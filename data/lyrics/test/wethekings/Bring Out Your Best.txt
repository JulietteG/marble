And I'll take you home and show you love
Under the sheets well make this night seem like its way too short
Your hair rest gently on your chest
And girl Im such a mess for falling into this

I place myself for you
Cause thats all I can do

Make sure you know to bring out your best
Well make this last until the night its done
Well listen to the sounds of our hearts beating fast
We dove at first, just look at what weve done
We were right to be so wrong, this time

And Ill lead you up the stairs
Your knees get weaker with a step
Youre taking to the room
Your cheeks plus redder that your lips
I feel your breath reach on my neck
You lock the door behind my back

I place myself for you
Cause thats all I can do

Make sure you know to bring out your best
Well make this last until the night its done
Well listen to the sounds of our hearts beating fast
We dove at first, just look at what weve done
We were right to be so wrong, this time

Uh uh, lalala, uh uh
Uh uh, lalala, uh uh

Make sure you know to bring out your best
Well make this last until the night its done
Well listen to the sounds of our hearts beating fast
We dove at first, just look at what weve done
We were right to be so wrong, this time

And Ill take you home and show you love
Under the sheets well make this night seem like its way too short
(We were right to be so wrong, this time)
And Ill take you home and show you love
Under the sheets well make this night seem like its way too short
(We were right to be so wrong, this time)---Lyrics submitted by isabel.
