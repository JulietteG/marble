Five minutes left until daylight
Four million reasons not to say goodbye
Three words that won't even describe
The two of us are one of a kind

Come get a little closer to my side
To my side
Closer to my side
To my side

We feel in love under the stars
You held me close and stole my heart
We lit the sky and made it ours
From here to Mars

We're in love
We're in love
We're in love ah ah
We're in love
We're in love ah ah

You could see the love in both our hearts
Like shooting stars
From here to Mars

Forever lost inside your eyes
Every galaxy spinning inside
The view from here is so sublime
The kind that turns the day to the night

Come get a little closer to my side
To my side
Closer to my side
To my side

We feel in love under the stars
You held me close and stole my heart
We lit the sky and made it ours
From here to Mars

We're in love
We're in love
We're in love ah ah
We're in love
We're in love ah ah

You could see the love in both our hearts
Like shooting stars
From here to Mars

We feel in love under the stars
You held me close and stole my heart
We lit the sky and made it ours
From here to Mars

We're in love
We're in love
We're in love ah ah
We're in love
We're in love ah ah

You could see the love in both our hearts
Like shooting stars
From here to Mars---
