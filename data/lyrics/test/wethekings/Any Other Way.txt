I am wide awake
And I'm standing tall
Up against the world
Up against the wall

Between the love and hate
They can hardly wait
To watch the hero fall

[Bridge:]
You could give me hell
You could give me death
Right before I bend
I will have revenge

Fire through my veins
I will fan the flames
Until my dying breath

[Chorus:]
'Cause I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way (way)

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way

Feel the poison now
Slipping through my skin
I'm not giving up
But I'm giving in

To my darker side
To my every sin
So I can fight again

[Bridge:]
You could give me hell
You could give me death
Right before I bend
I will have revenge

Fire through my veins
I will fan the flames
Until my dying breath

[Chorus:]
'Cause I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way (way)

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way

Woah oh oh
Ohh oh oh
Woah oh oh
Ohhh

Any other way

Woah oh oh
Ohh oh oh
Woah oh oh
Ohhh

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way
I will never go down
Any other way

I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way (way)

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way
I will never go down
Any other way

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way
I will never go down
Any other way

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

I will never go down
Any other way
Any other way

Woah oh oh
Ohh oh oh
Woah oh oh
Ohhh

Woah oh oh
Ohh oh oh
Woah oh oh
Ohhh

Woah oh oh
Ohh oh oh
Woah oh oh
Ohhh

Woah oh oh
Ohh oh oh
Woah oh oh
Ohhh ---
