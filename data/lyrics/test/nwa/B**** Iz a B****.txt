A B*tch Iz A B*tch

[Eazy-E]
Oh, sh*t. I guess there's one less b*tch you gotta worry about.

[Narrator]
Let's describe a certain female. A female with the disease of character
and attitude. If you will, a snob. However, in a view of NWA...

[Ice Cube]
A b*tch is a b*tch (b*tch)
So if I'm poor or rich (word up)
I talk in the exact same pitch
Now, the title b*tch don't apply to all women
But all women have a little b*tch in 'em (yeah)
It's like a disease that's plagues their character
Takin' the women of America (yeah)
And it starts with a letter B
It makes a girl like that think she better than me (b*tch)
See, some get mad and some just bury
But, yo, if the shoe fits wear it (wear it)
It makes 'em go deaf in the ear
That's why when you say 'hi' she won't say 'hi'
Are you the kind that think you're too damn fly?
B*tch eat sh*t 'n die (ha, ha)
Ice cube comin' at you at crazy pitch
(Why?) I think a b*tch is a b*tch

'Who the f*ck you think you're callin' a b*tch you little ? muthaf*cka?
I dunno who the f*ck you think you're talkin' to. Let me tell you one
muthaf*ckin' thang, I'm not a...' [Eazy E] 'B*tch, shut the f*ck up.'

Yo, you can tell a girl that's out for the money (How?)
She look good and the b*tch won't phony
She ain't no dummy she's right the ...
Yo, b*tch f*ck when I'm driving
See a young n*gga that's striving
You're thru' without a BMW
That's why a b*tch is a b*tch
I guess, or ether P-M-S
Here, test the girl that's kinda snobby (a'ight)
And I bet you dis a n*gga is her hobby
And after she finished the test
Write today a B-*-T-C-H
And watch her get mad 'cause she know it's true (she know it)
But a n*gga like me, I say 'f*ck you'
Do like Ice Cube, slam her a$$ in a ditch (slam her a$$)
'Cause a b*tch is a b*tch

'Why I gonna be a b*tch?'
'I ain't call you no b*tch. If you'd listen to a godd*mn song it'd tell
you what a b*tch is.'
'F*ck the song 'cause I'm not no muthaf*ckin' b*tch.'
'I didn't say you was a b*tch.'
'F*ck you, punk-a$$ n*gga!'
'F*ck you, b*tch!
'F*ck you! Who the f*ck you think you are?
'F*ck you! Suck my d*ck, b*tch!

I once knew a b*tch who got a slack
'Cause she playing me like she was all that
A b*tch can be your best friend talking behind your back (yeah)
About who's f*cking who and who's getting fat
Look at yourself for me, (look b*tch)
Now do you fall in this category?
Or you're the kind that won't bleak
'Cause you don't think, yo, sh*t stinks
Luckily I haven't had a drink
'Cause I'll down you a$$
Than I'll clown your a$$
'Cause the n*ggas I hang with ain't rich (I ain't rich)
We're all saying 'F*ck you b*tch!' (Word up!)
Now, what I can do with a hoe like you
Been your a$$ over then I'm thru'
? that you see Ice Cube ain't takin' no sh*t
(Why?) 'Cause I think a b*tch is a b*tch

[Narrator]
There you have it. The description of a b*tch. Now ask yourself,
are they talking about you? Are you that funky, dirty, money-hungry,
scandalous, stuck-up, hair piece contact wearing b*tch? Yep, you
probably are.

B*tch!---Lyrics submitted by Deanna.
