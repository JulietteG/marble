Oh girl, ooh girl... 

Hold your body close to mine 
Leave behind all of the worries on your mind 
I can see it in your eyes 
We've been waiting for this moment to arrive 

And you make me feel 
Feel so shiny and new 
Like I'll never be blue again 
And all magic feeling never fades 
I want to spend the rest of my days with you 

Love me in that special way 
Let your lips say what no words can ever say 
Lets not waste another day 
Lock the door and then we'll throw the key away 

Cause you make me feel 
Feel so shiny and new 
Like I'll never be blue again 
And all magic moment feel so right
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

Oh girl, only you make me feel brand new 
Oh girl, you make me feel brand new
Oh girl, you make me feel brand new
Oh girl, you make me feel brand new
Oh girl, you make me feel brand new---Lyrics submitted by marty.
