We took the long and staedy road
And from the start you had a heart of gold
You broke the mold
I never thought you would decide
The grass was greener on the other side
Of love's divide

You were everything that I wanted and more
Now we can't go back where we started
We'll never be like before

(Chorus)
Darling me and you, we had a strange arrangement
But you broke all the rules
And I'm through playing the fool for love
Darling yes it's true, we had a grand engagement 
But I can't stand by, while you break my heart in two
Oooh, I've got to be a man
Baby I've got to take a stand, so

So now we've gone our seperate ways
But in my heart I feel the burning flames
Of love's remains
I'll have to find somebody new
But all who dare will be compared to you
What can I do

You were everything that I dreamed I would find
Now we can't go back where we started
This is the end of the line

(Chorus 2x)---Lyrics submitted by Jeph.
