You know baby, 
I know you think we can make it all work out
But I gotta tell it like it is
And I don't wanna make this any harder than it needs to be
So don't cry

Don't wanna see your tears
Baby it'll be okay
Don't wanna see you cry darling
No way
We just don't feel the same
I know what your about
And I guess that I don't love you anymore
And I'm sorry
But it just ain't workin' out

(Chorus)
Uuuh aah, I'm sorry
Just ain't gonna work out
Just ain't gonna work out girl
Uuuh aah, I'm sorry
Just ain't gonna work out
Just ain't gonna work out girl

Don't want you to be sad girl
Don't want you to be afraid
I know that you will understand my ways
One Day
No need to be upset girl
Please don't scream and shout
I know that you were hearing wedding bells
But I'm sorry
'Cause it just ain't workin' out

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
