Friday night and the scene is bright at (Avilon)
I walk straight to the bar in a party dress, yes
I told the bartender pour a shot and make it strong

Because she need it, tearing up
She proceeded to be drunk
You can see it, tearing up
You can see it in her eyes

Refrain:
But when she gets home
She puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song
And fades away
When the musics on
She can do no wrong
Where she feels safe and calm
And its okay

Chorus:
And she says
Papaparapaprapa the world keeps turning it goes on
Yeah shell say
Papaparapaprapa the world keeps turning it goes on

Night before, had a date with a boy from (Avilon)
Said he'd meet her at the diner at 9 oclock
(laid the boots on line and laid on extra don)
She got a table set for two
But he never made it through
And she tried to play it cool
While she cried

Refrain:
But when she gets home
She puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song
And fades away

When the musics on
She can do no wrong
Where she feels safe and calm
And it's okay

Chorus:
And she says
Papaparapaprapa the world keeps turning it goes on
Yeah shell say
Papaparapaprapa the world keeps turning it goes on

Got to shake it off, shake it,
Got to shake it off shake it
Got to shake it off, shake it
Got to shake it off

Got to shake it off, shake it,
Got to shake it off shake it
Got to shake it off, shake it
Got to shake it off

Chorus:
And she says
Papaparapaprapa the world keeps turning it goes on
Yeah shell say
Papaparapaprapa the world keeps turning it goes on

Got to shake it off, shake it,
Got to shake it off shake it
Got to shake it off, shake it
Got to shake it off---
