I'm a genuine man, don't tell me no lies, yeah
And I know that look that you show is just a disguise

So if you have been untrue
And you've been with someone new
Oh baby, just let me know
Yeah baby, just let me know
If I'm not your one man only, tell me so

I'm a logical man don't want to play games, yeah
And I know that something is wrong you're acting so strange

So if you have been untrue
And you've been with someone new
Oh baby, just let me know
Yeah baby, just let me know
If I'm not your one man only, tell me so

Do do do do do do do do do, do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do-do do do
Do do-do do do

Well I'm a confident man, no jealous guy, yeah
But you know you're making it worse each day that goes by

So if you have been untrue
And you've been with someone new
Oh baby just let me know
Yeah baby, just let me know

Cause if I found out for certain
That you've been out there flirting
Baby I can't take that hurting no more

Oh, I can't take no more
Darling let me know
Woo, I can't take no more
Darling let me know---Lyrics submitted by marty.
