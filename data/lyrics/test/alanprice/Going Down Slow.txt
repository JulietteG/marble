Well Ive had my fun, if I dont get well no more 
Well Ive had my fun, if I dont get well no more 
You see my health is fadin me
Lord, and Im going down slow, going down slow.

I said mother, please don't send me no doctor.
You know the doctor can't do me no good.
Mother, please don't send me no doctor!
I tell you the doctor can't do me no good.
I know it is all my fault that I didn't do the things that I should.

On that next train south, you can look for my clothes on 
Oh, on that next train south, I can tell you to look for my clothes on, 
Just my clothes are coming home.
And, if you dont see my body,
All you can do, all you gotta do, all you gotta do is moan

Well Ive had my fun, if I dont get well no more 
Mother please don't worry, I tell you this is all in my prayer, all in my prayer.
If you don't see me anymore 
You know, Im just be gone out of this world somewhere, 
out of this world somewhere.---Lyrics submitted by Paul Reus.
