I am creative
Word is born
Word to Careen
Cart a word to killing
Word to calling
Word to Sophie
I can always try harder, it is one
Im a father, yes 
Im a father
Im a foreigner
Im a worrier
We will catch the light at the end of the corridor
Believe me
There are bountiful lines
Breaking true me mind
Most wonderful word
I ever heard
Like salable sentence
I wonder if they make senses and shit
Booth ho give a fuck if shit if she is hot like Nirvana
I mean hotter than lava
Destiny making me to try her
While history making me ride he

Im ready now
Bring it one
An open door scenario
Ocean of you
I file you grove
Body smoothed
I dive into an ocean of you

No shine like a disco ball
Reflection is in my mind
I can see it all
She is beautiful
I still blow 
Hit my, be real 
It is too good to be true
Year I now
What they say
In the brightest day 
We have the sunshine in some way
Place
I keep working one then ice
You only get one chance
Whey would I think twice

The night is right 
Se hart to spot
Me and She looking at the sky
The stars is strait
We are behind this
And there is no turning point
It now and never
True the coin
Investigating 
The track is insane
The fire burning
Like catching flames
Im running out of oxygen
Still Im going in

Im ready now
Bring it one
An open door scenario
Ocean of you
I file you grove
Body smoothed
I dive into an ocean of you

Turn this musics
We turning this music op high
You got my word
You can have this song to night
So hold you berth
Put the rest of the world to the side
Just go do it, dive in to it
Ocean

Im ready now
Bring it one
An open door scenario
Ocean of you
I file you grove
Body smoothed
I dive into an Ocean of you

Deep blue eyes
Ocean of you
Deep bule eyes---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
