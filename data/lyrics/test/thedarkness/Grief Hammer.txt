Ahhh Yeah!
(Grief)
Yes it's Grief Hammer time
(Hammer)

(Grief)
Yeah it's Grief Hammer time

D-I-Why not,
Commission my erection
Tool for hire,
Manual love
Rigger boots and dungarees,
And a grimace

(Grief)
Yes it's Grief Hammer time
(Hammer)

(Grief)
Yeah it's Grief Hammer time

It's an odd job,
But someone's gotta do it
Jack of all trades,
Masters of Love
I'm a handy man to have around,
In a fight

(Grief)
Yes it's Grief Hammer time
(Hammer)

(Grief)
Yeah it's Grief Hammer time

(Hammer Time)
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer,
Oh it's Hammer Time!

Yeah it's Grief Hammer time
(Grief)---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
