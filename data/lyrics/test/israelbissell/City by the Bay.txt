Theres something about the city that goes beyond the pretty lights 
reflecting off the silent waters of the sleeping bay.
Ships and boats all anchored deep gently rock themselves to sleep 
dreaming of a windy breeze to billow masted sails.

For those not in the galley, huddled in the alleys always 
damp and belly hungry in a port of dry docked fear.
Morning sun removes the shadows revealing stiffened limbs, 
gallow bound with squeaking shopping carts they drift upon the land.

Each day they sail hardened waters, rag doll seamen, city fodder 
adrift upon uncharted streets of untrusting stares.
A penny saved, a penny earned cresting onward they have learned 
is the only way to reach safe anchorage from the sleepy bay.

Tide pool potholes of pity, hidden from the pretty sight seers, 
looking for a bargain before boarding for their cruise.
For those who breakfast from a can, anther day of seaweed, sand 
and rowing carts while seagulls steal the crust of bread theyve saved.

Theres something about the city that goes beyond the pretty lights 
reflecting off the silent waters of the sleeping bay.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
