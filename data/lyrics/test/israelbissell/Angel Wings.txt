Her hand in mine, fingers entwined 
like a gentle weave of Battenburg lace.
No need to look for angelic wings 
as I feel them flutter a breeze on my face.

From all she could pick from, I was the chosen one. 
Her guardians touch settle my soul.
The key to my spirit kept close to her heart. 
How lucky am I to have her to hold me.

CHORUS:
Angle wings, watch over me. Keep me from floating away.
Angle wings do not release or like a ballon I would sail away.

Her smile could push the clouds away. 
Hair flowing, an auburn cascade.
She is my Northstar, keeps me on course. 
Protects me from those who would try to enforce me.

What right have I to deserve such glory. 
Why does she stay with such a sad story as me.
Arms wrapped around me Im always amazed. 
Im kept alive by her angle gaze.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
