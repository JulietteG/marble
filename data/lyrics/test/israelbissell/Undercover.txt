There was a time, when things were so fine.
It wasnt so very long ago. But then those times changed, 
got rearranged. Somewhere you lost control.

It was all so easy. And you were so pleasing. 
Just too damn appealing, they wouldnt let go.

Beneath flashing lights, glaring so bright. 
You gave them too much time to focus. 
Backing away, you hid in the shade, hoping no one would notice.

Dressed incognito, unleashing your ego, 
shades pulled cross windows so you could blend in.

Therell be a time, when things will be fine. 
Its not so long in the coming.
A masterful change, so carefully arranged. 
Can you hear the tall drummer beating.

It was all so easy. And you were so pleasing. 
Just too damn appealing, but then you let go. 

There was a time, when things were so fine. It wasnt so very long ago.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
