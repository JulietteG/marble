Haven't I seen 
Your face before
In some crowded place
Or maybe out
At a movie
It's too familiar to me boy
But I can't fill the space
Of where we met
or how we got there.

Maybe it was at the park
or at a dance after dark
Or a friend in the neighborhood
Where ever it may have been
I'm thanking God now
For then
'Cause I really do 
Think that I know you

Do I know you
Is it possible
Do I know you
Where do we, do I know
Do I know you 
Is it possible, yeah
Do I know you

I know that I've seen your face before
In some crowded place 
or maybe I'm just dreaming
Your the one I've been looking for
and it's been all my life
And it feels so right
I'm so sure

I've come to far 
to just pretend
You're the gold at rainbow's end
I'm so glad that I found you
Please believe and 
Don't say no
Take my hand and
Don't let go
Let me open the door
Do I know You

Do I know you
Is it possible
Do I know you
Where do we, do I know
Do I know you
Is it possible, yeah
Do I know you---Lyrics submitted by tara.
