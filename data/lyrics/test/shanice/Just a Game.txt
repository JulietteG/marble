If you're not
In love with me
Why do you
Pretend to me
Could it be 
It's all just a game
To you

I put all 
of my faith in you
Trying to be
What you wanted 
Me to
Still it seems
It's all just a game
To you

I try hard to understand it
I don't know 
whether or not you planned it
Can't you see
That love is meant 
For two

If you go
I won't regret
Won't spend time
Trying hard to forget
I'll just know
It's all just a game 
To you

I try hard to understand it
I don't know
whether or not you planned it
Can't you see
That love is meant
For two
That love is meant
For two
That love is meant 
For two
But it's all just a game
To you---Lyrics submitted by tara.
