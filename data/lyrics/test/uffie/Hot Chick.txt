On my way to Miami 
I see all kind of freak 
From icky-sticky bitches 
To fetish friendly tricks 
When I go out 
Some like get me drunk and wild 
But the only thing you get tonight 
Is my fucking drink tab 

Yes I'm like 
Hot chick that you can't even touch 
I'm like this cold ass bitch and 
I ain't ready to suck 
Uffie is here the boys are screaming 
And the club is packed 
And this one is for all my ladies 
Who like to shake it like that 

So get your ass on the floor 
Down to the floor 
Take your ass on the floor 
Down to the floor 
Take your ass on the floor 
Down to the floor 
Take your ass on the floor 
Down to the floor 

Take your ass on the floor 
Down to the floor 
Tap your funky dancing shoes 
I can't hear I want more 
Don't you stop 
Yes I want to see you're getting hot 
Uffie has got the hottest tracks 
And the shit on lock 
You've got me 
Kick up the sounds 
So I'm tearing this sound 
and you can spin a little faster 
I still rippin this song 
They call me uff 
Yes I'm young but I ain't givin' a fuck 

If you got beef I thought you knew 
I am ready to fuck, oh 
It can't be stopped, no 
We stop the rock 
So viciously that you don't even want us to stop 
I came to dance and shake on this t-t-t-techno shit 
But it sound a little fresher when uffie rock the b-b-b-b-b-beat 

In the club 
I am tired to hear the same techno shit 
With all the dancing crap 
It's just a road of hits 
Where as the sound I like to hear 
That keep me shaking my ass 
I like an electronic beat 
With a vocal that kick ass 

I've groovin' in the USA 
Cause my first track is like a commercial for NRA 
But I feel great rocking Europeans on this club scene 
I put my dirty plot out there cause it is too fucking clean 
And that's right 
Have another drink 
I want to party hard 
Maybe roll out the fucking weed 
We gonna party hard 
Till the sunrise 
We gonna get all sticky n shit 
But you don't care as long as me and dj feats drop the heat 

I'm like hot chick 
That you can't even touch 
I'm, I'm like hot chick 
That you can't even touch 
I'm, I'm like hot chick 
That you can't even touch...---Lyrics submitted by Tess.
