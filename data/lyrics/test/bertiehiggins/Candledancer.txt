I remember well, your flashing eyes
Soft and green as key lime pie
And how they filled with love
when you looked at me
And the shadows upon the wall at night

As you danced for me by the candle light
If only once more I could see
My candledancer, my young island girl
Your love was the answer
It lit up my world
Though the candle light is gone
The fire still lingers on
Give me one more chance
Dance

The dejavu of days with you
The sun so bright, the sea so blue
Somehow I thought it could ever end
But here I am alone tonight
Staring into the candle light
Trying so hard to pretend

I see my candledancer
My young island girl
Your love was the answer
It lit up my world
Though the candle light is gone
The fire still lingers on
Give me one more chance
Dance

My candledancer
My young island girl
Your love was the answer
It lit up my world
Though the candle light is gone
The fire still lingers on
Give me one more chance
Dance---Lyrics submitted by tracey stewart.
