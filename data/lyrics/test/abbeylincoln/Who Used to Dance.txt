It was very long ago
but I remember still,
the house with many many rooms
that stood upon a hill.
The life that was surrendered
comes to haunt us from the grave,
all in pieces, torn asunder,
like the body of the brave.

Who used to dance
with spreaded wings
and wore a bangle, an earring,
who used to dance.

Who used to dance
and do a show
and tell a story of long ago.
And sing and dance

And run a mile
in hot pursuit
and charm a serpent with a flute,
and build some monuments of stone,
the ones no longer called our own.

Who used to dance
and now who grinds
a way of life, a road that winds
Who used to dance.

Who used to dance
and play a drum
and send a message on the one,
Who used to dance.

Who used to dance
and measure time
and look to heaven for a sign
Who used to dance.

And calculate the river's flow
and build a chariot to go;
the ones who carried staffs and rods
and wrote some stories of the Gods.

Who used to dance and call the rain,
but nowadays
who rides the train
who used to dance

Who used to dance
Who used to dance
Who used to dance
Who used to dance
Who used to dance
Who used to dance
Who used to dance---Lyrics submitted by Teemu Mki.
