(refrain)

The birds who live in cages
never spread their wings.
They sit with ruffled feathers
on the tiny swings,
and speculate the bird seed
and while away the day,
and tuck their heads in feathers
of a colorful array.

(chorus)

I know why the caged bird sings
A sweet and soulful song.
I know why the caged bird sings
and flaps it's tethered wings.
Birds were made to fly away,
and birds were made to sing.

(refrain)

The birds who live in cages
feel the morning sun,
Shining through the window,
where the captor lives by gun,
and stretches forth its body
and warbles for the day,
looks around from side to side,
and listens for the way.

(chorus)

I know why the caged bird sings
A sweet and soulful song.
I know why the caged bird sings
and flaps it's tethered wings.
Birds were made to fly away,
and birds were made to sing.---Lyrics submitted by Teemu Mki.
