Love, I believed your illusions;
your kiss and your eyes
I thought they were mine.

But love of my dreams you betrayed me
You said I was yours
and I felt secure,

But now you have gone
and I've only this song
To sing, sigh, shout love's cry

Life does not care
you have left me
alone without love or you

The love that we shared
Now has passed, should I care;
To live, love, you, me, oh
life does not care
You have left me
alone without love or you---Lyrics submitted by Teemu Mki.
