I thought I could walk on water
I always felt so strong
I thought I had so the answers
How could I be so wrong

Time has a way of showing
The fool that I might have been
I see your face in the mirror
What wail tomorrow bring

ONLY YOU keep me warm like you do tonight
ONLY YOU in my darkness a guiding light
ONLY YOU

Like a wave on the ocean
I never changed direction
Always goin' through the motions
Nothing had a hold on me

Something in the way you touch me
No one does it quite the same
No one e!se could ever move me
You're a feeling I can'? explain

ONLY YOU keep me wormlike you do tonight
ONLY YOU in my darkness a guilding light
ONLY YOU make everything feel so right
ONLY YOU, only you

Now I need you more than ever
Baby I can't let go
I was goin' mod without you
This is just to let you know

ONLY YOU keep me warm like you do tonight
ONLY YOU in my darkness a guiding light
ONLY YOU make everything feel so right
ONLY YOU---Lyrics submitted by tac.
