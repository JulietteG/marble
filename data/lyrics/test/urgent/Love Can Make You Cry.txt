What makes us fly?
What makes us fall?
Why does it hurt,
crumble at night?

Since you've been gone,
I carry on...
Waiting for you,
to walk through the door

(REFRAIN1)
The more I think of you
The more I want to say,
I miss you...

(CHORUS)
The start of our love
will alive..(i'll be alive)
love can make you cry
I don't know how,
I don't know why?(i don't know)
Love can make you cry

So many things,i don't
understand..
You were always there
hold my hand.

If love is blind,
then just give me time.
I know we can start over again..

(REFRAIN2)
Coz' the more i think of you,
the more i want to say,
I love you...

(REPEAT CHORUS)

ohoho...hoho...
Love can make you cry
ohoho..hmmm..
Love can make you cry
ohoho.....---Lyrics submitted by pauline.
