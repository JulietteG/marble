Yesterday has taken my tomorrows
My empty heart can't take no more
It's hard to live with no-one to follow
Where's the hope I once had before?

I watch the seasons fade
My face still out of place
Each step I can't deny I'm in trouble, tell me

[Chorus]
How can I live without somebody like you?
Somebody like you, please tell me
How can I live without somebody like you
Please tell me it's over, it's almost over

So many things in this room remind me
Of being here next to you
These scars consume my mind and body
Where's the hope that I once knew?

I watch the season's fade
My face still out of place
Each step I can't deny I'm in trouble, tell me

[Chorus]

I'm sitting and listening, laughing and wondering
I'm watching the stars go by
Everything reminds me of you
And I can't get you off my mind
How can I live, how can I live
How can I live without you in my life?

[Chorus]

How can I live without you? (How can I live?)
I'm watching the stars go by
How can I live without you? (How can I live?)
When I can't get you off my mind---Lyrics submitted by bryndis.
