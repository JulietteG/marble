All these spoken words,
And broken dreams.
This misery.
All that's good is gone in me.
With every breath,
I can't escape the pain, it's caving in.
I am just about to break.

Every time i close my eyes,
I can't escape these lies.
Will i make it through to the other side?

I can't breathe when i am suffocating.
Committed yesterday, now i am over my head.
I can't breathe when it's complicated.
It's falling down on me,
I send it back on you.

Get away. away, get away.

All these years i try,
N' nothings changed.
I'm about to break
I sacrificed myself.
With every breath,
I can't escape the pain.
This misery.
What's good is gone in me.

Every time i close my eyes,
I can't escape these lies.
Will i make it through to the other side?

I can't breathe when i am suffocating.
Committed yesterday, now i am over my head.
I can't breathe when it's complicated.
It's falling down on me,
I send it back on you.
I send it back on you.

I can't breathe when i am suffocating.
Committed yesterday, now i am over my head.
I can't breathe when it's complicated.
It's falling down on me,
I send it back on you.

It's complicated.
I'm been over my head still.
I am suffocating.
It's falling down on me.
I send it back on you.

Get away. away, get away.---Lyrics submitted by david.
