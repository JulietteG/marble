I'm barely breathing
I'm barely alive
When did yours come tumblin down?

Your actions speak louder
Than all of the thunder
That you brought back
Down on me

I won't be, I won't be your hero
I won't be your superman
Everything I did was for you
Everything you said was a lie
My pain, your gain
Who's your hero today?
Who's your hero?

No more second chances
No more lies
This time you're going down
Your days are empty
Your nights are black
I won't be the reason
You fall this time

I won't be, I won't be your hero
I won't be your superman
Everything I did was for you
Everything you said was a lie
My pain, your gain
Who's your hero today?

I won't be, I won't be your
I won't be, I won't be your hero
Everything I Did was for you
Everything you said was a lie
My pain, your gain
Who's your hero today?
Who's your hero?
Who's your hero?---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
