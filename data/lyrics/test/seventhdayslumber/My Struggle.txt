Chorus

There must be some misake cause I'm not worth the price you payed
With every passing hour I convince myself you saw something in me
But I can hear them still, as the whispers laced with hatred fill the room
Guess I'm waisting my time, how could you love a man like me?

Lord I need you strength cause I am weak and falling to my knees
And who is on my side, cause I can't tell my friends from enemies
Filling up with pain. Bitterness controls the air I breathe. What am I fighting for? 
Do you have a plan for me?

Chorus
Must be some mistake cause I'm not worth the price you paid.
With every passing hour I convince myself you saw something in me
But I can hear them still, as the whispers laced with hatred fill the room
Guess I'm wasting my time, how could you love a man like me?


Must be some mistake cause I'm not worth the price you paid.---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
