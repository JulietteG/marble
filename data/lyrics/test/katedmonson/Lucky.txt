Happiness 
Feels like this
Your heart upon your sleeve
There's a place
In time and space
Where we can all be free

So meet me at the rainbow's end
We don't even have to pretend
That we know what it is we're looking for
We're looking for

Life is just a dream
Lucky you
Lucky lucky me

Life is just a dream
Lucky you
Lucky lucky me

Have you found 
Higher ground
Or are you lost at sea
Do you know
Where you go
Is where I want to be

So cast your troubles into the sky
They can be the stars in our eyes
And we can count them on another day
From far away

Life is just a dream
Lucky you
Lucky lucky me

Life is just a dream
Lucky you
Lucky lucky me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
