Slip Into Something Morecomfortable and proceede into space.

Innocent Indaviduals..Concerned about nothing but happiness
Progress becomes easy due to the social Situation..Unfortunate turn of events Collapse this Idea of childish Thought...

No Judgment..No Judgment..Towards One AnotherNo Social Staus to Compare..All as one..Market this cgange..Expliot the ideaof innocents Goddamn television god... corupt me...Seperate Us.. Groups of Difference seem to comfort what we once didn't think of this Show was in there head for years...Enjoy this life wonder and Imagination.. For it will Be Torn Down...

You Will Be Torn Down
Time To Hate..Kill, Fight, Conquer
This Is Human Lie At It's Best...We'll Televise this event
You Can Learn How To Live, Breath..Then Finally Die...
(This Sweet Relief is a must) We Can Speak Obsession.. We Can Love The Endless---Lyrics submitted by daniel.
