He was sweet as cotton candy
at a county fair.
He's a cold drink of water with
butterscotch hair
He swore that he loved me
well I guess he probably did
Cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
I saw my name next to his

A new tattoo stinging like a hornet
Two little hearts like a big red warning
I wasn't looking for a permanent  thing
First comes the ink then comes the ring

Bye bye baby
i bet we could've made a bunch of 
sweet memories
you should've slowed down mister
moving like a twister's just a little to fast for me
So now its zero to 60 and if you ever
miss me
I'm right there on your arm
Don't cry I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a double heart

Well he's a tough bronc buster
I'll bet he sleeps in his boots
Well he tried to throw a rope around me
right out of the shoes, yeah
he swore he loved me
well I guess he probably did
Cause when he rolled up his sleeve one day
I thought here we go again

A new tattoo buring like a brand
Two little hearts on my rodeo man
I wasn't looking for a permanent thing
First comes the ink then comes the ring

Bye bye baby
i bet we could've made a bunch of 
sweet memories
you should've slowed down mister
moving like a twiste just a little to fast for me
So now its zero to 60 and if you ever
miss me
I'm right there on your arm
Don't cry I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a double heart

Woo hoo Woo hoo
I'm a free bird
Woo hoo Woo hoo
I'm a free bird

Bye bye baby
i bet we could've made a bunch of 
sweet memories
you should've slowed down mister
moving like a twister just a little to fast for me
So now its zero to 69 and if you ever
miss me
I'm right there on your arm
Don't cry I'll leave you something behind
Skid marks and a... skid marks and a ....
Skid marks and a double heart
Well I'm a free bird---Lyrics submitted by leia murphy.
