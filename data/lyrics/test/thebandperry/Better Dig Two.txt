I told you on the day we wed 
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead 
Made you wait 'til our wedding night 
That's the first and the last time I'll wear white 

So if the ties that bind ever do come loose 
Tie 'em in a knot like a hangman's noose 
Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell 
Before I'll see you with someone else 

Put me in the ground 
Put me six foot down 
And let the stone say: 

"Here lies the girl whose only crutch 
Was loving one man just a little too much" 
If you go before I do 
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two 

Well, 
It won't be whiskey, won't be meth 
It'll be your name on my last breath 
If divorce or death ever do us part 
The coroner will call it a broken heart 

So put me in the ground 
Put me six foot down 
And let the stone say: 

"Here lies the girl whose only crutch 
Was loving one man just a little too much" 
If you go before I do 
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two 

Dig two 
Ooh, ooh 

I took your name when I took those vows 
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now, 
Oh, right now 

If the ties that bind ever do come loose 
If "forever" ever ends for you 
If that ring gets a little too tight 
You might as well read me my last rites 

And let the stone say: 

"Here lies the girl whose only crutch 
Was loving one man just a little too much" 
If you go before I do 
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh! 

There'll be a stone right next to mine, 
We'll be together 'til the end of time 
Don't you go before I do, 
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two 

I told you on the day we wed 
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead ---
