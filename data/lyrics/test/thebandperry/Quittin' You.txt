I don't know what i was thinkin'
you were no good but you could do some
fancy talkin'

I'm not your Trixie Delight
or a gumball machine
you can keep your quarter man 
'Cause you wont get nothing sweet out of me

I'm quittin' quittin' quittin'
I'm quittin you
Like a girl wants he chocolate, yeah 
I know that I'll miss you
But I'm quittin' quittin' quittin' 
I'm not kiddin' I'm kickin' you
'Cause your my bad habit and 
I'm quittin you

I don't know what the heck you were thinkin'
It's gonna gonna take a better man
I'm bettin', to win my hand

I'm not gonna play your game 
I don't like the high stakes 
I'd rather sit alone at home 
Playin' one more round of Old Maid

I'm quittin' quittin' quittin' 
I'm quittin' you 
Like a gambler leaving vegas, boy 
I know that i'll miss you 
But i'm quittin' quittin' quittin' 
I'm not kiddin' i'm kickin' you 
'Cause your my bad habit and i'm quittin'

Cold turkey
Giving you the cold shoulder 
off like a band-aid
one quick sting 
then its over

I'm quittin' quittin' quittin'
I'm not kiddin' i'm kickin' you
'Cause your my bad habit  
And the good Lord won't have it 
You're my bad habit and I'm quittin' you---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
