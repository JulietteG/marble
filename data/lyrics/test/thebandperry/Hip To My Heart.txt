I like your lips like i like my coca-cola yeah
oh how it pops and fizzes
you like my shirt like i like it when you hold my hand
the way it fits
its got me feeling lucky

Chorus*
lucky ooh its got me
ooh you got that something
boy i wanna be where you are
and im gunning for ya
cant even fall for some other man
cause brother man
you know how to get hip to my heart

Come on now!

All the girls in town
look you up and look you down
i know
so come on and pick your kitten
Pur baby pur
go ahead and say the word
lets go
i think im the one you're diggin'
got me feeling lucky

Chorus*
lucky ooh its got me
ooh you got that something
boy i wanna be where you are
and im gunning for ya
cant even fall for some other man
cause brother man
you know how to get hip to my heart

Tell me now

Coo coo cool

Chorus*

and im gunning for ya
cant even fall for some other man
cause brother man
