When i was just a young boy
My daddy came to me
Said son out in this world theres alot of things
Gonna make you feel like your supposed to be

You dont have to read the good book
To be a good man all the same 
Iam gonna forget about the money
Money aint brought nothin to your daddy but pain

It aint easy
It aint easy
but you'll be alright

Now it's fifteen years later 
Now i'am out on the road
And it's been four years till the day he died
They wont even play his songs on the radio

And i think i found my way alright 
Without him here to catch me now and again
I just keep on moving along
Keepin my mind on my songs and trying to fiqure out love

It aint easy
It aint easy
But we'll be alright

Any other fool
Any other fool
Would throw it away

Any other fool

I want to take a minute to thank you
For all the things that you have done
Yeh you gave me a light in the dark of night
when there was no place to hide nowhere to run

It aint easy
It aint easy (is it baby)
It aint easy
It aint easy
It aint easy

But we'll be alright
Be alright
Oh be alright

It aint easy---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
