Sometimes we're real close friends
We stay up late and talk at night
Other times we don't get along
There are even times we fight

But I know she's always there
And I know she'll always care
She's my sister, I love my sister

I've given her a great big hug
When she was feeling sad
But then again I've said somethings
That have really made her mad

But I know she's always there
And I know she'll always care
She's my sister, I love my sister

But I know she's always there
And I know she'll always care
She's my sister, I love my sister
She's my sister, I love my sister---Lyrics submitted by Angelica Swindle.
