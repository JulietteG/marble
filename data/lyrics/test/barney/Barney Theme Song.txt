Barney is a dinosaur from our imagination
And when he's tall
He's what we call a dinosaur sensation

Barney's friend are big and small
They come from lots of places
After school they meet to play
and sing with happy faces

Barney show us lots of things
Like how to play pretend 
ABC's and 123's
And how to be a friend

Barney comes to play with us 
Whenever we may need him
Barney can be your friend too
If you just make-believe him!---Lyrics submitted by MaryAngelie.
