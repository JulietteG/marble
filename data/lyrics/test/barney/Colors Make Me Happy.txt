Colors make me happy
Everywhere I go.
The world is like a rainbow.
Puttin' on a beautiful show.
Oh, puttin' on a beautiful show.

Looking around makes me smile
at how colorful the world can be.
From a snowflake to a butterfly,
Colors are beautiful to me.

Colors make me happy
Everywhere I go.
The world is like a rainbow.
Puttin' on a beautiful show.
Oh, puttin' on a beautiful show.

Eyes come in different colors,
so do the birds that fly.
The forests comes in of many greens,
and look at all the colors in the sky.

Colors make me happy
Everywhere I go.
The world is like a rainbow.
Puttin' on a beautiful show.
Oh, puttin' on a beautiful show.---Lyrics submitted by ma jonalyn.
