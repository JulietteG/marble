All the world's a stage and we're all the players,
A character was betrayed and i was her betrayer,
She didn't know so i didn't care,
Nobody told her, nobody dared,
They just stood there looking at me saying,

Lets sing songs from the dreamland massacre,
The dreamland massacre,
The dreamland massacre,
Lets sing songs from the dreamland massacre,
And lets sing songs for the killer inside,

______, ______, diamonds profiteer,
Profiting from tiers and profiting from bloodshed,
Profiting from years of living in my head,
Look between my ears, counter for the debt,

Did you hear what the mad cow said when she said,
Lets sing songs from the dreamland massacre,
The dreamland massacre,
The dreamland massacre,
Lets sing songs from the dreamland massacre,
And sing about the dreams that died,
And lets sing songs for the killer inside,
And sing about the dreams that died.

Lets sing songs from the dreamland massacre,
the dreamland massacre,
the dreamland massacre,
Lets sing songs from the dreamland massacre,
And sing about the dreams that died.---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
