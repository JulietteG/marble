Little one, how long I've waited here
Waited for so many lonely years
Nobody ever could make me smile
'Til you came 'round with your pretty style

And I will love you so
And I will love you so

'Cause I was made for you
And you were made for me
And that is all I know
You're all that I can see
'Cause I was made for loving you
And all the little things you do
Remind me who I am inside

Happiness is such a fickle thing
Nothing compares to what you can bring
You can bring meaning to what I do
That is why I want to be with you

And I will love you so
And I will love you so

'Cause I was made for you
And you were made for me
And that is all I know
You're all that I can see
'Cause I was made for loving you
And all the little things you do
Remind me who I am inside

My darling, I need you
I'd give myself to please you
My darling, I need you
I want you to be mine

'Cause I was made for you
And you were made for me
And that is all I know
You're all that I can see
'Cause I was made for you
And you were made for me
And that is all I know
You're all that I can see
'Cause I was made for loving you
And all the little things you do
Remind me who I am inside
Remind me who I am inside
Remind me who I am inside---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
