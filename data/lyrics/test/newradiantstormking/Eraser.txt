Over time, it gets better with each day
If you're ready and you're willing to move on
Now she's gone, you can wipe her face away
You can paint it
You can praise it in a song

Now you're freed up to focus on what's wrong
Get a shrink, Smoke and mirrors [unintelligible]
Write your lies up to such a great degree
You were so wrong
She was never the one

And all those turgid nights you spent
With her face emblazoned on your dreams
She never was what she seemed
Never what she seemed

And all that useless thought you have
Never got you anything 
Except a nose-less face
And the only thing to blame is arrogance

Over time it gets better with each day
If you're ready and your willing to move on
Now she's gone, you can wipe her face away---Lyrics submitted by J Whitehall.
