it can make a man feel like a king
or feel just like a clown
it can make him run for cover
or stay and stand his ground
it can make a man pick up the bottle
or help him lay it down
it can stop his whole world from turning
or turn his whole world around

CHORUS:
that's the power of a woman
it's the touch of her hand
one smile, one tear, one whisper in your ear
that's the power of a woman

it can make a man beg to jesus
or make him he wish he never asked
it can make him dream about the future
or make a nightmare of his past

CHORUS

she can so much 
without saying a word
that's just her
the power, of a woman
it's the touch of her hand
one smile, one tear, one whisper in your ear
that's the power of a woman
the power of a woman

she can make you feel like a king
or feel just like a clown.---Lyrics submitted by kaitlyn.
