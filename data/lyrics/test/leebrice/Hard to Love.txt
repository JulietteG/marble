I am insensitive
I have a tendency to pay attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink too much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you stay with me

I'm hard to love, hard to love
Oh, I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love
You say that you need me
Well I don't deserve it but 
I love that you love me good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like i do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish I could be more like you

I'm hard to love, hard to love
Oh, I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love
You say that you need me
Well I don't deserve it 
But I love that you love me good
Love me good

Girl, you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

I'm hard to love, hard to love
Oh, I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love
You say that you need me
Well I don't deserve it but I love that
You love me good

I'm hard to love, hard to love
Oh, I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love
You say that you need me
Well I don't deserve it but I love that
You love me good

You love me good

Love me good---
