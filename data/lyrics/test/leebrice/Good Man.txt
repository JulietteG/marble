Just like you know your southern stars always gonna come back out
Ill give you everything I got like nobody else you found
Open up your heart, open up your eyes, baby listen to the sound
Of my voice when I tell you girl dont worry I aint ever gonna let you down
I wanna show you where Im from, take you for a ride on a long dirt road
Let you see, let you taste, let you feel, just a little bit of that moonshine glow
I wont hold you down, or hold you back, but I wont let you go
This aint no one night show

I heard you lookin for a good man
To hold you with some good hands
Somebody get you through the bad land
So you lookin for a good man
Well you lookin at a good man now

I'll climb your tower, slay your dragons, fight your battles girl
Ill take a bullet for ya, Ill take on the whole world
Dont even worry bout it, I like it yeah, I gotcha girl
Cmon wont cha give it a whirl

I heard you lookin for a good man
To hold you with some good hands
Somebody get you through the bad land
So you lookin for a good man
Well you lookin at a good man now, aint cha girl

I ain't no bad boy, I used to be but I aint no more
(I ain't no bad boy, I ain't no bad boy)
I ain't no bad boy, I used to be but I ain't no more
(I ain't no bad boy)

So you lookin for a good man
To hold you with some good hands
Trust me Ill get you through the bad land
So you lookin for a good man
Well you you lookin at a good man now, aint cha girl...

Yeah ya lookin at a good man now aint cha girl---
