I know you're thinking' that you've got me all figured out
that a music man like me ain't ever gonna settle down
and you're just waiting' around for the day you convinced ain't gonna come
and just the thought of wedding bells would make me want to run away
Well All I can say

Is don't believe everything you think
baby, I might just have a ring in my pocket right now
so settle on down girl, reel that wild imagination in,
Baby, come on back to me again, Yeah, the mind's a funny thing
don't believe everything you think

Everytime a pretty girl comes walking by, I see your wheels turning
the way you watch my eyes, girl I don't know why
you let it cross your mind that I ain't crazy over you
and I don't want all the very same things you do
babe, all I'm gonna say

Is don't believe everything you think
baby, I might just have a ring in my pocket right now
so settle on down girl, reel that wild imagination in,
Baby, come on back to me again, Yeah, the mind's a funny thing
don't believe everything you think

Girl, you need to get on out of your head and into your heart instead

Is don't believe everything you think
baby, I might just have a ring in my pocket right now
so settle on down girl, reel that wild imagination back in,
Baby, come on back to me again, Yeah, the mind's a funny thing
don't believe everything you think

Ohh, yeah, the mind's a funny thing, don't believe everything you think ---
