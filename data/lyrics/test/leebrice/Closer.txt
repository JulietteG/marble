These last few days
What can I say
You've had me thinkin' in circles
In crazy not like me ways
My favorite thing
Lately has been waking up with you
Talkin' ourselves to sleep again

Baby come a little closer
Let me lay some nibble kisses on your shoulder
You said that's your favorite place
Baby maybe we could borrow
Find a way to bag and
Steal a few tomorrows and stay
Here in these last few days

These last few days
Have blown me away
The thought of letting go,And falling
Is actually feeling okay
I must confess
I need some rest
But with every touch
I swear the better it seems to get

Baby come a little close
Let me lay some nibble kisses on your shoulder
You said that your favorite place
Baby maybe we could borrow
Find a way to bag and
Steal a few tomorrows and stay
Here in these last few days

I ain't lookin' for love
But whatever this is
I can't get enough

Baby come a little closer
Let me lay some nibble kisses on your shoulder
You said that your favorite place
Baby maybe we could borrow
Find a way to bag and
Steal a few tomorrows and stay
Here in the last few days---
