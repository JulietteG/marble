Did you see me lookin cool
in my white t-shirt, and my cowboy boots, and
my baby blue starin at you from across the room?
Did you see me lookin at you?
Yes you did. I saw you lookin at me.

Did you see me lookin at your eyes, lookin
at your legs, lookin at your thighs, lookin
at your backside?
Did you see me lookin at your man?
I don't understand, what's a woman doin with
a boy like him? A boy like him.

I saw your man standin there and
I gave him a glare, and I swear he looked
pretty scared to me.
Well, I saw him swallow his pride, and I looked
deep in his eyes. And he decided he didn't
wanna take this outside. 

Cause Carolina boys get rowdy and loud. 
Yes we do. 
Don't look at me, I'll turn your whole world
upside down. 
Cause we are rowdy and loud.

Didn't mean to scare you with my rowdy redneck
friends, but I couldn't help but notice you walk in with him.
His three-piece suit and his penny-loafer shoes.
Girl tell me what I'm gonna do with you.

Do you wanna ride?
Do you wanna dance all night? 
Do you wanna take a little trip in my four-wheel drive?
Might get rowdy and loud. 

Now tell the truth, girl, you saw the new world
the moment you laid your pretty little eyes on me. 
Well, I'll give you somethin to think about, somethin
to talk about, tell the whole world about a boy like me. 

Cause Carolina boys get rowdy and loud. 
Don't look at me, I'll turn your whole world
upside down. 
Cause Carolina boys get rowdy and loud. 
Don't look at me, I'll turn your whole world
upside down. 
Cause we get rowdy. 
Known to get rowdy.
We get rowdy and loud.
 Loud. 

Girl. 
Take a walk out to my truck, baby.---Lyrics submitted by Sunny.
