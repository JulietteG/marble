I just got off work at 5
Drivin' that old van I drive
Overalls and dirty boots
But uncle Bill needed a funeral suit

So whe I walked in that fancy store
The looked at me like I was poor 
But a wad of hundred dollar bills caused a stir
It went from don't take checks, right away, yes sir.

Upper middle class white trash
My pockets can't hold all my cash
Cause one day I stopped to pee
Got some gas and won the lottery

Now I'm investin' in my neighborhood
My friends and family they're all livin' pretty good!
My trailer park's full of Cadillacs
And upper middle class white trash. 

Well I got my homeboy Chris, a brand new shop
For all those cars on cinder blocks
And cousin Charlie, he thinks it's cool
To keep a large mouth bass in his new swimmin' pool

I had a birthday party for momma last night
In her ninety and a half foot triple wide!
You ain't seen nothing if you ain't seen NASCAR
On a sixty inch plasma screen 

Upper middle class white trash
My pockets can't hold all my cash
Cause one day I stopped to pee
Got some gas and won the lottery

Now I'm investin' in my neighborhood
My friends and family they're all livin' pretty good!
My trailer park's full of Cadillacs
And upper middle class white trash. 

We're buyin' chicken wings by the bucket
We can't eat 'em all, we just say chuck it
All the Miller Light you can handle
A hundred and fifty-seven movie channels

Upper middle class white trash
My pockets can't hold all my cash
Cause one day I stopped to pee
Got some gas and won the lottery

Now I'm investin' in my neighborhood
My friends and family they're all livin' pretty good!
My trailer park's full of Cadillacs
And upper middle class white trash. 

So pop a top, sit back and relax
All you upper middle class white trash
Ha ha ha---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
