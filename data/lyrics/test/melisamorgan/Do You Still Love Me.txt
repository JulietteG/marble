Take a minute
to re-evaluate
all of the things
you said were special

Now I'm just a little on edge
about the way that you've
been treating me lately

After all 
we've been through

Do you still love me like you used to

Chorus:  
Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Do you still love me 
Do you still love

huh love

Take one minute to open up your eyes
and see how I'm feelin
Now I don't want to complain
But something just ain't the same
With the way you hold me

You know all my love is true to you
But do you still love me like you used to
I gotta know

Chorus:
Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Do you still love me
Do you still love

huh 
huh
huh

Do you still
Do you still

After all we've been through

do you still do you still love me like you use to

ahuh
na na na na na na 

ahuh

ahua ahua

it's alright

ahuha

la la la la la la la la la la la la

Take one minute

ahuh huh
oh do you stil love me
