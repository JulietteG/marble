Well, I tried to tell you so
Yes, I did
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flo'
Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And to show you that I'm with

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes I tried, yes I tried
You lied to me
Even though you know I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes I cried, yes I cried

Return of the Mack, there it is
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go

So, I'm back up in the game
Running things to keep my swing
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done
So baby listen carefully while I sing my comeback song

You lied to me, cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me, but you did, but you did
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack, there it is
Return of the Mack, hold on
Return of the Mack, don't you know
You know that I'll be back, here I go
Return of the Mack, oh little girl
Return of the Mack, once my pearl
Return of the Mack, up and down
You know that I'll be back, round and round

You lied to me, cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me, but you did, but you did
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack, it is
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, don't you know---
