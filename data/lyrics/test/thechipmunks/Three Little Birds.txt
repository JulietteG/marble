Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be alright

Baby don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be alright

Rise up this morning,
I'll be the rising sun
Three little birds
Just by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs
A melody of pure and true
Singing "This is my message to youu"

Baby dont worry, no no no
About a thing,about a thing
'Cause every little thing (oh!)
Is gonna be alright (Is gonna be alright)

Baby don't worry dont you worry
About a thing (Baby don't you worry about a thing)
'Cause every little thing (oooh!)
Is gonna be alright (yes it is)

Rise up this morning
I'll be the rising sun
Three little birds
Just by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs
A melody of pure and true
Singing "This is my message to youuu"
So pretty baby let me tell you

Baby don't worry don't you worry
About a thing(don't you worry about a thing)
'Cause every little thing (yeahh!)
Is gonna be alright (ooooh!)

Baby don't worry (No don't you worry)
About a thing (So don't you worry about a thing)
'Cause every little thing (ooh!)
Is gonna be alright (alright)

Baby don't worry (oh!)
About a thing (No don't you worry about a thing)
'Cause every little thing (Everything)
Is gonna be alright (yes it is,yes it is,yes it is!)

Baby don't worry (No don't you worry)
About a thing (So don't you worry about a thing)
'Cause every little thing (yeahh!)
Is gonna be alright---Lyrics submitted by Claudia.
