took me a while, but i'm finally here so i just want to testify  make it crystal clear.
see i been picked out to be picked on talked about out my friends mouth , i been beat down, til he turned my life around (turn my life around).

seem like i always fall short for being worthy, cause i aint good enough, but he still love me. i aint no super star, the spot light aint shinning on me (no no no no no), cause i aint good enough, but he still love me. LET ME! 

I use to wake up some days and wish i had stayed asleep, cause i went to bed on top of the world, today the world's on top of me. everybody have opinions (they shall) they aint been in my position (they dont know) that  it breaks my heart when i hear what they have to say about me.(what they say about you )

seem like im always failing short for bein worthy (lord i aint wrothy) cause i aint good enough (no) but he still love me(love me love) i aint no super star (i aint no super star, i want to be for you) the spot light aint shinning on me cause i aint god enough but he still love me (me me me) i'm not perfect, yes i do wrong (yes i do wrong) im trying my best but it aint good enough (trying my best ) shine by the world when i dont succeed. (when i dont succeed seed seed) i aint good enough (i aint good enough ) but he still love me 

if you aint worthy just raise your hand and let me know that you understand. that we are all so blessed to be loved (loved) stand for him to fall for anything cause through his eyes we all lookk the same. what will he do without blame.

seem like we always fall short for being worthy (we are nto worthy no) cause i aint good enough  but he still love me (aint good enough) i aint no super star spotlight aint shinning on me ( i aint no super star but i want to be for you lord) cause i aint good enough but he still love me (but he still love me me me me me me) im not perfect, yes i do wrong (im not perfect no) im trying my best but it aint good enough (i aint good enough shun by the world)if i dont succeed cause i aint good enough but he still love me

even though i aint worthy . you aint worthy he's there for you 
no matter what i do i anit good enough  but the lord still loves me---Lyrics submitted by Karen.
