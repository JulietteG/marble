There's a chair
In my head
On which I used to sit
Took a pencil and I wrote
The following on it:
Now there's a key where my wonderful mouth used to be
Dig it up and throw it at me
Dig it up and throw it at me

CHORUS:
Where can I run to?
Where can I hide?
Who will I turn to?
Now I'm in the virgin state of mind

Gotta a knife to disengage
The words that I can't bear
To cut out words 
I've got written on my chair
Like "do you think I'm sexy?"
"Do you think I really care?"

Can I burn the mazes I grow?
Can I, I don't think so.

Can I burn the mazes I grow?
Can I, I don't think so.

CHORUS:
Where can I run to?
Where can I hide?
Who will I turn to?
Now I'm in the virgin state of mind
Virgin state of mind (x3)---Lyrics submitted by Cheyenne.
