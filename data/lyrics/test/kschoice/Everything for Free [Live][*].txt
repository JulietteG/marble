I don't know who you are
but you seem very nice
so will you talk to me
shall i tell you a story 
shall i tell you a dream
they think i'm crazy
they don't know that i like it here 
it's nice in here
i get everything for free

Have you been here before
shall i show you around 
its very pretty
have you come here to stay 
well you sure picked a day 
my name is billy
its my birthday your invited to my party down the hall

where i go what i'll become or who I
and for what i'll be i'll never know
but i am sure that i'll get everything for free

i'm not troubled or sad 
i'm just ready for bed
it's been a long day 
before they shut out the light 
it truley was a delight 
they think i'm crazy
they don't know that i like it here
its nice in here


where i go what i'll become or who I
and for what i'll be i'll never know
but i am sure that i'll get everything for free

where i go what i'll become or who I
and for what i'll be i'll never know
but i am sure that i'll get everything for free
everything for free

i don't know who you are
but you seem very nice
so will you talk to me
have you been here befor 
well you sure picked a day
they think i'm crazy---Lyrics submitted by jennifer.
