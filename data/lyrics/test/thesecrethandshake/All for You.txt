One!
Everybody here is
Rooting for you
Two!
We all want to see
How good you're gonna do
Three!
Just hold on tight
And you'll be alright
Four!
After you've made it
We'll go home tonight

One!
I know that it's
Easy to be nervous
Two!
I know that you're
So, so scared
Three!
I know just how hard
You've practiced
And baby
We're almost there

You're gonna do it
Do it
Alright
You're gonna make it
Make it
Tonight
And even though they said
You'd never ever make it
They were wrong

And I believed in you
Before you believed
In yourself
(You can do anything you want to)
And I believed in you
Before you believed in
Snyone, anyone else

One!
I know that it's
Easy to be nervous
Two!
I know that you're
So, so scared
Three!
I know just how hard
You've practiced
And baby 
We're almost there

You're gonna do it
Do it
Alright
You're gonna make it
Make it
Tonight
And even though they said
You'd never ever make it
They were wrong

And I know things
Happen so hard
For you and me
But soon they'll be done
And they will be gone
And I know things
Happen so hard
For you and me
But soon they'll be done
And they will be gone

You're gonna do it
Do it
Alright
You're gonna make it
Make it
Tonight
And even though they said
You'd never ever make it
They were wrong

You're gonna do it
Do it
Alright
You're gonna make it
Make it
Tonight
And even though they said
You'd never ever make it
They were wrong

You're gonna do it
Do it
Alright
You're gonna make it
Make it
Tonight
And even though they said
You'd never ever make it
They were wrong---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
