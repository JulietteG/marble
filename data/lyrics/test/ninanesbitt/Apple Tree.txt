Once, Once upon a time
Thought that you'd be mine
But then you let your colours shine

I wanted to believe
That you were right for me
Wow how could I be so naive

Now we're broken
Forget me not
I'm falling down
And I can't stop

Let's go down to the apple tree
Naive as Adam and Eve
Oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

Let's go down to the apple tree
Fighting against gravity
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Falling too deep
So can you catch me

Twice, Twice I caught you out, 
My head was in the clouds,
Before I woke up and came around
To see

You played stupid games
Temptation in your way
'Cause I went so fast from love to hate

Now I'm broken
Was this your plan
I'm falling down 
And I don't understand

Let's go down to the apple tree
As naive as Adam and Eve
Oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

Let's go down to the Apple Tree
Fighting against gravity
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Falling too deep
So can you catch me

You keep playing
You keep playing
I'll keep praying
I'll keep praying
That we could have been us

You keep playing
You keep playing
I'll keep saying,
I'll keep saying,
That it should have been us

So let's go down to the Apple tree
As naive as Adam and Eve
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Let's go down to the apple tree
Fighting against gravity
Oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh

Falling too deep
Can you catch me
Falling too deep
Can you catch me
Falling too deep
Can you catch me
Falling too deep ....---Lyrics submitted by Rachael S.
