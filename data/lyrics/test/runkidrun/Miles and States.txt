i'm trying real hard, hard not to care
but i miss you my dear, won't you come back
three weeks and then four no more nights
turning to days to be spent with you

i'll look for nightly phone calls from you
telling me that one day has come and gone
i'll be home soon if you miss me count down the days until my return
i'll be counting too, i always do

i don't know how i'll get through this
but don't worry, i will
your words, they cut right through this
please tell me, you still care

i need you here, only here just for me
you're the one that i love, i can't take it
so close to the end you're almost home now please hurry 'cause
i'll be waiting for you, i always do

i don't know how i'll get through this
but don't worry, i will
your words, they cut right through this
please tell me, you still care

'cause i'm waiting for
your return to come home
i need you more than you could know
and i could never let you go

i don't know how i'll get through this
but don't worry, i will
your words, they cut right through this
please tell me, you still care---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
