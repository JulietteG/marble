Verse:
Time rolls away for the one who waited
She carries me on the edge of breaking
Sweet memories of the one who haunts me
This is a ride on your coat-tails

Was I wrong to be here
To depend on you my dear
Was I wrong to wait for you

Chorus:
Give your love away
No matter what tomorrow brings
I'll be waiting in the daylight
I'll be waiting in the daylight
(2x)

Verse:
I climbed the highest of hills to find you
And it's not the last time I'll fail
'cause there's a devil in the details

Was I wrong to be here
For a landslide
Was I wrong to wait for you

Chorus:
Give your love away
No matter what tomorrow brings
I'll be waiting in the daylight
I'll be waiting in the daylight
(2x)

She had it, she had it
Or so I, or so I
She had it, she had it
Or so I, or so I thought
She had it all
She had it all

Chorus:
Give your love away
No matter what tomorrow brings
I'll be waiting in the daylight
I'll be waiting in the daylight
(2x)

I'll be waiting in the daylight
I'll be waiting in the daylight
I'll be waiting, waiting
I'll be waiting in the daylight

I could use a moment of your time
If I could prove a way that we'd survive
Would you hold on to this my dear
Would you hold on to this my dear---Lyrics submitted by Xyrus.
