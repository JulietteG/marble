You'll have your ups and downs
Don't let them push you out
Cuz time is all you got now
Go make the best of everything you wanna be
With ambition pushing forward
Your dreams upon your shoulders

Though, impossible it seems
It's time to just believe
From here on out you're just getting older
Pick up yourself
You keep getting closer

Let's just get it started
Tonight
All you've ever wanted
Is in your eyes
Just thought i'd take you where you wanna go
Just thought i'd tell you what you wanna know

You've got your destination
Progess and now the man in you
Will see the way you wanted it to be
We've only just begun
There's more that lies in us
Your hesitation's ever long enough

Impossible it seems
It's time to just believe
From here on out
You're just getting older
Pick up yourself
You keep getting closer

Let's just get it started
Tonight
All you've ever wanted 
Is in your eyes
Just thought i'd take you where you wanna go
Just thougt i'd tell you what you wanna know
Let's just get it started 
Tonight
All you've ever wanted
Is in your eyes
Just thought i'd take you where you wanna go
Just thought i'd tell you what you wanna know
Just thought i'd take you where you wanna go

~musical break

The future holds a brighter day for you
Though you may ask yourself tonight
Is it outta reach?
outta reach?
Is it outta reach?
Is it outta reach?
outta reach?
Or am i?
Or am i?
[Let's just get it started]

Let's just get it started
Tonight
All you've ever wanted 
Is in your eyes
Just thought i'd take you where you wanna go
Just thought i'd tell you what you wanna know
Let's just get it started
[Wherever you are]
All you've ever wanted
[It's in your eyes]
Just thought i'd take you where you wanna go
Just thought i'd tell you what you wanna know
Just thought i'd take you where you wanna go---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
