Just see the sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy and cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two
Birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy and cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two
Birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you---
