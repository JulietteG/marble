Obsession it takes control, obsession it eats me whole
I can't say the words out loud, so in a rhyme I wrote you down
Now you'll live through the ages, I can feel your pulse in the pages.
Woah woah

I have written you down now, you will live forever 
and all the world will read you and you will live forever, 
In eyes not yet created, on tongues that are not born, 
I have written you down now, you will live forever.

Your body lies upon the sheets, of paper and words so sweet 
I can't say the words so i wrote you into my verse. 
Now you'll live through the ages, I can feel your pulse in the pages.
Oh woah woah.

I have written you down now, you will live forever
and all the world will read you and you will live forever,
In eyes not yet created on tongues that are not born, 
I have written you down now, you will live forever.

I have read her with these eyes, I have read her with these eyes
I have held her in these hands.
I have written you down now, you will live forever.
The virtues and the verse and you will live forever.

I have written you down now, you will live forever 
and all the world will read you and you will live forever, 
In eyes not yet created, on tongues that are not born, 
I have written you down, you will live forever.
You will live forever.---Lyrics submitted by David Band.
