This is vocal detection 
Front line open intellection 
Outlining all his imperfections 
This is his fucking confession 
Right now you cause that what 
Screaming you want it and more 
Sit down ambassador reference 
Right now your voice is a weapon 
Wake up to stars in the sky 
Watch light revolve with your mind 
Watch all the storms rising 
And put all your palms in the sky 
No more falling to pressure 
No more failing acceptance 
Throw all your hells towards the heavens 
Cuz your voice is a weapon 

And your voice is a weapon 
And we'll do with it what we can 
And your voice is a weapon 
And we'll do with it what we can 
I'll fall into your arms again 
I'll fall into your arms again 
I'll fall into your arms again 
I'll fall into your arms 

We dance with the devils 
And make your halos the color of sinner's portraits 
And smothering it means everything's lovely again 
Nothing's quite as it seems 
Society's all a disease 
Kill all your fear in your sleep 
Cuz everything's formed in a dream 
Breathe in insanity's grip 
Words from insanity's lips 
Falling from sanity's cliff 
Watching your vanity slip 
No more falling to pressure 
No more failing acceptance 
Throw all your hells towards the heavens 
Cuz your voice is a weapon 

And your voice is a weapon 
And we'll do with it what we can 
And your voice is a weapon 
And we'll do with it what we can 
I'll fall into your arms again 
I'll fall into your arms again 
I'll fall into your arms again 
I'll fall into your arms 

Pressure that deepen the cut 
When will the evil erupt? 
Volcanic fever is lost 
That shit will even it out 
Pressure is feeding the dust 
Vengeance is me speaking up 
This is me speaking up 

And your voice is a weapon 
This is vocal confession 
And it's shooting you down, down, down 
And your voice is a weapon 
This is vocal confession 
And we're shooting you down, down, down 
And your voice is a weapon 
And we'll do with it what we can 
And your voice is a weapon 
And we'll do with it what we can 
I'll fall into your arms again 
I'll fall into your arms again 
I'll fall into your arms again 
I'll fall into your arms 

Choose your voice and etch that on your soul 
Make them heard when crowds drown out your cold 
Leave behind your questions, silent thoughts, and mentions 
The wake has so never fall to 
Your voice is a weapon 
So do with it what you can 
Your voice is a weapon 
So do with it what you can 
Leave behind your questions, silent thoughts, and mentions 
Your voice is a weapon 
So do with it what you can---
