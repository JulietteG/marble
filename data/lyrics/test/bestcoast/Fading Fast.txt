This love will be the death of me
And you'll always be a part of me
I see you when I close my eyes
And I wish that I could realize
That this love will be the death of me
And you'll always be a part of me
In dreams, I see you when I cry
I wish that I could realize

I miss you each and everyday
And I know it's just the games we play
I see you when I close my eyes
And I wish that I could realize

I know this love is fading fast
I know that I can't change the past
So get outta my head, get outta my head
Get outta my head, get outta my head

Out of my head

This love will be the death of me
And you'll always be a part of me
In dreams, I see you when I cry
I wish that I could realize---
