The weight of the world
Crashes down on my shoulders
I'm a big girl now
But I don't feel much older

And I think of the end,
It plays my mind all of the time
I wish that I had a friend
Who would just tell me I'm fine
Tell me I'm fine
It's not that bad
And I have no reason to be sad
But I find a way
Almost everyday to stay this way

When will I change

It's not that I want more
It's just that I want what I had before
This feelings they are the pleading
I just don't really get the meaning
Get the meaning
It's not that bad
And I have no reason to be sad
But I find a way
Almost everyday to stay this way

When will I change

Visions of hope, visions of love
More than before I want them to come---
