You only call me when you're all alone
I don't know why I pick up the phone
I guess I'm lonely and you are too
This is the last thing I wanna go through
I wanna go through, through
I wanna go through, through oh oh

It's a mystery, it's a mystery why you ever left
I don't know why, I don't know why I am second best

All that I wanted was a second chance
So I can convince you to take me back
I guess you're gone now, far away from home
I'm just stuck here, confused and alone
Lone, confused and alone, lo-oh-one

It's a mystery, it's a mystery why you ever left
I don't know why, I don't know why I am second best

All of the things I never said run through my head
Run through my head

It's a mystery, it's a mystery why you ever left
I don't know why, I don't know why I am second best---
