I never meant to make you cry I can't pretend
I never told a thousand lies it's not the end
I just want you to know that I think that you are
Heaven sent, heaven sent
Heaven sent, heaven sent

When you were gone I wasn't good I wasn't fine
I woke up in the morning losing my mind
I just want you to know that I think that you are
Heaven sent, heaven sent
Heaven sent, heaven sent

Heaven sent, heaven sent...

You are the one that I adore, that I adore
You are the one that I adore, that I adore
You are the one that I adore, that I adore
You are the one that I adore, that I adore

Heaven sent, heaven sent
Heaven sent, heaven sent---
