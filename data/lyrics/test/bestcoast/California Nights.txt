I stay high all the time just to get by
I climb into the sky
And my eyes, they cry

California nights
Make me feel so happy I could die
But I try to stay alive

I never wanna get so high
That I can't come back down to real life
And look you in the eyes and say
"Baby, you're mine"

Fading back and forth
I fly through my mind
I take the way I've known
But have I really grown?---
