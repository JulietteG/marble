It's always dark at 5 P.M.
And I can't get you out of my head
I stay awake, I stay alone
And I don't even answer my phone

What is life, what is love?
What's the meaning of it all?
Do I even care or is it just that I am so unaware
So unaware

There is a light that I can see
Consumes me until I can't breathe
Do you see me cause I see you
But I don't even have a clue

What is life, what is love?
What's the meaning of it all?
Do I even care or is it just that I am so unaware
So unaware
So unaware

I'll never understand you, never understand you
Never understand you now---
