[Intro]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Its 8 A.M.
This hell Im in
Seems Ive crossed the line again
For being nothing more than who I am

So break my bones
And throw your stones
We all know that life aint fair
But there is more of us
Were everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
We dont have to take this
Back against the wall
We dont have to take this
We can end it all

[Chorus]
All youll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
Til the words dont hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
Youre a bully

Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Think it through
You cant undo
Whenever I see black and blue
I feel the past
I share the bruise

With everyone
Whos come and gone
My head is clear
My voice is strong
Now Im right here to right the wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
We dont have to take this
Back against the wall
We dont have to take this
We can end it all

[Chorus]
All youll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
Til the words dont hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
Youre a bully

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Its 8 A.M.!
The Hell Im in!
Your voice is strong!
Now right the wrong!

[Chorus]
All youll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully.
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely.
Push him to the dirt
Til the words dont hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
Youre a bully

[Repeat Chorus]---
