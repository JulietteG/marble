You make it up as you go along.
Why pretend that you're something that you're not?
I believe in you and always will.
Ever since you told me you're frill inside.
Emotional mood swings soon collide.
Now gather up all your tenacity.
Take my hand 'cause I'm settin' you free.

Who cares?
He's there to stare and
Tell you how to look.
I'm not even sure they know
You by name.
Who cares?
He's there to share what they
Think of you.
Everybody in there plays the
Same fucking games.

[Chorus]
Alright, alright, alright,
You're such an energy.
Alright, alright, alright,
You're such an energy.
Let me see your fire,
Put your fist up in the air.

Alive,
Thats how I want you to feel tonight.
Live,
You're only here once, so do it well.
Find your own way to rise up and
Give 'em hell.
There is no reason to wonder if you
Should go.
Tell them you can't be bottled,
So break your silence and tell them
Who you are.
'Cause they're all witness to a shooting star.

Who cares?
He's there to stare and
Tell you how to look.
I'm not even sure they know
You by name.
Who cares?
He's there to share what they
Think of you.
Everybody in there plays the
Same fucking games.

[Chorus]
Alright, alright, alright,
You're such an energy.
Alright, alright, alright,
You're such an energy.
Let me see your fire,
Put your fist up in the air.

Tell me, are you feeling strong enough?
Tell me, 'cause all eyes are on you now.

Who cares?
He's there to stare and
Tell you how to look.
I'm not even sure they know
You by name.
Who cares?
He's there to share what they
Think of you.
Everybody in there plays the
Same fucking games.

[Chorus]
Alright, alright, alright,
You're such an energy.
Alright, alright, alright,
You're such an energy.
Let me see your fire,
Put your fist up in the air.

You're such an energy.
Woah, you're an energy.
Yeah, you're such an energy.---Lyrics submitted by ashlee.
