I got a mind full of aggravation
I can take it if I just relax
I say a prayer for the motivation
Keep me silent so I stay on track

But there's a monkey on my back
And it don't know how to act
Got me climbing up and down the walls
Now I gotta make a choice
Maybe then I can rejoice
Cause I'm sick of all the same withdrawals

I got a mind full of inspiration
And I ain't living in the past no more

So feast your eyes on the big blue sky
And worry about life from a long black Cadillac
Pay the price, gotta roll those dice
And worry about life from a long black Cadillac
(From a long black Cadillac, Cadillac)

I hear the sirens of redemption
Screaming out like never before
And there's a roadblock in every direction
But I ain't stopping cause I'm in control

And there's a monkey on my back
So I gotta set a trap
Cause I'm sick of all the same withdrawals

I got a mind full of inspiration
And I ain't living in the past no more

So feast your eyes on the big blue sky
And worry about life from a long black Cadillac
Pay the price, gotta roll those dice
And worry about life from a long black Cadillac

Riding high in a long black Cadillac
Riding high in a long black Cadillac
(In a long black Cadillac)

I ain't living in the past no more
I ain't living in the past no more

Straight and long like never before
Straight and long like never before

(One, two, one, two, three)

So feast your eyes on the big blue sky
And worry about life from a long black Cadillac
Pay the price, gotta roll those dice
And worry about life from a long black Cadillac

Feast your eyes on the big blue sky
Ridin' high in a long black Cadillac

Feast your eyes on the big blue sky
Ridin' high in a long black Cadillac

Feast your eyes on the big blue sky
Ridin' high in a long black Cadillac

Feast your eyes on the big blue sky
Ridin' high in a long black Cadillac---
