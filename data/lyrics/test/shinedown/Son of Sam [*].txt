Paint it black and white if you like,
The story's still the same.
A generation built on a lie, that
Every one of us is safe.
Paint it black and white if you like,
If it keeps you sane.
You know the world wont just stay right.
So tell me, who's to blame?

And I will catch you, but who might
Break the fall?

[Chorus]
Goddamn, I might be the son of sam.
The only child of a holy man.
I stand alone for all to see,
'Cause they ain't never seen a war like me.
(Goddamn) Son of sam. [x2]

Burning buildings fall apart.
Send the best, and send their love.
Turn away. Goodbye, goodnight.
Go to sleep, now don't you cry.
Are you afraid your life means less?
Are you concearned you might be next?
It's much too soon for me to tell,
If you're in heaven or in hell.

And I will catch you, but who might
Break the fall?

[Chorus]
Goddamn, I might be the son of sam.
The only child of a holy man.
I stand alone for all to see,
'Cause they ain't never seen a war like me.
(Goddamn) Son of sam. [x2]
(Goddamn)

Your ceiling falling piece by pieces,
Raining down like concrete.
Just surrender, and remember what
You've done to me.
Look now, over your shoulder.
No, it's not over. it's just beginning.
And now light the fire on ending.

[Chorus]
Goddamn, I might be the son of sam.
The only child of a holy man.
I stand alone for all to see,
'Cause they ain't never seen a war like me -

Goddamn, I might be the son of sam.
The only child of a holy man.
I stand alone for all to see,
'Cause they ain't never seen a war like me.

Son of sam. [x2]
'Cause they ain't never seen a war like me.
Son of sam. [x2]
'Cause they ain't never seen a war like me.
Son of sam. [x2]
'Cause they ain't never seen a war like me.
Son of sam. [x2]---Lyrics submitted by ashlee.
