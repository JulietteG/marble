Its in the air 
So get your head right 
Crawling through the sand 
Making noise, crackin dynamite 
And Ive been thinkin bout the past I cant ignore 
Nothing less, nothing more 
Its all the same as before 
Im just feeding my appetite (Im just feeding my appetite) 

Its in the ground 
Underneath 
Tied up, tweaked out 
Inherently 
And Ive been swimming in the new millennium 
Run, run, here I come 
Im just having some fun 
Im just feeding my appetite 

Dont you know I broke the mold 
Like a hammer to a landmine 
You better stick to what you know 
Cause I aint playing just to rewind 

Im comin back 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
To outlast every outcast 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
To outlast every outcast 

Its all around 
But youre in no shape 
Pacing back and forth 
Looking low, feeling out of place 
I been watching every minute like a casualty 
Bona fide misery 
Its no conspiracy 
Im just feeding my appetite (Im just feeding my appetite) 

Dont you know I broke the mold 
Like a hammer to a landmine 
You better stick to what you know 
Cause I aint playing just to rewind 

I got it 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
To outlast every outcast 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
To outlast every outcast 

Don't you know I broke the mold 
Like a hammer to a landmine 
You better stick to what you know 
Cause I aint playing just to rewind 

I got it 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
To outlast every outcast 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
To outlast every outcast 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
To outlast every outcast 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
Im comin back 
To outlast every outcast---
