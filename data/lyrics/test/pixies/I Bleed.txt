As loud as hell
a ringing bell
behind my smile
it shakes my teeth
and all the while
as vampires feed
I bleed

Prithee, my dear,
why are we here
nobody knows
we go to sleep
as breathing flows
my mind secedes
I bleed

There's a place
in the buried west
in a cave
with a house in it
in the clay
the holes of hands
you can place 
a hand in hand
I bleed---Lyrics submitted by Birgit Srensen.
