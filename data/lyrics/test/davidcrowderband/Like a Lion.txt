Verse:
 Let love explode and bring the dead to life
 A love so bold
 To see a revolution somehow.
 Let love explode and bring the dead to life
 A love so bold
 To bring a revolution somehow

Pre- chorus
 Now I'm lost in your freedom
 This world I'll overcome.

Chorus:
 My God is not dead
 He's surely alive
 He's living on the inside
 Roaring like a lion

Verse 2:
 Let hope arise and make the darkness hide
 My faith is dead
 I need a resurrection somehow

Bridge:
 Let Heaven roar and fire fall
 Come shake the ground
 With the sound of revival
 (Repeat however long he does I lost track)---Lyrics submitted by Hannah negley.
