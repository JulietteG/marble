This is her
back in high school
the night I gave her my ring
This is her
in front of my first car,
didn't we have everything

She's leavin'
she's headed out to California. 
By now she's crossin' Oklahoma,
with a sunset in her eyes.

To think that I thought we last forever,
Wishful thinking I guess.
She had her dreams,
that's why I loved her.
But now those dreams are headed west

She's leavin'
this town was just too small to hold her
and I knew better than to stop her
'cause her heart was meant to fly
and that's why,
She's leavin'

she had her dreams
that's why I loved her
now those dreams are headed west for the best

She's leavin'
this town was just too small to hold her
and I knew better than to stop her
'cause her heart was meant to fly
and that's why

She's leavin'
she's headed out to California 
by now she's crossin' Oklahoma
with a sunset in her eyes

Yah, the sunset in her eyes---Lyrics submitted by Felicia.
