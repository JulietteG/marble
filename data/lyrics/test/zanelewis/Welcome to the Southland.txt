Yeah.

Got the Stars in the Bars out in there front yard,
and the old muscle cars on cinder blocks.
When the sun goes down every guy in town can be found in the Wal-mart parkin' lot.
Talkin' bout football, women, and fishin',
little bit a fact and a whole lot of fiction.

Hey welcome to the Southland,
open up a beer can,
crank up the Hank, the Haggard, and Waylon.
Yeah, thats how we do it down home.
Were little bit backwards here in the backwoods,
who cares as long as it feels good.
Yall come back now when you can,
To the Southland.

Like the home grown beans and the pinto beans
and a Sunday afternoon at mom and dads.
screamin' at the tv damn if we'll see Jeff Gordon win a race again.
We love the lord and we slip now and then,
but were saved by the grace. Can i get an Amen.

Yeah.
Welcome to the Southland,
open up a beer can,
crank up the Hank, the Haggard, and Waylon.
Yeah, thats how we do it down home.
Were little bit backwards here in the backwoods,
who cares as long as it feels good.
Yall come back now when you can,
To the Southland.

Well drink a little whiskey,
dance till dawn,
sing a little dixie, home sweet home.
Drink a little whiskey,
dance till dawn,
sing a little dixie.

Welcome to the Southland,
open up a beer can,
crank up the Hank, the Haggard, and Waylon.
Yeah, thats how we do it down home.
Were little bit backwards here in the backwoods,
who cares as long as it feels good.
Yall come back now when you can,
To the Southland.

To the Southland.
To the Southland.

Yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Lizzie.
