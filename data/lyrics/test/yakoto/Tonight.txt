Stay with me tonight
Please don't go tonight
Please don't leave me hanging tonight
I need you tonight

I am here and you're here too
Let's spend the night just me and you
Are you cool (... )see the moon
Shining through the (...)
You that I trust baby
I feel you and I know you feel me too

Stay with me tonight
Please don't go tonight
Please don't leave me hanging tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight

I know it's late and you've got stuff to do
But they are already broken and daily light it's crawling you
My body longs for you 'cause you make it glow
Well make it burn boy let it go
Make me breathe make me leave

Stay with me tonight
Please don't go tonight
Please don't leave me hanging tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight

Stay let it be 'cause
What we have would be complete
Don't play me for my honesty
Cause I just need you here with me

Stay with me tonight
Please don't go tonight
Please don't leave me hanging tonight
I need you tonight

Stay with me tonight
Please don't go tonight
Please don't leave me hanging tonight
I need you tonight
I need you tonight---Lyrics submitted by carmen.
