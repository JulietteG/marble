(Don't hold your breath)

You can't touch me now,
there's no feeling left,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath,
What you did to me boy I can't forget,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath.

I was under your spell for such a long time,
couldn't break the chains,
You played with my heart
tore me apart with all your lies and games,
It took all the strength I had but I 
crawled up on my feet again.
Now your trying to lure me back but
know those days are gone my friend

I loved you so much that I thought someday
that you could change,
but all you brought me was a heart full of pain

You can't touch me now,
there's no feeling left,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath,
What you did to me boy I can't forget,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath,
Don't hold your breath.

I was worried about you,
but you never cared about me (none)
You took my money and I knew that you,
you could kill someone,
I gave you everything when nothing
was ever enough,
You were always jealous over such crazy stuff.

You can't touch me now,
there's no feeling left,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath,
What you did to me boy I can't forget,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath,
Don't hold your breath.

Move on,
Don't look back,
I jumped off a train runnin' off the tracks,
Good as gone, (good as gone)
face the facts, (face the facts)
a bad movie ends and the screen fades to black

What you did to me boy I can't forget,
If you think I'm comin back
(you can't touch me now)

You can't touch me now,
there's no feeling left,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath,
What you did to me boy I can't forget,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath.

You can't touch me now,
there's no feeling left,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath,
What you did to me boy I can't forget,
If you think I'm coming back,
Don't hold your breath.---Lyrics submitted by Caity.
