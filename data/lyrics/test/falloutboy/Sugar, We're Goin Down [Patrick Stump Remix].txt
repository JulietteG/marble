Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to ell you anythin you wanna hear
Cause that's just who I am this week.
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum.
I'm just a notch in your bed post,
But you're just a line in a song.
Drop a heart, break a name,
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

Chorus (2x): We're going dow down in an earlier round,
and sugar we're going down swinging,
I'll be your number one with a bullet,
a loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet
wishing to be the friction in your jeans,
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bed post but you're just a line in a song.
Drop a heart, break a name
we're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

Chorous (2x): We're going down down in an earlier round,
and sugar we're going down swinging,
I'll be your number one with a bullet,
a loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.

down down in an earlier round,
and sugar we're going down swinging,
I'll be your with a bullet,
a loaded god complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And sugar we're going down swinging (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet; (Take aim at myself)
A loaded god complex cock it and pull it.

We're going down, down (Down, down)
Down, down (Down, down)
We're going down,down (Down, down)
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it.

We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself)
And sugar we're gouing down swinging, (Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself)
A loaded god complex cock it, and pull it.---Lyrics submitted by angelica.
