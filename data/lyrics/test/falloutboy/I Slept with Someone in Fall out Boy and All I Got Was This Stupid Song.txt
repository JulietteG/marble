I found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like home
Just so you know you'll never know
That some secrets were meant to be told
But I found the cure to growing older

I'm the first kid to write to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again
And I've got arrogance down to a science
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends now

(Chorus X2)
So douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's oh, so fitting, so fitting
Of the way you are
You can't cover it up
Can't cover it up

Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lips
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped
Back to your family 'cause I know you will be missed
So you can find a safe place, brace yourself

They call kids like us vicious and carved out of stone
But for what we've become we just feel more alone
Always weigh what I've got against what I've left
So progress report: I am missing you to death

(Chorus X2)
Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting
Of the way you are
Can't cover it up
Can't cover it up

Someone old
No one new
Feeling borrowed
Always blue
Someone old
No one new
Feeling borrowed
Always blue
Someone old
No one new
Feeling borrowed
Always blue
Someone old
No one new
Always borrowed
Always you

I found a cure to growing older
I found a cure to growing older

(Chorus X2)
Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting
Of the way you are
Can't cover it up
Can't cover it up---Lyrics submitted by Caitlin.
