Brothers and sisters put this record down
Take my advice, 'cause we are bad news
We will leave you high and dry
It's not worth the hearing you'll lose

It's just past eight and I'm feeling young and reckless
the ribbon on my wrist says do not open before Christmas

We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can't have almost famous friends
Besides we've got such good fashion sense

Brothers and sisters yeah put these words down
Into your notebooks, save lives like these
We're friends that go on your knees
Make them dance like we were shooting their feet

It's just past eight and I'm feeling young and reckless
the ribbon on my wrist says do not open before Christmas

We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can't have almost famous friends
Besides we've got such good fashion sense

We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends

We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can't have almost famous friends
Besides we've got such good fashion sense---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
