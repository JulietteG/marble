It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
Going off too soon
It all ends up in the jungle too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said Id never miss you
But I guess youll never know when the pages are all burned
Going way back home on the fourth of July

Ill be as honest as youll let me
Im just your early morning company
If you get me
You are my favorite what if
You are my best Ill never know

Im fighting to forgive
Just what summer ever meant to you
What did it ever mean to you?

Im sorry I didnt mean any of it
I just got too lonely
In between being wrong and being right
You were my Versailles at night

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
Going off too soon
It all ends up in the jungle too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said Id never miss you
But I guess youll never know when the pages are all burned
Going way back home on the fourth of July

No, were not the the finest persons no we don't stop
Again and again till Im stuck in your head
Head my God don't stop it
Never mind I'll be drowned
And Im the holy water

And all my thoughts of you
They could be all through the room
And now, dont tell me youre crying
Honey, you dont have to lie

Im sorry I didnt mean any of it
I just got too lonely
In between being wrong and being right
You were my Versailles at night

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
Going off too soon
It all ends up in the jungle too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said Id never miss you
But I guess youll never know when the pages are all burned
Going way back home on the fourth of July

I wish Id known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
Im sorry every songs about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
Going off too soon
It all ends up in the jungle too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said Id never miss you
But I guess youll never know when the pages are all burned
Going way back home on the fourth of July---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
