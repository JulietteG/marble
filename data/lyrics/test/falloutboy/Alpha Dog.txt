Clap until you hands hurt, 
Standing ovations or boos
Watch us until we blur, 
Walk off into the sunset
Tell Rock'n'Roll
I'm alone again
I want to picut
The mid west home again
Your time has passed
They say never means never
So the fast dance won't last

But never means forever, 
Never means forever, 

ALPHAdog and oh, oh, OMEGAlomaniac
ALPHAdog and oh, oh, OMEGA-MEGA-lo
Welcome to the new deja vu
I can almost see the wizard
Through the curtains
ALPHAdog and oh, oh, OMEGAlomaniac

We must have the best coast, 
Tell the best jokes, 
Make it hard to look so easy
Doing something so hard

You must see my way
They scream when they look at me
I'm a (I'm a) star
I'm a (I'm a) star
I'm a star
Oh I'm a star

ALPHAdog and oh, OMEGAlomaniac
ALPHAdog and oh OMEGA-MEGA-lo
Welcome to the new deja vu
I can almost see the wizard
Through the curtains
ALPHAdog and oh, OMEGAlomaniac

You're not the first, or the last
But you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter, 
Past his his prime, 
He's in the gutter waving his hand
"I'm just fine"

You're not the first, or the last
But you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter, 
Past his his prime, 
He's in the gutter waving his hand

ALPHAdog and oh, oh, OMEGAlomaniac
ALPHAdog and oh, oh, OMEGA-MEGA-lo
Welcome to the new deja vu
I can almost see the wizard
Through the curtains
ALPHAdog and oh, OMEGAlomaniac---
