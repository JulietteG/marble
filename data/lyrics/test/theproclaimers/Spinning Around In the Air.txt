Let me give praise to your sparkling eyes and your colored hair
Let me spend ages on poetic phrases to show I care
Let me go grazing on dapple green pastures with you the mare
Let me rephrase that, I think theres a better line there
Spinning around in the air

Let me donate something to a kids charity of your choice
For you I would willingly be a worse traitor than William Joyce
If I could sing I would sing you a song in Sam Cookes voice
Let me rephrase that, I think theres a better line there
Spinning around in the air

Are you happy now, say yeah yeah yeah
Are you really happy now, say yeah yeah yeah
Tell me where it hurts
It hurts there and there and there
Adverbs and nouns, juicy and round
Spinning around in the air

Ohh, are you happy now, say yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ohh, are you really happy now, say yeah yeah yeah
Tell me where it hurts
It hurts there and there and there
Adverbs and nouns, juicy and round
Spinning around in the air

Madame Onassis took Garys old glasses and put them on
She said, I see ships and she started to quip about old Boston
I climbed over houses to climb upon you, what did I do wrong
Let me rephrase that, I think theres a better line there
Spinning around in the air ---
