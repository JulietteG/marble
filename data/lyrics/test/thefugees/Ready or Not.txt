Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their four hundred pound mate

If I could rule the world everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course when giddyupin' on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased
But no don't weep

Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinkin' 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad

Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

I play my enemies like a game of chess,
Where I rest, no stress if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless

Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness
Yes, bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew
If you're doo doo, voo doo, I can do what you do

Easy, believe me
Frontin' niggas give me hee-bee-gee-bees
So while you're imitating Al Capone I'll be Nina Simone
And defalcating on your microphone

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly

You can't run away from these styles I got
Oh, baby, hey, baby, 'cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go, my whole crew's gonna know
Oh baby, hey baby, you can't hide from the block, oh no

Ready or not, refugees takin' over
The Buffalo soldier, dread-lock rhasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover now they're under pushin' up flowers

Superfly true lies, do or die, toss me high
Only puff la with my crew from lock high
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Class

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me---
