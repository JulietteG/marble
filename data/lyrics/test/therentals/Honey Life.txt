I don't wanna talk about the world
don't wanna talk about the girl
and I don't wanna sit here endlessly

and there's no need to figure out 
all those reasons you're in doubt
cause you will be in doubt endlessly 

but hey, I just wanna find the way back
to the honey life

and yeah maybe we could change our names
and you could call me rutherford hayes
I just don't know what I'd like to call you

and yes we could write one terrible song
so that no one could sing along 
so we'd have one thing for just you and me now

hey, I just wanna find the way back
to the honey life

[alone at night
I go looking for the honey life
alone, at night...] x2

and yes this world is full of pain
and that pain is on parade
even when every little light parades anyway

hey, I just wanna find the way back
to the honey life

honey
honey life
honey, honey, honey life---Lyrics submitted by Victoria Bayer.
