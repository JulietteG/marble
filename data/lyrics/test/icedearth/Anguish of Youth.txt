The wind's crying softly
Tears stream down her precious cheeks
The last goodbye to those she loves
Before the final sleep
The pain is just too much
She can't even face another day
Oh, the past, it haunts her
The wars won't fade away

(Chorus)
The tragedy still haunts her
The pain she cannot bear
She wants to smile
She wants to live
Free from a life of despair
The tragedy still haunts her
The pain she cannot bear
She wants to laugh
She wants so love
Free from a life of despair

A life of pain and anguish
An empty shell yearns to be free
To break out from this prison
Of flesh and blood, she leaves
Just one more shot of whiskey
To chase the pills that help her sleep
Now she's one step closer
Her quest for inner peace

(Chorus)
The tragedy still haunts her
The pain she cannot bear
She wants to smile
She wants to live
Free from a life of despair
The tragedy still haunts her
The pain she cannot bear
She wants to laugh
She wants so love
Free from a life of despair

The figure stands above her
Upon her lifeless chest he beats
He draws the soul back to her
She now begins to breathe
Awakened from this nightmare
Her body shivers and it shakes
She's forged a new perspective
The scars begin to fade

(Chorus)
The tragedy still haunts her
The pain she cannot bear
She wants to smile
She wants to live
Free from a life of despair
The tragedy still haunts her
The pain she cannot bear
She wants to laugh
She wants so love
Free from a life of despair---Lyrics submitted by sajad sheykhi.
