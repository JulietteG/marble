Do you believe in love? 
Do you believe in destiny? 
True love may come only once in a thousand lifetimes..
I too have loved, they took her from me. 
I prayed for her soul
I prayed for her peace 

When I close my eyes 
I see her face, it comforts me 
When I close my eyes 
Memories cut like a knife 

The blood is the life, and Christ I defy. 
My sworn enemy, birth of a new creed. 

Is this my reward for serving God's own war? 
The blood I've spilled for faith fulfilled. 
To damn her, a disgrace, you spit back in my face. 
I served you loyally, and you spew blasphemy. 

I avenge with darkness, the blood is the life 
The Order of the Dragon, I feed on human life 

I am the Dragon of blood, a relentless prince of pain 
Renouncing God on His throne 
My blood is forever stained 

For true love I shall avenge 
I defy the creed that damned her---Lyrics submitted by vouli.
