There's no place for us to hide
In the neon world outside
So I suppose we'll always meet
In some room above the street

The city lights glow on the shelf
But they can't find a love that lives
Its strange that love could come so sweet
In some room above the street

In some room above the street
Like thieves and beggars when we meet
Awake before the break of day
And like the night we steal away

And I can make it through the hours
I spend with mine and you with yours
'Cause when I close my eyes I see...you
In some room above the street

In some room above the street
Like thieves and beggars when we meet
Awake before the break of day
And like the night we steal away

But if he wants your love tonight
Don't turn away, don't hurt his pride
Close your eyes and think of me
In some room above the street---Lyrics submitted by Victoria.
