I was 16, drivin' my old mans car
The light was red but I ran right through
And I killed a mailbox and some flowers in a yard
'cause I was lookin' at you

I was sittin' in the stands it was the bottom of the ninth
The score was tied 2 to 2
When a foul ball hit me right between the eyes
'cause I was lookin' at you

[Chorus]
Well some people like starin' at the sunset
And some prefer a tropical view
And some like gazin' at the stars and the moon
But I like lookin' at you (woo hoo)

Yeah, some things in this world might have passed me by
And I might have missed a chance or two
But you won't find any regret in my eyes
'cause I'm still lookin at you

[Chorus]

Baby, in my heart I know
There's nothin' as beautiful as you

[Chorus]
