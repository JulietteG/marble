Im in so deepI cant get out
But I want it, to be this way
I expect myself to be a soldier
All lined up, across the border

I wonder why
Cause Ivegot both hands in the fire
Yeah, Ivegot both hands in the fire

Oh no.

I can feel the heatmy fingers melting
The hotter it getsthe more I get used to it
I want to hear the worlds reply
The less I hearthe flames get higher

And, I wonder why
Cause Ivegot both hands in the fire
Yeah, Ivegot both hands in the fire

Oh no.

And Im burning up

Now, Ive watched the men, 
try to dive head first
Theres something about them
Thats got the balls to win

We can talk and talk and cry and cry
We cant sit back, we have tried

And, I wonder why
Cause Ivegot both hands in the fire
Yeah, Ivegot both hands in the fire
I said, Ivegot both hands in the fire
Yeah, Ivegot both hands in the fire

Oh no.

IM BURNING UUUUUUUUUP!!!---Lyrics submitted by Rick Latour.
