The eastern world, it is exploding
Violence flarin' and  bullets loadin'
You're old enough to kill, but not for votin'
You don't believe in war, but what's that gun you're totin'
And even the Jordan River has bodies floatin'

And you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe
We're on the eve
of destruction.

Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say
Can't you feel the fears I'm feelin' today?
If the button is pushed, there's no runnin' away
There'll be no one to save, with the world in a grave
[Take a look around you now, it's bound to scare you now]

When you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe
We're on the eve
of destruction.

Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say
Can't you feel the fears I'm feelin' today?

You may leave here for 4 days in space
But when you return, it's the same old place

The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door neighbor, but don't forget to say grace

And, tell me
Over and over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe
We're on the eve
of destruction.

Well, you don't believe
We're on the eve
of destruction.

Ah, you don't believe

Well, you don't believe

God, you don't believe

Well, you don't believe

Ah, you don't believe

We're on the eve of destruction

No, Noooo

We're on the eve of destruction

ooooh!---Lyrics submitted by Rick Latour.
