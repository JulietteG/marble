I'll come home when I find out where I'm going
I don't even know how I got lost
In a field of muck, from that mescaline dream weavin
Will my knots get tighter at the end
Or will I extend, on to the floor or I will just get trampled

I've been strong on to the floor I am roaming
Better get back down before I fall
I gonna take my time and unravel slow
Til I find which way I'm roamin
I just hope that I don't get caught up
And fall behind, I'm trying to keep loose so I roll right on by

            [Course]
Turn on your flashlight for me, or will I am lost
I can't dream my only hope that I will get out of the dark

Gonna take my time, I'm gonna do it right
Walk in my own, ownly stride
And if, if I fall
Well I'm leaning right on backwards upside down your door
And just take time and know that I'm
Well I get by in through time

            [Course]
Turn on your flashlight for me, or will I am lost
I can't dream my only hope that I will get out of the dark
Although I can't dream, my only hope that I will get out of the dark---Lyrics submitted by Jerry.
