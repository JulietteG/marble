(Puffy Daddy):
Yeah, this right here
Goes out to everyone
That has lost
Someone or that
Truly loved
Check it out

Seems like yesterday
We used
To rock the show
I laced the track
You locked the flow
So far from hangin' on
The block for dough
Notorius
They got to know that
Life ain't always
What it seem to be
Words can't express
What you mean to me
Even though you're gone
We still a team
Thru your family
I'll fulfill your dreams
In the future can't wait
To see if you'll open up
The gates for me
Reminisce
Sometime the night
They took my friend
Try to black it out
But it plays again
When it's real feelings
Hard to conceal
Can't imagine
All the pain I feel
Give anything to hear
Half your breath
I know you still livin'
Your life after death

Chorus (Faith Evans):
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Everytime I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

(We miss you, Big)

(Puffy Daddy):
It's kinda hard
Wit you not around
Know you in heaven
Smilin' down
Watching us
While
We pray for you
Everyday
We pray for you
Till the day
We meet again
In my heart is where
I keep you friend
Memories
Give me the strength
I need to proceed
Strength
I need to believe
My thoughts, Big
I just can't define
Wish I could turn back
The hands of time
Us and the six shop
For new clothes
And kicks
You and me
Takin' flics
Makin' hits
Stages
They receive you on
Still can't believe
You're gone
Give anything to hear
Half your breath
I know you still livin'
Your life after death

(Chorus)

Somebody tell me why

One black morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day

(Chorus)

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day

(Chorus)

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
