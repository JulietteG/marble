Im no more then a friend girl.
I can see that you need more.
My boots are on my feet now.
My bag is by the door.

And the love and the attention.
That you need and ask me for.
Are weakened by my actions .
And lies that I have told.
Im scared to think that Ive abandoned you.
Id like to say that Im a faithful man but it may not be true.

And my heart is like a masons.
Hands of weathered skin.
Each scar makes it harder.
For me to hurt again.
Im scared to think that Ive abandoned you.
Id like to say that Im a faithful man but it may not be true.

Gabriella, the things that I tell ya.
Are all meant to help ya.
Are they working out.
Have I gone, have I gone and failed ya.
Gabriella, have I let you down.

Gabriella, the things that I tell ya.
Are all meant to help ya.
Are they working out.
Have I gone, have I gone and failed ya.
Gabriella, have I let you down.---Lyrics submitted by alexandra.
