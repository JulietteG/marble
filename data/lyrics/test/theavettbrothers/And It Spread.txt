There was light in the room
Then you left and it was through
Then the frost started in
My toes and fingertips

And it spread
And it spread
Into my heart
And it spread
And it spread
Into my heart

Then for I don't know how long
I settled in to doing wrong
And as the wind fills up sails
Came the thought to hurt myself (Come on)

And it spread
And it spread
Into my home
And it spread
And it spread
Into my song
Where there are no lines
Separated the truth from the lies
(Whoa whoa whoa)

Then you came back from space
With a brand new life and a different face
You took my hand and held it up
And shot my arm full of love

And it spread
And it spread
Into the world
And it spread (Oh)
And it spread
Into the world
Where there are no lines
Separated the truth from the lies---Lyrics submitted by Leah.
