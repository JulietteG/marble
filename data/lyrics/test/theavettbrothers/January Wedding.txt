She keeps it simple
And I am thankful for her kind of loving
Cause it's simple
No longer do we wonder if we're together
We're way past that
And I've already asked her

So in January we're getting married

She's talking to me 
With her voice down so low
I barely hear her
But I know what she's saying
I understand because my heart
And hers are the same

And in January we're getting married

And I was sick with heartache
And she was sick like Audrey Hepburn
When I met her
But we would both surrender
True love is not the kind of thing 
You should turn down.
Don't ever turn it down.

I hope that I don't sound too insane
When I say there is darkness all around us
I don't feel weak but I do need sometimes 
For her to protect me and reconnect me
To the beauty that I'm missing

And in January we're getting married

No longer does it matter
What circumstances we were born in
She know which birds are singing
And the names of the trees 
Where they're performing in the morning

And in January we're getting married
Come January let's get married---Lyrics submitted by Leah.
