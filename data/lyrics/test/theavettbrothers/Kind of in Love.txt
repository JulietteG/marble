She's as sweet as the summer time 
And strong as the sunshine 
And I don't want to know her 
I let myself down 

I'm cold as a winter's storm 
I'm soft as a grind stone 
And I can't do a thing 
To flag my life down 

Why do you amaze me? 
Why do you amaze me? 
Why do you fool me into thinkin' that I'm kind of in love with you? 

She's good as a mystery 
A salesman for misery 
And I am bankrupt 
In debt to my knees 

Big brown eyes and curly hair 
I wonder if she sees me stare 
I can't say why I've fallen 
Babe, please have mercy 

Why do you amaze me? 
Why do you amaze me? 
Why do you fool me into thinkin' that I'm kind of in love with you? 

We sink like a ball and chain 
If I knew more than your first name 
Those eyes you got can't fool me 
I know how this goes 

We'd wrap ourselves in conversation 
You tell lies and try my patience 
Bite my tongue in frustration 
Or you slap my face 

Why do you amaze me? 
Why do you amaze me? 
Why do you fool me into thinkin' that I'm kind of in love with you?---Lyrics submitted by Rosy Mixy.
