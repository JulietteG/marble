Baby, I asked you not to keep me waiting...
I told you not to keep me waiting.
Now the afternoon is fading on...

Donna, Bella Donna have you seen me?
Have you ever really seen me?
Like I want for you to see me now...

Lonesome. Like you were when you were sixteen.
When maybe even I weren't listening,
did I help when I was kissing you?

Donna, Bella Donna are you listening?
And were you ever really listening?
Like I want for you to listen now...---Lyrics submitted by Bryana Ervin.
