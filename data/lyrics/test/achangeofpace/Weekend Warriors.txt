Weekends are for the warriors 
all those late night walking through front doors at daybreak
Raise all the glasses high
This one's to all of us sittin around here on Friday night

I remember eighteen hated Mondays
And sittin' and starin' at the clock dyin' to get away
Don't look back and have no regrets
We only got two days and time won't wait for us 

I couldn't ask for a better place to be 

This can't last forever 
Raise a glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than 

This can't last forever 
Raise a glass together 
Doesn't get much better
No better than this

I've been to hell and back
all the snow storms
and the bathroom stalls
Which you pulled me out of

I'll be there
Like you've been there
My word's my bond
Don't stand alone, you can count on me

I couldn't ask for a better place to be 

This can't last forever 
Raise a glass together 
Doesn't get much better
No better than 

This can't last forever 
Raise a glass together
Doesn't get much better 
No better than this

We fight this fight to stay free
And never say, never
If you leave this choice up to me
I'll stay young forever
(Stay young)

This can't last forever 
Raise a glass together
Doesn't get much better 
No better than 

This can't last forever
Raise a glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than

This can't last forever
Raise a glass together
Doesn't get much better 
No better than

This can't last forever 
Raise a glass together
Doesn't get much better 
No better than

This can't last forever
Raise a glass together
Doesn't get much better 
No better than

This can't last forever
Raise a glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than this
