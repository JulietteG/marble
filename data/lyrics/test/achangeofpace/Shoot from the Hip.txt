whoa [x8]

picture perfect 
turned to worthless
bittersweet, the taste is like ash in my mouth
love we had it your a bad habit
I'm ready to give you up, I give up

silly me for thinking
honesty is something 
given free I make the rules
and this is how it ends

[chorus]
heartbreak baby is half the fun
you bring the bullets
I'll bring the guns
take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip and watch you fall [x2]

scenes of passion 
never lasted
your mistakes are too much to put behind
I am tired 
with no desire 
to put together
things that just fall apart

silly me for thinking 
honesty is something 
given free I make the rules 
and this is how it ends 

[chorus]
heartbreak baby is half the fun
you bring the bullets 
I'll bring the guns 
take ten steps now turn and draw 
I shoot from the hip and watch you fall [x2]

then watch you fall!

silly me for thinking 
honesty is something 
given free I make the rules
and this is how it ends

[chorus]
heartbreak baby is half the fun
you bring the bullets 
I'll bring the guns
take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip and watch you fall [x2]---Lyrics submitted by kat.
