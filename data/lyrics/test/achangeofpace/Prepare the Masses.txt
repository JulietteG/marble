Prepare the masses
cause this means war
and if it a fight they want 
we'll bring the hell they're lookin for
with bullets blazing 
the cowards hit the floor
stand up and fight like men 
let God decide who's goin

now sit back and watch the story unfold
of the fair Juliet and her Romeo
two young lovers with one heartbeat
in a devoted grave is where they'll sleep
they are the passion in a city of hate
watching two families quarrel ruining lovers fate
you are the ones who took your children's lives
see your two martyr's dying in loves true light, light

[chorus]
sing me to sleep tonight
sweet Juliet
two star-crossed lovers married
looking for regrets
by daybreak I'll be gone 
and searching for your kiss
leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips

in every war there will be casualties
even family members and best friends bleed
another tally on the body count
so how many more until we're all bled out?
lets not forget about this tale of love
replay the story as it's told to us
life is precious but worth giving away
for ideals of beauty and better days, days

[chorus]
sing me to sleep tonight
sweet Juliet
two star-crossed lovers married
looking for regrets
by daybreak I'll be gone 
and searching for your kiss
leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips

I'm killing cousins revenge I seek
in fair Verona I will lay him down, down to sleep
in desperation, poison becomes
this story's ending in a tomb of 
lovers trust, trust

[chorus]
sing me to sleep tonight
sweet Juliet 
two star-crossed lovers married
looking for regrets
by daybreak I'll be gone 
and searching for your kiss
leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips---Lyrics submitted by kat.
