honestly, with the things i've seen 
it seems as though we fly 
stories go, stories leave 
they imprint on my mind 
be honest, we'll be afraid 
falling, over again 

time is wasted and gone 
life is passing on again 
the white lights leading you on 
is this the end? 

so this is what you want to be 
held too close for eyes to see 
your fantasy, turn to misery 
be honest, but be afraid 
falling, over again 

time is wasted and gone 
life is passing on again 
the white lights leading you on 
is this the end? 

i can't see what's on your mind 
all i know's you're bored again 
In existence you will find 
while you're alive 

time is wasted and gone 
life is passing on again 
the white lights leading you on 
is this the end? 
time is wasted and gone 
life is passing on again 
the white lights leading you on 
is this the end...---Lyrics submitted by jayson.
