Like a shot through my heart set your foot boy
How you spend me down
Show me all the stars in your world boy, circling around
But I can't let go 'cause I want you so
Baby I'mma hold you tight
If you just say so, I'd be falling in your arms tonight
Higher, fly higher
Higher, fly higher
Wanna fly!

Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Walking on air

Only you, you know you know how to make it right
When you came in and taught me what love is all about
Got to be new level
Baby together we can do it better
Speak loud, I got it, you got it
We got it
So, you wanted to know
No need? around, we got today to take down the lights
Promise you to keep it real and know all is right
Higher, fly higher
Higher, fly higher
Wanna fly! fly fly, higher!

Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying

Tonight we're going high!

[Snoop dogg: ]
Mind to mind, eye to eye
Talking, walking in the sky
Yea, yea what a player
Cloud 9 in the air
Elevator, celebrator - this it feels good to me
Love is speed, speed to seed
Heart to heart, you & me - what's it gonna be!
What you wanna do? I just got to find some time and space to be with you
Taste the aroma, all on ya
G is the word, free is the verse -
Blast in the cloud

Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Higher!---
