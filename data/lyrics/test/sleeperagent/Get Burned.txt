I'mma gonna let go.
I'mma gonna waste some time!
Oh my oh my oh my oh!

You'a gonna say so.
You'a try say you're mine!
Oh my oh my oh my oh!

(On and on and on the light goes off, and on and on, and on and oooon)
I'm not cold, I'm just a-shakin' 
And this little of your love, keeps me'a bakin'
Get burned. Imma get burned.

(On and on and on... get burned!)
I'm not cold, I'm just a-shakin'
And this little of your love, keeps me'a bakin'
Get burned. Imma get burned burned burned oh.

Know you better come down.
I'm leavin' you high and dry!
Oh my oh my oh my oh!

I'mma gonna charge you.
You'a gonna pay them fines,
on time time time oh!

(On and on and on the light goes off, and on and on, and on and oooon)
I'm not cold, I'm just a-shakin' 
And this little of your love, keeps me'a bakin'
Get burned. Imma get burned.

(On and on and on... get burned!)
I'm not cold, I'm just a-shakin'
And this little of your love, keeps me'a bakin'
Get burned. Imma get burned burned burned oh.

On and on and on, the light goes off and on and on and on!

(On and on and on, the light goes off and on and on and on!)
Dare you to, but don't you dare.
When you come down I'll be there! When I come down we'll play fair. X2

(On and on and on the light goes off, and on and on, and on and oooon)
I'm not cold, I'm just a-shakin' 
And this little of your love, keeps me'a bakin'
Get burned. Imma get burned.

(On and on and on... get burned!)
I'm not cold, I'm just a-shakin'
And this little of your love, keeps me'a bakin'
Get burned. Imma get burned burned burned oh.

(On and on and on the light goes off and on and on and on)
Imma get burned.
Imma get burned.
