I bottomed out!
Ear to the ground.
You drew the line, I threw in the towel!
Now I feel okay!

(Ah ah ah ah ah ay ay ay ay ah ah)
And when, you're fed. 
You'll flee, from dread.
What's in, your head.
Night lights, in bed.

So sick of shame, such a miserable thing.
Don't wanna think, of the horror it brings.
So gimme love, that big big love.
And I'll feel, okay!

I bottomed out!
Heart gonna pound.
You drew the line and I'm heaven bound!
Oh I just can't wait!

(Ah ah ah ah ah ay ay ay ay ah ah)
And spin, your thread.
Makeshift, cobwebs.
It's in, your head.
It thickens, and spreads.

So sick of me, such a miserable me.
So sick of you, so pleasantly cruel.
So gimme love, that big big love.
And I'll feel the same!

I bottomed ouuuu-t!
