I remember a year ago I was standing in the crowd
Waiting for my chance to break through, my chance to live again.
Now it seems I've found some friends who finally understand
What it takes to make this dream come true, we'll be here till the end.

Shake it, break it, get off your feet,
Come dance with me and don't you fake it.
Shake it, break it, get off your feet,
Get close to me and don't you fake it.

Shout and scream my friends, connect with me and we'll pretend
This night will never end (whao oh) this night will never end.
Just let go you'll see together we'll do anything
This night will never end (whao oh) this night will never end.

Shake it, break it, get off your feet,
Come dance with me and don't you fake it.
Shake it, break it, get off your feet,
Get close to me and don't you fake it.

Oh, wish I could thank you all for what you have done
And all of the things that you have shared with me.
Oh, wish I could take you all to where I must go
Wish I could take you all, I'll take you in my arms.

Dance, get on the floor, shake, get on the floor, break, get on the floor
Dance, get on the floor, shake, get on the floor, break

Shake it, break it, get off your feet,
Come dance with me and don't you fake it.
Shake it, break it, get off your feet,
Get close to me and don't you fake it.

I'm reaching out here to show you what we've been through
I think there's something we can share, that's completely new
Or maybe I'm just insane, whao oh
Shake it, break it, get off your feet---Lyrics submitted by clarisse.
