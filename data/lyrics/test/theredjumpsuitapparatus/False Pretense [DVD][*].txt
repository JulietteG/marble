Oh, it's time to let it go

The world's got a funny way of turning 'round on you
When a friend tries to stab you right in the face
Losing faith in everything I thought I hoped I knew
Don't sweat it, set off false pretense

Betrayed but not gonna be willing to change
And it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betrayed but not gonna be willing to change
Cu-cu-cu-cuz you know...

In sacrifice
False pretense your letting go
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense your letting go

All along you know you thought you got the best of me
You were wrong and I'm laughing right in your face
I cannot believe you claimed you were my family
Don't sweat it - set off false pretense

Betrayed but not gonna be willing to change
And it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betrayed but not gonna be willing to change
Cu-cu-cu-cuz you know...

In sacrifice
False pretense you're letting go
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense you're letting go

Guitar
It's time to let it go

I can't seem to understand it how you turned out to be so cold
You tried but were caught red handed, are you happy with your role?

It's funny to me how you've turned into such a joke...

In sacrifice
False pretense you're letting go
Stop pretending to deny
False pretense you're letting go

So play-ay-ay the game until you run out
And play-ay-ay the game into my head....---Lyrics submitted by Patrick.
