It's 6 a.m., out here again out in the clinic line.
It's freezing cold, you may get told 'come back another time.'
They can help you, but they can't help you for free.

Don't it make you uncomfortable?
Dirty laundry, infected sore.
Rationale ain't sound anymore.

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care, don't give a fuck,
I'll be around, I'll be waiting.
I know, (I know, I know, I know) that nothing's entitled to me.
My health ain't part of your priority.

[Chorus]
Stand in line. (Hey!)
Drill in again, on again, off again, on again, off again.
Miss a pill. (Hey!)
Withdraw again. on again, off again, on again, off again.

Aim for the nerve, that'll hurt just fine.
Malignant, or is it benign?
Go see the doctor, but does the doctor see me?

Once again, I'm still uncomfortable.
A little pain, goes with a little poor.
Guess I'm just not "down" anymore.

[Pre-chorus]
I don't care, don't give a fuck,
I'll be around, I'll be waiting.
I know, (I know, I know, I know) that nothing's entitled to me.
My health ain't part of your priority.

[Chorus]
Stand in line. Hey!
Drill in again, on again, off again, on again, off again.
Miss a pill. Hey!
Withdraw again, on again, off again, on again, off again.

Yeah!

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme this one, that one, this one, that one. [x4]---Lyrics submitted by T.J..
