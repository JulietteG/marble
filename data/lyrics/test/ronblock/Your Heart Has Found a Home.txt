Sometimes life can be so cold
A thousand knocks that bleed the soul
Painful love can close the heart
The key that locks the door

A hidden heart can't feel much pain
A buried rose can't feel the rain
And hidden in that darkened tomb
It withers, never blooms

Chorus:
Calling and calling, the love that's in the Sun
In dying and crying brings hope to everyone
The Spirit in you, you're never alone
And now your heart has found a home

If hurting gets the best of you
Don't fight the dark that brings the dew
Embrace the pain that fills the heart
Remember who you are

Repeat chorus
Repeat chorus---Lyrics submitted by Garrett OBryan.
