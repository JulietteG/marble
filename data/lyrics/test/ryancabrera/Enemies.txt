In the back seat
of a yellow taxi.
Feel your heartbeat.
Deception is intense.
And you think I didn't know?
It's like Bombay 
traffic in my mind.
How can you keep
up with all your lies?
And you think I didn't notice?

I say
Keep your enemies close and your lovers closer.
I'm letting you know the show is over now. 
So lean in closer now.
Keep your hands up somewhere I can see them.
I think its too late.
You got the best of me.
So lean in closer. 

Keep your enemies close and your lovers closer (closer, closer)

And its toxic
but you can't refuse.
The first to volunteer 
to be abused like this.
Don't act like you don't know.
We're in the bedroom 
of your very best friend.
I'm fucking guilty.

I say
Keep your enemies close and your lovers closer.
I'm letting you know the show is over now. 
So lean in closer now.
Keep your hands up somewhere I can see them.
I think its too late.
You got the best of me.
So lean in closer. 
Lean in closer.

Don't say that we're something we're not.
We think too much, then we're gonnna get caught.
Don't say that we're something we're not.
The truth is maybe I wanna get caught.

Keep your enemies close and your lovers closer (get caught, get caught)
(x2)

I say
Keep your enemies close and your lovers closer.
I'm letting you know the show is over now. 
So lean in closer now.
Keep your hands up somewhere I can see them.
I think its too late.
You got the best of me.
So lean in closer. 
Lean in closer.

Keep your enemies close and your lovers closer.---
