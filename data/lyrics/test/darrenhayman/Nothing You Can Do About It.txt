We took our memories
And wrote them down
We got a history that doesn't do us proud
I loved you then, as I love you now
Oh there's nothing you can do about it.

We are trouble
but sometimes smile
We are blood, we are phlegm
We are yellow and black bile
I loved you then, and all the while
Oh there's nothing you can do about it.

The scrabble tiles spelled out ennui
landed on a triple word and scored eighteen
but you cheated by looking in the dictionary.

The house is sealed and double glazed
We've got the thermostat up
yeah the heat has been raised
and we waste our time
blazing through the winter days.

The words they rose
from the page
We forgot to use the ink that doesn't fade
There's nothing left
that I want to say
Oh there's nothing you can do about it.

Getting older
Halfway through
Let's write a list of things we forgot to do
Because you love me
And I love you
Oh there's nothing you can do about it.

You know
The scrabble tiles spelled out ennui
landed on a triple word and scored eighteen
but you cheated by looking in the dictionary

Oh the house is sealed and double glazed
We've got the thermostat up
yeah the heat has been raised
and we waste our time
blazing through the winter days.

Because I love you
and you love me
And there's nothing you can do about it.

 Because I love you
and you love me
And there's nothing you can do about it.---Lyrics submitted by Sam Carpenter.
