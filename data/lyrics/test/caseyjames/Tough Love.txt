They said wed never make it
They said wed never last
They said this love was a hurricane
That would come and go so fast
But baby, were still standing
Were still going strong
So take my hand, dont look back
Were gonna prove that they were wrong

Its just you and me
It dont matter, baby, what they say
Cause we aint listening to them anyway
Gonna make them see
Just keep on making a stand
Gonna show them just how tough love
Show them how tough love can be

I know you get nervous
And I know you get scared
Dont you worry, baby, I aint goin anywhere
Cause I am strong enough to hold you close when times get bad
You are my reason for every dream I ever had

Its just you and me
It dont matter, baby, what they say
Cause we aint listening to them anyway
Gonna make them see
Just keep on making a stand
Gonna show them just how tough love
Show them how tough love can be

They said wed never make it
They said wed never last
They said this love was a hurricane
That would come and go so fast

But its just you and me
And it dont matter, baby, what they say
Cause we aint listening to them anyway
Gonna make them see
Just keep on making a stand
Gonna show them just how tough love
How tough love, how tough love can be---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
