Dont need no farm boy, a big green tractor
You dont need no white beach, some pretty actor
You dont need no dirt road to kick up some dust
You dont need that mud

So get out your boots, old guitars and rusty strings
And let em loose
Throw your head back when you sing
These baby blues
Might not be what you were expecting
But I know what you need
You need some Texas

If a red rose feels like it misses
I will bring you bluebonnet kisses
Baby theres no mystery
What you get is what you see

If somethings missing from what youre getting
I know what you need

So get out your boots, old guitars and rusty strings

And let em loose
Throw your head back when you sing
These baby blues
Might not be what you expected, baby, yeah
Well I come from Texas, let me tell you now.
I know what you need.

If youre not finding what youre after
And you need a long day full of laughter
Baby theres no mystery
I know what you need
Come on home with me

So kick off your boots
Let your hair down while I play and let it loose
Come and see theres more inside these baby blues
They might not be what you were expecting
I know what you need
You need some ooo hoo---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
