Love the way you look in that dress
You got me thinking thoughts in my head
The way your bodys moving slowly to the music
Only leaves me wanting more

So baby, lets dont call it a night
Love the way youre holding me tight
When youre next to me
Theres no place Id rather be
Everything is feeling so right
So baby, lets dont call it a night

Just let that clock tick away
Cause in the morning we can sleep in late
Right now lets spend our time
On what weve got in mind
Ill get up and close the door

Yeah, lets dont call it a night
Love the way youre holding me tight
When youre next to me
Theres no place Id rather be
Everything is feeling so right
Now baby, lets dont call it a night

Well baby, lets dont call it a night
Yeah, love the way youre holding me, holding me tight
When youre next to me
Theres no place Id rather be
Everything is feeling so right
So baby, lets dont call it
No, lets dont call it a night---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
