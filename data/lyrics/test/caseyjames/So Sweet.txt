I used to set my life on cruise control
Days just rolling on
Thought I was doing alright alone
And then I saw your smile
And then you looked my way
Yeah, everything changed and

I dont know how I got by
How I survived life living without you
Know now what I was missing
Cause Ive wanted your kisses since the day that I found you
Now everything makes sense to me
I never knew that love could be so sweet
Well, love could be so sweet

Your love has taken me to a place
A place I wanna be
It gets better with every breath I breathe
And let your loving ways
Yeah, fall on me like rain
Yeah, everyday and

I dont know how I got by
How I survived life living without you
Know now what I was missing
Cause Ive wanted your kisses since the day that I found you
Now everything makes sense to me
I never knew that love could be so sweet

Every time we talk, every time we touch
Yeah, every time I look in your eyes
I see how lucky I am and

I dont know how I got by
How I survived life living without you
Know now what I was missing
Cause Ive wanted your kisses since the day that I found you
Now everything makes sense to me
I never knew that love could be so sweet
Yeah, love could be so sweet
Ooh, love could be so sweet
Well, love could be so, so sweet, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
