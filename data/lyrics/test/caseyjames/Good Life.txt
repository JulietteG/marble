A cup of coffee and a clear head
Jelly over warm cornbread
Feeling ready for whatever the days gonna bring

Old boots, socks are new
Neighbors waving, the sky is blue
I may be almost broke but this feeling is free
No doubt Im right where I belong
No part of this road feels wrong
Yeah, it looks like the good lifes coming on strong

Painted toes and tangled hair
Perfect walk caught my stare
One look I was hooked and I havent let it go
Up ahead half a mile
I stopped in to see that smile
Thank you Lord for that angel watching over me

No doubt Im right where I belong
No part of this road feels wrong
Yeah, it looks like the good lifes coming on strong

Like forgiveness on Sundays
Or syrup and pancakes
Were meant to be
She opens the door and
She jumps in my arms
Yeah, its easy to see

Yeah, no doubt Im right where I belong
No part of this road feels wrong
Yeah, it looks like the good life

Finally my steps are steady and true
And its all because of you
Yeah, it looks like the good lifes coming on strong
The good lifes coming on strong
Well, the good lifes coming on---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
