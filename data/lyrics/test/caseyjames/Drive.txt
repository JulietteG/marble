I dont care if its a highway or a dirty country road
I dont care if Im leaving or coming home
I dont know if its the sound of that tuned-out radio
I dont know if its the smell of that burning smoke
But here I go

Im headed out to nowhere like a bullet from a gun
Putting miles on me and the wheels Im rolling on
Slide over baby and Ill take you for a ride
I just like to drive

Well, I love to feel my worn-out boots stomping on the gas
Love to see your bare feet tapping on the dash
Love to see the hay grass swinging in the breeze
And I love burning up a tank of gasoline
Well, it smells so sweet

Im headed out to nowhere like a bullet from a gun
Putting miles on me and the wheels Im rolling on
Slide over baby and Ill take you for a ride
I just like to drive

Im headed out to nowhere like a bullet from a gun
Putting miles on me and the wheels Im rolling on
Slide over baby and Ill take you for a ride
I just like to drive

Im headed out to nowhere like a bullet from a gun
Putting miles on me and the wheels Im rolling on
Slide over baby and Ill take you for a ride
I just like to drive
Well, I just like to drive
I like to drive
Baby, I just like to drive---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
