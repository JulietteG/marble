Everytime I look around
Seeing a world is _(?)__
Stepping on solid ground
I found His Word and seeked His face
Now things are better
I can see a brand new day
Gotta keep pushing on, gotta keep holding
Continuous love is what I been looking for
See in His Word I found love, Im stonger, Im set free

2X
I dont wanna let go, wont give in
The Word is how I changed my life and I wanna stay in His Word

Take a look inside my life
Didnt do all things right
But the Lord God saved my life
It took some time to make it to this place
With His loving grace I can see a brand new day
Gotta keep pushing on, gotta keep holding
Continuous love is what I been looking for
See in His Word I found love, Im stonger, Im set free

2X
I dont wanna let go, wont give in
The Word is how I changed my life and I wanna stay in His Word

2X
I am stronger now with His loving grace
I can see a brand new day
I am wiser now with His loving grace
I can see a brand new day

4X
I dont wanna let go, wont give in
The Word is how I changed my life and I wanna stay in His Word---Lyrics submitted by Debra.
