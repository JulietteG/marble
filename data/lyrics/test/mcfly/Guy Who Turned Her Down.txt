It hasn't been the best of days,
Since she drove off and left me standing in a haze
Because I've been so out of order 
Yes I have babe 
My new found love showed up and blew her out the water 

And it's so not easy 
(I know she'll say) 
I'm sleazy 
(I love the way) 
You please me 

I can't believe I found 
A girl who turned my life around 
She suddenly 
Came onto me 
Pin me down 
On the ground 
I could have pushed away 
But I didn't know what she'd say 
But I'm glad I'm not the guy who turned her down 

I cut my social life in two 
I quit my city job so I can be here with you 
My friends say I'm a fool in love 
But I'm not babe 
It's worth my while because you're what my dreams are made of 

Cos you look like 
(A beauty queen) 
Sucked in by 
(Your tractor beam) 
You know I 

I can't believe I found 
A girl who turned my life around 
She suddenly 
Came onto me 
Pin me down 
On the ground 
I could have pushed away 
But I didn't know what she'd say 
But I'm glad I'm not the guy who turned her down 

Years go by 
(As the years go by) 
I wonder why 
(I start to wonder why) 
She had come to me 
(Bah da bah bah) 
So glad that she met me 
(Bah da bah bah) 
And life without you baby, just don't know where I would be 

I can't believe I found 
A girl who turned my life around 
She suddenly 
Came onto me 
Pin me down 
On the ground 
I could have pushed away 
But I didn't know what she'd say 
But I'm glad I'm not the guy who turned her down (down down down down) 
Yeah I'm glad I'm not the guy who turned her down (down down down down) 
Yeah I'm glad I'm not the guy who turned her down---Lyrics submitted by Faythe.
