She walked in and said, 
She didn't wanna know anymore. [anymore, anymore}
Before I could ask why,
She was gone out the door. [out the door, out the door}

I didn't know [didn't know, didn't know], what I did wrong [I did wrong, I did wrong],
But now i just can't move on...

Since she left me [she left me], she told me [she told me], don't worry [don't worry],
You'll be okay, you don't need me,
Believe me, you'll be fine.
Then I knew what she meant,
And it's not what she said.
Now I can't believe shes gone.

I tried calling her up on her phone,
No ones there. [no ones there, no ones there]
I left messages after the tone,
[Really? Yeah man loads]

I didn't know [didn't know, didn't know], what I did wrong [I did wrong, I did wrong].
But now I just can't move on...

Since she left me [she left me], she told me [she told me], don't worry [don't worry],
You'll be okay, you don't need me,
Believe me, you'll be fine.
Then I knew what she meant,
And it's not what she said.
Now I can't believe shes gone.

Well, since she left me [she left me], she told me [she told me], don't you worry [don't worry],
You'll be okay, you don't need me,
Believe me, you'll be fine.
Then I knew what she meant,
And it's not what she said.
Now I can't believe shes gone.
