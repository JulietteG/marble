When everything is going wrong and things are just a little strange. 
It's been so long now you've forgotten how to smile. 
And overhead the skies are clear but, it still seems to rain on you. 
And your only friends, all have better things to do. 

When you're down, and lost. 
And you need a helping hand. 
When you're down, and lost along the way.
Oh!
Just tell yourself- I'll
I'll be okay.

When things are only getting worse. 
And you need someone to take the blame.
(Need someone to take the blame)
When your lover's gone there's no one to share the pain. 
You're sleeping with the t.v. on, and you're lying in an empty bed.
(Lying in an empty bed)
All the alcohol in the world would never help me to forget. 

When you're down, and lost.
And you need a helping hand. 
When you're down, and lost along the way, just try a little harder. 
Try your best to make it through the day.
Oh! 
Just tell yourself- I'll,
I'll be okay.

You'e not alone. 
(Youre not alone)
You'e not alone. 
(Youre not alone)
You're not alone. 

Just tell yourself- I'll 
I'll be okay.
Oh!
Just tell yourself- I'll
I'll be okay. 
Won't you tell yourself -I'll be okay.

When you're down, and lost. 
And you need a helping hand. 
When you're down, and lost along the way, try a little harder. 
Try your best to make it through the day and, 
Oh! 
Just tell yourself- I'll
I'll be okay. 

I'll-
I'll be okay.

I'll-
I'll be okay.---Lyrics submitted by alexsis.
