Did the best that I could
Said I'd die for you and I would
But I drowned all those feelings in the flood

Need to know if you're there
If you're listening to my prayers to my tears
Feel like raindrops through the mud

How was I to know that a year ago I'd need to read between the lines
And every lie and that's why

Every time I fall asleep my dreams are haunted
And every time I close my eyes I'm not alone
And every time I cry I'm right back where you wanted
I try to drown you out so down goes another one
 (Down goes another one)
Down goes another one
 (Down goes another one)
Down goes another one
 (Down goes another one)

Living Fast
Dying young
But I'm living with what you've done
Now I face accusations
I won't run
No

I'm starting to remember things that you said
I'm unravelling what they meant
But the world moves on
You're just another one

And how can I go on
'Cause when I'm in the sun I see your shadow on the ground
But you're never there when I turn around

Every time I fall asleep my dreams are haunted
And every time I close my eyes I'm not alone
And every time I cry I'm right back where you wanted
I try to drown you out so down goes another one

And how can I go on
'Cause when I'm in the sun I see your shadow on the ground
(Shadow on the ground)
But you're never there when I turn around

'Cause every time I fall asleep my dreams are haunted
(My dreams are haunted)
And every time I close my eyes I'm not alone
And every time I cry I'm right back where you wanted
(Right back where you wanted)
I try to drown you out so down goes another one
(Hey)
Down goes another one
 (Down goes another one)
Down goes another one
(Hey)
Down goes another one
 (Down goes another one)
Down goes another one
Down goes another one
 (Down goes another one)
Down goes another one
(hey)---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca.
