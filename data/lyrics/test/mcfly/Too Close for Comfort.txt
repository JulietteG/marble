I never meant the things i said to make you cry 
and i say i'm sorry, it's hard to forget
and yes i regret all these mistakes.

I don't know why your leaving me, but i know you must have your reasons
Theres tears in your eyes
I watch as you cry
But its getting late.

Was i invading in on your secrets.
was i to close for comfort 
You're pushing me out when i wanted in
What was i just about to discover
When i got too close for comfort
Driving you home, guess i'll never know.

Remember when we scratched our names into the sand and told me you loved me
But now that i find you've changed your mind, im lost for words

And everything i feel for you i wrote down on one piece of paper
The one in your hand
you won't understand
how much it hurts to let you go

Was i invading in on your secrets
was i to close for comfort
you're pushing me out when i wanted in
what was i just about to discover
when i got too close for comfort
driving you home, guess i'll never know

All this time you've been telling me lies
Hidden in bags that are under your eyes
And when i asked you i knew i was right
But if you turn your back on me now
when i need you most but you chose to let me
down, down, down

Won't you think about what you're about to do to me and back down....

Was i invading in on your secrets
was i too close for comfort
pushing me out when i wanted in
What was i just about to discover 
when i got to close for comfort
you're pushing me out when i wanted in
Yeah, yeah!

Was i invading in on your secrets
was i too close for comfort 
you're psuhing me out when i wanted in
What was i just about to discover
and i got too close for comfort
driving you home..

Guess i'll never know---Lyrics submitted by ashlina.
