Now lets party!

The clock hits twelve when she entered the room,
But if looks could kill, than we all would be doomed.
After just one kiss, youre not able to move.
From her venomous lips, and her poisoned perfume.

She started swaying so sexy and looking at me,
And it got me caught in a mind control.
This place is prison  Im chained up  I give up  Im out of mercy.
She wouldnt let me go.

She said she likes to dance, all by herself, shes a party girl.
She dont care for nobody else, shes in her own world.
I love this little party girl.
I love this little party girl.
Shes such a little party girl.

I- I gotta leave this room, because shes starting to spin,
But theres no escape from this mess that Im in.
She cant resist the temptation of sin,
So put your collar up,
Before she sinks her teeth in, yeah.

She started swaying so sexy and looking at me,
And it got me caught in a mind control.
This place is prison  Im chained up  I give up  Im out of mercy.
She wouldnt let me go.

She likes to dance, all by herself, cause shes a party girl.
She dont care for nobody else, shes in her own world.
I love this little party girl.
I love this little party girl.
Shes such a little party girl.
I love this party girl.

Yeah!
She likes to dance, all by herself, cause shes a party girl.
She dont care for nobody else, shes in her own world.
I love this little party girl.
She likes to dance, all by herself, shes a party girl.
I love this little party girl.
She likes to dance, all by herself, shes a party girl.
Shes such a little party girl.---Lyrics submitted by Nathalie.
