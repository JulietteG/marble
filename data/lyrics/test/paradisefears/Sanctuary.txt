So go ahead and lie to yourself,
And pretend that youre a ray of light,
When youre a broken candle

Youre keeping time with yourself,
When did it all start moving way too fast,
For you to handle

Youre short on breath but heavy on time,
You lost the words but you found the rhyme,
Its all just poetry now

The walls are singing,
Hallelujah amen,
The walls are singing,
Hallelujah amen

Its so dark in the room,
And the ceilings are high,
You know the feeling,
Youve been here before

And its a broken old pew,
And its an echoing cry,
Dont sell yourself short

On breath and heavy on time,
You lost the words but you found the rhyme,
Its all just poetry now

The walls are singing,
Hallelujah amen,
The walls are singing,
Hallelujah amen
[x2]

In time youll find,
This lifes a painting and youre the artist,
So open your eyes,
Its never too late to clear your canvas

So paint me jealous,
Paint me rage,
For Gods sake paint me anything,
Just paint,
Your brush awaits

Hallelujah amen,
The walls sing you to sleep,
Hallelujah amen,
One secret meant to keep you safe tonight,
I swear that everything will be alright ---
