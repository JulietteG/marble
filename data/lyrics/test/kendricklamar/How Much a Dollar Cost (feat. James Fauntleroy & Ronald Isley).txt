How much a dollar really cost? 
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts 
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all 
Gotta see how Im chillin' once I park this luxury car 
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 
20 years ago, can't forget 
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals 
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do 
20 on 6, he didn't hear me 
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu 
My American tongue was slurry 
Walked out the gas station 
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion 
Asked me for ten grand 
Stressin' about dry land 
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open 
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' 
He begged and pleaded 
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it 
Told him, "Beat it" 
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it 
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated 
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you 
Nothin' less, nothin' more 
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

It's more to feed your mind 
Water, sun and love, the one you love 
All you need, the air you breathe 

He's starin' at me in disbelief 
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key 
He's starin' at me, I started my car and tried to leave 
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see 
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him 
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor 
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser 
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious 
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect 
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck 
I never understood someone beggin' for goods 
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could 
And this particular person just had it down pat 
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked 
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14? 
A humble man is all that we ever need 
Tell me how much a dollar cost 

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment 
I never met a transient that demanded attention 
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' 
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different 
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless 
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? 
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies 
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time 
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin' 
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise 
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine 
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin 
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin' 
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal 
Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up 
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus 
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy 
You looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" 
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" 
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free 
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power 
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve 
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost 
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God" 

I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me? 
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be 
Shades of grey will never change if I condone 
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs---
