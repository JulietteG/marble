(feat. Mary J. Blige)

[Kendrick Lamar - Intro]
We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

[Hook]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
Cuz the people that hurt cant understand it
You speakin outlandish, Im ashamed how to make it all work
Another planet, its a short term role for me
I rec its all for me, its just mo with me
And youre here for you too here can re-persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin off, I aint takin off these pistons
Im takin off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much itd cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
Im past that, now pass that
A word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours

[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]
I see myself performing at
Soldout shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammys, winning 5 awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Cant imagine how it feels
Thats why Im smiling every day
Cause my dream aint far away

[Hook]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Youre looking at me and tell me Im blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when Im at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, Im reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
Im a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow Imma take that Ill never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin to you, I was walkin it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello

[Verse 6: Mary J. Blige]
And Im so happy I cry
Cause I cant believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And its so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you play so hard
And youve come so far
And you go, that is the time for you to leave your more
And Im gonna do it
Watch me

[Hook x2]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better ---Lyrics submitted by tay starks.
