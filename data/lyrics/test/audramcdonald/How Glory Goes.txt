Is it Warm?
Is it soft against your face?
Do you feel a kind of race inside the breeze?
Will There be trees?
Is there light?
Does it hover on the ground?
Does it shine from all around, or just from you?
Is it endless and empty and you wander on your own?
Slowly forget about the folks that you have known,
or does risin' bread fill up the air, from open kitchens everywhere?
Familiar faces far as you can see, like a family?

Do we live?
Is it like a little town? 
Do we get to look back down at who we love?
Are we above?
Are we everywhere? Are we anywhere at all?
Do we hear a trumpet call us and we're by your side?
With Awards, will I wished for all the things I should've done?
Longing to finish what i've only just begun.
Or will a shining truth be waiting there, for all the questions everywhere?
In a world of wonderin', suddenly you'll know, and you will always know.

Will my mother be there waitin' for me?
Smilin' like the way she does, and holdin' out her arms?
And she calls my name.
She will hold me just the same.

Only heaven knows how glory goes, what each of us was meant to be.
In the starlight that is what we are.
I can see so far.---Lyrics submitted by Gregory.
