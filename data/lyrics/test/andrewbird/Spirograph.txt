Echos down water wells
Picked up in sacred spirographs
Weekend and Winter's 
Unendable, bendable baby

They buried him next to his first wife
His widow watched from under a visor
Daughter tried to keep her out of the sun
That was blazing
Ohhh
Ohh

And then sun went down
And she went to sleep
She lays her burden down
She don't need to sleep

When they were done 
they went back home to a house 
he built with opposable thumbs
when they were so much younger
Ohhh
Ohh

Five years later she died in a house
All the breath 
that blows all the dust around
It just keeps on sifting

And then sun went down
And she went to sleep
She lays her burden down
She don't need to sleep

Echos down waterwells
Picked up in sacred spirographs
Weekend and Winter's 
Unendable, bendable baby
Unendable, bendable baby---Lyrics submitted by Avery Thomas.
