Secrets told in the pictures on your skin
Hours fade into days that never end
I see myself reflected in your eyes
And I hate the way I'm wearing all these lies

[CHORUS:]

So I let you go
And I watch you leave
And I hold my breath
So you don't hear me scream
When you walk away
But the words are only in my head
It's not what I said
It's what I didn't say

Is she everything you wanted her to be?
Yeah, I bet she never breaks your heart like me
So it's one more night I cover up with you
And I hate myself for what I didn't do

[CHORUS]

Should've known better, now
All I have left is a permanent stain
The only part of you I get to keep forever
To prove I lived this pain

Maybe I was never as smart as I thought
Maybe we can never be as good as we want
Maybe you just didn't need me enough
Maybe we're too clever to be falling in love like this
Like this

Secrets told in the silence of my sin
And I'm the one who loses in the end---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
