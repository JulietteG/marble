You made it
You won it by a landslide
Theres no one else above you
But still you havent found
At purpose
The holy grail that guides you
That beating heart inside you
Is slowly fading out
Cause all you want is someone who wants you

You drown in societys illusion
You cant give a conclusion
You have to make a change
Cause all you want is someone who wants you---Lyrics submitted by Kim Jeuniaux.
