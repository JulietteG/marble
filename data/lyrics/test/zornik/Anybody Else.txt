Remember how you held my hands so tight
Remember how you tears would crash with mine

Is there anybody else? 

Remember how you used to make me smile
Just call me up to talk a while

Is there anybody else? 
Will I ever  find someone like you? 

Remember how we danced in the summer rain
and how you kissed away my pain

Is there anybody else? 
will I ever find somebody else?

Remember  how we used to laugh at loud
Now we cant even talk, we only shout

Is there anybody else? 
Will I ever  find someone like you? 
It all reminds me

Remember how chased away my fears
i closed my eyes, you held me near
Is there anybody else? 


Remember how we used to stay up late
The sparkle in your eye would never fade

Is there anybody else? 
please tell me Im not alone

It all reminds me
of you---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
