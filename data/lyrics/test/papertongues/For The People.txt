I will not let you push me back away
From where the sound attacks the planet's flame
This is not a guessing game, oh no
I will not let you change my name, no go

People fall, towers crumble
Planes get shot, and soldiers fumble
You don't make the moon give off its light
And you ain't even got a dog in the fight
Believe me
Cause you will
Get left be-
hind me
I am the voice above the noise
And we need a rocket so bring in the boys

Chorus:
This one's for the people
Don't lose heart cause things get better
You never know the sequel
Or what might happen if you let it
Let's go to the city
Shining lights that never let it go
I won't let go

I can dance inside the grave watch this
I've been to Hell before today 
Who gives
They cannot keep us in the Earth, oh no
I will not let them bury me, no go

People fall, towers crumble
Planes get shot, and soldiers fumble
They don't make the ocean breathe tonight
And they can't hear the voice coming out of the light
Believe me
Cause you will
Get left be-
hind me
I am your ship 
I am your throne
And I am a tent when the world isn't whole

Chorus repeats 2x

Come on
I won't let go
I won't let go

Let's go to the city
With shining lights that never let it go
I won't let go
I won't let go 
I won't let go
I won't let go---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
