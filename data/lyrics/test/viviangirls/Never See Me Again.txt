I had a really hard time walking down the street,
Knowing you wouldnt walk next to me.
And after all this time to get you out of my head,
Why did you think you'd never see me again?
Why did you think you'd never see me again?
Why did you think you'd never see me again??
It took me so long to finally understand,
that you can't be around.
But now your here again,
This isn't what we planned!
Why did you think you'd never see me again?
Why did you think you'd never see me again?
Why did you think you'd never see me again??
There's so much time left,
since you went away,
now thats okay!
But now your here again,
you take my breath away!
I've had a really hard time getting out of bed,
thinking 'bout all you said.
And after all this time to get you out of my head,
Why did you think you'd never see me again?
Why did you think you'd never see me again?
Why did you think you'd never see me again??
Why did you come here again?!---Lyrics submitted by Celeste.
