Before I start to cry,
just turn and walk on by,
the way baby baby leave today.
Don't make me think about,
what you should've figured out.
Is it true, was it always me and you?
So go away, Dont' Stay.
Baby Baby listen to me when i say,
just go on home,
and leave me all alone,
just turn aroung and say goodbye,
before I start to cry.
Before I start to cry,
just turn and walk on by,
the way baby baby leave today.
Don't make me think about,
what you shouldve figured out,
is it true, was it always me and you?
So go away, Dont Stay.
Baby Baby listen to me when i say,
just go on home,
and leave me all alone,
just turn around and say goodbye,
Before I start to cry.---Lyrics submitted by Cassie.
