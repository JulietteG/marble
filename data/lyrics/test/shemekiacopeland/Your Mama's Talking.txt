Baby when i need your affection it seems like youre never around
When i lay and stare at the ceiling, youre long gone away across town
I dont mind a little frustration but baby enough is enough
Some days i need all your attention, some nights i need that funky stuff

Your mamas talkin, you better listen up
Your mamas talking, youre runnin clean out of luck
Your mamas talking, the times they are tough
Your mamas talkin, i need more than funky stuff

I aint one to keep beggin, ive made my case very clear
You dont pay me no never mind, even when i cry those salty tears
I aint gonna hold it against you, but its time you understand
I got a big strong hunger that take a full time man

Your mamas talkin, you better listen up
Your mamas talking, youre runnin clean out of luck
Your mamas talkin, the times they are tough
Your mamas talkin, i need more than funky stuff

Dont tell me im crazy, dont tell me i need too much
Dont need to expectations i go by the feel i go by the touch

Maybe you can do without it, maybe you can get some on the side
Maybe its me youre tired of, just tell me if our love has died
But dont leave me in limbo, i can find somebody new
I can teach someone to please me, the way you used to do

Your mamas talkin, you better listen up
Your mamas talking, youre runnin clean out of luck
Your mamas talkin, the times they are tough
Your mamas talkin, i need more than funky stuff

Your mamas talkin, your mamas talkin, im talkin, im talkin
Your mamas talkin---Lyrics submitted by Vicki Henry.
