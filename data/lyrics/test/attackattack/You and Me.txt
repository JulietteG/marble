For too long now I have been waiting
Waiting for something just to happen
For too long now I have been thinking
Ive been thinking youve got the answer to
The question is do you feel like youre letting go?
The question is do you feel like youve lost control?

Always waiting
Always faking

You and me arent thinking the same way
And i'm so used to getting my own way
That Im burning us down tonight
And I swear that no one
Is getting out of here alive.

For too long now I have been waiting
Waiting for something just to happen
For too long now I have been thinking
Ive been thinking youve got the answer to
The question is do you feel like youre letting go?
The question is do you feel like youve lost control?

Always waiting
Always faking

You and me arent thinking the same way
And Im so used to getting my own way
That Im burning us down tonight
And I swear that no one
Is getting out of here alive.

You and me arent thinking the same way
And Im so used to getting my own way
That Im burning us down tonight
And I swear that no one
Is getting out of here alive.

This is how it goes,
This is how it goes
(8x)

You and me arent thinking the same way
And Im so used to getting my own way
That Im burning us down tonight
And I swear that no one
Is getting out of here alive.

You and me arent thinking the same way
And Im so used to getting my own way
That Im burning us down tonight
And I swear that no one
Is getting out of here alive.---Lyrics submitted by Nessa.
