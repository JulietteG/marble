Help me to hold on, when life seems overwhelming.
Help me to stay strong, when trials come my way.
Give me courage to know all things work for my good. Everything has a purpose and a plan.
So help me to hold on. Please help me to hold on.
When it seems know way out help me not to doubt.
Increase, Increase my faith
Increase, Increase my faith
(repeat verse)

(Choir)
My faith .. Increase 
Increase my faith
(vamp)
Hold me, Show me, Mold me,   Increase my faith

(Follow lead)
Hold me 
Show me
Mold me---Lyrics submitted by Tony Tennyson.
