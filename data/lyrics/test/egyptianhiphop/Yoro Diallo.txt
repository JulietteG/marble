in the dark there's a storm
in the darklight in my darklight
in between words empty spaces
its on my mind its a coal mine

you are burying my dove in quakes
don't you hesitate to elate
chains are clouds for
skies pour rain it falls

they adore us they abhor us
its in their light theres no heart
in the regions of the free-er
they will always try

you are burying my dove in quakes
dont you hesitate to delay
chains are clouds for
skies pour rain it falls---Lyrics submitted by Oliver Steadman.
