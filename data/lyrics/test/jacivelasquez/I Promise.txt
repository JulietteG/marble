[Verse.1]

Lord, you know my heart
And all my desires
And the secret things
I'll never tell
Lord, you know them well.

Though i may be young,
i see and understand
That at times like sheep
We go astray
And things get out of hand.

[Chorus:]

So I PROMISE to, be true to you
To live my life in purity
As unto you,
Waiting for the day
When i hear you say,

'Here is the one i have created,
JUST FOR YOU.

[Verse.2]

Until then, O Lord
I will be content
Knowing that true love 
will come someday.
it will only come from you,

'Cause i have seen the suffering
that loneliness can cause,
When we choose to give
Our love away 
Without a righteous cause.
