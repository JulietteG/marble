Why do birds suddenly appear 
Everytime you are near? 
Just like me, they long to be 
Close to you... 

Why do stars fall off from the sky 
Everytime you walk by? 
Just like me, they long to be, 
Close to you... 

On the day that you were born 
The angels got together 
And decided to create a dream come true 
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue 

That is why all the girls in town 
Follow you, all around 
Just like me, they long to be 
Close to you... 

Just like me, they long to be 
Close to you.... 

Just like me, they long to be 
Close to you.... 

Aah... 
Close to you....---Lyrics submitted by Jesda.
