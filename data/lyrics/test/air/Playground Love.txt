Im a high school lover, and youre my favorite flavor
Love is all, all my soul
Youre my playground love

Yet my hands are shaking
I feel my body remains, themes no matter, Im on fire
On the playground, love.

Youre the piece of gold the flushes all my soul.
Extra time, on the ground.
Youre my playground love.

Anytime, anyway,
Youre my playground love.---Lyrics submitted by soha.
