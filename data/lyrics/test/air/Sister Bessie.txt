Sister Bessie, don't you say no prayer for me 
A slow boat's gonna lead me where I'm bound 
I'm for to travel far across the distant seas 
My destiny will lead me where I'm bound

Only a child, and with a sweet child's tender heart 
Waiting for someone to call you mine 
How do you keep your faith, when you are always falling, yes, I'm falling 
How do you find a way to keep from crying 

Bessie don't you weep, Bessie don't you moan 
You stole my heart in oh so many ways 
But the woman who stole my soul has taken all I have 
And left me here alone and in a daze 
Bessie don't you weep no more---Lyrics submitted by bug.
