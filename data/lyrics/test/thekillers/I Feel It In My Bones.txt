Dear Santa, 
Im writing you a letter, 
Im sure youve got it all figured out. 
Things havent been easy 
Between me and you, 
I guess that there are things that you cant undo 

Maybe I was naughty once but now Im nice! 

(boy you made the list, you know I checked it twice. Well guess what, YOURE STILL ON IT. HAHAHA) 

And I feel it in my bones 
And I feel it in my bones 

Nights have been restless, 
Pillows and sheets. 
Bet you got it all figured out. 
Sweat like a snowman 
Out in the sun, 
Dreaming that there aint nowhere to run to, baby 
Nowhere to hide. 

Hey, Kringle! 
You mean to say when you were young you never got wild 
Kid, dont you get it, Im gonna make an example out of you 
For every mothers child 

And I feel it in my bones 
(Im coming for you) 
And I feel it in my bones 

Silver bells and reigns 
Tinsel, holly. 
What happened to the rose red cheeks, 
Chimney, big bag presents and all, 
Fat and jolly, 
Tinsel holly. 

And I feel it in my bones 
And I feel it in my bones 
And I feel it in my bones 
And I feel it in my bones---
