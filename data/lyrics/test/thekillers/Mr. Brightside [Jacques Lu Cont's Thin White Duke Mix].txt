I'm coming out of my cage,
And i'm been doing just fine,
Gotta gotta be down,
Because i just want it all,
It started out with a kiss,
how did it end up like this,
it was only a kiss ,it was only a kiss,
Now i'm falling a sleep,
And she's calling a cab,
whlie he's having a smoke,
And she's taking a drag,
Now they're going to bed,
And my stomach is sick,
And it's all in my head,
but she's touching his-chest
Now,he takes off her dress
Now,Let me go.
I just can't look its killing me,
And taking control,
Jealousy,turning sainys into the sea,
swimming with sick lulladies,
choking on your alibis,
but it's just the price i pay,
Destiny is calling me,
open up my eager eyes,
'cause I'm Mr. Brightside
(repeat)
I never,
I never,
I never,
I never,
I never...---Lyrics submitted by stephanie.
