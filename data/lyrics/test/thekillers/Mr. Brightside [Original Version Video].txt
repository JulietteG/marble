I'm coming out of my cage
And Ive been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now Im falling asleep
And shes calling a cab
While hes having a smoke
And shes taking a drag
Now theyre going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And its all in my head
But shes touching his chest
Now, he takes off her dress
Now, letting me go

And I just cant look - it's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Turning through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But its just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
Cause Im Mr Brightside

Im coming out of my cage
And Ive been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now Im falling asleep
And shes calling a cab
While hes having a smoke
And shes taking a drag
Now theyre going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And its all in my head
But shes touching his chest
Now, he takes off her dress
Now, letting me go

'Cause I just cant look - it's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Turning through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But its just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
Cause Im Mr Brightside

I never...
I never...
I never...
I never...---Lyrics submitted by Chriselda.
