I pack my case, I check my face
I look a little bit older, I look a little bit colder
With one deep breath, and one big step
I move a little bit closer, I move a little bit closer

For reasons unknown

I caught my stride, I flew and flied
I know if destiny kind, Ive got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to
and my eyes, they don't see you no more
and my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to 
and my eyes don't recognize you no more

For reasons unknown (X2)

There was an open chair, we sat down in the open chair
I said if destiny kind, Ive got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to
and my eyes, they don't see you no more
and my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to 
and my eyes don't recognize you at all

For reasons unknown (X2)

I said my heart, it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to 
and my eyes don't recognize you no more
and my lips, they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to
and my eyes don't recognize you no more
