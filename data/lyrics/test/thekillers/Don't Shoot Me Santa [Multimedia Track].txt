Oh Santa
Ive been waiting on you
Thats funny kid
Because Ive been coming for you
Oh Santa
Ive been killing just for fun
Well the partys over kid
Because I
Because I got a bullet in my gun
A bullet in your what?

Santas got a bullet in his gun
You know it, Santas got a bullet in his gun

Dont shoot me Santa Claus
Ive been a clean living boy
I promise you
Did every little thing you asked me to
I cant believe the things Im going through

Dont shoot me Santa Claus
Well no one else around believes me
But the children on the block they tease me
I couldnt let them off that easy

Oh Santa
Its been a real hard year
There just aint no gettin around this
Life is hard
But look at me
I turned out alright
Hey Santa
Why dont we talk about it?
Work it out
Believe me
This aint what I wanted
I love all you kids, you know that
Hell, I remember when you were just 10 years old
Playing out there in the desert
Just waiting for a sip of that sweet Mojave rain
In the sweet Mojave rain
The boy was on his own

Dont shoot me Santa Claus
Ive been a clean living boy
I promise you
Did every little thing you asked me to
I cant believe the things Im going through

Hey Santa Claus
Well no one else around believes me
But the children on the block they tease me
I couldnt let them off that easy

They had it coming
So why cant you see?
I couldnt turn my cheek no longer
The sun is going down and Christmas is near
Just look the other way and Ill disappear forever

Woo!

Dont shoot me Santa Claus
Well no one else around believes me
But the children on the street they tease me
I couldnt let them off that easy

Believe me
Santa
