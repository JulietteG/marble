When love calls your name
And whispers you're the one
When all you've ever dreamed
Dances like stars around your heart
And finally I hold the chance
To give you all my love
So what's keeping me away from holding you

CHORUS:
I'm ready to believe
Be strong enough
Give everything I am
And trust in love
My arms long to reach for you
The way I feel
I wish you knew
I'm ready now
I'm ready to believe, Ooooo
I'm ready for love

Only once you will find
A love that is so true
And the way I think of you
You can't imagine
How beautiful it feels
I must find a way to free
The secret I hold near
It's these words you need to hear

CHORUS:
I'm ready to believe
Be strong enough
Give everything I am
And trust in love
My arms long to reach for you
The way I feel
I wish you knew
I'm ready now
I'm ready to believe, Ooooo

I know with you
I could stay forever
Sailing into grace
Here all things are possible
There's no time or space
When I feel you near

CHORUS:
I'm ready to believe
Be strong enough
Give everything I am
And trust in love
My arms long to reach for you
The way I feel
I wish you knew
I'm ready now
I'm ready to believe, Ooooo
Ooooo---Lyrics submitted by Myranda.
