On a bad road with no end 
Aint got no home aint got no friends 
Mouth is dry and the sun is beatin down 
Headin in to another no-name town 
Headin in to another no-name town 

Another day gone by 
And I dont care 
Just another day gone by 
And I dont care 

Spent two days with a dark-eyed senorita 
Another one who tried to save my soul 
But I like sex and margaritas 
And I never do what I am told 
I never do what I am told 

Another day gone by 
And I dont care 
Just another day gone by 
And I dont care 

Ooh yeah 
Sad memories tattooed on my mind 
But its okay Im doing fine 
Im only good at being bad 
And I dont care  I dont care 
(Im just gonna play my guitar) 

Just another day gone by 
And I dont care (ooh) 

Just another day gone by 
And I dont care---
