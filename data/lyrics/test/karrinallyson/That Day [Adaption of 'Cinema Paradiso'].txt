I knew the day I looked into your eyes
I'd lose control of everything I'd clung to,
And yet I gladly gave it all away for you that day...

I thought love's power over me had passed,
the mem'ry of youth that burned too fast,
But there I was in love again, my future was recast...

To give my heart so freely was unwise,
The scars of disappointment were my mask,
And yet I gladly gave it all away for you that day...

I welcomed love, forsaking other ties,
I risked it to gain an unknown prize,
For you had given life to me, you saw through my disguise...

I look back now and wonder at the cost,
Returning to the life in which I'm lost,
And yet I gladly gave it all away for you that day...

I knew the day I looked into your eyes
I'd find love, then lose it anyway,
But love is worth the loss, whatever you must pay.---Lyrics submitted by Tim G.
