oh lord there's a ghost train running through my head,
everynight i hear it serenade the sunset,
oh lord there's a deep blue ocean in my dreams,
calling to me from behind the veil of sleep.

i'm afraid i've lost my way,
afraid i've lost may way,
i set out like a scout,
but i've run out.

oh lord there's a beach tree where i find my shade,
i remember breaking down beneath its sway,
oh lord there's a cascade mountain in my dreams,
calling to me behind the fog of sleep.

and it's always out of reach,
it's always out of reach,
i set out like a scout,
but i've run out.

father mother i burn so true,
my blaze is brighter when near to you,
i smoke and spark without your fuel,
an ember from the heart of you.

sisters brothers i burn for you,
i light the night searching for you,
i signal the sky for you,
an ember from the heart of you.

an ember from the heart of you,
an ember from the heart of you.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
