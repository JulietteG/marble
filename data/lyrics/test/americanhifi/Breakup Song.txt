I cant believe I hung around with you
All this time
You drove me crazy with your ocd 
Girl your out of your mind
Im counting on ufos to beam me up
I just dont know
How long I can take this shit
Im over it girl you gotta go

Its over were over
Just like in crimson and clover
Were sinking and Im thinking
How the hell did we get so stupid
Its the end ex girlfriend
I dont care what you think of me now
So long your gone
This is the break up song

One more thing before you go
Would you please give me my records back
My bloody valentine, the pixies, cheap trick and back in black
You can keep the dog we bought
But you cant go near the standard bar
Dont hang around 
Dont call my friends 
They wont know who you are

Its over were over
Just like in crimson and clover
Were sinking and Im thinking
How the hell did we get so stupid
Its the end ex girlfriend
I dont care what you think of me now
So long your gone
This is the break up song

So long your gone
This is the break up song

Its over were over
Just like in crimson and clover
Were sinking and Im thinking
How the hell did we get so stupid
Its the end ex girlfriend
I dont care what you think of me now
So long your gone
This is the break up song

So long your gone
This is the break up song [x3]
