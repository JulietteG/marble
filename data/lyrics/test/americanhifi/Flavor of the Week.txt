She paints her nails, and she dont know
He's got her best friend on the phone
She'll wash her hair
His dirty clothes, are all he gives to her

And he's got posters on the wall
Of all the girls he wish she was
And he means everything to her

Her boyfriend, he dont know
Anything, about her
He's too stoned, Nintendo
I wish that i could make her see
She's just the flavor of the week

It's Friday night and she's all alone
He's a million miles away
She's dressed to kill, but the TV's on
He's connected to the sound

And he's got pictures on the wall
Of all the girls he's loved before
And she knows all his favorite songs

Her boyfriend, he don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned, Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the week

Yeah

Her boyfriend, he don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned, he's too stoned
He's too stoned, he's too stoned

Her boyfriend, he don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned, Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the week

Yeah she's the flavor of the week
But she makes me week---Lyrics submitted by Ligaya Schneider-Bell.
