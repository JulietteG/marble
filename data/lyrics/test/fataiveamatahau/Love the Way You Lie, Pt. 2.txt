On the first page of our story
the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil
I dont know why Im still surprised
even angels have their wicked schemes
and you take that to new extremes
but youll always be my hero
even though youve lost your mind

[Chorus:]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but thats all right because I like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie

Now theres gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
in this tug of war, youll always win
even when Im right
cause you feed me fables from your hand
with violent words and empty threats
and its sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied

[Chorus]

So maybe Im a masochist
I try to run but I dont wanna ever leave
til the walls are goin up
in smoke with all our memories

[Chorus]

I love the way you lie ---
