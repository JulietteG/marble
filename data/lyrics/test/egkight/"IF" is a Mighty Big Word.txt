"If you were a bee, all you'd do is sting
If you were a bird, I don't believe you'd sing
If you hadn't been bad, you'd still have your good thang

If you were the sky, you'd be cloudy all day
If you were a street, you'd only go one way
If you really loved me, it wouldn't be too late

If is a mighty big word, ain't it baby?
If is a mighty big word, ain't it baby?

If I thought you would ever change, I might stick around
But all you ever do, is let me down!

If I'd thought you'd ever change, I might stick around
But all you ever do, is let me down!

If you were a fish, I would throw you back in
If you were a rooster, I'd be just one of your hens
If you were a real man, you wouldn't have to pretend

If is a mighty big word, ain't it baby?
If is a mighty big word, ain't it baby?"---Lyrics submitted by Peggy Atha.
