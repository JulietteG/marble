I stepped into the river
sank up to my knees in the mud
oh the preacher man took me under
beneath that cleansing flood
there was something 'bout the water
there was power in the blood
For the first time in my life I felt clean

oh, oh, oh, Clean, I felt clean
clean, I felt clean
there was something in the water
but there was power in the blood
for the first time in my life I felt clean

I just could not forget it
it would not let me be
see the past was there to haunt me
it had its chains on me
but then the preacher man took me under
beneath that cleansing flood
for the first time in my life I felt clean

oh,oh,oh clean, I felt clean
clean I felt clean
there was something in the water
but there was power in the blood
for the first time in my life I felt clean

oh the blood of Jesus
oh the blood of Jesus
oh the blood of Jesus
that washes white as snow

clean, I felt clean(X4)---Lyrics submitted by Cate Quigg.
