It was a Sunday, when his phone rang.
I know how busy you have been, I'm just calling to check in.
Heard his voice, I knew then, it happened again.
This one was different. I knew him better.
But the pain's always the same.
Heart of gold to take the blame.
And better days, is losing, its ring.

(Chorus)
If this means something at all.
I know we're not like them. Couldn't be if we tried.
Life on life's terms ain't easy.


Told me the story, all to familiar.
It was a ghost from the past, really thought this one would last.
Baby boy, you deserve so much more.
Hate to see it happen to a friend.
Why do lesser guys win in the end?
Wonder what she had until your gone.
She lost her good one.
Now when it all turned into a mess.
I can see it happen for the best.
Try to keep your chin up to the test.
You just gotta have faith.

(Chorus)
If this means something at all.
I know we're not like them.
Couldn't be if we tried.
Life on life's terms ain't easy, just gotta take it in stride.

And I'm by your side.
You've been by mine.
Through the good and the bad, yeah.
And all those nights when we just drive.
And we felt all alone in the world.
Look out tonight, and we were right.
Look how far we've come and, now is our time.

(Chorus)x2
If this means something at all.
I know we're not like them.
Couldn't be if we tried.
Life on life's terms ain't easy, just gotta take it in stride.---Lyrics submitted by aaron.
