I walk up the staircase and through the door
To find the light has beat me there
It stretched across her hair
And in her eyes and she just smiles
And it's all she needs to say
And I feel fine
All the moments in my life have lead to this

My mouth forfeits my words
Dedication song to her

Will you walk with me
Cause I can't see
Just where I'm meant to be
Replay the scene over and over
And never change a thing
Ohh will you walk with me

She walked down the hallway and through the door
To find the light is waiting there
And its more than I can bare to look away
And I just smile it's all I need to say
To make her see that it's moments just like these
That I need

My mouth forfeits my words
She may not be mine but I'm all hers

Will you walk with me
Cause I can't see
Just where I'm meant to be
Replay the scene over and over
And never change a thing
Ohh will you walk with me

Will you walk with me
Cause I can't see
Just where I'm meant to be
Replay the scene over and over
And never change a thing

Ohh will you walk with me (will you walk)
Cause I can't see just where I'm meant to be (just where I'm meant to be)
Replay the scene (over and over) over and over
And never change a thing
Ohh will you walk with me---Lyrics submitted by benz.
