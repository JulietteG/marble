Verse 1:

It's like hanging by a thread
It's like standing too close to the edge
It's a thousand foot drop
Once you're falling, you never want to stop

Chorus:

I want to feel like that
Floating high on cloud ten
I want to be in love like that
I just want to let go and not look back
I want to fall like that

Verse 2:

Like a breath I can't take
Like driving full speed with no breaks
It's a beautiful pain
You can feel alive running through you veins

Chorus:

I want to feel like that
Floating high on cloud ten
I want to be in love like that
I just want to let go and not look back
I want to fall like 

Bridge:

It's a storm inside that's taking over me
Nowhere to run and hide, I'm in so deep

Chorus:

I want to fall like that
Floating high on cloud ten
I want to be in love like that
I just want to let go and not look back
I want to fall like that
