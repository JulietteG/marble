I was traveling around
With some friends from the south
Who'd all moved away 
Soon as we could get out

Fleeing Confederate closets of pain
Losing the accents we'd learned to disdain
Go to hell Southern bigots and belles

But my friends now are making 
Their plans to return
With all that they'd learned
To the place they were born
And the words they were saying 
Just opened the door
To a love that I'd been trying so long to ignore
A longing so deep and so strong

For my Southern home
No longer to blame 
For the pain that I could have found anywhere.
My southern home
Though I may not return
I reclaim your soft beauty as my own
Southern home

Southern home

Now I live in the west
And I like it a lot
But I'm holding those old Blue Ridge hills in my heart
I can dream of the place that has known me the best
Embrace what I've loved and turn over the rest.
Oh I never will lose you again.

My Southern home
No longer to blame 
For the pain that I could have found anywhere.
My Southern home
Though I may not return
I reclaim your soft beauty as my own
Southern home

Southern home

Southern home---
