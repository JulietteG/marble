You could be my dirty secret (I could be yours)
We could only be a rumor (Never be sure)
You could meet me in the backseat (Late night)
A ticket up in first class (Mile high)

Cause hey baby, baby you got me so, so good
Hey baby, baby, I got it so, so bad

Think youre all about me? But Im all about you
Turn the lights down, let me show you its true
Get a little taste of what Im into
Think youre all about me? But Im all about you, you

I dont want to keep a secret (Let the combo)
This is more than just a little thing (Baby fo sho)
I cant wait until the next time (We meet)
Gotta kiss you in the daylight (Out on the beach)

Cause hey baby, baby you got me so, so good
Hey baby, baby, I got it so, so bad

Think youre all about me? But Im all about you
Turn the lights down, let me show you its true
Get a little taste of what Im into
Think youre all about me? But Im all about you, you

Midnight eyes, oh you came as a surprise
You were right on time
Think youre all about me? But Im all about you (hey, oooh)
Think youre all about me? But Im all about you (hey, oooh)
Think youre all about me? But Im all about you

Think youre all about me? But Im all about you
Turn the lights down, let me show you its true
Get a little taste of what Im into
Think youre all about me? But Im all about you, you---
