Dear Santa,
I live in Hollywood, but it's not like in the movies, where Christmas is always snowy white. On my list, is just one wish,
that it would snow tonight.

When the snow comes down in Tinseltown
You'll be dancing in Hollywood
Slippin and a' sliding and a'sleigh ridin' all over the neighborhood
You'll be rockin' with a stockin' on your head so the cold won't get to you
On Christmas Eve you can believe that wishes do come true

[Chorus]
Ohhh, when the snow comes down
Ohhh, in Tinseltown
On Christmas Eve you will believe
When the snow comes down in Tinseltown

You close your eyes and to your surprise you see the reindeer fly
It's choirs singing fa la la la la
go walking by
Your singing and a' ringing right along with church bells in the air
Its seems so real that you can feel
the snowflakes in your hair

[Chorus]

In the morning when you awake
Your face all shining bright
And when you look outside you see
the palm trees dressed in white!

Dear Santa, thank you, thank you for that perfect Christmas day. Gliding down the streets of Hollywood, in a one horse open
sleigh. 

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus 4x]
