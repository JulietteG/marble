I cry like a baby when I don't get my way
Do you want me?
I won't apologize when I make a mistake
Do you want me?
I got scars on my heart and they won't go away
Looking for someone to take them from me
Everybody knows I'm a little insane
Do you want me?

Oh I try to be normal
I try to put one foot in front of the other
And I feel
You don't even know I'm alive
I open my mouth cause I'm waiting for your love to fall from the sky
And I feel
You think that I'm out of my mind
And maybe your scared to be right
But you'll never know till you get me alone

Do you want me?
I tell it to you straight so we can't get worse
Do you want me?
I want to show you me but first things first
Do you want me?
I'm looking for a saviour to save my soul
All the damage I have done has left a big hole
Everybody knows I just want someone to hold
Do you want me?

Oh I try to be easy
I try to put one foot in back of the other
And I feel
You don't even know i'm alive
I open my mouth cause I'm waiting for your love to fall from the sky
And I feel
You think that I'm out of my mind
And maybe your scared to be right
But you'll never know till you get me alone

You're looking at me strange like you don't know my name (my name)
You're looking at me strange like you don't know my name
You're looking at me strange like it's some kind of phase
You're looking at me strange like you want me to change

And I feel
You don't even know I'm alive
I open my mouth cause I'm waiting for your love to fall from the sky
And I feel
You think that I'm out of my mind
And maybe your scared to be right
But you'll never know till you get me alone

Do you
Do you
Do you want me?
Do you
Do you
Do you want me?
You'll never know till you get me alone

Do you
Do you
Do you want me? [x3]---Lyrics submitted by Aayushi.
