(One in a, one in a, one in a)
(One in a, one in a, one in a)
(One in a, one in a, one in a)
(One in a, one in a, one in a)

You say don't worry about me babe
Promise this is just a phase (so what?)
Should I stand around and wait
While you're living in a haze? (nuh-uh)
I remember how you were
When it was all fresh and new (now what?)
Now when you look at me
Sometimes like you're looking straight through

And so why does it matter when you don't wanna fight it?
Looking like love is, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out, nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know

I'm one in a million (million, million, million)
I'm one in a million (million, million, million)
And you're going down without me
You're wishing you had someone like me
I'm one in a million (million, million, million)

You say, "Don't worry about us babe
I just need a little time" (so what?)
I'm supposed to be okay
When we're nowhere close to fine? (nuh-uh)
I know you've done nothing wrong
But it only makes it worse (you-ooh)
Hurt me more, you don't care
About what you're about to loose

And so why does it matter when you don't wanna fight it?
Looking like love is, yeah, you know that I mind it
Breathing out, nothing, can you see what you're giving?
But I know, but I know

I'm one in a million (million, million, million)
I'm one in a million (million, million, million)
And you're going down without me
You're wishing you had someone like me
I'm one in a million (million, million, million)---
