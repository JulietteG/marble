[Haylie:]
Can you hear them?
They talk about us.

[Hilary:]
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise.

[Haily:]
Can you see them?
See right through them.

[Hillary:]
They have no shield
No Secrets to reveal.

[Chorus:]
[Both:]
It doesn't matter what they say.
In the jealous games people play.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
Our Lips Are Sealed.

[Haily:]
There's a weapon.
Which we must use.

[Hillary:]
In our defense silence.

[Haily:]
Spreading Rumors
So far from true.

[Hillary:]
Dragged up from the underworld.
Just like some precious pearl.

[Chorus]

[Hillary:]
Hush my darlin'.

[Haily:]
Don't you cry.

[Hillary:]
Cryin' angels.

[Haily:]
Forget their lies.

[[Haylie:]
Can you hear them?
They talk about us.

[Hilary:]
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise.

[Haily:]
Can you see them?
See right through them.

[Hillary:]
They have no shield
No Secrets to reveal.
[Chorus:]
[Both:]
It doesn't matter what they say.
In the jealous games people play.
Hey, Hey, Hey.
Our Lips Are Sealed.

Pay no mind to what they say.

[Both:]
It doesn't matter anyway. Hey, Hey, Hey. 

[Repeat:]
Our Lips Are Sealed [3x]---Lyrics submitted by Julian.
