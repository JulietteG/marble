In the woods at night
Oh no, it doesn't seem right
No, no, never go out alone
'Cause it's always happy for a bone

You must be sure to stay away
If you want to live to see another day
You should always be aware
Go challenge faith if you dare

No more forever
Always and never

You never know when it shows
But you'll always know
When it is much too late
It is not looking for a date---Lyrics submitted by cinthia.
