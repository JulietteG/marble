B, for bad I'm obnoxious, as in, a sexist creep
E, for egomaniac, when I feel tired and I just want to sleep
A, for airhead
S, for sucker, you wish, you never had been born
T, stands for terrible, when I'm watching football or downloading porn
BEAST!

[chorus]
Blame god, he is the creator
leave me alone stop being such a drag,
play game now dont be a hater
nag, nag, nag, nag
.....
Please tell me why oh why
you call me a beast when I'm just being a guy,
I'm doing the best I can,
yet you call me a beast when I'm just being a man

B, for Brat I'm pestiferous when I'm teasing and annoying as hell
E, for evil and malodorous, as a pig, when my feet smell,
A, for awful,
S, for sleezebag, when we don't agree
T, stands for tripping out,
just because I forgot our anniversary
BEAST!

B, for bully I'm tedious, I'm never romantic enough
E, for enamored and tenacious, and pretending to be oh so tough
A, for asshole
S, for Slacker, when I forget it's my turn to clean,
T, stands for tosser, when I'm acting like a stupid teen
BEAST!---Lyrics submitted by cinthia.
