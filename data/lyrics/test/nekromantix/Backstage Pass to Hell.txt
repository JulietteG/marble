Nobody knows them
They're always around
Trying so hard to be cool.
But what does it matter
If you wear the right gear
And turn out to be a fool.
[im still I fool X2]

They'll do anything
Whatever it takes
Just as long
As they don't have to pay
I don't feel sorry
For these poor souls
What else can I say

[chorus]
Backstage pass to hell
Enjoy the show
Purgatory V.I.P for free

I'm sure when they die
They'll cut a deal with the devil
Just to get on his list
They'll make him an offer
That not even Satan can resist.---Lyrics submitted by cinthia.
