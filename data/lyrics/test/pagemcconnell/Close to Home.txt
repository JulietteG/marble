If you feel like a spy and your covers been blown
and the companys suddenly bringing you home
and your compass is spinning and youre all alone
but the bosses assure you of your safety zone

Theres a secret society running the show
and the real information has nowhere to go
cause the media moguls are funding campaigns
to ensure that the two party system remains
As discussions arrive they hit too close to home
but the only opinion you got is your own

I know the sun is gonna come out again
We can reason, respect and maybe well understand

Our empirical dynastys flexing its tones
to some countries so humble completely alone
if we question too closely we might just offend
all the two car garages and lawns that we tend

when the wild western wildfires finally come home
and the only perspective you got is your own

I know the sun is gonna come out again
We can reason respect and maybe well understand

When the crooked elections have become the norm
and it turns out that man has created the storm
that is melting the icecaps on earths outer domes
its the greed that surrounds us, its what toppled Rome
but if Shackletons people could find their way home 
then the only excuse that we got is our own

when the wild western wildfires finally come home
and the only perspective we got is our own
as expressions go by and the feelings made known 
then the only respect that you got is your own
