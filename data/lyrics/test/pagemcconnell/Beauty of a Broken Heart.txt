A sad refrain as tears depart
a word remains that I can start
To map the borders of my heart
and change the channels that I chart

Im not complete but feel the heat
as pavement seals me to the street
Immobilized I realized 
misjudged the situations size

Though seasons change and seeds may start
the beauty of a broken heart
cannot be seen but in full view 
the colors can come back to you

A love supreme, an ancient art
a finely tuned piano part
that plays its notes from stop to start
and hinges on a broken heart

Though seasons change and seeds may start
the beauty of a broken heart
cannot be seen but in full view 
the colors can come back to you

Effortlessly gliding down the spiral headed toward the ground
of radiance arriving much too soon
Humbly acknowledging the thoughts inside increase my slide
the grade is what propels me to my room

Though seasons change and seeds may start
the beauty of a broken heart
cannot be seen but in full view 
the colors can come back to you
