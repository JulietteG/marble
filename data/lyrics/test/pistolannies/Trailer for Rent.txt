I left the beans on
I put my jeans on
And drove down to the Jonesville news & times
I said to the man i need to place an add
How much will it be for the four lines
Cause my husbands pissed me off for the last time

Trailer for rent, no down payment
Comes with some hols and dents
Where i got tired of his shit
Call if your interested, trailer for rent

Its been ten years, ten thousand beers
And he's still sittin' right there on the couch
I played the misses and I've done the dishes
Bout time somebody got the hell out
My phone ought to be ringing about now

Cause there's a trailer for rent, no down payment
Comes with some holes and dents where i got tired of his shit
Call if your interested, trailer for rent

There's a trailer for rent(trailer for rent), no down payment(no down payment)
Comes with some holes and dents where i got tired of his shit
You better call if your interested, trailer for rent

Trailer for rent (trailer for rent)
Trailer for rent ---Lyrics submitted by emily valentin.
