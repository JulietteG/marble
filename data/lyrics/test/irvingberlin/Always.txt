Ev'rything went wrong, and the whole day long
I'd feel so blue.
For the longest while, I'd forget to smile
Then I met you.

Now that my blue days have passed,
Now that I've found you at last, 

CHORUS
I'll be loving you, Always,
With a love that's true Always.
When the things you've planned 
Need a helping hand
I will understand Always,  Always.

Days may not be fair, Always,
Thats when I'll be there, Always,
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year, but Always.

Dreams will all come true, growing old with you
And time will fly.
Caring each day more, Than the day before
Till Spring rolls by.

Then when the Springtime has gone,
Then will my love linger on.

CHORUS:
I"ll be loving you, Always......---Lyrics submitted by Cynthia.
