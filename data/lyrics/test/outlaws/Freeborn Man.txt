I was born in the southland
Twenty-some-odd years ago
But I left home for the first time honey
When I was four years old

I'm a Freeborn Man
Home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every foot of backroad
Every mile of railroad track

I got a lady in Cincinatti
A woman in San Antone
I always love the girl next door
Honey every place is home

I'm a Freeborn Man
Home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every foot of backroad
Every mile of railroad track

May not like the way I look
May not like my song
May not like the way I live
You'll love the way I'm gone

I'm a Freeborn Man
Home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every foot of backroad
Every mile of railroad, 
Every mile of railroad,
Every mile of railroad track---Lyrics submitted by Jeff.
