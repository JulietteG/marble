Fair and Tender Ladies       traditional song, exists in many versions.

My daddy was a handsome gambler he had a chain five miles long
On every link a heart did dangle of another maid he'd loved and wronged
He'd tell to you some loving story
He'd make you think he believed them true
But love grows cold as love grows older and fades away like morning dew

I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun refused to shine
Than to live here in  Missouri with your memory always haunting my mind

Come all ye fair and tender ladies take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a summer's morning
First they appear then they're gone again

Come all ye fair and tender ladies take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a summer's morning
First they appear then they're gone again---Lyrics submitted by Bill Strejc.
