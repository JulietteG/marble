There are so many signs the end is now,
Our leader told us so besides,
We follow him blind, to and fro,
Wherever he decides to go,

He speaks, we listen,
We'll see his vision,

He explained so easily,
We are all the missing pieces,
Maybe you'll fit right in too,
Ask yourself, it might be true,

Now join our hands and come along,
The day's about to dawn,
You feel it coming,
On and on the hour's upon you,
Now it won't be long,
You feel it coming,

Now we'll put you in our uniform,
Everyone will be reborn,
Wear us over where your heart is,
Your new life with us has started,

You'll speak,
He'll listen,
We'll see,
His vision,

Join our hands and come along,
The day's about to dawn,
You feel it coming,
On and on the hour's upon you,
Now it won't be long,
You feel it coming,
Sitting on it all alone,
We're on a ticking bomb,
You feel it coming,
On and on the hour's upon you,
Now it won't be long,
You feel it coming,

You feel it coming,
You feel it coming,
You feel it coming,
You feel it coming,
You feel it coming,

Join our hands and come along,
The day's about to dawn,
You feel it coming,
On and on the hour's upon you,
Now it won't be long,
You feel it coming,
Sitting on it all alone,
We're on a ticking bomb,
You feel it coming,
On and on the hour's upon you,
Now it won't be long,
You feel it coming,

You feel it coming,
You feel it coming,
You feel it coming,
You feel it coming,---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
