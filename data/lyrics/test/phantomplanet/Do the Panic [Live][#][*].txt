Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo be do
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo

Guess we're all in trouble, huh?
Black clouds are upon us
It's doomsday on the other side of town.
That boy survived a severed head
When most would just give up for dead, 
So I said: "Al B. don't get so upset."
We all get scared of sticking out our necks
It's expected! 

So panic.
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo be do
So panic.
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo

Come on come on
It's time to lose control! 
Come on come on
Turn off your radio! 
Come on come on
You're gonna feel alright! 
Come on come on
Let's do the panic tonight! 
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo be do
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo

This place is turning upside down, 
And shaking all of our change out, 
And Charlotte's tossing her hair to the hounds
But it's her head they want on the wall
Right next to the screeching owl, 
And I don't like this party or the sound
Of people walking across you when you're down.
And that's it.

So panic.
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo be do
It's satanic.
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo

Come on. Come on
It's time to lose control! 
Come on. Come on
Turn off your radio! 
Come on Come on
Yeah you can bring your friends! 
So we all do the panic again! 

Put your left foot in! 
Now put your other left foot in! 

Are you having trouble getting it down?

Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo be do
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo

Come on. Come on
It's time to lose control! 
Come on. Come on
Turn off your radio! 
Come on Come on
You're gonna feel alright! 
Come on, come on
Let's do the panic tonight! 

Come on, come on
It's time to lose control! 
Come on, come on
Turn off your radio
Come on, come on
Yeah, you can bring your friends! 
Come on, come on
So we all do the panic again

Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo be do
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo

Well come on! 

Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo be do
Ba ba ba, ba ba sha-doo---Lyrics submitted by luke.
