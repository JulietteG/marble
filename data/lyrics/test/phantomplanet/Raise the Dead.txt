Go on and pull yourself up
We climb, we climb, we climb, we climb
Down there they get you, down there
Again and again, forever and ever
Go on and give it a tug
Go on, pull up, I know it's tough
But down there it's deeper than deep
That hole is so steep
And things are heavier

Hear it now, the night is calling us,
Wave your hands and summon the spirits up,
Tonight, tonight, tonight,
We raise the dead! oh, oh,

The dark is plaguing our hearts,
Pumping through us and collecting in our deepest parts,
Well down there it's dripping like tar,
And it's stuck to your arms,
And it's sticking to you too long,
The time is higher than high,
Something lurking in your shadow that keeps trying to hide,
Oh no, we want it alive,
To get out, to get out, to get out of your insides,

Hear it now, the night is calling us,
Wave your hands and summon the spirits up,
Tonight, tonight, tonight,
We raise the dead!Oh,oh,

All our friends have met their ends,
and followed demons tonight,

Go on and pull yourself up, up, up,
Go on, pull up, I know it's tough,
But down there they get you, down there,
Again and again,
Forever and ever,
Hear it now, the night is calling us,
Wave your hands and summon the spirits up,
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight,
We raise the dead!---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
