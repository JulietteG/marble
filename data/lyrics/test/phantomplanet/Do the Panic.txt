Guess we're all in trouble, huh?
Black clouds are up on us,
it's dooms day on the other side of town,
that boy survived a severed head,
when most would just give up for dead,
so I said "Albey, don't get so upset,
we all get scared of sticking out our necks,
it's expected."

so panic,
so panic,

Come on, come on,
It's time to lose control,
Come on, come on,
Turn off your radio,
Come on, come on, 
you're going to feel alright,
Come on, come on,
let's do the panic tonight.

This place is turning upside down,
and shaking all of our change out,
and Charlotte's tossing her head to the hounds,
but it's her head they want on the wall,
right next to the screeching owl,
and I don't like this party or the sound,
or people walking cross you when you're down,
and that's it,

so panic,
it's satanic.

Come on, come on,
It's time to lose control,
Come on, come on,
turn off your radio,
Come on, come on,
Yeah, you can bring your friends,
Come on, come on,
So we all do the panic again,

Put your left foot in,
Now put your other foot in,
Are you having trouble getting it done?

Come on, come on,
It's time to lose control,
Come on, come on,
turn off your radio,
Come on, come on,
you're going to feel alright,
Come on, come on,
let's do the panic tonight,

Come on, come on,
It's time to lose control,
Come on, come on,
turn off your radio,
Come on, come on,
Yeah, you can bring your friends,
Come on, come on,
So we all do the panic again

Oh come on!---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
