Hey!
Arms of the ocean reach out for you,
Rusty pipes,
Can't help calling for you, too,
The brine is finer than wine,
But be careful not to drink too much,
'Cause there are remains,
On the bottom of that cup,

If you fear you've had enough,
Of that salty stuff,
I'm on the beach,
Reading a book,
Lost in a page,
Lost for an age,
I could be your bonfire,
And you could be my ship out at sea,

Look!
I'm not after your charity,
And my dear, I don't,
want you pleased with yourself,
What is that feeling of pride,
When you throw your coin,
in a beggar's cap?
Selfless acts are quite,
selfish when you think,
about 'em like that,
But I've been thinking of you,
And how to improve,
'Cause I'm in a fix,
And your heart is tool,
Help someone who's close,
Could be me, right?
Who knows?
You could be my handout,
And I'd be your good deed for the day,

I want a puzzle I don't have to beat,
A watch I don't have to wind,
I really want to find,
your missing piece,
And make it,
Mine, all mine, all mine,

So If you're hopeless and beat,
Lower than your feet,
Or up to your neck,
Or down on your knees,
In way too deep,
And out of ideas,
I can be your brainchild,
If you promise to take care of me,
I could be your bonfire,
And you could be my ship out at sea,
One more time!
I can be your boyfriend,
And you can pretend not to know me!---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
