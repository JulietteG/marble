Look at me like a crazy fool
Comin' here callin' on you like this
Just like we never said goodbye
I know it's late but your memories
Keeps comin' round
And just wont let me sleep
Just one thing
I'm askin of you
Just one thing that I need

Chorus:

Untill I fall in love again
If you hold me in your arms
'Coz the nights can be so long
Spending them alone
I need you to hold me
When I cry
If you hold these lonely times
'Coz every now and then
Untill I fall in love again

Don't get me wrong, try to understand
'Coz times like this I just need a friend
That's what you've always been to me
Though our love is come and go
Would you mind if I live on you till I'm strong
Here I am with my heart in my hand
Beggin' you to help me hold on....

(Repeat Chorus)

Every now and then
Untill I fall in love again.....---Lyrics submitted by Ellakim.
