Shut Up And Give Me Whatever You Got
Shut Up And Give Me Whatever You Got

I'm trying....

Oh yes my mind is playing tricks on me
It's the same as it's always been
Seeing things out the corner of my eye
Well are you gonna be my guy
Oooh dooo waiting for a session and now we feel pressure
Oooh dooo get some for the rest cause you'll never learn your lesson

You like it a lot
Shut Up And Give Me Whatever You Got
I'm tired of waiting
Baby can't you take it
Oh baby you're falling apart
Falling in love while i'm breaking your heart
Oh can't you take this crazy love darling

I'm trying....

Oh yes my heart is blowing hot and cold
Sending lightning into my soul
Seeing things out the corner of my eye
So are you gonna be my guy
Oooh dooo waiting for a session and now we feel pressure
Oooh dooo get some for the rest cause you'll never learn your lesson

You like it a lot
Shut Up And Give Me Whatever You Got
I'm tired of waiting
Baby can't you take it
Oh baby you're falling apart
Falling in love while i'm breaking your heart
Oh can't you take this crazy love darling

I'm trying.... oh darling, i'm trying

Turn it up
Turn it up
Show the girls what you got
To the right, to the left
Is that that best that i'm gonna get

[break]

Shut Up And Give Me Whatever You Got

You like it a lot
Shut Up And Give Me Whatever You Got
I'm tired of waiting
Baby can't you take it
Oh baby you're falling apart
Falling in love while i'm breaking your heart
Oh can't you take this crazy love darling

You like it a lot
Shut Up And Give Me Whatever You Got
I'm tired of waiting
Baby can't you take it
Oh baby you're falling apart
Falling in love while i'm breaking your heart
Oh can't you take this crazy love darling

I'm trying.... oh darling, i'm trying
