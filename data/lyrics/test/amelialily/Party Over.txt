Dont give a 
What you heard, what you heard
Right turns, wrong turns
We living for the whole world, whole world

Ooh la la la
Yeah we jumpin on clouds
And we dance in the rain
Ooh la la la
When my world is on fire
I dance with the flames
Ooh la la la, la, la, la, la la la la la
Heres to everything, heres to everything

Here we go like satellites
Chasing stars till we are blind
Still we grow, we ignite
Put your hand inna the sky
Put your hand inna the air
Ooh la la la, la, la, la, la la la la la
Put your hand inna the air
Heres to everything, heres to everything

Cloud 9, cloud 9
We shining like fireflies, fireflies
On a rise, on a rise
We moving at the speed of light, speed of light
De de de de dum, de de de dum dum
If you wanna come, you better run, run
On a rise, on a rise
We moving at the speed of light, speed of light

Here we go like satellites
Chasing stars till we are blind
Still we grow, we ignite
Put your hand inna the sky
Put your hand inna the air
Ooh la la la, la, la, la, la la la la la
Put your hand inna the air
Heres to everything, heres to everything

Ooh la la la
Yeah we jumpin on clouds
And we dance in the rain
Ooh la la la
When my world is on fire
I dance with the flames
Ooh la la la, la, la, la, la la la la la
Heres to everything, heres to everything

Here we go like satellites
Chasing stars till we are blind
Still we grow, we ignite
Put your hand inna the sky
Put your hand inna the air
Ooh la la la, la, la, la, la la la la la
Put your hand inna the air
Heres to everything, heres to everything

Here we go like satellites
Chasing stars till we are blind
Still we grow, we ignite
Put your hand inna the sky
Put your hand inna the air
Ooh la la la, la, la, la, la la la la la
Put your hand inna the air
Heres to everything, heres to everything---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
