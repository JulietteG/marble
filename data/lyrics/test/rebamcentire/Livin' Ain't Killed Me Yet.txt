Life will throw you a curve ball
Back against a brick wall
Push you right up to the edge
It'll hit you from your blind side
Kick you in the backside
Barely even break a sweat

It's a roll with the punches
Funny little life we lead
Oh, but I'm in it for the long haul
Win, lose or draw, y'all
It won't get the best of me

Cause I been down to the wire
With my feet to the fire
But this livin' ain't killed me yet
Well I been tested and tried
But I still got some fight
No, this livin' ain't killed me,
Livin' ain't killed me yet

I won't let a couple mistakes
Wrong turns that I've made
Be a noose around my neck
Hurt will hurt if you let it
Unless you just forget it
Shake it off, and say what's next

It's an up down, spin around
crazy kinda world we're in, oh yeah
But I'm in it for the long haul, win, lose or draw
Might fall, but I'll get up again

Cause I been down to the wire
With my feet to the wire
But this livin' ain't killed me yet
Well I been tested and tried
But I still got some fight
No, this livin' ain't killed me,
Livin' ain't killed me yet

Oh, I'm in it for the long haul
Win, lose or draw
As long as I've got air to breathe
Ah, it won't get the best of me!

Cause I been down to the wire
With my feet to the fire
But this livin' ain't killed me yet
I been tested and tried
But I still got some fight
No, this livin' ain't killed me,
Livin' ain't killed me,
livin' ain't killed me oh oh oh yet
Nawww yet.---
