You count em one, two, three
You look so cute when you get that mad (get that mad)
You drain the life from me and it feels oh so good

The looks you give are so contagious
The way we move is so outrageous
Just let me in wasting time
Just let me in (lets make it right)

So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down, yeah get down
Let's make it happen all night

You're moving close, my pulse is racing
We're getting close, yeah I can taste it
I've never done it quite like this
So slow it down now, just slow it down

The looks you give are so contagious
The way we move is so outrageous
Just let me in wasting time
Just let me in (let me in)

So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down, yeah get down
Let's make it happen all night

Reach out touch someone
So catch me if you can
Reach out touch someone
Touch someone (touch me)

Reach out touch someone
So catch me if you can
Reach out touch someone
Touch someone, Just touch

Reach out touch someone
So catch me if you can
Reach out touch someone
Touch someone, touch 

Stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
Get down, get down
Let's make it happen all night---Lyrics submitted by Ivy.
