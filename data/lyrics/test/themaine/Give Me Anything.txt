The boys they have their eyes all over you,
And you're loving every second of attention.
I need to find just some way to get through,
Or at least some way that I can mention.

I'm feeling you,
You're feeling me,
What exactly is holding us back?
Im feeling you.
Are you feeling me? (Just give something, give me, give me, give me anything.)

Oh its you and its true.
Youre electric, I cant get over it. (X2)
I cant get over it.

You're running through my veins you feel like a freight train,
I'm trying everything to keep my hands off of you.
Just give me something,
Please just give me anything,
Cause I want you.

And oh no,
I think I lost myself in your deep blue eyes,
And oh no,
I think it's time we cut to the chase tonight.

Oh it's you,And it's true,
You're electric I can't get over it (x2)							               I cant get over it.
I'm feeling you,
You're feeling me,
What exactly is holding us back?
Im feeling you.
Are you feeling me? (x2)
Oh its you and its true.
Youre electric, I cant get over it. (x2)

I'm feeling you,
You're feeling me,
What exactly is holding us back?
Im feeling you.
Are you feeling me?---Lyrics submitted by Mason.
