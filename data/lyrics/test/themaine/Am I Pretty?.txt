You think I'm ugly
(Don't you?)
And I know you hate my body
If you don't like just what I do
Do what you like
So maybe then you'll want me
Maybe then you'll want me

Am I pretty?
Do people like me yet?
Is there a party?
Am I invited?
It's such a pity?
No one adores me yet
So make me up in a shade that fits me
Tell me love oh "Am I pretty?"

You make me feel like (like, like, like)
Confetti for the gathering
So I'll get used
To getting used
I'll do that for you
So maybe then you'll have me
Maybe then you'll have me

Am I pretty?
Do people like me yet?
Is there a party?
Am I invited?
It's such a pity?
No one adores me yet
So make me up in a shade that fits me
Tell me love oh "Am I pretty?"
oh "Am I pretty?"
yeah "Am I pretty?"

There's beauty and grace in the flaws of your face
All candor and style in the crook of your smile
There's beauty and grace in the flaws of your face
All candor and style

Am I pretty?
Do people like me yet?
Is there a party?
Am I invited?
It's such a pity?
No one adores me yet
So make me up in a shade that fits me
Tell me love oh "Am I pretty?"
yeah "Am I pretty?"
oh "Am I pretty?"
"Am I pretty?"
oh "Am I pretty?"---
