Oh a good man said 
If you're feeling dead
You gotta try to find a way to be alive
This is not a game that you have to play 
Don't need a reason to breathe just like you're dying

Give me thunder
Give me lightning
And I will give you every part of me
Take me dancing
Get me fucked up
And play that old guitar and we will sing

Oh my old man said
You must die in your bed
The way you make it 
No one can make it like you do
Oh you're not alone
You still have a home
No matter what you do my son I'm still proud of you
That's right 

Give me thunder
Give me lightning
And I will give you every part of me
Take me dancing
Get me fucked up
And play that old guitar and we will sing

Yeah, we'll sing

Give me thunder
Give me lightning 
And I will give you every part of me
Take me dancing
Get me fucked up
And play that old guitar and we will sing

Yeah, we'll sing, yeah

We'll sing

Yeah!
All right!
Yeah!
Yeah we'll do it. 
Woo hoo
Woooooo eh!
Yeah baby!

Yooooou!---Lyrics submitted by Emma Donald.
