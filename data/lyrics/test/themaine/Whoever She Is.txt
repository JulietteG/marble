I thought I had my girl but she ran away
My car got stolen and I'm gonna be late
For work this week, make that the fourth day straight
But I'm fine with it (you don't have to worry)
I thought I had it all but I gave it away
I quit that old job and now I'm doing okay
Those material things, they can't get in my way
'Cause I'm over it

But where ever she may be
She could be money, cars, fear of the dark
Your best friends or just strangers in bars
Whoever she is, whoever she may be
One things for sure, 
You don't have to worry (you don't have to worry)

And this is the part
Where you find out who you are
And these are your friends
Those who've been there from the start
So to hell with the bad news
Dirt on your new shoes
It rained all of May 'til the month of June

But wherever she may be
She could be money, cars, fear of the dark
Your best friends or just strangers in bars
Whoever she is, whoever she may be
One things for sure, 
You don't have to worry

And every day in every way
Oh, she will look the same
And every care you used to have
Just seems to float away
And every day in every way
Oh, she will look the same
And every care you used to have
Just seems to float away

To hell with the new shit
And whether or not you think you fit in

She could be money, cars, fear of the dark
Your best friends or just strangers in bars
Whoever she is, whoever she may be
One things for sure, 
You don't have to worry
She could be rainy days, minimum wage
A book that ends with no last page
Who ever she is, who ever she may be
One things for sure, 
You don't have to worry---Lyrics submitted by Morgan.
