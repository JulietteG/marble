Take me to the water
Wash away my sins
Bring me to the valley
To where this all began

In the end, oh in the end
In the end, oh in the end
Will you sink or swim?
Will you sink or swim?

Always the children
They call him pioneer
Always to the children
The waters clear

Oh in the end, oh in the end
Oh in the end, oh in the end
Will you sink or swim?
Will you sink or swim?

In the end, oh in the end
In the end, oh in the end
Will you sink or swim?
Will you sink or swim?

Take me to the water
Oh-woooah
Take me to the water
Oh-woooah
Wash away my sins
Oh-woooah
Wash away my sins
Oh-woooah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
