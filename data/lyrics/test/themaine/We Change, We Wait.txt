Oh, I've been Changing,
Your still Waiting on me.
Just wait for me,

I am on my own,
But it's nice to see you came alone,
And this might sound wrong,
But I can only tell you through a song,

And I will take my time,
Cause it's the only thing that's on my side.
And this can't be real,
Tell me do you ever feel?
Do you ever feel,
Do you ever feel,
Do you ever feel,
Do you ever feel,

Oh,
I've been changing,
You're still waiting on me,
Never let go,
Never let go,
She said I'll never grow up,

Oh yea,
I've been changing,
You're still waiting on me.
Never let go,
Never let go
She said I'll never grow up.

Two years now since I met you,
And I just can't forget about you,
You don't know what you do to me,
Oh you don't know what you're doing to me,
And baby I'm not lost,
I'm just a little confused on what to do,
And it's all on me,
Oh it's not you why can't you see,
Do you ever feel,
Do you ever feel,
Do you ever feel,
Do you ever feel,

Oh,
I've been changing,
You're still waiting on me,
Never let go,
Never let go,
She said I'll never grow up,

Oh yea,
I've been changing,
You're still waiting on me.
Never let go,
Never let go
She said I'll never grow up.

Who are you now? 
(Who are you now?)
Who are you now?
(Who are you now?)
This shit is so played out,
It's so played out,
So played out,

Yea I've been Changing,
Your still Waiting on me,
Pleas wait for me,

Oh,
I've been changing,
You're still waiting on me,
Never let go,
Never let go,
She said I'll never grow up,---Lyrics submitted by Miranda.
