I'm on a trip
I cant get off
cant get over
i want it all
i want it all inside of you
i call you up
youre getting off 
im coming over
youre 21
i see your eyes
youre barely sober
i hear your voice
youre calling out
from me to you
i pour a drink 
youre movin quick
youre movin forward

then you said...
No whoaaaaaaa 
im never gonna be inside of you
and i said...
no whoaaaaaa
im never gonna see inside of you
because i kno im gonna fall
and youll be waitin for it all
because i kno i kno i kno
i cant get inside of you
inside of you

this fragile game
its like a train
thats headed nowhere
it never stops 
and i cant see the exit sign
were headed north
i see the cliff were gettin closer
dont say that you just wanna run away
replay all the things that i tried to say
im 21 so youre getting off im coming over

then you said...
no whoaaaaa
im never gonna be inside of you
and i said...
no whoaaaa
im never gonna see inside of you
because i kno im gonna fall
and youll be waitin for it all
because i kno i kno i kno
i cant get inside of you
inside of you

im on a trip
i cant get off
i cant get over
i want it all
i want it all
inside of you
i call you up
youre gettting off 
im coming over

no whoaaaaaa
im never gonna be inside of you
and i said...
no whoaaaaa
im never gonna see inside of you
because i kno im gonna fall
and youll be waitin for it all
because i kno i kno i kno
i cant get inside of you
i kno im gonna fall 
and youll be waitin for it all 
because i kno i kno i kno
i cant get inside of you
inside of you

im on a trip
i cant get off
cant get over
i want it all 
i want it all
inside of you
i call you up
youre getting off 
im coming over....
