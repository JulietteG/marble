So long,
Go on and waste my time
And don't,
Don't ever cross that line

If you don't,
Then you won't

You'll never know
Unless you take it there
You'll never know
You'll never know
Unless you take it there
Take me there
Take me there
Tonight

So go,
Go on and take your time
But don't,
Don't ever leave my mind
Please don't, don't, don't
Don't ever cross that line

If you don't,
Oh, then you won't

You'll never know
Unless you take it there
You'll never know
You'll never know
Unless you take it there
Take me there
Take me there
Tonight

Take it there with me
Oh, you'll never know
Just take it there with me
Take it there with me
Oh, you'll never know
Just take it there with me

You'll never know
Unless you take it there
You'll never know
You'll never know
Unless you take it there
Take me there (take it there with me)
Take me there (take it there with me)
Take me there (take it there with me)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
