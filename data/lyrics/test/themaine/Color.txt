She Said, "Let it slide,"
All the things that I have running through my mind
Will all be gone in time
Remember son,
All the things you've done,
And all the things you've lost,
And all the things you've won.

We're just trying to find some color in this black and white world.
Tell me everything,
Will be alright.
Walk this way with me,
Into the night.
'Cause you can let it slide, 
Baby just for tonight.
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes.

She said, "Take your time, things will be just fine. Don't bite the hand that feeds, 'cause nothing is ever mine.
And just wait your turn, and always try to learn to love the ones that don't show love in return."

We're just trying to find some color in this black and white world.
Tell me everything,
Will be alright.
Walk this way with me,
Into the night.
'Cause you can let it slide, 
Baby just for tonight.
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes.

When you're walking backwards, 
Don't be afraid to close your eyes.
'Cause the truth is darling,
that everything will be alright. Alright?

Tell me everything, Tell me anything
Walk this way with me, Just tell me everything
'Cause you can let it slide, 
Baby just for tonight.
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes.

Tell me everything,
Will be alright.
Walk this way with me,
Into the night.
'Cause you can let it slide, 
Baby just for tonight.
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes.

Oh yeah, everyone feels cheated sometimes.
Yeah we all feel a little fucked up sometimes.---Lyrics submitted by sue.
