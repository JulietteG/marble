Tell me how to feel like we did...

Tell me how to feel 
like we did when we were young.  
You would take the wheel
Oh yeah, we were on the run. 
And I remember nights 
We would sing till we saw the sun. 
Oh, just tell me how to feel 
like we did when we were young.

Yeah, you were dancing to your favorite song.
And all my friends,
Yeah, they were singing along.
We got down, We got high,
And the world it felt so right.
So lets run free and carry on,
Like we did when we were young.

We turn the music loud
When we drive right through the town.
Oh, we roll the windows down
So the cops won't come around.
T-t-t-take me to the time
things were fine,
They're so broken now.
Yeah, but always keep in mind
things are find and we'll figure it out.

Alright!

Tell me how to feel
 like we did when we were young.
Oh, tell me how to feel 
like we did when we were young.
Young, young,
So young, oh oh...
2,3,4!

Yeah, you were dancing to your favorite song.
And all my friends,
Yeah, they were singing along.
We got down, We got high,
And the world it felt so right.
So lets run free and carry on,
Like we did when we were young.
Like we did when we were young.
Oh, so young.
Like we did when we were young.---Lyrics submitted by Alan Artist.
