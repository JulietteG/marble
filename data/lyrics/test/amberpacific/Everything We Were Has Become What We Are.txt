Is this what you want
No words at all
Silent but sure of the things that you lost
Take all your words
To cover your lies
Secrets won't coat all your tears and your cries

One reason (Reason)
(For past mistakes)
Won't save us now (Now)

I'm lost for words
Too deep in this
For you to see (whoa oh oh)
We've come so far
So far for me
I'm gone with every line you said

So here's to your heart
Here's to your name
Here's to the stone that you broke once again
You've crossed every line
Worn out your stay
This is the last chapter of our fading days

One reason (Reason)
(For past mistakes)
Won't save us now (Now)

I'm lost for words
Too deep in this
For you to see (whoa oh oh)
We've come so far
So far for me
I'm gone with every line you said

And every road you take (You take...)
I'll miss our yesterday (...terday...)
And everything we know (We know...)
Is gone

I'm lost for words
Too deep in this
For you to see (whoa oh oh)
We've come so far
So far for me
I'm gone with every line you said---Lyrics submitted by PapAjefF.
