I can still remember when I bought my First Guitar
Remember just how good the feeling was, put it proudly in my car
And my family listened fifty times to my Two Song Repertoire
And I told Mama her only Son was gonna be a Star

Bought all the Beatles Records, sounded just like Paul
Bought all the old Chuck Berry, 78's and all
And I sat by my Record Player, playing every note they played
And I watched them all on TV, making every move they made

Rock'n'Roll, I gave you all the Best Years of my Life
All the dreamy, sunny Sundays, all the Moonlit Summer Nights
I was so busy in the backrooom writing Love Songs to you
While you were changing your direction and never even knew
That I was always just one step behind you

'66 Seems like the year I was really going some where
We were living in San Fransisco with Flowers in our Hair
Singing Songs of Kindness so the World would understand
That the guys and me were something more than just another band

And then '69 in L.A. came around so soon
We were really making headway and writing lots of tunes
And we must have played the wildest stuff we had ever played
And the way Crowds cried out for us, well, we thought we had it made

Rock'n'Roll, I gave you all the Best Years of my Life
All the Dreamy, Sunny Sundays, all the Moonlit Summer Nights
I was so busy in the backrooom writing Love Songs to you
While you were changing your direction and never even knew
That I was always just one step behind you

Dooodooodooodooo....

'71 In Soho when I saw Suzanne
I was tryin' to go Solo with someone elses Band
And she came up to me later,& I took her by the hand
I told her all my troubles and she seemed to understand

And she followed me through London
Through a hundred Hotel Rooms,
Through a hundred Record Companies
Who didn't like my Tunes;
She followed me when finally
I sold my old Guitar,
She tried to help me
Understand I'd never be a Star. ---Lyrics submitted by Cheryl Riley.
