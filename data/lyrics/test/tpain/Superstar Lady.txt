Booty mwchaglande. she is so excited like she is from another country. she is so erotic I load pornos every sunday. freaky in the bed I tie up like a mermaid. I got her let her meet my mum.

[Chorus:]
I think I gotta supperstar lady.(o yeah... yeah)she's addicted to the flesh and light camera action. a superstar lady. right out of hollywood everything you probably would boy and girl so I.
