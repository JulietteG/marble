Ohhhh [x7]

[Verse 1:]
Hey!
We gonna have a ripping good time
Just hit rewind
And you can see I'm far too crazy
My rhythms and rhymes
Keep niggas in line
Cause now is not the time to be lazy
I'm the ringleader man
A cane in my hand
And an iced out top hat on my head.
Ain't you tired of that wackness
Sick of this wack shit
Wouldn't you like some of me instead
The ringleader man

[Chorus:]
This is my circus I'm working
I can flip this whole thing with one hand
The ringleader man
I know it's a fact that you'd rather just have some of me instead
The ringleader man

[Verse 2:]
Hey!
This in the street is my circus
I know that it hurts
Just sit back and take pain like I use to
And I'm tryin to stop cursing
But I don't give a fuck
I'm goin curse you with lyrical voodoo
I'm the ringleader man
You can't understand
The shit that comes out of my head
But you like all that wackness
Lovin all that wack shit
I'd rather just say fuck you instead
The ringleader man

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Aj.
