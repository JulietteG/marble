Ya, see me yall, im trying to be on mtv y'all, but I aint paid rent and haven't ate in weeks dog.
Sweet tea mob we the hardest yall soft, but its hard to write songs when a niggas lights off, 
Im big vergal that's light skin that's big uzi, we become rap stars we staring in all the movies
Ill have a mansion in the Hamptons by P-diddy, 500 million copies, laughin at that nigga 50
Ill be so rich all my cars will be new ones, if I feel like it I might buy a couple humans
Call doloman tell him bring some weed around, No more five dollar sacks ill buy it by the pound
Graduated from Dickie's and trunk tailors dog, now im wearing Gucci suits and alligators dog
Might by a house on mars now I know your jealous, because my homeboys like hows earth fellas.

[Chorus]
we the mob, we the trillest, the truest and the realist
all my biddy's got the tittys niggas famous muthafucker
We hustle we grind and we solemnly swear to never give a ho a dime, dime
Understand im the man where im from ima rep my city till im done muthafucka

Pow(x4)

We flying on them private jets, im so tired I had to much groupie sex
We doing state wide tours so now whats next, we in places where they speaka no English
Now we back in south Florida in Miami, on south beach tanning with my Grammy
Bought a caddy for everyone in my family, The mob tight like the jacksons Michal tido and randy
Ima go out a legend with plenty bengies considered one of the best like pac and biggy
Sweet tea mob, ya we run Florida, gotta win the battle of the trill in atl 


[Chorus]
we the mob, we the trillest, the truest and the realist
all my biddy's got the tittys niggas famous muthafucker
We hustle we grind and we solemnly swear to never give a ho a dime, dime
Understand im the man where im from ima rep my city till im done muthafucka
