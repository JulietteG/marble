Im back!
Turn it up(x3)

Whats happening muthafucker you know who I is, Its freaknizzle come to turn the party up to ten
I know you herd of me, Freaks get word of me, Wetter then blueberry vodka most certainly
So muthafucker you don't like me, I heard you had a party and did not invite me
Plus I heard it shwasent exciting, Just a buncha bitches pulling hair fighting
I see so much potential, Even though this area is a residential, Turn up the radio, 
Put on the instrumental, Party 101 pick up a muthafucking pencil, 
Im back bitch like that bitch you aint gotta have no bread nigga just act rich.
This aint not fucking party over here, But Lemmie throw this muthafucking money in the air

{Chorus}
Freaknik is back in town, so turn it up
bitches and hos gonna get down, so turn it up
bitchass nigga take off that do-rag, so turn it up
24's and 412's on my new lamb
(x2)

Whats poppin pimparoni get your party hats, Strippers and poles bitches and hos, Whats hot as that
Im a dog on this shit, Yes im all of that, Family bag of barbecue chips, Nigga holla back
I got bitches popping out of my chest, Most of them got they tittys popping out of they chest
All kinds of African diamonds popping out of my neck, If the plane land on the street we hop outa that jet, Its dont matter if your watch got alota baguettes, if you come up in one of my party's you have alota that sex and we here to have a good time you aint gotta vests but if them crackers come they make alota arrests you aint gotta lie to me dog, the weed good and the liquor free dog, 
meatloaf shrimp and rice pelof, don't come up in this corner there's a bitch jackin me off, aint we all


{Chorus}
Freaknik is back in town, so turn it up
bitches and hos gonna get down, so turn it up
bitchass nigga take off that do-rag, so turn it up
24's and 412's on my new lamb
