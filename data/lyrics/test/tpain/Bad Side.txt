Shawty.. 

Yeeahh(4x) 

Shawty I'm the sex-police 
You have been arrested 
It's a warrant for ya 
How do u contest it? 
You must of been hidin' 
Tryna lay low key 
E'rrbody know you cant f*ck with the police 
Nah im just playin withcha 
What's ya name girl 
I'm feelin so good 
You should feel the same girl 
So partake in this louis 
You know it's oowie goowie 
Now let's jump outta this club 
Go home and make a movie 
Shawty you can do me 
And I can do you 
So ain't no use in actin' 
Miss goody two-shoes 
I'm a freak girl and I think you might be one 
Cuz' mama told me watch out for the quiet ones 

Show me your bad side 
Bend over and show me that backside 
Let's go see how the back of this lac' ride 
Show me your bad side 
I plan to take you on another level 
Ain't there a nigga ever take you that high 
Show me your bad side 
You say you want a real man with real money 
Well babygirl I know that's right 
Show me your bad side 
I'mma put you on the silver and gold 
So you can sit back and relax now 
Show me your back side 

Now we drivin' Escalade 
Back to the telly 
Cuttin' everythin' off 
Includin' the cellie 
I made it rain and thunder 
So you chose me 
Tryin' to see what's under 
All of that the Dolce 
And Gabbana 
I really really wanna 
See how far you go cuz' I just noticed that tongue-ring 
And I can go for over 4 hours 
I know u don't believe 
But I'm totempole Jenkins 
Teddy to the P 
Girl I see you lookin' at me 
Go head and close your eyes 
Let me get up in it 
Not only to surprise 
Im tryna get up in that deep blue 
But she screamin' like 
Aaah-Ah 
Aaah-Ah 

Shawty show me your bad side 
Bend over and show me that backside 
Let's go see how the back of this lac' ride 
Show me your bad side 
I plan to take you on another level 
Ain't there a nigga ever take you that high 
Show me your bad side 
You say you want a real man with real money 
Well babygirl I know that's right 
Show me your bad side 
I'mma put you on the silver and gold 
So you can sit back and relax now 
Show me your back side---Lyrics submitted by LaDez.
