[intro]
Some people like thighs (yeah yeah)
Some people like backs (yeah) (six pack)
Some people like booty (yeah) and ain't nothing wrong with that
yeah... ain't nothing more groovy
When that stomach moving yeah
It's the reason that I'm singing this song
Because I ain't got nothing else to bust a nut on
Ooohh..oh....ohhh oh
Whoa whoa whoa

[verse 1]
yeah! pat in the front, pat in the back, that's the way I like it
My fire's ignited, I love it when she ride it
'Cause I can see the part of her I love the most
I love the feeling in me supposed to go
Because I like that tank top that cut off shirt man I like everything that show that belly
Ring (yeah)
Them crunches just got me punching the wall and the pilates got that body looking good in
Them boy short draws but that stomach, yeah whoa

[chorus:]
Shorties got that six pack, four pack you already know that
I'm in love with your stomach
Lay on your back you already know that I'm in love with your stomach
Six pack, throwback, you already know that I'm in love with your stomach
It's the reason I'm singing this song, because nothing else turns me on like a stomach

Got your boy thinking about getting in them pants

[verse 3]
Girl..take this I got it
Take this I got it
I got a bad little roni and you already know me
I'm addicted to the way that she make her stomach roll
5,6 and she thick and little momma loving this thing
And all the sex in the love got me making it that be the shh
She got me on that sprung and she not on that dumb
One that I'm seriously thinking of settling down with but can it be my mind playing tricks on me
She got me excited the way that she move her stomach put my mind back in Hawaii
I never been a freak tied but yo stomach is looking bright..egirl..girl..ey..ey!

[chorus:]
Shorties got that six pack, four pack you already know that
I'm in love with your stomach
Radio throwback, you already know that
I'm in love with your stomach
Six pack, throwback, you already know that
I'm in love with your stomach
Its the reason I'm singing this song (this song) because nothing else to bust a nut on
Whoaa..ohh...ohh..whoah---Lyrics submitted by brandon.
