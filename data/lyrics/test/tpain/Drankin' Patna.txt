Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me

Shorty so perfect
Imma buy the bar, got her drinking everything that I drink
Real talk so far
She even thinking everything that I think
And we like the same girl, not the main girl
She been sipping on that black and blue label
You must seen her, I do my thing, girl
I can't let you drink me under this table
She keep thinking just through the heat and I know that I can't keep up
One more drink and Imma be there
You gonna see me walk out of this club
Hey, she aint even drunk yet
She aint finished that drink yet
Everybody looking at me like Imma stop you
I've done found me a drinking partner

I think I need her to drink a drink with me
I found a girl of my dreams, Ive got you
I've done found me a drinking partner
Everybody wanna, wanna
She be sipping that Corona, Corona
And we aren't turning up in the club without her
I've done found me a drinking partner

I think I'm in love with your cousin
I done seen her take three or four shots already
And we in the club like its nothing
She walked in and everybody say
Here she comes, somebody get the shot girl over here right now
Here she comes, just round them up in front of her
She gonna take them right down

Tonight was so worth it
I done found somebody that like doing everything that I do
We hit the floor, just like that
When I move, you move
Its like we the same person
We drinking even if we aint thirsty
Screaming YOLO in the lane swerving
Im bout to give it up to your paid service
I got a feeling she aint going nowhere till she know that she leaving with me
We drink one more big shot for the night
Shorty, you aint gonna get no sleep
We aint even done yet
We aint even finished this cup yet
Everybody looking at me like Imma stop you
I've done found me a drinking partner

I think I need her to drink a drink with me
I found a girl of my dreams, Ive got you
I've done found me a drinking partner
Everybody wanna, wanna
She be sipping that Corona, Corona
And we aren't turning up in the club without her
I've done found me a drinking partner

I think I'm in love with your cousin
I done seen her take three or four shots already
And we in the club like its nothing
She walked in and everybody say
Here she comes, somebody get the shot girl over here right now
Here she comes, just round them up in front of her
She gonna take them right down

I think I need her to drink a drink with me
I found a girl of my dreams, Ive got you
I've done found me a drinking partner
Everybody wanna, wanna
She be sipping that Corona, Corona
And we aren't turning up in the club without her
I've done found me a drinking partner---
