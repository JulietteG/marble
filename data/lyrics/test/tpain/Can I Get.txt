I know I said I'll never ever drink again (again again)
But now I feel like I never had before
I'll get out on the floor and show them what is wrong

Draw to get that Grammy!
Can I get that pole? Can I get that Henny?
Can I get that Marguerita on the rock rock rock?
I think it's up all around that rim rim
Draw to get that Grammy
Can I get that pole? Can I get that Henny?
Can I get that Marguerita on the rock rock rock?
I think it's up all around that rim rim

Can I get that?
When I wind up in the club I hit that?
Shorty wanna hurry up like a kitkat
Get a couple bottles and a couple models and I wanna sip that
Drone, put 'em in the zone
Hit that, hit it when I'm already in it
Can I get that margarita when I'm chillin' with a mamasita?
See you later on tonight
I say, I shut
My bed, I'm in
The club instead party rockin' with my baby
So I'll never say never
She'll leave me if I let 'er
That's why I gotta keep 'er on the dance floor
Shut up, I feel so much better

I know I said I'll never ever drink again (again again)
But now I feel like I never had before
I'll get out on the floor and show them what is wrong
