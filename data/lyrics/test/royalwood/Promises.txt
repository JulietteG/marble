Well I once believed in a fairy tale
But now Im holding a coffin nail
Between my lips closed tightly where we stand
And fearing now how to wield a sword
The final blow with a righteous word
Cutting away all remains of our ways
The end
O love
Words like dust how we shrug them off
Promises

How to resurrect all the glory days
To build a house where our story stays
Is anyone ever the savior theyd like to be?
Oh one by one though we cant afford
With each new struggle a closing door
Is anyone ever the lover theyd like to be?

Our broken beauty
Can anyone save it?
Our broken beauty
Can anyone save it?
Again---
