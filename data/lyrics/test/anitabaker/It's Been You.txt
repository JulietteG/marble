I had a dream, a love dream so tender
You were with me, old friend, we gave in to sweet surrender
Now I've held it in through October, November
No one else, I have never been the same since then
I've picked up my phone a million times to call you 
but I lost my nerve, cause every time I saw you 
Like a love sick kid, child, it was my paranoia
You would laugh but instead you read these thoughts inside of my head

And it's you, it's been you all the time
You're changing my whole state of mind
It took just a minute, but now that I'm in it
it's you, darling, it's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on the light. Shine. 
Come on and watch me shine, boy. 
It's been you all the time.

Now when you smile the world opens up for me
You're just my style and this time I do believe
We're two of a kind
How could I be so blind?
My heart is sincere
I believe I wanted you for years and years 

And it's you, baby, it's been you all the time
You're changing my whole state of mind
It took just a minute, but now that I'm in it 
It's you, darling, it's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on the light. Shine
Come on and watch me shine, yes 
It's been you all the time

And now to think you've always been right here, yes,
Loneliness has been my greatest fear
until I saw the answer's in your eyes, yes I did,
and at last it's clear, now I see that, you're the only one for me

It's been you all the time. Oh no, baby.
It took just a minute, but now that I'm in it
It's you, darling. It's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on the light. Shine
Come on and watch me shine, boy.
It's been you all the time 
Baby, You turned on the light
It took just a minute, but now that you've got me in it
It's been you all the time.---Lyrics submitted by Melodie.
