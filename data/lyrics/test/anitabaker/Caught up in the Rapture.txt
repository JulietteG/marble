When we met, always knew
I would feel the magic for you
On my mind constantly
In my arms is where you should be

I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly free
I want you in my life for all time

CHORUS:
Caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you

We stand side by side
Till the storms of life pass us by
Light my life, warm my heart
Say tonight will be just the start

I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly free
I want you im my life for all time

CHORUS
Caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you
The feeling's always new
Caught up in the rapture of you

I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly free
I want you in my life for all time

REPEAT SECOND CHORUS

Caught up in the rapture of love
