Oh, woe why do you stay
 And make me feel this awful way?
 You filled my heart with your solemn tune
 And an endless burning blush hue

It's been a basement of a year
 And all I want is for you to disappear

But oh, woe you caught my eye
 And I thought that I'd give you a try
 But you're nothing like the way you looked
 In all those famous songs and books

And now I see how you snuff the light
 And it's so confounding trying to cut you down
 Trying to find a place to begin

Oh, woe please hear this plea
 To walk away and leave me be
 I've weathered more than I can take
 Of your ever-present lonely ache---Lyrics submitted by Brady Kilpatrick.
