Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's no getting over you

I know I'm just a fool who's willin'
To sit around and wait for you
But baby can't you see
There's nothin' else for me to do?
I'm hoplessly devoted to you

But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head, hoplessly devoted to you
Hoplessly devoted to you

My head is sayin', "Fool, forget him"
My heart is sayin', "Don't let go
Hold onto to the end"
That's what I intend to do
I'm hoplessly devoted to you

But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head, hoplessly devoted to you
Hoplessly devoted to you, hoplessly devoted to you---Lyrics submitted by Abby Haines.
