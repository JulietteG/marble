My buddies told me that I should have waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I am happy and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life

I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who would want you to fall 
Others find pleasure in things I despise 
I like the Christian life

My buddies shunned me since I turned to Jesus
But I still love them, though they burden my heart
I'll try to lead them to walk in the light
I like the Christian life

I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who would want you to fall 
Others find pleasure in things I dislike
I like the Christian life

Yeah
Ooo ooo oooo
Yeah

My buddies told me that I should have waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I am happy and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life

I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who would want you to fall 
Others find pleasure in things I dislike
I like the Christian life 

I like the Christian life 

I like it
