You didn't
You didn't just take our sin
You filled us 
You filled us up with Your righteousness

Yes, Your love washed over us, over us
With Your blood you covered us, covered us
Sent Your Son as one of us 
Now Your kingdom's here

Amazing grace
You've shown us Your mercy
You made a way
To bring us back
To bring us back to You

Whoa, whoa

Into You're the light we will walk
We will walk
Yes, into the light we will walk
We will walk
God, into the light we will walk
We will walk
Your presence will lead us
Into the light we will walk
We will walk---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
