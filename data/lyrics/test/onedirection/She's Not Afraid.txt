Yeah, aha, one, two, three, four

[Harry:]
She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She's addicted to feeling of letting go, letting go

[Louis:]
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home, take her home

[Liam:]
But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes her door

[Zayn:]
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love, love

[Niall:]
Maybe she's just trying to test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth, what you're worth

[Louis:]
Maybe all her friends have told her don't get closer
He'll just break your heart

[Niall:]
But either way she sees in the end
And it's just so hard, so hard

[Liam:]
'Cos every time I tell her how I feel
She says it's not real

[Zayn:]
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love, love

[Harry:]
What about all the things we say
Talking on the phone so late
I can't let her get away from me, oh

[Zayn:]
When I say that I can do it no more
She's back at my door

[Niall:]
[Laugh]

[Zayn:]
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love?
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love, love

[Harry:]
She's not afraid
She's not afraid

[All:]
Love, love---Lyrics submitted by ivy reed.
