Stained coffee cup
Just that fingerprinted lipsticks not enough
Sleep, where you lay
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

Waking up, beside you Im a loaded gun
I cant contain this anymore
Im all yours, Ive got no control, no control
Powerless, and I dont care its obvious
I just cant get enough of you
The battles done, my eyes are closed
No control

Taste, on my tongue
I dont want to wash away the night before
In the heat, where you lay
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up, beside you Im a loaded gun
I cant contain this anymore
Im all yours, Ive got no control, no control
Powerless, and I dont care its obvious
I just cant get enough of you
The battles done, my eyes are closed
No control

Lost my senses, Im defenseless
Her perfumes holding me ransom
Sweet and sour, heart devoured
Lying here I count the hours

Waking up, beside you Im a loaded gun
I cant contain this anymore
Im all yours, Ive got no control, no control
Powerless, and I dont care its obvious
I just cant get enough of you
The battles done, my eyes are closed
No control

No control, no control

Powerless, and I dont care its obvious
I just cant get enough of you
The battles now my eyes are closed
No control---
