It feels like we've been living in fast forward,
Another moment passing by.
The party's ending but it's now or never,
Nobody's going home tonight.

Katy Perry's on replay,
she's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake,
the floor to shake
People going all the way,
yeah all the way
I'm still wide awake

[Chorus]
I wanna stay up all night and jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night and find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go
'Cause we've got the floor now, get out of control
I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you
Up all night like this, all night (hey)
Up all night like this, all night (hey)
Up all night

Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she'll wanna kiss me back

Katy Perry's on replay,
she's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake,
the floor to shake 
People going all the way,
yeah all the way
I'm still wide awake

[Chorus]
I wanna stay up all night and jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night and find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go
'Cause we've got the floor now, get out of control
I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you
Up all night like this, all night (hey)
Up all night like this, all night (hey)
Up all night

Katy Perry's on replay, she's on replay
We're gonna wanna stay up all night.
DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
We're gonna wanna stay up all night
Up all night
Up all night
We're gonna wanna stay up all night

[Chorus]
I wanna stay up all night and jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night and find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go
'Cause we've got the floor now, get out of control
I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you
Up all night like this, all night (hey)
Up all night like this, all night (hey)
Up all night---Lyrics submitted by Gema Cruz.
