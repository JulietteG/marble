Whenever I close my eyes, I picture you there
Im looking out at the crowd, youre everywhere
Im watching you from the stage yeah
Youre smile is on every face now
But every time you wake up
Youre hearing me say
Goodbye

Baby, you dont have to worry
Ill be coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you
Lately, Ive been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you.

Ive never been so into somebody before
And every time we both touch I only want more
So tell me nothings going to change yeah
And you wont ever walk away yeah
Cause even though every night youll know what Ill say
Goodbye.

Baby, you dont have to worry
Ill be coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you
Lately, Ive been going crazy
So Im coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you

Right back for you
Right back for you
Right back for you

Lately, Ive been going crazy
So Im coming back
Yeah I am coming back for you

Baby, you dont have to worry
Ill be coming back for you, back for you, back for you, for you
Lately, Ive been going crazy
So Im coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you

Right back for you, right back
Right back for you, right back
Right back for you, right back
Right back for you.

Lately, Ive been going crazy
So Im coming back for you, back for you, back for you, you.---Lyrics submitted by pablo gallaga.
