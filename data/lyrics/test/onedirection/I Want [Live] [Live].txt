Harry:
Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I look inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane

Harry:
You could be preoccupied
Different date, every night
You just got to say the word
You're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard
When girls say...

Together:
I want, I want, I want (Louis: But that's crazy)
l want, I want, I want (Niall: And that's not me)
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

Liam:
You've got everything you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I change the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand
When girls say...

I want, I want, I want, (Louis: But that's crazy)
I want, I want, I want, (Niall: And that's not me)
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
And now the girls say

Together:
I want, I want, I want, (Louis: But that's crazy)
I want, I want, I want, (Niall: And that's not me)
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

Zayn:
Be loved by you
I wanna, I stay true
I wanna, if you knew
What you put me through
But you want, you want, you want me to love you too

Liam:
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you

Zayn:
And all the girls say

Together:
I want, I want, I want, (Louis: But that's crazy)
I want, I want, I want, (Niall: And that's not me)
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
I want, I want, I want, (another all the girls say)
I want, I want, I want, (Zayn: and that's crazy)
I want, I want, I want, (Together: to be loved by you)
