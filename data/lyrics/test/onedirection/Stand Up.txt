From the moment I met you everything changed
I knew I had to get you whatever the pain
I had to take you and make you mine

I would walk through the desert I would walk down the aisle
I would swim all the oceans just to see you smile
Whatever it takes is fine

Oh oh oooh oh so put your hands up
Oh oh oooh oh coz it's a stand up
And I won't be leaving 'til I've finished stealing every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart

I know your hearts been broken but don't you give up
I'll be there yeah I know it to fix you with love
It hurts me to think that you've ever cried

Oh oh oooh oh so put your hands up
Oh oh oooh oh coz it's a stand up
And I won't be leaving 'til I've finished stealing every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart

Oh oh oooh oh so put your hands up
Oh oh oooh oh coz it's a stand up
And I won't be leaving 'til I've finished stealing every piece of your heart

And now we'll steal us a car
And we will drive to the stars
I will give you the moon
It's the least I can do
If you give me the chance

Oh oh oooh oh so put your hands up
Oh oh oooh oh coz it's a stand up
I'm a thief
I'm a thief
You can call me a thief
I'm a thief
I'm a thief
But since you know your part
I'm a thief
I'm a thief
I'm only here
I'm a thief
I'm a thief
Because you stole my heart

(Oh oh oooh oh) I'm a thief I'm a thief
So put your hands up
(Oh oh oooh oh) I'm a thief I'm a thief
Coz it's a stand up
And I won't be leaving 'til I've finished stealing every piece of your heart
(I'm only here)
Coz you stole my heart

(Oh oh oooh oh) I'm a thief I'm a thief
Call me a thief
(Oh oh oooh oh) I'm a thief I'm a thief
Coz you know your part
(Oh oh oooh oh) I'm a thief I'm a thief
I'm only here
(Oh oh oooh oh) I'm a thief I'm a thief
Because you stole my heart---Lyrics submitted by Rose W.
