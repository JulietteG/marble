I keep playing inside my head all that you said to me,
I lie awake just to convince myself that this wasn't just a dream
Cos you were right here and I should've taken the chance,
But I got so scared and I left the moment again.

It's all that I can think about, oh
You're all that I can think about.

Is your heart taken? 
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me,
Am I outta time?
Is your heart breaking? 
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when,
When I should've kissed you.

I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you 
I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you

Every morning when I leave my house I always look for you, yeah
I see you everytime I close my eyes, 
What am I gonna do?
And all my friends say that I'm punching over my weight,
But in your eyes I saw how you were looking at me.

It's all that I cant think about, oh
Your all that that I can think about

Is your heart taken? 
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me,
Am I outta time?
Is your heart breaking? 
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when,
When I should've kissed you.

I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you

When you stood there
Just a heartbeat away,
When we were dancin'
And you looked up at me,
If I had known then
That I'd be feeling this way,
If I could replay
I would have never have let you go, oh no
Never have let you go.

Am I outta time?

Is your heart taken? 
Is there somebody else on your mind?
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused
Just tell me,
Am I outta time?
Is your heart breaking?
How do you feel about me now?
I can't believe I let you walk away when,
When I should've kissed you.

I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda oh, I should've kissed you

I should've kissed you.---Lyrics submitted by amy.
