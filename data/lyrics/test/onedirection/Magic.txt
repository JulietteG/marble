B-B-B-Baby come on over
I don't care if people find out
Dada-Dada-Da-Da-Da-Da
They say that we're not good together
And it's never gonna work out
Dada-Dada-Da-Da-Da-Da

But baby you got me moving too fast
Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl when you looking like that
Dada-Dadada
I can't hold back

Cause you-you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once now I can't leave
Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic

So L- L - Let'em take a picture
Spread it all around the world now
Dada-Dada-Da-Da-Da-Da
I wanna put it on my record
I want everyone to know now
Dada-Dada-Da-Da-Da-Da

But baby you got me moving too fast
Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl when you looking like that
Dada-Dadada
I can't hold back

Cause you-you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once now I can't leave
Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic

Everything you do is magic

They say that we're not good together
And it's never gonna work out
I wanna put it on my record
I want everyone to know now

Everything you do is magic ( x 4 )

Cause you-you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once now I can't leave
Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic

Oh oh oh oh ohhhh ( x 3 )
Kiss you once now I can't leave
Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is magic---
