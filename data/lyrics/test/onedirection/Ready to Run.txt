Theres a lightning in your eyes I cant deny
Then theres me inside a sinking boat, running out of time
Without you Ill never make it out alive
But I know, yes I know, well be alright

Theres a devil in your smile, its chasing me
And every time I turn around, its only gaining speed
Theres a moment when you finally realize
Theres no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes I know that Ill be fine

This time Im ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
Cause I wanna be yours, dont you wanna be mine?
I dont wanna get lost in the dark of the night

This time Im ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young
Ill never look back now Im ready to run
Im ready to run

Theres a future in my life I cant foresee
Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me
There will always be the kind that criticize
But I know, yes I know well be alright

This time Im ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
Cause I wanna be yours, dont you wanna be mine?
I dont wanna get lost in the dark of the night

This time Im ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young
Ill never look back now Im ready to run

This time Im ready to run (ready to run)
Id give everything that Ive got for your love

This time Im ready to run
Escape from the city and follow the sun
Cause I wanna be yours, dont you wanna be mine?
I dont wanna get lost in the dark of the night

This time Im ready to run
Wherever you are is the place I belong
Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young
Ill never look back now Im ready to run---
