Everybody has a First love, they have left in yesterday. 
Feelings they have left behind.
Just the place in time, not so far away.
 Everybody has a first time in the dreams they shred was ...
I remember special someone. So I wrote this song just for you
First love in my life, where are you tonight, I wonder about you.
First love in my life things that had alright, I worry about you.
Cos I in everything , everything in life thou...
And me would tell you now make me sad to know,
You are lonely, First love never die.
Wish you love, wish you happiness,
May the years be kind to you,
You will always be a part of me,
Share this time with me, Oh tell me always
First love, first love never dies, remember
First love, first love never dies, I tell you,
First love, first love never dies.---Lyrics submitted by Marjorie.
