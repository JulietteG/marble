A boy of anguish now, he's a man of soul, 
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road.
The years were cruel to him no, 
He will let them go.
Lays awake tryna' find the man inside to pack his bags and escape this world.

I've never been so torn up in all of my life, 
I should of seen this coming.
I've never felt so hopeless, 
Than I did tonight.
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on.

He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile.
So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside.
He's read the scene and unpacked the man that he had became.
So leave him trailing on the fasttrack to falling into his grave.

I've never been so torn up in all of my life, 
I should of seen this coming.
I've never felt so hopeless, 
Than I did tonight.
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on.

I can't believe I've come so far in such a time, 
And I'm still fighting on my own.
I fucked up to catch my breath I may never breathe again, so just notice:

I've never been so torn up in all of my life, I can't believe I let myself breakdown.

I've never been so torn up in all of my life, 
I should of seen this coming.
I've never felt so hopeless, 
Than I did tonight.
I don't wanna do this anymore... 

I've never been so torn up in all of my life, 
I should of seen this coming.
I've never felt so hopeless, 
Than I did tonight.
No I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on.

A boy of anguish now, he's a man of soul, 
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road.---Lyrics submitted by Wylie Brown.
