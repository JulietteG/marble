Please you have to help me
This is not my true face
If you could see my soul
As I have seen my soul
I could show it to you
It's rotten
It's poison
Help me please

Please, give me a fucking excuse
I beg for just one reason to give you regret
Regret!

Are you with me or are you on your own
It's time to choose your side
So choose your side!
Are you with me or are you on your own
It's time to choose your side
So choose your fucking side!

Could be the end of the world
Woah
I'd still be laid here on my own, wasting my life away!
Could be the end of the world
Woah! 
I'd still be laid here on my own, wasting my life away!

Hear me now!
Get off your knees
Nothing changes when you pray
I'm the closest thing to a God you'll ever know!
Get off your knees!
Open your eyes!

I'll regret, never again!
And I stand above you!
I'll regret, never again!
And I stand above you!

And I can't feel this pain anymore
And I can't carry on this way
I'm hiding behind false eyes

Could be the end of the world
Woah!
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away!
Could be the end of the world
Woah!
I'd still be laid here on my own, wasting my life away!

Over and over
Over and over
Fuckin' Hell
Fuck!---Lyrics submitted by greta k.
