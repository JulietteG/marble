Even though Im on my own, I know Im not alone
Because I know theres someone, somewhere praying that I make it home
So heres one from the heart, my life right from the start
I need a home sweet home to call my own
To call my own

It was you that told me I could do this
You put the music in my heart
And how you sang with the band in Memphis
Its hard just to be strong not knowing if Ive done you proud
I like to imagine you smile when you hear my songs

Even though Im on my own, I know Im not alone
Because I know theres someone, somewhere praying that I make it home
So heres one from the heart, my life right from the start
I need a home sweet home to call my own

A letter home and I know we dont speak much
And we both know Im not keen to but I think theres things Ive left unsaid
Im okay dont worry
I wish Id been a better kid
Im trying to slow down
Im sorry for letting you down

Even though Im on my own, I know Im not alone
Because I know theres someone, somewhere praying that I make it home
So heres one from the heart, my life right from the start
I need a home sweet home to call my own

You know its just rock and roll
I know youre by my side through it all
My terror twin and I
Lets take over the world

Even though Im on my own, I know Im not alone
Because I know theres someone, somewhere praying that I make it home
So heres one from the heart, my life right from the start
I need a home sweet home to call my own
