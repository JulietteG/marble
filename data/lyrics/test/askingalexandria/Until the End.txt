This isn't me any more, 
I need something to believe in

If you think you've seen the last of me
The flat line has come and gone 
But wo't take me away
I'm tortured
By this dream I've manufactured
War torn
From the inside out but it makes me stronger
I'm not the person you see
When you look into these eyes
I've got a reason
To believe in something more
I know there's something more

I've heard it all before, 
But I won't sing my last song 
'Til I'm flat out on the floor
I've longed for so much more, 
I wanna be the best that I can be

I'm sick and tired of being admired, 
I don't deserve this pedestal you've put me on
All I want is to be proud of who I am
I brought this hell upon myself, 
Now I gotta see it through 'til the end---Lyrics submitted by Benjamin Patter.
