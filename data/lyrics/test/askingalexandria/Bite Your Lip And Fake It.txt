Take the broken heart and stitch it up with some tears
Blush it up, dress it up and put it on ice, it keeps us cold
Frozen your lips turn lullabies numb
You're laughing melodies in time with heartbreak and rhyme

Don't go blowing me a kiss,
'Cause you'll see it break down in all its elegance,
Like a model wearing the wrong make-up for her own fashion parade
Biting your lip and I know,
You are faking it, you are hating it

Writing another lipstick letter, painting our script. you're the artist.
Red for the love, white for the lies, black the clichs, I'll see it in your eyes
Brush in some red, sketch in some blue, picture perfect, me and you
Don't forget the title, "Inventing Tragedy in Black and White"

Don't go blowing me a kiss,
Cos' you'll see it break down in all its elegance,
Like a model wearing the wrong make-up for her own fashion parade
Biting your lip, I know your faking it,
Letting it bleed, I know you're hating it

Painting my tragedy, singing my tragedy
But would you blow me a kiss?
At the bottom of your letters
All of my love
All of my hate
All of my love

There's no melody that fits with drop-dead gorgeous
Your name doesn't fit with the chorus or a line from her song,
But she's singing your tragedy, and her lipstick stains, me and you

Now take a look at me
Feel the ... I'm drowning in
You know I'm faking it for the sake of ruining your world

Well you were something mixed in desire
I can taste the fake in your breath, but i want more

[2X] Would you blow me, would you blow me a kiss?

I know your looking at me
Your look will drown in the ...---
