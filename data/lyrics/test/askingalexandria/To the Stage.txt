I'm out the door, I'm on my ass again like every night before
I'm off the wall, out of my fucking mind, I'm out of control
I'll be the end of her, I'm in her head and in control
She's let me in, now take a sip and let the show begin
The floor's all yours, the house is full
You've made the slip now take the fall
I pull your strings, you're too deep in
So will she sink or swim

Oh she's drown, how very spectacular
What a works of art I've spawned
Man am I proud of myself on this one
She's such a fucking masterpiece
Self destruction is such a pretty little thing

I know that I should walk away
But I can't bring myself to quit this game
She's just a beautiful girl with the weight of the world on her shoulders
I'm just a kick in the teeth from a world that's painted gold

She's out the door, she's on her ass again like every night before
She's off the wall, out of her fucking mind, she's out of control
I was the end of her
In her head, in control

Just like before
I should've told you again
That I'm sorry
I'm so sorry---Lyrics submitted by Coby.
