This was yours for the taking
This was yours for the taking
This was yours for the taking
Run free!  


A frail world holds your mind,  
Escape your inhibitions,
Taste the wind,
Let your hair down,
Hold your head up


Go, go, go,
But don't forget the consequences
Go, go, go,
Let go, running free


Open your- open your mind
To a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly
To a new world, to a new world


This was yours for the taking
This was yours for the taking
This was yours for the taking
Run free-ee-e-e-e!


A frail world holds your mind,
This was yours for the taking
All the while, screaming loud
This is my life


Go, go, go,
But don't forget what came before
Go, go, go,
Let go, running free


Open your- open your mind
To a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly
To a new world, to a new world



MOOVE!
Your eyes are focused on  the people that this world has produced
We walk, we die, and we move on, to whatever the hell's next
No matter what in the end, we're not escaping the ghost
Did you live from month to month to try to follow your dreams?


You won't, you won't be alone in the end
You don't, have to be afraid
A free world, we can stop with the egos
A free world, let your love take over


You won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid---Lyrics submitted by Matthew Duggan.
