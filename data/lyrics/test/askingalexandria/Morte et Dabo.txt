So he came forth and said onto me, "Son you are foresaken."
"Condemned for the sins that you live, I offer you forgiveness" (x2)

Bow down before me (x2)

I'll never bow to he who claims to be divine
I'll tear down your gates with my bare fucking hands, and burn the world that you rule over.
No matter how convinced you are, you're not a god of mine.
You're not a fucking god of mine.

I never believed in you.
From what I see, it was justified
I never believed in you, in you.

This power over the masses is a gift you dont deserve.
When your blood spills, we'll drink from your skull.
You can run, but you can't hide.

Bitch, I'll fucking find you and tear your eyes out of your self-righteous face.
Lord, I'll fucking find you and tear your tongue out of your rancid fucking mouth.

Heaven will burn to the fucking ground.
Your world will crumble and fall from the sky.
Blood will spill and rain upon the Earth.
Your reign is over, and I'll wear your crown.

This is your demise.
I know you feel it in your chest.
This is your demise.
It's getting closer.
This is your demise.
I'm creeping from the depths of hell.
This is your demise.
I know where you sleep.

I never believed in you.
From what I see, it was justified.
I never believed in you, in you.

What a way to end the world, with false hope in a false god.
What a way to end the world, with false hope in you. (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Gabe.
