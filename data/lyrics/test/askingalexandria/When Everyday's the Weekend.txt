Another Sunset
What a way to start another messy night
Another drink
Another bar
Another girl inside my arms
I can't see straight anymore
Just got kicked out the fucking door

It's all easy
It's all easy
That's how we fucking ROLL

Tonight's our night like every night before
Until we fall
Until we fall

We'll drink you under
The fucking table
Rack 'em up
Put 'em down
Rack 'em up
Put 'em down

I like to party
You like to party
We like to party
All night long
I like to party
You like to party
We like to party
All fucking year---Lyrics submitted by Serena.
