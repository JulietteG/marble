Someone follow us, were on the run tonight
So light the fuse, hold me close, too young to lose.
Just like the dream, running against the wind with no regrets,
Leave behind our innocence.

And he said listen, listen,
Im not afraid to go if its with you,
I was born to live for you
And Im like Juliet, waiting to see the sunset on the rise,
No goodbyes, Id rather die.

So thats a dance across the line,
Say your love is mine.

Well find somewhere to hide, well stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright.
Baby, just keep searching, youre safe
Dont worry, well find somewhere to hide.

King and queen, now, well climb the highest peak
And call it ours, paint the sky and bring the stars.
Lift me off the ground, were gonna spin around till we collapse,
Burn the map stay where we're at

So thats a dance across the line,
Say your love is mine.

Well find somewhere to hide, well stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright.
Baby, just keep searching, youre safe
Dont worry, well find somewhere to hide.

Well find somewhere to hide, well stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright.
Baby, just keep searching, youre safe
Dont worry, well find somewhere to hide.

Well find somewhere to hide,
Well find somewhere to hide.

Well find somewhere to hide, well stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright.
Baby, just keep searching, youre safe
Dont worry, well find somewhere to hide.

Well find somewhere to hide, well stay out of sight
Until we know everything is alright.
Baby, just keep searching, youre safe
Dont worry, well find somewhere to hide.

Well find somewhere to hide,
Well find somewhere to hide.---Lyrics submitted by alexis.
