Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth
Would care to know my name
Would care to feel my hurt

Who am I, that the bright and morning star
Would choose to light the way
For my ever  wandering heart

VERSE:
Not because of who I am
But because of what You've done
Not because of what I've done
But because of who You are

CHORUS:
I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow
A wave tossed the ocean 
A vapor in the wind
Still You, here me when I'm calling
Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
And You've told me who i am
I am Yours, I am Yours

Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin
Would look on me with love
And watch me rise again

Who am I, that the voice that calm the sea
Would call out through the rain 
And calm the storm in me
(Repeat verse)
(Repeat chorus 2x)

I am Yours
Whom shall I fear
Whom shall I fear,
'Cause I am Yours
I am Yours---Lyrics submitted by farrah.
