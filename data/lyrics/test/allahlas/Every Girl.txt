Deep her smile is friend
She's made her way to my dream again
Watch the way that she walks
You know she's the best girl on the block
There goes Juliet
You know I've always been a perfect stand
I start to think I'll make her mine
Think tomorrow she'll be out of my mind

Oh end it all, every girl is gonna walk on me
Oh end it all, every girl is gonna walk on me
Oh end it all, every girl is gonna walk on me
Oh end it all, every girl is gonna walk on me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hate it raining through me
You're 'bout to find and see that I never see
Want to take you for a ride
But Lord knows I gotta wonder it out
I heard that Susie knew
Yeah, all the wild things she does to you
Man here is all about
Love it's all till the end of time

Oh end it all, every girl is gonna walk on me
Oh end it all, every girl is gonna walk on me
Oh end it all, every girl is gonna walk on me
Oh end it all, every girl is gonna walk on me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah---
