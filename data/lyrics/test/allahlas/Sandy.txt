Time after time, girl
Like Daedalus' child
You wasted your mind, girl.
You had to be wild.
Now I see that you're lost.
I gotta plan for you.
Don't think 'bout what you've done,
But what you can do.
Time flies when you're having fun,
But where does it go?
You flew too close to the sun.
Now you just don't know.

I can't believe the things you say.
You couldn't mean them anyway.
You try to give me the run-around,
But I ain't gonna let you run my town, no.
I can't believe the things you say.

Time after time, girl.
Like Daedalus' child
You wasted your mind, girl.
You had to be wild.
Now I see that you're lost.
What's a girl to do?
Those T's you've left uncrossed
Are coming back to you.
Time flies when you're having fun,
But where does it go?
You flew too close to the sun.
Now you just don't know.---Lyrics submitted by Michael McAllis.
