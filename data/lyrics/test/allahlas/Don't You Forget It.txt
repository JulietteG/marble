I think I've found a girl that I can talk to
I think I've found a girl that just might replace you
She don't care if I got bread 
And I remember the things she said
Well I think that she might do, uh huh

Don't you forget it

Cos when the summertime leaves your town
You know you ain't gonna find me around 
I'll be out there to follow the sun 
You know I ain't gonna take no one

And if you thought that you tied me down
Well, girl, it high time that you found
The only thing you'll ever live to see
You'll never find another man like me

I don't think I wanna hear about none of your problems
You like to act like you're the only one who's ever got them
But I know something you don't know
You're gonna reap just what you sow
You stole some time of mine, now it's time for you to go

Don't you forget it---Lyrics submitted by Michael McAllis.
