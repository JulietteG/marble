Looked through you 
Cos I couldn't get there
Looked to you 
Cos I thought we went there

But I'm not like the kind that you've had before
Not gonna run through that open door
Not gonna try to get what I wasn't given

But I can see that you long for yourself
I can tell that you need to belong on a shelf
Time goes by as you sit here and wait in your room
I can see that you need someone close real soon

I've done a lot for you
Like I've done before
When I came right through
Picked you off the floor

I spent a lot of time
Just to get your name
You were a friend of mine
I thought you felt the same

But I can see that you long for yourself
I can tell that you need to belong on a shelf
Time goes by as you sit here and waste in your room
I can see that you need someone's touch real soon

I've done a lot for you---Lyrics submitted by Michael McAllis.
