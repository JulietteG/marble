Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about,
The more I want to let you know:
That everything you do,
Is super fucking cute
And I can't stand it

I've been searching for
A girl that's just like you
Cause I know
That your heart is true

Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about,
The more I want to let you know:
That everything you do,
Is super duper cute
And I can't stand it

Let's sell all our shit,
And run away
To sail the ocean blue
Then you'll know,
That my heart is true

Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about,
The more I want to let you know:
That everything you do,
Is super duper cute
And I can't stand it

You, you got me where you want me
Cause I'll do anything to please you
Just to make it through:
Another year

You, I saw you across the room
And I knew that this is gonna
Blossom into something beautiful.
You're beautiful.

Baby, I love you
I never want to let you go
The more I think about,
The more I want to let you know:
That everything you do,
Is super duper cute
And I can't stand it
No I can't stand it
No I can't stand it---Lyrics submitted by ivy lata.
