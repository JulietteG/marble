Hey everybody take a look around
Put your money where your mouth is
Take your eyes off the ground
We've got a hard day a comin' if we can't work out
All the pissy little problems that we're fighting about 

(Aye!)

See I never got involved in politics
Cause they always brought out the worst in my folks
But I always swore to them if I could make a change at all
I'd love this world before it implodes 

Cause we all want change
And we want it now

Hey everybody take a look around 
Put your money where your mouth is
Take your eyes off the ground
We've got a hard day a comin' if we can't work out
All the pissy little problems that we're fighting about 

(Aye!) 

And love is the weapon for this lukewarm congregation
And love is the only thing that's kept me believin'
And love is the weapon for this wounded generation
And love is the only thing that's kept me believin' 

That the world will change (the world will all change)
Yeah we all want change (we want it now)

Hey everybody take a look around 
Put your money where your mouth is
Take your eyes off the ground
We've got a hard day a comin' if we can't work out
All the pissy little problems that we're fighting about 

(Aye!)---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
