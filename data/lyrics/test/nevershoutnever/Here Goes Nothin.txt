If timing's everything, stop telling me you're taking your time
I know you're anxious, but you're running your mouth like you're five years old again
It's so hard to pretend

Like I know everything, I dont know anything
I wanted you to see (that I got nothin')

I'll sit back and I'll watch the show
I'll lay awake and I'll watch the stars as they collide

And my eyes, they don't see
And I don't breathe the way I used to
Yeah lips (woah), they don't sing
And I won't be the way I was on that night

Steady breathing is all I can advise
To a girl with a sweet tooth for revenge
I know I'm crazy but it's so hard to pretend

Like I know everything, I don't know anything
I wanted you to see (that I got nothin')

I'll sit back and I'll watch the show
I'll lay awake and I'll watch the stars as they collide

And my eyes, they don't see
And I don't breathe the way I used to
Yeah my lips (woah), they don't sing
And I won't be the way I was on that night

It was the night everybody agreed I was wrong about you
I told them you were being so strong
I knew you were a liar
I knew you were a liar from the start
(x2)

Don't treat me like I'm playing a game 
'Cause baby I don't want to lose
Baby I don't want to risk it all for you

And my eyes, they don't see
And I don't breathe the way I used to
Yeah my lips (woah), they don't sing
And I won't be the way I was on that night---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
