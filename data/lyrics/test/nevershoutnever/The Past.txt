And I sing songs about the past. 
How I was raised and I was thrown out on my ass, 
Cause I didn't care. 
About going to school. 

And I saw the look in her eyes. 
My mother nearly cried when I had told her that I had wanted to go, 
Just to prove them wrong. 

I've been smoking cigarettes since I was only fourteen, 
Just to find an escape from this town that was so mean to me. 

And I sing songs about my friends. 
The way we grew up, and all the lose ends we used to laugh, 
Cause we didn't give a damn. 

And I saw the look in my brother's eyes, 
When I told him I was leaving he couldn't help but despise me. 
He's wanted out his whole life. 

I've been smoking the green since I was merely sixteen, 
Just to find an escape from this town that was so mean to me. 

And I sing songs about the past. 

I plead for relief, 
This town won't receive 
All the things that I want. 
The things that I need. 

And I'll beg and I'll beg. 
I'm down on my knees. 
Mama, oh mama, 
Let me please leave 

I plead for relief. 
This town won't receive, 
All the things that I want. 
The things that I need. 

All I ever wanted was love.---Lyrics submitted by mikylaa.
