I like you. 
Girl you don't got nothin to prove to me 
I know that times have been rough 
For the both of us 
But I'll pray for a change 

You see this world has lots to offer 
But in time it will go dark 
And if this love is what we see it is 
I'm sure we will go far 
And with a girl as sweet as you 
There's not much else I can do 
But fall for you 

You know that I'm a wreck 
And you know I can't breathe 
At the edge of my seat with each word 
As the months turn into years 
Just know that I will wait here for you 
Cause I prayed for a change 

You see this world has lots to offer 
But in time it will go dark 
And if this love is what we see it is 
I'm sure we will go far 
And with a girl as sweet as you 
There's not much else I can do 
But fall for you 
For you [X3]

This world has lots to offer 
But in time it will go dark 
And if this love is what we see it is 
I'm sure we will go far 
And with a girl as sweet as you 
There's not much else I can do 
But fall for you---Lyrics submitted by Sydney.
