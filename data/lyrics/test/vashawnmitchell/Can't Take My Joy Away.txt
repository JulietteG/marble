Persecuted, 
But not forsaken.
Cast down, 
But not destroyed.
I have something,
This world cant take, 
Away from me.
(Repeat)

No matter how hard you try, 
You cant take it.
I may even have to cry but Ill,
Ill make it.
Theres, 
Joy for my sorrows, 
Hope for tomorrow
I have something, 
This world cant take away.
Ive been persecuted.

CHORUS (1x)

In the midst of my trials I will, 
Be alright.
In the midst of my pain I know I will, 
Ill survive.
Theres joy for my sorrows, 
I have, hope for tomorrow. 
I have something, 
This world cant take away.
Ive been persecuted YEAH

Persecuted, 
But not forsaken.
Cast down, 
But not destroyed.
I have something
This world cant take,
I have something
This world cant take.
I have something
This world cant take.
AWAY FROM ME

Cant take my joy away.
Cant take my joy away.
Cant take my joy away.
Cant take my joy away.

Im a survivor!
Ill make it!
Im a survivor!
Ill make it!
Ill make it!
Ill make it!
Ill make it!
Ill make it!
Ill make it!

Cant take my joy away!
Cant take my joy away! (4xs)
