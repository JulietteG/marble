Verse1; I climbed up to the highest mountain
I looked all around , couldn't find nobody 
Went down into the deepest valley
Looked all around down there, couldn't find nobody
I went across the deep blue sea
Couldn't find one to compare... to your grace, your
love, your mercy
Nobody greater... nobody greater than you 

(Chorus') 2Times  (Still Him)
Searched all over... couldn't find nobody
I looked high and low... still couldn't find nobody
Nobody greater... nobody greater no.. nobody greater
than you

Verse 2; Nobody can heal.. like you can
oh most holy one you are the Great I Am
 Awesome in all your ways and mighty in your hand
You are He who carried out redemption's plan
You are He who carried out redemption's plan

[Chorus: *2 ]; Searched all over... couldn't find nobody
I looked high and low.. still couldn't find nobody
Nobody greater... nobody greater... nobody greater
than you 

Nobody greater... nobody greater... nobody greater
than you [repeat, adlib and fade]---Lyrics submitted by Felicia.
