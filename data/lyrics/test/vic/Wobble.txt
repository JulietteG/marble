Oh,oh,oh,oh
all the shawtys in the club
(let me see you just)
back it up, drop it down
(let me see you just)
get low n scrub the grown
(let me see you just)
push it up, push it up
(let me see you just)

Chorus
wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble (yeah) (x4)
get in there, yeah, yeah (x4)
ey big girl make em' back it up, make em' back it up (x4)

Verse 1:
I got em' shakin their boobies like congos,
man I'm shaking the city like quakes.
the haters blowin the face like gonzo,
cause I'm baking a cake so lets bake.
I'm taking the game, the games mine.
Yall witness a change it's my time.
Yall new to the game but yall might wanna save ya whack raps daylight saving time
I could dance homie, i dont 2-step,
yall looking at something like a true player.
A girl told me that a man that could dance might could possibly get down with the tool in his pants.
Now all my ladies let me see you vibrate.
and when its over you aint gon need ya vibrator.
cuz im a pro, make ya bend ya back low den just pound it real fast just like purkulator
Chorus
wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble (yeah) (x4)
get in there, yeah, yeah (x4)
ey big girl make em' back it up, make em' back it up (x4)

Verse 2:
girl wobble it, and ima gobble it.
i see you movin your head, your head bobblin'
we can cradle the bed im straight rockin it
the girls say my head like the head of a rocket ship
god damn im so explicit, but i cant help it my flow ridiculous
boy got a gift like it gotta be christmas
swag dont miss like he gotta be gifted
the girls brought cameras and they want pictures
and they gon frame em to see dat nigga
little to the bed while im sayin my scriptures
cuz i leave ya holy like ya pray in the temple
want beat? i move with the led of a pencil
and mine wont miss you, goodnight kiss you
take a band back, cuz you got pistols
and i dont think ?? can run these issues

Chorus
wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble (yeah) (x4)
get in there, yeah, yeah (x4)
ey big girl make em' back it up, make em' back it up (x4)
