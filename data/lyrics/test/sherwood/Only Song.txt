And I'm ok
Seems I just needed a break
Sat down but now I'm up again
And finding out I'm alone
My friends left me behind
And into another town
Where this boy is not around
And I don't blame them
I'd do the same

And now I'm alone again

So I'll sing along to the only song I've ever known
And I'll sing it out to the lonely ones, oh oh oh
Those days are gone but the nights roll on taking their place
So I'm singing it out to the lonely ones

Hey, let's write the story again
Where I'm your lover and best friend
Pack our backs and we'll leave this old ghost town behind
And into another town
Where this boy is not around
He made the mistake of leaving you

That was mistake number ten

So I'll sing along to the only song I've ever known
And I'll sing it out to the lonely ones, oh oh oh
Those days are gone but the nights roll on taking their place
So I'm singing it out to the lonely ones

Hey, let's write the story again
Where I'm your lover and best friend

So I'll sing along to the only song I've ever known
And I'll sing it out to the lonely ones, oh oh oh
Those days are gone but the nights roll on taking their place
So I'm singing it out to the lonely ones, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh---Lyrics submitted by arvin.
