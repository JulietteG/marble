Tonight I'm staring at the moonlight
Tonight I'm wondering how this could have felt so right
I can say it was a good time
I can hardly say a thing
He's got you right where he wants you
Right where he wants you

He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I supposed to do
You want fun I can go another time with you
Tell me why would I want to

Will you still be feeling alright
In the morning with the sun creeping through the blinds
Will you say it was a good time
Will you tell him anything
He's got you right where he wants you
Right where he wants you

He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I supposed to do
You want fun I can go another time with you
Tell me why would I want to

Outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I supposed to do
You want fun I can go another time with you
Tell me why would I want to

I've been away for far too long it seems
And this brand new group of friends is making me ready again to leave
I'm ready again to leave

He's going outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I supposed to do
You want fun I can go another time with you
Tell me why would I want to

Outside in the middle of the night with you
Tell me what I supposed to do
You want fun I can go another time with you
Tell me why would I want to
Tell me why would I want to---Lyrics submitted by Jackie.
