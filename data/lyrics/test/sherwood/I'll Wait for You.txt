All in a day,
See it for yourself,
I'll make no change,
When you are somewhere else,
And I'll write for you,
Every chance I get,
Tell me you'll listen,
And say you won't forget

And I'll never say I don't have time, when you need me with you,
I'll stand in line, if you want me to, and I'll wait for you,
I'll wait for you

Everyday,
See it for yourself,
I'll make no plans,
When you are somewhere else,
And I'll sing for you,
Songs that no one hears,
But tell me you'll listen,
And say I'll have your ears

And I'll never say I don't have time, when you need me with you,
I'll stand in line, if you want me to, and I'll wait for you,
I'll wait for you

And if you have something to say,
Know I won't look away,
No, I won't look away,

And I'll never say I don't have time, when you need me with you,
I'll stand in line, if you want me to, and I'll wait for you,
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you

I'll keep on waiting for you,
You'd wait for me, whoa,
I'll keep on waiting for you,
You'd wait for me (yeah) whoa,
I'll keep on waiting for you,
You'd wait for me, whoa,
I'll keep on waiting for you (I'll keep on waiting)
You'd wait for me, whoa---Lyrics submitted by Ivy.
