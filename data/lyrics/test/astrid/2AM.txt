Cold, running through my body
Nothing ever felt so right
I could get lost
Youre all that I want
I need you here by my side

Youre running through my body
I feel it inside my bones
Dont know whats happening
You got me tripping
I dont wanna be

Alone tonight
Youre out of sight
O-oh
So where you at?
Where you at?

World slows down
Ive lost my ground
O-oh
Where you at?
Where you at?

Two in the morning
I cant control it
Lost in the moment
I just cant get no sleep

Eh

Two in the morning
Everything's frozen
I keep on falling
And I just cant get no sleep

Cold, the skys getting cloudy
nd my eyes start raining
Making a river
As it grows bigger
Its pulling me way down stream

Now the water is rising
My heads going under
Drowning my thoughts
Turning em of
And I just wonder

Where you at
Please take me back
O-oh
Its killing me (killing me)
Its killing me (killing me)

World slows down
Ive lost my ground
O-oh
Its killing me
K-k-k-killing me

Two in the morning
I cant control it
Lost in the moment
I just cant get no sleep

Eh

Two in the morning
Everything's frozen
I keep on falling
And I just cant get no sleep

Insomnia, Insomnia
Insomnia, Insomnia
I cant get no sleep
Insomnia, Insomnia
Insomnia, Insomnia
I cant get no sleep

Two in the morning
I cant control it
Lost in the moment
I just cant get no sleep

Two in the morning
Everything's frozen
I keep on falling
And I just cant get no sleep

Two in the morning
I cant control it
Lost in the moment
I just cant get no sleep

Eh

Two in the morning
Everything's frozen
I keep on falling
And I just cant get no sleep---
