Ladies and gentelmen
May I have your attention
I want to introduce to you
In this corner
Of the good and the right
Stands the Champion robed in white
His height exceeds the heavens
His weight outweighs the worlds
His reach reaches everywhere
His age is evermore

Chorus:
He is higher than the highest
Greater than the great
No one will ever take His crown away
He's more mighty than the mightiest
He reigns from above
He's the all-time,
Undisputed, undefeated champion of love

He left His hometown
To enter this arena
To raise His hands in victory for me
An angry crowd crucified
This king who wore the crown
And they gladly watched the Champion going down
But I will never count Him out
For I'm a witness of
The day he rose to retain the title
Champion of Love

He is higher than the highest
Greater than the great
No one will ever take His crown away
He's more mighty than the mightiest
He reigns from above

He is higher than the highest
Greater than the great
No one will ever take His crown away
He's more mighty than the mightiest
He reigns from above
He's the all-time,
Undisputed, undefeated Champion
He's the all-time,
Undisputed, undefeated Champion of Love
