My mouth is like a loaded gun
I'm shooting it off to anyone
Don't need for them to understand
I wanna feel like I'm a man
I'm checking you out, I'm not checking in
Up and down as the music begins
My head is spinning round and round
My head is gonna hit the ground

We should be
We should be
We should be
We should be lovers
We should be lovers
'Cause we can't be friends
We should be lovers
'Cause we can't be friends

I've had my fill, I've had my fall
I've had enough of everyone
The tapping feet, coolest labels
The lost and found at every table
Lights go out, the music goes down
Reality hits like a smack in the mouth
The DJ spins it round and round
Oh DJ spin me round and round

We should be
We should be
We should be
We should be lovers
We should be lovers
'Cause we can't be friends
We should be lovers
'Cause we can't be friends
Oh we can't be friends
Oh we can't be friends

We should be
We should be
We should be
We should be
My mouth is like a loaded gun
(We should be)
I'm shooting it off to everyone
(We should be)
Don't need for them to understand
(We should be)
I wanna feel like I'm a man

We should be lovers
We should be lovers
'Cause we can't be friends
We should be lovers
'Cause we can't be friends
No we can't be friends
Oh we can't be friends
Oh we can't be friends---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
