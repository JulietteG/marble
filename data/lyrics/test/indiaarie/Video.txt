Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I dont 
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I wont 
Depend of how the wind blows I might even paint my toes 
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul 

Im not the average girl from your video 
And I aint built like a supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally, 
Because I am a queen 

I not the average girl from your video 
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes 
No matter what Im wearing I will always be 
India.Arie 

When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me 
Every freckle on my face is where its suppose to be 
And I know my creator didnt make no mistakes on me 
My feet, my thighs, my Lips, my eyes, Im loving what I see 

Am I less of a lady if I dont where panty hose 
My momma said a lady aint what she wears but what she knows 
But Ive drawn the conclusion, its all an illusion 
Confusions the name of the game 
A misconception, a vast deception, 
Something got to change 

Now dont be offended this is all my opinion 
Aint nothing that Im saying law 
This is a true confession 
Of a life learned lesson 
I was sent here to share with y'all 
So get in when you fit in 
Go on and shine 
Clear your mind 
Nows the time 
Put your salt on the shelf 
Go on and love yourself 
Cause everythings gonna be alright 

Keep your fancy drink, and your expensive minks 
I dont need that to have a good time 
Keep your expensive cars and your caviar 
Alls I need is my guitar 

Keep your crystal and your pistol 
Id rather have a pretty piece of crystal 
Dont need you silicone, I prefer my own 
What god gave me is just fine---
