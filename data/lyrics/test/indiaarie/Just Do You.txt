I heard a voice that told me I'm essential
How all my fears are limiting my potential
Said it's time to step into the light and
Use every bit of the power I have inside

So what'chu waiting on
Who You waiting for
If You don't take a chance You'll never know what's in store

Just Do You (Somebody's got to be a star)
Just Do You (Somebody's got to raise the bar)
Just Do You (Somebody's got to change the game)
Just Do You (Today)

Every mountain needs someone to climb it
Every ocean needs someone to dive in
Every dream needs someone to wish it
Every adventure needs someone to live it

So what'chu waiting on
Who You waiting for
If You don't take a chance You'll never know what's in store

Just Do You (Somebody's got to be a star)
Just Do You (Somebody's got to raise the bar)
Just Do You (Somebody's got to change the game)
Just Do You (Today)

If You create the game then You create the rules
And if You just be You
There's no way You can lose

There's a story waiting for you to write it
There's a treasure waiting for you to find it
There's a picture waiting for you to paint it
There's a dollar waiting for you to make it

So what'chu waiting on
Who You waiting for
If You don't take a chance You'll never know what's in store

Just Do You (Somebody's got to be a star)
Just Do You (Somebody's got to raise the bar)
Just Do You (Somebody's got to change the game)
Just Do You (Today)

If You create the game then You create the rules
And if You just be You
There's no way You can lose ---Lyrics submitted by AMBERTHOMPSON.
