I'm standing on my own two feet,
Somewhere hangin' in between,
My life and the death of me.
Fate doesn't leave us time to waste,
Weaving through the human race,
Till we run out of air to breathe.

But no one's getting out alive!
All the gold on Earth, it won't buy time!
So we might as well give up the fight!
Live it up tonight!

No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!

Life a beautiful and fragile thing,
Floating in the galaxy,
I'm gonna let it set me free.
Now is all we really ever have,
Open your eyes and don't look back,
Now give me something to believe.

'Cause no one's getting out alive!
All the gold on Earth, it won't buy time!
So we might as well give up the fight!
Live it up tonight!

No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!

(Huh, if-, br-br-breathe, huh).

So no one's getting out alive!
All the gold on Earth, it won't buy time!
So we might as well give up the fight!
Live it up tonight!

No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive!
No one's getting out alive! ---
