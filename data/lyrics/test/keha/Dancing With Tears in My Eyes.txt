here we go 
welcome to my funeral
without you 
i dont really have a pulse
all alone its dark and cold 
with every move i die

here i go 
this is my confession 
no i lost cause
nobody can save my soul
i am so delusional
with every move i die

i have destroyed my life
its gone
pay back is sick
its all my fault

Im dancing with tears in my eyes
just fighting to get through the night
im losing it
losing it
losing it
with every move i die

im fading
im broken inside
ive wasted the love from my life 
im losing it
losing it
losing it
with every move i die

when did i 
become such a hipacrit
double life 
lies that you caught me in
trust me im paying for it
with every move i die

on the floor 
im just a zombie
who i am 
is not who i wanna be
im such a tradgey
with every move i die

i have destroyed my love
its gone
pay back is sick
its all my fault

Im dancing with tears in my eyes
just fighting to get through the night
im losing it
losing it
losing it
losing it
with every move i die

im fading
im broken inside
ive wasted the love from my life 
im losing it
losing it
losing it
losing it
with every move i die

woah oh
this is it 
and now your really gone
this time
oh oh

never once thought
id be in pieces left behind
hind hind hind hind hind hind hind
hind hind hind hind hind hind hind

Im dancing with tears in my eyes
just fighting to get through the night
im losing it
losing it
losing it
losing it
with every move i die

im fading
im broken inside
ive wasted the love from my life 
im losing it
losing it
losing it
losing it
with every move i die---Lyrics submitted by katie.
