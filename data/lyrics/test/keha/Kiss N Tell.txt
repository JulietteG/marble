Listen to yourself, you're a hot mess
St-st-stutter through your words, breaking a sweat
What's it gonna take to confess
We both know
Yeah, I was outta town last weekend
You were feeling like a pimp 'round your lame friends
Now your little party's gonna end
So here we go

Woohha-a-ohooh, you got a secret
Woohha-a-ohooh, you couldnt keep it
Woohha-a-ohooh, somebody leaked it
And now some sh*ts about to go down

I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldnt, aahoo, kiss n tell
You really shouldve kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldnt, aahoo
Kiss n tell

You're looking like a tool not a bawler
You're acting like a chick, why bother?
I can find someone way hotter
With a bigger...well
Cause Im done with all the ways thats you've messed up
You werent smart enough to keep your stupid mouth shut
I'm so sick of it, Ive had enough
I hope you cry

Woohha-a-ohooh, you got a secret
Woohha-a-ohooh, you couldnt keep it
Woohha-a-ohooh, somebody leaked it
And now some sh*ts about to go down

I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldnt, aahoo, kiss n tell
You really shouldve kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldnt, aahoo
Kiss n tell

Kiss n tell (x8)

Aooh, I hope you know
You gotta go
Yo, get up and go
I dont wanna know
Or why your gross
You gotta go
You, get up and go
Cause I don't wanna know

I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut but when I was gone
Maybe you shouldnt, aahoo, kiss n tell
You really shouldve kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldnt, aahoo,
Kiss n tell

Maybe you shouldnt, aahoo,
Kiss n tell---Lyrics submitted by Ciara.
