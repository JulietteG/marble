Last night I had enough of you
I put on the brakes
And I could tell you took it hard
It was all over your face

That you were slippin' and flippin'
But here is the sitch
I signed up for a man 
But you are just a bitch

You should know
I that I love 
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag

When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking bout you non stop

But you cried about this
And whined about that
When you grow a pear 
You can call me back

Yeah I think you're hot
I think you're alright
But you're acting like a chick all time

You were cool
And now you're not
Just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

When I first met you
Panties dropping
Every time saw you
It was on and

One day you asked
If we could just talk
And that's the reason
Why I'm walking

If I am honest
I'm just not hooked on your phonics
I'm not trying to be rude or crude
I just wanted one thing from you and you got confused

You should know
That I love 
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag

When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking bout you non stop

But you cried bout this
And whined bout that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Yeah I think you're hot
I think you're alright
But you're acting like a chick all the time

You were cool 
But now you're not
Just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

When you grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

When you grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Oh
Grow a pear
You can call me back

And no I don't want to see your mangina

When you grow a pear
You can call me back

When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking bout you non stop

But you cried about this
And whined about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Yeah I think you're hot
I think you're alright
But you're acting like a chick all the time

You were cool
And now you're not just like that
When you grow a pair
You can call me back---Lyrics submitted by Shailene Gomez.
