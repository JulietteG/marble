[Chorus:]
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R
You are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R
You are a dinosaur
O-L-D M-A-N
Your just an old man
Hitting on me what?
You need a cat scan

[Verse 1:]
Old man, why are you starin' at me, mack on me and my friends?
It's kinda a creepy
You should be prowling around the Old folk's home
Come on dude!
Leave us alone

At first we thought that it was kind of ill when
We saw that you were like a billion
And still out tryin' to make a killin'
Get back to the museum

[Chorus:]
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R
You are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R
You are a dinosaur
O-L-D M-A-N
Your just an old man
Hitting on me what?
You need a cat scan

Hey dinosaur, baby you're pre-historic
Hey dinosaur, that's what you are HA
Hey carnivore, you want my meat I know it
Hey dinosaur, that's what you are HA
Yea, you're pretty old

[Verse 2:]
Not long til' your a senior citizen
And you can strut around with that sexy tank of oxygen
Honey your toupee is fallin' to your left side
Get up and go bro!
Oh wait your fossilized HA!

Then you offered me a martini
Walk away with your hips with in sinking
Then you say, "Honey wanna come with me"
I'm about to barf seriously

[Chorus:]
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R
You are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R
You are a dinosaur
O-L-D M-A-N
Your just an old man
Hitting on me what?
You need a cat scan

Hey dinosaur
baby, you're prehistoric
Hey dinosaur
That's what you are HA!
Hey carnivore
you want my meat, I know it
Hey dinosaur
That's what you are HA!

Hey dinosaur baby,
you're prehistoric
Hey dinosaur
That's what you are HA!
Hey carnivore
you want my meat, I know it
Hey dinosaur
That's what you are HA!

D-I-N-O-S-A
You are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A
That's what you are HA!
D-I-N-O-S-A
You are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A
That's what you are HA! ---Lyrics submitted by Kitty.
