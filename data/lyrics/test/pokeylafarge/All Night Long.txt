What kinda gal can you be?
You just haunt my memory
All night long, honey, all night long

No matter what I say or do
I can't stop thinkin' of you
All night long, honey, all night long

When I stay awake an cry all night
You know they call it a sin
But they don't seem to know
The fix you've got me in

How can you be so mean to me?
Yeah!
After doin' what you did to me?
All night long, honey, all night long

'Get outta here boy, your dog does'

When I stay awake an cry all night
You know they call it a sin
Yeah!
But they don't seem to know
The fix you've got me in
Yeah!

Oh, how can you be so mean to me?
After doin' what you did to me?
All night long, oh baby, all night long---
