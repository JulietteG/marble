Well, I was laying in the dark
When I felt a spark, suddenly come over me
As the feeling got stronger
I could no longer, get myself back to sleep
The melody was flowing, and the rhythm started growing
I, guess it had to be from my soul
Cause if it feels right, its like love at first sight
When it hits you, then you know

Its the spark, when you get it, you know you got it
Its the spark, when you dont know you want it
Yes, you know you gotta have the spark

I started buzzin like a phone
Rattling my bones, and shaking dust off my wings
I set my eyes towards the sky, as the sun started to rise
I was so high, I thought I could fly
And I just might dare, but my baby might care
Disturbing her at such a time
Ill keep it close to the vest till I can get it off my chest
And sing it with a friend of mine

Yes, you know you gotta have the spark
Mmm, you know you gotta have the spark---
