Keep your angel wings on tight, babe
Wear your halo proudly, too
You can try your best to behave
But I know you have the devil inside of you

My mom said that she thought you were part angel and part saint
But youre quite used to convincing people of everything you aint
Youre a bad girl, youre a bad girl
Soon theyll all be on to you

You can wear white to your wedding
Ask the preacher to bless your soul
But when you see St. Peter at them pearly gates
You wont have what it takes to pay the toll

Youre a bad girl, youre a bad girl
Soon theyll all be on to you
Youre a bad girl, youre a bad girl
Soon theyll all be on to you

Oh, keep your angel wings on tight, babe
Yes thats what an evil girl would do
Youre just a bad girl
Thats what an evil girl would do
Youre a bad girl---
