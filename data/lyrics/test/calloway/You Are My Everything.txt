There are songs I must sing to you
there are melodies
sounding oh so sweet inside my solitude
there are rhymes there are remedies 
for a lonely heart
May we never part  for what we have is true

Don't you know that time is as endless as forever
so each day i love you just a little more

You are my everything
You are my hopes and my dreams
You are my everything
so each day i love you just a little more

there are sounds form a symphony
trickily fill the air
and when you're not there
my world is feeling blue

with the dawn comes the morning
i see the sun
you're the only one to turn my gray skies blue

don't you know that love's
like an ocean overflowing
i would send you kiss each time 
you walk the shore

Can't you see that time is as endless as forever
so each day i love you just a little more

You are my everything
You are my hopes and my dreams
You are my everything
so each day i love you just a little more---Lyrics submitted by Joan Kristine.
