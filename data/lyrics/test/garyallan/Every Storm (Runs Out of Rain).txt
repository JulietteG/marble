I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning 
I know you're feeling like you just can't win, but you're trying 
It's hard to keep on keepin' on, when you're being pushed around 
Don't even know which way is up, just keep spinning down, 'round, down 

Every storm runs, runs out of rain 
Just like every dark night turns into day 
Every heartache will fade away 
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain 

So hold your head up and tell yourself that there's something more 
Walk out that door 
Go find a new rose, don't be afraid of the thorns 
'Cause we all have thorns 
Just put your feet up to the edge, put your face in the wind 
And when you fall back down, keep on rememberin' 

Every storm runs, runs out of rain 
Just like every dark night turns into day 
Every heartache will fade away 
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain 

It's gonna run out of pain 
It's gonna run out of sting 
It's gonna leave you alone 
It's gonna set you free 
Set you free 

Every storm runs, runs out of rain 
Just like every dark night turns into day 
Every heartache will fade away 
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain 

It's gonna set you free, 
It's gonna run out of pain, 
It's gonna set you free ---
