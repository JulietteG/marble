Well, Ive seen that look a thousand times
And I know that sparkle in your eyes
And I know what it means tonight
Thats the dress you wore when we first met
And it always means you wanna let
Your hair down, aw, and you just might
Ive never seen you look so happy
Never looked so good in love

Chorus:
When I look into your eyes I still get weak
And when Im this close to you, I just cant speak
And its hard to keep my hands to myself
When I know I could never love anybody else
Youre all I want, youre all I need
And its so damn hard to believe
Thats you without me

Thats your third glass of chardonnay
And he sure seems to know his way
In what to do and what to say
Well, its obvious that youve moved on
Im still getting past you being gone
And hes going home with you tonight

Chorus:
When I look into your eyes I still get weak
And when Im this close to you, I just cant speak
And its hard to keep my hands to myself
When I know I could never love anybody else
Youre all I want, youre all I need
And its so damn hard to believe
Thats you without me

Dont think youve ever looked more beautiful
And youve never been more gone

When i look into your eyes I still get weak
And when Im this close to you, I just cant speak
And its hard to keep my hands to myself
When I know I could never love anybody else
Youre all I want, youre all I need
And its so damn hard to believe, I cant believe
Thats you without me

Thats you without me---
