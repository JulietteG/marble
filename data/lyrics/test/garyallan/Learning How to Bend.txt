still learning how to pray
trying hard not to stray
try to see things your way
still learning how to pray
still learning how to trust
so hard to open up
and i'd do anything for us
still learning how to trust

still learning how to bend
how to let you in
in a world full of tears
will conquer all our fears
still learning how to fly
i wanna take you high
ill be there till the end
ill be your lover and your friend
still learning how to bend

im just trying to understand 
its all in someone elses hands
its allways been a bigger plan
i dont need to understand

[chorus]

ill be there till the end
ill be yout lover and your friend
still learning how to bend 

still learning how to bend
ill be there till the end
still learning how to bend.---Lyrics submitted by cassidy.
