Your eyes are gonna drown in your wine glass
Your mind is skippin' stones over your past
I know better than to ask you, why love?

When you begin to believe your own lies then
They'll keep swingin' long as you keep fightin'
Until you ruin a perfectly good night, my love

My love, you're not listening
My love, you're not listening
My love, try listening
For the voice that's whispering
To you, my love

Those tears are ten years old
That script has long been sold
That story's sick of bein' told
Say good bye, love

It's time you learned some new lines
They're already rollin' 'round in your mind
So don't waste another life, my love

My love, you're not listening
My love, you're not listening
My love, try listening
For the voice that's whispering
To you, my love

[bridge]

My love, my love
My love, you're not listening
My love, you're not listening

My dreams did not come true
The way I wanted them to
And that's okay with me
Is it okay with you?

My dreams did not come true
The way I wanted them to
An' that's okay with me
Is it okay with you?

[/bridge]

My love, try listening
For the voice that's whispering
To you, my love---Lyrics submitted by Trent Elko.
