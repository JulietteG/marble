So at my show on Monday
I was told that someday
You'd be on your way to better things
It's not about your make-up
Or how you try to shape up
To these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams honey

So now you pour your heart out
You're telling me you're far out
You're all about to lie down for your cause
But you don't pull my strings
Cause I'm a better man
Moving on to better things

But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day

And at the show on Tuesday
She was in her mindset
Tempered firs and spangled boots
Looks are deceiving
Making me believe it
And these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams honey, yeah

So won't you go far
Tell me you're a keeper
You're all about to lie down for your cause
But you don't pull my strings because
Cause I'm a better man
Moving on to better things

But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day

Yes our wish's that we never made it
Through all the summers
We kept them up instead of
Kicking us back down to the suburbs
Yes our wish's that we never made it
Through all the summers
We kept them up instead of
Kicking us back down to the suburbs

But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day

But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day---Lyrics submitted by Tracey.
