If you get yourself in a fight
If that's the way you wanna live your life
You can get yourself connected
To the world that we don't do here

But all I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my head on
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I want someone to be
And someone to drive around town
I need someone to love
When the chips are down

Love me when the chips are down
Will you love me when the chips are down?
Love me when the chips are down
Could you love me
When the world is crashing all around?

You can try and be someone you're not
If that's the rift that you wanna cause
You can do the life of a bohemian
Or you can choose the material world

But all I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my head on
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I need someone to be
And someone to drive around town
I need someone to love
When the chips are down

Love me when the chips are down
Will you love me when the chips are down?
Love me when the chips are down
Could you love me
When the world is crashing all around?

All around

All I need is somewhere to lay
Somewhere to lay my head on
I need someone to love in the middle of the day
I want someone to be
And someone to drive around town
I need someone to love
To love, to love

Love me when the chips are down
Will you love me when the chips are down?
Love me when the chips are down
Could you love me
When the chips are down
Could you love me
When the world is crashing all around?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
