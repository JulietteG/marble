Can i hold you one last time,
to fight the fear that is growing in my mind.
i know i did us both so wrong,
 i know i'm not always all that strong.

a, b, c, d ,e ,f and g, 
Oh, that reminds me of when we were free,
before life begain to tear us apart,
remember those classes when we thought we were smart. 

We were lovers in every way.
Left school together went back to my place,
now i can hardly remember her face,
before i met her i was sad.

can i hold you one last time,
to fight this fear that is growing in my mind---Lyrics submitted by kyle.
