I must say that I worry for 
You can't live like this no more
imust say that i worry for you

I must say that I worry for
You can't live like this no more
Imyus say that I worry for you

Took Me by surprise
That I just didn't see
She hat a dark parst, her broken heart
And she wants it loved

But in the darkest of time
She won't be honest whit lies
Put her words in a fancy dress
And we'll keep up this disguise

But no longer
It's not getting stronger
Nolongre longre for me

I must say that I worry for 
You can't live like this no more
i must say that I worry for you

But you, but you don't wanna think no more
Passed out on your bedroom floor
I must say that I worry for you

Took me bu surprise 
A man once make a key
To open her dark heart
He broke apart what was once in love

But it's clear now to see
That man, he was me
And so I far, far
Without her, don't you follow me

And no longer
We're not getting longer
No longre for me

I must say that i worry for 
You can't live like this no more
I must say that I worry for you

I must say that I worry for 
Our love in this cold war
I must say that I worry for you

I worry for you
I worry for you
I worry for you
I worry for you

I'm just saying that I worry for
I'm just saying that I worry for
I'm just saying that I worry for 
And I'm just saying that I worry for
