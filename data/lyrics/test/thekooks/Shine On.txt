Safety pins holding up the things 
That make you mine
About your hair, you needn't care,
You look beautiful all the time.

Shine, shine, shine on
Yes,
Won't you shine, shine on
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Won't you shine, shine on

Your magazines people like it seems
But you still read
I must admit I don't believe in it
But I see how You get sucked in

Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Won't you shine, shine on
(Sha la la la)
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Won't you shine, shine on
Because your not done

Why do you bite the hand that feeds you
Why do you
Why do you bite the hand that feeds...you!

Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Won't you shine, shine on
(Sha la la la)
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Won't you shine, shine on

Safety pins holding up the things
That make you mine
About your hair, you needn't care
You look beautiful all of the time.---Lyrics submitted by Ruby.
