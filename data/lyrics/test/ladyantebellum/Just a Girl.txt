Boy, you must have come up short tonight
Cause I'm always your consolation prize
Usually I fix my hair, put on my coat
And show up at your door, but no more

Now I know I'm just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no pastime, this is gonna be the last time
Just a call when there's nowhere else to fall
Just a number on your wall and a pretty dress and curves
To you I'm just a girl, to you I'm just a girl

I was always taught to sit up straight
Find a man before it gets too late
Give him time to make his mind
But I can't be the one you string along
Like some old sad song

Now I know I'm just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no pastime, this is gonna be the last time
Just a call when there's nowhere else to fall
Just a number on your wall and a pretty dress and curves
To you I'm just a girl, to you I'm just a girl

To you I'm just a girl
Talking through the static, just a girl
To you I'm just dramatic, just a girl
Just a silly lil thing, that's all you've ever seen
When there's so much more to me

Now I know I'm just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no pastime, this is gonna be the last

Now I know I'm just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no pastime, this is gonna be the last time
Just a call when there's nowhere else to fall
Just a number on your wall and a pretty dress and curves
To you I'm just a girl, to you I'm just a girl ---
