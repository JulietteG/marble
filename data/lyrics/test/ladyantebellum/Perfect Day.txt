Been walkin' through the town just the other day with nothing much to do,
    As the sun came breakin' down through the clouds,
    I've never seen the sky so blue.
    I saw a cajun man with a red guitar singin' on the side of the street, 
    I threw a hand full of change in his beat up case and said play me a country beat.
   And it sounded like....

   Met up with some friends outside of town,
   They were headed towards the lake,
   I hopped into the back of a jacked up jeep, 
   Felt the wind upon my face,
   We got to the spot and the sun was hot,
   Everybody was feelin' fine, 
   So we jumped on in for a mid-day swim and we lost all track of time


      It was the perfect day,
      What I'd give if I could find a way to stay, 
      Lost in this moment.
      Now, Aint' worried 'bout tommorrow,
      When you're busy living in a perfect day.

   As the moon came out and the fire burned everybody was singin' along,
   To some Ramblin' Man, 
   A little Curtis Loew,
   And all them feel good songs,
   We danced all night without a care,
   No place we'd rather be,
   'Cause these are the days we'll talk about,
   When we lived so wild and free.

       It was the perfect day,
       What I'd give if I could find a way to stay,
       Lost in this moment,
       Now, Aint' worried 'bout tommorrow,
       When you're busy living in a perfect day.

   We were sittin' in the sand as he grabbed my hand and leaned in for a kiss,
   I couldn't help but think that the stars above it don't get much better than this.

       It was the perfect day,
       What I'd give if I could find a way to stay,
       Lost in this moment,
       Now, Ain't worried 'bout tommorrow,
       When you're busy living, 
       Feels like dreaming, 
       Slowing driftin' through this perfect day.---Lyrics submitted by Liz.
