Your hit initial fire and ice
You're water and whisky burn
We kiss, we fight, make up all night
You're the blessing and the curse

But I don't ever wanna break this chain
I don't ever wanna walk away
Cuz I ain't ever gonna find another lover
Make me feel this way
Over and over and over we say that we're through
But I come right back to you

There's a long stretch of love
Coming down the line
Have you like I want, ever rolling
Baby, you'll be mine
Have you right here, beside you
When you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love

You lift me up, you bring me down
You make me feel alive
You send my heart in overdrive
Every time you kill the lights
Over and over and over we play this game
Win or lose, we never change

There's a long stretch of love
Coming down the line
Have you like I want, ever rolling
Baby, you'll be mine
Have you right here, beside you
When you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love

Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Over and over and over we play this game
Win or lose, we never change

There's a long stretch of love
Coming down the line
Have you like I want, ever rolling
Baby, you'll be mine
Have you right here, beside you
When you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of love---
