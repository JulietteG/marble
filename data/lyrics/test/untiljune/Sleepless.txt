Ooooooo ( x4 )

Oh when you were young,
did you ever love someone,
so much you couldn't even bear the thought of loosing 'em.
Well I remember the sleepless nights,
when I'll ough you wake,
before I could tell you how I feel.

***Refrain***
(oooooo...)
Sleepless Nights...
(oooooo...)
Well I remember the Sleepless Nights...
(oooooo...)
Sleepless at Night... (end of refrain)

Well I would walk around the earth,
to have another chance with you,
spending evening painful thoughts of all that you do.
Well I remember the sleepless nights,
when I'll ough you wake,
before I could tell you how I feel.

***Refrain***

Have you ever loved someone...
Hard to find...
Have you ever loved someone...
Could you ever love someone...
Oh nooo...

Ooooooo ( x4 )

Well I remember the sleepless nights,
when I'll ough you wake,
it's been on my own...
(oooooo...)

Well I remember the sleepless nights,
when I'll ough you wake,
it's been on my own...
(oooooo...)

Well I remember the sleepless nights,
when I'll ough you wake,
it's been on my own...
(oooooo...)

Well I remember the sleepless nights,
when I'll ough you wake,
before I could tell you how I feel. (end)---Lyrics submitted by Dimitris.
