My heart breaks, it's quivering
When I stare into the sky and I know that I am part of this
Unfolding into beauty, my eyes steam with tears, rainbow ribbons grace the ground
I have died a thousands times, I have breathed a million breaths, but it has taken me this long to be present
It's taken an eternity to see this evidence
"Wisdom tells me I am nothing, my heart tells me I am everything
Somewhere between the two my life flows"

There's a beating in my heart I haven't felt in years
Thirst drove me to water where I drank from the moonlight
And now I'm free

My soul is from elsewhere, I'm sure of that
Surrender and empty myself of the past
Cause refuge is waiting in the moment

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender

Don't let your heartbeat turn to stone
There is a way out
Don't let your heartbeat turn to stone
There is a way out
Don't let your heartbeat turn to stone
There is a way out
Don't let your heartbeat turn to stone
There is a way out

There is so much peace that you can have, once you see, we are not as separate as you may think
The worlds an ocean and youre a wave; we are the ocean made up of intersecting waves
There is so much love and so much kindness
There is so much hope, someday youll find it
Take the armor off your heart and let it beat---
