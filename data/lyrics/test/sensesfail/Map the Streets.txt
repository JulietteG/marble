If I fall or trip back into love Im gonna bring a ladder and gloves,
So I can climb right back out if there is ever even a shred of doubt.
Im gonna bring a flashlight too and leave a trail and stick to the plan,
You can get real lost down there if youre not sure,
Of the foreign territory there are times when the path gets blurry and the wrong turn feels right.

But who would want me anyway?
Im a lush with broken parts of paper mache.
I have nothing left to give, I dont think I ever did.	

There are times when I wish that someone would help me find the person I was,
Or give me a detailed map of the streets spelling out the traffic patterns in beeps.
I am finding safety in lines, they are painted so they can guide.
Empty tanks and broken wheels take me home.
Right now I find myself dangling on the edge trying not to fall in back to where I came from.

But who would want me anyway?
Im a lush with broken parts of paper mache.
I have nothing left to give, I dont think I ever did.

I dove in way too deep with rocks tied to me,
I should have had a plan cause now these ropes wont come free
I do not have faith if I did then I would feel safe,
I would wait here for fate but its conveniently late.
The bottom is a place that I know too well.

So who would want me anyway?
Im a lush with broken parts and Ill never change.
I have nothing left to give, I dont think I ever did.

I wish that I could find the person that I was,
I always thought that Id be happy if I was loved,
But I have nothing left to give I dont think I ever did.---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
