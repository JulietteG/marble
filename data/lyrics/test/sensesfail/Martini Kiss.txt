There's poison in my drinking glass, don't stop just sip it down
and in a swirling masquerade of style my body hits the ground.
I'm beautiful when I'm asleep.
Martini kisses land on my blistered bloody scarlet lips.
The bottles in my hand.

Burn out, not fade away. [x6]

I'll speak in riddles so you can understand.
I'll draw in pencil so you can trace with pen.
So in love with me, like shaped you would be.
I'll write both our names into the wet concrete.

We're glistening like silver spoons, beneath the summer night.
Oh, can you smell the suttle winter frost as the flowers start to pry.
The autumn winds are bringing grapes to all the emerald trees.
They're so beautiful and dead, just make their colors slowly bleed.

Burn out, not fade away. [x6]

I'll speak in riddles so you can understand.
I'll draw in pencil so you can trace with pen.
So in love with me, like shaped you would be.
I'll write both our names into the wet concrete.

The pawns will fade away
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
The king and his check mate
Burn out, not fade away
Burn out, not fade away
And I sit here with the secret
Choking at the laughter till I die

Burn out, not fade away [x4]---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
