We all struggle to breathe sometimes
We all just want to feel alive

I just get so damn scared at night
That I won't be the person who I should

This life is so fragile, we can break in two
We can face the truth with grace and choose to lose our hardened views

One day I will be gone
But all the things that I have done will remain
They will remain
My actions remain
My actions remain

There is nothing sadder than an unlived life
You cannot run from the things you hide
You must turn and face the fear inside
There is nothing sadder than an unlived life

We are all longing for compassion
We are all longing for acceptance
There is nothing that shows more strength
Than meeting pain with compassion
Because we all have wounded hearts
We are just as blind in the dark
And we all quiver in fear
When the ones we love disappear

But the love they gave us, it stays here
But the love they showed us, it stays here
But the love they gave us, it stays here---
