Sometimes I try to do things and it just doesn't work out the way I want it to.
And I get real frustrated, and like, I try hard to do it I like take my time and it doesn't work out the way I want it to.
It's like I concentrate real hard and it just doesn't work out
and everything I do and everything I try it never turns out
It's like I need time to figure these things out
But there's always someone there going
Hey buddy:
You know we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately.
You know, you need to maybe get away and like maybe you should talk about it, you'll feel a lot better
And I go:
No it's okay, you know I'll figure it out, just leave me alone I'll figure it out. You know I'll just work it out myself.
And they go:
Well you know if you want to talk about it I'll be here you know and you'll probably feel a lot better if you talk about it. so why don't you talk about it
And I go:
No I don't want to talk about it I'm okay, I'll figure it out myself and they just keep bugging me and they just keep bugging me and it builds up inside
So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have any say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way.
I'm not crazy - institutionalized
You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
I was in my room and I was like just sitting there staring at the wall thinking about everything
But then again I was thinking about nothing
And then my mom came in and I didn't even realize she was there
And she calls my name
But I didn't even hear her, and then she started screaming: BUDDY! BUDDY!
And I go:
What, what's the matter
And she goes:
What's the matter with you?
I go:
There's nothing wrong mom.
And she goes:
Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!
And I go:
Mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, why don't you get me a Pepsi.
And she goes:
NO you're on drugs!
I go:
Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking.
She goes:
No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't act that way!
I go:
Mom just give me a Pepsi please
All I want is a Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me.
Just a Pepsi.
They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around you're back, you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy
I'm not crazy - institutionalized
You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
I was sitting in my room and my mom and my dad came in and they pulled up a chair and they sat down, and they go:
Buddy, we need to talk to you
And I go:
Okay what's the matter
They go:
Me and your mom we've been noticing lately that you've been having a lot of problems,
and you've been going off for no reason and we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody,
We're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself.
So we decided that it would be in your best interest if we put you somewhere
Where you could get the help that you need.
And I go:
Wait, what are you talking about, WE decided!?
MY best interest?! How can you know what's MY best interest is?
How can you say what MY best interest is? What are you trying to say, I'M crazy?
When I went to YOUR schools, when I went to YOUR churches,
when I went to YOUR institutional learning facilities?! So how can you say I'm crazy.
They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead
I'm not crazy - institutionalized
You're the one who's crazy - institutionalized
You're driving me crazy - institutionalized
They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself
It doesn't matter I'll probably get hit by a car anyway.---Lyrics submitted by 'Nessa.
