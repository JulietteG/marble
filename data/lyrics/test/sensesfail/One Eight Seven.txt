We're so nice sitting very still,
in a room where no one else can feel, 
the pain that breaks my heart each day 
I'm not ok.
Sunlight shining through my window, let's me know that I'm still alive
But why did I ever let you inside my heart? 
I'm such a fool.
I paint my face in shades of blood and grey 
and take a seat right next to me
But I should have known that you were a killer.
But now I'm dead.

A gaping hole, shot through my heart
A lost connection from your poison dart
Shot from your tounge to end my life.
But If your Blowing at the fire to light your strife.

You'll never know, oh yeah, you'll never know, oh no.
The hardest thing about dying is, knowing you'll never see the light of day.

A gaping hole...(shot through my heart)
A lost connection from your poison dart.
My head now spins and my ears bleed gold.
I try so fucking hard, but I can't fit your mold.

The hardest thing about dying is, knowing you'll never see the light of day.
The hardest thing about dying is, knowing you'll never see the light of day.

You ripped my heart out, you tore my eyes out, now you're gonna pay.
I'll stab you one time.
I'll eat your heart out, so you feel my pain.
Don't you know that I always see you in all of my dreams?

I wanna kill you.
I wanna kill you now.
I'm insane.
