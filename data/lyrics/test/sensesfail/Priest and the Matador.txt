Here I lie
Staring At
Clouds IN Shapes of
dogs and cats
I hear a woman
Start to yell
"Oh dear God, I think he fell"

I'm the arrow,
Shot straight to hell
From the bow of William Tell.
My body lies
Kissing the ground
Like a cross turned upside down.

A priest is rushing
To my side,
Begins to read me
My last rites.
Father you're too late
My faith is weak
So won't you save your
half-hearted speech.

I'm the arrow,
Shot straight to hell
From the bow of William Tell.
My body lies
Kissing the ground
Like a cross turned upside down.

A man bends down and says,
"Son, we're going to get through this one
take my hand and let us pray..."
I scream, "Please get the fuck away."

I'm the arrow,
Shot straight to hell
From the bow of William Tell.
My body lies
Kissing the ground
Like a cross turned upside down.

The ambulance is singing
As cops push back the crowd
I start to take my last breath,
As blood pours out my mouth.
The medics WALKING my way
I think this could be it.
I hear them start to state
The time of death is half past six.

I'm the arrow,
Shot straight to hell [x2]---Lyrics submitted by Will.
