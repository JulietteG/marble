You could say one of two thing:
Call me sometime or let's hang out.
Or maybe I could help you out.

Stop acting like you'll ever see me again,
And like I don't have you figured out.

I understand how it works.
On paper, we are similar people.
I understand how it works.
On paper, we are similar people.

But we're different people.
Yeah we're different people.

You are tearing down the walls I
Built until they scraped the sky.
So tell your wrecking crew,
I welcome you.

When the days slow down this summer don't forget.
I spent two years in your silhouette.
Your jaws of steel never forgave.
It's haunting, the way silence sounded.
If I fucked up long ago,
I'm sorry, I didn't realize it counted.
I didn't realize it counted.
I didn't realize it counted.

It just wouldn't work out,
That's what I am telling myself.
That we're just two different people.---
