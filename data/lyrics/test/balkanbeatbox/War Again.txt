Here we are like we're gonna get war again
Coming hard, come and get a gun, join the gang
With the bang bang and the same song we sang
Comin over and over again

It's peaking up now, getting more like a game
And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But you can always tell your better half

Always tell your better half of the story
It goes well with the better side of your face u show on TV
Give me a good reason why I shouldn't start a revolution
What's in the constitution? Is this illusion that we buy?
U cut the wings and then u say fly
U say the hero is the one that died
But the true hero is the one who doesn't live a lie and understands
That there's an end out of the cycle
Who's the master? Who's the disciple?
U can do what u can, but will u do it again?
So what's the plan?
Looks like we are gonna get war again

Here we are like we're gonna get war again
Coming hard, come and get a gun, join the gang
With the bang bang and the same song we sang
Coming over and over again

It's peaking up now, getting more like a game
And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But u can always tell your better half

Look out
Gonna get war again, gonna get wrong again
Gone again, with the same song again, on again
Can't be born again, who's gone again?
Who's going to gain out of this war again?
Hooligan in a tie rule again
Soon again u will see it all begin again
Sink again, and that will make u think again

And when they call u go
When they are wrong u know
And u will follow, and u will swallow
Again like long ago the bomb will blow
So sit back relax and enjoy the show
Cuz' u are as cold as snow and I am here below
I'm going to speak out, scream out
Here we go, got the fresh flow
So before it's over
Then u are gonna  find a different kind of war to start again

gonna get war again
gonna get war again
gonna get war again---Lyrics submitted by Paco Melito.
