The memories of an old man
are the deeds of a man in his prime
you shuffle at the pool in a sick room
and talk to your self as you die

and life is a short warm moment
and death is a long cold rest
you'll get your chance to try at 80 years
with luck even less

so all aboard for thee american tour
and maybe you'll make it to the top
so mind how you go
i can tell you 'cuz i know
you may find it hard to get off

you are the angel of death 
and i am the dead mans son
he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
and everyones still on the run

and who is the master of fox hounds
and who says the hunt has begun
and who calls the tune in a courtroom
and who beats the funeral drum

The memories of an old man
are the deeds of a man in his prime
you shuffle at the pool in a sick room
and talk to your self as you die---Lyrics submitted by Thor.
