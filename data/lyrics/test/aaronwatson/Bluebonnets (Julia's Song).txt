In another time and place
Grandma would kiss my face
Wish I could go back there again
I'd climb up in my Grandpa's lap
I'd lay down and take a nap
That old man and me were best friends

And one day I turned around
Leaves are fallin', fallin' down
Those fields were bare and brown
And they were gone

Long gone like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack like and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring.

There's so much I can't explain
Such as gravity and pain
Still I remain, blindfolded and full of faith
I kissed my angel girl goodbye
Still can't help but wonder why
But I believe I'll see her again someday

So, hold 'em tender, hold 'em tight
Pray every mornin', day, and night
That God will help you raise them right
And don't you blink, don't blink

'Cause like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the Spring

Life can be filled full of sorrow
Time is something you can't borrow
So love like there's no tomorrow
Because today could the day

Like bluebonnets in the spring
We're only here for a little while
It's beautiful and bittersweet
So make the most of every mile
So pack light and love heavy
Give it all your heart and soul
So in the end you won't regret one thing
Life is like bluebonnets in the spring

Life is like bluebonnets in the spring---
