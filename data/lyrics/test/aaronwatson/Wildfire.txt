Rivers strong, you cant swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moons so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Cause a little bit of summers what the whole years all about

Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say aint this been some kind of day
You and me been catchin on like a wildfire

Dont get up just to get another you can drink from mine
We cant leave each other
We can dance with the dead, you can rest your head on my shoulder, If you wanna get older with me
Cause a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say aint this been some kind of day
You and me been catchin on like a wildfire

Instrumental break

Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say aint this been some kind of day
You and me been catchin on like a wildfire

Girl you look fine, fine fine, put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say aint this a blessed kind of day
You and me been catchin on like a wildfire
