And there you go giving that eye
With your hand on my thigh
You got me swerving all over the place
You got me wanting and needing
You're the reason for my speeding
And you know you can blame it on the brakes

Blame it on those baby blues
For looking like you do
Blame it on your slow dancing
County row romancing
Blame it on the moonlight shining bright
Tailgate kinda summer night
Blame it on you for loving me so true
Girl, you can blame it on your smile
Whisper and your touch
Blame it on your lips for kissing me so much
Blame it on those baby blues
But you can't blame me for loving you

And when the sun goes down
On a sleepy little town
You turn my world into a country love song
Take a good long look in the mirror
And all couldn't be any clearer
And you'll see what turns my radio on

The way you love me
Can't get enough of me
Rain and shine all the time
We thought your heart soul
I'll be looking in your eyes
By the time the sun rise
Comes shining through your bedroom window

No, no matter what you do
Girl, you can't blame me for loving you

You can blame it on those baby blues
For looking like you do---
