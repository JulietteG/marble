The last thing I wanna do right now is read your stupid poetry

Why can't you just tell me what you really wanna say?

You'd clear your conscience with words so weak and empty

But something in your eyes gave you away

And i've been lonely like a silhouette or a serenade

A heart attack or a man betrayed

The arms of love been holding me like a silhouette or a serenade

Is this all you have to say this broken boy would hang on every word

You tell me that you need me while I slowly fall apart

You'd heal your heartache with words so cool and callous

But the absence of your tears gave you away

And I've been lonely like a silhouette or a serenade

A heart attack or a man betrayed

The arms of love been holding me like a silhouette or a serenade

And all pretty poems have to end

So I say this before I leave

If words are your weapons my dear I surrender, surrender

silhouette or a serenade

A heart attack or a man betrayed

The arms of love been holding me to you---Lyrics submitted by Terry.
