Jesus Christ, will You guide me
Through this life?
Wake me
With each morning's light
Oh and keep my soul

Through your strength
All my fears will fade away
As You lead me in Your ways
I will trust in You

Your love is deep
Your love is wide
I will rest in Your arms tonight
Your love is deep
Your love is wide
I will rest, I will rest
Tonight

All I see
Is Your beauty chasing me
Oh the love that sets me free
I am found in You

Your love is deep
Your love is wide
I will rest in Your arms tonight
Your love is deep
Your love is wide
I will rest, I will rest
Tonight

Your love is deep
Your love is wide
I will rest in Your arms tonight
Your love is deep
Your love is wide
I will rest, I will rest
Tonight, tonight

Lay Your peace
Like a blanket over me
And as I lay down to sleep
I will rest in You---
