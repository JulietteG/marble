Sometimes people
A man can be wrong
And sometimes people, the same man can stand back up, get back up
and be strong

Now I don't claim to be no preacher
And experience is my only teacher
But tell me who we thank for a life this long

Well,
He let me love, let me love, let me love
Again
Oh yes He did now
Life has sure been good to me

Well people once
Once I had a true love
Or so I thought
You know somethin'?
YOU can't change nobody
No ya can't they won't be bought
Now lovesick played on my heartstrings
I knew I had to find myself a brand new thing
I said a prayer that Mary might recall
Well
He let me love, let me love, let me love
Again Oh yes He did now life has sure been good to me
You know that life has sure been good to me
I tell you this life, this one has sure been good for me....---Lyrics submitted by Sue Anderson.
