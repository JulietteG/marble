(Woh-oh-oh-oh, {wa-ah-ah,} oh-oh-oh-oh.)

Earth angel, earth angel, will you be mine?
My darling dear, love you all the time.
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.
(Wa-ah-ah, wa-ah.)

Earth angel, earth angel, (wa-oh-oh-oh,)
the one i adore . (Ahhh.)
love you you forever, and ever more.
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo.)

I fell for you and I knew,
The vision of your love's loveliness.
I hope and I pray that someday,
I'll be the vision of your hap-happiness.
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, OH!)

Earth angel, earth angel, (wa-oh-oh-oh,)

My darling dear, love you all the time.
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.
(Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo.)

I fell for you and I knew,
The vision of your loveliness.
I hope and pray that someday,
That I'll be the vision of your happiness.
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.)

Earth angel, earth angel, (wa-oh-oh-oh,)
will you be mine. (Ahhh.)
My darling dear, love you all the time.
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.
