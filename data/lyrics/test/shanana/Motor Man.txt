I'm a comin' on fast,
I'm a hangin' the curve,
Try to pass me, man,
If you've got the nerve.
---
I'll see you in my rearview,
As I'm a takin' the hill,
Is that all you got?
It's like you're standin' still.

I say zoom, zoom,
You'd better give me some room,
Zoom, zoom,
I'm about to lower the boom,
Zoom, zoom,
I'll be passing you soon,
Zoom, zoom,
Like a rocket to the moon.
---
I'll see you at the finish,
Don't you understand?
You don't stand a chance,
Against the motor man.

Open it up, daddy,
Give your best shot,
Look out now,
'cause you're about to be caught.
---
A full-open throttle,
Kickin' it in gear,
Adios baby,
You know I'm outta' here.

I say zoom, zoom,
You'd better give me some room,
Zoom, zoom,
I'm about to lower the boom,
Zoom, zoom,
Well I'll be passing you soon,
Zoom, zoom,
Like a rocket to the moon.
---
See you at the finish,
Don't you understand?
You don't stand a chance,
Against the motor man.

[Instrumental]
(Let it ride Rocky! Let it ride!)

I've got the engine,
Under the hood,
You'll never catch me, man,
I'm running good.
---
I've got the power,
Yeah, I've got the thrust,
Sorry there buddy,
But you'll be eatin' my dust.

I say zoom, zoom,
You'd better give me some room,
Zoom, zoom,
I'm about to lower the boom,
Zoom, zoom,
Well I'll be passing you soon,
Zoom, zoom,
Like a rocket to the moon.
---
I'll see you at the finish,
Don't you understand?
You don't stand a chance,
Against the motor man.

I say zoom, zoom,
You'd better give me some room,
Zoom, zoom,
I'm about to lower the boom,
Zoom, zoom,
I'll be passing you soon,
Zoom, zoom,
Like a rocket to the moon.
---
I'll see you at the finish,
Don't you understand?
You don't stand a chance,
Against the motor man.

I said, zoom, zoom,
Zoom, zoom,
Zoom, zoom, yeah,
Motor, motor, motor man.
---
I'm a motor, motor, motor man.
I'm a motor, motor, motor man.
Zoom, zoom,
Motor man.
Zoom, zoom, yeah,
Zoom, zoom, yeah,
I'm your motor man.
Zoom, zoom,
Zoom, zoom, baby,
I'm your motor man.
Zoom, zoom,
Zoom, zoom,
Motor man.
