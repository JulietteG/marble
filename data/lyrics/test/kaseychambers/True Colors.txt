You with the sad eyes, 
don't be discouraged though
I realize it's hard to take courage.
In a world full of people,
you can lose sight of it all,
and the darkness therew inside you makes you feel so small.

Chorus:
But I see your true colors shining through.
I see your true colors and that's why I love you.
So don't be afraid to let them show.
Your true colors,
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow.

Show me a smile then don't be unhappy
Can't remember when I last saw you Laughing.
If this world makes you crazy and you've taken all you can bear,
you call me up because you know i'll be there.

Chorus:
And I see your true colors shining through.
I see your true colors and that's why I love you.
So don't be afraid to let them show.
Your true colors,
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow.

Can't remember when I last saw you Laughing.
If this world makes you crazy and you've taken all you can bear,
you call me up because you know i'll be there.

Chorus:
And I see your true colors shining through.
I see your true colors and that's why I love you.
So don't be afraid to let them show.
Your True colors,
Your True colors,
Your True colors,
are shining through,
I see your true colors and that's why I love you.
So don't be afraid to let them show.
Your true colors,
True colors are beautiful like a rainbow.---Lyrics submitted by Keitra.
