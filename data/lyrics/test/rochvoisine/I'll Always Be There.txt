You and I
Have followed the trace
Laid by the people of faith and pride
With hungry eyes
You and I
Could conquer the stars
If we tried
Or simply live by simpler vows
And let the storm go by...

You and I
Have written the book
Line by line
And the few things that took to survive
Was your loving heart and mine
Should you go
Remember these words
As they show
Just how much I care
Don't you know
I'll always be there

I'll always be there
There when the world and its promise is failing
I'll always be there
There when the frost of its winter is cursing
I'll always be there
There when the tears in your eyes
Keep on asking

I'll always be there

You and I
Will follow the trace
Laid by people of faith and pride
With angry eyes gone blind
You and I
Will show them the light
We live by
So never again will they try
To keep us apart

I'll always be there
There when the world and its promise is failing
I'll always be there
There when the frost of its winter is cursing
I'll always be there
There when the tears in your eyes
Keep on asking me why

I'll always be there
There when the world and its promise is failing
I'll always be there
There when the tears in your eyes
Keep on asking me why

Asking me why

I'll always be there
There when the frost of its winter is cursing
I'll always be there
There when you're loving me such
You keep burning alive

I'll always be there
I'll always be there

I'll always be there
I'll always be there---Lyrics submitted by Gnothi.
