Time to listen to my confession.
I'm much less than I wanted to be, wanted to be.
You shine a light on my dark side, but you
Don't care what you see.

[Pre-chorus:]
Overjoyed over you overnight.
But that's what you do.

[Chorus:]
Why don't you lock me up? Enjoy it.
Lock me up with love.
Chain me to your heart's desire.
I don't want you to stop.
Lock me in and hold this moment.
Never get enough.
Either way, I'm never breaking free.
Lock me up.

(Oh, oh. [x3])
Lock me up.

Criticize.
You don't analyze me 'cause,
You can see what I'm trying to be, trying to be.
I've been lost and I've been blinded by,
All the things that I've seen.

[Pre-chorus 2:]
Overjoyed over you overnight.
Girl, that's what you do.

[Chorus 2:]
Why don't you lock me up? Enjoy it.
Lock me up with love.
Chain me to your heart's desire.
I don't want you to stop.
Lock me in and hold this moment.
Never get enough.
Either way, I'm never breaking free.
Lock me up.

Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh.
(Why don't ya? [x3] Lock me up.)
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh.
(Why don't ya? [x3] Lock me up.)

[Pre-chorus 2:]
Overjoyed over you overnight.
Girl, that's what you do.

[Chorus 2:]
Why don't you lock me up? Enjoy it.
Lock me up with love.
Chain me to your heart's desire.
I don't want you to stop.
Lock me in and hold this moment.
Never get enough.
Either way, I'm never breaking free.
Lock me up.---
