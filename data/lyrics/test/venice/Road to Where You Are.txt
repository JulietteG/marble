Homesick postcards and late night phone calls
Lonesome hotel blue
I've been too long on this highway
And I'm missing you

Sending out a message from my heart
We were never meant to be apart
Driving underneath my lucky star
I'm coming home
On the road to where you are

California warm winds blowin'
Clouds across the moon
Straight to you these wheels are rollin'
And I'll be home soon

(Chorus)

This road ends up right where it started
Holding onto you in your own backyard
I'm coming home
On the road to where you are---Lyrics submitted by menno.
