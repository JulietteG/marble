Although she's not alone, she feels so lonely
and when they do make love, she feels untouched.
When they kiss, she feels no lips upon hers,
though they have it all, they've lost so much.
Although they share a home, she says I miss you
and when she speaks, she doesn't make a sound
and though her days are filled, she feels so empty,
course even when he's there, he's not around.

And they are living there behind the garden wall,
in a house that's grown so small.
No-one sees the flowers fade and fall,
there behind the garden wall.

Although she took his name, he is a stranger.
When he looks at her, he doesn't see,
that even as she smiles, her heart is breaking,
because she knows the man he used to be.
Season after season nothing changes
and reason after reason comes and goes.
She wants to leave, but hangs on to the feeling,
that somewhere in the garden something grows.

So they keep living there behind the garden wall,
in a house that's grown so small.
No-one sees the flowers fade and fall,
there behind the garden wall.

Though they had it all, they've lost so much

And they're still living there behind the garden wall'
in a house that's grown so small.
No-one sees the flowers fade and fall,
there behind the garden wall, garden wall, garden wall.---Lyrics submitted by Annette Aerts.
