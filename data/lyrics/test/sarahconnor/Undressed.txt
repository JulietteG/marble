Each and every day
Each and every single day
People wanna tell me what to do
But I don't really care
I do never really care
'Cause I'm looking out for something new

[Bridge:]
And I know you know
All we're gonna do
Is we're making our dream come true
And I know you know
All we're gonna do
Is we're living our lives the way we want to

[Chorus:]
When do we get undressed
I don't wanna wait, baby, let's get started
When do we get undressed
Boy, I wanna know when the time is right to do it
When do we get undressed
I don't wanna wait, baby, let's get started
When do we get undressed
Boy, I wanna know when the time is right let's do it

[Verse 2:]
Pretty-like-a-pearl
Do you wanna see my world?
I do everything I wanna do
And when you're going there
Then you better be aware
I know I'm looking like your dream come true

[Bridge:]
And I know you know
All we're gonna do
Is keep on bouncing around forever
And I know you know
All we're gonna do
Is not wasting our time it's now or never

[Chorus]

Do it to me, give it to me

[Chorus 3X]---Lyrics submitted by tirzad.
