[Chorus:]
Come on let me take you on a magic ride
Boy I wanna show you better ways to fly
Whatever you wish for
I'll do it for you
All the other girls are a waste of time
Whatever they may have ain't as good as mine
Whatever you wish for
I'll do it for you

[Verse 1:]
I can light a fuse in you
Make you finally see all the things you need
If you wanna know the truth then you must believe
It's hidden here in me
When you finally cross the line
I know that you'll be mine
Boy you make our dreams come true
You know you only have to let go
That I can begin to show
What I've got for you
Come on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I can see it in your eyes
You've got the spark I need t o set my spirit free
And we don't even have to try time is on our side
And we can be complete
When you finally cross the line
I know that you'll be mine
Boy you make our dreams come true
You know you only have to let go
That I can begin to show
What I've got for you

[Chorus]

My boy TQ
