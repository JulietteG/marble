Let me tell you a story, sit back, relax and enjoy
I'm gonna make you feel good
This is soulicious

My daddy would lift me up and spin me around
Gladys, Tammi, Randy that was the sound
To which we danced until I fell asleep
And still now when I got a bad day
That's what I need
When my world is crazy
And nothing goes my way
I stay home
And let the soul of their music make my day
Lean back get into the groove
Feel delicious, don't be vicious
Get soulicious baby

Very soulicious baby that's what you are
When I hear the sound of Marvin's guitar
Aretha sing a tune and blow me away
The way you touch me I can never explain
Stevie knows just how to make me cry
And if it's magic then I now know why
Diana undefeated queen of my soul
Upside down and out of control

So soulicious, soulicious, so very soulicious
Do you feel it, can you feel it

So when you feel lost and lonely
Your work sucks and life's a mess
Just believe me
You should try my remedy
And put this music to the test
And if you never heard of soulicious before
Just trust me once you got hooked on the sound
You're gonna want more
Relax your mind sit back
And listen carefully
Step outta time forget your trouble
And sing with me yeah

Very soulicious baby that's what you are
When I hear the sound of Marvin's guitar
Aretha sing a tune and blow me away
The way you touch me I can never explain
Stevie knows just how to make me cry
And if it's magic then I now know why
Diana undefeated queen of my soul
Upside down and out of control---Lyrics submitted by saeed.
