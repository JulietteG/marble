[intro]
Just a little bit more love
Just a little bit more passion
This is how it should begin
Skin on skin

[verse 1]
If you leave me now
Telling me you failed somehow
Better think it all over
Just as long as loves around
Heres a true romance
Be aware and take your chance
Tomorrow Im gonna leave you
But I am here for you tonight

[bridge]
Every single day I want you to know
My love is true
So baby let me show you what to do

[chorus]
Just a little bit more love
Just a little bit more passion
This is how it should begin
Skin on skin

Just a little getting close
Just a little more affection
cause I dont think its a sin
Skin on skin

Dont you know that this game is to play
Just as long as its time
Cant you see that my hearts gotta know
When youre gonna be mine

Just a little more love
Just a little more love

[verse 2]
So we better get it on
What is here will soon be gone
When the leaves are falling
Then maybe we could fall apart

[bridge 2]
And there may come a time
When you will forget
My love is true
So baby let me show you what to do---Lyrics submitted by lyoko_94.
