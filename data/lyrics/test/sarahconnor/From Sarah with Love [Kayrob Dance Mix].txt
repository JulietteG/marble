For so many years we were friends
And yes I always knew what we could do
but so many tears in the rain felt the night you said
that love had come to you
I thought you were not my kind
I thought that I could never fear for you
the passion and love you were feeling
And so you left for someone new
and now that you are far and away
i am sending a letter today
from Sarah with love
shes got the lover she is dreaming of
she never found the words to say but I know that today
shes gonna send her letter to you
from Sarah with love
she took your picture to the stars above
and they told her it is true
she could dance for the love of you
so dont make her blue when she writes to you
from Sarah with love
So maybe the chance for romance is like a train to catch
before it is gone
I keep on waiting and dreaming youre strong enough to understand
As long as your so far away
im sending a letter each day
From Sarah with love
she got the lover she is dreaming of
she never found the words to say but i know that
today she is gonna send a letter to you
from Sarah with love
she took your picture to the stars above
and they told her it is true
she could dance for the love of you
so dont make her blue when she write to you
From sarah with love
lalallalallalalallalal
from sarah with love
she has got the lover she is dreaming of
she never found the words to say but i know that today she is gonna
send her letter to you
from sarah with love
shes got to know what you are thinking of
cos every little now and then and again and again
I know how her heart cries out for you
from sarah with love
she has got the lover she is dreaming of
from sarah for all sarah with love
she took your picture to stars above
and they told her it is true
she could dance for the love of you
so dont make her blue when she write to you
from Sarah with love
so dont make me blue when I write to you
from Sarah with love---Lyrics submitted by Kinan.
