[intro]
One and one is two
And the one for me is you
Only you

[Verse 1]
it's every time I see you I
know I have to have you
'Cause baby you just drive me wild
can't get you out of my mind
I feel just like I wanna lay
So close to you that people say
The two of us are merging
Oh baby this is urgent

[Chorus]
One and one is two and baby
the one for me is you
Now that you've learned the
ABC you're ready to come
inside my dreams
All I wanna do is show you a
love you never knew
So I will sing this song to
you and make you see one and
one is two

[Verse 2]
Now listen:
And when we are together, the
feeling's so much better
Just you and me we take a ride
To get into our inside
Dive deeper than the ocean's deep
Climb higher than the mountain's peak
So let us start the merging
'Cause baby this is urgent

[Chorus]

[b-chorus]
Love is on my mind, can I
get you in tonight
One and one is two, baby, baby
Up, down, all around let us
turn it inside out
One and one is two
