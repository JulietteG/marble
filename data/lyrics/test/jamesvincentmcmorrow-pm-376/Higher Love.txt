Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart and in the stars above,
Without it, life is wasted time.
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what's fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be.

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love,
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love, I've been thinking of?

Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear, standing out there alone
Oh a yearning, and it's real for me
There must be someone who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere

In this whole world, what's fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love,
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love, I've been thinking of?

I will wait for it, I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel the love come over me
Let me feel how strong it can be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above for this higher love. ---
