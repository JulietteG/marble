Finally gave up those old cigarettes
Sold that 67 red corvette
I miss the way an ice cold beer went down
We fire one up and pass it around

Well I don't roll with the boys no more
I quit everything you left me for
The one thing that I'll always be addicted to
Oh I'm down to my last bad habit - You

Miss you when I smell smoke
See you in a old car go by
Miss you when I hear that song
That we danced to
Girl, I'm down to my last bad habit - You

It's hard to make it through these lonely nights
If you come back to me, I'll be alright
I can't get past how much I'm wanting you
This is hell like I never knew

My heart won't let me let you go
I'm lost without you and I need you so
You're the one thing that I'll always be addicted to
Oh I'm down to my last bad habit
Yeah, I'm down to my last bad habit
Girl, I'm down to my last bad habit - You---
