I noticed you, noticed you walking through the door, yeah,
The sexiest, finnest thing dancing on the floor, yeah,
You move your body like I've never seen before, yeah,
You make me wish that I didnt have a girlfriend.

It's crazy so crazy the way your body's shaking,
I almosy feel guilty picturing you get naked,
But baby, baby, baby, you know how to work it,
You make me wish that I didnt have a girlfriend.

I love my girl, I love my girl but come on,
Your hotter than an oven turned on,
The thigs I wanna do with you are so wrong,
Wish I could stay but I should go home.

Dance with me,
Do you wanna dance with me girl, just for a little while,
Dance with me,
Dont you wanna dance with me girl. (Girl)

I noticed you, noticed you walking through the door, yeah,
The sexiest, finnest thing dancing on the floor, yeah,
You move your body like I've never seen before, yeah,
You make me wish that I didnt have a girlfriend.

It's crazy so crazy the way your body's shaking,
I almosy feel guilty picturing you get naked,
But baby, baby, baby, you know how to work it,
You make me wish that I didnt have a girlfriend.

My baby's good to me but your just to fine,
I've been obsessing bout you all night,
You're not a two or three, you're one plus nine,
Your not just burning up your on fire.

Dance with me,
Do you wanna dance with me girl, just for a little while,
Dance with me,
Dont you wanna dance with me girl. (Girl)

I noticed you, noticed you walking through the door, yeah,
The sexiest, finnest thing dancing on the floor, yeah,
You move your body like I've never seen before, yeah,
You make me wish that I didnt have a girlfriend.

It's crazy so crazy the way your body's shaking,
I almosy feel guilty picturing you get naked,
But baby, baby, baby, you know how to work it,
You make me wish that I didnt have a girlfriend.

Wish, wish,
You make me wish that I didnt have a girlfriend,
Wish, wish,
You make me wish even though I love my girlfriend.

Hey, hey
You make me, you make me, yeah
You make me, you make me.

I noticed you, noticed you walking through the door, yeah,
The sexiest, finnest thing dancing on the floor, yeah,
You move your body like I've never seen before, yeah,
You make me wish that I didnt have a girlfriend.

It's crazy so crazy the way your body's shaking,
I almosy feel guilty picturing you get naked,
But baby, baby, baby, you know how to work it,
You make me wish that I didnt have a girlfriend.---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
