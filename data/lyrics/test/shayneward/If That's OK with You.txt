[Verse 1]
I love the way that you look without your make-up
I had a girl before we met but we broke up
Theres something about you that makes me wanna to step up
Step up and be with you
If thats okay with you

We'll keep the neighbours to awake too late too late
Coz imma make you feel, that's how i see it happening 
Yeah we'll keep the neighbours awake too late too late
baby i wanna step up and be with you


[Chorus]
Im gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth 
Im gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
Im gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry
If thats okay with you


[Verse 2]
I wanna keep your tootbrush at my apartment
Make a second set of keys and ask you to move in
Im not crazy
I know what im getting myself in
I wanna live with you

[Chorus x2]
Im gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth 
Im gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
Im gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry
If thats okay with you
(If thats okay with you)

If thats okay with you
(If thats okay with you)
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
We'll keep the neighbours awake too late too late

We'll keep the neighbours to awake too late too late
