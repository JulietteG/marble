Wreckage - My mind
Insecure - All the time
ONCE LOVED - NOW PARALYZED
I ONCE THOUGHT - I'LL NEVER DIE

Frustrated - our simple lifes
No one listens - Everyone lies 
Who said "Home is where you hide"?

Strong as shit and now you see

I'm home - leave it to me
(leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home - leave it to me
(leave it to me)

From left to right...
[repeat]

I tried - my father said,
I'm scared - she always said
They grab and pull until I tear

MEANING - Too deep to swim
When's a good time for the end?
Who said I was YOUR FRIEND?

I'm home - leave it to me
(leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home - leave it to me
(leave it to me)

From left to right...
[repeat]
Suffocated - our simple life
No one listens - everyone dies
Never a chance - how could you see?

I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me now that you've seen)
I'm home - leave it to me (leave it to me)
I'm home - leave it to me (what the fuck did you say?)

From left to right...
