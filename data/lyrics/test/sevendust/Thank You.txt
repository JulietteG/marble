So help me to see
Give me a chance to come around
All this closure we need
Will this evade us all somehow

On my own
Forgive me now we know
Where to go from here
You are the beginning and the end
To all of this

Just wait
Feel it coming now
(find a reason
To live)
Fall back
What
No condition
Come on
The time has now-
(believe in me)

So thanks for coming around
And pushing my head back to the ground
Thank you for slowing me down
I need to fall back and start it all over

Been holding on so long
Denying what I've done
I destroyed myself but I wish you well
Completely overthrown

On my own
Release me now we know
All the answers here we are
The beginning and the end to all of this---
