Beneath the skies above, nature always shall remain.
Nature won't judge, love and hatred are the same.
Not the heathen nor the white man have answers to explain:
Should you live for yourself or die in his name.

They lift their heels behind,
Their face not like mine,
I hear whispers each time I close my eyes.

Another man dies for the god he believes
He'll deliver his soul from what he can't achieve.
Not the old man nor the generals know right from wrong.
They'll watch while the blood from their children grow long.

When the hellfire came down,
I never heard a sadder sound--
I heard whispers every time I closed my eyes.

Driven by passion, no heaven will allow,
'Cause nothing will stop them from coming for me now.
Not reason nor religion can ease my pain,
And I know I'll be saved if my memories fall away.

Blame the suffering and desire.
Got kindling on the fire.
I hear whispers as they burn upon the fire. ---
