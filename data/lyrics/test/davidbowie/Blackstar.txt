In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes

On the day of execution, on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(Im a blackstar, Im a blackstar)

How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd
(Im a blackstar, Im a blackstar, Im not a gangstar)

I cant answer why (Im a blackstar)
Just go with me (Im not a filmstar)
Im-a take you home (Im a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes (Im not a popstar)
And your sedatives, boo (Im a blackstar)
Youre a flash in the pan (Im not a marvel star)
Im the great I am (Im a blackstar)

Im a blackstar, way up, on money, Ive got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
(Im a blackstar, Im a blackstar)

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(Im a blackstar, Im a star's star, Im a blackstar)

I cant answer why (Im not a gangstar)
But I can tell you how (Im not a flam star)
We were born upside-down (Im a star's star)
Born the wrong way round (Im not a white star)
(Im a blackstar, Im not a gangstar
Im a blackstar, Im a blackstar
Im not a pornstar, Im not a wandering star
Im a blackstar, Im a blackstar)

In the villa of Ormen stands a solitary candle
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes
On the day of execution, only women kneel and smile
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah---
