Well Billy rapped all night
about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head
when he was twenty-five
Speed jive don't want to stay alive
When you're twenty-five
And Wendy's stealing clothes
from Marks and Sparks
(unlocked cars)
And Freedy's got spots (zits)
from ripping off the stars from his face
Funky little boat race
Television man is crazy
saying we're juvenile deliquent wrecks
Oh man I need TV
when I got T Rex
Oh brother you guessed
I'm a dude dad

All the young dudes
(Hey dudes)
Carry the news
(Where are ya)
Boogaloo dudes
(Stand up Come on)
Carry the news
All the young dudes
(I want to hear you)
Carry the news
(I want to see you)
Boogaloo dudes
(And I want to talk to you all of you)

Now Lucy looks sweet
'cause he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule
it's a real
mean team
But we can love
oh yes we can love
And my brother's back at home
with his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off
on that revolution stuff
What a drag
too many snags
Now I've drunk a lot of wine
and I'm feeling fine
Got to race
some cat to bed
Oh is there concrete all around
Or is it in my head
Yeah I'm a dude dad

All the young dudes
(Hey dudes)
