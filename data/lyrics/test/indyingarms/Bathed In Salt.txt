I'm not starving for you
Just craving what I need
I've taken one too many
And now it's time to feed
I'll rip your insides out
I grabbed you by the throat and brought you to your knees
You look so good to eat

 I'm gonna eat your face
I'll eat your fucking face
And leave the fucking trace
What the fuck is going on?
I've torn this corpse to shreds
My hunger is forever growing
I don't give a fuck
I'm the walking dead
I am the walking dead

What the fuck is wrong with this world?
Living among disease
Zombies are becoming more real than our conscience plays them out to be

Come feed on my flesh
You cannot live without me
Come feed on my flesh
And tell me how the fuck it feels

Come feed on my flesh
You cannot live without me
Eat me alive

I am gnawing on your skin
I've been chewing on your flesh
And then my meal is complete
Now who the fuck is next?---Lyrics submitted by Ryan Trudeau.
