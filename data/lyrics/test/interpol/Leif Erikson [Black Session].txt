she says it helps with the lights out
a rapid glow is like braille to the night
she swears i'm a slave to the details 
but if your life is such a big joke 
why should i care?

the clock is set for nine but you
know you're gonna make it eight

so that you two can take some time,
teach each other to reciprocate

she feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids gloves
but she doesn't know that i left my urge in the icebox

she swears i'm just prey for the female
well then hook me up and throw me, baby cakes, cause i like to get hooked 


the clock is set for nine but you
know you're gonna make it eight

all the people that you've loved
they're all bound to leave some keepsakes 

i've been swinging all the time, think its time i learned your way 
i picture you and me together in the jungle it will be ok


i'll bring you when my life sails through the night
that is supposing you don't sleep tonight

its like learning a new language
helps me catch on my mind

if you don't bring up those lonely parts
this could be a good time

its like learning a new language

you come here to me 

well collect those lonely parts and set them down

you come here to me
