Yours is the only verson of my desertion
That i could ever subscribe to
That is all that i can do
Tou are a past dinner, the last winner
I'm raping all around me 
Until the last drop is behind you

But you're so cute when you're frustrated, dear
Yeah you're so cute when you're sedated, dear
Oh yes, dear

(chorus)
Sleep tight 
Grim right
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight 
Grim right
We have two hundred couches where you can 
Sleep tight 
Grim right
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tonight
Sleep tonight 
Sleep tonight
Sleep tonight
You are the only person whos completely certain
There's nothing here to be into
That is all that you can do
You are a past sinner, the last winner
And everything we've come to
It makes you, you, you
But you can not safely say
While i will be away
That you will consider sadly
How you helped me to stray
You will not reach me 
I am presenting a position
Of past resentment
That i can't consider
And now there is this distance so

(chorus)

Something to say
Something to do
Nothing to say
When there's nothing to do
Oh
Oh---Lyrics submitted by Yessenia.
