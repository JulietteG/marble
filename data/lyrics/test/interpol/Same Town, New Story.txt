Same town new story
They bridged a faded spin?
He was bound for glory
She found her wedding man
So there she stood by him, through it all
And there she stood by him
She was pounding on the wall
She said "it feels like the whole world is up on my shoulders"
Feels like the whole world coming down on me

And how many bones were lost, cause he just had to play his hand?
A rot? Is a womans duty, she was always tougher than
She said " whos gonna save them from you "
" Whos gonna save them from you "

I have to chase another snake until hes gone

So there she stood by him, to the law
And there she stood by him, and he was down on his knees

She said we are still alive
We are still alive

Feels like the whole world is up on my shoulders
Feels like the whole world is up on my shoulders
Feels like the whole world is coming down on me

Pinch her so slowly
Pinch her so slowly
Pinch her so slowly
Pinch her so slowly---
