Feel my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Summon us for peace
Do what we can

Feel my desire
Favor the bold
Some of us flew to the air
The others roam

It seeks my desire
Come on baby
Play me out
Play me out

It looked like the chance, to me
Play me out
Play me out
It's trying to change the part

See my desire
No solemn moods
All of us are teamates
We stick to the rules

This is real life desire
Come on baby
Play me out
Play me out

That looked like your chance, to me
to play me out
Oh, thought I gave you up
It's time to change apart

I feel the
I feel you
Erase

Feel my desire
Frustrated man
Some of us to to the air
The others sprang

Feel my desire
Come on baby
Play me out
Play me out

Ot's time to change apart
Play me out
Oh, thought I gave you up
And don't count your stars on me

I feel the
I feel you
Erase---
