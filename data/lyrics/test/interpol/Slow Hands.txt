Yeah, but nobody searches and nobody cares somehow
When the loving that youve wasted comes raining from a hapless cloud
Then I might stop and look upon your face
Disappear in your sweet, sweet gaze
See the living that surrounds me dissipate in a violent place

Cant you see what youve done to my heart, and soul?
This is a wasteland now

W spies, we slow hands
Put the weights all around yourself
We spies, oh yeah, we slow hands
You put the weights all around yourself

Now I submit my incentive romance, I watch the pole dance
Of the stars, we rejoice because the hurting is so painless
From the distance of passing cars
But I am married to your charms and grace
I just go crazy like the good old days 
You make me want to pick up a guitar and celebrate the myriad ways that I love you

Cant you see what youve done to my heart, and soul?
This is a wasteland now

We spies, yeah, we slow hands
You put the weights around yourself
We spies, oh yeah, we slow hands
Killer for hire, you know not yourself

We spies, we slow hands
You put the weights all around yourself
We spies, oh yeah, we slow hands
We retire like nobody else

We spies, intimate slow hands
Killer for hire, you know not yourself
We spies, intimate slow hands
You let the face slap around herself---Lyrics submitted by Manny.
