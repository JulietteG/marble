There were days of on the wing
When nobody cared but you
All I wish I could feel is salvation
The proof of the voice always knew
If it's time should signify my new skin
Can't be proud of
These are all my creations
Leaving me

Twice as hard, twice as hard
I give it right back to you
I give it right back to you twice as hard

I rely on you and I to let you in, become my lover
Sewing up my creations
One things that all be

Twice as hard, twice as hard
I give it right back to you
I give it right back to you twice as hard---
