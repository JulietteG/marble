Freak out
It already made us see
For now and we
Break now
Just say that in a way it go by
It's my own time (cruising in my blue supreme)
It's my own time

When love comes, honey, take it
Only one in a hundred make it
We fake until there's nothing to fake

Is someone there, I'm dying to be
Cruising in my blue supreme

Fake
It already captured me
Alone
Fake out
Just say that in a way it go by
It's my own time
My own time

Is someone there, I'm dying to be
Cruising in my blue supreme
Is someone there, I'm dying to be (cruising in my blue)
Is someone there I'm dying to be (cruising in my blue)
Cruising in my blue supreme

Just say that in a way it go by
My own time (cruising in my blue supreme)

When love comes, honey, show it
So many of us growling
This kind of shit don't heal in a week

Cruising in my blue supreme
Cruising in my blue supreme
Is someone there, I'm dying to be (cruising in my blue)
But nothing ever comes for free (cruising in my blue)
Cruising in my blue supreme
Something that I'm trying to create
Just a mirror with shoes and to shake (cruising in my blue)
Cruising in my blue supreme---
