I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me

Shine up my old brown shoes
Put on a brand new shirt
Get home early from work
If you say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Feeling all alone without a friend
You know you feel like dying
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me

Shine up my old brown shoes
Put on a brand new shirt
Get home early from work
If you say that you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?
Feeling all alone without a friend
You know you feel like dying
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying?

I want you to want me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me---
