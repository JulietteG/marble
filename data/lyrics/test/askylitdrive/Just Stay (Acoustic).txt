I won't see you for miles
Hoping every day you find the strength to stay with me
I'm crippled by the sound you make when I walk out
Not too much longer now
Just stay
Another life I'd always be there
Another night of barely breathing
But when the lights go out I'll be listening
Just stay

I cannot turn around or take back everything I missed while I was away
Just stay

I need for you to believe
If it were up to me we'd live out every day the same
But I won't see you for days
Another life I'd always be there
Another night of barely breathing
But when the lights go out I'll be listening
Just stay
Another life I'd never understand
Another night I'll give you all I can
I know I need you now more than I ever did
Just stay

Just stay, stay with me
Just stay a little longer
Another life I'd always be there
Another night of barely breathing
But when the lights go out I'll be listening
Just stay
Another life I'd never understand
Another night I'll give you all I can
I know I need you now more than I ever did

Just stay
Just stay
Just stay with me---
