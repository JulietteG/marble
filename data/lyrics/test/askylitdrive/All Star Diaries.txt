Why you so scared?

I am a non worthy sinner
Still I pray for you
When will you be the star in the sky for me
All eyes on you

Sing a song for me
Sing it till you see my face
Lay your trust in me
I'll be your remedy note

Scrambling to shut the door
Leave the cold wanting more
Scrambling to shut the door
Leave the cold wanting more

Embrace your mind
Set it free
Remember everything you lost

Have a seat in my car
We'll take the 99 north past 3am
Still breathing now
I'm not leaving why are you so scared?
Recline the seat back, let's drive
North till the sunrise

Why you so...
I'm not leaving from this parade till I die
Why you so scared?
Why you so scared?

With your hands on me
I'll keep my eyes on you
I'll promise to be
A little secret that will pull you through
Secret passage through the weight of the world

Why you so,
I'm not leaving from this parade till I die
Why you so scared?
Why you so scared?

Hands at my side
Oh will I live or die?
Will I live or die?
I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
This is my life
Through open eyes
This is my life (This is my life)
Through open eyes
