The battle loves to choose its fights
Collapse the sight of soldiers eyes
Bombs cascading over me
May my body rest in pieces

Spring morning rain
Heal the wounds in me
On me
The battle is won
Im not coming home

Spring morning rain
Stitch me up with strings of symphonies
On me

The battle is won
Close your eyes just dream
Im not coming home
The battle is won
Close your eyes just...

Dream of me, locked inside your mind Ill hide
Scream my name, feel me breathe along your thighs
Close your eyes just dream

Grasping of your sheets
Turn out the lights
Holding on to memories
Never felt so right

Shaking, squirming in your skin tonight
Oh my Marie, oh my Marie

This is a reason for broken wings

Spring morning rain
Heal the wounds in me
On me
(The battle loves to choose its fights
Collapse the sight of soldiers eyes
Bombs cascading over me
May my body rest in pieces)

The battle is won
Close your eyes just dream
Im not coming home
The battle is won
Close your eyes just...

Dream of me, locked inside your mind Ill hide
Scream my name, feel me breathe along your thighs
Close your eyes just dream
Close your eyes just dream
Close your eyes just dream
Close your eyes just dream
Close your eyes just dream---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
