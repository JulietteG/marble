The time has come to show yourself
Nothing can stop us now
This is a wasteland
Make your move

Everybody everybody get down get down
This isn't a lie
Just take a word from the wise

This is a wasteland
Make your move

They are coming for you
It's tearing us all into pieces

I'll find you in the deepest of nights
You'll be the one who sets me free
To all of our wasted nights
To all of our wrongs we made right

Everybody everybody get down get down
This isn't a lie
Just take a word from the wise

This is a wasteland
Make your move---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
