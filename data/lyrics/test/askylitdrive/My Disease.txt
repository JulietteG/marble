Awaken to the eyes of glazed humor
The haze in my somber eyes... it burns... so cold
The things you wish you could know

As he enters into the world as a ghost
The terror inflicted scrapes your bones
Let him hold you close

"look" where "over there" oh I see what you mean
Fear me
Step too close to see what I see
Construct desire
The fine line between disease and what I need

As he enters into the world as a ghost
The terror inflicted scrapes your bones
Let him hold you close

It's exactly what it seems
The horror I live
The evil that beats inside me
It's called "my disease"---Lyrics submitted by erika.
