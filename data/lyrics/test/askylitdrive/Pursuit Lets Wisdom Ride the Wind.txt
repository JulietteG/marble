Where's your heart?
Leave the sun behind
Into the night
Follow me we ride
To faultier is not an option tonight
Laying down our last sacrifice
Let's bring our swords to life

And I'm waiting for tomorrow
Will we both go home?
And I'm waiting for tomorrow
Where we have no home
I know

My life is worth it you're beautiful
Just save yourself yeah!
Leave the hurt and despair all behind
I must pave my way

Where's your heart?
Leave the sun behind
Into the night
Where are you my bride?
The choices I've made negate the light from my life
As I bring forth my end tonight
My heart beats so divine

And I'm waiting for tomorrow
Will we both go home?
And I'm waiting for tomorrow
Where we have no home
I know

And all the faces that said they loved me
I gave my all for your life---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
