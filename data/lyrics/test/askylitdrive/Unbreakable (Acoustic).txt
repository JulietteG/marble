You play the fool
But you're insecure
You twist my words
And fake the lies
I've heard a 1000 times
I'll breath in the ashes,
But you'll never break me.

So long,
I am sick at the thought of you
Look back
At all that you put me through
Now gone!
My never forever it's all
On you!

Can't you see
What you don't wanna believe
Can't you see
If loving you was so right,
Why did it feel so wrong?

Can't you see
That you are killing me?
Let me be,
I only wanna be free
I'll make a noise so loud
That across the world you'll hear it.

You break the rules
And I'll set the score
You twist my nerves
And take the life I earned,
By telling lies
I'll breath in the ashes
But you'll never make me.

Can't you see
What you don't wanna believe
Can't you see
If loving you was so right,
Why did it feel so wrong?

Can't you see
That you are killing me?
Let me be,
I only wanna be free
I'll make a noise so loud
That across the world you'll hear it.

Can't you see
That you are killing me?
Let me be,
I only wanna be free
This is who I am, now
I'll scream until you hear it

I'm sick at the thought of you
Look back at all that you put me though
Can't you see, can't you see?
If everything was right, why did it feel so wrong?

If loving you was so right, why did it feel so wrong?

Can't you see
That you are killing me?
Let me be,
I only wanna be free
I'll make a noise so loud
That across the world you'll hear it.

Can't you see
That you are killing me?
Let me be,
I only wanna be free
This is who I am, now
I'll scream until you hear it---
