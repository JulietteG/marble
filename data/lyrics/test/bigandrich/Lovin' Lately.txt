Out with my friends and here it goes again 
Somebody asks me where youre at 
I dont know what to say, I try to everyday 
Its been so long since you called 
I bet youre having a real good time 
But I hate to think of what youre doing tonight 
And who youre holding close 
I really dont want to know 

Who you been lovin lately 
Who you been calling baby 
Who you been running around, in this tell-all town 
I guess you finally got the best of me 
I guess you thought Id never see 
You know its so hard to believe how we came down 

Like we were nothing baby 
Who you been lovin lately 

I thought that I could trust the way we made love 
You made me feel there was something real 
Now everything youve said is lying in our bed 
like shattered glass against my back 
The way you got me just blows my mind 
Didnt care enough to even say goodbye 
Id give anything now if I could stop thinking about 

Yeah, who been lovin lately 
I dont want to know, I got to know 
I dont want to know but I got to know 
I dont want to know, I got to know 
I dont want to know but I got to know---
