[Indo G]
Look Im a playa for real, my deck like royal flush,
Fruit loop blunts, they full of purple and that orange kush,
Stay on a mission,
The rims glisten,
Im a rider,
You feel like a midget,
With 30 inches,
Right beside ya,
Paint drippin Candy coated, Im goin to diplomatic,
Automatic,
... Photogenic,
Im full of purple karats,
Daily habit,
... DUI,
And I find,
The friendly skies,
Crash landed,
... Auto pilot,
I smoke a whole pound,
Catch me off in Honolulu, sippin on a Slurricane,
Belly dancin, red skirts, niggas scrotums with no shame,
?? nigga, I gets that butta,
I keeps it gutta,
I am that nigga, there is no other,

[What a feeling mane,
We stackin paper to the ceiling mane,
???? Rims choppin like a ceiling fan,
What a wonderful feeling, I got my ass in,
What a wonderful feeling, I got my ass in] x2

[Miscellaneous]
? to the ceiling bitch, I got my south Memphis drawers on,
North Memphis cap, ???? Jersey with the paws on,
Orange Mound socks, with the all Black Haven shorts, and the Westwood belt match,
Bottom line, the Ms on my back,
Miscellaneous muhfucka, take note how I built this shit,
You aint gotta like it or love it but you goin feel this shit,
Read between the lines nigga, Im talking yay,
And break the legs off yo money cause its walkin away,
Ey,

Quit wastin time lil mama, goin getcho ass in,
She mad at me why, same shit I told her last friend,

To you, it may be something,
But me, its never nothing,

While you broke muhfuckas tryina ball on budgets,
