In that room,
Where you sit,
Where you live,
I know it's good to you.
God, I know it's good to you.
In your fear,
where you lay,
Where you think it eases all the pain,
All the pain of what you made.

One last night at the lonely wheel
One last taste of the sin we feel
One hope in the fear that drives us on,
One last drink just to kill the pain,
One last breath before I say your name,
I'm giving into you.
I'm giving into you.

If you could see in me
(see in me)
There is all you want
(all you want)
There is all you want
(all you want)
If you would just give in,
It will get easier,
It will get easier,
(If you could just give in it would get...)

One last night at the lonely wheel
One last taste of the sin we feel
One hope in the fear that drives us on,
One last drink just to kill the pain,
One last breath before I say your name,
I'm giving into you.
I'm giving into you.

I get it,
I need to fall.
I get it,
I need to call.
Me and who I am are so in the way.
Me and who I am, we are so in the way.

One last night at the lonely wheel
One last taste of the sin we feel
One hope in the fear that drives us on,
One last drink just to kill the pain,
One last breath before I say your name,
I'm giving into you.
I'm giving into you.

(One last night at the lonely wheel,)
(One last breath before I say your name,)
(I'm giving into you.)
(I'm giving into you.)---Lyrics submitted by Annabelle.
