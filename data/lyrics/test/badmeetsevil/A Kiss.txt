[Intro]
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed (x4)

[Verse 1: Royce]
Nickle Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper to shot a fan
Guccis my absolute state of mind, like Wakas man
Chopper sprayin, getting head in a car called, new Gallardo
This bitch sucking my dick today, call her yesterdays news tomorrow
Stretch a nigga out, Im the new Tae-bo bout to cross over, Im the new Ivo
bout to saves a couple of these bitches, thats right, Im the new Bible
You? You five-O, me? Im all grounded than punishments
But Im too fly though, yall niggas be whinin, I should call you Moscato

[Eminem]
Look down at the floorboard
It looks like someone left a pair of stiletto shoes in my Tahoe
Never know just what type of a hoe inside of my ride I may let
Last night went to 5 a.m., and she aint even recover from last Friday yet
Hoes all over the ride like its an ice cream truck, I can see why they fret
I already ran over two hoes and I aint get out the fucking driveway yet
Soon as I open the door, you try to resist, what for? Get in girl, dont front
Shorty your, fightin an unwinnable war, its useless as tits on a boar, little tits on a whore
Got em actin like spoiled brats kickin  and screamin like little kids throwing fits on the floor
Get in the whip but you aint turning this frog into a prince, why you trying to keep convincing me for?

[Hook]
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed (you wont get one)
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed (not from me)
I wanna get kissed, kissed, kissed
(not on the lips are you crazy maybe the cheek but thats all you gon get from me)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now you in my whip just long as you understand that I cant be whipped
You say companionship, I say abandon ship, Im a gigolo so you know
Im always on the go, I aint got no time to slow down for no relationshit
Drop the P and add a T, yeah, you can get mad at me all you want
But Im ghost before you can even say boo, hun let alone call me one
A one night stand is all he wants wit a female fan, yeah, one like Stan
And hes so about a one nightstand this bedroom only has two lamps and only one nightstand
Get the hint? Ooh yeah boo, eew! I aint finnna argue but why do you think
They call it boo? Yeah, cause the sound of its posed to scare you

[Royce]
Oh ho, we can share you in the back of the McLaren
I dont give a fuck what your name is, we gon call you Hi and Bye
Hope you bi in the mean time your name is Sharon
Slows the flow down so I can what? Tell you same face
I make when Im shooting the guns the same face that I make when I fuck
From the back of my hand on your neck pressing your face against the sheets its insane
You vin change, cause Im outta this world girl I got that Milky Way dick vein
Im at an all-time high with highness, Im at an all-time fly with flyness
And this is exactly what they say when they bow to your highness, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Royce]
Nickle Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper that shot a fan
(Push a chick out the car while its moving like Wakas man)
Her bottoms dark, but her top is tan, her private parts
Got her on the pole like the opposite of her papas plan
(Come on stripper, lets hit the strip 180 throw it in reverse
And drop the trans Im in the trance, now look at this bitch dance)
Looking at this tramp, like what you wearing girl, quit playing
(Yeah bitch and them scrach and sniff pants? Well let me scratch em)
Let me sniff, yeah What? Did I say that?
Im on lean like styrofoam cups and kickstands

[Eminem]
Middle finger stuck on fuck, stiff hands
But girl you got a butt like no if ands
So yea what the hell, maybe, oh hell, Shady, hell tell it like it is
So tell Katie Perry hes on the tail, hes tailgating
These bells are my maiden call and Im here, bells waiting and tell Lady
Gaga, she can quit her job at the post office, shes still a mail lady
Wouldnt fuck her with her dick you heard, you heard the verdicts in
Hes allergic to divas, and take meat cleavers to em
Him dont give a damn about beaver do him?
What a demon, a behemoth, evil just seems to be seething through him

[Royce]
I like the little strip tease you doing this evening, you and me gon find
Three more chickadees and have a menage like Nicki
You hot like a Dickie outfit in Texas without shit under it, sweating
Suck my dick, both gets to steppins my logic

[Eminem]
My God trick, my dick is hard, thick as a yardstick
What we gonna do? Ride around til were carsick
Then Im gonna put this shit in park like dog shit
And you can blow me in the dark in the parking lot
Of the trailer park by the garbage
What you waiting on? Me to roll out the carpet?
Condoms are in the glove compartment, lets start it
Think Im joking? What, am I sitting here
Tryna make fake farts with my armpits?
Tryna get you to spit pop through your nose?
Am I here to amuse you? Stop it

[Royce]
Im in your pocket outside of a church
The other hand reaching for bottom of your purse
You giving me head in a boxing stance
My dicks so big you could drop it in dirt
Im not your man, were sparring partners
Theres five things you are in charge of, thats
Sucking a dick, sucking a dick, sucking a dick
Sucking a dick, sucking a dick

[Eminem]
If you aint sucking a dick, why you sitting there
With puckered lips? Oh thats collagen, mothafucking bitch
What you mean howd you, get suckered into this
You gon jump into my truck and then try to get truculent?
(You should be suffering, you should be cooking
You should be buckling your seatbelt with oven mitts)
Excuse me while Im making an ass of myself
But its only cause I just wanna get
