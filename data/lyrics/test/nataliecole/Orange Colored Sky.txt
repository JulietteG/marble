I was walking along
mindin' my business
when out of the orange colored sky

wonderful you came by

I was hummin' a tune
drinkin' in sunshine
when out of that orange colored view

Wham

I got'a look at you
one look an i yelled "timber"
watch out for flying glass

Cause the celing fell in
and the bottom fell out
I went in to a spin
and i started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it"

I was walking along
mindin' my business
when love came and hit me in the eye

out of the orange colored sky

well, one look and i yelled "timber"
watch out for flying glass

Cause the celing fell in
and the bottom fell out
I went in to a spin
and i started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it"

I was walkin' along
mindin' my business
when love came and hit me in the eye
