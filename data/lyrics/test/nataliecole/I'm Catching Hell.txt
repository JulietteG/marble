Tonight, I, I just want to talk to the ladies
Oh fellows your cool but girls
If you've got a good man
You'd better keep him

Oh I know you're saying right now
What does she know?
Who is she to tell me about my situation
Well, I don't know your situation
But whatever it is, you should try to stay together

You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember
Well, today it's not nothing, just don't let him leave you, honey
'Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those
Real big things you loved about him
It was the real small things, go on and laugh but it's true

You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house
But never paid any attention to
Like helping with the groceries
And helping in the yard, painting and repairing and
Huh, paying the bills

But you know now
All I have is memories and regrets
I could have given our love a chance to grow but no
I had to challenge it and be heard
Let me tell you something

That female liberation stuff
I don't know, sometimes
I don't think it's worth it
And I'm really feeling
Feeling kind of bad y'all

I'm catching hell living here alone
I never realized, oh Lord, that you mean so much to me
I'm catching Hell living here alone, I want you to come back, baby
Come back 'cause here's where you belong, oh yeah

If I could replay
If I could replay that whole scene again, oh well
You know that I would never, never say it again
That our love, our love is at it's end

And oh, you know that I would kind of ease on back, yes I would
And let confusion pass on by
I took a fool's way out, oh yeah
Without one good reason why

I'm catching hell, catching hell
Lord I'm living, living, living here alone
Alone, lone, I didn't believe it could be
You know all the pressure on me, all the time

Oh, I'm catching hell, well, well
Living here alone, lone, lone, lone
Lone, lone, lone, to tell you the truth, to tell you the truth
I'm going out of my mind, yeah

(Oh, do you hear me tonight)
I don't have too much more to say except
(This is my story)
Somebody told me that if you've got something
(Hey, this is my song)

That's good to you and you don't use it, you might lose it
(Sad, sad, sad, song)
(Song, so sad)

So girls hold on to your good thing
(Oh)
(You gotta hold on a little bit now)

And don't let go, oh do you hear me tonight
It's so sad living alone, living alone
Hold on to your good thing, hold on
(Well, well)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, Lordy, Lordy do you know what it's like

Catching hell
(Somebody turn up the microphone, oh)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no---Lyrics submitted by jamesha.
