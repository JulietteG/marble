I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind

And there's nothin' particularly wrong
It's a feelin' I feel inside
When I woke up early this mornin'
It was starin' me straight in my eyes

I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind

When you touch me I can't resist
And you've touched me a thousand times
When I think of your tender kiss, ah
Then and there I start to unwind, ooh, in your arms

I like to be, yeah, caressin' you gentle
And tenderly, oh, yeah, from sunrise to sunset
All through the day, I've been waitin' for your return
And you know this is where I'll be

I can say to the world I've learned
Only you can satisfy me
Satisfy me, oh
You have made me so very happy

Oh baby, baby, love, love, on my, my, my, my mind
Love, love, on my mind, I've got love on my mind, yeah
It's a whole lot of love, it's a whole lot of love, yes, it is
I can't hear ya, say it for me one more time

Oh, I like the way you say, when you say it for me, yeah
Love, love, ooh, you know, it's like paradise, say it twice
Love, love, got a whole lot of love, whole lot of love for you, baby, yeah
Love, you know this thing, I got love, yeah

I've got love on my mind, oh, love on my mind
Love on my mind, love on my mind
Love on my mind, love on my mind
Love on---
