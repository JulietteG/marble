I found my love at Avalon
Beside the bay
I left my love at Avalon
And sailed away
I dream of him at Avalon
From dusk until dawn
And so I think I'll travel on
To Av-va-lon

Yes I found my love at Avalon
Beside the bay
I left my love at Avalon
And sailed away
Oh I, dream of him at Avalon
From dusk until dawn
And so I think I'll travel on
To Av...va-lon...---
