Gimme some time, baby
I know you're thinkin' that I'm playin'
But I'm saying that I wouldn't hurt you for the world, oh no

I'm not so blind, baby
I need your lovin' and you know it
Yes, I do, well
'Cause I'll show it, I don't wanna be hurt girl

If you want me to I'll keep it a secret
But please let me get through your door
'Cause I guarantee that once we get started
You'll soon be begging for more

You want the whole world to know that we are one
So why don't you gimme some time, baby
Let's take advantage not for granted for the good things
We've got the good things

I don't want to be hurt you
You just be kind, baby
We've got a good thing and I know it, let's not blow it, oh
'Cause I wouldn't hurt you for the world, I'm serious

I believe you think that I haven't noticed
The look in your eyes when you smile
And my senses tell me there's somethin' missin'
So please let me stay for a little while

I want the whole world to know that we are one
We've got it together, one, baby, we're one
So why don't you gimme some time, baby
I know what you're thinkin' that I'm playin'
But all I'm sayin'

'Cause I wouldn't hurt you for the world, I'm serious
Gimme some time, baby, gimme some time, baby
Gimme some time, baby, gimme some time, baby
Gimme some time, baby, gimme some time, baby

Gimme some time, baby, gimme some time, baby
Gimme some time, baby, gimme some time, baby
Gimme some time, baby, gimme some time, baby---
