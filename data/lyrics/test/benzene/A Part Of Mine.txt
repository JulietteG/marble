A part of mine is going away

 I don't know why they can't stay any longer

 Brand new things are flowing to an empty part of mine

 And my fulfilled part of mine will leave the same way

 12 pack eggs sing merrily

 Talking about their new eggshell

 (I'm ) always feeling to lose an important part of mine 

 The only way to keep my thought is to kill my thought that's getting old

 Many people said "you are a little dumb"

 But Why don't they want any thought of yours

 Many people see those things are not for need

 But where is your chief thing in your life?

 I just don't want to be hung on every change

 ...To my part

 A part of mine , New part of mine that

 Kills me everyday

 New part of mine make me puzzled everyday

 It is erasing my valuation

 To escape, To escape from the road will cure my mind

 My mind will run to the past part of mine

 Whenever get back those past part of mine

** I don't need any more things 

    Don't disturb ,I'll go my own way---Lyrics submitted by singuya.
