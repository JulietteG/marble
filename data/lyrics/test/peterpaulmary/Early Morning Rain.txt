In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine big seven-o-seven set to go
But I'm out here on the grass where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes my friend she is rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar see the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This ol' ariport's got me down it's no earthly good to me
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground cold and drunk as I might be
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain---Lyrics submitted by Lori Colby.
