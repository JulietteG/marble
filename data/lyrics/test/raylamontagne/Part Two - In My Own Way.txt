Lock the door, Draw the shades
Close my eyes, I'm miles away...

I'll spend the day, In my own way...

Count the hours, Mark the days
Underneath it all, The rising swirling
Of the waves...

I'll spend the day, In my own way...

All the plans, That were made
Let them die! Let them fade...

I'll spend the day, In my own way...

Please understand...I'm only human!

After all, Said and done...
Only here a moment and
The moment's gone...

I'll spend the day, In my own way...

Please understand...I'm only human!
At times I fail, At times at fault...

Don't break your back
Tryin to carry, Weight of the world
Can't please them all!

Ahhhhhhhhh, Ewwwwww
Ahhhhhhhhh, Ewwwwww

Lock the door, Draw the shades
Close my eyes, I'm miles away...

I'll spend the day, In my own way...
I'll spend the day, In my own way...
I'll spend the day, In my own way....---
