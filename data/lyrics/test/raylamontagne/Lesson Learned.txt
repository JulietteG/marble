Well the truth it fell so heavy,
Like a hammer through the room.
That I could choose another over her.
You always said I was an actor, baby.
Guess in truth you thought me just amateur.
That you never saw the signs,
That you'd never lost your grip.
Oh come on now, 
That's such a childish claim.

Now I wear the brand of traitor
Don't it seam a bit absurd?
When it's clear I was so obviously framed.
When it's clear I was so obviously framed.

Now you act so surprised.
To hear what you already know.
And all you really had to do was ask.
I'd have told you straight away
All those lies were truth,
And all that was false was fact.

Now you hold me close and hard,
But I was like a statue at mos. 
Refusing to acknowledge you'd been hurt. 

Now you're clawing at my throat.
And you're crying all is lost.
But your tears they felt so hot against my shirt.
But your tears they felt so hot against my shirt.

Well the truth it fell so heavy,
Like a hammer through the room.
That I could choose another over her.
You always said I was an actor, baby.
Guess in truth you thought me just amateur.

Was it you that told me once?
Now looking back it seems surreal.
That all our mistakes were merely grist for the mill.
So why is it now,
After I've had my fill,
Would you steal from me the sorrow that I've earned?

Shall we call this a lesson learned?
Shall we call this a lesson learned?---Lyrics submitted by Mallory.
