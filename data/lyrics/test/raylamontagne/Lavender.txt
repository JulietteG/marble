We lie, under a lavender sky
Under a lavender sky we lie
Do you, do you remember the day?
Do you remember when we felt that way?

Free to play, as a child we ran
Through fields of clover
Underneath the sun

Back there, both of us without a care
Leaves of many colors blown through the air

Free to play, as a child we ran
Through fields of clover
Reaching for the sun

I'll count twenty-five
(No fair, cover your eyes!)
Go on, run and hide
(You'll never find me!)

We lie, under a lavender sky
Under a lavender sky we lie
Do you, do you remember the day?
Do you remember when we felt that way?

Free to play, running circles round
the place we found
that no one ever knew

I'll count twenty-five
(No fair, cover your eyes!)
Go on, run and hide
(You'll never find me!)---
