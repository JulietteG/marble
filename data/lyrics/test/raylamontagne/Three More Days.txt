Three more days,
Girl, you know I will be coming home,
To you darling,

Three more days,
Girl, you know I will be coming home
To you Darling,

I know it's wrong,
to be so far from home, 
I know it's wrong,
To leave you so alone,

I just gotta get you this,
good job done,
So I can bring it on home,
to ya
So I can bring it on home,
to ya

Three more days,
Girl you know I will be right there,
by your side, baby

I know it's wrong,
To leave you so alone,
I know it's wrong,
To be so far from home,

I just gotta get you this,
good job done,
So I can bring it on home,
to ya
So I can bring it on home,
to ya

Gonna bring it on home to ya,
home to ya,
bring it on home to ya,
home to ya,
home to ya,
 home to ya,

left and right,
left and right,

gonna give it to ya,
can't say no,
gonna give it to ya,
can't say no,
gonna give it to ya,
can't say no---Lyrics submitted by Clare.
