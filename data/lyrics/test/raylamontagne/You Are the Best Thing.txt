Baby, it's been a long day, baby
Things ain't been going my way
You know I need you here
To clear my mind
All the time

And baby, the way you move me it's crazy
It's like you see right through me
And make it easier
You please me you don't even have to try

Oh because, you are the best thing
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
Ever happened to me

Baby, we've come a long way, baby
You know, I hope and I pray that you believe me
When I say this love will never fade away

Oh because, you are the best thing
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
Ever happened to me

Both of us have known love before
To come on on promising, like a spring
Then walk on out the door
Our hearts are strong and our, our hearts are kind
Let me tell you just exactly what is on my mind

You are the best thing
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
Ever happened to me

You are the best thing
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
Ever happened to me

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now, now, now, now---
