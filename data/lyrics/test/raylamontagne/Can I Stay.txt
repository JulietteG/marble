Can I stay here with you til the morning
I am so far from home
And I feel a little stoned
Can I stay here till the morning
Theres nothing I want more than to wake up on your floor

Lay with me in your thinnest dress
Fill my heart with each caress
Between your blissful kisses
Whisper "darling is this love"

Can I stay here with you till day breaks
There something you should know I aint got no place to go
Can I stay here with you till the day breaks
How happy it would make me to see your face when I awake

Lay with me in your thinnest dress
Fill my heart with each caress
Between your blissful kisses
Whisper "darling is this love"

Can I stay here with you through the night time
Ive fallen sad inside
And I need a place to hide
Can I stay here with you through the nighttime
Im all alone and blue
Wont you take me to your room

Lay with me in your thinnest dress
Fill my heart with each caress
Between your blissful kisses
Whisper "darling is this love"
Whisper to me "is this love"---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.
