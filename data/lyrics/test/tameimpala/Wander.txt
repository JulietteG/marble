Please don't get answers from eyes
You know that mine can't lie
Quite as well as yours
Just let the spare moment flow
Rounding steps as I go
Through the open doors

Please don't deflate from a sigh
I'd hold still every time but I'd start to shake
I wander around for days
Wondering what I'll say
When they want the truth

You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me

You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me

You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depths of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me

You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me

You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me---Lyrics submitted by Kiddo.
