Time is running out
please don't baby wait
all I wanna know 
lets start today
lost and love a ghost
Lost all alone
guess another lost one hits the door

Just adorable
changes into things
all I wanna know
lets start today
ask em no one knows 
lost on the way
lookin for my lola, just a day

I'll date you
I'll take you on a date
I'm tellin I'll date you
I'll take you on a lovely date
Save the date
Sayin I'll date you
I'll take you on a day date
what is up with that 
lovely day
lovey day

[Chorus] 
I see your body lighting up in the moonlight
As a ghost story you stop in the moonlight
I wanna feel you in the dark when you do right
Do right right there, there yeahhh
As in the dark you light up in the morning
I'm single and I want that by all means
I'm single, and you got what I want that
Want that right there, right there 

Time is running out
please don't baby wait
all I wanna know 
lets start today
lost and love a ghost
Lost all alone
guess another lost one hits the door

Just adorable
changes into things
all I wanna know
lets start today
ask em no one knows 
lost on the way
lookin for my lola, just a day

I'll date you
I'll take you on a date yeah
I'm tellin I'll date you

Save the date
Sayin I'll date you
