Im emotional
Yes its true
Cause ive been lookin for a pretty girl just like you
I get butterflies when we close
I can tell ma how she plays the game, she knows
So im emotional
I cant hide it
Cause she classy but she aint afraid to ride
Shes incompable
Shes a ten
and she plays with all the silly hearts of men

Thats why you
Got me in
The quicksand
The quicksand 
{Cant believe that im stuck}
You
Got me in
The quicksand 
Quicksand 
{Cant believe im stuck}

Im  emotional
Yes its true
Cause ive been lookin for a pretty just like you
I get butterflies when we close
I can tell ma how she plays the game, she knows
So im emotional
I cant hide it
Cause she classy but she aint afraid to ride
Shes incompable
Shes a ten
and she plays wit all the silly hearts of men

Thats why you
Got me in
The quicksand 
The quicksand
{Cant believe that im stuck}
You 
Got me in
Quicksand
Quicksand
{Cant believe im stuck}

Thats why you
Got me in
The quicksand
Quicksand
{Cant believe that im stuck}
You 
Got me in
Quicksand
Quicksand
