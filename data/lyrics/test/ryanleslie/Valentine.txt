Intro:
Valentine, be mine, valentine

V1:
I don't have to say you're beautiful/you've got plenty other guys to say those words for ya/and I don't have to say you run the show/all it takes is a ? and I loose control for ya.

Chorus:
I know...I know you're not my girlfriend but I swear that I love you, baby I do/I know you're not my girlfriend but I swear that I love you, baby I do/that's right.

V2:
I don't have to say you stole my heart/cause anything I have I freely give to you/and
I knew right from the very start/that the only place I belong is next to you/ so even though...

Bridge:
Even through all the ups and downs/you can't stop the way I feel now/even through the storm, joy and pain/I won't change, still feel the same/anytime you call, I don't care/no matter the reason, I'll be there/constantly on my mind/and that's why I'm hoping you will be mine...valentine, valentine, be mine, valentine.---Lyrics submitted by Janelle.
