INTRO:
I light a candle for you tonight (yeah)

Said I reminisce over you babe
Reminisce over you (yeah)

V1:
Listen, I shoulda spent more time
Been a part of your life
And made you more a part of mine, guess it's too late now
Shoulda been a better friend
Ain't done my best to understand you
Still it's hard to think that we're done, we're through

CHORUS:
What would you do
Tell me, if I left you out of the blue
Would you fight back tears while your heart gets torn to pieces
Cause that's what I did when you, left me (when you left me out of the blue)
Love can feel so good and then suddenly it's over, yeah

V2:
I shoulda been more true
Takin better care of you
Like I was supposed to
Guess it's too late now
Shoulda told you how I felt
Instead of thinking of myself
Still I can't believe you went away so soon

CHORUS:
Now, what would you do (you do)
If I left you out of the blue
Would you fight back tears while your heart gets torn to pieces
Cause that's what I did when you (when you left me) when you left me out of the blue
It's funny how love feels good then suddenly it's over

BRIDGE:
Now when I ask myself it's hard to see (hey)
How you could be anywhere but here with me
You said that you needed space and time (hey)
So you would be able to make up your mind
You said if I set you free (hey)
One day you'll be ready to come back to me (yeah)
Did you really mean it (I hope you did) 
Hope you meant it baby

CHORUS:
What would you do (what would you do)
If I left you out of the blue (if I left you out of the blue)
Would you loose your mind and go crazy (cause I)
I almost died when you left me baby (when you left me out of the blue)
Love can feel so good and then suddenly it's over

OUTRO:
So what would you do (what would you do)
If out of the blue I just left you (If I left you out of the blue)
Would it make you cry 
Keep you awake at night
Would it leave your heart sick and lonely
Cause that's what you did baby (when you)
When you left me out of the blue
It's funny how love feels so good and then suddenly it's over

That's right, I light a candle for you tonight babe
Yes I will, yes I will
Cause I'm missing you
So I light candle for you baby
For us, for me and you

La, la, la, la...
