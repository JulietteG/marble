R. Les

V1:
Listen, it was just infatuation, yeah/and I know I shoulda said something/cause you gave up your relations, yeah/so you can have me for your own/ooh, after quite some time/you've gotten restless babe/said you wanted more from me (let me talk about it)/I didn't know what to do/I just turned away/when you look me in the eyes and say.

Chorus:
This is crazy/I shouldn't have to wait (that's what you told me)/I shouldn't have to wait for you/I shouldn't have to wait for your love, no, no/let me save it/I shouldn't have to wait/I shouldn't have to wait for you/I shouldn't have to wait for your love.

V2:
Huh, couldn't see what I was losing, yeah/ what I said I couldn't say that night, huh/and it must have been confusing, yeah/can't imagine what was on your mind/when you began to cry/ooh, after quite some time/you've gotten restless babe/said you wanted more from me/I didn't know what to do/I just looked away/when you turned to me and you said you're sick of waitin.

Bridge:
Oh, I'm not trying be tough/I know what you need and I know I'm not the one/baby trust me/I know I'm not the one to take good care of you/ooh, it's gotta be rough/said I know it tears you up inside/knowing that I can't give you what you need/and I know it's crazy.

Chorus: 2x---Lyrics submitted by Janelle.
