Oh I cant stand to leave that girl alone
And if I explained it till the cows came home
You never understand how I feel inside
Oh so you better get her off my back
Let the monkey ride
Oh let the monkey ride

They say you better let her go, shes no good for you
Oh but I couldnt cut her loose if I wanted to
If the truth be told, I never tried
Oh so you better get her off my back
Let the monkey ride
Oh let the monkey ride

Looks to me shes got me hooked, rest assured there aint no cure
I need a soul where the me I know, cant be denied
Dont you know shes got a hold of my heart
No but dont wait around for us to drift apart
Cause I cant get enough to be satisfied
Oh so you better get her off my back
Let the monkey ride
Oh let the monkey ride

Cause I cant get enough to be satisfied
Oh so you better get her off my back
Let the monkey ride
Oh let the monkey ride---Lyrics submitted by A Chin.
