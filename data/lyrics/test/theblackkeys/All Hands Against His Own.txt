He found all hands against his own 
Found all eyes were looking down 
And the sun had left and gone 
All his friends could not be found 

Don't talk about 
Don't think about love 
She's not the one 
You're dreaming of 
Don't talk about it 
Can't live without it 

You say you're alone 
He found all hands against his own 

He found the sky it turned to grey 
And the clouds start rolling in 
Got no use for what they say 
Got no use for where they been 

Don't talk about 
Don't think about love 
She's not the one 
You're dreaming of 
Don't talk about it 
Can't live without it 

You say you're alone 
He found all hands against his own 
You say you're alone 
He found all hands against his own 
You say you're alone 
He found all hands against his own 
You say you're alone 
He found all hands against his own 

He found all hands against his own 
No light from up above 
Just a dark and lonely road 
He found all hands against his own---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
