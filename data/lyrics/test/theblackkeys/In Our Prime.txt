Pour me down the drain, I disappear
Like every honest thing I used to hear

Like every lover hovers in my mind
We made our mark when we were in our prime
The house it burned, but nothing there was mine
We had it all when we were in our prime

Every now and then I see your face from way back when and I explode
Friends no longer egg me on, they bullshit serenade me like it's gold, how then we're told
I'm praying for some laughter, maybe joy for ever after till I die
I'm hungry for a change, I got my fill of other's pain, I realized
Opened my eyes

Like every lover hovers in my mind
We made our mark when we were in our prime
The house it burned, but nothing there was mine
We had it all when we were in our prime
