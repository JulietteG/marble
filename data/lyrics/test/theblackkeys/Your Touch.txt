What I want, you got it
So much
I'm crazy for

your touch
your touch
your touch
your touch

Well I'll be good
Like i should
Waiting is such
Misery, I need

your touch
your touch
your touch
your touch

Oh lordy lordy
I got excited now
Please rush
I need

your touch
your touch
your touch
your touch---Lyrics submitted by Leigh.
