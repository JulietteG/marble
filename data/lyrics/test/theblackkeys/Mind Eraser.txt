When I need replace her
I am the Mind Eraser
Anything goes, yeah, any-thing goes
Got this sin in our brain
But she aint gonna see me again
See me again, this I know
But oh, deep down I cant let go

Oh, now let it be over, over
Oh, now let it be over, let it be over, over

Seen me stack up my woes
Into a wall, around a rose
Now Im the rose, now she knows
Oh, it hurts so, and I cant let go

Oh, dont let it be over, over,
Oh, oh, dont let it be over, let it be over, oh oh
Oh, dont let it be over, over
No, dont let it be over, over, oh---
