Before she hits the ground
She's going to want to explore
Got to step aside
Never run and hide
She holds it all above us
That beauty head of hers oh
It comes screaming out
In and out of a electric show

She's the worst thing
I've been addicted to
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
I run right back
Run right back to her
I'm going to jump the track
I run right back I'm sure
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her

Well she's a special thing
She doesn't read to much oh
Theirs no doubt
She riped hers out
My misticsterior
She's so superior oh
What she wont allow
I'm a moving know

She's the worst thing
I've been addicted to
Ah no
Oh no
Oh no
I run right back
Run right back to her
I'm going to jump the track
I run right back I'm sure
I run right back to her
I run right back to her
I run right back to her---
