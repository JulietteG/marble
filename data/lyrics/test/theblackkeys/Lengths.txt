tell me where your goin or
what is going wrong
i felt you leavin before
youd even gone

and hold me now
or never hold me again
no more talk
can take me from this pain im in

see the moonlight shinin on
your window pane
see it leave you as
faithful as it came
pleasenyourself so you
dont have to be afraid
make amends
or carry on another way

tell me what you were thinkin
to treat somebody so
the care he took the
lengths to which he'd so

coals are hot to walk
across without your shoes
but in the end
know that you got nothin to lose.---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
