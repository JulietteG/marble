aint it just like dying
except you can still feel the shame
all hands on deck now
the sea is getting rough again

you see him out your window
and even when you close the blinds
cause all you ever wanted
was someone to treat you nice and kind

take a step 
before runnin
take a breath now before you dive
when you run the streets
make sure your sneaker laces they get tied

i'll be a black bird darling
hanging on your telephone wire
flap my wings over you
and set your heart a fire---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
