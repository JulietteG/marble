i was a movin  man
in my younger days
but ive grown out
of my ramblin ways

i left that road
so far behind
and right now baby
i got mine

so baby wheen i rolled
i rolled deep
so much so
i didnt get much sleep

rock and roll hustle
allthe time
and right now baby
i got mine---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
