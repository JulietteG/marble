Though I never met you
And we spoke not a word
I'll never forget you
From the stories Ive heard
For you unknown brother
My baby's mothers pain
Cause your soul is in heaven
But your memory remains

Unknown
Unknown brother
I'll meet you someday
Unknown
Unknown brother
We walk through fields
Where children play

Your eyes shine bright
When you were a kid
Your sisters loved you
And all that you did
Big brother, big brother
Don't worry a bit
Your flame has not faded
Since the day it was lit

Your life was joy
Your mommas only boy
And when the skies are blue
Big brother
Theyre blue for you

We will smile like pictures
Of you as a boy
Before you retired
To Heavenly joy

Unknown
Unknown brother
I'll meet you someday
Unknown
Unknown brother
We walk through fields
Where children play---Lyrics submitted by Daan den Braven.
