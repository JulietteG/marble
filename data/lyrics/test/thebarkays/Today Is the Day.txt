today is the day...
we'll both be walking away..
cuz love is gone
and we have no reason to stay..
no we wont look back..
on the happy times..
we'll just both look ahead 
to peace of mind

so hold your head up high
and try not to feel bad
cuz we gave it our all and all
we gave it all we had
oh baby(oh baby)

goodbye my love
you know that i wish you well
i couldn't give you heaven
so im releasing you from hell

you know that leaving you
is so very hard to do
and by the look in your eyes
you feel the same way too
so hold your head up high
and try not to feel bad
cuz we gave it our all and all and all and all and all and all and all
(whoooooo)


today is the day(today is the day)
we'll both be walking away
cuz love is gone
and we have no reason to stay
we gave it our all and all
we gave it all we had
but love is gone
the love is gone 
and we have no reason to stay
 today is the day
we'll both be walking away
cuz love is gone 
and we have no reason to stay
oh we gave it our all and all
we gave it all we had..........(fade out)---Lyrics submitted by albert.
