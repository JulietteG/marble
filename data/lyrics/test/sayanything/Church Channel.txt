I wake up in a room and realize I'm insane again
This is the fifth time straight in a year I've ended up in here
Eating PBJs and watching the Church Channel nightly
I didn't mind what I did
I fell behind on my nightly four-course meal of rainbow pills
And now I'm wondering what is fake and what is real

But who's that ghost who keeps walking by my door?
I've never seen a girl look so good in thick-rimmed glasses before
And I feel her gaze on me during sleeping hours
And when I shower

They let us play with markers
But I keep trying to draw infinity
And I read the bible to pass the time
But one day out of nowhere
She sits down and looks over my shoulder
I'm shaking harder than I've ever shook before

She sings:
Whoa 
Do you remember me? Is your mind that worn?
We both were born
To be one with that which the public scorns
Though you were forlorn
In despair with your drugs and your hardcore porn
Trust me, those days won't be mourned

So lay your head on me
So lay your head on me
So lay your head onto me
Yeah, lay your head on me

So lay your head on me
So lay your head on me
So lay your head onto me
Yeah, lay your head on me---Lyrics submitted by Marika.
