I recall a time when I was young and those girls blew my mind
I can recollect a summer set in those Northwestern pines

She appeared to me, essentially how we both settles down
How it makes her cry but I'm alive when the whiskey's around

Ooh Heather, sweet Heather
Ooh how I'll never be quite the same

How I never eat, I never see the sun drift out of sight
If you could forget that I'm a wreck when I'm out on that line

Ooh Heather, sweet Heather
Ooh how I'll never quite be the same---Lyrics submitted by Hunter Stephens.
