Walk in the dark to a grave without love
Into the woods where the souls turn to dust
Put them to bed by a quick-hearted man
Placing all the lonely souls into the earth again

No one needs to know about it
It's something that I've done
All the whispers surround me
Could I be the only one?

What would you say if you knew where I've gone?
Could you forgive all the things that I've done wrong?
Put me to bed as a cold-hearted man.
Placing all his lonely souls into the earth again.

No one needs to know about it
It's something that I've done
All the whispers they surround me
Could I be the only one?

Walk in the dark to a grave without love
Into the woods where the souls turn to dust
Put them to bed by a quick-hearted man
Place my soul in the earth again---Lyrics submitted by Hunter Stephens.
