Here she comes in her palanquin 
On the back of an elephant 
On a bed made of linen and sequins and silk 
All astride on her father's line 
With the king and his concubines 
And her nurse with her pitchers of liquors and milk 
And we'll all come praise the infanta 
And we'll all come praise the infanta 

Among five score pachyderm 
Each canopied and passengered 
Sit the duke and the duchess' luscious young girls 
Within sight of the baronness 
Seething spite for this live largesse 
By her side sits the baron 
Her barrenness barbs her 
And we'll all come praise the infanta 
And we'll all come praise the infanta 

A phalanx on camelback 
Thirty ranks on a forward tack 
Followed close, their shiny bright standards a-waving 
While behind in their coach, in fours 
Ride the wives of the king of Moors 
And the veiled young virgin, the prince's betrothed 
And we'll all come praise the infanta 
And we'll all come praise the infanta 

And as she sits upon her place 
Her innocence laid on her face 
From all atop the parapets blow a multitude of coronets 
Melodies rhapsodical and fair 
And all our hearts afire 
The sky ablaze with cannon fire 
We all raise our voices to the air 
To the air... 

And above all this falderal 
On a bed made of chaparral 
She is laid, a coronal placed on her brow 
And the babe, all in slumber dreams 
Of a place filled with quiet streams 
And the lake where her cradle was pulled from the water 
And we'll all come praise the infanta 
And we'll all come praise the infanta---Lyrics submitted by Grace.
