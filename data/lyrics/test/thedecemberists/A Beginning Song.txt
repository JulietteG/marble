[Verse:] 
Let's commence to coordinate our signs 
Get them square to lights 
Get them square to lights 
Condescend the calmest riot in your mind 
Find yourself in time 
Find yourself in time 

[Chorus:] 
I am waiting, should I be waiting? 
And I am wanting, should I be wanting? 
And all around me, all around me 

[Verse 2:] 
Document the world inside your skin 
Tender of your lips 
The tender of your lips 
Doc commence to care each brick of heart 
The sensor on your heart 
Starting with your heart light up 

[Chorus:] 
I am waiting, should I be waiting? 
And I am wanting, should I be wanting? 
And all around me, all around me 

[Bridge:] 
I am waiting, should I be waiting? 
And I am wanting, should I be wanting? 
And all around me, all around me 
I am hopeful, should I be hopeful all around me 
All around me 

[Verse 3:] 
It's it sunlight, it's it shadow 
It's the quiet, it's the word 
It's the beating heart 
It's the ocean... It's the boy 
It's you, my sweet love 
Oh, my love 
And the light, bright light 
And the light, bright light 
Bright light, bright light 
It's all around me 
It's all around me 
It's all around me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
