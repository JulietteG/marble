Gray Jae was a riverchild    
Born down by the river wild    
Said, "hey, what I wanna be nobody's gonna intervene"  

And she wants you
But you won't do    
And it won't leave you alone    
And the rain falls
On the wrong year    
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

Could be that he's into you    
Could be that the obverse is true    
Struck down as a summerchild    
Ten steps just to run a mile    

And he wants you
But you won't do    
And it won't leave you alone    
And the rain falls
On the wrong year    
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

The spirit's willing   
Flesh is getting bored  
Speakers blaring out some long forgotten chord    
Some misbegotten, long forgotten chord    

Sing me some eidolon and I'll sleep all the winter long    
Till then I can only be
Nobody's gonna intervene

And she wants you
But you won't do    
And it won't leave you alone    
And the rain falls
On the wrong year    
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

It won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone---
