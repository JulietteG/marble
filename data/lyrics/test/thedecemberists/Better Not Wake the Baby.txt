[Verse:] 
Giggle hole in the hallway wall 
Singin' like a painted lady 
Use your skull like a cannon ball 
But it better not wake the baby 

[Chorus:] 
How long will this go on? 
How long will it be? 
Bang your drum till the money's all gone 
But it better not wake the baby 

[Verse 2:] 
Make you moan out your rotten lie 
Spit your mind like crazy 
? Your eyes for the better? 
But it better not wake the baby 

[Chorus:] 
How long will this go on? 
How long will it be? 
Bang your drum till the money's all gone 
But it better not wake the baby 

[Verse 3:] 
Drown yourself in crocodile tears 
Curse the god that made thee 
Find a way for your banner years 
But it better not wake the baby 

[Chorus:] 
How long will this go on? 
How long will it be? 
Bang your drum till the money's all gone 
But it better not wake the baby---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
