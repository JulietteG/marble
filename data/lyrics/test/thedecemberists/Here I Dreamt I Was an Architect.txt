Here I dreamt I was a soldier 
And I marched the streets of Birkenau 
And I recall in spring 
The perfume that the air would bring 
To the indolent town 
Where the barkers call the moon down 
The carnival was ringing loudly now 
And just to lay with you 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
Save lay my rifle down 

And try one, and try two 
Guess it always comes down to 
Alright, it's okay, guess it's better to turn this way 

And I am nothing of a builder 
But here I dreamt I was an architect 
And I built this balustrade 
To keep you home, to keep you safe 
From the outside world 
But the angles and the corners 
Even though my work is unparalleled 
They never seemed to meet 
This structure fell about our feet 
And we were free to go 

And try one, and try two 
Guess it always comes down to 
Alright, okay, guess it's better to turn this way 

And here in spain I am a Spaniard 
I will be buried with my marionettes 
Countess and courtesan 
Have fallen 'neath my tender hand 
When their husbands were not around 
But you, my soiled teenage girlfriend 
Or are you furrowed like a lioness? 
And we are vagabonds 
We travel without seatbelts on 
And live this close to death 

And try one, and try two 
Guess it always comes down to 
Alright, it's okay, guess it's better to turn this 
But I won, so you lose 
Guess it always comes down to 
Alright, it's okay, guess it's better to turn this way---Lyrics submitted by Grace.
