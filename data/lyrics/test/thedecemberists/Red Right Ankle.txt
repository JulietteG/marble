This is the story of your red right ankle
And how it came to meet your leg
And how the muscle, bone, and sinews tangled
And how the skin was softly shed

And how it whispered Oh, adhere to me
For we are bound by symmetry
And whatever differences our lives have been
We together make a limb.
This is the story of your red right ankle

This is the story of your gypsy uncle
you never knew cause he was dead
And how his face was carved and Riffed with wrinkles
in the picture in your head

And remember how you found the key
to his hide out in the pyrenees
but you wanted to keep his secret safe
so you threw the key away
this is the story of your gypsy uncle

this is the story of the boys who loved you
who love you now and loved you then 
and some were sweet and some were cold and snuffed you
and some just laid around in bed

and some had crumbled you straight to your knees
did it cruel or did it tenderly
some had crawled their way into your heart 
to rend your ventricles apart
this is the story of the boys who loved you
this is the story of your red right ankle---Lyrics submitted by macy.
