Oh, Philomena, are you in a tawdry gown
Lean to your window, let's slip a ribbon down
If you're to devoid
If only you'll let me go
Down, down down

Long sunny days can lead to lazy vices
Boys all that I know, left to their own devices
Open up your linen lap
And let me go
Down, down down

All I ever wanted in the world
Was just to live to see a naked girl
But I found I quickly bored,
I wanted more, I wanted more

So I'll be your candle and I'll be your statuette
And I'll be your lash and loop of leather
And dark Philomena, if only you'd let me go
Down, down down

All I ever wanted in the world
Was just to live to see a naked girl
But I found I quickly bored,
I wanted more, oh, so much more

So I'll be your candle and I'll be your statuette
And I'll be your lash and loop of leather
And dark Philomena, if only you'd let me go
Down, down down
Go down, down down
Go down, go down---
