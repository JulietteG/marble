I heard those rumours
You'll soon be gone
They say there's no use
In holding on
But I love you so
I will die
If I let you go

Say it's not true
No no no no I'm losing you (I'm losing you)

They say you're cheating
They tell me you lie
But that dont change
The way I feel inside
And if it's so
Then don't tell me
Cause I don't wanna know
Say it's not true
No no no no I'm losing you (I'm losing you)

If I lost you
What would I do?
And after all, all we've been through
Com'on, com'on

Maybe she is only
A passing fade
Well if she is
You go and help yourself a flame
Cause when you're through
I'll be here
Waiting, waiting just for you

Say it's not true
No no no no I'm losing you (I'm losing you)---Lyrics submitted by Shurren Dupree.
