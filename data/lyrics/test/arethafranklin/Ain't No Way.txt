Ain't no way for me to love you 
If you won't let me, no, no 
It ain't no way for me 
To give you all you need 
If you won't let me give all of me 

I know that a woman's duty 
Is to help and love a man 
And that's the way it was planned 
Oh, but how can I, how can I, how can I 
Give you all the things I can 
If you're tying both of my hands? 

Oh, it ain't no way, ain't no way 
It ain't no way, ain't no way 
It just ain't no way, baby, ain't no way 
Ain't no way, baby, ain't no way 
It ain't no way for me to love you 
If you won't let me 

Stop trying to be someone you're not 
How cold and cruel is a man 
Who pay too much for what he got? 
And if you need me to love you, say, say you do 
Oh, then baby, baby, baby 
Don't you know that I need you? 

Oh, it ain't no way, ain't no way 
I'll tell you that it ain't no way, it ain't no way 
It ain't no way, baby, no, ain't no way 

It just ain't no way, ain't no way 
It sure ain't no way, ain't no way 
It ain't no way for me to love you 
If you won't let me---
