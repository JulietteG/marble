I talk to you as to a friend 
I hope that's what you've come to be 
It feels as though we've made amends 
Like we found a way eventually 

It was you who picked the pieces up 
When I was a broken soul 
And then glued me back together 
Returned to me what others stole 

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hurt you 
I don't wanna make you sway 
Like I know I've done before 
I will not do it anymore 
I've always been a dreamer 
I've had my head among the clouds 
Now that I'm coming down 
Won't you be my solid ground? 

I look at you and see a friend 
I hope that's what you wanna be 
Are we back now where it all began 
Have you finally forgiven me? 

You gathered my dreams in 
When they all blew away 
And then tricked them back into me 
You saved me I was almost dead

Chorus

I don't want to hurt you 
Like I know I've done before
I won't do it anymore
