Who would know
All the reasons you're alone
If the seeds were planted firm my dear
Would the banshees tear it all apart

I'll tell you a secret
Let's make this perfectly clear
There's no secrets this year
I'll tell you a secret
I'll make it perfectly clear
There's no secrets this year
So your heart's blown open
Pulsating in your ear
The beat is insincere
I'll tell you a secret
Let's make this perfectly clear
There's no secrets this year

Too late little one
I'm on the run
You think I'm having all the fun
I don't mind
I'm still here
Everything seems perfect from down here
That's the reason you still fear
If the screams are buried oh my God
You'll let the record shake it all apart

I'll tell you a secret
Let's make this perfectly clear
There's no secrets this year
I'll tell you a secret
I'll make it perfectly clear
There's no secrets this year
So your heart's blown open
Pulsating in your ear
The beat is insincere
I'll tell you a secret
Let's make this perfectly clear
There's no secrets this year

Lay your head down at your feet
I'll blow you kisses while you sleep
And when I know you're safe and dreaming
My escape plans in full swing

[Solo]

Who would know
All the reasons you're a bore
If the seeds were planted firm right here
Let the banshees tear it all apart

I'll tell you a secret
Let's make this perfectly clear
There's no secrets this year
I'll tell you a secret
I'll make it perfectly clear
There's no secrets this year
So your heart's blown open
Pulsating in your ear
The beat is insincere
I'll tell you a secret
Let's make this perfectly clear
There's no secrets this year
There's no secrets this year
There's no secrets this year

Better make sure
Better make sure you're looking closely
Before you fall into your swoon---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
