How in the world can i explain
When the words leap off from the page?
Is there a way to celebrate
When I'm scared straight from the past parades?

The kids are throwing all their charms at
The ladies stuck in victory march
With no new trails to blaze

This is my connection
This will leave an impression

How in the world can I compete
With I'm plugged into the new machines?
Lazer focused on the screens
I was lit up with self-esteem

My ears will ring with monotome
When their bodies fill with memory foam
I can't help it, I wanna hear them scream

This is my connection
this will leave an impression

Burn on in
Burn on in

This is not a connection
This is not an infection
This will leave an impression
(This is my connection)---
