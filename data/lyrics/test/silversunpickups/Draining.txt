You ask me to be strong again,
Been waiting out here for a while,
At least so we could be the end,
But not likely,

And it's draining,
And it's draining,

You see my shadow coming in,
Dirty sheets pulled to your chin,
Well maybe now we can be kin,
But not likely,

And it's draining,
And it's draining,
We're evading,
And it's draining,

You asked me before,
You asked me to consider all the waiting,
We've been here before,
We've been here the delivery is no good,

We're leaving lord,
A leaving thats where we start repeating,

Dont ask anymore,
Dont ask me the delivery is no good,

And it's draining,
And it's draining,
We're evading,
And it's draining,

And it's draining,
And it's draining.---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
