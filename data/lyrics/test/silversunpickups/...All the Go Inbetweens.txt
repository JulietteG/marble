Hey man where can i go? 
It's too late to find holes in the ocean i know 
I said man stay here a while 
I'll never find safety in numbers here on the mile 

Say man is this in the right? 
I wanna heal cracks in the sidewalk and keep it alive 
Sat down on the ground and i laid my head down to see 
I closed up my eyes as the numbers went by 
And that's when i started this dream 

Son you're still young but your mind has grown old it 
Seems 
Now go tell your sister to show me her new magazines 

Said man sit for a while 
Son he said son how you've only begun on the mile 

I've been to the moon and the stars and the go 
Inbetweens 
Go tell your sis to stop playing with new machines 

Tell them to keep things quiet 

Man stay here a while 
Son he said son how you've only begun on the mile...---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
