I took my seat and stared 
At the cardboard screen while no one cared 
While the lights stayed on 
The familiar buzz was now long gone 
I just waited there 
As the music soared into the air 
As the lights went down 
She said don't open your eyes 

At tempo 119 
They took to the crowd and aimed towards me 
As the circle closed 
I held onto the one with splintered clothes 
Twenty years before 
She said don't open your eyes and you can swim 
All my friends ignored 
She said don't open your eyes 

Don't open your eyes 
And said goodnight 
Don't open your eyes 
And said goodnight 

I couldn't end it there 
As her wooden bones grew through her skin 
Crumbled naturally 
As her limbs and leaves had broken free 
Twenty years before 
She said don't open your eyes and you can swim 
Wanted nothing more 
She said don't open your eyes 

Don't open your eyes 
And said goodnight 
Don't open your eyes 
And said goodnight---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
