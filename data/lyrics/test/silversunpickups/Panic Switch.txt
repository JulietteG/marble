Time -
It's never worth my time
Blue Shine
Bleeds into my eyes.

I still
Sleep on the right side
Of the white noise;
Can't leave the scene behind.

Could I be anything you want me to be?
If so, is it meant to be seen?

When you see yourself in a crowded room?
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line, or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with the panic?

And I'll try 
To hold on tight tonight.
Pink slip, inviting me inside.
Want to burn skin 
And brand what once was mine,
But the red news came ripping in divine.

If I go anywhere that you want me to go,
How will I know you'll still follow?

When you see yourself in a crowded room?
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line, or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with the panic?

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating.

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and waiting and fading

When you see yourself in a crowded room?
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line, or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with the panic?---Lyrics submitted by Zoey.
