im not losing my war thats in my mind
and i will spread my wings and soar
and i will fly-and no i will never deny
whats in my heart whats in my life will be justified
the mean thoughts and cheap shots they will not weaken me
the mean thoughts and cheap shots well we're not weakening...thats for sure

and i wont be afraid of taking this out
i know ill be safe and sound
cus you will be with me
fighting in all these rounds
and ill shout out so loud
"i know without a doubt that ill be standing there when you go down"
Cus all these things ive seen
well now ill try my best
and you will be with me to never second-guess
and we will show the world
just how we passed this test
and we will show the world we're better than this mess

Cus im not losing my war thats in my mind
and i will spread my wings and soar
and i will fly-and no i will never deny
whats in my heart whats in my life will be justified
the mean thoughts and cheap shots they will not weaken me
the mean thoughts and cheap shots well we're not weakening
The mean thoughts and cheap shots 
and mean lies 
and mean plots 
and mean thoughts 
and cheap shots wont last for long.

Cus all these things ive seen
well now ill try my best
and you will be with me to never second guess
and we will show the world just how we passed this test
and we will show the world we're better than this mess

Cus im not losing my war thats in my mind
and i will spread my wings and soar
and i will fly-and no i will never deny
whats in my heart whats in my life will be justified
the mean thoughts and cheap shots they will not weaken me
the mean thoughts and cheap shots well we're not weakening
The mean thoughts and cheap shots 
and mean lies 
and mean plots 
and mean thoughts 
and cheap shots wont last for long.---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
