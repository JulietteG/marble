Stop the press, everythings a mess
 You can look alive, but you are not at rest.
 And i-ideas are flowing through your head
 A million miles an hour while lying in your bed 
A lucid life you never thought youd lead 
Are you working everyday?
 Are you working just to bleed?
 I know x5

Youre staring at the names of the famed 
that are dipped in gold
 And feeling you deserve what youve heard 
But it doesnt go that way

 Oh, the tongues of men and angels 
I speak but lack love. 
Oh, love, will I stab you in the back?
 Working everyday, 
Im afraid I forgot to show 
whats most important: love

{Chorus:}
 Here I am, dear Lord, tasting hints of fame
 And I dont want it anymore 
If its not you that I gain
 Wanna fall at your feet 
Dont wanna fall from your peace
 I understand 

Have you ever been the man that just ran
 When you knew that God was talking? 
Have you ever heard his voice through the noise
 But just let it go away?

Oh, the tongues of men and angels 
I speak but lack love. 
Oh, love, will I stab you in the back?
 How can I go with mine instead of yours
 When yours is always right 
Im sorry just pour into me love.

[Chorus:]
 Here I am, dear Lord, tasting hints of fame
 And I dont want it anymore 
If its not you that I gain
 Wanna fall at your feet 
Dont wanna fall from your peace
 I understand

A heart at rest is harder now 
Dont let it go away
 Hard earned pay, or hard earned pain
 Right now theyre just the same 
Whats the use, why work so hard
 When its not what you crave
 When what you need is: love. 

[Chorus x2]---Lyrics submitted by Caroline.
