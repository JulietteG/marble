The story of my life I can't quite comprehend
Don't tell me if you know how it ends
When everywhere you go feels like a mirror-maze
and you're not sure how you're stuck in this place
And you got nowhere else to go
and you're lost within your own home
and you're trying so hard to win
You keep trying
It's embarrassing
and how you don't even know
but you know you're off the tracks
How did you get in here?
thinking "how did I get in here?"

I'll help you break the walls down
I'll help you break the walls down
And bust you out
and take you home
believe in me
You are not alone
O'll help you break the walls down

Does anybody know a febraury when
I was hoping by now
we'd be the end of this
When you open a book an read 1000 lines
but you don't really read
you just moved your eyes

And you got nowhere else to go
and you're lost within your own home
and you're trying so hard to win
You keep trying
It's embarrassing
and how you don't even know
but you know you're off the tracks
How did you get in here?
thinking "how did I get in here?"

I'll help you break the walls down
I'll help you break the walls down
And bust you out
and take you home
believe in me
You are not alone
I'll help you break the walls down

I know this is phantom
but just this morning I saw
the sun reflecting off the long window
and I don't kow why
But I thought you should know

When you got nowhere else to go
and you're lost within your own home
you're trying so hard to win
You keep trying
It's embarrassing
and how you don't even know
but you know you're off the tracks
and how did you get in here?
thinking "how did I get in here?"

I'll help you break the walls down
I'll help you break the walls down
And bust you out
and take you home
believe in me
You are not alone
I'll help you break the walls down

And all the weight
you carry
will disappear
and I will willingly
embrace you so
you lay your head
so come on home (3x)

Yeah (4x)---Lyrics submitted by Caitlin.
