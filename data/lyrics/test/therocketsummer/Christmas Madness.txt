1-2-3-hey!

gonna build us a fire tonight
light it up, baby, it's christmastime
got no money but we got our thing
nothing under that christmas tree

but i'll be the one that sings you to sleep
stands by your side believe me
got no presents and got no money
if only

it's christ-a-mas
madness
it's christ-a-mas
i'm on that bad list

my lady wants her wedding ring
spent all my money on a drum machine
we'll be good one day just stick with me
set for life if i can set a few beats

and i'll be the one that sings you to sleep
stands by your side believe me
got no presents and got no money
if only

it's christ-a-mas
madness
it's christ-a-mas
i'm on that bad list

please don't hate me
when i was younger
i had never pictured like this
upon this snowflake
i swear, that i'm gonna make
gonna make your dreams come true
(sweet saxophone sounds)
hey! (x3)

i'll be the one that sings you to sleep
stands by your side believe me
got no presents and got no money
if only

it's christ-a-mas
madness
it's christ-a-mas
i'm on that bad list

oooh--ooh-ooohs

hey!

yeah, hahaha, merry christmas! (:---Lyrics submitted by Paul Herrin.
