It's been two whole years.
Since you and I shared fears.
2:30 am, Talkin till sleep inside that diner.
And now in your eyes I can't find you.

Sorry, That I'm taken aback.
But how I am you never ask.
And I dont need such sympathy.
But a care would be so woah, Woah.

Nice to have once in a while.
You mean more to me than I coud ever tell.
So sorry that I'm taken aback.
But I just can't help it.

Small tale be just right, Holdin onto what we have inside. 
But now it's never there so should I admit.
Do I believe that you're the culprit.
And in you're eyes I can't find you.

Sorry, That I'm taken aback.
But how I am you never ask.
And I dont need such sympathy.
But a care would be so woah, Woah.

Nice to have once in a while.
You mean more to me than I coud ever tell.
So sorry that I'm taken aback.
But I just can't help it.

Oooooo oh oh 
Oooooo oh oh woah

Oooooo oh oh 
Oooooo oh oh woah---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
