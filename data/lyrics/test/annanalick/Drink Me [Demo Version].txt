Talk about the weather
Will you miss me ever?
Lately I'm obsessed
And I need the rest
I hope that you're impressed

She's so pretty I'm jealous
And she's lost like Alice
In a painted past
In a looking glass
I see me looking back

I'll take another Drink Me baby
Slowly I'll disappear
And wear my life like a barbed wire necklace
So let's play truth or dare

So you're a fan of Coltrane?
I wanna be Kurt Cobain
When the truth gets scary
I'll take my gin and sherry
And some Drink Me there'll be
Plath and Joplin with verse
Riding suicide hearse
Kennedy and Monroe
Come to see my rock show
I'll be there in the front row

I'll take another Drink Me baby
Slowly I'll disappear
And wear my life like a barbed wire necklace 
So let's play truth or dare

And I won't be around
To play your games
There will come a day
When you won't know my name
I'll get smaller with every swallow
You'll wake tomorrow 
And things won't be the same

Talk about the weather
Will you miss me ever?
Lately I'm obessed 
And I need the rest
I hope that you're impressed
Because i need the rest
And my head's a mess
I need the rest 
I need the rest
I need the rest---Lyrics submitted by Tiffiany.
