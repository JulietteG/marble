Oh the night, makes you a star
And it holds you, cold in its arms
Youre the one to whom nobody verses I love you,
Unless you say it first

So you lie there holding your breath
And its strange how soon you forget
That youre like stars,
They only show up when its dark,
Cause they dont know their worth

And I think you need to stop following miserys led
Shine away, shine away, shine away

Isnt it time you got over
How fragile you are?
Were all waiting
Waiting on your supernova
Cause thats who you are
And youve only
Begun to shine

There are times when
The poets and porn stars align
And, you wont know who to believe in,
Well thats a good time to be leaving

And the past knocks on your door
And throws  stones at your window
At four in the morning
Well maybe, he thinks its romantic
Hes crazy
But you knew that before
And I think you need to stop following miserys lead
Shine away, shine away, shine away

Isnt it time you got over
How fragile you are?
Were all waiting
Waiting on your supernova
Cause thats who you are
And youve only,
Begun to shine

Yeah, youve only begun to shine

Wont you shine, shine, shine, shine over shadow (oh oh)
Shine, shine, shine, shine over shadow (oh, oh)
Shine, shine shine, shine over

I think
You need to stop following miserys lead
Shine away, shine away, shine away

Isnt it time you got over
How fragile you are?
Were all waiting
Waiting on your supernova
Cause thats who you are
And youve only,
Begun to shine

Yeah, youve only begun to shine
Yeah, youve only begun to shine---Lyrics submitted by Lindsay.
