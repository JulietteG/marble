Owwwwwwwww Scotti let's make it rain on these niggas

[Chorus:]
Yeah I'm in this bitch with the terror
Got a handful of stacks
better grab an umbrella
I make it rain (I make it rain)
I'm in this bitch with the terror
got a handful of stacks
Better grab an umbrella
I make it rain (I make it rain)
I make it rain on them hoes, I make it rain (I make it rain)
I make it rain on them hoes, I make it rain (I make it rain)
I make it rain on them hoes, I make it rain (I make it rain)
I make it rain on them hoes

[Fat Joe:]
Cr-Cr-Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack
you hear the Echo, man I seen the best go, 'cause he ain't have that metal
I'm a Hustler's Hustler, A Pusher's Pusher
you a busta a custerma, I get you sum cooka
Yeah, Crack is a chemist, I pack a 11, I mack in a 7, I'll clap at your reverend
I see you in NY, I'll send you an invite, you're gonna need you a pass that's the code that we live by.

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe:]
OWWWW, Clap, Clap, Clap, Gotta make that ass
Clap, Gotta make that ass,
Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap, Gotta make that ass
Clap, Gotta make that ass
Clap

Now why's everybody so mad at the south for?
Change your style up.. switch 2 southpaw
Jada I was listening (listening), so I made him a anthem 2 make some divendens
Lil mama try 2 hit me with the Shoulder Lean, This Cootco Crack and I control the team
Couple bricks stacked up on that triple beam, my dirty bro' sipping that promethazeen
That Gonja Green that Cali Weed, a nigga lose his life try roll on me
Now, yup, yup we get it, no if's, and's about it
And the rain keep falling even when it's draughted

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe:]
Owwwww mami's body is banging, man, she got it, man, she does it all
She gets it popping with no hands, I'll make it pour
I'll make it rain on 'em I'll lay a game to 'em
I'm gassing misses to tattoo my name on 'em
Gotta get that baby love, gotta get my paper up
Gotta suspect me, exactly test this crack and want a ring on us
And you know what it is, yo, it's them powder kids
And we know how 2 bizz, so we don't give a shit.
