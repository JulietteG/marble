I've been waiting a long time to give you a piece of my mind.
You can run but you can't hide from who you are inside 
and you don't want to confront me.
No! I know your kind. 
You've been runnin the same old lies 
and getting over on young minds.
you'll see it's only a matter of time, you're gonna hafta confront me.

we're all in this game, 
but don't believe that loyalty comes for free.
you only get respect when it's given out.

make no mistake you're the enemy.
make no mistake, you are my enemy.

still here after many hard years.
when will you realize, you can't kill what won't die?
they've tried but the strong survive.
I'm only tellin you one time.
still livin a lie, your bitter crys and words a gettin tired.
how can talk with that closed mind?
you pass judgement, you cross the line
you will never confront me.

cause we're all in this game, 
but don't believe that loyalty comes for free.
you only get respect when it's given out.

make no mistake you're the enemy.
and make no mistake

sick of the back talk?
you don't know me
i never back off, 
cause you're my enemy.---Lyrics submitted by emaree.
