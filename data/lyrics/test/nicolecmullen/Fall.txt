I give up i surrender,i throw in the town 
Exposing my weakness to infinite power 
with all of my weight, i lean heavy on you 
with bags on my back,and in both my hands too 

chorus 
I fall, I fall on you 
I fall, I fall on you 

See my world keeps on spinning,out of control 
And am dizzy from trying,to stand on my own 
But you promised to catch me ,if i tumbled down 
'Cause the way to the sky,starts low to the ground 

chorus 
And i fall, fall on you 
I fall, I fall on you 

bridge 
please dont move,please dont move,please dont move, 
From here, from here(4 times) 

chorus and bridge together---Lyrics submitted by kim.
