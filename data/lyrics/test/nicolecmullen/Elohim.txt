It's been one of those days
Where all my blue has turned to grey
A thunderstorm
Above me forms
And I need sheltering

So Maker of the wind and rain
Can you calm the hurricane
In my soul
Out of control
Or help me face what may

I love you
I want you
I need you right now
I can't live without you
Don't wanna learn how
With all of my heart I surrender I bow
Eliohim
Cover me

No matter how hard I try
Nothing seems to satisfy
The deepest part of my heart 
Where shallowness resides
'Til I'm so desperate I call Your name 
And you revive my soul once again
Of all that I 
Crave inside
This can't be denied

Chorus

Rescue me
Cover me
Forgive me---Lyrics submitted by kim.
