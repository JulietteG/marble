Have you ever noticed 
When i begin to focus 
I reslly wanna show this 
in all that i do 

it's written in the stars 
and shining in the heavens 
no weak infatuation 
for me will do 

Chorus: 
I'm so in love with you 
I'm so in love with you 
I'm so in love with you 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 

Have you ever noticed 
When i begin to focus 
I reslly wanna show this 
in all that i do 

it's written in the stars 
and shining in the heavens 
no weak infatuation 
for me will do 

Roses are red 
violets are blue 
I can't help but smile 
when i think of you---Lyrics submitted by kim.
