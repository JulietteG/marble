Hes never been scared of hard work 
So why are his hands trembling 
And how could something so small 
Be all so weighty 
On the scales of what could be 

This tiny seed has potential 
For a better way of life 
And how he sows it is crucial 
For his little ones, his wife 

Chorus 
So he prays to the Lord of the harvest 
Would you rain down on the least of these 
Would you please multiply and divide them 
These are my sharecropper seeds 
These are my Sharecropper seeds 

It yielded more, than hed ever hoped for 
Enough to take care of things 
Til the landowner came and said, I want more 
And gave him less than agreed 

Chorus 
So he cry to the Lord of the harvest 
Please remember the least of these 
Would you shine on my sons, and my daughters 
Cause these are my sharecropper seeds 
These are my Sharecropper seeds 


So Bring me, my flowers 
While I can see them 
So that I will know the beauty that they bring, that they bring 

Stories like these told to me from my mother 
Of my grandpa and them back when 
She said, most of the good crops, today that I, was reaping 
Were sown in love by them 

So Im praising the Lord of the harvest 
For remembering the least of these 
And Im proud of the title Im wearing 
Cause I am Sharecropper seed. 
Yeah I am the lest of these 
God still cares for the least the sharecroppers seed---Lyrics submitted by kim.
