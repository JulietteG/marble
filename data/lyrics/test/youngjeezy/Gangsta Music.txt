(Verse 1)
I'm here now, you old news
Got a couple porche trucks, couple old schools
I line ya ass up, switch ya tape backwards
Cuz i'm a real nigga, and i don't like rappers
And that ain't this, and this ain't that
And bitch I'm strapped.
Fuck with real niggas that will cut your throat
And they don't drink pepsi, they just sell coke.
All i do is talk doe its like my brains on drugs
You see me out nigga, i do my thing in clubs
Listen up, Jeezy got a little riddle
Stack of twenty dollar bills, two bands in the middle

(Chorus)
All the gangstas they gone ride to this
they gone grind to this
they gone shine to this
this is gangsta music (Repeat 4 times)
All the hustlas they gone ride to this
they gone grind to this
they gone shine to this
this is hustla music (Repeat 4 times)

(Verse 2)
We don't talk on the phone cuz it might stick
Got a play for the seven, call em mike vick
Dirty birds nigga, we play with them falcons
Know some niggas in the cater, that pay for them falcons
Talking young hungry niggas, eat ya whole plate
Jeezy place the order, niggas eat ya whole face
You got me mis construed, all fucked up
Jump out, hit the switch, light ya ass up.
Carbon 1-5, with the hundred round drum
Got plenty for any nigga, think he want some
We don't leave em at the house, we bring em out
My chain for ya life, we can swap em out

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
The hoes love my voice, make they pussy moist
Certified G Shit, I'm the gangstas choice
Niggas poppin off, I hope they bullet proof
Leave holes in ya the size of a sun roof
Mac 11 in the club, and the snub nose
Swear to god, I knock you niggas out ya fucking clothes
Lay ya ass flat, like a door mat
Niggas askin for it, but they don't want that
In the rap game, taking niggas clientelle
White ones like the potta that i used to sell
Give a fuck about a player hater
Hit em with the tube, flush his whole radiator

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Dustin.
