I've often wondered what would I do
If I found you alone like this
Would I remember
What I've got at home
Or forget it all with your kiss
'Cause when you left me
I was hurtin' so
She picked me up off the ground
And I do love her, I want you to know
That I never want to let her down

Chorus
But you still move me
Though I'd never let her know
There's a place inside of me that just won't let you go
And every time I hold her in my arms
Or look into her eyes
I wonder this time, does it show
'Cause you still move me

I guess I'd better leave now
Before it's too late
Before these feelings go too far
But I had to see you
Just one more time
'Cause it's been tearing me apart
'Cause you still move me
And I wonder how much longer can this go on
The feelin' wrong, I know it's wrong
And I don't know which way to turn
Here with you, or home with her

Chorus
But you still move me
Though I'd never let her know
There's a place inside of me that just won't let you go
And every time I hold her in my arms
Or look into her eyes
I wonder this time, does it show
'Cause you still move me
'Cause you move me, God you move me---Lyrics submitted by Dave Ross.
