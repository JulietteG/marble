It was a lovely day for a wedding
And the folks were all dressed in black
When she said "I do," I said "me too"
With a shotgun pointed at my back

I married a moonshiner's daughter
How could I go wrong?
'Cause the moonshiner's daughter cooks up corn and water
And makes me liquor all night long

Well, the preacher was as drunk as he could get, lord
And her brothers and her dad were too, of course
Her mom whispered in my ear, "if she don't satisfy you, dear
Just come on down and get you some at the source."

I married a moonshiner's daughter
How could I go wrong?
'Cause the moonshiner's daughter cooks up corn and water
And makes me liquor all night long

We had our honeymoon in Nashville
Got a room down on Dickerson Pike
When the desk clerk, he asked me, "how old is she?"
I said, "old enough to know just what I like"

I married a moonshiner's daughter
How could I go wrong?
'Cause the moonshiner's daughter cooks up corn and water
And makes me liquor all night long ---Lyrics submitted by Joe Goett.
