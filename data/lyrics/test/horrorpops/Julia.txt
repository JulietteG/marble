She's the one that always stands with a smile 
She's pure and right and 
Bathed in some kind of light 
She's sicker than hell, but always feeling fine 
The whole thing just makes me wanna cry 

Hey hey Julia you're the closest thing to an angel 
That I'll ever find 
My friend Julia, she hasn't got a clue 
But Julia always stay true 

Tall as a mountain, but yet so fine 
Her feet never touch ground 
But that's all right 
I don't understand what they're doing to her 
I wanna scream she's not too good to be true 

Every thing is gonna be fine 
You're gonna be all right---Lyrics submitted by dee.
