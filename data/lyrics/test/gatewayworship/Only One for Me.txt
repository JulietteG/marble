By Your blood You have saved me
With Your love You have brought me close to You
By Your hands You have made me, with one word You amaze me
Forever I will sing Your praise and worship You alone
Until the day I die, I live my life for You
With every breath I take, I bless Your Name and want You more
And now I'm running to You, O Lord

You are the reason my heart can go on and on
You are the life inside of me
You are the answer to my cries, You're all that I could ever need
You are the only One for me

With one breath You sustain me
By Your grace You have given me a hope
To dream of Your intentions to be more like You

Forever I will sing Your praise and worship You alone
Until the day I die, I live my life for You
With every breath I take, I bless Your Name and want You more
And now I'm running to You, O Lord

You are the reason my heart can go on and on
You are the life inside of me
You are the answer to my cries, You're all that I could ever need
You are the only One for me

You are the reason my heart can go on and on
You are the life inside of me
You are the answer to my cries, You're all that I could ever need
You are the only One for me

You are the reason my heart can go on and on
You are the life inside of me
You are the answer to my cries, You're all that I could ever need
You are the only One for me
You are the only One for me
You are the only One for me---Lyrics submitted by Dawang Lester P.
