Behind these prison walls
 doing my paces
Doing my time, I am...
Spending my restless nights, Viosioning faces
Oh they all crying', 'crying'
Prison ah nuh bed a roses
The liveity it makes me ball
I wish that Jah could come and take us back in time
Cause i swear that i can be a better man
Yes i swear, if only you could understand
The faith in meshall set me free reflection (X2)

Behind these metal bars
To Jah Jah I'm chantin'
Pray for your love devine
Im oh so sorry i am
Deeply im hurting
The price ordained to be mine
Impossible to see the changes, that i've made in my life
All they see is just the boy, they left behind
And i swear, that i can be a better man
Yes i swear, if only you could understand
The faith in meshall set me free reflection (X2)

Don't judge me wrong
Cause now i'm stronger
Than i was before
I was young and unwise
Didn't you hear my cry
Impossible to see the changes, that i've made in my life
All they see is just the boy, I left behind
Cause i swear i can be a better man
Cause i swear if only you could understand
I swaer i can be a better man
And i swear(if only you could understand),
I swear, The faith in me shall set me free reflection (reflection)
The faith in me shall set me free reflection (reflection) X3---Lyrics submitted by Siobhan.
