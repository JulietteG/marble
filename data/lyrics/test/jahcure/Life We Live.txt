Every time you take one step
Something pulls you back
But you get back up each time you fall (aye)
Wicked people and bad mind 
Lurking in the dark
But I have no fear I walk with Jah (aye)

Turn the world off  
And turn the music on
Just light up another one
Relax and just close your eyes (oh ooh)
Natural mystic is in the air
Bob Marley says have no fear
Everything is going to be alright
Some days youre up and some youre down
Weak today, tomorrow strong
Some youll lose and some youre going to win (aye)

Thats the life the life the life the life we live
The life the life we live (wooo wooo wooo)

Every time you hear this song
Put your lights up
Keep the fire burning in your soul (yeah)
Good vibrations everywhere
Feel it in your bones
Too blessed to be stressed is what I sing (aye)

Turn the world off  
And turn the music on
Just light up another one
Relax and just close your eyes (oh ooh) 
Natural mystic is in the air
Bob Marley says have no fear
Everything is going to be alright
Some days youre up and some youre down
Weak today, tomorrow strong
Some youll lose and some youre gonna  win (aye)

Thats the life the life the life the life we live
The life the life we live (wooo wooo wooo)

Thats the life the life the life the life we live
The life the life we live (wooo wooo wooo)---Lyrics submitted by natasha sulliva.
