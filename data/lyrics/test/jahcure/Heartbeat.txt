[Intro]

Chorus:

Girl you are my heart beat 
I need to tell you no lie
This time I let lust be
I'm sure its no ala-by
(Repeat)

Verse 1:
Have I ever told you
How much I need to hold you
In my arms and give you the sweet tension
My love will keep you warm
Anytime you need me
Just chant my love baby

[Chorus 2:
Girl you are my heart beat
I need to tell you no lie
This time I let lust be
I'm sure its no ala-by
Over tell our love reach
There's no limit to the sky 
Listen to my speech
and don't you question why

Verse 2:
I need you baby
I know you need me too
Stick together and we can make it through
This love is over dew
Your love is my love
My love is your love
Thats the perfect love
Why won't you smile for me
Let the sun shine for me

[Chorus 1]

Have I ever told you
How much i need to hold you yea
In my arms and give you the sweet tension baby
My love will keep you warm
Whenever you need me
Just chant my love baby

[Chorus 2]
