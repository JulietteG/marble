Some people are dreamers, they live for the future
As if it would work out, just as they dreamed it
Would work out-somehow
Others get caught in, yesterday's papers
Too busy reading, to get on with living
But I live for now

(Bridge:)
I'll climb more than a mountain
Swim more than an ocean
Build up an island
Live for a lifetime

(Chorus:)
Just give me a reason and I'll come running
When I have reasons, I know the way
I'm pointing my feet in the right direction
Give me a reason

Like I'm way too busy, I can't be involved now
And then there's the standby about understanding
But they're wrong somehow
Sometimes it's easy to make up excuses
On the flimsiest pretext and then call them reasons
But where are they now?

(Bridge:)
I'll climb more than a mountain
Swim more than an ocean
Build up an island
Live for a lifetime

(Chorus:)
Give me a reason You got to got to got to 
Give me a reason
and I'll come running
When I have reasons, I know the way
I'm pointing my feet in the right direction
Give me a reason

(Chorus:)
You know you got to give me a reason 
and I'll come running
When I have reasons, I know the way
I'm pointing my feet in the right direction
Give me a reason
Give me a reason---Lyrics submitted by Chip Vandergrif.
