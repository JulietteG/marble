Now greetings to the world,
Vice ala one big gong zilla 'longside skrillex,
And for long!
Oh wait

We mash up the place, turn up the bass,
And make them all have fun,
Ah we-a blaze the fyah, make it bun dem!

We mash up the place, turn up the bass,
And make sure soundboy run,
And we will end your week, just like a sunday!

We mash up the place, turn up the bass,
And make them all have fun,
Skrillex-ah blaze the fire, make it bun dem!

We mash up the place, turn up the bass,
And make sure soundboy run,
And we will end your week, just like a sunday!

Rudeboy!

If you juxtaposin' I wouldn't suppose it,
Get on the floor, let's get on the floor,
Just throw yah paws and bun dah pussy,
Killin' the floor just had a motive,
Kickin' the floor nah we let dah moles in,
Never yah cars and never yah girl, bury yah clart
All of my caka, all of my chart,
Skrillex and gang
There livin' it long,
They getta me public, keeping me strong
They're giving me up, they're giving it long
They're giving it might, whenever your drunk
