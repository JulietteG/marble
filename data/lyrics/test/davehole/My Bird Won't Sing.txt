The world still turns, and the wind still blows
Sun still shines, and the grass still grows

But since youve been gone
Its a curious thing
No my bird wont sing

My dog still barks, and the rooster still crows
My cat still howls, whenever the full moon shows

But since youve been gone
Its a curious thing
You know my bird wont sing

(guitar)

The rain still falls, and the rivers still run
I Wake up every mornin, to that same ole sun

But since youve been gone
Its a curious thing
You know my bird wont sing

I sit down every evening, with a drink or two
I turn on the TV, to catch that same ole news

But since youve been gone
Its a curious thing
Honey you know my bird wont sing

(guitar)---Lyrics submitted by Marc Lager.
