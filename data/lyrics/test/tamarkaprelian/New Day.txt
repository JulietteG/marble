Before the light i found the dark
before tonight i fell apart
frozen up i've realized that something's gotta change

It took a crash to understand
time kept slipping through my hands
i never used to know the sun will shine after the rain

(chorus) Say goodbye, say goodbye
to the way i was before
say hello, say hello
to a new way
i was lost but i found what i was looking for
wakin' up, wakin' up to a new day (to a new day)

I was sleeping in a twisted dream
dying just to make believe
a pretty situation was far from where i was
but i'm not up for giving up
lying down and out of luck
my mistakes are in the open and now i'm finally coming clean

(chorus) Say goodbye, say goodbye
to the way i was before
say hello, say hello
to a new way
i was lost but i found what i was looking for
wakin' up, wakin' up to a new day 

Cause everything, everything
ends
at 
the 
start
I'm healing and feeling
all of my scars.

(chorus) Say goodbye, say goodbye
to the way i was before
say hello, say hello
to a new way
i was lost but i found what i was looking for
wakin' up, wakin' up to a new day 
to a new day
to a new day.

I was lost but i found what i was looking for
wakin' up, wakin' up to a new day.---Lyrics submitted by Kim.
