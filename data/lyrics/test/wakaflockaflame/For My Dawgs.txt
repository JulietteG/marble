FLOCKA
Mentally ill, please someone call a docta
911 its emergency go and get a docta
You dont know by now they call me Waka Flocka
Got a bad habit I might O.D. of yoppas 
Whole bunch of choppas fo my enemies
Devil entered me, my mind on injury
Im in front of the jury like im a guilty
Shawty tried me so i killed em off G.P.
Mom im srry I can't let you bury
Dont worry just comecary
And some letters plus some fone time momma
What's the golden rule dont turn on my partnas

Ima ride Ima ride
Ima live Ima live
Ima die Ima die
Fo my muthafucken dawgs

Ima rob Ima rob
Ima steal Ima steal
Ima kill Ima kill 
Fo my mothafucken dawgs

i heard a lot niggas dissin me 
they let me know they missin me
ive been down for some months
now its time to make history
with these evil ass thoughts
It feel like Satan just entered me
Imma pull through this shit 
i dont need a nigga pray for me
i was told to calm down and spit my pain on da mike
i drop one mix tape 6 months later my career took flight
O' let do it got em hype
luv dem gun sounds make em fight
i go hard in the paint you can tell that on sight
Im da mix tape prince aint no nigga fuken wit me 
Im from Clayton County
Riverdale but born in New York 
Northside Queens to be exact
Bricksquad we a wolf pack
I can taste these niggas flesh 
i can smell these niggas fail 

Ima ride Ima ride
Ima live Ima live
Ima die Ima die
Fo my muthafucken dawgs

Ima rob Ima rob
Ima steal Ima steal
Ima kill Ima kill 
Fo my mothafucken dawgs

They said a man shine proper sometimes that shit hurt
Why put G babyface on a t shirt
Nigga i know it hurt thats just God at his work
Blow all the real niggas livin in da dirt
imma ride imma ride every chance a nigga get 
imma squeeze imma squeeze imma let my gun rip
RIP Trav on some real nigga shit 
real nigga click im on my bricksquad shit
one lousy ass bullet 
cant fucken stop me i feel like Rocky waitin for Apollo Creed
imma certified G Waka flocka to street 
you can call me concrete 
Raised by Grove Street
FLOCKA!!!!!!
Ima ride Ima ride
Ima live Ima live
Ima die Ima die
Fo my muthafucken dawgs

Ima rob Ima rob
Ima steal Ima steal
Ima kill Ima kill 
Fo my mothafucken dawgs
