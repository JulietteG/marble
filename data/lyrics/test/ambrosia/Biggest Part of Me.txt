Yeah, (sunrise) there's a new sun risin'
(In your eyes) I can see a new horizon
(Realize) that will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me

(Stay the night) need your lovin' here beside me
(Shine the light) need you close enough to guide me
(All my life) I've been hopin' you would find me
You're the biggest part of me

Well, make a wish baby
Well and I will make it come true
Make a list baby
Of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk now
In lettin' my love rain down on you
So we can wash away the past
So that we may start anew

(Rainbow) risin' up on my shoulders
(Love flows) gettin' better as we're older
(All I know) all I wanna do is hold her
She's the life that breathes in me

(Forever) got a feelin' that forever
(Together) we are gonna stay together
(For better) for me there's nothin' better
You're the biggest part of me

(Well) make a wish, baby
(Wishin' it will come) true
Make a list, baby
(Make a list)
Of the things I'll do for you
(Ain't no risk now)
In lettin' my love rain down on you
So we can wash away the past
So that we may start anew

[Instrumental Interlude]

(Well) make a wish, baby
(Wishin' it will come) true
Make a list, baby
(Make a list)
Of the things I'll do for you
(Ain't no risk now)
Let my love rain down on you
So we can wash away the past
So that we may start anew
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Beside me) need your lovin' here beside me
(To guide me) keep it close enough to guide me
(Inside of me) from the fears that are inside of me
You're the biggest part of me

(Forever) got a feelin' that forever
(Together) we are gonna stay together
(Forever) from now until forever
You're the biggest part of me
You're the life that breathes in me
You're the biggest part of me---Lyrics submitted by Albert.
