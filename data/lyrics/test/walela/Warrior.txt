Oh I've been searching for my warrior
I've been walking down tracks of time
Such a struggle too seek forgiveness
But chains and shackles these ghosts of mine
Oh Oh oh
Crossing over heavenly seas
where my warrior is waiting for me
Crossing over heavenly seas where my warrior is waiting for me

La la la La
Feels like a message with truth and wisdom
Precious river
you are my guide
These days are sacred
my parts unknown
Oh warrior
Show me the shining light
Oh can you hear me?
I can hear you
For behind the tracks of time
Oh can you feel me?
I can feel you
Feel the power inside my mind

Crossing over the heavenly seas
Where my warrior waits for me
