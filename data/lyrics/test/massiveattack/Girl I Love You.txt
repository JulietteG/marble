Girl I love you
But your loving net's gone forever
Gonna miss you
But my love net's gone forever.

I say I love you 
But your loving net's gone forever
Gonna miss you
But my love net's gone forever.

Girl I'm back in spanish town
Ain't no trouble coming around
You promise you will never let me down
If you love me that much you will stick around.

It's hard to tell that true love exists
But I know this one is for real.

Girl I love you
But your loving net's gone forever. 
Forever.
