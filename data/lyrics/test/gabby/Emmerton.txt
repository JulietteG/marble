You tell me tuh forget
dat my granmudah was born right here so

All right I say I shall go

yuh tell me tuh forget
it is there
I want my own children to grow

All right I say I shall go

But I hope yuh understan'
how I feel
'bout Emmerton
My home land my home land my home land

An uh hope yuh know it's true
dat I will nevuh fuhgive you
Because looka looka wha yuh do
to my Emmerton

you tell me to fuhget
dat yuh bring bull
-dozers an push-down de houses so

Alright I say I shall go

yuh tell me tuh fuhget
yuh bring bull
-dozers an push-down de houses so

Alright I say I shall go

yuh tell me tuh fuhget
dat yu uproot my people
an' scattah dem to an 'fro

Alright I say I shall go

yuh tell me tuh fuhget
dat yu did dem wrong things an
didn't let my children know

Alright I say I shall go

Alright I say I shall go
Alright I say I shall go
Alright I say I shall go ---Lyrics submitted by paul legall.
