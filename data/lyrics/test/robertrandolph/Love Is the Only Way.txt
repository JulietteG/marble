It's a party y'all come on 
Y'all wanna get into it 
Keep ya head up 
Keep ya eyes wide open 
(c'mon brotha brotha brotha) 

Brother sister 
Go ahead again 
Cuz there's a party comin' 
Come on ain't no need to dress up 
Just bring your best lovin 
Come on and step up 
And keep your mind wide open 

Out in the street we'll be dancin 
Out in the street every kiss 
Yes is the only solution 
Love is the only way in
Love is the only way in

Everbody's comin, be sure to bring your friends 
It's gonna be a good time 
Blow your head wide open 
Everbody head up 
This feeling's gonna win 
Said everybody wake up 
Lets get this party goin YEAH 

Out in the street we'll be movin 
Out in the street every kiss 
Yes is the only solution 
Love is the only way in 
Love is the only way in 
Love is the only way in 
Love is the only way in 

Turnin the world one more time 
Turnin the world around 
Turnin the world one more time 
Turnin the world around 
Turnin the world one more time 
Turnin the world around 

Out in the street we'll be movin 
Out in the street every kiss 
Yes is the only solution 
Love is the only way in
Love is the only way in
Love is the only way in
Love is the only way in
Love is the only way in
Love is the only way in
Love is the only solution.---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
