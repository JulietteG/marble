Whenever I'm left in the cold
Whenever there's pain in my soul
Whenever I'm losing control
And feeling like I'm all alone
Whenever I'm lost and confused
Whenever it's hard to break through
The only thing left I can do is run

I run to you always
I run to you always

Whenever I think of your face
When everything's going my way
When I'm having one of those days
When everything falls into place
You've always been right by my side
And I trust you with all of my life
If you're ever in need of me I will run

I run to you always
I run to you always

I run to you, I run to you, run to you

I run to you always
I run to you always

Whenever I'm left in the cold, 
Whenever there's pain in my soul
I run to you, I run to you
Whenever I'm lost and confused 
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I run to you, I run to you

I run to you
I run to you---Lyrics submitted by Laurici.
