[Troy]
The summer that we wanted,

[Ryan]
Yeah, we finally got it!

[Chad]
Now's the time we get to share

[Sharpay]
Each day we'll be together

[Taylor]
Now until forever,

[Gabriella]
So everybody, everywhere

[Troy, Chad, and Ryan]
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together

[Gabriella, Sharpay, and Taylor]
Let's celebrate today
'cause there'll never be another

[Troy, Chad, and Ryan]
We're stronger this time,
been there for each other

[Gabriella, Sharpay, and Taylor]
Everything's just right

[All]
Everybody all for one,
A real summer has just begun!
Let's rock and roll and just let go,
feel the rhythm of the drums
We're gonna have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done!
Everybody, one for all and all for one!
All for one, one!

[Sharpay]
Summertime together,

[Taylor]
Now we're even closer

[Gabriella]
That's the way it's meant to be

[Chad]
Oh, we're just getting started

[Ryan]
Come and join the party

[Troy]
You deserve it, same as me

[Troy, Chad, and Ryan]
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together

[Gabriella, Sharpay, and Taylor]
Let's celebrate today
'cause there'll never be another

[Troy, Chad, and Ryan]
We're stronger this time,
been there for each other

[Gabriella, Sharpay, and Taylor]
Everything's just right

[All]
Everybody all for one,
A real summer has just begun!
Let's rock and roll and just let go,

We're gonna have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done!
Everybody, one for all and all for one!
