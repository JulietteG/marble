Everybody's always talking at me
Everybody's trying to get in my head
I wanna listen to my own heart talking
I need to count on myself instead

Did you ever
Lose yourself to get what you want?
Did you ever
Get on a ride, then wanna get off?

Did you every push away the ones
You should've held close?
Did you ever let go?
Did you ever not know?

I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan
Will I find what I lost? You know you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
(Bet on me)

I wanna make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy that means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

How will I know if there's a path worth taking?
Should I question every move I make?
With all I've lost, my heart is breaking
I don't wanna make the same mistake

Did you ever
Doubt your dream will ever come true?
Did you ever
Blame the world and never blame you?

I will never
Try to live a lie again
I don't wanna win this game
If I can't play it my way

I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am
(Who I am)
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan
(That's my plan)

Will I find what I lost? You know you can
(You know you can)
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
(Bet on me)

I wanna make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

Hold up, give me room to think
Bring it on down
Gotta work on my swing
Gotta do my own thing, hold up

It's no good at all to see yourself
And not recognize your face
Out on my own, it's such a scary place
The answers are all inside of me
All I gotta do is believe

I'm not gonna stop
Not gonna stop 'til I get my shot
That's who I am, that is my plan
Will I end up on top?

You can bet on it, bet on it
Bet on it, bet on it
You can bet on it, bet on it
Bet on it, bet on it

I wanna make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
