Chad:
How did we get from the top of the world
To the bottom of the heap?

Taylor:
I don't recall you mentioning
The boss is such a creep

Zeke:
We still have the ingredients to
Make this summer sweet

Martha:
Well, I got rags instead of riches

Jason:
And all these dirty dishes

All:
Just wish I had three wishes

Gabriella:
(Okay guys, break it up)

Troy:
We've got to work, work
To work this out
We'll make things right,
The sun will shine
If we work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out!

Chad:
(Dude, what have you gotten us into?)

Troy:
(Come on, we can totally
Turn this thing around)

Chad:
I'd rather face a seven footer
Straight up in the post

Taylor:
That sure beats hangin' here

Taylor & Martha:
And burning someone's toast.

Jason:
I needed Benjamins, but
This ain't worth the stress

Kelsi:
Maybe there's a better way
To fix this greasy mess

Troy:
We're a champion team,
A well-oiled machine,
And we've faced tougher
Problems than this.
I know it's a grind, but
I'm sure we can find
A way to have fun while
We get this job done.
We've got to work, work
To work this out

Troy and Gabriella:
We'll make things right
The sun will shine
If we work, work
There'll be no doubt
If we work come together

Zeke, Kelsi, Troy & Gabriella:
If we work this out!

Troy:
(Let's work it!)
Tell me what you want

Gabriella:
Tell me what you need

Zeke:
A little bit of sugar

Martha:
A little bit of butter

Kelsi:
It's the perfect recipe!

All:
Pay day!

Jason:
It'll taste so sweet

All:
Pay Day!

Zeke:
Good enough to eat

Jason:
Gonna make some motion pictures

Martha:
Hit the mall with all my sisters

Zeke:
Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers

Kelsi:
Kick it with the music mixers

Chad:
Buy a ride that suits my style

Taylor:
Lounge around the pool and while

Troy:
Make a date with my favorite girl

Troy & Gabriella:
We've got it made!

All:
We've got to work, work
To work this out
We'll make things right,
The sun will shine
If we work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out!
Work This!
Gotta Work This!
We can work this out! ---Lyrics submitted by Stacie.
