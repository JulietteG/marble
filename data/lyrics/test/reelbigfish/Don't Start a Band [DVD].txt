Intro:
Don't start a band.
Nobody wants to hear, nobody understands.
Don't start a band
You will be so disappointed that it was nothing like you planned.
Don't start a band.
Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah.

Verse 1:
I hate to ruin the magic.
I hate to kill the dream.
But once you've been behind the scenes then you'll know just what I mean.
You might think thats its cool to get up on the stage
and play rock and roll with your heart and soul.
But when no one shows up and your songs all suck
and there's no applause and no flying bras.
No girls will scream for you, and no one's going to sing a long with you.

Chorus:
Don't start a band.
Nobody wants to hear, Nobody understands
Don't start a band.
You will be so damn terrible, They'll all think your shitty and bland.
Don't start a band.
Oh Yeah Yeah Yeah.
Cuz you won't get paid,
And you won't get laid
Yeah Yeah.


Verse 2:
And even if you make it,
On the way to MTV.
I don't think you can take it,
All the bullshit and the greed.
Everyone is so fake when they shake your hand.
and they kiss your ass cuz they're making cash.
And the business end will turn every firend,
to an enemy oh you will see.
They'll turn their backs and they'll be gone,
faster then you can say what did I do wrong?


Chorus:
Dont start a band.
Nobody really cares nobody understands.
Dont start a band.
You will sign you're life away and then you will be working for the man.
Dont start a band.
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Your message will get lost
You will be double crossed.

Verse 3:
And if you think that the joy of playing,
will keep you going through the years.
Wait til you're poor and frustrated,
and the fun just disappears.
Nobody cares what you have to say,
and no one's going to listen anyways.
and rock and roll will bring you down.
And it will kick you while you're on the ground

Chorus:
Dont start a band.
Don't even try, you will regret it yeah.
Dont start a band.
You will be so disappointed that it was nothing like you planned.
Dont start a band
Oh yeah yeah yeah.
Just  give up now,
I'll show you how.

Dont start a band!
Dont start a band!
Dont start a band!
Dont start a band.---Lyrics submitted by ryan.
