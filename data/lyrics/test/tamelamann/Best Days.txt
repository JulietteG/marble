God gave me a future,
He told me that I was chosen,
Predestined, me for greatness,
He gave me victory,
Thou every day may not be sunshine.
Thou seasons change it will be alright.
Daily I'm making confessions.
My faith I decree
Ohhh

I'm forgetting all those things behind me.
So I can focus on what's ahead
I'm believing every thing Gods spoke to me

This will be my best days [repeat]

I will fulfill my purpose
With each step I'm making progress
To stretch my focus
Living out gosd's plan for me

Thou every day may not have sunshine.,
Thou seasons may change it will be alright.
Daily I'm making confessions.
My faith I decree
Ohhh

I'm forgetting all those things behind me so I can focus on what's ahead
I'm believing every thing Gods spoke to me

And these will be my best days [repeat]
I know it will

The best days are ahead of me
My worst days are. Behind me [repeat]

I decree
I declare
From now on
The rest of my days will be my best days
Ohhh
I decree
I declare
From now on
The rest of my days will be my best day

I decree
I declare
From now on
The rest of my days will be my best days
I decree
I declare
Hey, hey
From now on
The rest of my days will be my best days

This will be my best days ---Lyrics submitted by aleari  wells.
