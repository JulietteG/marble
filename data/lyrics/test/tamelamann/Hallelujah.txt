In all my pain, in my distress
Brokenhearted, I try my best
I been battered and tossed by life's raging seas
But I still have my savior who truly loves me

Hallelujah, thank you Jesus
No matter what may come your way
Let's praise Your name glory to you
I will bless Your holy name

Hallelujah, thank You Jesus
No matter what may come Your way
Praise Your name glory to you
I will bless Your holy name

Hallelujah, thank You Jesus
(Repeat)
Yes, Yes, Yes---Lyrics submitted by tikierapratcher.
