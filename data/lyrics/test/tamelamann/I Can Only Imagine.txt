I can only imagine
what it would be like
When I walk, by your side
I can only imagine,
What my eyes would see,
When your face is before me
I can only imagine, I can only imagine

To be surrounded by your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus
Or In awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence
To my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine, yeah, I can only imagine

I can only imagine, when that day comes
And I find myself standing in the Son
I can only imagine,when all I will do
Is forever, forever worship you
I can only imagine,hum, I can only imagine

To be surrounded by your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus
Or In awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence
To my knees Will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine, yeah, I can only imagine

To bow at you feet
I can only imagine, I can only imagine,
