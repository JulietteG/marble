Never knew my life could be this way, mmmm 
I never knew the sun could shine all day 
Never thought I'd live beyond my past 
Until I found Jesus, I never thought I'd be in this place 
Oh I'm glad, so glad, I'm living my life in this place 

Never knew my heart could feel again 
Never knew the pain would let me stand 
Never thought my tears could go away 
Till I found Jesus, I never thought I'd be in this place 
Oh I'm glad I'm living my life in this place 

There's a place in God where we can all be free 
A place where God can get the best out of me 
There's a secret place in God where He covers me 

Never knew my heart could feel again 
Never knew the pain would let me stand 
Never thought my tears could go away 
Till I found Jesus, I never thought I'd be in this place 
Oh I'm glad I'm living my life in this place 

Oh I'm glad I'm living my life in this place 
Oh I'm glad I'm living my life in this place 

Been a lot places seen a lot of faces 
But I never been in this place 
Time and time again never thought I'd win 
But I never been in this place 

This place, this place 
This place, this place 

This place, this place 

Oh I'm glad I'm living my life in this place 
Yes I'm glad I'm living my life in this place---
