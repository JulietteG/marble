I feel your comfort in my dreams
Unprotected silent screams
The light beyond your shadow beams
Still I don't know what it means
When seasons change,
Memories remain
I hold on because I won't let go
Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on because I can't let go
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on

And when the darkness turns to day,
I won't let you drift away
The conscience fades as some let go,
But I hang on 'cause I know
When seasons change,
Memories remain
I hold on because I won't let go
Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on because I can't let go
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on

(Guitar solo)

I hold on because I won't let go
Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on because I can't let go
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
No
No
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on
I hold on
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
Oh, I hold on---Lyrics submitted by Miles.
