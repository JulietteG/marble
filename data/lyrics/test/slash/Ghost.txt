Kill the ghost
That hides in your soul
Rock 'n' Roll
Rock 'n' Roll
Rock Rock

Wipe the blood from your Halo
open wound that you hide your shadow's pride
Spit in the face of the ugly clown
Who'll hunt you down 
But you can't hide
Exterminate the future

Kill the ghost
That hides in your soul
Rock 'n' Roll
Kill the ghost
That hides in your soul
Rock 'n' Roll

Whispers of the future
Broken meth in your skull with a hook in your smile
Exterminate the future

Kill the ghost
That hides in your soul

Kill the ghost
That hides in your soul

You can't run from the future
You can't change the past
You're not that fast 

You can't run from the future
You can't change the past
Not that fast 

Kill the ghost
That hides in your soul

Kill the ghost
That hides in your soul

Kill the ghost
That hides in your soul

Kill 

Rock N Roll
