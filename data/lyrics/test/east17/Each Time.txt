Have you heard of the saying for those who are playing
You don't know what you've got till it's gone
Well that was my calling, i knew i was falling 
Into something that would be so wrong

But i caught hold of myself and changed for the better 
I can't get you out of my mind
Cause something inside made me realize you were fine
Each time when we're alone, i guess i didn't know
How far we were apart, should've spoken to my heart
I guess i didn't know that each time you'd go away I'd cry 
I can't take all these goodbyes 

I know from this feeling, deep inside there's a healing
I know that I'm in control 
Every day I am yearning, this love i feel burning
Burning right through my soul

So let's make a start of something that cannot be broken
The mould is so strong, treat this love like a child
That grows into something worthwhile

Deep, love so deep, deep love so deep, yeah 
i can't take all these goodbyes
Faithfully i will be, you will see, please believe me 
I can't take all these goodbyes

All the time we were alone 
Guess i should've really known
Baby you have always been mine---Lyrics submitted by Bilguun.
