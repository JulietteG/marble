Country music singers have always been a real close family.
But, lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me.
I guess it's because, I kind of changed my direction.
Lord I guess I went and broke their "Family Tradition"

Chorus:
They get on me; they all want to know, 
"Hank, why do you drink?
"Why do you roll smoke?
"Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over, everybody makes my prediction.
So if I get stoned I'm just carrying on an old "Family Tradition"

I am very proud of my Daddy's name.
Although his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same.
Stop and think it over, put yourself in my position.
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a "Family Tradition"

Chorus:
Don't ask me, "Hank, why do you drink?"
"Why do you roll smoke?"
"Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?"

If I'm down in some honky tonk, and some slicks trying to give me friction.
I say leave me alone, I'm singing all night long.
It's a "Family Tradition"

Lord, I have loved some ladies.
And I have loved Jim Beam.
Both of them tried to kill me in 1973.
When that doctor asked me, "Son, how did you get in this condition?
I said, "Hey, Sawbones, I'm just carrying on an old "Family Tradition"

Chorus:
So, don't ask me, "Hank, why do you drink?"
"Why do roll smoke?"
"Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?"

Stop and think it over, try to put yourself in my unique position.
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a "Family Tradition"---Lyrics submitted by scott.
