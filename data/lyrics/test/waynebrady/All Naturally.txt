baby you look so good just like that 
you know 
take off that makeup
let me see your face
look at you

[verse 1]
love to see you in the morning right as you are waking up
sure the last thing on your mind is how good you look
you never have to try hard
you beauty is way off the charts
waking up with you still takes my breath away
cause it's so amazing girl to be with someone like you
outside is stunning just as deep on the inside too
even in tennis shoes and jeans
always look so hot to me
so baby listen carefully

[chorus]
you don't have to wear lipstick
to make come and taste your kisses
and you don't have to get your hair did
i still want to run my fingers all through it
and you don't have get your nails done 
with your girlfriends at the corner store
is not going to make you anymore beautiful
you don't have to wear linger just to impress me 
cause i love you all naturally

[verse 2]
every time you and I go out 
the fellas stop and stare
and i know they see me 
but you just so fine 
you don't care
i never get to upset 
cause girl i know who you're with
matter it validate the way i feel
you always feel think if you're not made up no one will look
but girl you could but makeup out of business for good
cause on a scale of 1 to 10 you're about a one million
so mama pay close attention

[chorus]
i want you girl so naturally (repeat 8x)
