I, I never thought that I would see the day
Assuming I can see
It is shaping up to be a decent one, that is if theres a one
I, Id like to think that I can find your way
If you have it
It, Were not about to waste a single day, you and me
If you wanna fall in love, if you wanna fall in love you can do it
If you wanna be with me, if you wanna see what I can see you can do it
What will happen to me if I lose my name, or is it know the law?
What if I dont get my chance to hug the flame, or even know the spark
Please dont try to be a victor in the end, its not easy
And what kind of law you think you understand, hold my hand
If you wanna fall in love, if you wanna fall in love you can do it
If you wanna be with me, if you wanna see what I can see you can do it
(Guitar solo)
If you wanna fall in love, if you wanna fall in love you can do it
If you wanna be with me, if you wanna see what I can see you should do it
Do you want to know a secret, do you want to see the universe
If you want it, never in a million years never in a million singularities---Lyrics submitted by Jon Olen.
