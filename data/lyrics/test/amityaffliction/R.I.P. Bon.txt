I was waiting for you man, right down there down by the sea where we used to meet, to share in our pain and decry misery.  

I waited I waited I waited I swear, but when I got down to the ocean, man you were not fucking there. 

I just wish that you spoke up and held out your hand because you know I was there man you know that I cared.

I waited for you but you never came, no you never came and now that youre gone I feel Im to blame yeah I feel Im to blame I wanted to hear it, I wanted to know.

Ive been grieving so much with each passing day, but Im angry and hurt and I hate you all the same. I just wish that you spoke up and held out your hand because you know I was there man you know that I cared.

I know now you hated life even more with each breath, I know now that you did not have any fight left, To know you were grieving with each passing day (I know you were grieving with each passing day) and to know most of all you did not want to stay (and I know most of all you did not want to stay) and you know you were grieving with each passing day.  

I waited for you but you never came, no you never came and now that youre gone I feel Im to blame yeah I feel Im to blame did I never listen did I never show, did I never show cause I wanted to hear, I wanted to hear It I wanted to know.---Lyrics submitted by Liam Stokes.
