Listen to an angel sing
Listen to the joy it brings
Out underneath the clouds
I would just shout out loud
Why do i suffer so
Why do i want to go
And dont show me better skies
Until you learn the meaning of trust
Until you learn the meaning of life
Until you learn to live of night and day
You are never going to be alright
So come on and take the stand
And kick him til you think he understand
Until you learn to live of night and day
you are never going to be okay
Until you learn the meaning of life
you are never going to be allright
I am so ?...........?

What do you know about me
How can you possibly see
Without walking in my shoes
You will never taste enough of my blues
So put on your old fur coat its 1973
you will never know enough of us Yes
Until you learn the meaning of trust
Until you learn the meaning of life
Until you learn to live of night and day
You are never going to be alright
Yes So come on and take the stand
And kick him til you think he understand
Until you learn to live of night and day yes
Yes you are never going to be okay
Until you know the meaning of life
you are never going to be allright
Thats no one take a hand
My love
Dont you understend
Yes Yeah

Until you learn the meaning of trust
Until you learn the meaning of life
Yes Until you learn to live of night and day
Yes You are never going to be okay
Yes and come on and take the hand
Yes And kick him til you think he understand
Yes and take another meaning of life
Yes you never going to be allright
Yes Until you learn to live of night and day
Yes you never going to by okay
Yes untill you learn tha meaning of life
Life Life 
Yes and listen to the blues
My ?.........? is ? ............?
