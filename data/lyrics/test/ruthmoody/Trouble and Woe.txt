This world is full of trouble and woe
This world is full of trouble and woe
All I see is trouble, everywhere I go
I'm gonna sing the trouble that I know

This world is full of sadness and tears
This world is full of sadness and tears
They fill us full of sayings, and full of fear
I'm gonna sing until my eyes are clear

Gonna dig deep down into my heart
Gonna dig deep down into to my heart
Gonna dig deep down, I'm gonna do my part
I'm gonna sing, sing a brand new start

This world is full of promise and love
This world is full of promise and love
Promise of a new day with no dark clouds above
And I'm gonna sing that world I'm dreamin' of

This world is full of joy and mystery
This world is full of joy and mystery
This world will be our joy, I believe it will be
When we know what it is to be free

This world is full of trouble and woe
This world is full of trouble and woe
All I see is trouble, everywhere I go
I'm gonna sing, sing my way back home
I'm gonna sing my way back home---Lyrics submitted by Christopher Jones.
