I got to the airport
Just in time for your flight
And I saw a husband run off the plane to his wife
He was full of emotion
Didnt care who could see
Made me stop and wonder whens the last time you looked at me

Like you were a soldier comin home
Like you counted the nights you were gone
Like each moment togethers more precious than ever because youre safe inside of my arms
Like you cant get enough of me when you make love to me like you were a soldier comin home.

Thats when it hit me, just the way she was looking at him.
Caught up in the moment she forgot all the lonely shes been.

Youre gone so much now. Its become no big deal.
Made me stop and wonder whens the last time I made you feel like you were a soldier comin home.
Like I counted the nights you were gone.
Like each moment togethers more precious than ever because youre safe inside my arms
Like I cant get enough of you when I make love to you
Like you were a soldier comin home.

Thats why Im holding you this way
We cant take for granted
Baby lets live every day like you were a soldier comin home
Like you cant wait to get me alone
Like each moment togethers more precious than ever
When youre safe inside my arms.
Like I cant get enough of you when I make love to you.
Like you were a soldier comin home.
Im gonna love you like you were a soldier comin home.---Lyrics submitted by Joanna.
