Three months is a long time if you don' t like it where you are
Three months is forever when the sun don' t shine at all
You might be in love but you just breath to pass the time
But you're so lucky, so lucky to have it all
Someday you' re gonna realize you've been sleepwalking through it all
you've been sleepwalking, get back home
Someday you' re gonna realize you've been sleepwalking through it all
you've been sleepwalking through it all, get back home (sleepwalking through it all)

sleepwalking through it all

sleepwalking through it all

sleepwalking through it all

sleepwalking through it all

Someday you' re gonna realize

Someday you' re gonna realize you've been sleepwalking through it all
you've been sleepwalking, get back home
Someday you' re gonna realize you've been sleepwalking through it all
you've been sleepwalking through it all, get back home

Three months is a long time if you don' t like it where you are
Three months is forever when the sun don' t shine at all
You might be in love but you just breath to pass the time
But you're so lucky, so lucky to have it all
Someday you' re gonna realize you've been sleepwalking through it all
you've been sleepwalking, get back home
Someday you' re gonna realize you've been sleepwalking through it all
you've been sleepwalking through it all, sleepwalking through it all

sleepwalking through it all

sleepwalking through it all

sleepwalking through it all
Pray your soul is mine to keep, I know you can hear me ---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany.
