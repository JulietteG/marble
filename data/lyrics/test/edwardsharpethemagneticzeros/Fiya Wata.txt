I'm sending you all of my love...
You with a heart to feel it 
You in the light and dark 
With the eyes to see it 

Love, 
Go ahead 
Love stand beside us 
Love is within each heart to guide us 
Thank the sun for shining that light 
And lettin' love blaze like 
Fire 
Water 
We're all still learning 
The river forgives, 
All the tides are turning 
Some say the river won't flow 
They say it's gonna stay run dry 
Well, once more the river will flow 
For everytime it was dry 
We'll all be sharing this river of love 
And letting love blaze like fire 

My love 
The sun 
is your reflection 
It's true We're one 
We're all each other 
Lay down your arms 
And know that love will see us all, farther down this river
To a place we've never ever known 
Know 
To night our song will finally know the sound of love delivered 
To its hidin' place beneath the winter snow 
Thank the sun for shining that light...---Lyrics submitted by selma sabbagh.
