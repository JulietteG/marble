Ive seen better days, dripping down your face 
We dont have to talk, lets dance 
For all the times you felt alone, dreaming better 
I see better, better days 
Too dumb to say goodbye thats some clich shit, make me wanna cry 
Just know that every time I look in your eye, I see better, I see better, better days 

Try to remember, that you cant forget 
Down with history, up with your head 
For sweet tomorrow, she never fell from grace 
We might still know sorrow but we got better days 

I seen better ways, some wont believe 
But I dont need much more than faith 
For all the times you felt alone 
Dreaming better, dreaming better, better ways 
Too dumb to say goodbye, now thats some give up shit, make me wanna cry 
Just know that every time I look in your eye, I see better, I see better, better days 

Try to remember, that you cant forget 
Down with history, up with your head 
For sweet tomorrow, she never fell from grace 
We might still know sorrow but we got better days 

Better days. 
Guess whos back in town.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
