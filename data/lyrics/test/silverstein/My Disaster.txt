You crossed the line, you're running in circles
now you've lost all self control!
You medicate so you can fall asleep,
your mind just won't shut down.

I wonder where you are.
I wonder if you've found your other self,
or are you still somebody else?
There's so much bottled up inside,
and it's been shaken up it's going to explode.
You can't stop it, you just can't stop it.

You say you're done
you swear you've gave it up.
Running in circles, you don't even care that you're going nowhere.
You hate yourself.

I still wonder where you are.
I wonder if the thorn's still in your side,
will you pull it out in time?
And now it starts to overflow
and spill its guts and ruins someone's soul.
You can't stop it, you just can't stop it!

You say you're done
you swear you've gave it up.
Running in circles, you don't even care that you're going nowhere.
You hate yourself.

You crossed the line, you're running in circles
now you've lost all self control!
You medicate so you can fall asleep,
your mind just won't shut down.

Let's go!

You are my disaster, I can't stop chasing after.
You are my disaster, I can't stop chasing after.
You are my disaster, I can't stop chasing after.
You are my disaster, I can't stop chasing after.

You crossed the line, you're running in circles
now you've lost all self control!

You say you're done
you swear you've gave it up.
Running in circles, you don't even care that you're going nowhere.
You hate yourself.

You're my disaster, I can't stop chasing you.
You're my disaster, I can't stop chasing you.---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
