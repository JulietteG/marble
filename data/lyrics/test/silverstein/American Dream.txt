It was on our wedding day,
when my heart began to stray.
Never thought I'd make such a big mistake,
throw my life away.

I've gone days without food,
I've went weeks without sleep..
Keeping this in.
I've got cuts that can't close,
I've got wounds that won't heal.
It's all your fault.

I've been shattered and wrecked,
my hands covered in blood..
scars are my skin.
I forgot how to feel,
now I'm weak with deceit.
My skin is paper thin.

We get through this.
Feelin' it, keepin' it, holdin' it in.
We go through this over and over again.

I'd go years without tears in a life with no fears,
a life without you.
Now I'm breaking my back as I cover my tracks.
My skin is paper thin..
once again.

We get through this.
Feelin' it, keepin' it, holdin' it in.
We go through this over and over again.

I've gone days without food,
I've went weeks without sleep..
Keeping this in.
I've got cuts that can't close,
I've got wounds that won't heal.
It's all your fault.

My American dream wasn't ever to lie, steal, or cheat.
He won't leave, All for this
What's the point?

We get through this.
Feelin' it, keepin' it, holdin' it in.
We go through this over and over again. (x2)

This was not a test,
this was all for real. (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Meg.
