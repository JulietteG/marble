I'm not here to judge you,
I'm just here to tell you what you have done wrong.
Beautiful girl looking her best,
takes off a towel, puts on a dress.
Fixes her hair to look good for someone
who waits in a car to go to a motel.
...to a motel.

I may not always be perfect, but I'll always try.

Will you say your prayers just to be honest with yourself?
Will you save your soul? Is this what you wanted all along?

Husband can't bear to just lie to himself.
Stock market falls and he loses it all.
He sleeps alone for the third time this week.
He's become numb, he just wants this to be over,
wants this to be...

I may not always be perfect, but I'll always try.

Will you say your prayers just to be honest with yourself?
Will you save your soul? Is this what you wanted all along?

Blood on the floor,
what have you done?
Heart in your hands,
what have you done?

I may not always be perfect, but I'll always try.

Will you say your prayers just to be honest with yourself?
Will you save your soul? Is this what you wanted all along?
Will you say your prayers just to be honest with yourself?
Will you save your soul? Is this what you wanted all along?
Will you say your prayers just to be honest with yourself?
Will you save your soul? Is this what you wanted all along?
Will you say your prayers just to be honest with yourself?
Will you save your soul? Is this what you wanted all along?

Beautiful girl sleeps by herself.
Half the bed's cold, she knows it's her fault.
She's given in and admitted defeat
but she'll be fine.---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
