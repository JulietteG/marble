You won't repeat this for the rest of the crowd.
I know they will miss but you'll still feel proud.
but you'll still feel proud.

Say it's gold, say it's fine.
The secrets out that you're mine.
Say it's gold, say it's fine.
The secrets out that you're mine.
YEAH!

THAT YOU'RE MINE!

Say it's gold, say it's fine.
The secrets out that you're mine.

The television radiates as the clock ticks on and on and on and on and on.
It's getting too late and it's time to move on. [x2]
YEAH!---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
