Shooting daggers at me
Letting it be known you're not impressed
I never fail at failing all your tests
Don't be so proud
'Cause you're still so scared to be alone
You can change your mind!

You won't embrace this,
but you'll accept it!
You can't let go!

Broken stars
By a single shattered mirror
Seven years of trust
I know you'll never change for anyone
I'll go hard, never lost!

My mind's made up!
And I'll know I'll do the right thing
Get up and stand tall!
My mind's made up!
Why am I scared, I won't be able
To get up when I fall!

We cast a single shadow for so long now
It's so hard to see the sun at all! (The sun at all!)
But you need light to see
The writing on the wall!

My mind's made up!
And I'll know I'll do the right thing
Get up and stand tall!
My mind's made up!
Why am I scared, I won't be able
To get up when I fall...

...into the hole I've made,
I brace myself alone.
I'll find the strength within myself
To climb out on my own. Own!

My mind's made up! (Made up!)
And I'll know I'll do the right thing
Get up and stand tall!
My mind's made up (Made up!)
Why am I scared, I won't be able
To get up when I fall!

These broken stars
Can be put back in the sky!
I still can feel your scars!
I won't, I won't let you die!
We won't, we won't fade away!
Right now, right now,
See this on the glass!---Lyrics submitted by David.
