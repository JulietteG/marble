I never know where I stand.
Which level I belong.
Theres history here, it dies with me,
The show wont go on.
But I always find myself back.
Red to green and in between,
My reputation feeds me.
I still remember my first time with Armor in Hell,
But somehow I planned my escape to Heaven.

I know everything Ive done has lead me here
But Im not scared to go.
Lift up everything I own
And Ill climb up.

Like a fake were the actors
Dishonouring the stage.
But we wont hide our faces.
This masquerade remains to be seen.
So if we die out before we are through,
Did we really believe?

I know everything Ive done has lead me here
But Im not scared to go.
Lift up everything I own
And Ill climb up.

As I pondered in silence, motionless in the Georgian heat
I realized nothing would ever be the same.
And at that moment I knew I could never replicate that feeling
Without destroying something I loved.

Wisdom, justice, moderation.
Slow down when youre trying to speak the words dont come clearly.
The letters spelling out, the spirits spilling out their guts.
Open the doors and show us who we are.

I know everything Ive done has lead me here
But Im not scared to go.
Lift up everything I own
And Ill climb up.---
