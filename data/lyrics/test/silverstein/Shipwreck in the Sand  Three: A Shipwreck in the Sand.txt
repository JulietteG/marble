"Once upon a time, before the lakes and rivers were polluted, before the animals were poached to extinction, and before man had destroyed the earth's atmosphere, there was a great ship. This vessel was to venture into new waters, to find new resources to make life easier and more enjoyable. It was a simple mission for the crew, who were excited to be a part of this union. They pledged to the captain and vow to be there no matter what, in sickness, health, and possible death. As time passed by, there was no new land to be found. As the days grew shorter, and the nights grew longer and colder, the crew became more and more skeptical about the captain's vision. Originally passionate and committed, true and faithful, they now began to revolt."

Cross the line
I was honest and never promised anything
Just a brotherhood to stand for something
And everyone should take the lead
Follow your dreams
If you don't try you fail

And we started
And the captain went over
He asked them why
Their lives had changed
There's no gold to be found
No treasure in the ground
We won't die for this
We won't die for you

You've lost your mind
I was honest and never promised anything
Just a brotherhood to stand for something
And even if they disagree
Follow your dreams
If you don't try, you fail

His dream is now
A shipwreck in the sand
They gave up
Then made all their demands
The storm ensues
57 souls
Die in vain
And what they stole

This union, a battle fought and lost
This union was not about the cause
This union was never about love
This union, this union---Lyrics submitted by Tanner.
