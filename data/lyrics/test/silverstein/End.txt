The first time we met,
Your face became etched
In my mind.
You were the sun,
I was the one who worshiped you.
My hands were your guns!
Your eyes were my muse!

And I knew you could never love me,
I had so much sorrow inside you could never reach,
But can I still keep,
A place in your heart?

You broke my heart,
You promised me the moon and stars,
I fell for your dreams, 
I fell for your lies!
There was no other way,
You know I had tried!

And I knew you could never love me,
I had so much sorrow inside you could never reach,
But can I still keep,
A place in your heart?

There is something I want you to know.
I think you know exactly what it is.
I didn't want to save you.
I didn't want to save you!
I set our house on fire,
To watch it burn!
But I couldn't just leave you!

And I knew you could never love me,
I had so much sorrow inside you could never reach,
But I'll ask you this,
Will you still miss me?
Yes I'll miss you.
Will you love me?
Yes I'll love you!

Lights, fill the sky!
We'll both die tonight, both die tonight!

Lights, from the sky!
Swat us away like flys as we follow the lights!

Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah

Lights, fill the sky!
We'll both die tonight, we'll both die tonight.

Lights, from the sky!
Swat us away like flys as we follow the lights!

Woah,
Woah,
Woah,
Woah,
Woah,
Woah,
Woah,
Woah.
(Both die tonight.) 

(Swat us away like flies.)
(Both die tonight.)
(As we follow the lights.)
(Follow the lights.)

Spoken: 

This union,
A battle fought and lost, 
This union,
Was not about the cost, 
This union,
Was never about love...---Lyrics submitted by Dom.
