A city drenching me in sin
Atop these buildings were both sinking as we swim
In our continual condition

You found a way inside my head
And left me hanging by a thread
Gutted out, replaying every line you said, and thinking
"Why cant I just forget it and why cant I live without you?"
I wish I held my ground or I could just go back
And disappear from you

I let you in you stole a piece of me
And now I cant take it, I can't take it
I can't take it back from you again
You carved my body from the inside out
Never hesitated, hesitated
Left me on the boulevard here to bleed

Your eyes had pureness cutting through
They had me breaking my own rules
Assuring me its okay
This is different, you know were different
Im such a mess Ive tried and tried to unlearn your spell
Uncross the line maintain my confidence outside
But this pain it wont escape me

I let you in you stole a piece of me
And now I cant take it, I can't take it
I can't take it back from you again
You carved my body from the inside out
Never hesitated, hesitated
Left me on the boulevard here to bleed
(Here to bleed)

A city drenching me in sin
Below these buildings Im still sinking as I swim
In my continual condition
Im off the beaten path
Smashing every light I pass
Im so far away, and the darkness makes me need you

I let you in you stole a piece of me
And now I cant take it, I can't take it
I can't take it back from you again
You carved my body from the inside out
Never hesitated, hesitated
Left me on the boulevard here to bleed
You left me here to bleed---
