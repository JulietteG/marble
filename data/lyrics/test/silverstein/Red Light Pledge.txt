The ending's the same, 
past mistakes that you made, 
come back to haunt you, you.

I made a mistake, I wish I could take, 
back everything that I did. 
I wanted to tell you, I really did. 
But how do I explain this? 

Promise me you will be there
Until the red light will change.
I would wait forever. 
Promise me you will stay here 
Until the darkness will fade, 
I'd wait for you, you.

A mistake, wish I could take, 
back everything that I did.
I wanted to tell you, I really did.
But how do I explain? 

Promise me you will be there 
Until the red light will change, 
I would wait forever, 
Promise me you will stay here 
Until the darkness will fade, 
I'd wait for you.

A mistake and I'm all on my own, I'll wait. 
Wait for you. 
A mistake and I'm all on my own, by myself. 
Wait for you.
I'd wait for you... for you
I'd wait for you.---Lyrics submitted by Savacool.
