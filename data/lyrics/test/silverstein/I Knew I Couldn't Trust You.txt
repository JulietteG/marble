I knew I couldn't trust you back when we were kids
You sold me out, you ran and hid
From all your problems, can't even face your friend
Your best friend

You're holding something in tonight
And I can tell you're not alright
Your poker face concealing
All the cards that you're not dealing
Cross your arms, avert your eyes
You're like a child ashamed to cry
The words inside your head
When I find out you'll wish you said:

"I let you down so many times
But I can't ever tell you this!
There is no forgiving it
I promised you I'd always be there
But that couldnt be less true
It's the worst thing I could do"

You're gonna bet it all on black
And when it's gone you'll want it back
Cause truth will mix with reason
And cheating's the ultimate treason
And I could see through you like glass
Slither around below the grass
Garden of Eden burning
Forbidden fruit, you won't discern it

I let you down so many times
But I can't ever tell you this
There is no forgiving it
I promised you I'd always be there
But that couldnt be less true
It's the worst thing I could do

My loss, your gain
Do you love to play this way?
Ill cross your face

Hold in the pain
We're better off this way
We don't explain
We're better off this way
Friends are in vain
We're better off this way
Better off this way

I knew I couldn't trust you back when we were kids
You sold me out, you ran and hid
From all your problems, can't even face your friends
Your best friends

I let you down so many times
But I can't ever tell you this
There is no forgiving it
I promised you I'd always be there
But that couldnt be less true
It's the worst thing I could do---Lyrics submitted by Barbara.
