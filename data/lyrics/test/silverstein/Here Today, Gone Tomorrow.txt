Thirty hours drive from home.
Think I'd feel so alone, that couldn't be less true.
Family travelling by my side.
Lifeline friends we can't deny.
See the world with you.

Here today, gone tomorrow.
We're saying our goodbyes.
Drive away from the past.
Don't be sad, don't feel sorrow.
The memories in our hearts, I won't forget.

An icy road with no remorse.
A metal box drifting off course is taking everything.
I can't believe we lost you,
I can't feel any worse now.
This must be a dream.
When will someone wake me?

Here today, gone tomorrow.
We're saying our goodbyes.
Drive away from the past.
Don't be sad, don't feel sorrow.
The memories in our hearts, I won't forget.

I won't forget.
(It's in our hearts, it's in our hearts)
I won't forget.

All my life, I've never felt so strong as when we're all together.
All my days, I've never felt so powerless when you were taken away.
There's no one in this world with so much love and so much passion.
We'll say goodbye, but we won't forget the liberty and fortitude.

Here today, gone tomorrow.
We're saying our goodbyes.
Drive away from the past.

Here today, gone tomorrow.
We're saying our goodbyes.
Drive away from the past.
Don't be sad, don't feel sorrow.
The memories in our hearts, I won't forget.

I won't forget.
(It's in our hearts, it's in our hearts)
I won't forget.
(It's in our hearts, it's in our hearts)
I won't forget.
(It's in our hearts, it's in our hearts)
I won't forget.---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
