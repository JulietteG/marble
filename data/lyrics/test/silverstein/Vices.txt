You cant see me behind the door
I just heard everything you said
you call him
you're saying all the same things you used to say to me
who is he
I never thought you'd drop that avalanche on me
and be unfaithful
these hotel walls are paper thin
I'm going out

Seven seven with the lime will keep me safe
long enough to stop the though of your embrace inside my head
the lies that I've been fed
throw it back behind my lips the pain is gone
line em up and knock em down the night goes on and on and on to 
let me cope with this disaster

I'm seven deep
her brown hair and blue eyes
looking right at me
who is she
I never thought I'd ever think of stepping out
I'll fight this temptation
this crowded bar is full of sin

Seven seven with the lime will keep me safe
long enough to stop the though of your embrace inside my head
the lies that I've been fed
throw it back behind my lips the pain is gone
line em up and knock em down the night goes on and on and on to 
let me cope with this disaster

I'm not coming home tonight
I'd rather sleep on the street
I'm not coming home to you
I'd wont sleep with the devil

on this city street ill rest my head tonight
I'm going out!

seven seven with the lime will keep me safe
long enough to stop the though of your embrace inside my head
the lies that I've been fed
throw it back behind my lips the pain is gone
line em up and knock em down the night goes on and on and on to let me---Lyrics submitted by David.
