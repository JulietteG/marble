Lying all alone, wishing you would call.
Writing all my thoughts has broken all my bones.
You gave it all up, you threw it all away.
There's nothing I can do.

What do I think you've done?
You know it's even worse than what's in my head.
You don't believe me when I tell you:
I don't want to be a fraud and pretend that everything's fine.
I won't be here when you get home.
I'm not gonna sit here and die!

I'll follow through again this time.
I'll swallow swords, spit out my pride.
I'll be just fine.

You read me like a book
you know I'm running out of legs to stand on.
I won't believe you when you tell me:
These old habits die so hard,
there's no intervention in sight.
There's no point in calling you,
We're just gonna stand here and fight.

I'll follow through again this time.
I'll swallow swords, spit out my pride.
I'll be just fine, fine.
You fill my head with endless lies.
You're killing me, I'm killing time.
I'll be just fine.

So maybe one day the pain will go away
and I will see your face,
I won't even care.
I'm changing all the locks 'cause I can't change you.

I'll follow through again this time.
I'll swallow swords, spit out my pride.
I'll be just fine, fine.
You fill my head with endless lies.
You're killing me, I'm killing time.
I'll be just fine.

I'll follow through again this time.
I'll swallow swords, spit out my pride.
I'll be just fine, fine.
You fill my head with endless lies.
You're killing me, I'm killing time.
I'll be just fine.---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
