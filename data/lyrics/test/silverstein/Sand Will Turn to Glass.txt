I can't believe that I can be
Full of so much hate
Another hero dies, the devil wins
The people hide their shame

Lies were spoken
Bonds were broken
Can he ever change?
Turn your back and
Run away as fast as you can
Don't mark your name

Half a dozen guns
All pointed straight
At the hunted one
A misfired shell
You've shot the
Only thing you love

Lies were spoken
Bonds were broken
Can he ever change?
Turn your back and
Run away as fast as you can
Don't mark your name
Yeah!

Sunshine turns to darkness everyday
The fragile's born from honesty
losing faith

I can't believe
How suddenly
Guilty hearts can mend
I know myself
I've killed and
I'll do it again

Lies were spoken
Bonds were broken
Can he ever change?
Turn your back and
Run away as fast as you can
Don't mark your name
Yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
