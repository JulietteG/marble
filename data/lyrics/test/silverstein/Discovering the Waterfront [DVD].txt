I will promise myself I won't care,
Distracting myself from your stare,
And I have seen this mistake once before,
With your games I will never fall for
I've hung up my guns, I won't kill again!

I'm not gonna forget you
I'm not gonna let you win,
But I'm tired of lying,
Tired of fighting you,
and it's not gonna change
You asked for my heart,
You know that I'm down

But not the way you lie to me
And tear it all apart, and beg for me to stay
I've sailed off to sea, and I'm not coming back! 
I won't forget you, I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying,
Tired of fighting you,
and it's not gonna change

Counting down, make that sound
And you know it  makes no sense
Counting down, til'  you mess around
And I know you can't ever change!

When I'm trembling, thrown overboard
And I'm ready to relive the past 
Counting down, make that sound
Break the silence 

Pretend it's not forever,
I'll pull myself together,
I'll say that I'll forget her,
I'll breathe, and I'll say she never hurt me,
And look at it as learning, 
And laugh about the good and bad!

Because I won't live forever,
We don't belong together,
I know I'll feel better one day
When I can make it through!

I won't forget you, I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying,
Tired of fighting you,
and it's not gonna change
