Burning down, we can't stop it,
We gotta get out, start again,
Our memories are gone forever,
Don't try to turn this around on me,
I'm the one that saved you
This was my own, this was my life
It's not always just about you
And as I heard, the sirens begin to chime,
I can feel my heart begin to race

I can see through the flames that the fire cleanses me,
Mind and soul, now the same
And my body guides the way

I feel you up on my shoulder
Like the angel, like my other
I'm not your hero,
I'll never be what you wanted, what you thought I would be

I can see through the flames that the fire cleanses me,
Mind and soul, now the same
And my body guides the way
I can see through my tired eyes my sickness controls me
Deep inside, I know this is the mother of deceit

And they you were,
6 years old, ashes in your hair,
You're not scared; you've seen so much pain in so few years,
As the world becomes a place where no one wants to stay,
We remain silent until it's too late,

And as I see the flames that go in the sky,
I can feel it coming to the end.

I can see through the flames that the fire cleanses me,
Mind and soul, now the same
And my body guides the way
I can see through my tired eyes my sickness controls me
Deep inside, I know this is the mother of deceit---Lyrics submitted by Tanner.
