and right about now in the motherfucking house
MC Eith DJ Slip, my niggers on the run
(yeah yeah yeah yeah...G'yeah)

(Verse 1)
One more nigger on the run
I just cant handle this, born in the land of the scandalous
thirteen years of age at the time
moms is kicking me, i gots to get mine
i loads up my strap, map out my plan
choose my victum, and motherfucking sticks him
one more point that got scored for the hood

steps is getting low so i gots to get some more
load's up my K, break out the back door
you know the routine so run fool, here we go
say back channal, keep you're motherfucking hands up on the dash
and gives up the cash

(shit) but i aint sweating it because aint shit funny 
because it's all for the money.

(Chorus) 
(G'yeah)
I got's to get mine so im'a take you'res (x2)
(G'yeah

(Verse 2)
Just call me the come up kid

so that means i gotta do what i gotta do
and if you aint down with the hype, fuck you

so when i hit you're corner, you're gonna be a goner
nigger duck when my nine starts to buck (buck buck)
in it for the snaps so i'm crazy as fuck
i should be laying low cause one time is real hot
need to make a nine so i rush you're spot
and it's like that when you got the philly
and if you dont kill, somebody els does the killing
so when you hit the end of the road, aint no turning back
i done signed a hood lifetime contract
jacking and packing cause aint shit funny
because it's all for the money.

(Chorus)
(G'yeah)
I got's to get mine so im'a take you'res (x2)

(Verse 3)
Uh oh, there goes another beep on the beeper
one time sleep on the fucking night creeper
trying to show stop on the sales
pull fake braids but i still gets paid

trying to push the shit because the way is exceed
see me for the blast, five-oh fly in fast
mad cause i'm making more cash then they ask
now i lay low in the cut
lable me the nigger with the fucking gangster strut
every hooptie got gold license plates
my birds fly out through-out the fucking states
now my other half is telling me i'd better quit
but i aint doing this shit, so i guess this is it
i'd be dead before i go out like a dummy
because it's all for the money.

(Chorus)
(G'yeah, G'yeah)
and that's how i'm putting it down, you know what i'm sayin'
like i said before know what i'm sayin', coming from a real compton nigger
MC Eiht, DJ Slip on the run
