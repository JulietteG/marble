Hey hey little razorblade girl you're so so dangerous
You say you wanna try and get away
And that's just so obvious
But I've got the keys so lets put it into drive

Hey hey little razorblade girl you're so so serious
You're only pretty when you walk away
And you act oblivious
But I've got the keys so lets put it into drive

But don't call it a crush, don't call it a crush baby
You know I love you too much
To be crushed like that

Give me back my heart tonight
I'm sick of never smiling cause you're so uptight
Cause we know its not alright
When neither one of us is putting up a fight

And you're right that its wrong
To spend the night alone
You stand on the shore as I'm treading water
and wave as I sink like a stone

Hey hey little razorblade girl you're so so obnoxious
This lucid dream is not reality and it makes me so anxious

Hey hey little razorblade girl you're so so dangerous
You say you wanna try and get away
And that' just so obvious---Lyrics submitted by isabel.
