Written by Craig Finn

2010 Vagrant / Rough Trade



Jessie Im not joking around,
Ive seen that crowd youre hanging with and those kids dont seem positive.
Dont all the cigs make you tired?
You know Id never ask you to change, I only ask you to try.

I know youre gonna do what I know youre gonna do,
But twenty-two and banging round in restaurants
Isnt that much prettier than banging round in bars.
And why do you keep going in* his car?

CHORUS-
I dont want this to stop,
I want you to know,
I dont want you to settle,
I want you to grow! *
Forget all the boys
That you met at the harbour,
Cos you arent ready,
It can only get harder!

Jessie lets go for a ride,
I know a place where we could stop,
I know a place where we could drink
And kiss for a while.
I know a place that always makes you smile.

I know youre gonna say what I know youre gonna say,
I know you look at the ground*,
I know you probably cry.
Youre a beautiful girl
And youre a pretty good waitress,
But Jessie I dont think Im the guy!

CHORUS-
I dont want this to stop,
I want you to know,
I dont want you to settle,
I want you to grow! *
Forget all the things
That I showed you this summer,
Youre too hard already,
Youll only get harder! *

But they didnt name her for a saint,
They named her for a storm!
So hows she supposed to think about
How its gonna feel in the morning?

She said, If heavens hypothetical,
And if the cigs keep you warm
Then hows she supposed to think about
How its gonna move in the morning?
How its gonna move in the morning?!
Dont know how its gonna move in the morning!

Hurricane Jess, shes gonna crash into the heart of the summer,
She doesnt wanna wait until she gets older!
Hurricane Jess, shes gonna crash into the heart of the summer,
She doesnt wanna wait,
She knows it only gets harder!
