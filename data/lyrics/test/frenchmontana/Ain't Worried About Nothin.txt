Strapped up with that Nina (got to)
Bad bitches with me (aye, aye)

But now a nigga wanna touch me

Nigga, I aint worried bout nothin
Ridin round through East Tremont
Nigga, I aint worried bout nothin
Ridin round with that Nina
Ridin round with that AK, that SK, that HK
That beam on the scope
Window down, blowin smoke
Niggas front but they broke
Try shit round me, gon get smoked
That gun automatic
My car automatic
Aint worried bout nothin
