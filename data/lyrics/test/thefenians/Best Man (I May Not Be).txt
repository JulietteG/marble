Well, I am a  man of virtue
Though I've had a lass or two
I am a man of temperance
But I'll have a drink with you
And I'm a man of honesty
But it's so hard to be true
I'll take the Old Religion while
I give the Devil his due

chorus:
Oh, I may not be the best man
But I'm not one to complain
All the boys who care to gripe
Have nothing at all to gain
'cause when by chance it happens
That my sunshine turns to rain
I find a shot of rare old whiskey
Takes away the pain

I love a breath of clean fresh air
Just when I've had a smoke
I don't go much for gambling
Though I am a lucky bloke
I don't mean to insult you
If you can't take a joke
My pockets full of money
By tomorrow you'll find me broke

chorus

Before you go condemning me
Come listen to what I say
'cause way down deep we all long
For the same thing anyway
I'm searching for to find it
'fore life's picture fades to black
To live and love another day
With no troubles on me back
