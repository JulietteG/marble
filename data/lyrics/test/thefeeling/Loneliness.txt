Loneliness
ah-ah-ah
Loneliness
What is the point of it?
Loneliness
ah-ah-ah
Loneliness
Right now
I'll take a penny for my thoughts
Right now
I'm overcharging you of course
Right now
But I've a question for you all
Whose idea was it?
What is the point of it?
I can't carry on this way
Please let me stay, oh babe
We don't have to be this way
Please let me stay
Right now
It claps a thunder in my brain
Right now
My head is spinning with the pain
Right now
It's so illogical and strange
Can't get over it
What is the point of it?
I can't carry on this way
Please let me stay, oh babe
We don't have to be this way
Please let me stay
It started out so well
I even tried to take it slowly
But now you're cold as Hell
That old north wind has blown these flames away
Loneliness
ah-ah-ah
Loneliness
What is the point of it?
I can't carry on this way
Please let me stay, oh babe
We don't have to live this way
Please let me stay, oh babe
It started out so well
Yeah! Yeah!
It started out so well
Yeah! Yeah!
Right now---Lyrics submitted by Natasha.
