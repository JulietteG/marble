You got a way of calling right at the wrong time
I know your southern draw is what trouble sounds like
The way you got me grinning,
You know Ill climb up in your rusty truck
I give up, come on over pick me up
Back porch no lights high beam headlights
Baby you just might make me lose my mind
[You slap me over little love shootin shotgun
Hands out the window got my toes up on the dash
Nothing but fields on the wheels just slinging wet mud
I like the way you drive, just like a rebel child
You make me wanna get barefoot and buckwild]
Youre showin off in circles down by the riverside
You like to make me nervous so I move in real tight
Come on throw it in park
I wanna see the stars and feel the grass between my toes
Dancing to the radio
Oh you got me where you want me, lost in the country
[chorus]
I dont know how you do what you do
But you do what you do and it does what it does to me
I cant stop it once you start it
[chorus]
Wiiiiild, wiiiild, barefoot and buckwild wiiiiiild wiiiiild
Barefoot and buckwild---
