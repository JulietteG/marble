Flowers bloom and there is day and wind and trees and tides
Yet across the sea men know not why they have died..
Still love remains, in some strong heart, keep your mind open.

War is fought with men like chess no consequence of lives
And the only sound thats heard is that of weeping wives
Still love remains, in some strong heart, keep your mind open

Flowers bloom and there is day and wind and trees and tides
Yet across the sea men know not why they have died
Still love remains, in some strong heart, keep your mind open...

Keep your mind open.---Lyrics submitted by Tal.
