Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat down by the sea with her baby
And she didn't know much about anything, but she was, oh, so nice to me

Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat, dressed like a queen, you should have seen
And she didn't care much about anyone, but she was, oh, so nice to me

Jenny, climbing up a flagpole, Jenny, looking through a pothole
Jenny with her hair of fire, how could anyone ever pass by her?

Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat, heavens above, she was in love
And I didn't give a care about anything, but she was, oh, so nice to me
Jenny, climbing up a flagpole, Jenny, looking through a pothole
Jenny with her hair of fire, how could anyone ever pass by her?
Jenny, Jenny
Jenny with her hair of fire, how could anyone ever pass by her?

Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat down by the sea with her baby
And she didn't know much about anything, but she was, oh, so nice to me
Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat, dressed like a queen, you should have seen
And she didn't care much about anyone, but she was, oh, so nice to me

Jenny, climbing up a flagpole, Jenny, looking through a pothole
Jenny with her hair of fire, how could anyone ever pass by her?
Jenny, Jenny
Jenny with her hair of fire, how could anyone ever pass by her?

Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat down by the sea with her baby
Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat, dressed like a queen, you should have seen
Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat, heavens above, she was in love
Jenny Artichoke lived by the sea, Jenny Artichoke said she loved me---Lyrics submitted by Andrew Hetherington.
