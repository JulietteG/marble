She said lets take a ride
Just step inside before we get older
She's got eyes in the back of her head
Looking side to side and over her shoulders
Just tell me what you want to do
Maybe get some food and take in a movie
She said let's dance till the world explodes
And the 50 foot speakers reach overload

She's got me asking to run
Tell me what you're running from
Little runaway
Pain is not the only thing
That will catch up with you one day

with one hand on the wheel
The other's feeling her call
A real gone girl
She's backing her bones up
I said "be careful the life you live can be lonely, lonely."
Set your car in the eye of the of the storm
Maybe nothing's wrong
Just catch up to me---
