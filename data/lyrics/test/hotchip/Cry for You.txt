When I

When I cry for you (no explanation needed)
When I cry for you (it's not debated)
When I cry for you (it's so degrading)
When I cry for you (no hesitation)

And like I'm dreaming on my own
Another dream left all alone
Another reason looking for love
Without a meaning looking for hope

(When I cry for you)

When I cry for you (no explanation needed)
When I cry for you (it's not debated)
When I cry for you (it's so degrading)
When I cry for you (no hesitation)

And like I'm dreaming on my own
Another dream left all alone
Another reason looking for love
Without a meaning looking for hope

I'm just sitting here thinking
Thinking about what I started feeling
When I started myself from crying
Replacing what's lost, or at least trying
Never been so out-of-mind
Never been so into-mind
Never been so wondering why

If this is for the best
If this is for the best
Let's put this to the test
Let's put this to the test
Whatever happens next
Let's put this to the test
Let's put this to the test---
