I can see that you're hurting right now
And no worlds could take away the blazing pain
I know you lost the one you thought was the one
But don't bruise yourself and take all the blame

Chorus
So hold your thoughts, you've lost, you're broken
Don't you know this one was out of your hands?

Can you fight the pouring rain?
Just ask yourself
Giving more than everything
Just ask yourself
Did you let your eyes open?
Did you aware?
So go easy on yourself
Go easy on yourself

You took the break up
And why it went so wrong
On your shoulders, unbearable
Hey you were never meant to carry it on your own
Like you were
The only wan

So hold your thoughts, you've lost, you're broken
Don't you know this one was out of your hands?

Can you fight the pouring rain?
Just ask yourself
Giving more than everything
Just ask yourself
Did you let your eyes open?
Did you aware?
So go easy on yourself
Go easy on yourself

Let the phrases to take these fears
Give it all less
Smile the way it is
Did you love with every breath

Can you fight the pouring rain?
Just ask yourself
Giving more than everything
Just ask yourself
Did you let your eyes open?
Did you aware?
So go easy on yourself
Go easy on yourself

So go easy on yourself
Go easy on yourself---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
