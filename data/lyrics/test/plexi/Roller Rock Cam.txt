Just a chance to say you're wonderful
Without a cut on the mouth tonight
I really don't care if divine intervention
Will keep up what restraint I've learned
I'm falling asleep over contemplation
I'm hoping to spark and turn it with my

Roller Rock Cam
Dual quad, 'tunnel ram

Guess I choked on being beautiful
Guess I tore up the bed we're bleeding on
I really don't care if divine intervention
Will keep me from my own
Just give me some time
I'm at a lack of decisions
I'm hoping to spark and turn it with my

Roller rock cam
Dual quad,'tunnel ram
Oh, you roller rock cam

And I lie in the space we're filling up
I know I strained things one more time
I really don't care if divine intervention
Will keep up what restraint I've learned
Just give me some hope, some strength
And conviction...to finally spark and turn it with my

Roller rock cam
Dual quad,'tunnel ram
Oh, you roller rock cam---Lyrics submitted by sky calen.
