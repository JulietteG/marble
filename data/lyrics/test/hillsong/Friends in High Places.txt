I was in need
and I needed a friend
I was alone
and I needed a hand
I was going down
But someone rescued me
My God cares too much to say
His mercies are new every day
I get down to pray
And then help is on it's way

I walk by faith
And not by sight
If things go wrong
It'll be alright
'Cause someone greater is watching over me
My God cares too much to say
His mercies are new every day
I get down to pray
And then help is on it's way

Now in faith I believe
That I've got everything I need
I walk by faith and not by what I see
I've got friends in high places
I've got someone I can call
I've got someone watching over me---Lyrics submitted by Yeshuan.
