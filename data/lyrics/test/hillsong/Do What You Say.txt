i cry from my heart 
i want to please you lord
to serve you each day 
love you and learn your ways 
you said if i love you 
then i will keep your commands 
you did the father's will
oh your love is so real
to love you lord is to obey 

and my Jesus I'll do what you say 
Jesus I'll do what you say 
Jesus I'll do what you say

your my word is my light 
pure and alive in my heart 
and i know i am 
your hands and your feet to the world 
i pray help me to love 
my brother as my self
you showed the greatest love 
is the life for you friend 

you tell me to go and i will go 
you tell me to stay and i will stay
to hear you say "my servant, well done,
my servant, well done---Lyrics submitted by april.
