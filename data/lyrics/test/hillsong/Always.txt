did you rise the sun for me?  
Or paint a million stars that 
i might know your majesty? 

is your voice upon the wind? 
is everything i've known 
marked  with my maker's fingerprints? 

(chorus)
Breathe on me, 
let me see your face. 

Ever i will seek  you. 

Cause all you are,
 is all i want, always, 
draw me close in your arms, 
oh God, i wanna be with you. 

Can i feel you in the rain?
 Abandon all i am to have
 you capture me again 
 let  me the earth resound with praise 
can you hear as all creation lives to glorify one name?

REPEAT CHORUS:---Lyrics submitted by grellie.
