The future comes alive
You speak Your word and I
I'm running into Your hope
Cause I've seen Your light
You bring my world to life
I'm coming after You love

I'm not shaken
I'm not letting go

And everything comes alive
In my life as we lift You higher
Let Your freedom arise
In our lives as we lift You up
Sing it out
Sing it out
Your freedom is here

So take the limits off
No matter what the cost
I'm running after Your call
And I will run this race
See You face to face
So let Your power overflow

I'm not shaking
I'm not letting go

And everything comes alive
In my life as we lift you higher
Let your freedom arise
In our lives as we lift you up
Sing it out
Sing it out
Your freedom is here
Your freedom is here

I will not fear
I will not hide Your love
Your love
All of my life
I cannot deny Your love
Your love

And everthing comes alive
In my life as we lift you higher
Let your freedom arise
In our lives as we lift you up
Sing it out 
Sing it out

And everthing comes alive
In my life as we lift you higher
Let your freedom arise
In our lives as we lift you up
Sing it out
Sing it out
Your freedom is here
Your freedom is here (times 10)---Lyrics submitted by morgan.
