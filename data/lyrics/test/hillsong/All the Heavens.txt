holy, holy, holy are YOU LORD
ALL THE HEAVENS

Holy holy are You Lord
The whole earth is filled with Your glory
Let the nations rise to give
Honour and praise to Your name

*
Let Your face shine on us
And the world will know You live
***
All the heavens shout Your praise
Beautiful is our God
The universe will sing
Hallelujah to You our King

Coda:
Hallelujah to You our King
Hallelujah to You our King
Hallelujah to You our King---Lyrics submitted by mechelle.
