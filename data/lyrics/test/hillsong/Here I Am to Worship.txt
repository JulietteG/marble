Light of the world You stepped down into darkness 
Opened my eyes let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

[Chorus]
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely 
Altogether worthy 
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days, so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above 
Humbly You came to the Earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

[Chorus]

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
               [x4]

Call upon the name of the Lord and be saved 
                              [x6]

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
                     [x4]---Lyrics submitted by maria.
