For All Youve Done

My Savior Redeemer
Lifted me from the miry clay
Almighty forever I will never be the same
Cause you came here from the everlasting
To the world we live
The fathers only son
And you lived You died
You rose again on high
You opened the way for the world to live again
Hallelujah, for all youve done.---Lyrics submitted by jerome.
