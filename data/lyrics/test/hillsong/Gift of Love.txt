Son of God took on human form,
Heaven's gaze was fixed on a child
Holy One smeared by jealous lies & scorn,
And I am overwhelmed,
And all that I can say is

Thank You for the gift You gave,
Giving what no other could,
Thank You for the gift You gave,
For the radical gift of love.

Son of God nailed upon a cross,
Tender heart was broken for my sin.
Loving face marked with blood and tears and dust,
And I am overwhelmed
And all that I can say is

Thank You for the price You paid,
Paying what no other could,
Thank You for the price You paid,
for the terrible cost of love.

Son of God triumphant from the grave,
Death defeated, hope beyond despair.
Reigning now in righteousness and peace,
And I am overwhelmed,
And all that I can say is

Thank You for Your power to save
Saving where no other could.
Thank You for Your Power to save,
The conquering power of Love. ---Lyrics submitted by roxanne.
