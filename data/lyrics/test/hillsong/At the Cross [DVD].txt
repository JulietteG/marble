At the Cross
                         by hillsong

Oh Lord you've searched me
You know my way
even when I fail You
I know You love me

Your holy presence
surrounding me
In every season
I know You love me
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the Highest Place
what can separate me now?

You go before me 
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
I know you love me

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this 
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the Highest Place
what can separate me now?

You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done (2x) 

And when the earth fades
falls from my eyes
And You stand before me
I know You love me
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the Highest Place
what can separate me now? (2x)---Lyrics submitted by Ann.
