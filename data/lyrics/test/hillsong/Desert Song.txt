This is my prayer in the desert
When all that's within me feels dry
This is my prayer in my hunger and need
My God is the God who provides

This is my prayer in the fire
In weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved
Of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flame

CHORUS:
I will bring praise,
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain,

I will rejoice, 
I will declare 
God is my victory and He is here

This is my prayer in the battle,
When triumph is still on its way
I am the conqueror and co-heir with Christ
So firm on His promise, I'll stand
(Repeat chorus)

REFRAIN:
All of my life 
In every season 
You are still God
I have the reason to sing
I have the reason to worship
(4x)
(Repeat chorus)

This is my prayer in the harvest
When favour and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again
The seed I've recieve I will sow---Lyrics submitted by farrah.
