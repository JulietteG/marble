Your kingdom generation                                                                                          Declares Your majesty  
And our lives
Resounding with Your praise

We see Your spirit moving
We burn with holy fire
your glory is seen through all the earth

You set eternity in my heart
So I live for You
 For You

Hallelluiah, hallelluiah
Honor and praise forever
We'll shout a victory cry from here
To eternity
Hallelluiah, hallelluiah
We'll take a place in history
We'll shout Your awesome love from here to eternity---Lyrics submitted by sheryll.
