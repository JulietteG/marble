We're gonna dance dance dance 
in the freedom we know
we're gonna dance dance dance
in the freedom we know
we're gonna dance dance dance
in the freedom we know
because the freedom we know is gonna last forever

the world turn's in all it's ways
but i'm soul set on a holy name
and when all earth is said and done
still i will praise him

there's no end to the lovew that He gives
and now broken dreams have life again
in the hope of the risen king
so let us praise Him

a mistery unthinkable
thet He took the fall just to save my soul
now to love is the life i know
on and on and on we'll be singin'

soul set free in the one i love
oh come on come on
and let the whole earth sing
in the freedom we know
so come on come on and praise Him

come come all the lost and the found
let us rise up with a holy sound
all the earth unified as one
just to praise Him

in fall view of nothing to hide
like a city on a hill we're gonna shine
in the kight of Your freedom
let us praise Him

we're gona dance dance dance
in the freedom we know
we're gonna dance dance dance
in the freedom we know
we're gonna dance dance dance 
in the freedom we know
because the freedom we know is gonna last forever---Lyrics submitted by Harlene.
