Standing here, in Your presence
Thinking of the good things you have done
Waiting here patiently 
Just to hear Your still small voice again

Holy, righteous
Faithful to the end
Savior, Healer, 
Redeemer and friend

I will worship You  for who you are
I will worship You for who you are
I will worship You for who you are
Jesus  (repeat)
{Bridge}
My soul secure, Your promise sure
Your love endures always (repeat)---Lyrics submitted by cyril.
