All for love a Father gave
For only love could make a way
All for love heavens cried
For love was crucified

Ref:
Oh how many times have I broken Your heart
But still You forgive
If only I ask
And how many times have You heard me pray
Drawn near to me

Chorus:
Everything I need is You
My beginning, my forever
Everything I need is You

Let me sing all for love
I will join the angel song
Ever holy is the Lord
King of Glory
King of all
(repeat ref & chorus [2x])

All for a love a Saviour prayed
Abba Father have Your way
Though they know not what they do
Let the Cross draw man to You
(repeat chorus 2x)---Lyrics submitted by leah.
