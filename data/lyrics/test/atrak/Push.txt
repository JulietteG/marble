(feat. Andrew Wyatt)

Let down, a light that flickers up in the basement
Let down, tonight I feel my courage breaking
I made a mess of easy stuff
I care too much, don't care enough
I wrestle with my attitude
You're mad at me, I'm tired of you

And it's a horrible thing to push
Push, push, push love away
yeah, it's a horrible thing to push
Push, push, push love away

Let down, I feel your disconnect emotion
Let down, you stand there cold and proud
Like I'm not your man
And I feel trapped and gave my word
Not to hang out with other girls
I made you feel like I'm all yours
But I can't stop myself on tours

It's such a horrible thing to push
Push, push, push love away
yeah, it's a horrible thing to push
Push, push, push love away

It's such a horrible thing to push
Push, push, push love away
yeah, it's a horrible thing to push
Push, push, push love away---
