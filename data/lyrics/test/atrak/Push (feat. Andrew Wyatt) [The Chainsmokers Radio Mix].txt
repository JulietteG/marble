Let down, a light that fuckers off in the basement
Let down, tonight I feel my courage breaking
I made a mess
Off easy stuff
I care too much
Don't care enough
I wrestle with my attitude
You're mad at me
I'm tired of you

And it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away

Yeah it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away

Let down, I feel your disconnect emotion
Let down, you stand there cold and proud like I'm not your man
And I feel trapped
And gave my world
Not to hang out
Whit other girls
I made you feel
Like I'm all yours
But I can't stop
Myself on tours

And it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away

Yeah it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away

And it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away

Yeah it's a horrible thing to
Push
Push
Push
Push love away---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
