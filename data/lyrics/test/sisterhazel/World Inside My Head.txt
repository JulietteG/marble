On the road to safe, I kinda tripped along the way
It just seemed like a nasty hastle
The path was greener on the one less traveled
And that's where I remained

People so high they think I can't hear the whispers
I can see if falling of their face
Their trying to shoot down my plane of grace
It seems like it's already hard enough

chorus
But the paint on me is starting to dry and it's not what I want it to be
The weighton me,is hanging on to a weary angel
Tell me what it is about me, where did everybody go without me
So.. I like to fantasize and watch the sunrise like it's a big surprise
Life moved and I stopped to taste it, Drank it up 'til it left me wasted
But my range have bled a softer red, Baby
You should see the world inside my head

Shackled me away and tried to wrap around my dreamer
Feel better when I paint my days with
Purple seas and left out grays
Strange is just a different point of view, whoa

Chorus

Feel Better when I paint my days with
Purple seas and left out grays
Strange is just a different point of view, whoa

Chorus

The world inside
The world inside my head
The world inside
The world inside my head
Inside my head
You should see---Lyrics submitted by Teresa.
