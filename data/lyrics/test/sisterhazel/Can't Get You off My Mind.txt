Didnt think Id see you back in our sleepy town
Its the last place that I thought Id see you now
Your long brown hair, your pretty smile and those bright green eyes
Brought back all those feelins that I tried so hard to hide

And I cant get you off my mind
And I thought Id be alright
But you caught me by surprise, and girl you know I tried
I cant get you off my mind

You look nice, and married life seems to suit you fine
And I know I was lucky back when you were mine
I kept hopin youd come back to me someday
But deep inside Ive always known you were the one that got away

And I cant get you off my mind
And I thought Id be alright
And youve moved on I know, but my heart wont let you go
And I cant get you off my mind

(Instrumental break)

She touched my arm, she kissed my cheek as she said goodbye
And as she walked away, I got that feelin one more time

And I cant get you off my mind
And I thought Id be alright
Its a love I cant replace and a memory that wont fade
I cant get you off my mind
Well I cant get you off my mind

No no, I cant get you off my mind
No no, well I cant get you off my mind
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mhmm---Lyrics submitted by Angie.
