And this kind of love makes me feel ten feet tall 
It makes all my problems fall 
And this kind of trust helps me to hold the line 
I'll be there every time 

This kind of love it's what I dreamed about 
Yeah it fills me up 
Baby it leaves no doubt 
This kind of love it's why I'm standing here 
It's something that we can share 
I can't get enough of this kind of love 

This kind of hope is what I try to find 
And now I can't deny I believe 
And this kind of faith is so unshakeable 
It's unmistakable 
It's bigger than me 

Chorus 

Your love can move a mountain 
It makes my world go round 
It's always there to guide me 
I'm so lucky that I found 

This kind of love is what I dreamed about 
Yeah it fills me up 
Well baby it leaves no doubt 
This kind of love it's why I'm standing here 
It's something that we can share 
I can't get enough of this kind of love 
This kind of love---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
