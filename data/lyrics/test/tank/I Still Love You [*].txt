Oouuouuhh 
(yea uh, c'mon)
heyyeah 
(love baby x3)
I do 
(love baby x2)

Sometimes I swear I hate you
don't know if I can take it
but I can't let you go (I just can't do it baby)
You wear till the shady
straight up it drives me crazy
but I can't let you go (can't do it) hoouho

'cause your body's like
no other body and 
girl you got me
I'm trying to get away
you just keep pushin'
on that good lovin'
(trippin)
I must be trippin' I gotta stay

I still love you
no matter what you do
still love you
I do with you
still love you
oh I feel like I'm dreamin'
still no matter what it takes
(girl)
oh without you the sun don't wanna shine
girl without you I'm just a waste of time
I still I still
I still I still
I still I still I still
still love you

(love baby x3) 
still love you
(love baby x2)

She messed up all my credit
I know I'm gon' regret it
but I can't let her go
(I still can't do it cmon)
oohouuoh

She used to do it dirty
(what?)
found out it almost hurt me
(cmon)
but I can't let her go
(just not)
oohouuoh 

[CHORUS]

You gotta be the crazy yes
try to never sing
but you had a nigger ever since you put that thing on me
I really wanna fight it
but I don't
I really wanna hide it
but I don't

It's a lot of things wrong
but I just kept goin' 
Imma let it rock

'cause your body's like
no other body and 
girl you got me
I'm trying to get away
you just keep pushin'
on that good lovin'
(trippin')
I must be trippin' I gotta stay

I still love you
no matter what you do
still love you
I do with you
still love you
oh I feel like I'm dreamin'
still no matter what it takes
(girl)
oh without you the sun don't wanna shine
(girl) without you I'm just a waste of time
I still I still
I still I still
I still I still I still
( I still still love you)
still love you

(love baby x3) 
still love you
(love baby x2)
x3

girl without you x2---Lyrics submitted by Vivian.
