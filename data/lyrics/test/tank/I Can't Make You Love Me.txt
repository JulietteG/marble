Ooooohhhh.....................
Yeahhhhhhh....................
Nooo...


Turn down the light, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head

Lay down with me, and tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize..... me

(Chours)

Cause i can't make you love me if 
you don't, you don't
You cant make your heart feel something
it won't

Here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart and till
i feel the power
But, you don't, no you won't

Cause you can't make me love you



(Verse 2)

I'll close my eyes, then i won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding
me
Morning will come and i'll do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
and i will give up this fight....


(Chours)

Cause i can't make you love me if 
you don't, you don't
You cant make your heart feel something
it won't

Here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart and till
i feel the power
But, you don't, no you won't

Cause you can't make me love you


(Verse 3)


Just let me hold you baby 
one more time and maybe
tonight i can change my mind
and make a love like the day before
BAby feeling in your heart
you can't ignore

I really baby we can make this right
If you just give me one more night
I think that we would, and I feel
we deserve
If you feel the we don't have the
change tonight


(Chours)

Cause i can't make you love me if 
you don't, you don't
You cant make your heart feel something
it won't

Here in the dark
In these final hours
I will lay down my heart and till
i feel the power
But, you don't, no you won't

Cause you can't make me love you---Lyrics submitted by LJ.
