Oh, yeah,
yeah Did you see this scars,
trying to get through this flesh
Making its way to my heart
Wanting to destroy what's left.
Watch your soul... what at the start
of destruction at its best
Is that why you appeared, cause I what you felt
Cause I can feel your love is pulling me back
Brick by brick, your love is building me up
You're still so perfect, yeah

Now, look at me, I'm stronger than I've ever been, eh!
Where I am is no longer where I've been, oh..
Now, look at me, I'm stronger than I've ever been, oooooh!
I'm stronger and it's all...
All because of you
All because of you

Wait till you see my smile,
Wait till you see what's next
Wait till you see this light
that's burning through my chest
Hey, watch how high I fly,
How fast this feeling spreads Oooh,
never ever would have hoped this would all be
available to me again
Oh, but then I felt your love! It's putting me back
brick by brick, your love has built me up
You're still so perfect, yeah

Now, look at me, I'm stronger than I've ever been, eh!
Where I am is no longer where I've been, oh..
Now, look at me, I'm stronger than I've ever been,
yeah eeh yeah yeah
I'm stronger and it's all
All because of

You've taken everywhere I've been
And promise that I never have to go there again, again
Now This time we gon' get away
Cause I'm stronger than I've ever been, eh!
Where I am is no longer where I've been ..oh
Now, look at me, I'm stronger than I've ever been,
ooh ooh ooh aah!
I'm stronger and it's all
All because of you
All because of you! I'm stronger

But I'm stronger!
I'm still missing pieces after everything
But I'm stronger! Can't believe it 'coz she said she'd never leave
But I'm stronger!
But if she'd never left, I would have never seen
That I'm stronger!
You made me, you made me stronger! (You made me)
Strong, strong, strong! Oh, oh, oh stronger! ---
