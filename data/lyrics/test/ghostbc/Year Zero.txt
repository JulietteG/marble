Since dawn of time the fate of man is that of mice 
Equal as parasites and moving without eyes 
A day of reckoning when man exists to burn 
Countdown together now and say the words that you heard 

Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero 
Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero 

Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer 

Crestfallen kings and queens comforting in their faith 
Unbeknownst to them is the presence of the wraith 
Since fate of man is equal to the fate of lies 
As new dawn rises you shall recognize now the overlord 

Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero 
Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero 
Hail Satan 

(guitar solo) 

He will travel the nations. 
kingdoms to fall one by one 
Victim to fall for temptations 
A daughter to fall for a son 
The ancient serpent deceiver 
To masses standing in awe 
He will ascend to the heavens 
Above the stars of god. 

Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero 
Hail Satan, Archangelo 
Hail Satan, Welcome year zero"---Lyrics submitted by Tristan Streetman.
