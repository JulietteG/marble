We fall down, and get back up
We hold each other, fall in love
Now we're walking, your steps and mine
Back and forth, side by side

When I met you, right then I knew
If I ever had the chance, I would ask you
To spend a little time, your heart and mine
Back and forth, side by side

Oh you're really something good
Hey you're really something true to me
Oh you're really something else 

Now you're asking, what I believe in
What's the plan, for our lives
I hear you, I hear you
Beside me breathing
I got your back, by your side

When we make love
We make love
When we make love, we make love
Here beside you, eye to eye with you
Back and forth, side by side

Oh you're really something good
Hey you're really something true to me
Oh you're really something else

Baby I do
You never really know
Baby I do, I do, I do
You never really know
Baby I do
You never really know what's happening
Baby I do
You never really know
Baby I do, I do, I do
You never really know
Baby I do
You never really know what's happening
Baby I do
You never really know
Baby I do, I do, I do
You never really know
Baby I do
You never really know what's happening
Baby I do
You never really know
Baby I do, I do, I do
You never really know
Baby I do
Baby I do, I do love you---Lyrics submitted by Britani.
