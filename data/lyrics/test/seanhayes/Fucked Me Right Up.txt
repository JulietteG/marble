Don't know that she knows
What it is she doing
Don't know that she knows
How deep this will cut
Can't believe you really think
We'll make it through this oh
You fucked me right up
Just fucked me right up


All alone in a house that we were living
All that love just walked out the door
She's off running around
With a brand new man, oh
You fucked me right up
Just fucked me right up


I got a long way to travel
With a heaviness taking hold
It takes along night
When you unravel at home


Don't know that she knows
What it is she doing
Don't know that she knows
We're throwing it all away
Tell me how you think
We're gonna make it through this oh
You fucked me right up
Just fucked me right up


Don't know that she knows
Or even if it matters
The cut's been made
The dice have been thrown


What was our love worth
If it's something we could gamble oh
You fucked me right up
Just Fucked me right up


I got a long way to travel
With a heaviness taking hold
It takes a long night
When you unravel at home


Goodbye x24(24times)

You fucked me right up
Jut fucked me right up---Lyrics submitted by Britani.
