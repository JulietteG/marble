I love the walking dead
No, I really do
Don't they get up anyway? Never be a bore
They know where they are
They know where they are

My lover was a zombie
She knew where she was
They killed her things, they couldn't kill her dreams
She knew where she was

I've been so sickly lately
I could use some artificial air
It gets stuffy in the lab
So if I find a human breathing
I might suck it out of them.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck Aeschbacher Jr.
