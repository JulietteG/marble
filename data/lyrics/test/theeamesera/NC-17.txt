My old man's got a 14 hour day
(?) nothin' to the rest of us
Say something unkind before you give it away
Hey, where'd you get that black eye, tell me?
NC-17, and counting
I couldn't tell if I was playin' around
The kids always talkin' 'bout nothin' at all
Their daddies always sayin' that the kids are goin' crazy
But how far could you get with that broken leg?
...What's it worth to you anyway?
Cause uh, NC-17 and counting
But I couldn't tell you if you twisted my arm
(GET UP....)
He lost the soles of his shoes in the 23rd lap
And Jenny says he's (?) gonna get 'em back on
And I couldn't pay them with a personal check
...And it's like, NC-17 and counting
'n I'm tryin' 'a figure out what's goin' on
Well, it goes like... 
How can we be sure that this will never happen again? (repeat 8x)---Lyrics submitted by Fallon Kirwan.
