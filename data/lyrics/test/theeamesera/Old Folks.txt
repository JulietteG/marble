That's how the old folks used to do
That's how the old folks used to do
Killing spare time with a hook and a capital K
But should you have it your way

That's how the old folks used to do
That's how the old folks used to do
That's how the old folks used to do
That's how the old folks used to do
Killing spare time with a hook and a capital K
But you could have it your way

When I met you father he said girl you're a lush
You better keep you nose clean, better keep in touch
That is he said to me all the things we do
Remind him of when he was younger than us

But if you just grow up we would be so proud of you
Why don't you get a real job and cut your hair too
Trade in that nasty shirt for a three quarter
Blouse and iron it twice a day

He said
That's how the old folks used to do
That's how the old folks used to do
Killing spare time with a hook and a capital K
But should you have it your way---Lyrics submitted by Fallon Kirwan.
