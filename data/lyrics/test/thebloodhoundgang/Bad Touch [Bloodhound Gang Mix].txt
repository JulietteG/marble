Sweat, baby. Sweat, baby-
sex is a Texas Drought.
Me and you do the kind of stuff
that only Prince would sing about.
So, put your hands 
down my pants-
and I bet you'll feel nuts.
Yes I'm Siskel, yes I'm Ebert,
and your getting two thumbs up.
You've had enough of two-hand touch,
you want it rough,
your out of bounds.
I want you smothered-
want you covered
like my Waffle House hasbrowns.
Come quicker than Fedex,
never reach an apex,
just like Coca-Cola stocks.
You are inclined to make me rise
an hour early,
just like Daylight Savings Time.

[Chorus]
(Do it now)
You and me baby 
ain't nothin' but mammals. 
So lets do it like they do on the
Discovery Channel.
(Do it again now)
You and me baby 
ain't nothin' but mammals. 
So lets do it like the do on the 
Discovery Channel.
(Gettin' horny now)

Love-
the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket.
Like the lost catacombs of Eygpt, 
only God knows where we stuck it.
Hierogylphics?
Let me be Pacific,
I wanna be down in your South Seas.
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean
means
"Small Craft Advisory"
So if I capsize on your thighs-
high tide-
B-5- you sunk my battleship.
Please turn me on
I'm Mister Coffee
with an automatic drip.
So show me yours, I'll show you mine.
"Tool Time"
You'll Lovett just like Lyle,
and then we'll do it doggy style, 
so we can both watch "X-Files"

[Chorus] x 1

You and me baby
ain't nothin' but mammals 
so lets do it like they do on the 
Discovery Channel.
(Do it again now)
You and me baby
ain't nothin' but mammals
so lets do it like they do on the 
Dicovery Channel.
(Do it now)
You and me baby
ain't nothin but mammals 
so lets do it like they do on the 
Discovery Channel. 
(DO IT AGAIN NOW)
You and me baby 
aint nothin but mammals 
so lets do it like they do on the 
Discovery Channel
