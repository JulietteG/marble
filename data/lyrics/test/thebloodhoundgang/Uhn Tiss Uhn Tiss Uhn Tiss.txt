Dog will hunt I'm the front end loader Travoltin' over so try my slam on for size
Drive stick with that kung-fu grip let the banana split and watch it go right to your thighs
Cop a feel Copperfield style Abracadabra that bra do you think I can pull it off?
Wanna bang around? Just jot me down on your to-do list under "put out like a fire" 'cause

I got somethin' and it goes thumpin' like this
All you need is my uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
I got somethin' and it goes thumpin' like this
All you need is my uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss

Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby

Edible strange how do I get in your pants when you're tick tockin' them
Serious Levis? So tight can't be classified that's why I'm here to fill that opening
Make a seasoned pass to mount that ass and Bob Hope that i might one night stand a chance
Let's go feng shui the fuck around my digs like a superball bring that sunny side up and

I got somethin' and it goes thumpin' like this
All you need is my uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
I got somethin' and it goes thumpin' like this
All you need is my uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss

Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby

Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss

I got somethin' and it goes thumpin' like this
All you need is my uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
I got somethin' and it goes thumpin' like this
All you need is my uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss

Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby

Uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss baby uhn tiss uhn tiss uhn tiss
