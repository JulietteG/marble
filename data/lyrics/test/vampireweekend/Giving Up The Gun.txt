Your swords grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
Its locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things its done

And though its been a long time
Youre right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now youre giving up the gun

When I was 17
I had wrists like steel
And I felt complete

And now my body fades
Behind a brass charade
And Im obsolete

But if the chance remained
To see those better days
Id cut the cannons down

My ears are blown to bits
From all the rifle hits
But I still crave that sound

Your swords grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
Its locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things its done

And though its been a long time
Youre right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now youre giving up the gun

I heard you play guitar
Down at a seedy bar
Where skinheads used to fight

Your Tokugawa smile
And your garbage style
Used to save the night

You felt the coming wave
Told me wed all be brave
You said you wouldnt flinch

But in the years that passed
Since I saw you last
You havent moved an inch

Your swords grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
Its locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things its done

And though its been a long time
Youre right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now youre giving up the gun

I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on

I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on

I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on

I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on

I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on

I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on

Your swords grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
Its locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things its done

And though its been a long time
Youre right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now youre giving up the gun---Lyrics submitted by Henri.
