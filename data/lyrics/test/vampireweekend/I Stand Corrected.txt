You've been checking on my facts
And I admit I have been lax
In double-screening what I say
It wasn't funny anyway

I stand corrected

No one cares when you are wrong
But I've been at this far too long
To act like that when we should be
In perfect harmony

I stand corrected

Lord knows I haven't tried
I'll take my stand
One last time

Forget the protocol
I'll take your hand
Right in mine---Lyrics submitted by Akela.
