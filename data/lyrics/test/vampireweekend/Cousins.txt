Y! AY! AY! AY! AY! AY!

You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door.
You and this model sit outside the side-
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on the night.

Dad was a risk taker.
His was a shoe maker.
You greatest hits 2006,
Little list maker.

Caught in the melody,
You wait in the car.
You were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all.

Interest in colors
I discover myself
If your art life is gritty you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls
When your birth right is interest you could just accrue it all

Me and my cousins,
And You and your cousins
It's a line that is always running.
Me and my cousins,
You and your cousins,
I can feel it coming---Lyrics submitted by symone.
