one night to be confused
one night to speed up truth
we had a promise made
four hands and then away

both under influense
we had demons in 
to know what to say
mind is a razorblade

to call for hands of above
to lean on
wouldn't be good enough
for me, no

one night of magic rush
the start of simple touch
one night to push and scream
and make believes.

ten days of perfect tunes
the colors red and blue
we had a promise made
we were in love

to call for hands of above
to lean on
wouldn't be good enough
for me, no

to call for hands of above
to lean on
wouldn't be good enough
for me, no

and you, you knew you had to fight devil
and you, kept us away with wolf teeths
sharing different heartbeats
in one night

to call for hands of above
to lean on
wouldn't be good enough
for me, no

to call for hands of above
to lean on
wouldn't be good enough
for me, no---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
