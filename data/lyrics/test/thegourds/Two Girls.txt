The clouds they looked like cotton, they didn't even look like clouds
I was underneath the weather, my friends looked like a crowd
The swimming hole was full of rum, I tried to find out why
All I learned was this my friends: you got to swim before you fly

Chorus:
I got two girls, one's in heaven one's below
One I love with all my heart and one I do not know

Two lonesome dudes on an ugly horse came by not long ago
They asked me where the action was I said I did not know
As they disappeared into the brush, I heard the driver say
He's a little slow between the ears, he's always been that way

Chorus:
I got two girls, one's in heaven one's below
One I love with all my heart and one I do not know

Tall Jane just lays around and listens with her mouth
She's had about a dozen husbands and the last one just pulled out
And who will bring her dinner, in the weary years ahead
All she gets from me is sympathy 
I've got no time to see she's fed

Chorus:
I got two girls, one's in heaven one's below
One I love with all my heart and one I do not know

It's cold down the bayou, they say it's in your mind
The moccasins are treading ice, and leaving strange designs
The cajuns say the last time - it happened they weren't here
Aww Beaumont's full of penguins
And I'm a playing it by ear

Chorus:
I got two girls, one's in heaven one's below
One I love with all my heart and one I do not know

repeat:
I got two girls, one's in heaven one's below
One I love with all my heart and one I do not know---Lyrics submitted by dave anderson.
