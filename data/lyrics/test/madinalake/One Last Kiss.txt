She looked at me her eyes were watering 
Then I knew that this was about to end 
Frozen in that moment, time was standing still 
I could feel my heart sinking,fragile 

Goodbye, she said theres some in this world for you, 
So good luck, she said i went and found somebody new 

And I gave you every waking moment 
I gave you everything you wanted 
And now, My love, you're giving me up 

She walked away and I could hardly breath 
Turn around and fell down to my knees 
I'm shivering as the truth is settling 
Her tomorrow is nothing to do with me 

So before, you go 
Could you just leave me one more kiss? 

And I gave you every waking moment 
I gave you everything you wanted 
And now, My love, you're giving me up 

And I, can't lie still 
When there's someone else beside you 
And I, can't lie still 
'cause I'm all alone this time 

I gave you everything you wanted 
And now, I know you're giving me up 

I remember when you were falling 
And I was there just holding onto you 
And I remember all those 
Scars I wear that you carved in me 

And I gave you every waking moment 
I gave you everything you wanted 
And now, I know you're giving me up 

And I, can't lie still 
When there's someone else beside you 
And I, can't lie still 
'cause I'm all alone this time 

I gave you everything you wanted 
And now, I know you're giving me up---Lyrics submitted by Leah.
