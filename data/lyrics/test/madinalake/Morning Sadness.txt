I,ve cut my eye's on vision's of you.
Memories of glee.
I lost toch with the boy i knew, while you were still here.
Have you met your God?
does he know I'm in pain?
Does he have eny plans..... for me to see you agen?
Morning sadness here we meet agen.
Pack you're bag's because we are leaving tonight.
Damage done by a lost love'd one.
You can't ever forget.
questioning my fait in God? 
i know evil exists.
I look past the sky, thats were we are going tonigh.---Lyrics submitted by kieran.
