I watch the sun fall down to kill the day,
Another part of me just went up in flames
'Cause I'm bored and dumb and dying to change
It's the simple life driving me insane.

Then you explode in my head,
And now you're all over me.
I come alive with you.
You know you set me free.
Let's go!

Let's burn this town
Right to the ground
And we'll go down like every legend before us.
We'll part the seas,
Make history,
While chasing dreams like every legend before us.

You and me, we hit the streets
'Cause the thrill of living gives me energy.
I wanna steal a car and rob a bank.
I wanna find a cure that'll save the world.
'Cause our lives are going up in flames
As we watch like it's a movie.
I come alive with you.
You're like the drug inside of my head!

Let's burn this town
Right to the ground
And we'll go down like every legend before us.
We'll part the seas,
Make history,
While chasing dreams like every legend before us.

I open up like a window for you,
So come on in and destroy me like you do.
You come on in after midnight for me,
And drag me out while the city falls asleep.

Martyrs and kings,
Heroes and thieves,
We're chasing dreams like every legend before us.

Let's burn this town
Right to the ground
And we'll go down like every legend before us.
We'll part the seas,
Make history,
While chasing dreams like every legend before us.

Let's burn this town
Right to the ground
And we'll go down like every legend before us.
Liars and kings,
Heroes and thieves,
We're chasing dreams like every legend before us.---Lyrics submitted by Khush.
