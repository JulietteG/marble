Shes got big brown eyes and tangled hair
Voguing in her underwear
And nothing is better than doing nothing together now
Shes got a toothbrush as a microphone
Belting out the Rolling Stones
Im the last one to stop her
Cant believe that I got her

We get so close, kissing like Eskimos
Its a little bit much
I know, I do

Isnt she cra-crazy beautiful
Isnt she stra-strange and wonderful
And I think I love her more than I even understand

Shes got a classic style thats all her own
Smile you can hear through the telephone
She says shes a rebel, but shes way too sentimental
Shes precious even when shes mad
Gets angry and I start to laugh
And I know that its nothing
Shes just pushing my buttons

We get so close, kissing like Eskimos
Its a little bit much
I know, I do

Isnt she cra-crazy beautiful
Isnt she stra-strange and wonderful
And I think I love her more than I even understand (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh)

Shes a little bit wild, a little bit mad, a little bit uh oh, beautiful
Wild, a little bit bad, a little bit uh oh
And I never could know her too well
Oh, still I never want anyone else

Isnt she cra-crazy beautiful
Isnt she stra-strange and wonderful
And I think I love her more than I even understand

Shes a little bit wild, a little bit mad, a little bit uh oh, beautiful
Wild, a little bit bad, a little bit uh oh
And I think I love her more than I even understand---
