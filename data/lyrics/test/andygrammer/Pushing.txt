Ive been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life, Ive been pushing all my life
Ive been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life, Ive been pushing all my life
For some want to see right through all the false alarms I pulled
Some want to stand their ground when I start to tear them down
Someone to to outlast the hold ups that hold me back
For someone to make it past, the guards of a cynical heart
Sick of singing now
Oh, I always jump ship
And we are closer than Ive ever been
I say we stand in the fire and hope we can burn our way out
The road to my heart gets hot as hell
Ive been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life, Ive been pushing all my life
Ive been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life, Ive been pushing all my life
For some want to call me out when I start to run my mouth
Some want to talk down from ledges that I have found
Someone to hold me close when Im screaming to let go
Someone to make it past the guards of a cynical heart
Sick of singing now
Oh, I always jump ship
And we are closer than Ive ever been
I say we stand in the fire and hope we can burn our way out
The road to my heart gets hot as hell
Ive been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life, Ive been pushing all my life
Ive been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life, Ive been pushing all my life
I know that its not fair to think that youd still be there
I know that its not fair
(pushing all my life, all my life)
But if you leave with a pattern of beats
Im pushing you away but its not what I mean
Oh Im ashamed and cannot believe that this is what takes just to get close to me
Is this what it takes just to get close to me
Is this what it takes just to get close to me
Oh
Oh, I always jump ship
And we are closer than Ive ever been
Oh
Oh, I always jump ship
And we are closer than Ive ever been
I say we stand in the fire and hope we can burn our way out
The road to my heart gets hot as hell
Ive been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life, Ive been pushing all my life
Ive been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life, Ive been pushing all my life---
