(Verse 1)
I wake up and I'm sober
Don't even know you anymore
Punch drunk on a feeling
Lost in believing, I was sure
I don't care what you have to say

Damn words get in the way
I don't want to know
I know there will come a time
When I look you in the eyes and say I told you so

(chorus)
And I promise you this you're going to miss me, miss me
As long as you live you're going to miss me, miss me

(Verse 2)
Set me up for the falling
Gave me no warning you were gone
Let me down I was reeling
I can't believe what you've done
Go do what you got to do

Damn words will follow you everywhere you go
And I know there will come a time
When I look you in the eyes and say I told you so

(chorus)

(Bridge)
I believe in my heart, when something is wrong
Say it's wrong
I can deal with the part where something is wrong
If we both stay strong

I know there will come a time
When I look you in the eyes and say I told you so

(chorus)

I wake up and I'm sober---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
