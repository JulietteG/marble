I'm gonna need you to raise your glass 
I don't care what you put in it 
Here's to nights that you can't take back 
We live hard but we love to laugh 

We all thought that we'd get rich fast 
Hop the plane out for greener grass 
Found out the green is cash 
Don't compare to the friends that last 

See, we won't forget where we came from 
The city won't change us 
We beat to the same drum 
No, we won't forget where we came from 
The city can't change us 
We beat to the same drum, the same drum 

(Hey!) 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe 
(Hey!) 
And no matter where we go 
We always find our way back home 

(Hey!) 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe 
(Hey!) 
And no matter where we go 
We always find our way back home

So here's to the cheap sunglasses 
Redbull and minivans and 
People who had your back when 
The world didn't understand 

See, we won't forget where we came from 
The city won't change us 
We beat to the same drum 
No, we won't forget where we came from 
The city can't change us 
We beat to the same drum, the same drum 

(Hey!) 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe 
(Hey!) 
And no matter where we go 
We always find our way back home 

(Hey!) 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe 
(Hey!) 
And no matter where we go 
We always find our way back home

When ties loosen 
We're losin' touch 
And fading away 
We'll still be raising our cups 
To the same damn things 

Oh no, the city won't change us
Oh no, the city won't change us
Oh no, the city won't change us
Oh no, the city won't change us
Won't change us (Hey!) 

La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe 
And no matter where we go 
We always find our way back home 

La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe 
And no matter where we go 
We always find our way back home

La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah 
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-doe 
And no matter where we go 
We always find our way back home

(Hey!) 
We always find our way back home 
Yeah, we always find our way back home ---
