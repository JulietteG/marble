Not so long ago, I knew how to laugh
You taught me how to love
and how to dance
When things went wrong,
you always had a song
That always seemed to make things right

It was the sound of you and I
The sound of you and I

Maybe someday soon I'll become a man
Put off childish things
and take your hand
With yours in mine,
I think I'll be alright
I think I'll make it through the night

When I hear the sound of you and I
The sound of you and I

When you're away, you think it'd be okay
To sing this song just one more time?

I love the sound of you and I
The sound of you and I

The sound of you and I,
The sound of you and I
I love the sound of you and I---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
