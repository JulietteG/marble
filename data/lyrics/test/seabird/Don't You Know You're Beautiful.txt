Don't you remember
You were happier when you were younger
Things were so simple yeah
'Til the day he walked out on your mother But now you blame yourself Because you're by yourself You feel like it's not gonna change You're crying on the floor cause you can take no more Looking for a way to escape

And all this time saying you were fine
And everyone still to blame
Well there you are
You and your broken heart
It's written all over your face

Don't you know
Don't you know that you're beautiful yeah Don't you know Don't you know that you're beautiful

I see you laughing
But I know inside that you're crying
Just tell me what happened when things went wrong We'll try to make sense of it all Please don't blame yourself Cause you're not by yourself I've been right here all along Don't have to be alone Because you've always know Wherever your heart is my home

And all this time
Saying you were fine
And everyone still to blame
Well there you are
You and your broken heart
It's written all over your face

Don't you know
Don't you know that you're beautiful yeah Don't you know Don't you know that you're beautiful

Can't you see what you mean to me
Can't you see what you mean to me---Lyrics submitted by jordan.
