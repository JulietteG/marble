Me and my baby on a February holiday
'Cause we got the news
Yeah, we got the news
Five hundred miles and we're gonna make it all the way
Got nothing to lose
We got nothing to lose

Been 10 years waiting but it's better late than never
We've been told before
I can't wait one minute more

Oh, me and my baby driving down
To a hilly seaside town in the rainfall
Oh, me and my baby stand in line
You've never seen a sight so fine
As the love that's gonna shine
At city hall

Me and my baby have been through a lot of good and bad
Learned to kiss the sky, made our mamas cry
Seen a lot of friends, after giving it all they had, lay down and die
Lay down and die

Ten years into it, here's our window
At the Vegas drive-thru chapel
It ain't too much for 'em all to handle

Oh, me and my baby driving down
To a hilly seaside town in the rainfall
Oh, me and my baby stand in line
You've never seen a sight so fine
As the love that's gonna shine
At city hall

Outside, they're handing out donuts and pizza pies
For the folks in pairs in their folding chairs
My baby's looking so damned pretty with those anxious eyes
Rain-speckled hair, and my ring to wear

Ten years waiting for this moment of fate
When we say the words and sign our names
If they take it away again someday
This beautiful thing won't change

Oh, me and my baby driving down
To a hilly seaside town in the rainfall
Oh, me and my baby stand in line
You've never seen a sight so fine
As the love that's gonna shine
At city hall---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
