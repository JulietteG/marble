While you were building you empires
I was still sleeping
I was still sleeping

And while you were setting your woods afire
I was still dreaming
I was still dreaming

Now I will unsettle the ground beneath you
Send my waters ashore
Creep into your bed
Find you in every corner

While you argue it over
I am not waiting
I am not waiting

And while you retreat to your comforts
I am not fading
I am not fading

I've done this many times before you
Old Shanghai, New Orleans
Amsterdam and Mumbai

Strange new creatures to scavenge your pores, oh
I've done this many times before you
Ashen sky, lightning storms
Deltas to desert plains
Wartime on every border

I've done this many times before you
Watch the pattern take form
Children, your time is done 
If you say it's done
Together---Lyrics submitted by K G.
