Hey love
Is that the name you're meant to have
For me to call?
Look love
They've given up believing
They've turned aside our stories of the gentle fall

But don't you believe them
Don't you drink their poison too
These are the scars that words have carved
On me

Hey love
That's the name we've long held back
From the core of truth

So don't turn away now
I am turning in revolution
These are scars that silence carved
On me

This is the same place
No, not the same placle
This is the same place, love
No, not the same place we've been before

Hey love
I am a constant satellite
Of your blazing sun
My love
I obey your law of gravity

This is the fate you've carved on me
The law of gravity
This is the fate you've carved on me---Lyrics submitted by Delia.
