he's a company man, your right hand
thirteen years and counting
no detectable ambitions
a model of efficiency, far as you can see
he knows every loophole
the art of fine print
massages the numbers till they fit
and every time you ask him for another vanishing act
he half-smiles, as if to say:

whatever you want
whatever you want
whatever you want is fine by me

never a real moment together but she understands
you're an important man
another late night
not sure if you're coming home or when
she's alone again
but she goes on curating your domestic museum
she disappears in her loyalty
she is a dress
wearing a face
in the doorway
opening her arms out to you

whatever you want
whatever you want
whatever you want is fine by me

no one dares to question you
no one would dare to stand up
but in the night she leaves the papers in a tidy pile
evidence for her reasons
and in the night he takes the main accounts
and pulls the files
detailing every treason
I am the last one you'd ever suspect
of setting the fire
but as you switch on your t.v. tomorrow morning
you'll hear me saying quietly:

whatever you want
whatever you want
whatever you want is fine by me

whatever you say
whatever you say
I'll do what you ask me
I'll do what you ask me

whatever you say
whatever you say
but do you know who's listening?

whatever you say
whatever you say
you know it's over---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
