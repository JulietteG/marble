Blue, blue caravan
Winding down to the valley of lights
My true love is a man
Who would hold me for ten thousand nights

In the wild, wild wailing wind
He's a house 'neath a soft yellow moon
So blue, blue caravan
Won't you carry me down to him soon?

Blue, blue caravan
Won't you drive away all of these tears?
For my true love is a man
That I haven't seen in years

He said, "Go where you have to
For I belong to you until my dying day"
So like a fool, blue caravan, I believed him
And I walked away

Oh, my blue, blue caravan
Oh, the highway is my great wall
For my true love is man
Who never existed at all

Oh, he was a beautiful fiction
I invented to keep out the cold
But now my blue, blue caravan
I can feel my heart growing old---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
