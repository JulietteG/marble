Sunday: dark water draining north
the heat swells and bursts like plague
Sunday: ever-so-faint slow tambourine
glides onward toward the grave

who drew the line?
who drew the line between you and me?
who drew the line that everyone sees?

darling, lake Pontchartrain is haunted:
bones without names
photographs framed in reeds
darling, what blood our veins was holding
the overpass frozen
fires ablaze at sea

who drew the line?
who drew the line that cuts to the skin, buries me in?
tell me who drew the line
darling, don't close your eyes

(lie as darkness hardens
lie of our reunion
o lie if God is sleeping
o I believe you now)

darling, lake Pontchartrain will cradle me
and all you left behind
listen: ever-so-faint slow motion tambourine
is marching back through time---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
