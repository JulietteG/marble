Pretty soon I've got to go
the soon I leave
the sooner I can come home
Do you still feel me?
Don't disconnect
Don't disconnect yet
Don't disconnect yet
Go ahead and just ask me all of the questions
Left in your head
don't disconnect
Don't disconnect yet
Don't disconnect yet
Don't disconnect yet
Do you still feel me?
Do you still feel me?
Do you still feel me?
Pretty soon I've got to go
the soon I leave
the sooner I can come home
Do you still feel me?
Don't disconnect
Don't disconnect yet
Do you still feel me?
Do you still feel me?
Don't disconnect
Do you still feel me?
Don't disconnect
Don't disconnect yet
Don't disconnect
Don't disconnect yet
Don't disconnect yet---
