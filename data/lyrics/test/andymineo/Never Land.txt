[Bridge: Marz]
Looking in the distance
I'm dreaming of a world for us
When the moons align
We'll map out a journey for you and I
For you and I
For you and I

[Hook: Marz]
In the night, I'm alone
Without you, I'm drifting off
When you, take my hand
I'm so high up I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Aye, look
Everybody wanna be on top
I don't think they know what that means
Once you get there you can't stop
Everybody gunnin for ya spot
Aiming at ya team, I'm up all night, chasing dreams
Everything change when ya go from seeing it all
Big screen to behind the scenes
Leading us on like this the life they lead
You know the rich and famous, kill theyself to stay rich and famous
Very same thing they they built they name with
Be the same thing they they be enslaved with
So, I don't want rap you can have that
I don't want the crown yo I'm aiming past that
Heading for another thrown can't have that
It's a Kingdom where my Dads at
And I'm his son I sing ? and
I'm in some so death won't have that last laugh
Huh, child of a King, royalty
That's ascap
They want glory, money, and power before you go
I promise you it's empty we aiming just way too low
I know we own things we don't need to impress people we don't know
Then we go broke trying to look rich
I can't do it, I just won't
My new goal is to be close to the one that made my soul man
Them other highs will gon' let you down
I'm trying to get so high I'll Never Land

[Hook]
In the night, I'm alone
Without you, I'm drifting off
When you, take my hand
I'm so high up I'll never land
Up, up, up, up, up
I'll never land

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
I am Rubio with the red jeans
Uhh, Cuomo with the 16's
In the studio, Michelangelo with a microphone writing sistines
But these songs aim for the chapel---
