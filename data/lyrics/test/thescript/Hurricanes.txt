Neither one of us is getting out of here alive
both of us are stranded and we won't make it back inside
the whole world is blowing away we just watch it pass us by 
yeah, swept us of our feet when we meet in the northern sky

Like thunder and lightning go in the one
Together we make a perfect storm
You're like the wind I'm like the rain
Together we both make hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes

We're heading towards each other at 150 miles an hour
Knocking us of course with the forces once you feel the power
Where tryna get away tryna clear the path
From everything we buried in the aftermath
Swear like a super sale legging getting lager and lager

Like thunder and lightning go in the one
Together we make a perfect storm
You're like the wind I'm like the rain
Together we both make hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes

On my own I'm just another cold rainy day
Before the winter gone along and take me away
But she's just a breeze on a sunny day
But once the two of us together
Man were blown away

Like thunder and lightning go in the one
Together we make a perfect storm
You're like the wind I'm like the rain
Together we both make hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
