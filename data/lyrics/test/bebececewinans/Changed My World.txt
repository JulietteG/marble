Heaven knows Ive done wrong; mercy helped me see Ive been living a lie.
And while writing this song, thinking bout Your goodness I started to cry.
Yes, oh oh oh grace; what would I do without grace (do without grace)

Hide behind a painted smile; you lash out and sing while youre spiritually down, yeah
Theres no need to sit in denial; He knows all about it and understands why (yes He does)
Oh oh oh grace (oh grace oh grace); what would I do without grace
Oh oh oh grace; where would I be, where would I be without grace

How can you love me still when Ive done wrong (grace)
And how can I make it through this angry storm (oh grace)
Say oh oh oh grace; what would I do without Your grace
Oh oh oh grace; where would I be without grace (where would I be without grace)

What can make me whole in my soul (grace grace)
What can wash my sin (grace)
Say grace; what would I do without Your grace (couldnt make it)

Tell you what lately Ive learned; He picks me up whenever Im down
(Have you ever been down? Ive been down.)
Nothin Ive done or can do can take away this love, this love that Ive found

Oh oh oh grace (grace); what would I do, what would I do without grace
Oh oh oh grace; where would I be without grace

Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now Im found, I was blind but now I see

Thats why we say amazing; thats why we sing amazing grace (I cant move without it)
I cant live without Your grace; thank You for Your grace---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
