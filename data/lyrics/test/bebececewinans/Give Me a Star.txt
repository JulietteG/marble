I've walked many nights without a place to rest,
Not knowing whether home was north, south, east or west
But give me one star, Just one simple light
And I'll never walk alone again at night.

Many times it seemed that I would never find my way
Lose sight on being free in bondage  I would stay
But give me one star, Just one simple light
And I'll never walk alone again at night.

Chorus -
So Give me a star 
(Give me one star to clear the mist and fog away)
Give me A Star 
(Give me one star to light the world in dark today)
One simple Light 
(Give me a star, just one simple light and I'll Never walk alone
again at night)
Bridge-
Oh I see a new star rising in the sky ( Oooh)
A Star of joy, A star to purify
A Star of Days old ( Days of Old)
A Star of Days..( Days Of Old)
And a Star( And a Star thats filled with love)
The Star of Rain and Storm

Strong Winds are beating me with Stormy Winds and Rain
My Arms are Hurting from the weight of heavy chains
But give me one star, Just one simple light
And I'll never walk alone again at night.

 - Chorus - x2
 Give me a star
(Give me one star to clear the mist and fog away)
All I want is  A Star
(Give me one star to light the world in dark today)
Just One simple Light
(Give me a star, just one simple light and I'll Never walk alone
again at night)

on 2nd repeat - and I'll never walk alone
I'll never walk alone
I'll never walk alone again at night

Chorus x3 (+ adlib)

All I need is a star , want is a star to drive the mist and fog away

All I need is a star want is a star to light the world in dark today

All I need is a star one little star, give me a star one simple star
