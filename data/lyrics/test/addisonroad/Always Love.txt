To make a mountain of your life is just a choice
but I never learned enough to listen to the voice that told me
always love
hate will get you every time
always love
don't wait 'til the finish line

Slow demands come 'round
squeeze the air and keep the rest out
it helps to write it down
even when you then cross it out

but always love
hate will get you everytime
always love
even when you want to fight

self directed lives
i want to know what it'd be like
to aim so high above
any card that you get dealt

you always love
hate will get you every time
always love
hate will get you
i've been held back by something, yeah
you said to me quietly on the stairs
i've been held back by something. yeah
you said to me quietly on the stairs
you said
hey you good ones
hey you good ones
hey you good ones

to make a mountain of your life is just a choice
but i never learned enough to listen to the voice that told me
always love
always love
hate will get you everytime
always love
hate will get you
i've been held back by something, yeah
you said to me quietly on the stairs
i've been held back by something, yeah
you said to me quietly on the stairs
you said
hey you good ones
hey you good ones
hey you good ones
