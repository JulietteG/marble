A one, two, one two four

Jeux sans frontieres (4X)

Hans plays with Lotte, Lotte plays with Jane
Jane plays with Willi, Willi is happy again
Suki plays with Leo, Sacha plays with Britt
Adolf builts a bonfire, Enrico plays with it

Whistling tunes we hide in the dunes by the seaside
Whistling tunes we`re kissing baboons in the jungle

It`s a knockout
If looks could kill, they probably will
In games without frontiers, war without tears
If looks could kill, they probably will
In games without frontiers, war without tears
Games without frontiers, war without tears

Jeux sans frontieres (3X)

Andre has a red flag, Chiang Ching`s is blue
They all have hills to fly them on except for Lin Tai Yu
Dressing up in costumes, playing silly games
Hiding out in tree-tops shouting out rude names

Whistling tunes we hide in the dunes by the seaside
Whistling tunes we piss on the goons in the jungle

It`s a knockout
If looks could kill they probably will
In games without frontiers, war without tears
If looks could kill they probably will
In games without frontiers, war without tears
Games without frontiers, war without tears

Jeux sans frontieres (repeat to fade---Lyrics submitted by Francis.
