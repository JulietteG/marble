It's a psychobilly freakout!

Well, we're off, we're off, we're off!
It's, it's, it's a psychobilly freakout!

Well, we're off, we're off, we're off!
I'll tell you what it is! (what is it God dang it!?)
It's some kinda Texas psychobilly freakout that's what it is!

Well, we're off, we're off, we're off!
It's a psychobilly freakout!---Lyrics submitted by Garrett William.
