I am sinking in the river that is raging
I am drowning
Will I ever, rise to breathe again
I wanna know why
I just wanna understand
Will I ever know why?
How could this be from Your hand?

/Chorus/
When every little thing that I have dreamed would be just slips away like water through my hands
And when it seems the walls of my beliefs are crashing down like theyre all made of sand
I wont, let go of You now
because I know, oh, Youre not shaken

I am trembling in the darkness of my own fear
All the questions with no answers
So grip me while Im here
And I may never know why
Oh I may not understand
But I will lift up my eyes,
and trust this is Your plan

/Chorus/

When I am in the valley
of the shadow of death

Youre not shaken
Youre not shaken

You're right here beside me and 
You have never left

You're not shaken
You're not shaken
