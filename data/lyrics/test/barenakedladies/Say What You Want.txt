Say what you want
'Cause I can't hear you anyway
Go where you will
I won't steer you or lead you either way

Did you just fail to mention
That maybe I can make you smile again?
Make you smile and after a while, say
Did I just get your attention?
Did you notice that I changed my style and then
Made me smile, but it's not my style

Still say what you want
'Cause I can't hear you anyway
Go where you will
I won't steer you or lead you either way

Did you lose your medication
Or did you just want to be with me again?
I'll set you free, now let me be
This has been an education
Every bit of its reminding me of them
Reminding me there is no "we"

Now say what you want
'Cause I can't hear you anyway
Go where you will
I won't steer you or lead you either way

I've been running through the timelines
Picturing the headlines, but from memory
You weren't even in the room then
Is it safe to just assume then
You won't make an ass of me, well

Say what you want
'Cause I can't hear you anyway
Go where you will
I won't steer you or lead you either way (I won't lead you either way)
(I won't lead you either way)
I won't steer you or lead you either way (I won't lead you either way)---
