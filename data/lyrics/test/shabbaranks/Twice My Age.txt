I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age, 
Don't know what it is, but its a hit from me youthful days, 
As I go my way, I don't care what people say, 
I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age! 

Come now! igle jube, jube - igle jube 
She nuh waan no igle jube, jube... igle jube, 
She want a man wi nuff load of de royalty 
De igle jube, yuh know say 'im nuh've money 
She nuh waan no lover's honey, she waan di money, 
She nuh waan no lover's honey, she waan di money! 

When I tell you girls, in my youthful days, 
I never loved another man my age, and then the don, he came along 
He made me smile all the while, and he stood tall and strong, so strong, so strong... 

Young man have strength but that is not sense, 
She want a man fi let have recumpense, 
True! She wah pay lightbill and rent, and 
You know you haffi have a big dividend and 
Dung di line you pocket haffi have length 
Mek suh say dat de man 'ave batty fulla strength 

stood up for me when no one cared. 
stood up for me where other men wouldn't dare 
made me know when true man love 
never made me feel he's old 
never gave me love that cold 
you had better watch your food 
old men will dip into your plate 

Now as 'oman have old man nuh a go find that she wrong 
Now she a deal wid a foundation 
de live de young man all a go mash up her plan 
an' she wan some dollas in her hand 

I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age, 
Don't know what it is, but its a hit from me youthful days, 
As I go my way, I don't care what people say, 
I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age! 

She nuh waan no igle jube, jube... igle jube, 
She nuh waan no igle jube, jube... igle jube, 
She nuh waan no lover's honey, all she want is money, 
She nuh waan no lover's honey, all she want is money, 
De 'oman is dealin wi maturity 
Tha's why she nah goin tek one unda 30 
35 an 40, 45 an 60 
65 an 60 de woman waan money 

Girls, this is my advice to you! 
A man that age has good experience! 
He'll treat you good, he'll treat you well, 
he may make you rich and proud, 
so you won't have to bow, won't have to bow! 

Young man have strength but that is not sense, 
She want a man fi let have recumpense, 
True! She waan pay lightbill and rent, and 
Mek sure say you pocket dey have length, and 
Your collar ?? ha fe full up a strength 
Igle jube, jube... igle jube, 
She nuh waan no lover's honey, all she want is money, 
She nuh waan no lover's honey, all she want is money, 

I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age, 
I don't know what it is, but its a hit from me youthful days, 
As I go my way, I don't care what people say, 
I'm in love with a man, nearly twice my age!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
