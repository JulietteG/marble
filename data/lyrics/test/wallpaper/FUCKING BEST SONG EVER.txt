Fill in the blanks without spilling your drinks:
 My name is _____ and I'm a alcoholic
 Not for real, but what else do you call this
 Find me in the clubby
 Going duper dumby
 Borrowing your money mo- money

In the bathroom flask full of iced tea-tea
 College grad chicks straddling me-me
 I think that she want me 
To get up in her tummy
 That's why they call me "Gutsy"
 and I be like "Check My Spanish"

Mamacita, te necesito
 Soy ebrio, that's all the words I know
 I shoot tequila from Costa Rica
 I gotta tell ya-I gotta tell ya

Best friends, you are my fucking best friends
 Seriously, it's like the best night ever
 This song, I'm really feeling this song
 This song, fucking best song ever,
Ever,everrr....

It's only midnight, chicks like "Heels off!" "ogh"
 Barefooted on the floor playing leapfrog
 Skittles don't leave no juice 
and rolypoly produce
 That's why they call me "Whoa, dude"
 "Slow, slow dude" "Your roll dude"

Mamacita, te necesito
 Soy ebrio, that's all the words I know
 Margaritas and microwave pizzas
 I gotta tell ya-I really gotta tell ya

Best friends, you are my fucking best friends
 Seriously, it's like the best night ever
 This song, I'm really feelin this song
 This song, fucking best song ever
Ever-Everrr

Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay 

Ayooooooo-Ayooooooo-Ayooooooo-Ayooooooo

Check My Spanish

Best friends, you are my fucking best friends
 Seriously, it's like the best night ever
 This song, I'm really feeling this song
 This song, fucking best song ever,
Ever,

Best friends, you are my fucking best friends
 Seriously, it's like the best night ever
 This song, I'm really feeling this song
 This song, fucking best song ever,
Ever,

Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
