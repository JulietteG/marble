That's all you got?x3

I don't put glue sticks in my nose and um
But my face pasted to linoleum
Kitchen floor shit
Some college dorm shit

Face down in a bloodstained carpet
Get chicks at the farmers' market
White girls buy produce
Take 'em home make 'em drink Grey Goose

Whiteboy wasted
Glue stick pasted
Whiteboy wasted
Glue stick pasted
Stupidfacedd x3

I drink a can of Sparks and try to freestyle
Ex-girlfriends on speed dial
Oh that's a drunk dial drunk sexting
Drunk stagger drunk swagger

I don't rap good it don't matter
Can't sing good. it don't matter
Cause I'm whacked-out sleepwalking
On a quest for God at my friend's apartment

Whiteboy wasted
Glue stick pasted
Whiteboy wasted
Glue stick pasted
Stupidfacedd x3

When I say "awkward" y'all say "silence"
Awkward
Awkward

Super Soaker filled with Four Loko
Plus SoCo real gross yo
I go ham and cheese on rolls
That's a metaphor. Another metaphor:

Like icing on a Cinnabon
Like a hot chick that ain't no fun
Listen I'ma teach you a lesson
Let's start at number

One: Sleep is the best way to save money
Two: Money is the best way to have sex
Three: Sex is the best way to feel nothing
Four: Nothing happens if you're asleep

So stay up until you wake up
