Hey Hey.

[Sean Garrett]
Shawty just fly, gotta thang on her.
Damn she really got me wanna fill her cup
Straight from the islands, blue water, black sand
Only English that mama can talk is "me like kissy kiss" (Kissy Kiss)
Dominican with a French accent
Shakin that green infront me, (damn) so quick
Standin on the table, slow windin wit a bottle,
saying kinky things in french and you know what she means.

[Chorus - Pharrell]
She smilin in my face, with her breath smellin like patron,
 so whats wrong
(What she doin, tell me what she doin P. Im knowin just what type of pain that she want from me)
Shes grindin on my waist, as if i wanna take her ass home 
so shes wrong
(What she doin, tell me what she doin P. she wanna ride it like a harley and i gotta seat)
Dat Dat Purrapttt Dat Dat (Spittin Game)
Dat Dat Purrapttt Dat Dat (Spittin Game)
Dat Dat Purrapttt Dat Dat (Spittin Game)
Dat Dat Da Dat Dat Dat Oh 

[Sean Garrett]
She spent the next 6 or 7 songs showin off things
The clubs in America wouldnt let her get away wit
Tossin up, Poppin off, See through cavali skirt
Her friends say she got money to spend on me
Then she pulled a lil stunt on that bar
Looked at me and then threw me the keys to her car
She doin splits on the table, still windin wit a bottle
gettin kinky in french and you know what she means

[Chorus - Pharrell]
She smilin in my face, with her breath smellin like patron,
 so whats wrong
(What she doin, tell me what she doin P. Im knowin just what type of pain that she want from me)
Shes grindin on my waist, as if i wanna take her ass home 
so shes wrong
(What she doin, tell me what she doin P. she wanna ride it like a harley and i gotta seat)
Dat Dat Purrapttt Dat Dat (Spittin Game)
Dat Dat Purrapttt Dat Dat (Spittin Game)
Dat Dat Purrapttt Dat Dat (Spittin Game)
Dat Dat Da Dat Dat Dat Oh 

[Sean Garrett]
Shes on the hood of my car 
beggin me to blow her (mind away)
and she insisted that we do it here
so all her favorite girls can see. 
she prefer both sides she told me
and i aint have no idea
she said, before i go theres a few of my girls
that i wanna leave here wit


[Chorus - Pharrell]
She smilin in my face, with her breath smellin like patron,
 so whats wrong
(What she doin, tell me what she doin P. Im knowin just what type of pain that she want from me)
Shes grindin on my waist, as if i wanna take her ass home 
so shes wrong
(What she doin, tell me what she doin P. she wanna ride it like a harley and i gotta seat)
