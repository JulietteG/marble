Take a break now, turn it around
Put my mind in a jamboree
Never felt that feeling that I can feel
When youre near to me

God knows Ive never given more
Than I do do do today, cause I
Give it back what youre giving to me
And theres a lot more coming in your way

Cause I can touch a new day
Just by playing in a new play
I have got some brand new thoughts
And you will be a part in all these

I like the smell of fresh hay
I wont stop right now to inhale
I have got some brand new flavours
Going in and out of my mind

Straight in from a lousy time
I took off on a cloudy day
Not knowing that a little climb
Could turn it in another way

It appears as a matter of fact
A little break off to the side
Can change more things that youve ever thought of
Aint no reason to hide

Cause I can touch a new day
Just by playing in a new play
I have got some brand new thoughts
And you will be a part in all these

I like the smell of fresh hay
I wont stop right now to inhale
I have got some brand new flavours
Going in and out of my mind

Come on over, listen to me
Enjoy your ride on my way to now
It might be you more clever than me
But we can complement
Each other somehow

Get back to the depth of your soul
And unwind on a hanging seat
You get more when you leave behind
Some of the things you dont really need

Cause I can touch a new day
Just by playing in a new play
I have got some brand new thoughts
And you will be a part in all these

I like the smell of fresh hay
I wont stop right now to inhale
I have got some brand new flavours
Going in and out of my mind---Lyrics submitted by Pascal.
