I get a feeling, everytime you're near
I get a feeling, can't explain my deal
But what a feeling
What'd you do to me?

I get a feeling, you come into view
We start lovin', don't care what you do
It's just a feeling
What'd you do to me?

I used to be the one
Cold as I could be
Nobody make me do a thing, now
I guess I met my match
'cause you put  an end to that
I'm like a puppet on a string now

I get a feeling, when you call my name
I get a feeling, honey it's a shame
But what a feeling
What'd you do to me?---Lyrics submitted by Andrea Mazzini.
