Yeah, 
they always want that fun shit when you tryna spit a little somethin' real
They start runnin'
Turnin' chicken like a nugget meal
How the fuck I feel?
Kinda like 100 mills
Spun the wheel
Bought a vowel
I don't owe you nothin' still

Fuck a deal
I can do it with my own team
Won before
Seen
Hearin' all these hoes scream
When I was 14
Sippin on my OE
Tryna marry money but that bitch kept gettin' cold feet
Music loud hear it bangin' through the whole street
Beat gettin' shit on
Toilet bowl seat
No sleep just work
Got a couple horny girls in a see-through shirt

So believe my hype
Mothafuckers can't read nor write
Still they talkin' shit 
Man I've seen your type
Got problems cant sleep at night
Cause your girl wanna come around freak all night
I'm a sex drill when I'm rollin' off them x pills
Five bikes
Ten wheels
Girl I'll leave your legs still
Say I don't do drugs just weed
Well I'mma do drugs and speed down the street
Do doughnuts
Your flow sucks
You so butt
Your girls' getting throat fucked
I get high, I go up
Why you sayin' that he's a tramp?
They come to all the shows just to meet your friends?


So much coke sniffed
Fuckin' hoes with bloody noses
Just a couple doses
Fuck the roses
Class time better take good notes
You bitches couldn't touch me with a facebook poke
BITCH---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
