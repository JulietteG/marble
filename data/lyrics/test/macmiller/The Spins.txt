Dope sugar like that, girl,
Oh hi,
Welcome back kids,
Uh, follow your dreams?
Yeah!

Wanna get a mansion,
A jacuzzi,
A theater to watch my movies,
Couple whips and lots of fancy things,
The kids they call 'em goonies,

I see the future, the crystal ball,
Mirror, mirror, hangin' on the wall,
Who the flyest white boy of them all?

Gotcha girlfriend screenin' all the calls,
She bubblin',
We fuckin',
Then you cuddlin',

Like, "Baby, where the fuck you been?"
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him,
So, so we ain't sayin' nothin,
You could prolly tell she bluffin',

Cause she kiss you with the mouth, 
She gave me head with,
My concussion,

Yeah she blushin', all red,
Wanna rush and go to bed,
So you interrogate that bitch like you the Feds,
So she says,

She in love with a rockstar, rockstar,
Wanna smoke my weed,
So she ask me where the tops are,
Tops are,

Oh, top drawer, Oh, Oh,
Only I need you high,
I'm low, I'm low,
Just some motherfuckin' kids,

Oh, Oh, Oh,
Honey, I need you round',
Only I need you high, 
I'm low, I'm low,

Yeah, I know, I know,
Hey Jerm, Hey,
These hoes is drunk,
Wanna come and smoke this blunt,

Then let me take 'em home,
And do anything I want,
I said, "Baby, I can ride ya,"
"Just let me get inside ya"

"I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizer"
I got that dope dick,
I'll be your supplier,
You grabbin' on my sheets,

And hittin' notes like you Mariah,
Obsessed with me,
Undress a freak on ecstasy,
I'm out and then she textin' me,
Like, "Watchu doin' next week?" next week

Hear me now,
I'm down on knees and prayin',
Though my faith is weak,
Without you so, baby, 
Please give us, a chance,

Make ammends,
And I will stand up, til the end,
A million times,
A drillion times,

Oh, Oh, Oh,
Honey, I need you round',
Only I need you high,
I know, I know,

I just graduated high school!
Hey homie!
Don't be mad that your girl love me,
It's not my fault,
I'm just doin' me,
If she love me, let her love me,
Ya feel me?

So baby, smile,
Baby, don't cry,
I will only fly,
With you by my side---Lyrics submitted by Tara Bankert.
