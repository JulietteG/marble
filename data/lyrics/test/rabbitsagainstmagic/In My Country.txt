It's a long long way to Heaven from here
In my country

Our protectors like to keep us in fear
In my country

Jubilation, you have got to learn

After work we all like to go get a beer
In my country

It's correct to hate the foreigners and queers 
In my country

Jubilation, you have got to learn

Early Sunday morning
Got the wind in my hair
Miss Dallas Texas waiting in the Lexus
Don't want to know her, didn't have a brain at all

They'll make sure that no one swears anymore
In my country

It's okay for the rich to take from the poor
In my country

Jubilation, you have got to learn

Early Sunday morning
Got the wind in my hair
Backwater Florida waiting in the corner
Don't want to know her, didn't have a brain at all---Lyrics submitted by Michelangelo.
