Fungus hedge had a heart of ......
He died just around the post
Fungus hedge had a pet wish to to die young
shot some valium and now he's gone
and I can stand the pain
makes me high 
all my ..... is gone
since youre here
i can't feel the pain
feel the pain
i can't feel
makes me high
al my ..... has gone
since you're here
and i can't feel the pain
feel the pain
i can i
mrs hedge never gave that much for anyone
she died alone for him
mr hedge had a lot of love for his son
never owned and now he's gone
i can't stand the pain
makes me ......
all my ..... is gone
since you're here
i can't feel the pain
feel the pain
i can't feel
makes me .... 
all my ...... is gone
since you're here
i can't feel the pain
feel the pain
i can't care
i can cryyyyy
all my ..... is gone
since you're here
i can't feel the pain
feel the pain
i can't hide---Lyrics submitted by Maisie Fitz.
