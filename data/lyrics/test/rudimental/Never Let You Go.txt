You never gotta be that lonely
You never gotta get that alone
All you gotta do is call me
And I will never let you go

You never gotta be that lonely
You never gotta get that alone
All you gotta do is call me
And I will never let you go

I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go, never let you go

I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go, never let you go

You never gotta be that lonely
You never gotta get that alone
All you gotta do is call me
And I will never let you go

You never gotta be that lonely
You never gotta get that alone
All you gotta do is call me
And I will never let you go

I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go, never let you go

I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go, never let you go

You call me
And I'll never let you go
You call me
You call me

I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
I will never let you go, never let you go

Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go---
