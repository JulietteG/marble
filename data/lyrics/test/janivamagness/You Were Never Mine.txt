I saw someone again today 
Who remembered me and you 
They asked all the same old questions 
I gave the same excuse 
They said what a shame, 
what a shame 
To lose a love so fine 
But I never lost you, 
I never really lost you 
I never lost you, 
you were never mine

I kept on believing 
What I wanted to believe 
The unspoken promises 
That you could never keep 
But it's a sin, 
oh it's a sin 
To tell yourself a lie 
I never lost you, 
I never lost you 
I never lost you, 
you were never mine

Did you give me 
all you gave me 
Just because I needed you 
But when I needed 
all your love completely 
Was it more than you could do

Sometimes deep in the night 
When I hold you in my dreams 
I get lost in your loving touch, baby 
I can't believe how real it seems 
And I know, yes I know 
I'll have you 'till the end of time 
'Cause I never lost you, 
I never lost you 
I never lost you 
'cause you were never mine

I never lost you, 
I never really lost 
you How could I lose you, 
you were never mine---
