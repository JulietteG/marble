Burn, burn the house on fire
I'm so sick and tired
I can still remember your sound
It's cut cut cutting me
Down I'm locked and loaded
You're so milk and roses
And I am just a letdown of your hound
It's cut cut cutting me down
Like slow poison
Cut down, like slow poison

Sing me one more ...
I have found my angel
Ah-ah-oh
She walks upon the ground
It's cut cut cutting me
Down on the empty can
I'm a stranger in a strange, strange land
Gone, gone, just gone without a sound
It's cut cut cutting me down
Like slow poison
Cut down, like slow poison

And all of my dreams are only dreams
And all of my schemes are only schemes
And if this is my punishment
Then I want my card to fit

break ...

Burn burn the house on fire
I'm so sick and tired
I can still remember your sound
It's cut cut cutting me down
Like slow poison
Cut down, like slow poison
It's cutting me
Like slow poison---Lyrics submitted by Alma.
