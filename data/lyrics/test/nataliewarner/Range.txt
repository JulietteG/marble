It's been a while
I still can't find you
I'm waiting here
Like I'm supposed to

I can't pretend
That I'm not trying
You're where you belong
The space that you left echoes inside me

And I feel it in everyone else
In everything else
Nowhere is safe
Nothing is safe

I can't run away
I can't be the same
When you're still here in everything
I can't hear you say
That I'll be okay
But I feel you falling out of my range
How long will I wait
How long will it take
Til I don't know your face?

I went to our place
I thought I saw you
My heart can't replace
The piece you hold onto now

I feel it in everyone else
In everything else
Nowhere is safe
Nothing is safe

I can't run away
I can't be the same
When you're still here in everything
I can't hear you say
That I'll be okay
But I feel you falling out of my range
How long will I wait
How long will it take
Til I don't know your face?

I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
I'm still here

I can't run away
I can't be the same
When you're still here in everything
I can't hear you say
That I'll be okay
But I feel you falling out of my range
How long will I wait
How long will it take
Til I don't know your face?---Lyrics submitted by nyki.
