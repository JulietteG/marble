Strange bird, try to understand
Fly around in circles, catch you coz I can
Every day, my target might change
But I'm always gonna aim

You think that you know my face
And you think you've seen all of my ways
But I wonder what it would be like
If you'd open up your eyes

Gotta find a way, gotta find a way, gotta find a way
Gotta find a way, gotta find a way

I'll fit right inside your mind
Stretch to expand the sides
Drop me in the center
I answer to no lines
I'll get right inside your mind
You'll understand in time
What you get's not always like
What you think you'll find

My madness, no method or no type
I don't live for sadness, just learning to fly
Crazy strength made me free
If you let me in, maybe you will see

Gotta find a way, gotta find a way, gotta find a way
Gotta find a way, gotta find a way

I'll fit right inside your mind
Stretch to expand the sides
Drop me in the center
I answer to no lines
I'll get right inside your mind
You'll understand in time
What you get's not always like
What you think you'll find

Someday I'll make you see
That I'm different, different
Someday you'll see
That I'm not the person you thought I'd be

Let me in, it's not gonna hurt a bit
Surrender to a different hue
Can you picture it?
Let it go, coz I'm gonna find a way in

I'll fit right inside your mind
Stretch to expand the sides
Drop me in the center
I answer to no lines
I'll get right inside your mind
You'll understand in time
What you get's not always like
What you think you'll find---Lyrics submitted by nyki.
