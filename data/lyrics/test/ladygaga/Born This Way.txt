It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M 
Just put your paws up 
'Cause you were born this way, baby 

My mama told me when I was young 
We are all born superstars 
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on 
In the glass of her boudoir 

"There's nothin' wrong with lovin' who you are" 
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe" 
"So hold your head up, girl and you you'll go far, 
Listen to me when I say" 

I'm beautiful in my way, 
'Cause God makes no mistakes 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way 

Don't hide yourself in regret, 
Just love yourself and you're set 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way 
(Born this way) 

Ooo, there ain't no other way 
Baby, I was born this way 
Baby, I was born this way 
Ooo, there ain't other way 
Baby, I was born this way 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way 

Don't be a drag, just be a queen 
Don't be a drag, just be a queen 
Don't be a drag, just be a queen 
Don't be! 

Give yourself prudence and love your friends 
Subway kid, rejoice the truth 
In the religion of the insecure 
I must be myself, respect my youth 

A different lover is not a sin 
Believe capital H-I-M (hey, hey, hey) 
I love my life, I love this record and 
Mi amore vole fe yah 

I'm beautiful in my way, 
'Cause God makes no mistakes 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way 

Don't hide yourself in regret, 
Just love yourself and you're set 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way 

Ooo, there ain't no other way 
Baby, I was born this way 
Baby, I was born this way 
Ooo, there ain't other way 
Baby, I was born this way 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way 

Don't be drag, just be a queen 
Whether you're broke or evergreen 
You're black, white, beige, chola descent 
You're lebanese, you're orient 
Whether life's disabilities 
Left you outcast, bullied or teased 
Rejoice and love yourself today 
'Cause baby, you were born this way 

No matter gay, straight or bi 
lesbian, transgendered life 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born to survive 
No matter black, white or beige 
chola or orient made 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born to be brave 

I'm beautiful in my way 
'Cause God makes no mistakes 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way 

Don't hide yourself in regret, 
Just love yourself and you're set 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way, yeah! 

Ooo, there ain't no other way 
Baby, I was born this way 
Baby, I was born this way 
Ooo, there ain't other way 
Baby, I was born this way 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way 

I was born this way, hey! 
I was born this wayy, hey! 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way, hey! 

I was born this way, hey! 
I was born this way, hey! 
I'm on the right track, baby 
I was born this way, hey!---Lyrics submitted by Steph.
