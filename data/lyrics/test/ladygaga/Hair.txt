[Verse 1]
Whenever I dress cool,
My parents put up a fight
And if Im a hot shot,
Mom will cut my hair at night
And in the morning Im short of my identity
I scream Mom and Dad
Why can't I be who I wanna be?

I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to know, I am my Hair

[Chorus]
Ive had enough
This is my prayer
That Ill die living just as free as my hair

Ive had enough
This is my prayer
That Ill die living just as free as my hair

Ive had enough
Im not a freak
I must keep fighting to stay cool on the streets

Ive had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
Im as free as my hair

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
Just because
I want my friends to think that I am dynamite
And on Friday, rock city, high school dance
I got my bangs too high
That I don't stand a chance
A chance

I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to know, I am my Hair

[Chorus]
Ive had enough
This is my prayer
That Ill die living just as free as my hair

Ive had enough
This is my prayer
That Ill die living just as free as my hair

Ive had enough
Im not a freak
I must keep fighting to stay cool on the streets

Ive had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
Im as free as my hair

[Bridge]
I just want to be free, I just want to be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties

I don't wanna change,
And I don't wanna be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my Hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I am my Hair!

I'm my hair, I am my hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair-am my hair
I'm my hair-am my hair yeah!

[Chorus]
Ive had enough
This is my prayer
That Ill die living just as free as my hair

Ive had enough
This is my prayer
That Ill die living just as free as my hair

Ive had enough
Im not a freak
I must keep fighting to stay cool on the streets

Ive had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
Im as free as my hair ---Lyrics submitted by whosaysu.
