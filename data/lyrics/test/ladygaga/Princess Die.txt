Leave the coffin open when I go
And leave my pearls and lipstick on so everybody knows
Prettyll be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives so everybody sees

Bleach out all the dark, Ill swallow
Each peroxide shot, someone I know can save me from myself
Maybe Ill just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
Ill be a Princess Die and die with you

I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope, but I took pills and left a note

Im hungry from an anorexic heart
Ive been trying to tell you how I feel but was never very smart
Im wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
Ill do it in the swimming pool so everybody sees

Bleach out all the dark
Ill swallow each peroxide shot, volumes I know
Will love and save me from myself
Maybe Ill just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
Ill be a Princess Die and die with you

Princess Die, I want to see her cry
Princess Die, Princess Die
We want to watch her cry
Princess Die

Wish that I was strong
Wish that I was wrong
Wish that I could cope, but I took pills and left a note

And wish that I would go
In my rich boyfriends limo, oh oh
Right after he proposed
With a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold
With the papparazzi all swarming round
In my Louis Vuitton white button-down
Oh, its not that deep
So bob head your head for another dead blonde
Whose real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep

The final act of life will be in my own hands to do
Ill be a Princess Die and die with you, applaud approve---Lyrics submitted by Aldara Gonzalez.
