I want your ugly 
I want your disease 
I want your everything 
As long as its free 
I want your love 
(Love-love-love I want your love) 

I want your drama 
The touch of your hand 
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand 
I want your love

(Love-love-love I want your love) 

You know that I want you 
And you know that I need you 
I want it bad, your bad romance 

I want your love and 
I want your revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance 
(Oh-oh-oh--oh-oooh!) 
I want your love and 
All your lovers' revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance

I want your horror 
I want your design 
Cause youre a criminal 
As long as your mine

Your vertical stick 
Want you in my rear window 
Baby you're sick 
I want your love 
Love-love-love
