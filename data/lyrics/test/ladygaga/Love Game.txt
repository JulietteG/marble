Let's have some fun,
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
(x2)

I wanna kiss you
But if I do then I might miss you babe
It's complicated and stupid

Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess who wants to play,
Wants to play
i love game
i love game

Hold me and love me
Just want to touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds is enough for my heart to quit

Let's have some fun,
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love do you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dawn the love game?

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love do you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dawn the love game?

I'm on a mission,
And it involves some heavy touchin' yeah.
You've indicated your interest,
I'm educated in sex, yes.
And now I want it bad,
Want it bad.
i love game,
i love game.

Hold me and love me.
Just want to touch you for a minute.
Baby three seconds is enough for my heart to quit.

Let's have some fun,
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that dick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love do you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dawn the love game?

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love do you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dawn the love game?

I can see you staring there from across the block with a smile on your mouth and your hand on your huh
The story of us it always starts the same with a boy and a girl and a huh and a game!
And a game
And a game
And a game
A love game!

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love do you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dawn the love game?

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love do you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dawn the love game?

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love do you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dawn the love game?

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love do you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dawn the love game?---Lyrics submitted by Lady.
