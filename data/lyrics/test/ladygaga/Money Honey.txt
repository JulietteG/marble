Thats m-o-n-e-y..so sexy

Damn, I love the jam, the jet and the mansion. (Oh yeah)
And I enjoy the gifts and the trips to the islands.(Oh yeah)
Its good to live expensive
You know it, but my knees get weak intensive
When you give me k-kisses


Thats money honey, well I'm your lover and your mistress
Thats money honey
When you touch me, its so delicious
Thats money honey
Baby when you tell me the pieces
Thats money honey

Thats m-o-n-e-y...so sexy

Damn, I love the boat by the beach on the west coast. (Oh yeah)
And I enjoy some fine champagne
While my girls toast (Oh yeah)
Its good to live expensive
You know it but, my knees get weak intensive
When you give me k-kisses

Thats money honey, well I'm your lover and your mistress
Thats money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
Thats money honey
Baby when you tell me the pieces
Thats money honey

You know I appreciate
The finer things
But its not what makes me happy as baby (I can do without a thing)
The turn in loving is more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle oh baby...baby

K-K-K-Kisses...Thats money honey,
well I'm your lover and your mistress
Thats money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
Thats money honey
Baby when you tell me the pieces
Thats money honey

When you get making kisses..
Thats money honey, well I'm your lover and your mistress
Thats money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
Thats money honey
Baby when you tell me the pieces
Thats money honey

When you get making kisses..
Thats money honey, well I'm your lover and your mistress
Thats money honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
Thats money honey
Baby when you tell me the pieces
Thats money honey

That's m-o-n-e-y...so sexy---Lyrics submitted by charlotte.
