I, I want to wish you well
I didnt watch you go
Cause I suppose I dont know how
I, I will remember you
Not the way you left but how you lived
And what you knew

I, I want to feel your hands
I want to feel your fire burning
Right from where I stand

Ill find my way
Cause you showed me how

I, I want to know its you
When I hear your voice inside my head
Inside my room
I, want to touch the sky
I want to see the stars twinkle
Like they were your eyes

Ill find my way
You showed me
Ill find my way
Cause you showed me how

I, I want to smell your scent
I want to breathe the air I did before
Before you left

I, I want to wish you well
The only reason my heart beats
Is cause you showed it how

Ill find my way
You show me
Ill find my way
You show me
Ill find my way
Cause you showed me how
You show me how
You showed me how ---Lyrics submitted by Sam.
