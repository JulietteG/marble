Low down, once again
Well I'm strugglin' now
To get by, my friend

It's keepin' me up
Real late at night
I just can't settle down
My honky tonk life

Driftin' around 'bout a half past four
With the blues on my back
And a bottle on the floor
Drinkin' until I think I'm gonna fall down
'Cause my sweet little baby had to kick me Low down

Low down
Once again
Well I'm strugglin' now
To get by my friend
It's keepin' me up real late at night
Hell I can't settle down my honky tonk life

Driftin' around 'bout half past four
With the blues on my back
And a bottle on the floor
Drinkin' until I think I'm gonna fall down
'Cause my sweet little baby had to kick me lowdown

Low Down
Once again
Well I'm strugglin' now
Just to get by my friend---Lyrics submitted by Robert.
