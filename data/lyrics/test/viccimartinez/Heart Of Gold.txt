Babe I hate to leave you but its time to go
I'll go my way while you go yours
But theres just one thing that you have to know
You've got a heart, you've got a heart of gold

Its impossible to carry on when you're all I've ever known
You were the only one who gave me time to spread my wings and grow
But now the world is ours to finally see
But you have no time for me

So now I'm singing..
Babe I hate to leave you but its time to go
I'll go my way while you go yours
But theres just one thing that you have to know
You've got a heart, you've got a heart of gold
Yeah, you've got a heart of gold

And I hate to leave you baby
but I promise you I will never try to replace our memories
Nobody, baby, nobody's gonna change what you really, what you really mean to me
Because we both know that this love cant hold 
but for right now we've got to set it free

Yeah, you've got a hear to gold(3x)
And I hate to leave you baby
But I've got to leave, I've got to leave you baby

You've got a heart, you've got a heart of gold. (4x)---
