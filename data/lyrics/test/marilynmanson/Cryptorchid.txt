each time i make my mother cry
 an angel dies and falls from heaven
when they get to you

when a boy is still a worm its hard to learn the number seven
 when they get to you

5 6 7 8 never
 first thing that they do 
7 8 9 10 heaven
when they get to you 
4 3 2 1 never get to seven

each time i look outside my mother dies
i feel my back is changing shape

when they get to you

when the worm consumes the boy 
its never ever considered rape
when they get to you

first thing that they do
when they get to you

prick your finger an its done 
the moon has now eclipsd the sun
the angel has spread its wings 
the time has come for bitter things

prick your finger an its done 
the moon has now eclipsd the sun
the angel has spread its wings 
the time has come for bitter things


prick your finger an its done 
the moon has now eclipsd the sun
the angel has spread its wings 
the time has come for bitter things

prick your finger an its done 
the moon has now eclipsd the sun
the angel has spread its wings 
the time has come for bitter things---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
