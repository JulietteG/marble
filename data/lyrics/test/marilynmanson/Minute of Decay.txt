There's not much left to love
Too tired today to hate
I feel the empty
I feel the minute of decay

I'm on my way down now
I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down now
I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down

The minute that it's born
It begins to die
I'd love to just give in
I'd love to live this lie

I've been to black and back
I've whited out my name
A lack of pain, a lack of hope
A lack of anything to say

I'm on my way down now
I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down 

The minute that it's born
It begins to die
I'd love to just give in
I'd love to live this lie

I'd love to live this lie


How do you see?
How do you know?

How do you see?
(I looked ahead and everything was dead)
How do you know?
(I guess that I am too)

How do you see?
(I looked ahead and everything was dead)
How do you know?
(I guess that I am too)

I guess that I am too


The minute that it's born
It begins to die
I'd love to just give in
Oh, I'd love to live this lie

I'd love to live this lie

I'm on my way down now
I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down
I'm on my way down now
I'd like to take you with me
I'm on my way down---Lyrics submitted by Christopher.
