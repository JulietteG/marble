There's something cold and blank behind her smile
She's standing on an overpass 
In her miracle mile 
[coma:]
"You were from a perfect world 
A world that threw me away today 
Today to run away"

A pill to make you numb 
A pill to make you dumb 
A pill to make you anybody else 
But all the drugs in this world 
Won't save her from herself

Her mouth was an empty cut 
And she was waiting to fall 
Just bleeding like a polaroid that 
Lost all her dolls 
[coma:]
"You were from a perfect world 
A world that threw me away today 
Today to run away"

A pill to make you numb 
A pill to make you dumb 
[chorus repeat]---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
