Oh, ah ah ah ah
Oh, ah ah ah ah, oh

Crushing, cheating, changing.
Am I deaf or dead?
Is this constricting construction
Or just streets with rusty signs
Of something violent coming?

Oh, ah ah ah ah
Oh, ah ah ah ah, oh

This'll hurt you worse than me.
I'm weak, seven days, I'm weak.
Don't run from me. I won't
Bother counting one, two, three...

I don't know which me that I love.
Got no reflection.
I don't know which me that I love.
Got no reflection.

Show myself how to make a noose
A gun's cliche, and a razor too
I'm not a deathshare vacation, vacant station
Made of scars and filled with my old wounds

Oh, ah ah ah ah
Oh, ah ah ah ah, oh

This'll hurt you worse than me.
I'm weak, seven days, I'm weak.
Don't run from me. I won't
Bother counting one, two, three...

I don't know which me that I love.
Got no reflection.
I don't know which me that I love.
Got no reflection.

You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you.
You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you.
You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you.
You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you.

I don't know which me that I love.
Got no reflection.
I don't know which me that I love.
Got no reflection.

No Reflection.
No Reflection.

I've got no reflection.---
