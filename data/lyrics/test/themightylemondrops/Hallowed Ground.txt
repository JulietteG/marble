From the heart
Of every city
In the wave
Of every tree
When the eye
Of what is dying
Is the core
Of every sea

You should believe it
Yeah yeah yeah
Declare your faith in
What you believe in
Yeah!

I follow down
To see her lying
On hollowed ground
Where she hangs out
With all the joy
Without the crying
And all the love
Without the doubt
And she believes it
Yeah yeah yeah
She has the faith in
What she believes in
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
What i want is
Always
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
What i want is
Always faith
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
What i need is 
Faith---Lyrics submitted by Kevin Olson.
