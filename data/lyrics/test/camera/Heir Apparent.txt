To listen is wise
Close your eyes
Sincerity has suited you well
You save lives
Just not mine
The struggle is what keeps you alive

This brave, ridiculous place 
All crazy from your whiplash
and your doubtful bouts of rage.
So you piss off
Ready or not
repeat your broken mantra that you're 'doing it for God'
You trace
Outline graves
of a crazy burning question of an issue left too late.
So you, slip fall
fail to answer the call of the many marching millions 
that are shedding tears of pain.

You take your time out of place
To find memories changed
I find your questions of touch
Afraid you like it too much
Ah haaa ohhhh oh
Ah haaa ohhhh oh
Ah haaa ohhhh oh

To listen is wise
Obey your fucking God---Lyrics submitted by Brian McGraw.
