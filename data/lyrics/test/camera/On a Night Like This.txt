I am the sun, the broken sun
Not bringing light to anyone
I am the sun, the broken sun.
You are the moon, the crescent moon
Appearing here to leave so soon.
You are the moon, the looming moon.

You're just a girl, I am a man.
You're just a girl, can't understand
What makes a man act like a man
You're just a girl, can't understand.

Come here girl, you look much older.
I'll put my arm around your shoulder.
To take you in, and show you places.
To see the looks on other's faces.

You're just a girl, I am a man.
You're just a girl, can't understand
What makes a man act like a man
You're just a girl, can't understand.

On a night like this.
On a night like this.
On a night like this.---Lyrics submitted by Brian McGraw.
