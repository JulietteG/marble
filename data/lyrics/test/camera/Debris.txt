Your city's underwater
All you children, sons and daughters have gone away
They've gone away
Your city is on fire
As the dead replace liars for what they must do
They must destroy you.

Your city is on fire as dead drag out the liars for what bring them through
They must rebuild you
Your city's underwater
All you children, sons and daughters have abandon you
Like you taught them to.

But I dont wanna run around, I don't wanna run around here
I dont wanna run around, I dont wanna run around here... anymore

But I dont wanna run around, I don't wanna run around here
I dont wanna run around, I dont wanna run around here... anymore

Fires come and fire go
You were always my hero
Fires come and fire go
You were always my hero

And the buildings, they will fall
What's a building after all?

And the buildings, they will fall
What's a building after all?---Lyrics submitted by Brian McGraw.
