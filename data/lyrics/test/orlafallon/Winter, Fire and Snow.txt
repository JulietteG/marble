In winter fire is beautiful, beautiful like a song
In winter snow is beautiful, all of the winter long

And you little son come safely home, writing the tell of the wind
May you always come this safely home, in winter, fire and snow

Today, its dark uneasily darker and darker steel
And you are gone to carnival and i fell the winter chill

And you little son come safely home, writing the tell of the wind
May you always come this safely home, in winter, fire and snow

And you little son come safely home, writing the tell of the wind
May you always come this safely home, in winter, fire and snow

In winter fire is beautiful, beautiful like a song
In winter snow is beautiful, all of the winter long
All of the winter long ---
