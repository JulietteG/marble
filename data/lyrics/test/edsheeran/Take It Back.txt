Im not a rapper Im a singer with a flow
Ive got habbit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
Cos plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signed to a label
But didnt listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didnt
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is the system
And you could say that Im driven
And now its onto the next saga
We drink the best larger
Ill never try to win you over like your step father
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And Im avoiding the caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But its safe to say it that kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
And 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I dont wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack Ill be singing the news
Tryin act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again thats what theyre supposed to do
And Im supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
Ill be ready to start again
By the end of the song
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong
But Ive never had an enemy
Except the NME but Ill be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
With all these spectacles ahead of me
And festival fess healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
Im battling for respect and I dont know if I have it
This song from the heart covers the planet
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
And take it back now
Now I dont ever wanna be perfect
Cos Im a singer you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someones got to win worst dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition
Cos every days a lyrics and the melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinth can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
Ill say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Its good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cos that how its supposed to be
Im screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving lifes dreams
But I just write schemes
Im never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that well never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, thats how we plan it out
Its time to take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No

Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No---
