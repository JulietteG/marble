This City never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens beat through my windowsill
Can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into

This tower is alive
With lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up, and lace untied
The street fils my mind
Can't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home
My home

Oh whoa
Burning on the back street

Oh whoa 
Stuck here sitting in the back seat

Oh whoa
I'm blazing on the street

What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up 
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to

The shop across the road
Fills my needs and brings me company
When I need it
Voices beat through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home
My home

Oh whoa
Burning on the back street

Oh whoa 
Stuck here sitting in the back seat

Oh whoa
I'm blazing on the street

What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

My lungs hurt 
And my ears bled 
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this 
To keep me alive
The traffic stops and starts but I
Need to move along

London call me a stranger
This is now my home
My home

Oh whoa
Burning on the back street

Oh whoa 
Stuck here sitting in the back seat

Oh whoa
I'm blazing on the street

What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two---Lyrics submitted by Katherine Dunck.
