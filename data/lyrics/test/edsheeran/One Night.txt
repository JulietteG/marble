Lying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence

Oh well, shes a local girl
No make-up
Cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

Is it fast food?
Ill regret it after
And I needed money
But Im too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her
And shes all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
Shes still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty and lastly

She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you dont, Ill tell her myself

And weve got that love in us
So if the drink kill us
Were gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
Say I hate wasps too
I dont really dance
So Ill just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if thats alright
I dont wanna be here
Im not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You dont mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What youre wearing

And I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone, oh.

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you dont, Ill tell her myself

Shes like the fast food
Ill regret it after
And I needed money
But Im too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that shes all I need

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you dont, Ill tell her myself

Now tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you dont, Ill tell her myself---
