If we take this bird in
With its broken leg
We could nurse it
She said
Come inside
For a little lie down with me
If you fall asleep
It wouldnt be the worst thing
But when I wake up
Your make-up is on my shoulder
And tell me, if I lie down
Would you stay now
And let me hold you?

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet
Mustnt get our feet wet
Cos that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And Ill owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird

If we take a walk out
In the morning dew
We could lay down
So Im next to you
Come inside
For a little home-made tea
If you fall asleep
Then at least youre next to me
And if I wake up
You see, its late, love
Go back to sleep
Im covered by nature
And Im safe now
Underneath this oak tree
With you beside me

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet
Mustnt get our feet wet
Cos that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And Ill owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird

And of all these things
Im sure of
Im not quite certain
Of your love
And you made me scream
But then I made you cry
When I left that little bird
With its broken leg to die

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste like lips do
And its not complete yet
Mustnt get our feet wet
Cos that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And Ill owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird
Youre my little bird---
