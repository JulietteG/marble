 When your legs dont work like they used to before
And I cant sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
Darlin I, will be lovin you
Till were seventy
And baby my heart
Could still feel as hard at twenty three
And Im thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey now
Take me into your lovin arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
Maybe we found love
Right where we are

When my hairs all but gone
And my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name
When my hands dont play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

Cos honey your soul
Could never grow old
Its evergreen
And baby your smiles
Forever in my mind and memory
Im thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe its all part of a plan
Ill just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that youll understand
That baby now
Take me into your lovin arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Baby we found love
Right where we are

Baby now
Take me into your lovin arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Baby we found love right where we are
Babe we found love right where we are---
