Its alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So dont wipe your eyes
Tears remind you youre alive
Its alright to die
Cos deaths the only thing you havent tried
But just for tonight
Hold on

So live life like youre giving up
Cos you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Its alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we rage
Against the dying of the light
Its alright to say that deaths the only thing you havent tried
But just for today
Hold on
So live life like youre giving up
Cos you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on

Live life like youre giving up
Cos you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
And hold on---
