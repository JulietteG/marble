This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when its late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I cant close my eyes
Dont control what Im into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Dont control what Im into

London calls me a stranger
A traveller
This is now my home, my home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isnt up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
Hey, and it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what Im used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I dont think Im gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger
A traveller
This is now my home, my home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isnt up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isnt up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two---
