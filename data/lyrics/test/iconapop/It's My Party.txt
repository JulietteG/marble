Uh huh, Uh huh
Uh huh, Uh huh

Don't know why he is not here
And I called him more than twice
But he won't pick up

Where the guys
I had a couple of friends come
Not the ones I really like
What the fuck

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, Cr-cr-cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry, Yeah yeah yeaahhh

I was gonna do it big,
Make it live for a hundred nights
I put my best dress on
All the prize, now the zipper broke in the back
So my cracks hanging out
I wish they all go home

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, Cr-cr-cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry, Yeah yeah yeaahhh

Uh huh Uh huh
Uh huh Uh huh

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, Cr-cr-cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry too if it happened to you

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
You would cry, Yeah yeah yeaahhh

Uh huh Uh huh
Uh huh Uh huh ---
