Working at the video store, every day's a bore, I just dream away
DVDs are gone for life, we just get online and go to Pirate Bay
Tripping like I'm on the moon and when I think of being in the disco light
Give me that bass right up in my face, I want glitter on the floor tonight

I want nothing like the others
I want more than I can take
I want nothing like the others
I want more than I can take

I want someone who can dance
Not someone I can talk to
I want someone who can dance

I want someone who can dance
Not someone I can talk to
I want someone who can dance
I want someone who can dance
Not someone I can talk to
I want someone who can dance

Feeling like a superstar in this boring bar, with my lipstick on
Body getting tense, waiting for my friends, I wonder where the hell they are
Yeah we kinda rule the world, when we go there, we will never stand in line
Seven days a week, no we never sleep, I want glitter on the floor tonight

I want someone who can dance
Not someone I can talk to
I want someone who can dance

I want someone who can dance
Not someone I can talk to
I want someone who can dance
I want someone who can dance
Not someone I can talk to
I want someone who can dance

Oh, I'm not insane
No, I'm not insane
We are not insane
No, we're not insane
(I want someone who can dance, not someone I can talk to)
No, I'm not insane
(I want someone who can dance, not someone I can talk to)
No, I'm not insane
(I want someone who can dance, not someone I can talk to)
We are not insane
(I want someone who can dance, not someone I can talk to)
No, we're not insane

I want someone who can dance
Not someone I can talk to
I want someone who can dance
I want someone who can dance
Not someone I can talk to
I want someone who can dance

If you look away, I make out with someone else
If you look away
If you look away, I make out with someone else
If you look away
I want someone who can dance---
