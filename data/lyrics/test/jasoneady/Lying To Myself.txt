I'm not really ready to be wrong
I been holding onto right a little too long
If I ever face the fact that I'm the one to blame
I might fall too far and not get up again

Chorus:
I might need forgiving these days
But for now I'll go on living this way
Running and a-fighting to survive
Lying to myself to stay alive

I've been telling all my friends why you're gone
Except the part about leaving you alone
All those nights when I was not around
I had my reasons then just like I have my reasons now

Chorus

Repeat chorus

Running and a-fighting to survive
Lying to myself to stay alive---Lyrics submitted by B Braud.
