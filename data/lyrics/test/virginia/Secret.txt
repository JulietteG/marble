Turn around. Did you see the other side of the road?
So don't slow down at the finish line.
Late night, try to sleep, please stop buzzing in my ear.
Hypnotized by your scent, I don't think I can forget.

Oh your hands with their soft touch, they make my head stop thinking.
And oh your eyes with their sweet look, they make my head start spinning.
And all my love has grown.
And all my love will drown.

Lost and found in my mind there's you with my best, and the words I can't say filling this blank page.
Blear sight, I can't see, but the tearing in my eyes.
Memorize all again, I don't think I can forget.

Oh your hands with their soft touch, they make my head stop thinking.
And oh your eyes with their sweet look, they make my head start spinning.
And all my love has grown.
And all my love will drown.

Do you know a secret is something that doesn't exist but maybe it's meant to be unknown.
People get a bit confused about what is worth to lose as the drink just starts settling in.

Oh your hands with their soft touch, they make my head stop thinking.
And oh your eyes with their sweet look, they make my head start spinning.
And all my love has grown.
And all my love will drown.---Lyrics submitted by Aaprimo Omirpaa.
