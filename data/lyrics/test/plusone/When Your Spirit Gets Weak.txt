We beg to borrow 
We beg to steal 
We beg forgiveness 
We beg to feel 
We beg for love 
I guess we beg for hate 
We beg for everything 
And pray it's not too late 

What everybody's tryna' feel 
I guess we're tryna' heal 
Everybody's got to kneel 
No way to reinvent the wheel 
Everybody's got to 
Stand up on their feet 
Everybody needs a dream 
When the spirit gets too weak 

Chorus 
So when you're spirit gets too weak 
When the water seems too deep 
When you think there's just no way 
I'll be there for you night and day 
When the mountain 
Seems too steep 
When your spirit gets too weak 
When you thinks there's just no way 
I'll be there for you night and day 

We beg for happiness 
We beg for tears 
We beg for courage 
Just to overcome our fears 
We beg to rise above 
And hope we never fall 
We beg for everything 
And pray he hears our call 

What everybody's tryna' feel 
I guess we're tryna' heal 
Everybody's got to kneel 
No way to reinvent the wheel 
Everybody's got to go 
Stand up on their feet 
Gotta be there for your brother 
When the spirit gets too weak 

Chorus 

Although the road is rough 
And sometimes you feel 
Like it ain't enough 
We'll be there for each other 
We'll find the way
