Where ever you are
tonight girl
Ill see you in my dreams,
Wherever i go tomorrow,
Youll be here next to me,

[refrain]
And though we are a world apart
I know youll never be that far,

[chorus]
Coz here in my heart
Theres a picture of her,
Together forever unfading and unbroken
Wherever you are, your love covers me
Forevermore, youll be in my heart

Whenever I miss,
miss you so much
its often I can think,
no i won't cry, Ill just close my eyes
and know, youll be there
youre kiss and youre touch
Ill never forget
Coz youre as close as my very next friend
{chorus}{refrain-chorus}
