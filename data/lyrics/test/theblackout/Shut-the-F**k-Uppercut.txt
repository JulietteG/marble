I'm sorry we took this from you
Did you know you were never gonna take it back
I'm sorry we left you behind
you need to know it was never our plan of attack
I'm sorry we took your crown
We never wanted to become enemies
I'm sorry we made up your mind
You can't bring us down!

And you'll never know
Never get it right
Coming in for you, going in for the kill
Just like we always will.

I'm sorry for what we've done
The time has come to throw this shit away.
I'm as surprised as you
I didn't know how deep it would cut your pride
We gone and left you behind
There's no apologies for what we've done
We're better than your kind
You can't bring us down.

And you'll never know
Never get it right
Coming in for you, going in for the kill
Just like we always will.

You can't bring us down
We're the best in town (X4)---Lyrics submitted by Sophie.
