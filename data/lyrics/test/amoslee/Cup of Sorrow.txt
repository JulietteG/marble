I want to drink from your cup of sorrow
I want to bathe in your holy blood 
I want to sleep with the promise of tomorrow
Although tomorrow may never come

I'll send a prayer out across the ocean
To a man being forced out of his home
I'll send a prayer out across the ocean
So he may not suffer there alone

I want to drink from your cup of sorrow
I want to bathe in your holy blood 
I want to sleep with the promise of tomorrow
Although tomorrow may never come

I want to sit at your table of wisdom
So that not one crumb shall go to waste
For if we keep down this pathway to destruction
Oh well, our children will suffer for our hate

I want to drink from your cup of sorrow
I want to bathe in your holy blood 
I want to sleep with the promise of tomorrow
Although tomorrow may never come
Although tomorrow may never come
Although tomorrow may never come---Lyrics submitted by Lisa Thayer.
