You speak of love 
But you ain't no lover 
You were a friend 
More like a brother 

As the miles pass beneath me 
The sounds made so sweetly came to an end 
And no man can deny her but now you're a liar 
And you've no room left to defend 

When I left 
I should have known better 
Of the kind of man that you are 
You'd have to get her 

And I know you got a lot of pain 
That's born inside you 
But instead of growing stronger 
You let it divide you, oh 

How could you be so careless 
How could you be so careless 

And the waves that are crashing 
True lives of passion washing on your shore 
Yes Sir, life has been costing 
A true love's been lost 
And I can't get back anymore 

And I'm sure 
That we both still both love her 
And it's a shame we both lost her 
And in time lost each other 

But a trust has been broken 
And words have been spoken 
But you can mend 
And no man can deny her 
And as you laid beside her 
I hope it felt good my friend 

How could you be so careless 
How could you be so careless 
How could you be so careless with her heart---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
