Go ahead, Baby, run away again
Growing tire of chasing you
I know you only have time to love me
When you got nothing better to do

Who's bold enough to believe
In either love or war
Both just leave you busted and broken down
Wanting more

Baby, I've seen it all before
Honey, I've seen it all before
Know that I've seen it all before
I ain't gonna be your fool anymore

I can hear my heart pounding
Oh but I just can't decide
Stuck between the depths of my fears
And the peaks of my pride

Baby, I've seen it all before
Honey, I've seen it all before
Know that I've seen it all before
I ain't gonna be your fool anymore

I've seen your tricks and I've seen your trade-offs
I've seen your evil ways
I've seen everything your twisted smile conveys

And I ain't gonna be your fool, Baby
I ain't gonna be your fool, Baby
I ain't gonna be your fool, Baby
I ain't gonna be your fool, Baby
I ain't gonna be your fool, Baby
I ain't gonna be your fool, Baby
Anymore---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
