Every night I go to sleep
The blues fall down like rain
Every night I go to sleep
The blues fall down like rain
Taking pills, cheap whiskey
Just to try to ease the pain

Well it's hard to gamble
When you lose every bet
Hard to save money
When you're twenty years in debt
The blues is falling
Falling down on me like rain
I'm gonna take a shotgun now people
And disconnect my brain
Matt 'Guitar' Murphy!

I made some mistakes
Had some bad breaks
Now my mind don't work
And my whole body aches
The blues is falling
Falling down on me like rain
My life is like water
Just swirling down the drain

Well I tried standin' up
I keep on falling down
Tried standing up
Keep on fallin' down
Everywhere I go
The blues is all around---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
