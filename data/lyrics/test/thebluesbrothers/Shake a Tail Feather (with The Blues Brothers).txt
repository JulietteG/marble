Well I heard about the fellow you've been dancin' with
All over the neighbourhood
So why didn't you ask me baby?
Didn't you think I could?

Well I know that the boogaloo is outta sight
But the shing-a-ling's the thing tonight
Would it happen to me and ya baby?
I wanna show you how to do it right...

Do it right. Uh huh. Do it right.
Do it right, do it right, do it right
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Twist it! Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it baby!
Here we go loop di loo!
Shake it out baby!
Here we go loop di lie!

Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Twist it! Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it baby!
Here we go loop di loo!
Shake it up baby!
Here we go loop di lie!

Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Come on! Come on baby! Come on! Yeah come on babe!
