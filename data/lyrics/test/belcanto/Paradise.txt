Only for this moment, let me be the one to hold you tight
I'll hush the anguish and the fear with a lullaby
If the stormy waters seize you in your restless sleep, I will safely
pull you out of the deep

Don't ask me why, don't ask me if
Can't you see, you're my blood?
Say you'll put your trust in me although it aches
We'll make the demons go without a trace

Mary, don't go
We'll find paradise in the end
Maybe
Hol on to paradise baby

In a whisper I once heard you vaguely: "I'm in a boat alone in the
raging sea"
We could calm those waves, you and I
We could row the other side
Mary

Hold on

Mary, don't go
We'll find paradise in the end
Maybe
Hold on
It will be paradise one day
Mary, my blood
I will be your side till the end
Marry me my blood and I will be your side till the end, till the end
We could row the other side
Mary---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
