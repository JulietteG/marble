You're far away, so far away
Have to believe that you can still feel me
And I can only wait and miss you
Now we're locked in time, out on the wire
I wish that I could fight the war for you
I'm always on your side
If I could trade places, you know I would

Hold on
Don't let go
Just stay on that road in that heartbeat
You're not alone in the dark, can you see me

Cause I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home

I'll never leave, you know I won't
I feel you're close, you're coming back to me
And summer may be over
But she leaves you her song

Hold on
Don't let go
Just stay on that road in that heartbeat
You're not alone in the dark, can you see me

Cause I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home

Cause I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires
Oh whoa

Just stay on that road in that heartbeat
You're not alone in the dark, can you see me

Cause I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'll be lighting fires, fires, for you
I'm there in the light when you need me, to find your way home---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
