Spooky scary skeletons
Send shivers down your spine.
Shrieking skulls will shock your soul
Seal your doom tonight.

Spooky scary skeletons
Speak with such a screech.
You'll shake and shudder in surprise
When you hear these zombies shriek.

We're so sorry skeletons
You're so misunderstood.
You only want to socialize
But I don't think we should.

Cuz' spooky scary skeletons
Shout startling shrilly screams.
They'll sneak from their sarcophagus
And just won't leave you be.

Spirits supernatural
Are shy whats all the fuss?
But bags of bones seem so unsafe
Its semi-serious.


Spooky scary skeletons are silly all the same.
They'll smile and scrabble slowly by
And drive you so insane.

Sticks and stones will break your bones
They sell them when you snooze
Spooky scary skeletons will

Wake

You

With

A

Boo.---Lyrics submitted by Shakeel Khan.
