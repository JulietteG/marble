I`ve been pushed, shoved
Gonna show them the good love
So down and lonely
I had to cry
I`ve seen my dreams break
Felt my heart ache
Sometimes livin
Only not to die  
Bobby its alright!
But me tell you that its alright
I`m a survivor
Gonna make it through
I`ve had to play tough!
Then throw`em all outta hard stuff
But I`m a survivor
Doin what I gotta do
I know I can make it through

Tonight I`m run in
My heart is crumblin
This night air chills me
It gets so cold
Born is a new day
Somethin`s comin my way
Where its gonna take me
I just don`t know

Bobby its alright!
Gonna tell you that its alright
I`m a survivor
Gonna make it through
I`ve had to play tough!
Then throw`em all outta hard stuff
But I`m a survivor
Doin what I gotta do
I know I can make it through

Hey its alright!
Gonna tell you that its alright
I`m a survivor
Gonna make it through  yeah
I`ve had to play tough
Then throw`em all outta hard stuff
But I`m a survivor
Doin what I gotta do
I know I can make it through---Lyrics submitted by Sophie Auger.
