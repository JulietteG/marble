She werent much to look at
she werent much to ride
she was missing a window 
on the passenger side 

the floor boards patched up
with paper and tar
but i really want something
for my old yellow car

an american girl with her hands on the wheel
of a dream that is made of american steel
oh the seats have the smell of a nickle cigar i really want something for my old yellow car

somewhere in a pile of rubber and steel
theres a rusty old shell of an automobile
and if engines could run on desire alone
that old yellow car would be driving me home

I remembered the songs that the radio played
loved for the first time
your man not afraid
to somebody somewhere
you know who you are
I cheerish that night in my old yellow car

somewhere in a pile of rubber and steel
theres a rusty old shell of an automobile
and if engine could run on desire alone
that old yellow car would be driving me home


take a look at me now
for when running around
i am paying somebody 
to drive me down town
got a mercedez benz
with a tv and bar
God i wished i was driving
my old yellow car
god i wished i was driving
my old yellow car---Lyrics submitted by Leanne.
