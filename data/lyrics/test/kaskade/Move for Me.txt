Another night out, another dance floor (x2)

Here we go, another night out
Waited all week, just to get out
Where do we come from
Do I know your name
Doesn't really matter
In this life we're all the same

Move for me, I'll move for you (x4)

A DJ, a light show
Speakers puttin out
It's where we're going
This way and that way
Getting past the name
Doesn't really matter
In this life we're all the same

Move for me, I'll move for you (x2)

Another night out, another dance floor (x6)---Lyrics submitted by Leona.
