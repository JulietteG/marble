Blue road, half a mile, 
Distant wing of your missing smile 
Long journey, is that all I can get? 
Blue road, half a mile, 
Hear me out for a little while 
Flash in the eye that I can't forget 
Little more, little more, little more 
Little more loving 
Little more, little more, little more 
Little more loving 
Give me little more, little more, little more 
Little more loving 
Little more, little more, little more, little more 
Loving!! 

Blue road, almost mine, 
Wave goodbye, now a faded line 
This memory is it all that I get?! 
Tell me I'm fine, 
Echoing through a clouded mind 
Please wake me up, so I won't forget! 
Little more, little more, little more 
Little more loving 
Little more, little more, little more 
Little more loving 
Give me little more, little more, little more 
Little more loving 
Little more, little more, little more, little more 
Loving!!---
