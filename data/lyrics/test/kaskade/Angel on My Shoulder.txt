It's time you see,
The love you give,
Is killing me, And I want to live,
This isn't right you search your soul for life,
So I'm turning left, I turn myself,
I could be as bad as someone else,
But I find it hard when an angel's on my right,

(Chorus)
You held my hand and took me right back down to hell, 
I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my head, (x2)

Wont you go, When no means no,
Your dirty life is like a one mans show,
Your a night attack when you turn the light to play,
So I'm turning left I turn myself,
I could be as bad as someone else,
But I find it hard when an angel's on my right,

(Chorus)
You held my hand and took me right back down to hell, 
I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my head, (x2)

Talk to me,
Walk with me,
Come with me,
Beautiful lady,
Beautiful lady,
Will you come and save me,
Come to me,
Come back here,
Walk with me,
Come back here,

(Chorus)
You held my hand and took me right back down to hell, 
I have an angel on my shoulder but a devil in my head, (x2)

Come back here (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Menoncle Cochon.
