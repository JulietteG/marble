It's you, only you can be everything to me
Only you.
How I'd try to deny or hide?
Put away my pride, only you

I'll repeat this phrase through all my days,
With my last breath, only you
I'll repeat this phrase through all my days,
With my last breath, only you

Only you (repeat this phrase) - x8

And it shows, because my heart beats so,
I will always know, only you.
Beautiful, anekatips so beautiful,
All this love is full, only you

I'll repeat this phrase through all my days,
With my last breath, only you
I'll repeat this phrase through all my days,
With my last breath, only you---Lyrics submitted by Peony  Liu.
