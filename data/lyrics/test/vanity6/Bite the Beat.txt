Bite the beat
It tastes so good
Bite it til your satisfied. 
Aint nothing wrong with dancing all night long-
You can still be dignified.

When I first saw your teeth I knew you were the only one qualified
To bite the beat 
Dont try to call your mother
Just bite it til your satisfied-all you do is bite the beat

Bite the Beat
Come on baby bite the beat
Bite the Beat

Bite the beat 
It wont make you sick
Come on- bite the beat of a star
Dont worry you'll still be dignified it tastes like cavier.

When I first saw your teeth I knew you were the only one qualified
To bite the beat
Dont try to call your mother
Just bite it til your satisfied-all you do is bite the beat.

Bite the Beat
Come on honey bite the beat
Bite the Beat

Bite the beat
It'll do you no harm unless you choke on a guitar string
Peanut butter, thoughts of love...I wanna dance- I dont wanna sing.
Check it.
(music interlude)

Ah- bite the beat. 
Bite the beat.
Come on baby bite the beat. 
Bite the beat.

Bite the beat 
It wont make you sick 
Come on bite the beat of a star
Dont worry you'll still be dignified- it tastes like cavier. 

Bite it
That's right...there are no more wet dreams for Brenda-
At least not tonight ah come on- bite it (laughter)
Bite the beat
