[Verse 1:]
Bitches think I'm crazy but I'm normal
I just come off as a psycho maniac when I'm performing
That's an act so I won't bore you to death
Cause I adore you... and it's the summer so

[Hook:]
Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

[Verse 2:]
You can bring your bitches, I'm a bring my niggas
You can practice liking I, I'm a practice that guitar, baby
It's summer camp Golf Wang where the talking trees are
You and girls can brawl if you

[Hook]

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If you meet me by the pier, bring the beer, we can menage
Ooh, your girl friend Nicki gots the back I like to massage
I'll be in the city with them actresses
The Nissan is down there in the bottom of the lake
I'll make sure you have a good time, a good time
I'll make sure it's a good time, a good time for you

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Love sick, where's the clinic aid we're young
Fun is what we're having, fuck it, pour a glass of lemonade
It's snowcone and poptarts I got and I got you
Let me take a dip and you can take a break
That's only if you meet me by the lake

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Could you meet me by the lake? (Drown today)

[Silence]

[Intro: Syd tha Kyd]
Meet me at the lake round ten (Come through)
Meet me at the lake round ten (It's cool, wanna kick it)

[Hook:]
Meet me by the lake at ten
If I'm not there just call
And if you need a way there
I'll ride you on my handle bars

[Bridge: Syd tha Kyd]
Kissing under moonlight
I can bring you to our tree house
We'll be fucking on the rooftop
If you're not down, we can just make out

[Hook]---
