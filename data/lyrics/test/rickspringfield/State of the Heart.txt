Just a state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

I know your name
I told you mine
We've stopped and passed the time of day
You work in town
I work at night
That gives us six until seven to work this out

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

You are the moon
I am the sea
You pull me in and gaze on down at me
I was alone
I thought I was immune
It's good to know
The door can still be open wide

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

It's just the state of the heart
I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

We get closer and closer
To falling out or falling in
I go over and over
But I can't change the state
This heart is in

If I seem a little strange
It's just the state of the heart
I'm waiting here for you
In the state I'm in

It's just the state of the heart
You know I wait in the dark
In the state I'm in

It 's the state of the heart
State of the heart
The state of the heart
State of the heart

Woe, oooo

The state of the heart
State of the heart
The state of the heart
State of the heart

Woe, oooooo---Lyrics submitted by NESTOR.
