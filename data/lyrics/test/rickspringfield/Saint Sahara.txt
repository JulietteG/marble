Come on, close the book and turn out the light
Put your plans aside tonight
Yeah I know its not wrong but it sure isnt right
An angel bids a last goodnight to us

Come on Sahara, give us a smile.
Youve walked this far with us lets walk one more mile
Hey Saint Sahara, beautiful child.
You left us all wanting, you left us beguiled
Mi Ma Mi Mi Ma Mi Mi Ma Mi Mi Ma Mi

You take your solace where you find it
Dress the wound and tightly bind it
You so want the past but you cant rewind it
And she sleeps with angels tonight

Come on Sahara, give us that smile
Youve walked this far with us lets walk one more mile
Hey Saint Sahara, beautiful child.
You played you best hand but the Joker was wild
Mi Ma Mi Mi Ma Mi Mi Ma Mi Mi Ma Mi
Come on Sahara Hey Saint Sahara

Come on Sahara, you fought the good fight.
Baby let go, everythings all right

Come on Sahara Hey Saint Sahara
Hey Saint Sahara Yeah Come on Sahara beautiful child---Lyrics submitted by krista.
