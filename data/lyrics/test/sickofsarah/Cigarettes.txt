I'm beginning to feel just like a book.
I folded some pages I think you overlooked.
Words you've read you couldn't see.
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.

And more than I could ever paint.
I used all the colors I stored inside my bank.
My favorite shade, el paso blue,
Reminds me, reminds me of you.

Woah, this isn't what you asked for.
No, this isn't what I asked for.

You say it might be better.
No its never, its never, its never.
And you say it might take longer.
No its never its never its never.
And you say, Oh, it makes us stronger.
No its never, its never, its never.
And you say...

If I had a choice I'd be a saint,
But I am a sinner who is over it, over it.
Call it a loss or call it fate.
It's still a beautiful, beautiful thing.

Under and in, over and out.
Time takes time to weather.
Give me some space and I'll pretend,
I'll make you believe me again.

Woah, this isn't what you asked for.
No, this isn't what I asked for.

You say it might be better.
No its never, its never, its never.
And you say it might take longer.
No its never its never its never.
And you say, Oh, it makes us stronger.
No its never, its never, its never.
And you say, believe.

Catch me if you can.
Catch me if you can.
Cause we're falling and falling and falling to pieces and pieces.

This isn't what you asked for.
You say it might be better
No, it's never, it's never, it's never
You say it might take longer
No, it's never, it's never, it's never
And you say, it makes us stronger
No, it's never, it's never, it's never

And you say believe. Believe.---Lyrics submitted by kristin.
