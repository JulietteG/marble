So we'll be taking our time,
you know the backseats lovers want to watch you fall.
Turn it over to the flipside,
looking for your answers, your route to crawl.

And you'll tell all of your friends you met a little someone special who likes to dance.
Ohh but they'll be waiting for the kickbacks
Ripping on the rejects they call their friends.

And we sang,
(ah, ah, ah)
No, it's not that we can't feel.
(ah, ah, ah)
We're just hoping that it's real
(ah, ah, ah)
And it's not a place in time
We're just hoping that you'll find
Something we might have left behind.

And you know its better in the back,
and you're waiting for me.
And I'll give anything you ask girl
Anything you wanted, as long as it's free.

Oh, and I'll tell all of my friend I met a little someone special who likes to dance.
Ohh but they'll be waiting for the kickbacks
Ripping on the rejects they call my friends.

And we sang,
(ah, ah, ah)
No, it's not that we can't feel.
(ah, ah, ah)
We're just hoping that it's real
(ah, ah, ah)
And it's not a place in time
We're just hoping that you'll find
Something we might have left behind.

Tell me do you like it?
(repeat)

It's not that we can't feel.
We're just hoping that it's real.
It's not a place in time.
We're just hoping that you'll find
Something we might have left behind.

(ah, ah, ah)
No, it's not that we can't feel.
(ah, ah, ah)
We're just hoping that it's real
(ah, ah, ah)
And it's not a place in time
We're just hoping that you'll find
Something we might have left behind.


It's not that we can't feel.
We're just hoping that it's real.
It's not a place in time.
We're just hoping that you'll find
Something we might have left behind.---Lyrics submitted by kristin.
