Hey cowboy,
Did you get my letter?
I wrote it to you from across the sea.
Hey cowboy,
this is your cowgirl,
still loving you from half way 'cross the world.

Hey cowboy,
I hope you didn't forget me,
I know things are tough this far apart.
But I've been praying,
that you haven't found another 
and still hold a place for me inside your heart.

We don't talk like we used to do ...
Please don't tell  me it's because I'm losing you
Hey cowboy, this is your cowgirl
and I'm still loving you from half way 'cross the world.

Hey cowboy
Do you remember nights we laughed
Talkin' 'bout the present and the past?
And we put on records,
listened to old fashion songs.
Me and you were right where we belonged.

I know it's that it's been way too long ...
But please don't tell me that  you've stopped holding on.
Hey cowboy, this is your cowgirl
and I'm still loving you from half way 'cross the world.

I know that it's been way too long ...
Please tell me that you're still holding on.
Hey cowboy, this is your cowgirl
and I'm still loving you from half way 'cross the world.---Lyrics submitted by Monica C Garrison.
