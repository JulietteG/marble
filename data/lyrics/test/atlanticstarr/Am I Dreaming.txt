Thigns are kind of hazy
And my head's all cloudy inside
Now I've heard talk of angels
But never thought I'd have one to call my own
See,you are just too good to be true
And I hope this is not some kind of mirage with you

Am I dreaming
Am I just imagining you're here in my life
Am I dreaming
Pinch me to see if it's real cos my mind can't decide

Will this last for one night
Or do I have you for a lifetime
Please say that it's forever
And that it's not an illusion to my eyes
And I hope that you don't up an disappear
My love, oh I pray that it's not a hoax and it's for real

Am I dreaming
Am I just imagining you're here in my life
Am I dreaming
Pinch me to see if it's real cos my mind can't decide

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes baby
I need you to show me, show me that it's not a mirage
Oh baby I need you, I need you, I need you to pinch me
Pinch me to see if it's real cos my mind can't decide
Tell me am I dreaming, oh yeah
Am I just imagining you're here in my life
I don't wanna be dreaming, oh no
Pinch me to see if it's real cos my mind can't decide
Am I dreaming
Am I just imagining you're here in my life
Am I dreaming---Lyrics submitted by Caretta.
