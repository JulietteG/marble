We shine like a new tattoo
Scarred on skin bright as day
Across my heart
There is no other way

Give me tomorrow
And  I 'll give you today
In the end
There is no other way

We are like two roads
That lead to the same place
Won't leave a trace
There is no other way

If you were all  I  had
I would have it all

Soul to soul we roam
Aimlessly astray
That's over now
There is no other way

Some days will be lost
We run out of words to say
We both know
There is no other way---
