Right or true
Im keepin all my love for you now, baby
hmmhmmmmmmmmm
me and you
we gonna change the world again now, maybe

we still have a lot of way to go
try to remember that we just went together
we still have a lot of time to do
just remember we both be forever

shame on you
you lighted on your life on yourself, maybe
ahhaaaa
weave alone
we came from far away for you now, lady

we still have a lot of way to go
try to remember that we just went together
we still have a lot of time to do
just remember that we both be forever

Lie or truth?
Im givin all my love for you now, baby
oh yeah
we were ruled (?)
we came from far away for you now, lady
oh yeah

we still have a lot of way to go
try to remember that we just went together
we still have a lot of time to do
just remember we both be forever
