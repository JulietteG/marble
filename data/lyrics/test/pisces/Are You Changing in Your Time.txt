It's not like you to understand
It's not like you to dream of me
Am I sitting in the palm of your hand?
Are you gonna make a fool of me?

Every night I used to ask you
And time and time again you told me no

I wish I knew,
I've got to know

Are you changing in your time?
Are you waking in your prime?

Mmm...

Something there is warning me
Something down and easy to see
Why can't I read it in your mind?
Why do you make it hard to find?

Every night I used to ask you
And time and time again you told me no

I wish I knew,
I've got know

Are you changing in your time?
Are you waking in your prime?---Lyrics submitted by Tits.
