Well theres a river that runs through Glasgow
And makes her but it breaks her and takes her into the parks
And her current just like my blood flows
Down from the hills, round aching bones to my restless heart

Well I would swim but the river is so wide
And Im scared I wont make it to the other side
Well God knows Ive failed but He knows that Ive tried
I long for something thats safe and warm
But all I have is all that is gone
Im as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde

Well on one side all the lights glow
And the folks know and the kids go where the music and the drinking starts
On the other side where no cars go
Up to the hills that stand alone like my restless heart

Well I would swim but the river is so wide
And Im scared I wont make it to the other side
Well God knows Ive failed but He knows that Ive tried
I long for something thats safe and warm
But all I have is all that is gone
Im as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the Clyde

Well the sun sets late in Glasgow
And the daylight and the city part
And I think of you in Glasgow
Cos youre all thats safe, youre all thats warm in my restless heart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
