Well when youre with your friends,
But youre lonely,
You smile a smile thats not your own,
When comfort comes from a strangers arms,
Miles away from home,

And you close your eyes to feel a darkness,
You dream of love you have known,
But you wake up instead,
In a strangers bed,
Miles away from home,

Though youre in a house,
Dont mean its a home,
Though youre in a crowd,
Doesnt mean youre not alone,
Doesnt mean youre not alone,

And though he wraps you in wool,
Youre still freezing,
Its been a while since youve been warm,
Cos youre making false starts,
With a strangers heart,
Miles away from home

Though hes on your skin,
Doesnt mean hes in your blood,
Though you let him in,
Doesnt mean youre making love,
Doesnt mean youre making love

Cos youre not in love

Cos you know my house will always be your home,
You know my heart is yours and yours alone,
Is yours and yours alone,
You know my house will always be your homes,
You know my heart is yours and yours alone,
Is yours and yours alone.---
