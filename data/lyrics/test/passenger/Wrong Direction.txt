When I was a kid, the things I did, were hidden under the grid
Young and naive, I never believed that love could be so well hid
With regret, I'm willing to bet, you say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive and harder to forget

It gets under your shirt like a dagger or work
The first cut is the deepest, but the rest will flippin' hurt
You build your heart of plastic, get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own

'Cause I love to feel love but can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close, but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction
Oh, no

So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up
When you're coked up,
And can't remember the reason why you broke up
You call her in the morning
When you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road

'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you want to be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies, they flutter by
And leave us on our asses

'Cause I love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close, but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
'Cause all I want to do is try to make a connection
But it seems I've been running in the wrong direction
Oh, oh

Oh, oh I love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close, but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

I love to feel love but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
And I thought I was close, but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

Oh, oh
Seems like I'm running in the wrong direction
Oh, oh
Seems like I'm running in the wrong direction
Oh
Well it seems I've been running in the wrong direction
Oh, no
Seems like I've been running in the wrong direction
Oh---Lyrics submitted by Andreas Riedl.
