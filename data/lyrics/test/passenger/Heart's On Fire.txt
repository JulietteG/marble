(feat. Ed Sheeran)

If my true love's gone
I will surely find another
And to her I will sing
Things that make her know I want her
So would you go, lassie, go
And we'll all go together
Where the wild mountain thyme
Grows around bloomin' heather
Would you go, lassie, go

Well, I don't know how, and I don't why
But when something's living, you can't say die
You feel like laughing, but you start to cry
I don't know how, and I don't know why

Well, I don't have many, and I don't have much
In fact I don't have any, but I borrow enough
'Cause I know those eyes, and I know that touch
I don't have many, and I don't have much

But oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
For you

Well, I don't know where, and I don't when
But I know we'll be lovers again
I'll see you some day before the end
I don't know where, and I don't know when

But oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
You know those love songs break your heart
You know those love songs break your heart
You know those love songs break your heart

Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
For you.---
