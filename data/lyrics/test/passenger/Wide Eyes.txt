Well I've not seen Alaskan white
And I've not seen Tokyo by night
And I've not seen the northern lights
But I have seen your wide eyes tonight

And I've not done all I could have done
And I have walked when I could have run
And I have lost all I could have won
But your wide eyes reflect and move on

And I have found a hole in my coat
And I have found a lump in my throat
And I have laughed at all my own jokes
But your wide eyes are like water to a boat

And I have never packed my case
Gone underground or out into space
When my gaze rests heavy on your face
Well, your wide eyes are my favorite place
Well yeah, your wide eyes are my favorite place---Lyrics submitted by Sharette Kern.
