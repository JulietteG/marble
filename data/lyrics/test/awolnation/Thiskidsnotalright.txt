Troubles coming for the free men.
We shake them, shake them with the free hand.
So stand tall, shout out with me.

Do your dirty work without me.
Say you're best when no one can see.
Stand up, catch fire with me.

(This kid, this kid, this kid, this kid, this kid)

This kid's not alright.
This kid's not alright.
This kid's not alright.
But this kid's not alright.

I've been sleeping with these,
I've been sleeping with these thoughts, man
I've been contemplating singing them.
So stand up, catch fire with me.

(This kid, this kid, this kid, this kid, this kid)

You can follow them to hell.

This kid's not alright.
This kid's not alright.
This kid's not alright.
But this kid's not alright.

I'm scared, I may derail.

You can follow them to hell.
You can follow them to hell.
You can follow them to hell.
You can follow them to hell.
You can follow them to hell.

This kid's not alright.
You can follow them to hell.
This kid's not alright.
You can follow them to hell.
This kid's not alright.
You can follow them to hell.
But this kid's not alright. ---
