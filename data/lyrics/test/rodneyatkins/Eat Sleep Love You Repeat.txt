Now girl you know I'm a rebel
I fly by the seat
I ain't into lookin'
Too far down the street
I ain't ever had no schedule
Hangin' on my fridge
But if I did, baby
It would look like this

I said, eat sleep love you repeat
Pour a little drinkin' in the mix
And I'll be like sweet
If it's alright with you
All I wanna do is
Is eat sleep love you repeat

I might gig a big ole frog
On a lazy summer night
Squeeze in some work
When the piggy bank gets light
Catch a little football
Pick a little six string
Long as it don't throw no wrench
In my routine

I said, eat sleep love you repeat
Pour a little drinkin' in the mix
And I'll be like sweet
If it's alright with you
All I wanna do
Is eat sleep love you repeat

A little quesa to the dilla
A nap in a hammock every now and then
A little worm in my tequila
A little you on my lips
Let's do it again

Now I said, eat sleep love you repeat
Pour a little drinkin' in the mix
And I'll be like sweet
If it's alright with you
All I wanna do is
Is eat sleep love you repeat

I said, eat sleep love you repeat
That's what I'm talking about
I said, eat sleep love you repeat
I said, eat sleep love you repeat---
