It's hard to imagine
Breathing on my own
When every breath inside of me
Is tangled up in yours
It's hard to imagine
The sun without the moon
'Cause anything that's bright in me
Is only bouncing off of you

If I shine it's because of you
If I love it's because of you
If I'm strong it's because of you
It's all because of you

It's easy to think that
Religion is the light
When all I see is a hypocrite
Through the splinters in my eyes
It's easy to think that
I just made you up
When everyone I know
is scared of falling in love

If I shine it's because of you
If I love it's because of you
If I'm strong it's because of you
If I'm right it's because of you

I'm in love, in love, in, love
I'm in love, in love, in, love
I'm in love, in love, in, love
I'm in love, I'm in love

If I shine it's because of you
If I love it's because of you
If I'm strong it's because of you
It's all because
It's all because of you

It's all for you---
