I woke up in darkness
Surrounded by silence, oh where
Where have I gone?
I woke to reality
Losing its grip on me, oh where
Where have I gone?

'Cause I can see the light
Before I see the sunrise

You called and You shouted
Broke through my deafness
Now I'm breathing in and breathing out
I'm alive again

You shattered my darkness
Washed away my blindness
Now I'm breathing in and breathing out
I'm alive again

Late have I loved You 
You waited for me, I searched for You
What took me so long?
I was looking outside
As if love would ever want to hide
I'm finding I was wrong

'Cause I can feel the wind
Before it hits my skin

'Cause I want You
Yes, I want You
I need You
And I'll do whatever I have to
Just to get through
'Cause I love You
And I love You---Lyrics submitted by Terra.
