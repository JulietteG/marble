Let no one caught in sin remain
inside the lie of inward shame
we fix our eyes upon the cross
and run to him who show great love
and bled, for us
freely you bled, for us

Christ is risen from the dead
trampling over death by death 
come awake come awake 
come and rise up from the grave

Christ is risen from the dead
we are one with him again
come awake come awake
come and rise up from the grave

Beneath the weight of all our sin
we bow to none but heaven's will
no scheme of hell, no schoffer's crown
no burden great can hold you down
in strength you reign
forever let your church proclaim

Christ is risen from the dead
trampling over death by death
come awake, come awake
come and rise up from the grave

Christ is risen from the dead 
we are one with him again 
come awake, come awake 
come and rise up from the grave

oh death, where is your sting?
oh hell, where is your victory?
oh church, come stand in the light,
the glory of God has defeated the night!

Singin, Oh death, where is your sting?
oh hell, where is your victory?
oh church, come stand in the light 
our God is not dead He's alive! He's alive!

Christ is risen from the dead, 
trampling over death by death
come awake, come awake,
come and rise up from the grave

Christ is risen from the dead, 
we are One with Him again, 
come awake, come awake, 
come and rise up from the grave

Christ is risen from the dead,
trampling over death by death,
come awake, come awake,
come and rise up from the grave

Christ is risen from the dead, 
we are One with Him again,
come awake, come awake,
come and rise up from the grave
