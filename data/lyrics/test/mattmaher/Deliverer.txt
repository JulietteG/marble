I was a drifter, I had nowhere to go
I was hanging by threads of dust and bone
Every angel I knew was singing son come home
But the melody was hard to sing along

Oh God, Youre my deliverer
The One, the One who carries us
Oh God, Youre my deliverer

I was on trial for everything I did
And theres no way I could make a stand and win
When you realize the verdict is already in
You let go of the brokenness within
Well theres only One who can ever stand and win

Oh God, Youre my deliverer
The One, the One who carries us
Oh God, Youre my deliverer
The One, the One who carries us

And now Im like a child at night
Who never has to think of why
Were free to love and live and die
And theres no need to justify
The sinner thats inside of me
Has lost all his control of me

My God, from the flood and from the fire
You brought me out, I am alive
With a faith, just like a child
Im not afraid, Im running wild
For everything that will be done
I am yours and you are my
Deliverer

The One, the One who carries us
God, Youre my deliverer
The One, the One who carries us
Oh God, Youre my deliverer
The One, the One who carries us
Oh God, Youre my deliverer
The One, the One who carries us
God, Youre my deliverer

I was hanging by threads of dust and bone---
