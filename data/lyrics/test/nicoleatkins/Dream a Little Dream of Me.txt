Stars shining so bright above you
Stars shinin' seem to whisper I love you
Birds singin' in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me.

Say nighty night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me.

Stars fadin' but I linger on, dear
still craving your kiss.
I'm longin' to linger till dawn, dear
Just sayin' this:

Sweet dreams until the daylight finds you
Sweet dreams to leave all your troubles far behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they may be
Dream a little dream of me.

(*whistle*)

Stars fadin' but I linger on, dear
Still cravin' your kiss.
I'm longin' to linger till dawn, dear
Just sayin' this:

Sweet dreams until the daylight finds you
Sweet dreams to leave all your troubles far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they may be
Dream a little dream of me.

da, da, da, da, da, da......
