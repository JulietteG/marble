i keep yo picture beside my bed
and i still remember everything you said
i always thought our love was so right 
i guess i was wrong
always thought youd be by my side papa
now youre gone( im not tryin to hear tht shit)

what i wanna know baby
if what we had was good
how come you dont call me
anymore

still light the fireon a rainy night
still like it better with you holdinme tight
everybody said everybody said
they wishin that well part 
tell me baby baby baby why u wanna go and break my heart

all i want to know is baby 
if what we had was good
how come you dont call me
call me any more

why u playin
sometimes it feels like 
im gonna die 
if you dont call me papa 
ooo you got to try 
gone get down on my knees 
oh baby please please
come home 
ooooo
 wont you call me sometime papa 

why on earth cant you just pick up the phone 
u know i dont like to be alone
sing it

how come u dont call me

all i wanna know is baby 
if what we had was good 
how come you dont call me any more---Lyrics submitted by Devon.
