When the wind is blowing in your face
Sometimes in life you don't see straight
(Pray to him he will show)
When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you safe
(Stand strong and you will know)

(Chorus)
Ooooooh wait til you see my smile
Ooooooh wait til they see your smile

Don't they love to see you down
Kick you while your on the ground
(Don't let emotion show)
People always make you late
Don't let it get in your way
(See they say things they don't know)
Sing

Chorus

So your doing better now
Everybody comes around
You don't really need them
Cuz your stronger and your better and your ready for whatever
Sing
