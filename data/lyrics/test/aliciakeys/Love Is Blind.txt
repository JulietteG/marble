Well people dont see, what i see. 
Even when they're right there, standing next to me. 
And all of my friends think im crazy for loving you.. 
What they dont know, is there's nothing else i can do. 

Its too bad coz love is blind.. 
Its too bad, its too bad. 
Its too bad, so bad. 
Its too bad coz love is blind. 
Its too bad it dont matter baby. 
Its too bad coz love is blind. 
Its too bad, so sad. 
Its too bad coz love is blind.

See people dont know, what i know.
They say im losing my mind. 
I know im losing control. 
All of my friends think im crazy but I dont care. 
Im over the edge, no more turning back.
Belong to you i swear.

Its too bad coz love is blind.
Its too bad, its too bad. 
Its too bad, so bad. 
Its too bad coz love is blind. 
Its too bad it dont matter baby. 
Its too bad coz love is blind. 
Its too bad, so sad. 
Its too bad coz love is blind. x2---Lyrics submitted by Karabo.
