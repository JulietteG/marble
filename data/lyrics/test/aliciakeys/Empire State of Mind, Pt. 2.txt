Oh, New York
Oh, New York

Grew up in a town
That is famous as a place
Of movie scenes

Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean

If I can make it here
I can make it anywhere
That's what they say

Seeing my face in lights
Or my name on marquees
Found down on Broadway

Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from

New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York

These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York
New York, New York

On the avenue
There ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard

Such a melting pot
On the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to god

Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem
To the Brooklyn bridge

Someone sleeps tonight
With a hunger for more than
An empty fridge

Imma make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from

New york
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York

These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York
New York, New York

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah

In New york
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York

These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York
New York, New York---
