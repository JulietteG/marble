Clap ya hands everybody, Uh clap ya hands
C'mon, keep it goin... Clap ya hands everybody, clap ya hands everybody
Clap ya... Let's do it, you ready? C'mon! 
We could fight like Ike and Tina or get back like Bill and Camelle
Be rich like Oprah, N Stedman or instead struggle like Flow N James Evens
Cuz he! ain't no different from you n she! ain't no different from me
So we! got to live out our dreams
Like the people on TV we gotta stay tuned cuz there's more to see 
Unbreakable!
Through the technical difficulties
Unbreakable!
We might have to take a break
But ya'll know we'll be back next week
I'm say'n this love is unbreakable...(oooh yeaa, yeaa)
Yea, clap ya hands everybody, clap ya hands everybody
Let's do it like this C'mon
See we could act out like Will and Jada (Will N Jada)
Or like Kimora N Russell make'n paper (oh yea)
All in the family! Like the Jacksons (Like the Jacksons)
And have enough kids to make a band like Joe and Catherine (yeeaa)
She! ain't no different from me n he! ain't no different from you
So we! got to live out our dreams
Like the people on TV we gotta stay tuned cuz there's more to see
Unbreakable!
Through the technical difficulties
Unbreakable!
We might have to take a break 
But ya'll know we'll be back next week
I'm say'n this love is unbreakable (We livin' our dreams)
We livin' our dreams! we liven our dreams,
