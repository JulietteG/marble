Girl, you could never, never...

She want to live in my home,
She want my money...
She want I to take her,
to all the pretty places...
When I talk about love,
She just laugh at me...
When I try to make love,
She wouldn't scratch at me...

Woman, don't try to use me...
I'm a man, yeah,
So don't try to use me...

The first time my mommy saw her,
She took her in her arms and said to me...
Son this girl mature...
My brothers and mys sisters,
All said the same,
They let her looks hold her down...

Woman, don't try to use me...
I'm a man, yeah,
So don't try to use me...

Girl, yeah,
Don't try to use me...
Yeah...
Oooh...
Don't, don't don't....
Ooooo...
I'm a man, yeah...

Woman, don't try to use me...
I'm a man, yeah,
So don't try to use me...

The first time my mommy saw her,
She took her in her arms and said to me...
Son this girl mature...
My brothers and mys sisters,
All said the same,
They let her looks hold her down...

Woman, don't try to use me...
I'm a man, yeah,
So don't try to use me...

Girl...
