Why keep me hangin' on a string ring a ding a ding
Everybody knows but you I wish you'd understand
Don't keep me in promised land
Why can't you be true are they all like you

Why pretend you're a lotta lie trappin' every guy
Or any man that falls for you why can't you understand
A fellow's in wonderland when love is so new are they all like you

You know you may think you're bein' smart
Breakin' some foolish heart but you can't fool me
What you've never had you've never missed
And I've not been kissed by you

Why keep me danglin' on a string ring a ding a ding
Playin' hard to get's not new wish I could understand 
What makes you so underhand
When I love you so true are they all like you

You know you may think you're bein' smart
Breakin' some foolish heart but you can't fool me
What you've never had you've never missed
And I've not been kissed by you

Why keep me danglin' on a string ring a ding a ding
Playin' hard to get's not new wish I could understand 
What makes you so underhand 
Why can't you be true when love is so new
When I love you so true are they all like you.---Lyrics submitted by Glsz Mihly.
