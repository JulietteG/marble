Spreading your love from the tip of a sword 
Echoing the reason that poisons your 
Thinking you know what's good for us all 
I wish I could reach out... 

To silence you 

But I'm a waste in your eyes. 
You say you don't need me to save you tonight. 
But I need to save you tonight. 

I'm standing alone on the brink of a stone 
Trying to humanise the enemy inside you 
We're cut from the same cloth but we are 
Stained with the poison of pride 

We're sucking the life from the whole of the world 
Can't be confined or condemned to be 
Reduced to a place that's a violent resolve 
To the end they will try 

And silence you. 

Cos we're a waste in their eyes 
The grace they describe 
Won't save you tonight. 

Spreading your love from the tip of a sword 
Echoing your reason that poisons your 
Of all your fear, love, anymore?? 
Let pride come before a fall 

I wish you could see and leave for something more 
Than the things I'm confined and condemned to be 
They will know our needs and we won't be ignored 
So that we may excuse our lives 

Don't let them silence you 
Cos you're a waste in their eyes 
There's a grace inside of you... 
I need tonight...---Lyrics submitted by nandi.
