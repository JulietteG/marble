Oh, my teeth are crumbling from out my face
And my legs are breaking more everyday
And this weight is weighed on my back
And I won't let it break no how no way

I am trying, I am trying x4

_Chorus_
Baby you gotta bleed to heal
Baby you gotta bleed to heal
Tell me how am I suppose to feel?
Baby you gotta bleed to heal

Life gets turned into business
___ on the twelve days of Christmas
All this weight is weighed upon my back
Someone has got to save the state of change

I am trying, I am trying x4

Chorus

It ain't about me no matter how it seems
This ain't about me no matter how it seems
They can keep their checks
I'll still feel flawless
As long as everyone in front of me is happy.

Chorus---
