            Once was lost, but now I'm found.
            So far away, but I'm home now,
            I once was lost but now I'm found.
            And now my lifesong sings.
            I once was blind, but now I see.
           Once was blind, but now Isee.
           I don't know how, but when he touched me,
           I once was blind, but now I see.
           And now my lifesong sings.(2x)
