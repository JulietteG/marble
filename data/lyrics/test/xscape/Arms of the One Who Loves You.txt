verse 1: i know you're going
i cant make you stay
i can only let you know i love you anyway
and if the road you take leads to heartbreak 
somewhere down the line
if someone ever hurts you
or treats your heart unkind

chorus: you just run to the arms
of the one who loves you
you just run to these arms
and these two arms will keep you warm
when rain has failed your heart
never fear, im never far
you just run to the arms of the one who loves you

verse 2: i want you happy
i want the best for you
and if you have to leave to find your dream
i hope that dream comes true
but if the world you find
brings you hard times
if someone makes you cry
i'll be there to hold you
i'll be standing by

chorus: you just run to the arms (aww baby)
of the one who (you never have to worry) loves you
you just run to these arms
and these two arms will keep you warm (they will keep you warm)
when rain has failed your heart (ooooh yes)
never fear (never never fear oh babe), im never far
you just run to arms of the one who loves you

(ooooh) my love is strong enough you know
strong enough to let you go
but i'll always hold you inside my heart
and if you should ever change your mind
you can come back anytime
and when you do (and when you do)

chorus: (you just) you just run to the arms
of the one who (you never have to worry) loves you
(naw baby) just run to these arms 
and these two arms will keep you warm
when rain has failed your heart (yeah)
never fear, im never far---Lyrics submitted by Amyre.
