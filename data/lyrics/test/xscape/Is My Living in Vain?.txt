Verse:
Is my living in vain
Is my giving in vain
Is my singing in vain
Is my praying in vain

Chorus:
No 
Of course not!
It's not all in vain
Cause up the road is eternal gain

Verse:
Am I wasting my time
Can the clock be rewind
Have I let my life shine
Have I made ninety-nine

Chorus:
No 
Of course not 
It's not all in vain 
Cause up the road is eternal gain---Lyrics submitted by Stacey.
