Don't come to leave if its all 
for a moment 
love makes its own time 
don't come around 

Don't tear your heart out 
leave it open 
Its in your soul boy 
to make me high 
If you should find yourself 
lost in love 
and you've still got time 
and you still want me 

Then let me ease your fears 
with love 
ooh ooh 
with a love that makes us reel 

Don't come to leave 
and don't come around 
don't come to leave  
If its all for one day 

If you still want me 
and you've still got time 
don't stay away, no 
don't stay away.  

Love has its moments 
and oh for a moment 
don't come to leave me 
and don't leave so soon 

Don't tear your heart out 
leave it open 
its in your soul boy 
to make me high 

If you could see yourself 
lost in love 
and you've still got time 
and you still want me. 

then let me ease your fears 
with love 
ooh ooh 
with a love that makes us reel.
