Love's your voodoo baby 
it colours your mellow instinct 
it brings out all your senses 
and shows up all your feelings 
I love your voodoo soul boy. 

Colour your mellow instincts 
and free your inner senses 
free, free your inner self, 
your innocence 

and lets watch the minutes fly, 
the minutes fly by by 
Oh how the minutes fly 
with your 
voodoo soul 
voodoo soul 
voodoo soul 

I love your voodoo soul boy 
I love to watch you dreaming 
It shows up all your secrets 
It tells me how you're feeling 
I love your voodoo soul boy. 

Colour your mellow instincts 
and free your inner senses 
free, free your inner self, 
your innocence 

and lets watch the minutes fly, 
the minutes fly by by 
Oh how the minutes fly 
with your 
voodoo soul 
voodoo soul 
voodoo soul.---Lyrics submitted by --.
