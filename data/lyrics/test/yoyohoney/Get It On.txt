Say it 

There'll come a time in time 
when I'll be, so free on you 
There'll come a time in time 
when I'll be, so free on you 
you make my mind go undersway 
you make my eyes go undersway 

and if you say you love me, say it 
and if you say you want me, say it say it 
and if you say you'll have me, 
I'll get it on, get it on. 

There'll come a time in time 
when I'll kiss those fragile eyes 
and if you use those fragile eyes 
I'll be, so free on you 
God you're mine, 
you send my mind undersway 
you make my eyes go undersway 

and if you say you love me, say it 
and if you say you want me, say it say it 
and if you say you'll have me 
I'll get it on, get it on. 

I will, till the blood drips from my veins 
get it on, get it on.
