I am so so soft on you 
maybe I could, dry those intimate eyes 
I am so so softy on you 
fridays on me, fridays on me 
come friday my lips will be yours 

I am so so stuck on you 
maybe you could be my superboy 
you've got these sunset lips like sunset 
dry those childish eyes 

and give all of your love 
I will give all of my love 
fridays on me, fridays on you 
come friday, my lips will be yours 

I am so so soft on you 
I am so so soft on you.
