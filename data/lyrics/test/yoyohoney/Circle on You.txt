Come into my eyes baby 
let me see you purely 
Come into my eyes baby 
let me see you clearly 
the godless things I'd love to do 
with affection 
for your unresisting love 

Ooh yeah 
Ooh yeah 
and draw a circle on you. 

Come into my eyes baby 
let me see you purely 
Come into my eyes 
let me see you clearly 
my natural whirl is a going high 
with affection 
for your unresisting love 

Ooh yeah 
Ooh yeah 
Going to draw a circle on you.
