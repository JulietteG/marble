13 Months of Sunshine
Is what we got

Take us to, take us to , take us to that land

Who shall ascend the hill
Stand in that holy place
Lift up your heads
O ancient gates

13 Months of Sunshine
Is what she got

Forward to , Forward to , Forward to that land

Where the water run (free)
We want to be
Earth gives food
Feeds you and me
Amharic chant

Forward to that land

Now the sun is in my eyes
Well I say
I am feeling high

Take us to that land
Forward to that land

13 Months of Sunshine---
