I like to play
I like to
I like to play, play
I like to play
I like to play, play
I like to play
I like to play, play
I like to play, play
I like to play, play
I like to play, play
I like to play, play
I like to play

I play all day long in my room
I play all day long in my room
I like to play---Lyrics submitted by Andrea.
