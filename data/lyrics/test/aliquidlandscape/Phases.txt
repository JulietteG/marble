Tonight, I lean across a million miles in solitude
Patiently I rested for a while on the pavement to see a miracle

I was swiftly taken by surprise as it finally occurred to me
That somehow the phase that I'm in made the rivers bleed
It's a miracle, a miracle, a miracle

And now these rivers bleed, I'm not for sure she bleeds for me
I lean back so confident but this is where it ends tonight,
on this riverbed

Curiosity led the way, yeah curiosity
And now these rivers bleed, I'm not for sure she bleeds for me
I lean back so confident but this is where it ends tonight,
on this riverbed---Lyrics submitted by Lonneke.
