My heart has lost its wind now
Broken like a dead sail
My love has drifted out to sea

My body has been claimed
Soul has been shipped away
Can't feel the sand between my toes

We set the wrong course and headed due north
That's where we went wrong
We were young and learning steady hearts hate turning
That's where we went wrong

My will to fight has been flushed
Seized like blank babies faces
The water line begins to rise

Let the tide swallow me whole
Like morning light in windows
Let that dark water take me home

We set the wrong course and headed due north
That's where we went wrong
We were young and learning steady hearts hate turning
That's where we went wrong

[Greta:] Hey come back to me
[Darren:] Hey come back to me
[Greta:] Hey come back to me
[Darren:] Baby come back to me
[Chris:] (ba ba da ba ba ba)

We set the wrong course and headed due north
That's where we went wrong
We were young and learning steady hearts hate turning
That's where we went wrong---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlin.
