i've got, a new friend
she's hanging on my wall
she's not like the others
she's the fairest of them all

when the world it brings me down
and life don't go my way
i'm thinking i should end it all
but i got a new solution
i got a new solution

i'm gonna pick up some beer,
and stay at home
and stare at my clare danes poster

sometimes, my stomach hutrs
early in the day
but one look, in her direction
and the pain just goes away

when i toss and turn at night 
and i can't go to sleep
there's too much shit swimming in m head
but i got a new solution
i got a new solution

i'm gonna pick up some beer
stay at home
stare at my clare danes poster
she looks so bitchin'
she always listens
she never tells me a loser
im a loser

she is so beautiful
and she always understands
that every once in while
i pretend she's my hand

i'm gonna pick up some beer
stay at home
stare at my clare danes poster
she looks so bitchin'
she always listens
she never tells me a loser, loser

pick up some beer
stay at home
stare at my clare danes poster
she looks so bitchin'
she always listens
she never tells me a loser, loser
loser, loser
loser, loser
loser, loser---Lyrics submitted by Ella.
