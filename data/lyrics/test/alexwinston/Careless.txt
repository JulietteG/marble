So give me a hint up on the floor
I need to feel not much more
I want to be careless
Wanted to be careless

Give it to me
I'm down on the floor
Make me believe
This can be more
I want to be careless
Wanted to be careless with you
Careless with you

It's not my business
But he could reach it
None I'll ever see
But that don't make no difference
'Cause in this instance
I'm not losing sleep
And so high as I hear myself snore before
I try to hide
Maybe I did it all wrong
It'd be so wrong
It's been so long, oh

So give me a hint up on the floor
I need to feel not much more
I want to be careless
Wanted to be careless

Give it to me
I'm down on the floor
Make me believe
This can be more
I want to be careless
Wanted to be careless with you
Careless with you---
