I guess you never knew Dear Boy
What you had found
I guess you never knew Dear Boy
That she was just the cutest thing around
I guess you never knew what you had found Dear Boy

I guess you never saw Dear Boy
That love was there
Believe me when you look too hard Dear Boy
You never do become aware
I guess you never did become aware Dear Boy

When I stepped in
My heart was down and out
But a love came through
That brought me around
Got me up and about

f-doo f-doo f-doo f-doo Dear Boy doo doo doo doo 
f-doo f-doo f-doo  Dear Boy Dear Boy na na na na na na na
doo doo doo doo doo Dear Boy

When I stepped in
My heart was down and out
But a love came through
That brought me around
Got me up and about

I hope you never know Dear Boy
How much you missed
And even when you fall in love Dear Boy 
It wont be half as good as this
I hope you never know how much you missed Dear Boy
How much you missed, yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Chris Wilbur.
