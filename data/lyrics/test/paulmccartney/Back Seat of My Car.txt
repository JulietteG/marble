Speedin along the highway
Honey I want it my way
But listen to her daddys song
Dont stay out too long

Ooh were just busy hidin
Sittin in the back seat of my car

The lazy lights are pretty
We may end up in Mexico City
But listen to her daddys song
Making love is wrong

Ooh were just busy ridin
Sittin in the back seat of my car

Oh we was only hidin
Sittin in the back seat of my car

Now when were finished drivin
We can say we were late in arriving
And listen to her daddys song
We believe that we cant be wrong

Ohh We believe that we cant be wrong
Ohh We believe that we cant be wrong
We can make it to Mexico City
Sittin in the back seat of my car

Ohh We believe that we cant be wrong
Ohh We believe that we cant be wrong
Ohh We believe that we cant be wrong
Ohh We believe that we cant be wrong
Ohh We believe that we cant be wrong
Ohh We believe that we cant be wrong
No No No!

Waaaaah We believe that we cant be wrong
Yeah Yeah Yeah!

Oooh, ah na na na na na na na na na nah---Lyrics submitted by Chris Wilbur.
