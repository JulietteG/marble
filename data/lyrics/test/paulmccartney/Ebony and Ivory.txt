Ebony and Ivory live together in perfect, harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh lord why dont we.

We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad, in everyone

Learn to live, learn to give each other, what we need to survive
Together alive.

Ebony and Ivory live together in perfect, harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh lord why dont we.

(Ebony and Ivory living in perfect, harmony  Ebony and Ivory)

We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad, in everyone

Learn to live,we  learn to give each other, what we need to survive
Together alive.

Ebony and Ivory live together in perfect, harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh lord why dont we.
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh lord why dont we.

(Ebony and Ivory living in perfect, harmony, Ebony and Ivory living in perfect, harmony..  )---Lyrics submitted by Mike.
