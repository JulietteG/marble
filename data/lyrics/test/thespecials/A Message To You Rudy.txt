Stop your messing around
Better think of your future
Time you straighten right out
Creating problems in town

Rudy, a message to you
Rudy, a message to you

Stop your fooling around
Time you straighten right out
Better think of your future
Else youll wind up in jail

Rudy, a message to you
Rudy, a message to you

Stop your messing around
Better think of your future
Time you straighten right out
Creating problems in town

Rudy, a message to you
Rudy, a message to you
Rudy, oh, its a message to you
Rudy, yeah, its a message to you
Rudy, oh, its a message to you
Rudy, oh, its a message to you
Rudy, yeah, its a message to you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
