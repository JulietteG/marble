In an airplane
I take the window seat
A thousand feet, and all i know shrinks in minutes
When the sky is gray
I want to believe
That when the sun is hiding it still exists

Mountain tops peak through
This is where I see you
I've never seen a clearer blue
This is where I see you

In an airplane
Are kings and common men 
At the window side by side 
Their view is now the same

Mountain tops peak through
This is where I see you
I've never seen a clearer blue
This is where i see you

Leave behind your busy life
All you have is who you are
Space like this is hard to find, so breathe it in
Someone will sayd, "where are you heading?"
And it might be th first time you ever thought about it

Mountain tops peak through
This is where i see you
I've never seen a clearer blue
This is where i see you

A baby's talking 2 rows behing d me
The sun just set fro the second time today
You seem to use the smallest things around me
To get me to this place

Moutain tops peak through 
This is where I see you
I've never seen a clearer blue
This is where I see you

Mountain tops peak through 
This is where I see you
I've never seen a clearer blue
This is where I see you---Lyrics submitted by Faith.
