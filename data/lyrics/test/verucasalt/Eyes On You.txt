Im falling awake at daybreak
and Ive got my eyes on you
Im playing it back the heart attack
that opened my eyes to you

Wait, dont grow up yet
Cause its late
Were wired and underslept
I can trace arrows and evidence back
to you

Rewinding again to the moment
when I lost the lives to you
Youre holding my gaze
Id rearrange the clouds in the skies
for you

Wait, dont grow up yet
Cause its late
Weve gotta stay up for the end
I can trace arrows and evidence back
to you

Out under the stars I hear you say
I am your sun and youre my shade
Hey
Hopscotch in the driveway after dark
These are the thorns and these are shards
Float on the hops

Im falling awake at day break
and Ive got my eyes on you

Wait, dont grow up yet
Cause its late
I'm wired and underslept
I can make sense of the secrets left
I can trace arrows and evidence
And we hide all the letters sent
And we drive reckless and radiant
And we lied---
