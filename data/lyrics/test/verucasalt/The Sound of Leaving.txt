Im awake and youre asleep
Brick house is breathing, breathing
Lying in the castle deep
Sink down, Im dreaming, dreaming
Skin cold against the sheets
Deep south is freezing, freezing
Im freezing

Hold onto me
Its the sound of leaving
Hold onto me
Thats the sound of leaving

Slip out into the stars
Smoke saddle in your pocket
Suitcase is in your car
You dont stop, you just cant stop it
Someday, somehow
Youll remember when you lost it
The day you lost it

Hold onto me
Its the sound of leaving, leaving
Hold onto me
Its the sound of leaving, leaving
Thats the sound

Pinned down against your will
Feel the planets rearranging
I lie here very still
The tiny whispers, the shiny whispers
Oh no, oh wow
The earth beneath our feet is shaking
And now youre breaking

Hold onto me
Thats the sound of leaving
Thats the sound---
