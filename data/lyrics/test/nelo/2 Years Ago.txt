It was about two years ago
That I sang my fist note
I was a feeler and a dancer of the rain
I stood up and played along
And I sang my first song
I was a dreamer in my heart that I blamed

I was swimming in the deep, oh
Swimming, oh, inside the sound
And the rain, yeah it's coming down

Now the pain I can resist
It's a hidden type of kiss
It's a pain that sort of rations me in  way
There was a train I tried to miss
But I wouldn't seem to stick
I had a fire in my boots to move around

I was swimming in the deep, oh
Swimming, oh, inside the sound
And the rain, yeah it's still coming down

When I scream at the devil, 
Oh he takes a different face
And when I sing to the angels,
Oh, they look at me in shame
I said this is how a man has to be...
On his knees

It was about two years ago
That I stood inside your door
 I said, "Pack your things, we're going for a ride"
You looked up into my eyes 
And it came as no surprise
There's a laughter that's still running through my face

I was swimming in the deep, oh
Swimming, oh, inside the sound
And the rain, yeah it's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down
Yeah it's coming down
