How many times alone Ive felt that Im not okay- Im not okay
Without the thought of all my friends and a love- I know a loves embrace
For all the times I tried to see what was chasing me and holding me down
I count the nights stood sleeplessly, as the ceiling caught me staring

Im waking up with one eye open to keep my dreams inside of me
And I, I do it so I might believe that theres some escape to what I see
I catch a phrase to ease the pain, but it seems Im still untying 
I feel the age surround me now in this place Ive felt a love somehow

And wont you please come and stay a while?
Wont you please relate?
And wont you please come and lift me up?
Wont you please, today?

Troubled thoughts a given sign from the lovers eyes that clouded mine
Im finding broken thoughts tonight on the way I want to feel alive
I tried to say the blame should be on the man I see who isnt me
But now Ive come to find only that this is me unraveling

And wont you please come and stay a while?
Wont you please relate?
And wont you please come and lift me up?
Wont you please, today?
And wont you please come and stay a while?
Wont you please relate?
And wont you please come and lift me up?
Wont you please, today?

Please
Oh, Please---Lyrics submitted by jay.
