Well, Id know what to do if I could keep from pacing
Well show it all to you and make it right in me
I guess were almost through, you know just what Im saying
Weve echoed through to you, youre gonna love this too 
Oh yeah, you already do

Oh, my baby, theres a light outside
 I must be crazy to be wasting time
And if I could be wrong- well, are you alright?
Ill go running tonight

Intention makes here all my life- oh
Divided thoughts today wont dance away the brave
Were gonna bathe in you until you just cant stand it
 And I should say the day will come my thoughts will fall away
Yeah, oh they fall away today, yeah

Oh, my baby, theres a light outside
Theres a light outside
 I must be crazy to be wasting time
And if I could be wrong- well, are you alright?
Ill go running tonight

Oh yeah, and so weve come to play- a dream of peace, well push it through
Id like to keep it there I know you know Ive prayed for you
And all weve come to know, well its thrown all away
So seek a bigger heart to make this stay---Lyrics submitted by jay.
