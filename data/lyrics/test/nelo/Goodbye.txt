Well, Ive been missing the call stuck in these city walls
Its gonna be a while for this to straighten out
Everythings wrong with this city today
Doors are all broken in- houses are caving in
How can these people live with nothing left to give?
I can be sure theres plenty of pain
Oh yeah, the wind stopped- the wind, it brought the rain

Oh, somethings over me
Yeah, when I am on my knees

People were sitting there smiling up at the air
Laughing so easily- stuck in their memory
Blowing their kisses of love away
She was a little girl when she woke up the world
(She) Danced down this lovers street without the eyes to see
All of the crazy colors it brings
Oh yeah, the sky fell and covered everything

Oh, somethings over me
Yeah, when I am on my knees

Oh, I can be anything I dream
And oh, my love, theres this opportunity 
And oh, I can get over this thing
This is what I know of me

Well, this is where I begin- back on my feet again
Lessons I learned are gone- you wont be waiting long
I fell in love with this city today
Yeah, the wind stopped- the wind, it brought the rain
Oh yeah, the wind stopped- the wind, it brought the rain

Oh, somethings caught a little bit of my time
And oh, something dropped a little bit of sunshine
Yeah, yeah, yeah Goodbye

Oh yeah goodbye
Oh yeah, goodbye---Lyrics submitted by jay.
