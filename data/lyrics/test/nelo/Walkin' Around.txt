Tick-tock as the clock goes round 
Well, its staring at you- could you figure it out?
Oh, I know that the seasons change
Oh, so why do I seem to feel the same?
I got up and I walked into town
The sun was shining on the frozen ground
 Well Id like to stay and play a while
But my legs are moving- I wont even try

Im taking a walk in my own rain
Youre taking a walk down wind
I thought you could look back the other way 
Or turn right back around

I look up and I look back down 
I see a funny little man who spins the world around
Well, hes three feet tall with a stick in his hand
When he smiles he laughs: It was part of the plan
I walk up to where the grass is green
A little bird tells me all about just what hes seen 
Well, he flies away singing a song
When a voice calls me before I move along 

It says:
Im taking a walk in my own rain
Youre taking a walk down wind
I thought you could look back the other way 
Or turn right back around
Turn right back around- yeah

Well, I was thinking that I would touch the sky
And spread the sunshine all around
I can open up these clouds 
Oh- Ive been crazy for a couple days
But with the sunshine all around
I feel open to a new kind of day

Well, Ive been working on a little thing
And if it grows, it might grow and whisk the world away
But Ill keep on walking up and down this street
And Ill wait for the man to step in front of me, yeah

Im taking a walk in my own rain
Youre taking a walk down wind
I thought you could look back the other way 
Or turn right back around
Well, Im taking a walk in my own rain
Youre taking a walk down wind
I thought you could at least look the other way 
Or turn right back around
Turn right back around, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, how could I forget that day?
Oh, how could forget that day?
Oh, how could I forget that day?
When we went walking around
And how could I forget that day?
Oh, how could I forget that day?
Oh, how could I forget that day?
When we went walking, we went walkin around---Lyrics submitted by jay.
