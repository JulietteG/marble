Oh, when the ribbon ties I cant deny- I could be saved by you
And from a stolen glance, a second chance is making all the love come through
And if I need a little speed, a little bit of love wont do
What I mean to say is that its all gone to nothing with you

So this volcanos blowing up and you look like someone else
The heat can drain here from this cup inside me, the cup behind the walls

Its all gone to nothing, and its all gone to nothing, and its all gone to nothing with you
And its all gone to nothing, and its all gone to nothing, and its all gone to nothing with you

Well, Im taking back the photographs, the pieces of me, and you
Because I want to try and recognize things from an alternate view
And when Im sitting down Ill hear the sound, Ill hear the man carry his tune
Well, its not hard to tell that its all gone to nothing with you

So this volcanos blowing up and you look like someone else
The heat can drain here from this cup inside me, the cup behind the walls
You mixed the colors in my head- you turned them right around
And Ill paint a picture here instead- Im dancing and you are dying out

So this volcanos blowing up and you look like someone else
The heat can drain here from this cup inside me, the cup behind the walls
You mixed the colors in my head- you turned them right around
And Ill paint a picture here instead- Im dancing and you are dying out

Hey, hey its gone- I can sit and watch the days move on
Hey its gone- I can sit and watch the days move on
Oh I say- I can sit and watch the days away
Yeah its on- its not the same with the smiling faces gone---Lyrics submitted by jay.
