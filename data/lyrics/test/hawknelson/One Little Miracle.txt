I know sometimes it's hard to find the strength to turn the page
When all of our tomorrows look like views from yesterday
Maybe this path we're taking, could really be the road to breaking free
Are you with me?

One little revolution could turn it all around
Back to the kingdom we once knew
Just a little bit of me, just a little bit of you
One little miracle to get us through

Broken, empty promises are all we knew before
Our father's dreams of better days lay shattered on the floor
It's not too late to start believing
Take me by the hand that's reaching out
How about now?

One little revolution could turn it all around
Back to the kingdom we once knew
Just a little bit of me, just a little bit of you
One little miracle to get us through

We can right the wrongs
From this moment on

One little revolution could turn it all around
Back to the kingdom we once knew
With a little bit of me, and a little bit of you
One little miracle to get us through---Lyrics submitted by Abigail Winch.
