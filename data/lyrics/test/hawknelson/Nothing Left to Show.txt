Life is just a line-up tell me when my times up too much on my mind today 
there's so much left that i would like to say
When i start to climb up will you pull my line u or am i just in the way?
I think about it every single day I think about it every single day

Fix us 'cause we keep falling apart just keep falling apart we're tired of being alone
Fix me 'cause i keep falling apart just keep falling apart won't someone find me?

Life is just a line-up tell me when my times up too much on my mind today 
there's so much left that i would like to say
When i start to climb up will you pull my line u or am i just in the way?
I think about it every single day I think about it every single day

Fix us 'cause we keep falling apart just keep falling apart we're tired of being alone
Fix me 'cause i keep falling apart just keep falling apart won't someone find me?

Now i feel like somethings going on(13 times)

Fix us 'cause we keep falling apart just keep falling apart we're tired of being alone
Fix me 'cause i keep falling apart just keep falling apart won't someone find me?---Lyrics submitted by angel.
