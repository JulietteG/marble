will some one please radio for help
'cause i think im allergic to myself
and they think they can throw us all away
we gotta stop it before its all to late

(chorus)
there's got to be a better way
they dissect everything we say
to make us try to feel this way

well you can take the one thing i have left
and give it all away for so much less
you can even take the heart inside my chest 
woah-woah

and you can take the one thing i have left
beat me to the ground and take my breath
but you cant take who i am
woah-woah

and i swear we we're born to let you down
we scream but never make a sound
we point but dont no which direction
we are america right now

(chorus)
there's got to be a better way
they dissect everything we say
to make us try to feel this way

well you can take the one thing i have left
and give it all away for so much less
you can even take the heart inside my chest 
whoa-whoa

well you can take the one thing i have left
beat me to the ground and take my breath
but you cant take who i am
whoa-whoa

and how can i be
(the same)
how can i say
(the blame)
how come i am, - so -tired- of -all- these- char-ades
how can i be
(the one)
how can i hold
(the gun)

how can i see if everyone else is to blame
Hey! dont wanna be the
don't wanna see the 
we point the finger but everyone else is to blame
BLAME!
everyone else is to blame!
hey! hey! dont wanna see the hey! hey!
'cause we point the finger
think everyone else is to blame
blame
everyone else is to blame---Lyrics submitted by Michalie.
