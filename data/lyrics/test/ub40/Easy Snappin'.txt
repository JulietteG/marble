Astro Rap: 
Easy snappin is 1,2,3
everybody round come a bother me (X2)
see the girl bangels passing and move
see the girl bangels passing and groove

camel of the union always endlessly
everybody knows we were meant to be 
camel of the union always endlessly

Lets get together make sweet harmony X2
cause we'll be stopping for eternity

When we walk down the street you break guys hearts in two (with)
everything you say and everything you do
