Last night I was picturing you with him, 
(Fall) down and just lay on the floor
I knew you were in decent and later I, 
Got up and then just walked out the door
I tried to make it easy by walking out,
 but your eyes and I cant take anymore
Just talk there is no reason for you to sulk
Cant change the images that I saw

You see with me
Ohh I, you are
But with you, you
But with you, you steer

So (tall) how disapproving youve made your claim
No faith and yet you act so naive
I loathe the way you turn this it out to blame
Walk out I'm busting you from my sleep
Times up I'm disappearing, Im leaving here
Fed up but theres no way to complain
At first it was so sexy but now its strange
And youre voice whos more than drive me insane.

You see with me
Ohh I, you are
But with you, you
But with you, you steer

You see with me
Ohh I, you are
But with you, you
But with you, you steer

I know its true, I cant keep feeling like I do
I'm not so (boo)
I wont keep feeling like I do

I tried to break my heart
I'm dying to tell you how, I 
I have seen where you go at night
Its not right, no!

You see with me
Ohh I, you are
But with you, you
But with you, you steer

You see with me
Ohh I, you are
But with you, you
But with you.. you steer---Lyrics submitted by Riccardo Alberto Muia.
