Im lookin for the one;
a path into the hills;
another setting sun;
the power without the will.

And we can fall into the new ocean

Make ready, all the boats.
The valleys filling up.
Lets lower down the ropes
and let our brothers in.

And we can fall into the new ocean.
With all you do are you already sunk?

Here we come,
Here we come,
Here we come

Tied a ribbon around the star
so it wont forget my wish
to never be so far.
Give my body to the fish so they dont starve.

And we can fall into the new ocean;
and where are you, my darling born? 

Here we come
Here we come
Here we come

Here we come
Here we come---Lyrics submitted by Will H..
