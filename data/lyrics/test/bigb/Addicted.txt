I'm waking up in the middle of the night, 
You know it ain't right.
I got cold sweats,
Then when i feel it next,
I start to twitch.
& my body gets warm,
just thinking about the needle hitting my arm.
They say the after affects are permanent,
but i don't care.
I just need a fix, 
I just need a fix,
I just need a fix,
I just need a fix.

I'm addicted, I'm in love, i'm a fiend. 
I'm addicted, I'm in love, I'm a fiend.

It hurts so good,
I just wish I could, 
do it more and more.
You say I'm crazy,
can't understand,
what i do it for.
Its plain to see, it's changed me.
Now i got people judging me. 
I can't lie, i'm obsessed with the high.
I guess that's why.. 
I guess that's why..

I'm addicted, I'm in love, i'm a fiend. 
I'm addicted, I'm in love, I'm a fiend.
I'm addicted, I'm in love, I'm a fiend.
I'm addicted, I'm in love, I'm a fiend.

I remember when it all began. 
The first time the needle hit my skin.
& I've been chasing the feeling ever since then.
I couldn't quit if I wanted too.
Because I feel like I got so much more too do. 
So much more to do, 
So much more to do, 
So much more to do, 
So much more to do
So much more to do, 
So much more to do.

I'm addicted, I'm in love, I'm a fiend.
I'm addicted, I'm in love, i'm a fiend. 
I'm addicted, I'm in love, I'm a fiend.
