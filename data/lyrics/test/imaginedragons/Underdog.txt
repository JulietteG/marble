Early morning, take me over
Father father father, take me to the top
Oh oh oh oh
Early morning, wake me up
Father father father, this is not enough
Oh oh oh oh

Hey! That sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be, I love to be the underdog
Hey! That sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be, I love to be the underdog
Hey!
The underdog
Hey!
Im the underdog
Hey!

Early evening, settling down
Father father father, who am I to play?
Oh oh oh oh
Early evening, hush me over
Father father father, are we just the same?
Oh oh oh oh

Hey! That sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be, I love to be the underdog
Hey! That sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be, I love to be the underdog
Hey!
The underdog
Hey!
Im the underdog
Hey!

Living in the low life
Low life
Low life
Living in the low life
Low life
Low life
Living in the low life

Hey! That sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be, I love to be the underdog
Hey! That sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh I love to be, I love to be the underdog
Hey!
The underdog
Hey!
I love to be the underdog
Hey!
The underdog
Hey!
The underdog
Hey!
The underdog
The underdog
Hey!---Lyrics submitted by Christopher Redd.
