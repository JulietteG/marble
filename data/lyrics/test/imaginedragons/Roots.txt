Dont throw stones at me
Dont tell anybody
Trouble finds me
All the noise of this
Has made me lose my belief

Im going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Im going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Im going back to my roots

Had to lose my way
To know which road to take
Trouble found me
All I look forward
Washed away by a wave

Im going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Im going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Im going back to my roots

I know its gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me
I know its gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me

Im going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Im going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Im going back to my roots---
