If only for a second 
Let me have you 
Tell me all your secrets 
Let me know you 

Paint me all your pictures 
Hang them on my wall 
Show me all your colors 
Show me all 

Open up your eyes 
Open up your mind 
Fall in line with what youre meant to be

A fire burns into you 
Purifying all 
And what I saw was opulence 
And thats not for me

Only in summertime

Things will change with time
Only in summertime 

Only in summertime
Things will change with time
Only in summertime---
