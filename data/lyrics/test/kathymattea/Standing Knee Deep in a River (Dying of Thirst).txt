Friends I could count on,
I could count on one hand,
with a left-over finger or two.
I took 'em for granted;
let 'em all slip away.
Now where they are
I wish I knew.

(Chorus)
They roll by
just like water
and I guess we never learn.
We go through life
parched and empty,
standing knee deep in a river
and dyin' of thirst.

Sometimes I remember 
sweethearts I've known.
Some I've forgotten, I suppose.
One or two still linger
oh, and I wonder now,
why I ever let them go.

(Chorus)

So, the sidewalk is crowded.
The city goes by 
and I rush through another day.
And a world full of strangers
turn their eyes to me
and I just look the other way.

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Shelly.
