A tree for all these problems
They can't find you for the moment
Then for all past efforts
They're buried deep beneath 
Your heart and somewhere in your stomach

And hatred for all others
When awful people they surround you

Well, eh, they just like monsters
They come to feed on me
Giant little animals to feed

Though, to say we got much hope,
if I am lost it's only for a little while

A tree for all these problems
They can't find us for the moment
Then for all past effort
They're buried deep beneath
Our hearts and somewhere in our stomachs

And hatred for all others
When awful people they surround you

Well, eh, they just like monsters
They come to feed on us
Giant little animals for us

Though to say we got much hope
If i am lost it's only for a little while
Though to say we got much hope
If i am lost it's only for a little while
If i am lost it's only for a little while
If i am lost it's only for a little while...---Lyrics submitted by Fiona.
