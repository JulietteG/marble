Just the mentioning of (Just the mention of)
Such a simple phrase.
Are we passengers on (separated trains)
Separated trains?
Take the mask off (Take the mask of)
When you speak to me.
And I'm alright to go on (It's the little things)
It's the little things.

But anymore, you've become.
Ethereal to everyone.
To everyone.

I'm reeling in the wrong day getting behind [?]
Why didn't I think "what in the world? "
It really took a tall one to see it
Two to believe it
Three to just get in the way

All your life to think of (All your life think of),
What a mess you made.
Dig a hole in the ground (for your wedding ring)
For your wedding ring.
Rainmaker call (the Rainmaker call)
Throw your hammer down.
And everything that I know (Can't remember now)
Can't remember now.

Anymore, you've become.
Inherent of another one.
Another one.

I reeling in the wrong days, getting behind
Why didn't I think "what in the world? "
It really took a tall one to see it
Two to believe it.
Three to just get in the way.---Lyrics submitted by VictorDeathrage.
