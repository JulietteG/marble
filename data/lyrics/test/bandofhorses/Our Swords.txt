Out of the wall, sounds of banging 
is constant coming from your head.
And desperate the calls came then ringing 
from those want to ring your neck.
Your neck.

Open your mouth, sounds of breathing 
Foulness spilling from your face.
Best to be dim to the humbleing traffic 
Stomping off your name. 

Count on the smoke 
Falling off our swords tonight.

Chilling walk home down the portions
Of roads there leading straight to your place.
It looked like the tin can would swallow
kitchen pluggin up your space.

Count the smoke steping off 
Our toes tonight.

Count on the smoke steping off 
Our toes
Count on the smoke falling off 
our swords tonight.---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
