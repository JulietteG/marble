The working man's day, we, just piss it away
Leafs it out in the weather
Familiar he said, times two breeds contempt
Wash your hands of it forever
Violence, it ripped through the old dogwood fence
See the whole scene unravel
Drunk brother said he could reason with them

While they lied at night,they lied and died, while they lied
While they lied at night,they lied and died, while they lied

The picture was left on the front porch, 
well that's it,I love you, don't you ever think of me?
If my body hurts then to hell with my soul
We don't even know the difference
The dead folks in the clouds, for crying out loud

While they lied at night, they lied and died, while they lied
While they lied at night, they lied and died, while they lied

And why, did we live so long
long
long

[bridge]

The house, not the same since we left it that day
Old friends seem to wander
Our parents had cigarettes, wedding bands
While they lied at night, they lied and died, while they lied
While they lied at night, they lied and died, while they lied

And why, did we live so long
long
long

[bridge]

While they lied at night, they lied and died, while they lied
While they lied at night, they lied and died, while they lied
While they lied at night, they lied and died, while they lied
OOooooooh---
