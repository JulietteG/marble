I got you arrested because
Are you come or gone
I am about to set this off
The party is done
The wine is there to keep yourself
You got it wrong
So I brought you plenty thoughts
Words were at a loss
It's a good day to skip because
The party is gonna call
The wine there t keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all
The parents are enforcing the law
The wine is there to keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all
The parents are enforcing the law---Lyrics submitted by Erin.
