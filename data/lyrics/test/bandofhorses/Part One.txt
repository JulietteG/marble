The bottom the earth i have to fall
but you really caught me
you really caught me, dear
at the bottom where I'd fallen.

And slowly dear ask that you dance with me
here with the shades down
lights off.

When i didn't know you
and everything i do
done badly.

Now I'll love you always
even when i say
you distract me.

And sit out tonight in some strange place
if we have no friends here
well i had a few to begin with.

To wake next to you in the morning
and good morning to you.
how do you do?
hey, good morning to you!
more covers for you.
sleep soundly dear cause i have to go.

And I'll love you always.
when we leave this place
and drive back to Carolina
and down to Savannah and
stay.---Lyrics submitted by Nando.
