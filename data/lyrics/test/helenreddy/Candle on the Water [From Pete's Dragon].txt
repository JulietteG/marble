i'll be your candle on the water
my love for you will always burn
i know you're lost and drifting

but the clouds are lifting
don't give up you'll have somewhere to turn(somewhere to turn)

i'll be your candle on the water(aah)
till every wave is warm and bright
my soul is there beside you

let this candle guide you
soon you'll see a golden street of light

a cold and friendless tide has found you
don't let no stormy darkness pull you down

i'll paint a ray of hope around you
circling in the air

lighted by a prayer
yes by a prayer

i'll be your candle on the water
this flame inside of me will grow
(keep holding on)hold on you'll make it

here's my hand so take it
look for me reaching out to show
as sure as rivers flow(sure as they flow)

i'll never let you go(never let you go)
i'll never let you go(never let you go)
i'll never let...you go(i'll be your candle on the water)---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Alysse Cartmell.
