So long ago, I don't remember when,
That's when they say I lost my only friend.
Well, they say she died easy from a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees.

I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn.
The long broken arm of human loss.
Now, it always seemed such a waste.
She always had a pretty face.
I wondered how she'd hung around this place.

Come on, try a little, nothing is forever.
There's got to be something better than in the middle.
Me and Cinderella, we put it all together.
We can ride it home with one headlight.

She said, "It's cold."
It feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from the parade.
Well, there's got to be an opening 
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed.

I saw the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying, "All there's good, and nothingness is dead."
We'll run until she's out of breath.
She ran until there's nothing left.
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge.

This place is old.
It feels just like a beat up truck.
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn.
It smells of cheap wine, cigarettes.
This place is always such a mess.
Sometimes, I think I'd like to watch it burn.

I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else.
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I'm not the same.
And somewhere here in between
These city walls and dying dreams,
I think of death and it must be killing me.

Come on, try a little, nothing is forever.
There's got to be something better  than in the middle.
Me and Cinderella, we put it all together.
We can drive it home with one headlight.

With one headlight.
One headlight.
With one headlight.
With one headlight.
One headlight.---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
