You go for seconds and days
I live for moments to say
That I may never get a second chance
Don't throw it away
Living for dollars and dimes
They'll all diminish in time
Oh let that motion come and crash
Like a plane from the sky
It was a long ride down the east coast
In a city can't keep
Could you keep up on your feet
And I was struck down by the west coast
It was a quarter to three but it don't do sleep

Don't follow the freeway
Break the routine
Cuz everything is second to your dreams
If this is the green light
Take what you need
And break out of this hospital scene
I'm running through a stop sign
Countin up the quick lights
I don't want to slow slow slow slow down down
I'm running through a stop sign
Living so it feels right
I don't want to slow slow slow slow down down
Don't wanna slow it down

But I give impatience a try
Got a little enveloped in time
Cuz I watch you come and watch you go
And it don't seem right
Living for speed limit signs
Ignoring cross every line
Gotta let emotion take you over 20 miles at a time

Don't follow the freeway
Break the routine
Cuz Everything is second to your dreams
If this is the green light
Take what you need
And break out of this hospital scene
I'm running through a stop sign
Countin up the quick lights
I don't wanna slow slow slow slow down down
I'm running through a stop sign
Living so it feels right
I don't want to slow slow slow slow down down
Don't wanna slow it down

I'm running through stop sign
Got the world on my side
You know break light feeling more than alive
But it's so right see the shadow shadow tonight tonight
I'm running through stop sign
Got the world on my side
You know break light feeling more than alive
But it's so right see the shadow shadow tonight tonight
To see the shadow shadow tonight

Don't follow the freeway
Break the routine
Cuz Everything is second to your dreams
If this is the green light
Take what you need
And break out of this hospital scene
I'm running through a stop sign
Countin up the quick lights
I don't wanna slow slow slow slow down down
I'm running through a stop sign
Living so it feels right
I don't want to slow slow slow slow down down
Don't wanna slow it down
I'm running through a stop sign
Countin up the quick lights
I don't wanna slow slow slow slow down down
I'm running through a stop sign
Living so it feels right
I don't want to slow slow slow slow down down
Don't wanna slow it down slow it down slow it down---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
