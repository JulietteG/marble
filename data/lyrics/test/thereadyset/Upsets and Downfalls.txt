it's hard to write out an apology
am i the person i'm supposed to be
cause i'm a lover in a fighter's clothes
if my words fell to hold true
then i think you should know

i couldn't tell you to leave if i had to
but i can't make you believe that i want you
so please come home for it i'll make right
all the sad nights and hard lines
and i will look you in the eye
cause it's not over yet

give me your heart 
because i need it like i used to
you are a star shining down on me
i had a chance
and the chance is that baby this is all i need

see i've been running races on my own time
shutting out the people who have stuck with me my whole life
so if there's something i could say
to restitch the ties that i let fray
then i would surely patch that tear
cause loose ends can go nowhere

give me your heart 
because i need it like i used to
you are a star shining down on me
i had a chance
and the chance is that baby this is all i need

give me your heart 
because i need it like i used to
you are a star shining down on me
i had a chance
and the chance is that baby this is all i need

i know i had
my mouth won't say
i love that you love me
i swear that's the case
if you left 
with only tears
i'm stuck with these nightmares
these ghosts, and these fears
won't let you down
i'm gonna run through the night
till my soul's taken flight
left in the
i'm watching the skies open up
with my arms waving 
oh, i've missed you badly

give me your heart 
because i need it like i used to
you are a star shining down on me
i had a chance
and the chance is that baby this is all i need

give me your heart 
because i need it like i used to
you are a star shining down on me
i had a chance
and the chance is that baby this is all i need

this is all i need---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
