Dressed in my Friday best,
I'm ready to impress her whoa-oh
I like the show,
And can i say that you're the prettiest girl that i know,
Or will ever know,
So give me your hand

Got a record on the table and i think it's gonna kinda make you wanna let go
An opportunity to get a little wild, baby can i get a smile, smile, damn i hope so
Now we're turning up the heat, turn the shuffle to repeat, to repeat, to repeat, to repeat

She said i love this song I've heard it before and it stole my heart i know every word
She's gonna dance all night night,
Till it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever!
Give me your hand!

Music collided with the words singing what she wants to say
I hope its my name
And every time you hear it you'll remember this night again
Again and again
So give me your hand

Cause I'm ready and I'm able and I'm thinking' i can make you finally wanna let go
Just to show you my affections turn the speakers up, pretending that i love it til we break the windows
Now we're turning up the heat, turn the shuffle to repeat, to repeat, to repeat, to repeat!

She said i love this song I've heard it before and it stole my heart i know every word
She's gonna dance all night night,
Till it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever!
Give me your hand!

We're not coming down
You're all mine
Keep you in the sound
We're so high
Rocket to cloud nine
As we're turning up the
Best song ever
Best song ever---Lyrics submitted by Harley Sanders.
