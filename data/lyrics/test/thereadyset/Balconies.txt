So if you just ask, you know that I'll stay here
To keep you warm when midwest winter comes
If that's what you need, I think that I'd suffice, dear
I'm hoping you can take my heart and mold it into something pure and true


Oh, I see it in the look in your eyes like its not over
Oh, the way that it sways and swells like ashes in the sky

This will fall in place, this will fall in place
But I don't wanna miss one day of your eyes and your smile
And everything else that I love, that I love
So say you need me all the same, you need me all the same and you don't wanna see me go
I know it's gonna break your heart that I'm the same, but its fine, we'll be fine
We've got

You're faking me out when we were just kids, dear
The hallway where I held your hand's still there
The set and the sea is blue as fake eyes and sweet with melodies
The Florida coast line, we chased the sunrise
I'm hoping not to get to you in time
I love the Pacific, I couldn't tell you how they're different but they're here and they're now so keep your ears to the ground 
Oh, You got me all broke up over second chances
Oh, I thought that it was cool how you would play it when you're out and dancin'

This will fall in place, this will fall in place
But I don't wanna miss one day of your eyes and your smile
And everything else that I love, that I love
So say you need me all the same, you need me all the same and you don't wanna see me go
I know its gonna break your heart that I'm the same but its fine, we'll be fine 
We've got heart

We're alive
Could you ask for anything more?
We're alive
Oh oh oh oh
Don't stop, don't stop dancin' till forever
Don't stop, don't stop dancin' till forever
Don't stop, don't stop dancin' till forever
