Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I kinda feel like it don't make like like like it don't make 
feel like it don't make sense...

I'm thinking baby, you and I are undeniable
But I'm finding now love's unreliable. 
I'm givin' all I got to make you stay
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?

'Cause your a pretty little windstorm out on the boulevard 
Somethin' like a sunset, oh you're a shootin' star
And I might drive myself insane
If those lips aren't speaking my name

(pre-chorus)
'Cause I got some intuition, or maybe I'm supersticious
But I think your a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowin' down
To counter this addiction, you got me on a mission
Tell me darlin' can i get a break some how
How could I say no?

(main chorus)
She's got a love like woe (woah, woah, woah, woah)
Girl's got a love like woe (woah, woah, woah, woah) (la-da-da)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense 
'Cause your bringin' me in, and now your kickin' me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because your bringin' me in and then your kickin' me out again

It's like a hurricane, speed train
She's a movin' car 
Catch her in the fast lane
Oh, I gotta know
Can I keep up with her pace? 
Kickin' into gear when I see that face

You can take up all my time 'cause your the only one
That can make a storm cloud break, pullin' out the sun
And I can't get caught in the rain
Can I get your lips to speak my name?

(pre-chorus and main)

'Cause we only have only have one life
The timing and the moment
All seem so right
So would you say you're mine? (we'll be just fine)
Would you say your mine? (we'll be just fine)

(main chorus)
