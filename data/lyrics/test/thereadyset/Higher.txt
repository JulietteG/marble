This feeling can't be wrong.
Like it's so good, it hurts.
I've never heard this song,
But it's like I know the words.
Woke up in a dream
That I had a thousand times.
Held on real tight,
Now I got what I need to survive

What it feels like all the walls are caving in.
It's okay, we can let 'em fall.
Climb on top and we'll get higher, higher,
Get on top and take it higher.
Never wake me up.

We can watch this world spin from above.
Both eyes shut tight, don't wake me up.
If it's in my head, that's real enough.

Now we're swinging from the stars
We were reaching for.
Yeah, we're swinging from the stars.
And never wake me up.

Can't find a way to say
Without a thousand words.
One spark is all it takes
Light a flame, and let it burn.
And if it's a dream, I don't want to leave it yet.
Give it all I've got, look around, take it in.
Don't forget what it feels like.

All the walls are caving in.
It's okay, we can let 'em fall.
Climb on top and we'll get higher, higher.
Get on top and take it higher.
And never wake me up.

We can watch this world spin from above.
Both eyes shut tight, don't wake me up.
If it's in my head, that's real enough.

Now we're swinging from the stars
We were reaching for.
Yeah, we're swinging from the stars.
And never wake me up.

We've got it all, so let 'em fall.
Let your walls fall down.

We can watch this world spin from above.
Both eyes shut tight, don't wake me up.
If it's in my head, that's real enough.

Now we're swinging from the stars
We were reaching for.
Yeah, we're swinging from the stars.
And never wake me up.
And never wake me up.
And never wake me up.

We can watch this world spin from above.
Both eyes shut tight, don't wake me up.
If it's in my head, that's real enough.

Now we're swinging from the stars
We were reaching for.
Yeah, we're swinging from the stars.---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
