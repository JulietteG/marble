We'll be young forever
We'll be young forever

We can be like prisoners
And we can be alone
We can make a mess like no one knows
And risk it on our own

Spendin' the money that we don't have
Cus we don't get our owe
Livin' like kings with broken strings
And our face down to the floor

Livin' with our headphones up
We got sound and thats enough
Nobody can touch us
And we run and we run and we run

Hey hey we'll be young forever
We'll be young forever till forever stops

We're singing
Hey hey we'll be young forever
Tonight we'll run forever till our bodies drop

We can run through the night
Got our name up in the sky
Got the music still alive
Ain't no body gunna catch us singin'

Hey hey we'll be young forever
On the world forever and we'll never stop

Look at us look at us we'll take the whole world by surprise
Million dollar- mind set in place you can see it in our eyes
Everything here is ours so come take your side

Livin' like kings with broken strings
And the beats so symphasized

We can turn the speakers up
Cause we got sound and thats enough

Nobody can touch us
And we rock and we rock and we rock

Hey hey we'll be young forever
We'll be young forever till forever stops---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
