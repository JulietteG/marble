And what a heart, you've got inside your chest
It's another song worth singing
Oh, I'm not here (I have no more breath oh please)
Finally, finally

Ou, it is love (Lucky boy, lucky boy please tell me it's love)
Ou, this is love (Lucky boy, lucky boy)

And I'm afraid that I can't paraphrase
Oh just let me (Oh just let me feel) feel the way I want my heart it seems it's all on song
You know I look, I look to you in silence
The twilight such sweet, sweet bells (your lips are smooth your cheek will soon grace my)

Ou, it is love (Lucky boy, lucky boy please tell me it's love)
Ou, this is love (Lucky boy, lucky boy)

Your breath is cold (your breath is cold)
Your eyes are wide
We're in the sky (we're in the sky)
We're soaring (ouu)

The sea is cold (The sea is cold)
My heart is (my hearts calm)
It's palpitating, it's palpitating
I saw you run instead, (so divine) under my bed, (oh I love)
(Sweet girl) Sweet girl (I love you now)


Ou, show me love (Lucky boy, lucky boy please tell me it's love)
Ou, teach me strength (Teach me, teach me your strength)
Ou,(lucky boy, lucky boy) Slow me down (Slow me down)
Ou, Tie the string

Ouu, Kiss me now---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
