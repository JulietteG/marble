Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing.

Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet.
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love it's very late.
'Til morning comes, let's tessellate.

Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you.
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart.

Three guns and one goes off - one's empty - one's not quick enough
One burn - one red - one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins.
Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning.
They'll nosh you up, yes they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me.

Triangles are my favourite shape
Three points where two lines meet.
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go
My love it's very late.
'Til morning comes, let's tessellate.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
