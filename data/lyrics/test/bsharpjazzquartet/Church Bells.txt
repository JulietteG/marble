I heard church bells ringing
I heard a choir singing
I saw my love walk down the aisle
On her finger he placed a ring

Oooh, oh

I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man
I heard them promise til death do us part
Each word was a pain in my heart

All I could do was cry
All I could do was cry
I was losing the man that I love 
And all I could do was cry

And now the wedding is over
The Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads
For them life has just begun
But mine is end, ending

Ooh

All I could do was cry
All I could do was cry
I was losing the man that I love 
And all I could do was cry---Lyrics submitted by brianna.
