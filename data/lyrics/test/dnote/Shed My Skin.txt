I'm running through the fields
Laughing dreaming
I'm driving through the mountains
Breathing a new life

I don't mind what people say
No, I won't look back for another day
Wanna shed my skin and walk away

I don't mind what people say
No, I won't look back for another day
Wanna shed my skin and walk away

I'm floating through the river
Twisting and turning
Moving through the silence
Searching for new life

I don't mind what people say
No, I won't look back for another day
Wanna shed my skin and walk away

I don't mind what people say
No, I won't look back for another day
Wanna shed my skin and walk away

Walk away, walk away,
Walk away, walk away,
Walk away, walk away,---
