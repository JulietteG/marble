It was midnight when she called
Throttled in remorse
No tears, just confessions
And she (called it new over her sins)
So I knew it was a lie
But I asked for a new rendition
No-oh-oh-oh

Alberta stood in flaw
She asked for the shoe to drop
Nervous and delightful
She never wanna see those hoods again
Who waited at the county fair
Vainness ends so frightful
No-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Oh, as she's standing so
Easily misled she holds
Her carnival of pills
And she slowly makes her bed

His name was known by few
He waited on her porch
His Buick in the driveway
His leather jacket labelled "Norm"
His tattoos known to lie;
Son, just drop her on the highway
No-oh-oh-oh

She got into the car
He offered her a drink
She said she ain't got time for pity
He stopped and picked a pack of smokes
The tendrils dancing in the car
As their burning forms were sitting
No-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

And as she sits there alone in his car
She holds a carnival of pills
That she pressed against her heart

They found her facing down
On Highway 55
(Pins in teen,) then deconstructed
And none was more the wiser then
To not say her name; She lied
Thoroughly destructed
No-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

And as she lies there
Her smile looks amused
She holds her carnival of pills
No glade in the hand of doom
And as she lies there
Her smile looks amused
She holds her carnival of pills, man
No glade in the hand of doom---Lyrics submitted by Konane.
