Let me reintroduce myself as a man with a cause 
Ive had a lot of time to think and look at who we are 
and Ive got nothing left to say but we gotta carry on 
And Ive got so much left to do but ill start with this song
Why do they lie why cant you see 
get up everybody stand up with me

Lets, lets go everybody
Lets go tell them were coming 
Lets go everybody
Lets go stand up with me
Lets go, take the world with me

youve got something on your mind that you get in your way
dont tell us tomorrow you better that change today
And all we have is who we are
And all we know is pretending 
You got to pick on something real
Save the life were spending
Why do they lie why cant you see 
get up everybody stand up with me

Lets, lets go everybody
Lets go tell them were coming 
Lets go everybody
Lets go stand up with me
Lets go, take the world with me

So if you got a torch to carry hold it high
And take the world with me 
let it burn let it burn let it light up the sky
Stand up get up lets go
Stand up you gotta let them know
Stand up you got to make them see
Get up people stay up with me

Lets go everybody
Lets go tell them were coming 
Lets go everybody
Lets go so ill see
Lets go everybody
Lets go tell them were coming 
Lets go everybody
Come on everybody stay up with me
Lets go lets go take the world with me (lets go) lets go---Lyrics submitted by briana.
