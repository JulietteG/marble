I feel the pastures, 
Growing greener 
I feel the waves, 
They come all over me 

I feel the pastures. 
Growing Greener 
I feel the waves, 
They're coming over me 
and everythings alright 
Yeah everythings alright 

I hear the others 
Wondering where I've been, 
I hear my mother, 
She's worried sick again 

I hear the others 
Wondering where I've been, 
I hear my mother, 
She's worried sick again 

She whethers me 
and holds me to my own, 
She whethers me and keeps me hanging on, 
But I'll get through this,Will you? 
But I'll get through this,Will you? 
But I'll get through this,Will you? 
I'll get through this... 

In the southern, 
The air will keep you warm 
In the western, 
The air is dry as a bone 
In the southern, 
The air will keep you warm 
In the western, 
The air is dry as a bone 
And I've been wondering about that change... 
And I,I...I've been wondering 'bout that change... 

But I'll get through this, Will you? 
But I'll get through this, Will you? 
But I'll get through this, Will you? 
But I'll get through this...---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
