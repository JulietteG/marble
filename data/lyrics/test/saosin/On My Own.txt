Just say, say it in soul.

Just say, say it in soul.
This is not the home that I know. (That I know)
I never thought Id let you down
Never thought Id let you down
You promised, you promised not to let me drown.

In my deep dreams, you take over me.
In these deep dreams, you take over me.
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel my limbs again?
Is this all in my mind?
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel that way again?
Am I losing my mind?

No way, its not the same.
This place has had its way.
I swore Id never let you down
I never thought Id let you down.
Im sorry, Im sorry that I let you drown.

In my deep dreams, you take over me.
In these deep dreams, you take over me.
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel my limbs again?
Is this all in my mind?
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel that way again?
Am I losing my mind?
Am I losing my mind?

Somethings always pulling me onto ground.
Nothing staring back at me.
Is there something waiting there for me?
But theres nothing, theres nothing really (?)
theres nothing really (?)
(Somethings always pulling me onto ground)
Somethings always pulling me under.

Know my deep dreams take over me.
Will these deep dreams take over me?
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel my limbs again?
Is this all in my mind?
Can I make it on my own?
Will I ever feel that way again?
Am I losing my mind?

Somethings always pulling me onto ground.

Open your eyes, tell me why.
Open your eyes, you shall see it.
Open your eyes, tell me why.
Open your eyes, you still sleep with it.
Open your eyes. [x6]---Lyrics submitted by are_jeam.
