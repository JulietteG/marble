Dont let them know
You're watching the situation crumble
(Situation crumble)
Theses things, they take time and they know
Yes, they know they should be better now

She's watching me akwardly from a distance
Should I care?
Is there something I should have known?
I know that I wonder

They took his crown
There's nothing more left for him now
(But he will be ok)
I appreciate, now that they choose to ignore
I can set her free to go without a payment

She's watching me akwardly from a distance
Should I care?
Is there something I should have known?
I know that I wonder

Will she go or  follow?
Follow, please follow me home
Follow, please follow me home
This wont end like last time

The things you swore
They never made me feel anymore

She's watching me akwardly from a distance
Should I care?
Is there something i should have known?
I dont need to wonder---Lyrics submitted by Alejandro.
