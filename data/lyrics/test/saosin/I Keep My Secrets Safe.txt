Keep me a secret

So tell me why you've come here to bend and break
I know that you have made the same mistake
Just shut your eyes to leave 
This world of sound it's floating away
and I don't know why

You keep yourself so tightly wound, it's about time you break
It's not enough, my foolish words will never...

I keep my secrets safe
I keep them hidden away from you
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom
I know my secret's safe
I know it's hidden away from you
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom

And I have always been the same
You know that I will clean up your mistakes 
Just tell me you've found a way to stop believing
Everything you say is a lie 

You keep yourself so tightly wound, it's about time you break
It's not enough, my foolish words will never...

I keep my secrets safe
I keep them hidden away from you
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom
I know my secret's safe
I know it's hidden away from you
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom

[Screaming:]
I never had the faith to pick myself up
Come down and take me
I never had the faith to pick myself up
Breathe in, breathe out
Like a magnet, you keep pulling me closer
I want it all to end like this
I was stagnant
Then you entered my life and held it in your hands

(oh, you'll never know)

I keep my secrets safe
I keep them hidden away from you
Like an anchor stuck to the bottom
I know my secret's safe
I know it's hidden away from you

Is this the end of myself?
Is this the end? (Is this the end?)
Is this the end of myself?
Is this the end? (Is this the end?)
This is the end of myself
This is the end---Lyrics submitted by Savacool.
