I hear a signal of perjury
The odds are burning above

Begin, we've already been that far but it's not coming back
I trust the gates of the lions den I can say open up to us
Descend on us, we find a pathway to let it go

Our patience won't be alone
Our actions won't be undone
The answer will be unknown, be unknown

The begger gives up eternity
Shining light through honour

Begin, we've already been that far but it's not coming back
Descend on us, we find a pathway to let it go

Our patience won't be alone
Our actions won't be undone
The answer will be unknown, be unknown
(And you can never go home again)
Our patience won't be alone
Our actions won't be undone
The answer will be unknown, be unknown
(And you'll decide how it's gonna be)

There's a tension in the way
And it won't be underlined
You can swim into the graves easily as I
There's emotion you could fake
And it won't be in the front line
You can swim into the graves easily as I

And you'll decide how you make it
And you'll decide how it's gonna be
And you'll decide how you make it
And you'll decide how it's gonna be---
