Bury your head,
Bury your head,

I was feeling fine, you'll be coming clean tonight
And I'll be falling down with you once again
Call me your valentine, call me once tonight
And I haven't said it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them,
The things you said, I'm rehearsing them,

They went back on us
(Until his eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know when to come on to it
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love the ion vein*

Bury your head, and the child smashed you down
And the psalms will soon recall me again
Fall down below
I'll sleep tonight when you're okay
And I haven't said it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them,
The things you said, I'm rehearsing them,

They went back on us
(Until his eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know when to come on to it
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love the ion vein*

They have been the ones who've seen enough
This is what you call love?

They stole my lies,
Sold right and all,
They wandered around and round my mouth,
They stole my lie,
Sold right and all,
(Stole it all, Stole it all),
They have been the ones who've seen enough

They went back on us
(Until his eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know when to come on to it
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love the ion vein*
You'll be coming clean tonight---
