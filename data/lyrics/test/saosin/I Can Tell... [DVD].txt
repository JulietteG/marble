Betray! The Avalon is always beside me.
And I'm falling home.
Where is my home?
Orion glows.And his eye opens up.
I once believed I would set you in line.

If only I had the strength.
You'd be completely accepting something else.

If you keep asking me I'll melt away in the summer air.
It won't hurt as half as much and I'll beg you to please stop it now.
If you keep asking me I'll melt away in the summer air.
It won't hurt as half as much And I'll beg for you just tell me something.

The fluid through the alpha waves and power cables everywhere.
Exercising self-control.
The child calls.
And she lies open.
I once once believed "if only I'd be thinking at all"

You swore.
Out like my life.
You cried.
So I'm engaged to smile.---Lyrics submitted by marvin.
