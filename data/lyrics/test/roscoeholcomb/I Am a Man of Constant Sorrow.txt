i am a man of onstent sorrow i have seen trouble all my days i bid farewell to old kentucky the place where i was born and raised for six long years ive been in trouble no pleasure here on earth i found for in this world im bounde to rambel i have no friends to help me now i fare you well my own true lover i never expect to see you no more for im bound to ride that northern railroad perhaps ill die apon that train berry me in some deep vally for many years there i may lay then you may learn to love another while im sleeping in my grave maby your friends think im a stranger my face yu will never see no more but there is one promise that im given ill meet you on gods golden shore---Lyrics submitted by money.
