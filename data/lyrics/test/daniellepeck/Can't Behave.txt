(Guitar solo)

I've got eyes in the back of my head
Your halo is turning red
Foolin' around
Knockin' me off my cloud
They're talking about your
michevious ways
Good thang it's all over you face
Stealin' a kiss, misterious whispers
A phone in my pride
I'm still by your side

Chorus:

It's been one day
I'm walkin' away
The time is gonna' turn
I'm gonna' find my place
Give me a reason to stay
I wanna' be your lover,
Baby but you can't behave
Ahhh, Mmmm

Remember the days in the Nashville nights?
What happened to paradise?
Stollin' away
Knockin' my place of now
'Cause rumors are flyin' like I can't avoid
All the truth of my parinoid
Livin' like this
Is drivin' me crazy
So make up your mind
Your runnin' out of time

Chorus:

It's been one day
I'm walkin' away
The time is gonna' turn 
I'm gonna' find my place
Give me a reason to stay
I wanna' be your lover,
Baby but you can't behave
Ahhh, Mmmm

Ahhh... ease to see my worries
Please don't make me play the fool
Ahhh... Baby woncha' hurry
You don't know what your gonna' loose

Chorus:

'Cause one day
I'm walking away
The time is gonna' turn 
I'm gonna' find my place
Give me a reason to stay
I wanna' be your lover,
Baby but you can't be...

One day I'm walkin' away
The time is gonna' turn 
I'm gonna' find my place
Give me a reason to stay 
I wanna' be your lover
Baby but you can't behave
Ahhh, Mmmm

Oh baby but you can't behave
Ahhh, Mmmm

Oh baby but you can't behave
Ahhh, Mmmm

Baby you just can't be-e-have
