When we were out of time
On a highway caught by the sun 
When we were out of touch 
when we were out of feel 

Tell me why..why 
Down by the water 

Can you feel it How I breath 
Can you feel it Ive got cold feet 
Can you feel it Im out of breath 
Though I lost everyone 

Tell me why..why 
Down by the water 

When we were out in the dark 
Come on rise from the shadows 
Come on rise from the shadows

Can you feel it Im out of speed 
Can you feel it Im out of luck 
Can you feel it We are out of trust 
Can you feel it It is you and me now 

Tell me why..why 
Down by the water 

When we were out in the dark 
Come on rise from the shadows 
When we were out in the dark 
Come on rise from the shadows 
Come rise from the shadows---Lyrics submitted by gypsy.
