Sun never fades surrounding you, 
the sunrise brings you down.
When you're miles from home,
In these desert lands,
They never showed you why.

Lucy Rider,
Why does she always lose what she loves? 
Lucy rides here,
Why do we always lose what we love?

You never faced the dark clouds
That have come to shadow you,
Just trading fate 
and these far far grounds,
Have come to bring you down.

Lucy Rider,
Why does she always lose what she loves? 
Lucy rides here,
Why do we always lose what we love?

Lucy Rider,
Why does she always lose what she loves? 
Lucy rides here,
Why do we always lose what we love?
