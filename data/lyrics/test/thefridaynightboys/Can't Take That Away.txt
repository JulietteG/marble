Silence is easy
to say this is killing me
I'm sorry you wasted
a thousand tears on me
but something was missing
and I'm regretting it tonight
pushing you away
I know you dont believe me
and I just want to say

[chorus]
I remember conversations
before I gave up on me
and if it's any consolation
I remember everything
and you can't take that
no you can't take that 
away 
you were the one who saved me
and you can't take that away
away, away, away

they turned off the streetlights
before I could say goodbye
guess I was a lost cause
you still can be alive
so if you are listening
I'm regretting it tonight
maybe it's too late
but if you ever could believe me
I just want to say

[chorus]

ooooohhh
ooooohhh
ooooohhh

I remember conversations
and if it's any consolation

I remember conversations
before I gave up on me
and if it's any consolation
I remember everything
and you can't take that
no you can't take that 
you can't take that
no you can't take that
away
you were the one who saved me
and you cant take that away
away, away, away
away---Lyrics submitted by Jeanna.
