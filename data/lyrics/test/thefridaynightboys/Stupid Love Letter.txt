Cupid shot me in the eye,
So they say that love is blind.
Is she gonna say yes? 
Is she gonna say no?
Whats she gonna say? 
Take away-ay.
Am I moving too fast?
Am I thinking too slow?
I just wanna know. Oh-oh.

So I took all night to write this stupid love letter
To you, yeah you, from me to you.
And all the time that I wasted on tis stupid love letter 
To you, f*ck you, from me to you.
You said no, woah.
You said no, woah.
So I took all night to write this stupid love letter
To you.

Pick your heart up off the floor.
Leave your good intentions at the door.
Is she gonna say yes? 
Is she gonna say no?
What's she gonna say? 
Take away-ay.
Am I moving too fast?
Am I thinking too slow?
I just wanna know. Oh-oh.

So I took all night to write this stupid love letter
To you, yeah you, from me to you.
And all the time that I wasted on this stupid love letter
To you, f*ck you, from me to you.
You said no, woah-oh.
You said no, woah-oh.
So I took all night to write this stupid love letter 
To you.
Too late, all the damage is done.
Oh, theres no return to sender.

So I took all night to write this stupid love letter 
To you, yeah you, from me to you.
And all the time that I wasted on this stupid love letter
To you, f*ck you, from me to you.
You said no, woah-oh.
You said no, woah-oh.
So I took all night to write this stupid love letter to you.---Lyrics submitted by Kris.
