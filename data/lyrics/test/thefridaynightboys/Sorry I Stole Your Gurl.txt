Here we are again
Baby can't you see we can't go on
Like this, whenever,
I guess friends don't mean friends forever
If you (If you), want this ( want this ),
You better know cuz you really got something
I know (I know), you'll miss,
Every boy begging you for one last kiss

Oh, oh
I'm sorry if I stole your girl
Oh, oh
I'm sorry if she likes me more than
She ever liked you,
She never liked you
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry if I stole your girl

We (we), we let go, let go when,
The car starts spinning again and again
If you(if you), want this (want this),
I guess youve got something I can't resist

Oh, oh
I'm sorry if I stole your girl
Oh, oh
I'm sorry if she likes me more than
She ever liked you,
She never liked you
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry if I stole your girl

On the bed,
On the floor,
In the other room he's wondering where you are
So lock the door,
And close your eyes,
I guess now it's time   [x2]

Oh, oh
I'm sorry if I stole your girl
Oh, oh
I'm sorry if she likes me more than
She ever liked you,
She never liked you
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry if I stole your girl   [x2]

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Im sorry if she likes me more than
She ever liked you,
She never liked you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I stole your girl.---Lyrics submitted by Kris.
