Oooh  Ooooh 

Everybody down in Houston calls him Texas
Everybody way up north calls him cornbread
You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him baby
Daddy calls him boy, his friends call him crazy

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help
And ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting
And the high and the heat
And the left me wanting more 
Feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him whiskey

Warmed my body to the core just like a blanket
Tasted so sweet, then you took my breath away
Hit me so hard, like a rock through a window
I knew I was in trouble from the moment I met you boy

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help
And ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting
And the high and the heat
And the left me wanting more
Feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him whiskey

Now the numb set in
He's gone like the wind
And I can barely feel the pain

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help
And ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting
And the high and the heat
And the left me wanting more
Feeling when he kissed me

OOOHHHH
The burn and the sting
And the high and the heat
And the left me wanting more
Feeling when he kissed me

I shoulda just called him whiskey
I shoulda just called him whiskey
I shoulda just called him whiskey---Lyrics submitted by courtney olah.
