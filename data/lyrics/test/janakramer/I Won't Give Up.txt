Dont tell me love is something you wont try again
Thats just not true
But baby right now maybe what you needs a friend
Well, I'm here for you

[Chorus:]
I will be by your side
If ever you fall deep in the dead of the night
Whenever you call
And I wont change my mind
No, Ill see you through
And I wont give up
No, I wont give up
I wont give up on you

You need someone who knows you from the inside out
The way I do
I seen you walk the wire never looking down
I believe in you

[Chorus]

I will be by your side
If ever you fall deep in the dead of the night
And I wont give up
No, I wont give up
I wont give up
You can call it love
But I wont give up 
On you---Lyrics submitted by Tasha.
