Living in hope, hopin' for something to change
I'm sorry I spoke, I'll keep my mouth shut these days
Now he's fixin' to go, fixin' for golden
Look what he's found, letters from home
And fool's gold, the world on his shoulders
Fixin' to leave with all of his burdens
He gets scared easy these days
He gets scared easy

He's the clown prince of broken hearts
Cracks a smile when the music starts
When it's over, he falls apart
He's the clown prince of broken, broken hearts

Ringin' them bells, hearing the sound for the first time
Bracing himself for fade away full time goodbyes
And he thinks he's alive, but he's not certain
If it's genuine or if he's just pretending
Runnin' away with his imagination
Parading a smile for this miserable circus
He gets scared easy these days
Gets scared easy

He's the clown prince of broken hearts
Cracks a smile when the music starts
When it's over, he falls apart
He's the clown prince of broken hearts
He's the clown prince of broken hearts
Cracks a smile when the music starts
When it's over, he falls apart
He's the clown prince of broken hearts, yeah

When you gonna leave me on my own?
When you gonna see for yourself?
When you gonna leave me all alone?
Somebody, somebody
When you gonna leave me all alone?
When you gonna find out?
When you gonna leave me all alone?---Lyrics submitted by Tom Smith.
