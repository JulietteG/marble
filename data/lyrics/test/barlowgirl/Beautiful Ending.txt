Oh tragedy has taken so many
Love lost cause it all
forgot who you were
And it scares me to think
that I would choose
My life over you
Oh my selfish heart
Divides me from you
It tears us apart

So tell me what is our ending
Will it be beautiful
So beautiful

Oh why do I let myself let go
Of hands that painted the
stars and holds tears
that fall

And the brighter my
heart makes me forget
it's not me but you
Who makes the heart beat
I'm lost without you
you're dying for me

So tell me what is our ending
Will it be beautiful
So beautiful
Will my life find me by your side
Your love is beautiful
So beautiful

At the end of it all I wanna
be in your arms [x4]

So tell me what is our ending
Will it be beautiful
So beautiful
Will my life find me by your side
Cause your love is beautiful
So beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
