If you twist and turn away
If you tear yourself in two again
If I could, yes I would
If I could, I would let it go, surrender, dislocate

If I could throw this lifeless lifeline to the wind
Leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away
Into the night and through the rain
Into the half-light and through the flame

If I could through myself set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart away
See you break, break away
Into the light and to the day

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

To let it go and so to fade away
To let it go and so fade away
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake, wide awake
I'm not sleeping, oh no, no, no


If you should ask then maybe they'd
Tell you what I would say, true colors fly in blue and black
Bruised silken sky and burning flag
Colors crash, collide in blood shot eyes

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

If I could, you know I would
If I could, I would let it go, this desperation, dislocation
Separation, condemnation, revelation
In temptation, isolation, desolation

Let it go and so fade away, to let it go
Oh yeah and so fade away, to let it go, oh no
And so to fade away, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
Wide awake, I'm not sleeping, oh no, no, no---Lyrics submitted by Guillermo.
