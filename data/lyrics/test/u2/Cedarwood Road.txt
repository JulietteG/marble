I was running down the road
The fear was all I knew
I was looking for a soul thats real
Then I ran into you
And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
And friendship once its won
Its won... its one

Northside just across the river to the Southside
Thats a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide, the joy you hold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Up on Cedarwood Road, on Cedarwood Road

Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
Cause its never dead its still my head
It was a warzone in my teens
Im still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I cant see
You can... you can

Northside just across the river from the Southside
Thats a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
Up on Cedarwood Road, on Cedarwood Road

If the door is open it isnt theft
You cant return to where youve never left
Blossoms falling from a tree they cover you and cover me
Symbols clashing, bibles smashing
Paint the world you need to see
Sometimes fear is the only place we can call home
Cedarwood Road

A heart that is broken
Is a heart that is open---
