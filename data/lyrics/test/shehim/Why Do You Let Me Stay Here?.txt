Why do you let me stay here
All by myself?
Why don't you come and play here?
I'm just sitting on the shelf.

Why don't you sit right down and stay a while?
We like the same things and I like your style.
It's not a secret.
Why do you keep it?
I'm just sitting on the shelf.

I've gotta get your presence.
Let's make it known.
I think you're just so pleasant.
I would like you for my own.

Why don't you sit right down and make me smile?
You make me feel like I am a just a child.
Why do you end it?
Just give me credit.
I'm just sitting on the shelf.
