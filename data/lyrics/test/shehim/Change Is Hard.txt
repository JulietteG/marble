i'm all out of luck but what else could i be
i know hes yours and he'll never belong to me again
i did him wrong

(chorus)
so don't brag keep it to yourself
i did him wrong
i was never, no i was never, no i was never enough
but i can try, i can try to toughen up
i listened when they told me
if he burns you let him go
change is hard 
i should know x 3

so i'll keep my head down
if you keep it quiet for now
on in the hall
i'd rather hear slience than the bells of new love

(repeat chorus)---Lyrics submitted by whitney.
