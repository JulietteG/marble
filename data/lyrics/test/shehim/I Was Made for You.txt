i was taking a walk
when i saw you pass by
i thought i saw you looking my way
so i thought i'd give you a try

when i saw you smile
i saw a dream come true
so i asked you maybe
baby, what you gonna do?

cause i have been for a long, long time
for a boy like you
but i won't be waiting anymore cause i know
baby, baby,
i was made for you

i was taking a walk
when i saw you pass by
i thought i saw you looking my way
so i thought i'd give you a try

when i saw you smile
i saw a dream come true
so i asked you maybe
baby, what you gonna do?

cause i have been for a long, long time
for a boy like you
i won't be waiting anymore cause i know
baby, baby,
i was made for you

i was made for you,

i was made for you

i was made for you!---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
