This is not at all what it seems, there is no sorrow.
Or regret, for the choices that we make.
You'll be gone like them tomorrow.

Goddamn, I'm no killer!

Goddamn, I'm no killer!

They'll be looking, they'll be searching for days, to find a trace of your body.

I remember those confessions you made.
When you drove to my house, were you looking for trouble?
I know all those houses look the same
(We'll keep on moving with the wind at our backs)

I don't want to see you fall apart, when they come to get you.
(You're safe and sound)

I know we can have at this head start, and I'm sure we'll pull through.
(I'll keep you hidden with me)

Tell me that we'll make it out alive,
I know this desert has got its ghosts.
So know it's just a matter, a matter of time, before they find us.

Oh my my, oh hell yes!
You're being buried in your party dress.
I'll hide my face from the sun, and the fire won't stop, fire won't stop me.

Oh my my, oh hell yes!
You're being buried in your party dress.
I'll hide my face from the sun, and the fire won't stop, fire won't stop me.

You're not my usual, unusual, my usual victim.
(We'll keep on moving with the wind at our backs)

I don't want to see you fall apart, when they come to get you.
(You're safe and sound)

I know we can have at this head start, and I'm sure we'll pull through.
(I'll keep you hidden with me)

Oh my my, oh hell yes!
You're being buried in your party dress.
I'll hide my face from the sun, and the fire won't stop, fire won't stop me.

Oh my my, oh hell yes!---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
