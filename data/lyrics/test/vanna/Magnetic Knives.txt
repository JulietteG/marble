You have lost yourself.
(You will never be found)
We'll cut from ear to ear.
(We will open you up)

You have that look upon your face... The kind that razors can trace.

Can we cut to the point?
(Can we cut to the point)

Where have the carving knives gone?
(Where have the carving knives gone)

We will leave you underground, screaming out so loud.
You won't make a sound.

We will leave you underground, screaming out so loud.
You won't make a sound.

Last chance, last breathe, last words!
(On the edge of a prayer)

(Lost in love)

(Last in love)

"Whoa!"

(Lost in love)

(Last in love)

They'll need more than a shovel to dig you up.---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
