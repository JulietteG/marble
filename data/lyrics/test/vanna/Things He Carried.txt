(Light it up)
Light it up, a flash so thin.
Through a sky so grey.

Look away, our faces turned.
It's a plea to the ear, it's a walk to my hands, it's a fall to my feet,  to find sympathy.

Now you're lost in the dark, and nowhere to be found.
But I know you'll be waiting there for us
(In the dark, with nowhere to be found)
And I know you'll be waiting there.

His fortunes, our futures at hand.
We light, light up like cities in the night.

His fortunes, our futures at hand.
We light, light up like cities in the night.

Light this, like a happy scene.
(It's a set)
It's all it takes to trick our eyes and fabricate honest, honest goodbyes.

Now you're lost in the dark, and nowhere to be found.
But I know you'll be waiting there for us
(In the dark, with nowhere to be found)
When our lives light up at times like these.

At times, our lives light up like cities in the night.

At times, our lives light up like cities in the night.

His fortunes, our futures at hand.
We light, light up like cities in the night.

His fortunes, our futures at hand.
We light, light up like cities in the night.

Like rivers, we splinter.

You don't have to leave.
