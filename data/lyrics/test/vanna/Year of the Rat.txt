22 and I'm losing heart
 Self defeat becomes my art
 Deconstruct, decompose
 Alive not living and so it goes
 I'm alone, I'm alone
 A broken boy left on his own
 I'm alone, I'm alone
 I'm the only one left in my home

This is the year that I die
 How many times have I said goodbye
 Farewell to my former life
 Eyes closed hold tight
 Look to the light, look to the light
 How many times have I said goodbye
 Farewell to my former life
 Eyes closed hold tight
 Look to the light, look to the light
 I'm ready to die

Black nights and lowest lows
 And so it goes, and so it goes
 Black nights and lowest lows
 And so it goes

27 and I'm feeling right
 Cleared out the skulls and bones from my life
 Dead to myself reborn who knows
 A man proud of where he goes
 You have to breathe to be alive
 You have to suffer to survive
 You have to breathe to be alive
 You have to suffer to survive

This is the year that I die
 How many times have I said goodbye
 Farewell to my former life
 Eyes closed hold tight
 Look to the light, look to the light
 How many times have I said goodbye
 Farewell to my former life
 Eyes closed hold tight
 Look to the light, look to the light
 I'm ready to die

You have to breathe to be alive
 You have to breathe to be alive
 You have to breathe to be alive
 You have to breathe to be alive

Crawl out, crawl out of your grave
 Stand to your feet amazed
 You've made it, you're here
 No ground, no dirt, no fear
 Let the light become your own 
Don't let the grave be your home---Lyrics submitted by Nick Swanson.
