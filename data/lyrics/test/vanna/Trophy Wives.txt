Scarlet ribbons fall away.
(She lets down her hair)
So polished lips that tear your heart from your chest.

(All we are looking)
All we are looking for I found.
Young love, nursing an old soul.

I'll lay my pride down, I am still for you.
And with a heart of gold, I am still for you.
(I see them looking)

I see them looking...

The hearts you've broken, you're their queen.

They die for you!

So darling, when we dance and you sparkle, my prize.
Kiss me with that look in your eye, so they know that you're mine.

Beg love, take mercy.
Filthy is only skin deep.

(Beg love)
(Take mercy)
Filthy is only skin deep.

(Mercy) 
Mercy on me,

(Mercy) 
Mercy on me!

I'll lay my pride down, I am still for you.
And with a heart of gold, I am still for you.
(And your beauty sleep)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
