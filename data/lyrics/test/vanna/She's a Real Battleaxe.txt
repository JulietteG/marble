He waits while the city is sleeping; She takes her time.
He's lost every ounce of patience; She takes her time.

But they're catching on, they're watching us.

Inside these walls the ghosts still talk of death and beauty.
(Of times long since past)

Inside these walls the ghosts still talk of death and beauty.
(Of times long since past)

Don't forget your past.

Don't forget your past.

Through the window, watching as he walks away.
This time I've met my match.

Through the window, watching as he walks away.
This time I've met my match.

We're wrapped inside each others eyes, in this place that we call home.
Let's take our time, and try to find, the things we love to fear the most.

(Fear the most!)

This time, you've let me go.
There's nothing left for us.
We'll keep our hearts to ourselves.

This time, you've let me go.
There's nothing left for us.
We'll keep our hearts to ourselves.

(She fell like photographs)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
