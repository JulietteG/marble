Lets leave this place behind
When we finally decide
what its gonna take to make you feel alive (feel alive)
whats it gonna take to open up your eyes
to open up your eyes.

Its time to get out of this town
This torture, this torture
Your fear holds you down
BE blessed and move forward
silent and sound.


These words don't always come out right
I feel that we're wasting time
letting go of the troubles we're still holding tight
All these words don't always come out right
but I feel that we're wasting time
Are we wasting our time?
Are you still holding tight?

It was only fair to look towards the sky
To breathe in the air to wade in the shadows
With empty hands no sense of pride
Would you give if we've all given up
Till the east is ours we drew the lines that divide
Strapled these badges of pain to our sides
To our sides
We've all had our enemies
We're leaving the past behind

I don't feel like I'm losing sleep
I know you can see it in my eyes
We've all had our enemies
We're leaving the past behind
I don't feel like I'm losing sleep
I hope you can see it in my eyes

You can see it in my eyes

You can see it in my eyes

These words don't always come out right
I feel that we're wasting time
letting go of the troubles we're still holding tight
All these words don't always come out right
but I feel that we're wasting time
Are we wasting our time?
Are you still holding tight?

I'll leave my heart here
by your bedside
If you swear that your eyes wont stray
to be honest, open, and hoping,
To find the words to say
I'll leave my heart here
by your bedside
If you swear that your eyes wont stray
And honestly honestly I only let go for the sake of you...---Lyrics submitted by amber.
