All the promises we've been keepin'/given alternates
All the fires that we've feedin'
All the lies that we've been livin' in

All the promises...promises...promises...promises...promises...promises

All the promises we've been keepin'/given alternates
All the fires that we've feedin'
All the lies that we've been livin' in
Am I the only one that's still believin'

Wouldn't it be nice if we...
Could leave behind the mess we're in
Could dig beneath these old troubles... return
To find something amazing...

And Wouldn't it be cool if we...
Sail this ship to calmer seas
Turn our backs on bush fires... burn.
Leave it on the coast

All the promises we've been keepin'/given alternates
All the fires that we've feedin', feedin' feedin'
All the lies that we've been livin' in, livin' in, livin' in
Am I the only one that's still believin'

I can see you're in it to go
I think we knew this day might come
I hope you'll find what we never... ooh
Could never seem to love
But if you find just one reason to return
You'll find me open arms

All the promises we've been keepin'/given alternates
All the fires that we've feedin', feedin' feedin'
All the lies that we've been livin' in, livin' in, livin' in
Am I the only one that's still believin'
Am I the only one that's still believin'

Wouldn't it be nice, if we...

Wouldn't it be nice---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
