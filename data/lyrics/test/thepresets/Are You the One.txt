I don't know why
I've got it so bad
But somehow I got
Out of a Fry'n pan
I'm in a new file
Where at it sooner
Buried with souls
I'm back in my head so
I'm ready to go
Slipping and sliding
I'm out of control.
Tryin to hide my head in a hole.
There's something about you I've gotta know.
Before we go to far,
I wanna know...
I wanna Know...
I wanna know...
What I wanna know is
Are...Are you the One...
Are you the ONe...
Are you the One..
Are You The...

Me and my girl, hav'in the time o' time of the world
But I've got a secret
No one can know.
If you wanna find out,
Come to the show.
We've got the music,
You got to go!
Temperatures hot babe,
It's ready to blow.
Until she finds out,
all she knows.
Something's said out loud.
in on the wall.
B4 she goes to far, I wanna know...I wanna know... I wanna know...What I wanna know is.
Are... Are you the One... Are you the one... Are you the One... Are you the...

Creepin around,
cryin darkness,
Place to be found,
Leave me behind the
noise of the crouds.
Its been a while since you've come around,
So lets make it worth the-
lights to the sounds
Pills to the spills
drink to the shouts!
Still tryin to find out what its all about.
It's just one more thing I've gotta find out.
Before we go to far...
What I wanna know.What I wanna know. What I wanna know... What I wanna know is.
Are... Are you the One... Are you the One... Are you the One.. Are you the one.. Are you the One.. Are you the One... Are you the One... Are you the One.---Lyrics submitted by Diana.
