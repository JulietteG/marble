No fun, I'm on my own alone,
Thinkin' about how I could call someone
Lockdown, hang off the phone now
Wrap the comatose, sitting in the club
Ring on, bring from outside
And let's go for a ride
Diamonds in the back, Sun rooftop
This life was something when I was young

Music makes you wanna
Music makes you wanna
Music makes you wanna
It's OK, you can go
If I could go
If I could go
Crazy in a place like this!
Music makes you wanna
Music makes you wanna
Music makes you wanna
It's OK, we gonna
It's OK, we gonna
And tonight we're gonna

Good God, I'm coming on hard
This is a feeling I haven't felt for a while
Shakin' in my boom, deep in
Think I'll settle down, stay for a while
If I could go

(If I could go on,
If I could go on
If I could go on,
Crazy in a place like this
If I could go on,
If I could go on,
If I could go on,
Crazy in a place like this)

Good girl,
Couldn't frightened me away from
Pop on to the stage, pop on to my mind
Think I'll settle down, stay for a while

(If I could go on,
If I could go on,
Crazy in a place like this
Off stand
Off stand
I'd be happy in a place like this)

Happy in a place like this!
Happy in a place like this!
Happy in a place like this!
But tonight we're gonna!

If I could go on,
If I could go on
If I could go on,
If I could go on,
If I could go on
If I could go on,---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
