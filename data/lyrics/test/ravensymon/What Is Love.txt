Its the way your nervous when you speak
And the way i know just what you mean
Its the kind of thing thats bitter sweet

Its a funny feeling deep inside
So many different signs
But still so easy to define

Cause you know it every time
And its not a state of mind
You can feel the butterflies
Sending chills down your spine

{Chorus}
What is love?
But a kiss on a rainy day
A smile that wont go away
A safe place to run
What is love?
But a complicated simple truth
A bond between me and you
The number one

Oh thats love,
Oh thats love

And the things that never cross your mind
That your doing all of the time
Its cause of someone special
Its alright

Its like dancing when you walk
And singing when you talk
And your happy just to be alive

And in the moment don't pretend
Let it go or take it in
You don't have to understand
The How, Why, and When

       {Chorus}

So take off your hat and stay for a minute
Love is a precious thing if you let it in
You'll never know what you'll find
'Til you give it
Some time, some time

      {Chorus}

Oh thats love,
Oh thats love

Its that first kiss
Its the way you feel in summer
The one wish you a way space

Its that first kiss
Its the way you feel in summer
The one wish you a way space

What is love?
What is love?---Lyrics submitted by desiree.
