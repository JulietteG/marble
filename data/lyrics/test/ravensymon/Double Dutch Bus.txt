You know you want to jump on the Double Dutch Bus, so take a ride, we're waiting in the clutch.

[Verse 1:]
There's a Double Dutch Bus coming down the street.
Movin' pretty fast, so kinda shuffle your feet.
Get on the bus, and pay your fair.
Tell the driver that you're going to a Double Dutch affair. (Follow Me)

[Chorus:]
Fe Fi Fo Fum (Fe Fi Fo Fum)
We'll I'll be done, here it comes [2x]
The Double Dutch Bus is on the street [2x]
You better get on the floor, move your feet (Get on the floor, move your feet).
Ooh...Ooh...get on the Double Dutch Bus...Double Dutch Bus (Jump on it on it) [2x]

[Verse 2:]
Now I missed my bus, and I know that I'm late.
I gotta do something that I know I'ma hate.
I gotta walk to work, 15 blocks.
Just start it, I already got a hole in my socks. (I'm in lead now)

[Chorus]
Fe Fi Fo Fum (Fe Fi Fo Fum)
We'll I'll be done, here it comes [2x]
The Double Dutch Bus is on the street [2x]
You better get on the floor, move your feet (Get on the floor, move your feet).
Ooh...Ooh...get on the Double Dutch Bus...Double Dutch Bus (Jump on it on it) [2x]

[Verse 3:]
Say, Ooh (Ooh).
Say, Ooh Ooh (Ooh Ooh).
Say, Uptown (Uptown).
Say, Downtown (Downtown).
Wizzo Izzay Izzle, in Da Zouble Dizuch. (one time)
Da Zouble Dizuch [2x]. (two times)
Wizzo Izzay Izzle, in Da Za Zouble Dizuch. (Sing along now)
Da Zouble Dizuch [2x] (Now Scream).

(Jump on it on it) (Now Scream)

[Outro:]
Ooh...Ooh...get on the Double Dutch Bus...Double Dutch Bus (Jump on it on it) [3x]---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
