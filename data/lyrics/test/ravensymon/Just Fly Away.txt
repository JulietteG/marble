(I'm giving you only the truth. 
This is your last chance. 
After me there will be no more. 
If you believe in your self concience, you will stay in wonderland, 
And I will show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.)

Alice lives in a land that I am envious of.
Yellow dragons, violet cats, and black talking purple knobs. 
She steps on anything that might get in her way of home. 
You. Alice had love but she pushed all of her people away. 
She felt as if she was alone, distant, ugly, afraid. 
She didn't know that her life was already made. 

You're loved and you will find someone with your frame of mind. 
So if you would be so kind to not cross that line: 
And fall into a world where everything is flipped:
And where you fly to swim and you fly to drive. 

Fly with me in the sea, swim with me in the breeze.
Drive with me on the clouds, fly with me on the ground. 
Follow me into my rabbit hole, I'll show you everything I've been told:
I'll lead you to a land unknown, where happiness is grown.

I live in a world that alice would be envious of. 
Everybody's mind is closed there falls a white dove. 
Find your treasured feather and you better treat it right. 
Petals can unfold all at one time or all at the drop of a dime. 
With tragic reds and joyous reds of a blue yesterday,
It makes me crazy to hear of you purple yellow haze. 
Alice had it great, I wanna be like her some day.
In a world where everything is flipped and people are stuck in the maze.

Fly with me in the sea, swim with me in the breeze,
Drive with me on the clouds, fly with me on the ground. 
Follow me into my rabbit hole, I'll show you everything I've been told.
I'll lead you to a land unknown, where happiness is grown.

Fly with me in the sea, swim with me in the breeze,
Drive with me on the clouds, fly with me on the ground. 
Follow me into my rabbit hole, and I'll show you everything I've been told.
And I'll lead you to a land unknown, where happiness is grown.---Lyrics submitted by makaiza.
