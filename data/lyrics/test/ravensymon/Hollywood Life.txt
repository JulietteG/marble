She was a young girl, eighteen
Addicted to the dreams of being on the big screen
Been late on night, kissed her momma goodbye
Took the keys to the car and drove off in the night

Slow down
Don't be in a rush to leave
You'll never get these days again
But she was blinded by
All the stars in her eyes
What she wanted was the

[Chorus:]
Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh oh oh
They follow the glow
But God only knows
What it will show to you
But when the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound
Of the broken dreams on the ground

She was raised in a small town
She's been here for a year
Her body losing weight now
Never called back home
She's embarassed to go
She don't eat, she don't sleep
All she's hearing is no

Slow down
She feels like there's no place to go
There's no one there to hold her close
So in comes the knife
With the tears in her eyes
What she wanted was the

[Chorus]

All that she wanted was to live the life
Her mom got a call from her baby late one night
It was quiet on the other end of the phone
She told her baby please come back home
Everything is gonna be alright this time

[Chorus x2]---Lyrics submitted by Antoine.
