I'm a get it (girl get it)
Anyway that I can

This will be the club knock for all my ladies
That's punchin the 9 to 5 clock and gettin that dough
That took it from pushin a honda to a mercedes
And didn't have to ever ask him to spend his dough

If you hustle as hard as he do girl please (throw it up)
If you single and got your name on the deed (throw it up)
If you'd rather respond to your own needs (throw it up)
Cause the relationship thing is on E (throw it up)
Girl whatever you gotta do get the cheese (throw it up)
Don't let opinions or million stop you proceed (throw it up)
You know the ratio is one in every three (throw it up)
That mean the government know bout the casualties (throw it up)

You like that beat turn it up
When the heat come at us
Girl don't think bein content is gunna be good enough
My ladies throw it up
If you speak just like us
When you see what you want you get down and get what you want oh

This will be the club knock for all my ladies
That's punchin the 9 to 5 clock and gettin that dough
That took it from pushin a honda to a mercedes
And didn't have to ever ask him to spend his dough

So when you see so many girls as young as me (comin up)
When we were never meant to run a company (comin up)
Back when the rule for the women was don't speak (comin up)
Now we openin doors with our own keys (comin up)
Now I done seen situations you won't believe (comin up)
And girl I know how it feels to be in need (comin up)
But there is one thing them you never let em see (comin up)
And that's your tears that's a sign of the weak (comin up)
Here we go

You like that beat turn it up
When the heat come at us
Girl don't think bein content is gunna be good enough
My ladies throw it up
If you speak just like us
When you see what you want you get down and get what you want oh

This will be the club knock for all my ladies
That's punchin the 9 to 5 clock and gettin that dough
That took it from pushin a honda to a mercedes
And didn't have to ever ask him to spend his dough

I'm a get it (girl get it)
I'm a get it (girl get it)
I'm a get it (girl get it)
Cause I know that I can
