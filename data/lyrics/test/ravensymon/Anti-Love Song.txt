You might be expecting
To hear me saying things 
Pertaining love
I've been through so many other things
But I'm not wasting my time or energy 
On another sad love song 
Babe i love you plz don't go
Not even worth talkin bout

(chorus:D)
Don't want to talk about how he broke my heart
Don't want to talk about how we fell apart
So many other things I've experienced
Don't wana make this a love song
Don't wana get into what made us so happy
All the moments we kissed boy you really had me
If you wish what exists when its just a wish
Don't wana make this a love song

I'm not neglecting
All those feelings I have in me
But I just don't feel the need to express
Them so openly 
That's just not me
Becuz when I speak I want the things
That are coming from me
To be something I'm proud to speak

Cause everthing that I'm hearing on the radio
Is only about love 
How they can let it go
Long as they got everybody takes the lonely road
Is there nowhere else to go

(chorus:D)
Don't want to talk about how he broke my heart
Don't want to talk about how we fell apart
So many other things I've experienced
Don't wana make this a love song
Don't wana get into what made us so happy
All the moments we kissed boy you really had me
If you wish what exists when its just a wish
Don't wana make this a love song

(Bridge)
How can it be 
That nobody seems to care ( nobody seems to care)
That lovesongs are everywhere ( lovesongs are everywhere)

Hey (x14)

(chorus:D)
Don't want to talk about how he broke my heart
Don't want to talk about how we fell apart
So many other things I've experienced
Don't wana make this a love song
Don't wana get into what made us so happy
All the moments we kissed boy you really had me
If you wish what exists when its just a wish
Don't wana make this a love song

Don't wana make this a love song.........................---Lyrics submitted by Janai.
