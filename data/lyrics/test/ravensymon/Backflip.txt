Come on 
dont give the tired act
after you been runnin round
the time you spend with me 
you shouldnt be comin round

dont give me no attitude (attitude)
saying what you will and will not do (do)
baby we need compromise if were gonna make it through

push your self a little more boy for me your gonna have to try a little harder
i do is for the love of you yeah

show me your always gonna be there
no matter what your always gonna be there
here is what you gotta do

CHORUS

i wanna see a back flip cart wheel 
dont be cuttin corners on me
gotta give me all that you got
i need to see it to belive it
i wanna see you back flip for real
show me that you really do feel 
all that you say you do
i need to see it to believe it (ba-by babe)

dont bring me no baggage cause
i got plenty on my own
bring me all your good stuff baby
leave the rest at home

youve got your own philosophy
wanna hear all that you believe
but if it aint about being faith ful it aint im pressin me

push your self a little more boy 
for me you have to try a little harder
alli do is for the love of you

show me your always gonna be there 
no matter what your always gonna be ther
here what you gotta do
