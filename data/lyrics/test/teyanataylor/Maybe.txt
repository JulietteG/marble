(feat. Pusha T & Yo Gotti) 

Maybe, maybe it's the money, baby, maybe not 
Maybe I fell in love with ya on the spot, never lie 
I keep it G, I told you that there off the top 
Maybe you never met a street nigga thuggin' on the block 
And I ain't fuckin' with no thot shawty 
Powerball, this your shot shawty 
And if they hatin' let them talk, shawty 
And I been drinking too much, and it got me thinking too much 
You in my head what the fuck 

I say boy you done did it 
Love how you kiss it 
Ooh you can get it 
I never felt like that before 
Ooh, you the realest 
Yeah, I admit it 
All in my feelings 

Had to pause, nigga wait a minute 
Almost tapped out when you started swimmin' 
A little cocky, I can deal with that 
'Cause you put it down and I need parts of that 
Just text your phone nigga Where you at? 
Give me rounds, I need all of that 
Ain't even gotta knock, left the door unlocked 
So is you tryna take it down or nah? 
Or nah? 

Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song 
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on 
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car 
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love 

In the club twisted, reminiscing 
Boy, I can vision round two 
It's me and you and I'm winning 
It's no competition, boy, you about to 

Had to pause, nigga wait a minute 
Almost tapped out when you started swimmin' 
A little cocky, I can deal with that 
'Cause you put it down and I need parts of that 
Just text your phone nigga Where you at? 
Give me rounds, I need all of that 
Ain't even gotta knock, left the door unlocked 
So is you tryna take it down or nah? 
Or nah? 

Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song 
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on 
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car 
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love 

Who she seeing? Who she fucking on the low? 
She kissing him, she kissing her, she one of those 
Fuck is you? You TMZ, you Sandra Rose 
That's little sis, I'm big bro, so let's go 
Maybe it's the way I speak it 
Know the spot, and how to reach it 
When I meet your man, shake his hand 
That's how I keep our little secret 
Wooo, no pillow talk, no kiss and tell 
They countin' coins, my pockets deeper than a wishing well 
She like ballers, she like Birkin buyers 
She got a wild side, she like dope boys with a certain fire 
That's me nigga, so that's me nigga 
No if, ands, no maybes, so that's we nigga 

Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song 
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on 
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car 
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love 

Ooh ohh ooh 
Maybe Im in love 
Ooh ooh ooh---
