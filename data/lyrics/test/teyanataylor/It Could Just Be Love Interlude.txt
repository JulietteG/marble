Give me your love love, give me 

You knock me down, my pride hits the ground 
Don't know if this is going away 
My heartbeat jumps to the tip of my tongue 
I think you're wanting to say, come over here 

Give me your love love, give me 
Give me your love love, give me 

Boy you don't know what you're doing to me 
Just give me your love love, give me 
Right here, don't care 

It could just be love, or something like it 
Boy I don't know, but I need you right now 
It could just be love, or something like it 
I think I like it, and I'll know soon enough---
