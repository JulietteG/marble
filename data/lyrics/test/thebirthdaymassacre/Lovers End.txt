Hands cover whispers of the lovers fright
Fear cloaked renditions of that autumn night
Digging up rumors of the kids in the park
What awful things happened in the dark

Take just one last dare
Pretend you don't care
Till twilight falls
Wait there's someone else here
I can't stop my tears
I've never been so scared

In the cellar buried 6 feet deep
The lover's shaken from her dreamless sleep
Nails clawing splinters from the ceiling and floor
Shrieking like the witches til the stitches are sore

Take just one last dare
Pretend you don't care
Till twilight falls
Wait there's someone else here
I can't stop my tears
I've never been so scared

~Calling for the other
Searching for her lover
Secrets she discovers
Drain her face of color~

1...2...3...4... Underneath the cellar floor
5...6...7...8... Lover will suffocate---Lyrics submitted by Samie.
