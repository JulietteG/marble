Today is the first of our numbers
We're never asleep 
Sometimes there's a voice when I close my eyes
Sometimes I can't hear you speak

Did you learn to take cover?
Or are you running away?

And you see right through me
(This shouldn't last forever)
We're so close, now it's time to say goodbye

You wait for the sun in the morning
I'm waiting for rain
Sometimes you're too close when I close my eyes
For now, you're quiet again

When the story is over,
You'll never want it the same
Did you learn to take cover?
Or are you running away?

And you see right through me
(This shouldn't last forever)
We're so close, now it's time to say goodbye
Talk to me
(This voice is the faintest I've heard in the longest time)

Now that it's time, do you pretend?
You know I do
Do you want to see this to the end?
You know, you know I do

And you see right through me
(This shouldn't last forever)
We're so close, now it's time to say goodbye
Talk to me
(This voice is the faintest I've heard in the longest time)---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
