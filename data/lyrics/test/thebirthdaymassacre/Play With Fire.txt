A house of red light
Burn like your wanting eyes
The way is away
When we say
When we say
We will play with fire
We will play with fire

And every night, the red light
Will burn like your eyes
Our time is never
Cause we'll live forever
We will play with fire
We will play with fire

We will play with fire
We will play with fire
We will play with fire
We will play with fire---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Lowe.
