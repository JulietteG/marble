Now that you're gone 
It's been a long lonely time 
It's a long sad lonely time 
Rolling along 
I'm in a strange state of mind 
It's a strange, old state of mind 
Memories they mess with my mind 
Who am I to deny 

She was 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So bad at being in love 

Now that you're gone 
It's been a long, lonely time 
It's a long, sad, lonely time 
Rolling along 
I'm in a strange state of mind 
It's a strange, old state of mind 
Memories they mess with my mind 
Who am I to deny 

She was 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So good at being in trouble 
So bad at being in love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
