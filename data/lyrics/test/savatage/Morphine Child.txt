There's a thief on a summer's night
Across an ocean
Who sees another's life fading away

And of this life he writes
Without emotion
Then pushes it from sight
Somewhere faraway
To a distant land
Every tear betrayed
And never makes
And never makes
And never makes
And never makes a stand
never Makes a stand
Lord there's something wrong
never Makes a stand

Could a star's forgotten light
A child's devotion
Embrace eternal night
In shallow graves

As we watch from distant heights
No breath or motion
Still every ghost must haunt in its own way
Sleep beneath my dreams
Safe within my hands
Where I never under
Never under
Never understand

Lord there's something wrong

No one remembers
No one denies
No one asks questions
No one replies

Here nothing enters
Nothing departs
Here nothing's ended
If nothing starts

In your life could you carry on
Could you never think about it
Till in time you start to doubt it

Then you close your eyes
Is it really gone
How in truth can you defend her
If you're really not remembering

No regrets
If you just forget
If a memory is lenient
You can find it most convenient
So you let it fade
Till it's very vague
Just a silhouette of shadows
But the shadows are still lingering

Still I hold you there
With your endless stare

I'm too old to be living this
Lived to long to be given this
Can our god be forgiving this

I had a light that shined
Across my mind
Rarely see it any more

Now it is mostly dark
Accept for sparks
Can't remember what they're for

I am the morphine child
The dream defiled
The never ending metaphor
I am the wizard oz
Result and cause
Never look behind that door

Cantations
Cantations
Cantations
Cantations

Never listen to the crowd before me
Never listen to the self ordained
Never really wanted to believe it any way

Time is fading
Night is calling
I am on my way

Turn around turn around
Turn around turn around

Time is fading
Night is calling
I am on my...
