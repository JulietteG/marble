Why did you call again
Won't you let me be
In my dreams again
All in a sea 

Like you said in a way
She tells and leaves again
Does she know i want it now

Stranger in the dark
Taunting me
She's slipping in my dreams
Thats why she'll always be there

Jogged the long long time 
For me, forget about truth
My body sleeps till my endless 
There is a look

There is a cold in the night 
Will she ever see the light
Does she know i want it now

Stranger in the dark
Haunting me
She is always in my dreams
Thats why she'll always be there

Stranger in the dark
Haunting me---Lyrics submitted by Bora Barduk.
