Inside this cold heart is a dream
That's locked in a box that I keep
Buried a hundred miles deep
Deep in my soul in a place that's surrounded by aeons of silence

And somewhere inside is the key
To everything I want to feel
But the dark summer dawns of my memory
Are lost in a place that can never be

Can someone please show me the way?
Can someone please help me?
'Cause I cannot see and the silence is raging

Silence
Silence
Fade into silence

Memory
Memory
Inside is the key to a memory---Lyrics submitted by mohsen ansari.
