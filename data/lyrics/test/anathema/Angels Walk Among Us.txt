(only you can heal inside,
Only you can heal your life)

It must have been an angel
Who counted out the time
Yes it must have been an angel
Who raised a knowing smile
And I just couldn't reach you
No matter how I tried
No I just couldn't reach you
So instead I ran to hide

(only you can heal inside,
Only you can heal your life)

Mother can you hear me?
Can you tell me, are you there?
Father can you help me?
Cos I know that you care
And I don't have to fight it anymore
For all those years I was dreaming
And I don't have to worry anymore
Cos I found my belief in...
Mother can you hear me?
Can you tell me are you there?
Father can you help me?
Cos I know that you care

(only you can heal inside,
Only you can heal your life) ---Lyrics submitted by mohsen ansari.
