So let's find the tallest building and scream at the streets below
as you turn to me and say they're not worth our spit anyway
Talk us down, talk us down from this ledge
As we inch even closer to our death we're showing off our talents
We're good at losing balance

As we make the pavement our home (Pavement our home)
Letting go of all, all that we've known (all that we've known)

The cities never sleep when we're gone
The streets call out our name, the lights aren't the same for so long
and it's wrong to keep them waiting

So let's find the darkest alley, avoiding all contact with roads
Keeping time with our heartbeats, we rely on makeshift metronomes
Talk us down, talk us down from this ledge
as we inch even closer to our death we're showing off our talents
We're good at losing balance

As we make the pavement our home (Pavement our home)
Letting go of all, all that we know (all that we know)

The cities never sleep when we're gone
The streets call out our name, the lights aren't the same for so long
and it's wrong to keep them waiting
All year long (let's just go)
We'll say our goodbyes
Travel through the night, grab the closest wheel and drive.

As we make the pavement our home (Pavement our home)
Letting go of all, all that we've known (all that we've known)

The cities never sleep when we're gone
The streets call out our name, the lights aren't the same for so long
and it's wrong to keep them waiting
All year long (so let's just go)
We'll say our goodbyes (we'll say our goodbyes)
We'll say our goodbyes
Travel through the night, grab the closest wheel and drive.---Lyrics submitted by Blair.
