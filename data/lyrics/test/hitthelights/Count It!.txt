Count it!
One year later, and we said our "goodbyes"
States, Cities, Friends, all converted to time
And on the road from family and home it feels like, just feels right
Show to show, we saw the crowds grow
We play our hearts out, We wore are throats down
And every drop of sweat that we've bleed has been worth it, cause we earned it
While the rain the sleet, the snow, then oceans, just to get through to you(X2)---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
