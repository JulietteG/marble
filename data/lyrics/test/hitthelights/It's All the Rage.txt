We are, we are, we are exactly what you want to be
where you've been and what you've done mean nothing

you said you wanted out but now you want to go
you said you had a doubt, but now you think you know
you are, you are, you are about getting low
[x2]

you're dying for anything brand new,
hate feeling cheap but you love being used
you want out but you dig the abuse, cause it's all you know

We are, we are, we are exactly what you want to be
where you've been and what you've done mean nothing

Tear the nails from your fingertips
smear the blood across your lips
cause it's all the rage with all the kids back home
while we wrap barbed wire around our wrists
decorate the walls with our fists
live life like its hit or miss whoah

you're dying for anything brand new,
hate feeling cheap but you love being used
you want out but you dig the abuse,
cause it's all you know
[x2]

we are, we are, we are exactly what you want to be
where you've been and what you've done mean nothing

We are exactly what you want to be
where you've been and what you've done mean nothing

you said you wanted out but now you want to go
you said you had a doubt, but now you think you know
you are, you are, you are about getting low

you're dying for anything brand new,
hate feeling cheap but you love being used
you want out but you dig the abuse,
cause it's all you know

We are, we are, we are exactly what you want to be
where you've been and what you've done mean nothing

We are exactly what you want to be
where you've been and what you've done mean nothing
where you've been and what you've done mean nothing
where you've been and what you've done mean nothing
to me---Lyrics submitted by Blair.
