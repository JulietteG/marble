Close the door turn off the light
You'll never see the bloodshot eyes
because you never come around

The pictures that had lined the hall
I smashed and threw against the wall
Yeah i tore them all down
because you never come around

So maybe one day
i could be the thought of you
outta my head

you got a lotta nerve to grab my heart and rip it out
you got a lotta nerve to show me what youre all about
you got a lotta nerve to love and forgive it like a bad
dream

Traded me in hopes to find
some happiness and one more lie
yeah you had it figured out

was there a hint of honesty
in anything you said to me
yeah i wrote it all down
so i could scream it out loud

and maybe one day
i could hold it up above
your pretty blond head

you got a lotta nerve to grab my heart and rip it out
you got a lotta nerve to show me what youre all about
you got a lotta nerve to love and forgive it like a bad
dream

make me a promise that youll try
you told me everything is gonna be fine
again the second time
i hope its not another lie
youve figured it out, tore it all down
and lock it all up so i could scream it out loud

you got a lotta nerve to grab my heart and rip it out
you got a lotta nerve to show me what youre all about
you got a lotta nerve to love and forgive it like a bad
dream

like a bad dream x3---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
