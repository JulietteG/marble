Walk home,
Drowning these memories in the rain
Biting my lip to transfer this pain


You're gone
And i'm still going through withdraw
Next time around ill build a stronger wall

You broke my guard with guiltless eyes
Devoured me like a virus from inside
And came back just to salt the wounds
Now thanks to you...
I start runnin now
(I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you)
I start runnin away
When I get too close I'm scared to stay
I start runnin now
(I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you)
I start runnin away
Now others pay for your mistakes

You needed
more attention than I gave
Instead of talking
you just played games

And smiled
as my whole world became unstitched
I wish I'd known
you could be such a heartless bitch

You broke my guard with guiltless eyes
Devoured me like a virus from inside
And came back just to salt the wounds
Now thanks to you...

I start runnin now
(I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you)
I start runnin away
When I get too close I'm scared to stay
I start runnin now
(I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you)
I start runnin away
Now others pay for your mistakes

I start runnin now
I start runnin away
When I get too close I'm scared to stay
I start runnin now
I start runnin away
Now others pay for your mistakes

I start runnin now
(I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you)
I start runnin away
When I get too close I'm scared to stay
I start runnin now
(I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you)
I start runnin away
Now others pay for your mistakes---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
