dirty white, ivory white, ivory white, dirty dirty white
ivory white, dirty dirty white, dirty dirty white white

why can't i live the highlife without a comedown, why?
somebody tell me why, tell me why, tell me why.
when i'm up, it's so right, when i'm down i wanna die,
so tell me why do i why, why do i why do i why?
then i bag up again, to numb myself from the pain
try to keep it going on 'til i forget my name
ivory white, dirty dirty, white, dirty dirty, white, white

ivory white, dirty white, so dirty i'm hurting, 
it's dirty dirty white, dirty white, ivory white
cocaine champagne up all night.  it's dirty white.

skip to the loo, no skip to my deala, he got the good shit, so call it the killa
some call it the thrilla, or even vanilla, turnin 10 to a 4,
i'm blazin' thru a whore, he gives good deals you'll be back for more there was a bust last week 
now the price will soar, nostrills sore,  knock at the door
eviction notice can't live there anymore 
ivory white ivory white
ask yourselves what this happen for?  don't cry, dry your eyes, you're just high,
Bitch, you need to go to rehab and tell your story to another guy
ivory white, ivory ivory ivory dirty dirty white w-white
ivory white dirty dirty white dirty dirty white white 

ivory white, dirty white, so dirty i'm hurting, 
it's dirty dirty white, dirty white, ivory white
cocaine champagne up all night.  it's dirty white.  it's dirty white.

come get high with me, share in my misery
the room begins to spin, my eyes begin to bleed
i'm coming down for sure, and no it really hurts
i try something else, but nothing else seems to work
o it's a roller-coaster ride, i'm down and then i'm high
sometimes i laugh, sometimes i cry
not sure how i keep getting by
it's like this never-ending quest like this test i'll never pass
i keep living in this mess, dying slow and living faaaaaasssstt
yeahhhh, o yeaaah, yeahhhhh

why can't i live the high life without a comedown why?
what this happen for?  aaaask yourself, yourselfff..  what this happen for?
why can't i live the high life  ask yourself what this haaaapppeeeenn  fooor...---Lyrics submitted by Pop.
