Young man, there's no need to feel down 
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground 
I said, young man, 'cause your in a new town 
There's no need to be unhappy 

Young man, there's a place you can go 
I said, young man, when you're short on your dough 
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find 
Many ways to have a good time. 

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
They have everything for young men to enjoy 
You can hang out with all the boys. 

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
You can get yourself clean, You can have a good meal 
You can do whatever you feel 

Young man, Are you listening to me 
I said, young man, what did you want to be 
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams 
But you've got to know this one thing 

No man, does it all by himself 
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf 
And just go there, to the Y.M.C.A. 

I'm sure they can help you today 

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A., It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
They have everything for young men to enjoy 
You can hang out with all the boys. 

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A., It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
You can get yourself clean, You can have a good meal 
You can do whatever you feel. 

Young Man, I was once in your shoes 
I said, I was down and out with the blues 
I felt, no man cared if I were alive 
I felt the whole world was so jive 

That's when someone came up to me 
And said young man take a walk up the street 
There's a place there called the Y.M.C.A. 
They can start you back on your way. Ow!! 

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A., It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
Young man, Young man, there's no need to feel down 
Young man, Young man, pick yourself off the ground 

Y.M.C.A and just go to the Y.M.C.A. 
Young Man, Young Man, I was once... ---Lyrics submitted by Steven Dalgarno.
