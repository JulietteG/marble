In a basement filled with instruments
A couple of kids made an attempt
To write the world's greatest song

Matching words with melodies
Power cords and minor keys
Wondering if anyone would sing along

Well dream it big, little thunder
Time is always on your side
No one knows and so they wonder
If time will pass them by

When the rhythm and soul gets in your blood
The bass drum pulls with a mighty tug
And your mind starts to speculate

From a secret hideout underground
Is the Frankenstein we built out of sound
Really strong enough to bear the weight

Well drop the seats down in the bomber
Somehow we'll make the pieces fit
No one knows and so they wonder
If this is really it

It sounded like this
Like that
Blew out the walls
And the ceiling collapsed
Filled up my head
Was loud, it was bright
And when everyone heard it, everybody knew
Things were gonna be all right

When I was still a kid, I went with my mom
I knew every word to every song
And we sang like we were at church

In high school, getting crass
Smoking long up on the grass
Afterwards I bought myself a shirt

For a moment the sound was madness
Fear we might have gone inside
But the dancing gnomes on your serape
Brought comfort to my brain

It sounded like this
Like that

It sounded like this
Like that
It blew out the walls
And the ceiling collapsed
Filled up my head
Was loud, it was bright
And when everyone heard it, everybody knew
Things were gonna be all right

Things were gonna be all right

Things were gonna be all right

Things were gonna be all right

It sounded like this
Like that
It blew out the walls
'Cause the bass was so fast
Filled up my head
Was loud, it was bright
And when everyone heard it, everybody knew
Things were gonna be all right

From the dark recesses of your mind
We got a parachute
Gonna be all right

Well all right

From the dark recesses of your mind
Got a parachute
Gonna be all right

From the dark recesses of your mind
Got a parachute
Gonna be all right

From the dark recesses of your mind
Got a parachute
Gonna be all right

From the dark recesses of your mind
Got a parachute
Gonna be all right
When the mood gets heavy
Cymbals crashin'
Don't know what to do
You just keep on dancin'

You just keep on dancin'

You just keep on dancin'

You just keep on dancin'

You just keep on dancin'

You just keep on dancin'

You just keep on dancin'

You just keep on dancin'

You just keep on dancin'---Lyrics submitted by Emma Peach.
