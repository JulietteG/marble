All 'round this empty space
Baseboards and change with dust
Discard hopeful display
Once it aroused the brave in us
Maintain every night
Bodies achin' all the time

Things that made me smile
Made me think we'd last
Broken terrible piles
We couldn't know they'd turn so fast
She drinks red wine every night
Soakin' through all the time

Oh, oh, oh
Oh God, I'm fadin' out
No, no, no
No more straight lines

We shared the very same room
The very same bed with love
Bad night she fell asleep
I flew away and I'll never stop
We cry every night
And words are broken all the time

Oh, oh, oh
Oh God, I'm fadin' out
No, no, no
No more straight lines

Oh, oh, oh
Oh God I'm faded out
No, no, no
No more straight lines---Lyrics submitted by MacKenzie C.
