Ive been led on 
To think that weve been trying for too long
Every time we drift were forcing what is wrong
At last that voice is gone

Please take your time
But youve got to know that I am taking time
Oh you look good with your patient face
And wandering eyes
Dont hold this war inside

Come back when you can
Let go youll understand
Youve done nothing at all
To make me love you less
So come back when you can

You left your home
Youre so far from everything you know
Your big dream is crashing down
On your door
Wake up and dream once more

Come back when you can
Let go youll understand
Youve done nothing at all
To make me love you less
So come back when you can
Come back 
Ill help you stand


Let go and hold my hand
If all you wanted was me
Then Ill give you nothing less

So come back when you can---Lyrics submitted by Sana.
