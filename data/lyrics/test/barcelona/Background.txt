All your love, you gave to me
Every piece of your heart, you let me see
You filled my cup, and I felt complete
Now you wake me up, inside a bad dream

Late one night, I was out drinking
Stepped inside a bar on your street and
Saw you there, what were you thinking?
Who is he, and why are you dancing?

He touched you, in the background
It broke me, I broke down
I didn't know love could hurt this way
I didn't know love, I didn't know love

He pulled you closer, in the background
It broke me, I broke down
I didn't know love could hurt this way
How could you cheat on my heart?
I need to know

Sh-sh-shivering cold, I brought you in
Said you wanted true love, you wanna to start again
I helped you fly, I set you free
Brought you back to life, how could you turn on me?

Late one night, I was out drinking
Stepped inside a bar on your street and
Saw you there, what were you thinking?
Who is he, and why are you dancing?

He touched you, in the background
It broke me, I broke down
I didn't know love could hurt this way
I didn't know love, I didn't know love

He pulled you closer, in the background
It broke me, I broke down
I didn't know love could hurt this way
How could you cheat on my heart
I need to know

I'm not your first, you're not my last
And though it hurts, I know that it will pass [x2]

When he touched you, in the background
It broke me, I broke down
I didn't know love could hurt this way
I didn't know love

He pulled you closer, in the background
It broke me, I broke down
I didn't know love could hurt this way
How could you cheat on my heart
I need to know---Lyrics submitted by Carolyn.
