Chorus:
I can show you the Palms, the Mall, 
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M.I.A. 
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue 
To the beach in Saint Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Ain't nothin' else like L.A. 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but 
Ain't nothin' like L.A.

Verse 1:
When they come to L.A. they got the wrong impression 
When they come to L.A. they got to learn they lesson. 
When they come to west coast it's such an obsession 
When they come to play it out I'm just an exception 
When they come to you girl I need your affection 
Everytime you walk by you get my inspection 
And all you gotta do now is make your selection 
And it wont be hard to win this election 

Chorus:
I can show you the Palms, the Mall, 
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M.I.A. 
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue 
To the beach in Saint Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Ain't nothin' else like L.A. 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but 
Ain't nothin' like L.A.

Verse 2:
I done been around the world 
I ain't impressed 
I can't wait till we hit LAX 
Tokyo is cool yeah I flew to UK 
But can't nothin' fuck with Cali Forn I A 
Especially LA I'm feelin' the bay 
But nothin' like rollin' down PCH 
Top down west-bound it's all good 
You don't know Hollywood when you from Hollywood 
Let's go to the hood and fuck with the haters 
Then to the staples center hang with the Lakers 
Number 6 is cool but 24's the champ 
And even D Wade and Chris Bosh know that!

Chorus:
I can show you the Palms, the Mall, 
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M.I.A. 
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue 
To the beach in Saint Tropez 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Ain't nothin' else like L.A. 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but 
Ain't nothin' else like L.A.

Verse 3:
The BET Awards and even the Grammy's 
They always pick L.A. over Miami
I love Miami, I ain't dissin' Miami 
But where you u rather get rob for your Grammy
Ain't nothin' like Sunset Blvd 
Compton and Watts if you wanna be hard
We got it all what you thought not at all 
If you sicker then shit then take a Tylenol
It's just me and my woman 
Versus all y'all
And we takin' a bow
For a curtain call
The Angels is lost
They don't wanna be found
If God was lookin' for em I can show him around 

Chorus
I can show you the Palms, the Mall, 
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M.I.A. 
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue 
To the beach in Saint Tropez 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Ain't nothin' else like L.A. 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but 
Ain't nothin' like L.A.---Lyrics submitted by Ty.
