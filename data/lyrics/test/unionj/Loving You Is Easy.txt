We were lost in the middle
Like bottles in the ocean
But we found one another
Like the answer to a question
Like words to a love song
Like a river to the red sea
Finding you is so hard

But loving you is easy
Loving you is easy, loving you is easy
Finding you is so hard
Loving you is easy

We were lost in the middle
Like bottles in the ocean
But we found one another
Like the answer to a question
Like words to a love song
Like a river to the red sea
Finding you is so hard

But loving you is easy
Loving you is easy, loving you is easy
Finding you is so hard
But loving you is easy

Loving you, I've been loving you
Loving you, I've been loving you
Loving you, I've been loving you
Loving you, I've been loving you
Loving you, I've been loving you
Loving you, I've been loving you

Finding you is so hard

I think I've finally found the one
Here's come the change
I think the change has just begun
I'm not the same
I think I've finally found the one
Here's come the change
I think the change has just begun
I'm not the same
I think I've finally found the one

We were lost in the middle
Like bottles in the ocean
But we found one another
Like the answer to a question
Like words to a love song
Like a river to the red sea
Finding you is so hard
But loving you is easy---Lyrics submitted by ellie fielding.
