[Josh] 
Hey, you, watch d'ya say to a few drinks by the lake? 
We'll watch the sun go down 
With the music playing loud 
And no one is gonna tell us 
No, no one's telling us what to do-o-o 
(Oh yeah) 

[JJ] 
We'll be laughing 
We'll be joking 
We'll be making sweet memories 
We'll be listening to Katy, love 
And living our teenage dream 

[Josh does the melody with harmonies of the others] 
Because we are alive, crazy 
And it's beautiful to feel alright 
Knowing no one needs to fall in love tonight 
The good times have only just begun 

[Jaymi with harmonies of the others] 
Cause together 
(We are) 
We are an army and 
(We bring) 
We bring the party 
(We are) 
We are an army and we bring the party 
When we're together 

[George] 
We played truth or dare 
Made out everywhere 
And we danced on top of cars 
Wrote songs on guitars 
Fun, fun, fun 
Everything was going our way 

[Josh] 
(Oh yeah) 

[George] 
We were laughing 
We were joking 
We were doing those things we do 
We were turning up Taylor 
And going crazy like we're 22 

[Josh does the melody with harmonies of the others] 
Because we are alive, crazy 
And it's beautiful to feel alright 
Knowing no one needs to fall in love tonight 
The good times have only just begun 

[Jaymi with harmonies of the others] 
Cause together 
(We are) 
We are an army and 
(We bring) 
We bring the party 
(We are) 
We are an army and we bring the party 
When we're together 

[Josh] 
We are alone and we bring the party 
Raise up your glass and let me hear you say 
We are united 
We'll make tonight the best of our lives 
Cause 

[Josh does the melody with harmonies of the others] 
Because we are alive, crazy 
And it's beautiful to feel alright 
Knowing no one needs to fall in love tonight 
The good times have only just begun 

[Jaymi with harmonies of the others] 
Cause together 
(We are) 
We are an army and 
(We bring) 
We bring the party 
(We are) 
We are an army and we bring the party 
When we're together---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
