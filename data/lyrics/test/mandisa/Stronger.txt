Hey, heard you were up all night,
Thinking about how your world ain't right,
And you wonder if things will ever get better. 

And you're asking why it is always raining on you,
When all you want is just a little good news,
Instead of standing there stuck out in the weather. 

Oh, don't hang your head, it's gonna end,
God's right there, even if it's hard to see Him,
I promise you that He still cares. 

When the waves are taking you under, 
Hold on just a little bit longer, 
He knows that this is gonna make you stronger, stronger. 

The pain ain't gonna last forever, 
And things can only get better, 
Believe me this is gonna make you stronger. 

Gonna make you stronger,
Stronger,
Stronger,
Believe me this is gonna make you... 

Try and do the best you can, 
Hold on and let Him hold your hand, 
And go on and fall into the arms of Jesus. 

Oh, lift your head, it's gonna end, God's right there,
Even when you just can't feel Him,
I promise you that He still cares. 

When the waves are taking you under, 
Hold on just a little bit longer, 
He knows that this is gonna make you stronger, stronger. 

The pain ain't gonna last forever, 
And things can only get better, 
Believe me this is gonna make you stronger. 

'Cause if He started this work in your life, 
He'll be faithful to complete it, 
If only you believe it. 

He knows how much it hurts,
And I'm sure that He is gonna help you get through this.

When the waves are taking you under, 
Hold on just a little bit longer, 
He knows that this is gonna make you stronger, stronger. 

The pain ain't gonna last forever, 
In time it's gonna get better, 
Believe me this is gonna make you stronger.---Lyrics submitted by Blaine Landers.
