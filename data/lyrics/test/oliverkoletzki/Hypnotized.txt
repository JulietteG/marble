I catch your eyes ,try not to smile
I track your style I feel your vibes 
We have a drink then go outside
Talk for a while and then we kiss 
And then we kiss ... x2 
We play the game we start to move 
I feel my heart you feel the bit 
I take your hand you turn down slow 
We start to feel It's time ... to go.

Tonight moon it will hit the sky
And it's no surprise we'll wake up with you 
Right I shouldn't compromise,I don't have to think twice
What to do ... 

You got me hypnotized x3
So you know what to do 
You got me hypnotized x3
So you know what to do 

So we slide into the night and to the wild open flow
Oh stary eyes you see me glow so will I hide or will I show
You watch me dance I feel you move
You pull me near nothing to fear 
We drifted outside,dream aside until we slide into the light

Tonight moon it will hit the sky
And it's no surprise we'll wake up with you 
Right I shouldn't compromise I don't have to think twice
What to do ..

You got me hypnotized x3
So you know what to do 
You got me hypnotized x3
So you know what to do ...---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
