After all these years 
All of the smiles and tears
It's still a thrill to be
With you when you're with me

After all this time
I haven't changed my mind
Girl you're still my sunshine
After all these years

Through the good and bad
The Happy times and sad
My heart still feels the same
I wouldn't change a thing

And I know it's true
You feel this same way too
Our love is good as new
After all these years

 -Instrumental-

Through the good and bad
The Happy times and sad
My heart still feels the same
I wouldn't change a thing

And I know it's true
You feel this same way too
Our love is good as new
After all these years---Lyrics submitted by Eddie Collett.
