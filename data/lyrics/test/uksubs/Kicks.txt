Get my kicks on speed
A fast car is all I need
 Get my kicks on you
 A lot of time little to do

 [Chorus]
 Kicks for depression
 Need my kicks for my aggression
 Kicks for depression
 Kick oppressors and oppression

 Get my kicks on money
 Window shopping with my honey
 Get my kicks feel alright
 Sleep all day stay out all night

 [repeat chorus]

 Get my kicks at night
 Fall about when I get tight
 Get my kicks in bars
 Soft lights and loud guitars

 [repeat chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Tony Bown.
