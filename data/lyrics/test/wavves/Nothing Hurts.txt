It was a mistake for me to call you
When I knew what I'd do
I felt it every day
Since I was in your space
And I cannot stop myself from thinking
Of all the ways I'm wrong
There's truth to some cliches
I prove they're all the same

And I can tell myself that nothing hurts
That I don't need to sing
And I can tell myself that you can't feel
That you can't think of me
But to force some understanding
... my side
And you're struggling ...

It is a mistake for me to call her
When I want more than you
I feel it every day
Since I've been in your face
And I cannot stop myself from thinking
Of all the ways I'm wrong
But I move ahead each day
And I will not be the same

I move ahead each day
And I will not be the same---
