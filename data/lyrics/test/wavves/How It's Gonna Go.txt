Sun blisters in the snow
Heart beating out of chest
I'm such a fucking mess
Don't know at all
How it's going to go
Sharks swimming in the ocean
My head buried in the sand
I'm such a fucking mess
Don't know at all
How it's going to go
I don't know at all
How it's going to go

I feel it open, I feel
I feel it open up around me
I feel it open, I feel
I feel it open up around me
I feel it open, I feel
I feel it open up around me
I feel it open, I feel
I feel it open up around me

Sun blisters in the snow
Heart beating out of chest
I'm such a fucking mess, don't know at all
How it's going to go
Sharks swimming in the ocean
My head buried in the sand
I'm such a fucking mess
Don't know at all
How it's going to go
I don't know at all
How it's going to go

I feel it open, I feel
I feel it open up around me
I feel it open, I feel
I feel it open up around me
I feel it open, I feel
I feel it open up around me
I feel it open, I feel
I feel it open up around me---
