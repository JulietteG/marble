One was masculine and one was feminine 
And so they fell in love with ease.
Then the masculine one told the feminine one
How he felt about their qualities.
You are feminine but very masculine
While I am masculine but very feminine.
And such a masculine and such a feminine
Are this years perfect personalities.
Oh please be my masculine
And if youll let me be, I will be your feminine.
We once felt inadequate
It drove us mad a bit but now thats past.

And the feminine went out as masculine
She wore top hat and tails each night.
And the masculine went out as feminine
He even wore high heels despite his height.

And the feminine supports the masculine
At home the masculine cooks for the feminine.
But the masculine one and the feminine one
Felt sure something wasnt working right.
They both found the other
To be far too masculine or far too feminine
And while they got slightly riled
They soon were reconciled and fought no more.

What keeps a feminine a real feminine
Remains although its out of sight.
And the same applies to every masculine
Although its hard to hide when working right.
And when the masculine aggressive feminine
Enwrapped the feminine submissive masculine.
She had a handsome pretty mascu-feminine
A very cute hermaphrodite.
The childs an undisputed neuter
A well-suited neuter theres no cuter neuter.
And masculine and feminine
Are back in bed again and making more.---Lyrics submitted by William Bryant.
