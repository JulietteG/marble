Ok, I'll say that shit again.
Said it once before.
I just, I just, I just, I just want it all.
I glisten, shine with Mrs. Fine.
Model chick, big behind.
Bad enough to skip the line, but to me she just a nine.
I hop up out that Double-O,
You can call me Mr. Bond.
Bitch, I am a monster, I belong in District 9.
Catch me in my office doin' bidness.
Fuck you doin'?
Bullshittin'

I get all the eyes when I step inside.
They all arise when I am arriving.
Bring out the Rosae and the Ciroc.
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran.
I guess they on somethin' cause my neck look like horizon.
Just a million people behind me, and I dont have a riser man.
I'm chillin' with my niggas, nigga.
And a couple cool bitches.
Fuck you doin'?
Bullshittin'

Ma and my nigga.
Say it ain't Tom.
Hundred pretty girlies singing our song.
Yeah I kicked my feet up, you can't say I ain't home.
I be blowin' on that reefer, you can't say that it ain't strong.
And she just, she just, she just, she just went  a long dick.
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a conehead.
When I'm done, go on head.
What you thought this is?
Fuck you doin'?
Bullshittin'

I hear him, hear him, hear him, but that shit just dont compare.
I tell you you the best when i'm lookin' in the mirror.
By the time ya'll over here, I'm probably pver there.
And by the time you're riding what I'm riding, I'm up in the air.
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy I' drowsy.
My frequent flier miles is in the thousies, I'm outies.
Some where chillin' in Maui, swimmin' with the scuba fishes.
Fuck you doin'?
Bullshittin'

Nigga, I be splargin'.
I beg my pardon.
Cause ya'll niggas is starvin', lookin' for a bargain.
Go and roll that weed.
Yeah, i think it's time to spark it.
I be runnin' through them trees.
Niggas call me Tarzan.
What you think we gon' stop, won't stop, silly hoe.
I'm living out my dreams don't you dare hit that alarm clock.
I'm laid up with your girlfriend.
You knockin' like, "what you doin', nigga?"
I'm like, "Fuck you doin'? Bullshittin."
Boy.
D-Town Nigga

I hit you with an AMC, Nigga that's a full clip.
And you can be like me if you just quit with all the bullshit.---Lyrics submitted by Eleanor.
