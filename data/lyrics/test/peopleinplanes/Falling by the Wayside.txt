It's okay
To be safe
'Cause I'm on top
Of my game

But I'm losing control
Falling by the wayside

Dive right in
Take a drink
Enter it
Try and win
Make sure you call
Before you leave

Keep on to
Of the game

I'm losing control
Falling by the wayside

It's okay
To be safe---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
