Without you, its nothing 
Its just a room with a view
And all these things that weve collected
Just remind me of you

And everything I do
And every word I say to you
Theres nothing getting through
Is it over?

I should know by now
Know by now
You let me go
You let me go from you
I should know by now
Know by now
But somehow I knew I would not get through to you

Is there blood in your system?
Are there stones in your heart?
Alien creation
Go and find your star
And everything I do
And every time I talk to you
Nothings getting through
Is it over?

I should know by now
Know by now
You let me go
You let me go from you
I should know by now
Know by now
But somehow I knew I would not get through to you

I have to say
You fascinated me
But was it real?
Or was it just a dream?

I should know by now
Know by now
You let me go
You let me go from you
I should know by now
Know by now
But somehow I knew I would not get through to you

I should know by now
Know by now
You let me go
And so we break in two.---Lyrics submitted by James.
