All my friends say when you gon play?
Im always too busy, I dont need to stay up late
But I change my mind when I see your face
Cause I trust you
Now its on like Revlon, middle of the night
Gimme just a minute, man, Im higher than a kite
And I cant come down, but I know Ill be all right
Because I trust you

When you say hey, come on,
I know I really, really want to
I trust you
When I stay, I know I really ought to go
But then I trust you
I trust you
I trust you
When you say hey, come on
I know I will because I trust you
I trust you

I like to think that I am reasonable
But I cant tell you why Im down on the floor
I check my hair, but I dont know what its for
I know tomorrow that Ill trust you some more

I keep on making bad decisions cause I
I keep on drinking what youre giving cause I

(I trust you, man!)---
