What if god makes jokes
With his big brain
And he's really
Sorry about all the pain
Watching humans
Writhe and cough
While he's busy
Laughing his ass off
What if God's Not one of us
What if God don't have
A master plan
Not more or less
Than any man
What if God's
An alien
And he don't really like humans
What if God
Rides in a U.F.O.
And maybe you don't wanna know
Well you think he's
Someone you can trust
Well what if God's
Not one of us
What if god's
Not really on our side
And the reverends, priests,
And rabbis lied
And we're just vermin
On the earthen crust
With no one to
Watch over us---Lyrics submitted by CJHess.
