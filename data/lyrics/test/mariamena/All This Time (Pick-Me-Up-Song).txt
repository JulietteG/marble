You self distructive
Little girl
Pick yourself up
Don't blame the world
So you screwed up
But your gonna be ok
Now call your boyfriend
And apologize
You pushed him pretty
Far away last night
He really loves you
You just don't always love yourself.

All this time
Ohhh all this time
You have had it in you
Just sometimes need a push
All this time
Ohhh all this time
You have had it in you
Just sometimes need a push

Think all the mean girls
That pulled your hair
Are barefoot now and
Pregnant there
And you write pop songs
And get to travel around the world

All this time
Ohhh all this time
You have had it in you
Just sometimes need a push
All this time
Ohhh all this time
You have had it in you
Just sometimes need a push

So you've had some detours
Some stupid men
Now we know what not
to do again
Besides you lucked out
Finally

All this time
Ohhh all this time
You have had it in you
Just sometimes need a push
All this time
Ohhh all this time
You have had it in you
Just sometimes need a push---Lyrics submitted by Samanta.
