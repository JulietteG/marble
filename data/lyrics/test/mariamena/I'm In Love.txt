He alledgedly fell for me
through an open window
Cracked his chest open
to reveal his heart
Still sceptic of my intentions
he made me swear
That I would always be there
I will always be here

Oh, I'am in love again, again
and you may call me tomorrow my friend, yes
You may kiss me again and again
I'll hold on tight

I climbed upon his shoulders
and laughed until I cried
The view and I collide
to see this through his eyes
We never looked so pretty
never seemed so real
I let go of myself now
and tell him how I feel

Cause I'am in love again, again
and you may call me tomorrow my friend, yes
You may kiss me again and again
I'll hold on tight

So I let go of myself now
and tell him how I feel

Cause I'am in love again, again
and you may call me tomorrow my friend, yes
You may kiss me again and again
I'll hold on thight

I'am in love again, again
and you may call me tomorrow my friend, yes 
You may kiss me again and again
I'll hold on tight
I'll hold on tight

I'll hold on tight---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
