Teach me the way to be humble and good,
To be quiet when I should,
To be brave.

I am not what I was,
Or what I will be,
There is no one guessing for me.

There's a drop like a well,
And a warm, wet smell,
And there's no one to break the fall.

You're so patient and meek,
And your mouth never speaks of the times when our hopes died.

There's a drop like a well,
And a warm, wet smell,
And there's no one to break the fall.

Teach me the way to be humble and good,
To be quite when I should,
To be brave.---Lyrics submitted by Ariel.
