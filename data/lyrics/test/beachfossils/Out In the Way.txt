Are you waking me up now?
I was falling head first 'gainst the waves
It wasn't you that I could work around

And when they never get us set free
Then your jealous, keeps reminding me
Oh there's no mistake here your passing me oh oh

In the darkness passing through
Tell me is it really you?
You don't look the same 
As when I was dreaming
Even though there's not much time
I can't get it off my mind
Everything feels different
Now here without you

Even though there's not much time
I can't get it off my mind
Everything feels different
Now here without you

Out in the way...
Out in the way... (It wasn't you that I could work around)
Out in the way... (It was a rule that I could work around)---Lyrics submitted by Petar Gjalevski.
