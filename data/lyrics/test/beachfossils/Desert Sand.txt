For betting
All for works
To busy trying to save the fallen trick--
So brutal
I know they are
I couldn't sleep the streets
We're all so brutal

To timid
To be asleep
We laughed in the darkness
To the roaring sea's
So foolish
I know you are
To take a walk
and there is only stars

In heaven
I stop to breathe
But I can't read direction's in my sleep
The summer, comes with a time
and it's so beautiful I close my eyes---Lyrics submitted by Anders lson.
