There is something, watching, waiting,
There is something, passing, pressed in the shadows,
Now they make their way into my mind,
And you'll sing me to sleep, you'll sing to me gently,
And you'll sing me to sleep, you'll sing to me,
And I'm not alone,

There is something, shining, calling my name, and who are you, what do you want,
I'll claim nothing, when you're whispering,
The truth, has made its way into my head,
And you'll sing me to sleep, you'll sing to me gently, 
And you'll sing me to sleep, you'll sing to me gently,
And you'll sing me to sleep, you'll sing to me gently,
And I'm not alone,

Now I see,

And you'll sing me to sleep, you'll sing to me gently,
And you'll sing me to sleep, you'll sing to me gently,
And I'm not alone,
And I'm not alone,
And I'm not alone.---Lyrics submitted by sparkles.
