Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on!
Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on!

Sloopy lives in a very bad part of town and everybody, yeah, tries to put my Sloopy down.
Sloopy I don't care what your daddy do.....
Cause you know Sloopy, girl, I'm in love with you
And so I say now....

Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on!
Hang on Sloopy, Sloopy hang on!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Give it to em. Yeah!

What are all these flies doing in here?(various buzzing and smacking sounds)

Sloopy let your hair down, girl, let it hang down on me..
Sloopy let your hair down, girl, let it hang down on me, yeah.

Well, oh, come on, Sloopy. Come on, come on. Oh, come on, Sloopy
Oh, come on, Sloopy Come on, come on. Oh, come on, Sloopy
