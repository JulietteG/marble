Two girls for every boy.
I got a Hohner harmonica and a Vox 12 string.
Folk City here we come.
You know there's lots of protest songs that I wanna sing.
Folk City here we come.
Im going to sing all the words like Bob Dylan does,
About where its at and where it was.

Yeah Im goin Folk City cause I got to unwind
You know Im goin to  Folk city, got to blow my mind
You know Im goin to folk city cause I got to unwind
Yeah goin to Folk City got to blow my mind
Two Girls for every boy.

I am getting bugged with this feeling of being uptight. 
Folk City here we come.
Im gunna find me a chick who does everything right.
Folk City here we come.
So take a trip with me and we will be all alone,
In the jingle jangle morning like a Rolling Stone.

And Im goin Folk City cause I got to unwind
You know Im goin to  Folk city, got to blow my mind
You know Im goin to folk city cause I got to unwind
You know Im goin to Folk City got to blow my mind
Two girls for every boy.

So go away from my window come round to my door
Folk City here we come.
Cause if you wanna be in thats what its for.
Folk City here we come.
To be a little more than friends is all I want to do,
And say I would be me and, and why when were through?

And Im goin Folk City cause I got to unwind
You know Im goin to  Folk city, got to blow my mind
You know Im goin to folk city cause I got to unwind
You know Im goin to Folk City got to blow my mind
Two girls for every boy.---Lyrics submitted by Tim Kann.
