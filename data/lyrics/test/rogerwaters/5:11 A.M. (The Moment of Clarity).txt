Though the moment of clarity
Faded like Charity does...

Sometimes...

I opened one eye
And I put out my hand
Just to touch your soft hair
To make sure in the darkness
That you were still there
And I have to admit
I was just a little afraid

But then...

I had a little bit of luck, you were awake
I couldn't take another moment alone---Lyrics submitted by Jeremy.
