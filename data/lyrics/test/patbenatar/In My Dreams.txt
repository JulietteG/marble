Ive been here in this lonely place
Longer than I care to think or say
Hoping that with a little luck maybe
Id find someone like you

I watch you nearly every morning
Getting your coffee, stretching, yawning
Doing all the little things that you do
To start your day

In my dreams, In my dreams I hold your hand
Lay my cheek close to your hand
Hold back as long as I can
Feel the sweet sting of your kiss
As our lips combine

I know that youve seen me too
Once you smiled when I looked at you
I wonder if you thought about me.
The way I thought of you

Maybe I just make too much
Of passing glances, fleeting touches
Maybe Im a dreamer, maybe
So are you

In my dreams, In my dreams I held you close
Loved you the way that I hoped
Say what you already know
In my dreams I pretend
That you are mine

Guitar Solo:

In my dreams, In my dreams I hold your hand
Lay my cheek close to yours, and
Hold back as long as I can
Feel the sweet sting of your kiss
As our lips combine

In my dreams, In my dreams I hold you close
Loved you the way that Id hoped
In my dreams I pretend
That you are mine---Lyrics submitted by Tracey.
