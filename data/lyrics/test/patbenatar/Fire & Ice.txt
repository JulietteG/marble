Ooh your givin me the fever tonight
I dont want to give in, Ive been playin with fire
You forget Ive seen you work before, 
Take them straight to the top, leave em cryin for more
Ive seen you burn em before

Chorus:
Fire and Ice
You come on like a flame then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and Ice
I wanna give you my love, but youll just take a little piece of my heart
Youll just tear it apart

Movin in for the kill tonight
Youve got every advantage when they put out the lights
Its not so pretty when it fades away
Cause its just an illusion in this fashion play
Ive seen you burn em before

Fire and ice, 
You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and Ice
I want to give you my love, but youll just take a little piece of my heart

So you think youve got it all figured out
Youre in an expert in the field without a doubt
But I know you methods inside and out
And I wont be taken in by fire and ice

Fire and Ice
You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and Ice
I wanna give you my love, but youll just take a little piece of my heart
You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and Ice
I wanna give you my love, but youll just take a little piece of my heart
You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and Ice
You come one like a flam, then you turn a cold shoulder
