You say youll always be there, but I know you wont
You say you love me you swear, but I know you dont

Chorus:
Ive got better things I can do, you know
Than waste all of my time on you, why dont you just GO

You say Ive got it all wrong, that everythings changed
But I know where I belong, its far far away

Ive got better things I can do, you know
Than waste all of my time on you, Why dont you just GO

Get yourself up, get yourself movin
Dont turn around, just keep on goin
Theres nothing you can say, to change my mind today
Theres only one thing left to do, I guess youll have to GO

Guitar Solo:

You say youre a different man, but you know thats a lie
The truth is gonna set you fee, and so am I

Ive got better thing I can do, you know 
Oh oh oh
Than waste all of my time on you, you know

Ive got better things I can do, you know
Oh oh oh
Than wait all of my time on you,
Why dont you, just, you just, you just GO

GO

Go, Go, Go, Go
Go, Go, Go---Lyrics submitted by Tracey.
