Once there was a man, and he lived to sing the lions song
As he traveled on the road of hope
One love is the light, shining over every mountaintop
It will lead us to the higher ground
One day every heart will beat strong against the night
Let it be done right now

Once there was a man, and his words became a song of love
And his song became the golden dream
One love is the light, shining over everyone that believes
It will lead us to the higher ground
One day every eye will see truth before the light
Let it be done right now

Some wait, so long
Because our love is strong
This hard road traveled on
Will lead us home, forever

Hear the lion's song, voices cryin' like a desert wind
Yeah he's gone unto his father's land
Afrika tonight, for we truly are one in our hearts
Colors woven in the golden dream

One day every eye will see truth before the light
Let it be done right now
One day every voice will speak strong against the night
Let us be one right now
So let it be

We are the children of a thousand days
We are the people of the hard rain
We are the children of a thousand days
We are the people of the hard rain
We are the people of the hard rain---
