Hey, Jack, I know what you're thinking. 
That now's as good as any to start drinking. 
(Hey, Scottie!)
Yeah? 
(What's it gonna be?)
A gin and tonic sounds mighty, mighty good to me.

Man, I know, I've gotta go.
It's the same thing every time. 
But I don't think another drink's gonna 
Make me lose my mind. 
So I'll think about my next drink. 
And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3 tonight.

Well, I know this cat named Mo. 
and he wanders to and fro. 
His and my favorite watering hole. 

I says, "Hey, Mo, how you doing? 
Where have you been?"
He says, "I've been fine with my
Whiskey, wine and gin."

Oh man, I know, I gotta go. 
It's the same thing every time. 
But I don't think another drink's gonna
Make me lose my mind. 
So I'll think about my next drink. 
And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3 tonight. 

C'mon, daddy, let's get it up!

Alright, kid, let's swing it now, baby!

Hey, Jack, I know what you're thinking. 
That now's as good as any to start drinking. 
(Hey, Scottie!)
Yeah? 
(What's it gonna be?)
A gin and tonic sounds mighty, mighty good to me. 

Oh man, I know, I've gotta go. 
It's the same thing every time.
But I don't think another drink's gonna
Make me lose my mind. 

So I'll think about my next drink.

And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3 tonight.

And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3 tonight.

And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3 tonight. 

Hey, bartender! I think I need another drink!

Whaddya mean its last call? 
I just got here!---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
