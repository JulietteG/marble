It's like a bad connection
Between Love & Death
When you're six feet under
With a Dracula's breath
It ain't so complicated
When the moon shines red
You're infatuated
All the words been said

Every time I try to reach you
In those lonely hours
Feels like a lifetime without you
Under a bed of flowers

Kiss me undead
Wake me from the darkness
Kiss me undead
Break the chains of my life so heartless
Kiss me undead
Wake me from the darkness
Kiss me undead
Break the chains of my heart so bloodless

Kiss me undead
Kiss me undead

It's like a bad connection
Between Love & Death
Down to the moonshine mile
That's where I'll wait

Every time I try to reach you
In those lonely hours
Feels like a lifetime without you
Under a bed of flower

Kiss me undead
Wake me from the darkness
Kiss me undead 
Break the chains of my life so heartless
Kiss me undead
Wake me from the darkness
Break the chains of my heart so bloodless

I hope you'll find out
What you've been digging for
Frome these grounds of broken hearts

Kiss me undead
Wake me from the darkness
Kiss me undead
Break the chains of my life so heartless
Kiss me undead
Wake me from the darkness
Kiss me undead
Break the chains of my heart so bloodless---Lyrics submitted by christina.
