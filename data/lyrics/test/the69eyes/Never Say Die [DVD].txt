I guess you're seeking salvation
nothing but damnation
left for you
if you choose the wrong direction
it's a brand new feeling 
sacrificial healing
like a u-turn out of the blue 
once you're strong enough to face it

Though i'm standing by your side 
I feel so lonely I could cry

Never Say Die 
leave me alone in the night 
keep me away from the light 
razorblades cut the line 
Never Say, Never Say Die

Are you escaping the dreaming 
A life without meaning 
left for you 
if you choose the wrong direction

Let me tell you a story 
without a blaze if glory 
the darkest days are through 
once you taste my love you'll make it 

Though i'm standing by your side 
I feel so lonely I could cry

Never Say Die 
leave me alone in the night 
keep me away from the light
razorblades cut the line 
Never Say, Never Say Die 

Though i.m standing by your side 
I feel so lonely I could cry 

If I Could Feel My Heart Tonight...---Lyrics submitted by kristine.
