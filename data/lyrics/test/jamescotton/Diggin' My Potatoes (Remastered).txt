Pretend you're mean as a lion
Wild like a tiger cat
Made love to me so good last night
I almost had a heart attack

I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night
Played your little game and I got lucky last night

Pretend you're mean and evil
Stubborn like a Georgia mule
Made love to me so good last night
You had me on private school

I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night
Played your little game and I got lucky last night

Pretend you can be sweet
Pretend you can be kind
But when it come to lovin' girl
You don't draw the line

I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night
Played your little game and I got lucky last night

I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night
Played a little game and I got lucky last night

I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night
I got lucky last night, tryin' to get lucky tonight---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
