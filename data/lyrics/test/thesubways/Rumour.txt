Shame on you today
For taking what i say
And turning it into a lie
He told her and said
"I'll tell you what he did"
You think i care
I don't know why

Guilty voices and bad choices make or break you if they hate you

Don't need a reason don't need a feeling
Cold discussions, conversations
Fill this room right up to the ceiling
With your rumour

People talk aloud
Passing through the crowd
Talk, talk, talk is what you do
Carry on that way
I don't care what you say
Cos life is short and that's a truth

Guilty voices and bad choices make or break you if they hate you

Don't need a reason don't need a feeling
Cold discussions, conversations
Fill this room right up to the ceiling
With your rumour

Guilty voices and bad choices make or break you if they hate you

Don't need a reason don't need a feeling
Cold discussions, conversations
Fill this room right up to the ceiling
With your rumour [x2]
Don't need a reason don't need a feeling
Cold discussions, conversations
Fill this room right up to the ceiling
With your rumour ---Lyrics submitted by CHEE KEONG.
