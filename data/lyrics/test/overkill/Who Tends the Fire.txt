who tends the fire,
who keeps the torches lit.
who fills your eyes with smoke
so you cant see.
i need the fire
i need the torches lit
to see through all the smoke
covering me...

chorus

i have seen the fire burning
burning through the night
i have watched tides a-tourning...
and they comes from dark to light...

what is this meaning?
what does this writing mean?
where do i go....
what do i do for now?
prophecies are foolish
they never last
they never speaks the truth
so, why are they calling me now?

chorus

i have seen the fire burning
burning through the night
i have watched tides a-tourning...
and they go from dark to light...

i dont know cause i cannot see...
all i am sure is gotta be...
i m not sure that im even  me
but i know that i gotta be.
yes i know that you are gonna die
birth, life death is the reason why...
save those tears that you gonna cry
cause i know that you are gonna die.
yes i know i cannot see
and i m sure that i gotta be
all these voices are killin me
but they say that i got,
say that i got
say that i got be me.....

who tends the fire,
who keeps the torches lit.
who fills your eyes with smoke
so you cant see.
i need the fire
i need the torches lit
to see

i have seen the fire burning
burning through the night
i have watched tides a-tourning...
still the fire burns and grow---Lyrics submitted by Toro.
