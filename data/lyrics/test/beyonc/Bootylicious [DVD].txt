Can you handle this
Michelle
Can you handle this
Beyonce
Can you handle this
I don't think they can handle this whoooo

Better move
Cause we've arrived
Lookin' sexy
Lookin' fly
Baddest chick
Chick inside
Dj
Jam tonight
Spotted me
A tender thang
There you are
Come on baby
Don't you wanna
Dance with me
Can you handle
Handle me

You gotta do much better
If you're gonna dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you're gonna dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully, if you like what you see
Move, groove, prove you can hang with me
By the looks I got you shook up and scared of me
Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

Baby can you handle this
Baby can you handle this
Baby can you handle this
I don't think you can handle this

I'm about to break you off
H-town goin hard
Read my hips
Slap my thighs
Swing my hair
Squint my eyes
Lookin' hot
Smellin' good
Groovin' like
I'm from the hood
Over my shoulder
I blow you a kiss
Can you handle
Handle this

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe

Move your body up and down (whoo)
Make your booty touch the ground (whoo)
I can't help but wonder why
My vibe's too vibealacious for you babe

I shake my jelly at every chance
When I whip with my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hoping you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz

Bod,body bom,body bod.body bom,body bom.body

Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this
'cause my body's too bootylicious for ya baby x6---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
