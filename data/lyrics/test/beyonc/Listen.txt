(Beyonce):
listen to the song here in my heart a melody ive start but cant complete
listen to the sound from deep with
its only beginning to find release
ooh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
they will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all cause you wont listen
(Chorus):
Listen...
i am alone at a crossroads im not at home in my own home
And Ive tried and tried 
to say whats own my mind
You shouldve known
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
now im done beleiving you, you dont know what im feeling
im more then what you made of me 
i followed the voice, you gave to me,but now ive gotta find my own....
(Beyonce):
You should have listened
there was someone here inside 
someone i thought had died 
So Long Ago
Oh i scream and shout and my dreams will be heard
they will not be pushed aside or turned Into your own 
all cause you wont
(Chorus):
(Beyonce):
i dont know where i belong
but i'll be moving on
if you dont
if you wont....
Chorus
Ohhhhhhhhhh Listen...
to the song here in my heart
a melody ive start
but i will complete 
Ohhhhhh Ohhhhhh
now im done believing you
you dont know what im feeling
im more than what youve made of me
ive followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now ive got to find 
..my own---Lyrics submitted by Krystal.
