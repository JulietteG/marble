What goes around comes
back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes
back around (hey my baby)
         I say
What goes around comes
back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes
back around 

There was a time
I thought,that you did
everything right
No lies, No wrong
Boy I, must've been
out of my mind

So when I think
of the time that
I almost loved you
You showed your ass
And I,I saw the real you

Thank god you blew it
I Thank god I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So baby good looking now

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
Cuz' honestly you turned
out to be the (best thing 
I never had)

You turned out to be the 
(Best thing I never had)
And I'm gon' always be the
(Best thing you never had)
I bet it sucks to be you right now...

So sad, you're hurt 
Boo Hoo, oh, did you
Expect me to care
You don't deserve my tears

I guess that's why they ain't there
to think that there was a time
That I almost loved you
You showed your ass
And baby I saw,saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I Thank God that I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you 
Baby good lookin now

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
Cuz' honestly you turned
Out to be the (best thing I never had)

I said, you turned out to be
(The best thing I never had)
And I'll never be the
(Best thing you never had)

Oh baby I bet 
It sucks to be you right now
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one who's got away

Lord knows that it would take 
Another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank god I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cuz' honestly you turned
Out to be the (best thing I never had)

Oh, you turned out to be
The (best thing I never had)
And I will always be the 
(Best thing you never had)

Best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that

Cuz' honestly you turned out
To be the (best thing I never had)
Oh, you turned out to be 
The (best thing I never had)
Oh I will never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh baby I, I bet it 
Sucks to be you right now

What goes around
Comes back around
What goes around 
Comes back around
Bet it sucks to be you right now

What goes around comes back around
Bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around comes back around
Bet it suck to be you right now---Lyrics submitted by Ellen Grascia.
