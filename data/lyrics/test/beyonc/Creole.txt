Baby I see you
That look in your eyes
Hips that keep shaking
Mysterious style
Exotically tempting
Familiar to me
That Creole Sexy it's all over me

So all my redbones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor

Then you mix it up and call it Creole

(Repeat 1x)

Creole! When I look real good
Creole!Whenever I talk real good
Creole!Whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know the secret CREOLE

When she look that good
Creole!Whenever she talk that good
Creole!Whenever she bounce real good
Ladies if you wanna know it's your secret CREOLE

Bad bad bad bad redbone
Bad bad bad bad yellow bone
Bad bad bad bad brown bone
Bad bad bad bad to the bone

For all of my brown bones
That make a good ?
And all of my redbones that make a good sauce
The yellow bone flavor is familiar to me
Mix it all together it's a delicacy


So all my redbones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor

Then you mix it up and call it Creole

(Repeat 1x)

Creole! When I look real good
Whenever I talk real good
Whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know the secret CREOLE

When she look that good
Whenever she talk that good
Whenever she bounce real good
Ladies if you wanna know it's your secret CREOLE

Bad bad bad bad redbone
Bad bad bad bad yellow bone
Bad bad bad bad brown bone
Bad bad bad bad to the bone

So all my redbones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor

Then you mix it up and call it Creole

(Repeat 1x)

Creole! When I look real good
Whenever I talk real good
Whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know the secret CREOLE---Lyrics submitted by veronica.
