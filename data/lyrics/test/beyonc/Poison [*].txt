Youre bad for me I clearly get it
I dont see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss youre snatching every bit of strength
That Im gon need to fight off the inevitable
And its a heart breaking situation Im up in, but I cant control

[Chorus]
Youre just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
Youre just like poison and I just dont get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
Im not sure of what to do its a catch 22
cause the cure is found in you I dont want it but I do
Youre just like poison
My affliction, Im addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 2]
You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait Im alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
Whats the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down

[Chorus]
Baby youre just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
Youre just like poison
And I just dont get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
Im not sure what to do
Its a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I dont want it but I do
Youre just like poison
My affliction, Im addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Bridge]
Its just not my body (No)
Its my mind, you dont know
How many times I told myself
This cant do (cant do)
And that I dont need you (No I dont need you)(no)
Its so unfair(fair) that I find myself right back in your care(care)
And whats good is that when youre not always there (there there)
You know that for my health (my heath)
Youre just like poison (whoa whoa whoa) (repeat)

[Chorus]
Youre just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
Youre just like poison
And I just dont get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
Im not sure of what to do
Its a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I dont want it but I do
Youre just like poison
My affliction, Im addicted, I cant lie
Baby Kiss me one more time
youre just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
Youre just like poison
And I just dont get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
Im not sure what to do
Its a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it to
Youre just like poison
Im addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time
Before I die
