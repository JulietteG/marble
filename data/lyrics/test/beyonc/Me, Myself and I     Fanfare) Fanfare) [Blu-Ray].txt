All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out

I can't beleive I beleived everything we had would last
So young and nieve for me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

I can't beleive I fell four years and I'm smarter than that
So dumb and nieve to beleive that with me your a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on 
Cause I realize I got

Chorus
Me, myself, and I 
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on 
I'm gunna be my own best friend
(Repeat chorus)

So controlling you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with the three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over, stop calling me 
Come pick up your clothes
Aint no need to front like your still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realize I got

Chorus X2

(I got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(but once I've cired a thousand times)
All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
(how could I do these things with you)
Yeah you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(so now I've vowed to make it through)
After all the rain you'll see the sun come out again

Yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh

(i got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(but once i've cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times, but you were so fine
(how could I do these things with you)
Yeah you hurt me, but I learned alot along the way
(so now I've vowed to make it through)
I can see the sunshine 
I got me, myself, and I---Lyrics submitted by sharmayne.
