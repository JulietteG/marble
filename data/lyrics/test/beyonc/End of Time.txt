Come take my hand
I won't let you go
I'll be your friend
I will love you so, deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time

I'll be your baby
Promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy
Say you'll never let me go (Repeat X4)

Take you away from here
There's nothing between us but space and time
I'll be your own little star
I'll be shining your world
In your own little universe
Make me your girl

Come take my hand
I won't let you go
I'll be your friend
I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time

I will be your baby
Promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy
Say you'll never let me go (Repeat X4)

Baby, come on
Get up on this
Show me that you really want it
I wanna be the one to love you
Baby lets go (repeat x1)

I wanna provide
This loving that you're giving
I ain't frontin' in this love
Oh can you let me love you from your head to toe
Baby lets go

Boy come to me
Let me turn your rain into sun
You don't have to worry
I Promise I'll set your heart free
Let my love run to your soul
You go
I Go
We Go
That's all she wrote

(Say you'll
Say say
You'll Ne-Never) (Repeat X3)

Can't you see me?
I just wanna love you
Can't you feel me babe?
I just want to be with you
I just wanna live for you
I'll never let you go
Bring your love to me

Come take my hand
I won't let you go
I'll be your friend
I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time

I will be your baby
Promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy
Say you'll never let me go (Repeat X4)---
