I've wasted nights waiting all alone,
Wondering if you'd call,
If you'd ever come home.
So many tears that fell for you,
And all the heartache that you put me thru.

You can't break my heart anymore once we're through.
You thought you knew me back then,
But you didn't.
You can't have my love,
Because it don't belong to you.
You thought you knew me back then,
But you didn't, 
And now you do.

I told myself I'd never fall,
But in the end it happened after all,
How could I get so out of touch,
I can't believe that I loved you that much.

You can't break my heart anymore once we're through,
You thought you knew me back then,
But you didn't.
And you can't have my love,
Because it don't belong to you.
You thought you knew me back then,
But you didn't,
And now you do.

Ohhhh, you thought you knew me 
Now you can't have me,
Because I'm taking back control.

You can't break my heart anymore once we're through,
You thought you knew me back then,
But you didn't,
You can't have my love,
Because it don't belong to you.
You thought you knew me back then,
But you didn't,
And now you do.---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
