What's up Fresh, it's our turn baby

Gator Boots, with the pimped out Gucci suit
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's OK, cause I'm still fly
Got a quarter tank a gas in my new E-class
But that's alright, cuz I'm gon' ride
Got everythang in my momma's name
But I'm hood rich dada dada da da

Gotcha car play gems on shine, said it's mine, get a mink, baby girl lets ride
You da Numba 1 stunna, and we gonna glide
And go straight to the mall, and tear down the inside
Prowler Gucci full length leather, Bourbons cooler, Gucci sweater
Twenty inches pop my feather, The Bird man daddy, I fly in any weather
Alligator seats with the head in the
Inside
Swine on the dash, G-Wagon so Fly
Numba 1 don't tangle and twist it
When it come to these cars i am that n***a
The Gucci with the matching interior
3 wheel ride with the tire in the middle
It's Fresh and stunna and we like brothers, 
We shine like paint daddy this our summer

Gator Boots, with the pimped out Gucci suit
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's OK, cause I'm still fly
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E-class
But that's alright cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my momma's name
But I'm hood rich da dada dada da

Have you ever seen the crocodile seats in the truck? 
Turn around and sit it down and let em' bite ya butt
See, the steering wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani, 
With your baby momma, playa, is where you can find me
Pushing through the parking lot on 24's Cadillac Escalade with the chromed out nose
With the navigation arrow headed straight to loose spot
where your wife really love me cuz the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, Start the 3 wheel Benz
Hyper white lights, ultra violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
T.V., where the horn go, boy can you top that? 
I'ma show you something rookie press that button
The trunk went Eh-eh and all of a sudden
4 15's didn't see no wire's, and then I heard BOOM from the amplifiers

Let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impala Loud pipes, Drinkin the Henz
It's the birdy birdy man I'll do it again
In the Cadillac truck 24's with 10's
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
6 bad broads flying in at 9
New Suburban truck with the porno  showin'
Up and down and up they go n
Bodies on the Roadster Lexus You know with that hard top beamer
Momma that's your truck
I'm coming up the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up the bubbly
430 lex with convertible top
And the rims keep spinnin every time I stop
I got a superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

Gator Boots, with the pimped out Gucci suit
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's OK, cause I'm still fly
Got a quarter of tank gas in my new E-class
But that's alright cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my momma's name
But I'm hood rich da dada dada da---Lyrics submitted by Julie.
