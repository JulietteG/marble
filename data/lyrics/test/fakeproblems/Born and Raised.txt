On April 29th, 1980-something, I was born to a new proud mother. 
 She said she would always care for me 'til the day she died, and 
 she'd never let anyone ruin my life but they sure try.

 The day that I turned 18 my grandfather told me, he said 
 "Chris, I think you should join the army". I said I don't really 
 think I'm cut out for that, no I'm fairly certain I wouldn't last. 
 But I do agree the benefits are quite astounding, but I know that 
 I would throw up if saw someone dying.

 But if I went I would make the best of every moment, and show 
 respect to my commanding officer and come home with a medal or 
 something cool like that.

 Just a few months ago my best friend inquired, he said 
 "Do you think you'll ever go back to college?" I said yeah, sure, 
 eventually when the time is right, when I find a university I kinda like. 
 Because I do agree the experience is quite enticing, if I don't get 
 too distracted by all the drinking.

 But if I went I would make the best of every moment, and pay 
 attention to the teacher and come home with some knowledge or 
 something great like that.---Lyrics submitted by bob.
