Yeah we got just five minutes.
We got just five minutes.
'Til the man cuts a rope
And we pull away.

And there were no dry eyes.
Try to keep yours to mine.
There will be no guarantee
Of return.

And it might be running out,
Look around,
We shut it down.
We had a hell of a run.
Hold on to your hat,
Here we go.

Long way to go,
Long way to go,
Long way to go.
Long way to go,
Long way to go,
Long way to go.

And the clock says (hey)
(Do do do do do do do do do do do,
Do do do do)

Yeah we got just three minutes
'Til this all turns to mist,
And the mist burns away,
You'll walk alone,
Back into the day.
So let's drink up now,
Or we can pour the rest of it out.
Oh, but don't let this moment slip away.

Have we learned anything
Anything, I gotta think
Maybe we learned when to hush.
Hold on, here we go.

Long way to go,
Long way to go,
Long way to go.
Long way to go,
Long way to go,
Long way to go.

And the clock says (hey)
(Do do do do do do do do do do do,
Do do do do)

Yeah we've got just one minute

Long way to go,
Long way to go.

Long way to go,
Long way to go,
Long way to go.
Long way to go,
Long way to go,
Long way to go.

(Hey)
(Do do do do do do do do do do do,
Do do do do do do do do do do do,
Do do do do)---
