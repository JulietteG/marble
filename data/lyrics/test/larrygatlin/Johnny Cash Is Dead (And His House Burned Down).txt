Johnny Cash is dead and his house burned down 
(Instrumental) 
Well, Johnny Cash is dead and his house burned down, down, down. 
There's a whole lotta weepin' and wailin' in Nashville town, Nashville town. 
Well the Man in black ain't commin' back and Waylon ain't a gonna come around. 
Johnny Cash is dead and his house burned down. 

Chet Atkins & Marty Robbins ain't here to play, sing and play. 
Miss Patsy Cline was one of a kind Lord knows, Oh By the way, 
I got nothin' against the young Country Stars, but I could use more fiddles and steel guitars, 
Johnny Cash is dead and his house burned. 
(Instrumental) 
Who's gonna strap on that black guitar, walk out and sing about the way things are, 
Like the man in black singin' Folsom Prison Blues? Lord have mercy, what are we gonna do? 
Johnny Cash is dead and his house burned down. 

Well, Johnny Cash is dead and his house burned down, down, down. 
There's a whole lotta weepin' and wailin' in Nashville town, Nashville town. 
Well the Man in black ain't commin' back and Waylon ain't a gonna come around. 
Johnny Cash is dead and his house burned down.
