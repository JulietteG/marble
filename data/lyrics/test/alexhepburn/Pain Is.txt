Pain is being lost
It's being me losing the ones I love
Pain is watching my mum and cry
Just can't stop the tears
Is what I've licked on myself 
And it's how I feel
Can't keep pretending
It's gonna be alright

'Cause I don't need this love
When it hurt so much
I don't need this love
Sometimes it ain't above
I feel abandoned, straitened,lonely
Won't you wake me from this dream

Pain is losing hope
When there's no way out
And nobody's home 
Pain is just part of me
Feelin helpless inside
It's everything when I believe
When I got nowhere to hide
Can't stop the emptiness
Even if I try

'Cause I don't need this love
When it hurt so much
I don't need this love
Sometimes it ain't a love
I feel abandoned, straitened,lonely
Won't you help me mama
Soulless, helpless
Mama won't you wake me from this dream

Oh, can anybody hear me, 
Can anybody feel me
'Cause I don't even know which way to go, ohohoh 

Can anybody hear me, 
Can anybody feel me
Can't keep pretending
It's gonna be alright 

'Cause I don't need this love
When it hurt so much
I don't need this love
Sometimes it ain't enough
I feel abandoned, straitened,soulless
Won't you help me 
Mama soulless, hopeless
Mama won't you wake me from this dream...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
