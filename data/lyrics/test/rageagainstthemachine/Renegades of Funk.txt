No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now

Since the prehistoric ages 
and the days of ancient Griece,
right down thruogh middle ages
planet Earth kept goinig through changes.
And then no renaissance came (came)
and times continued to change (change)

Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine, Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were renegades of their time and age.
So many renegades

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

From a different solar system
many, many galaxies away
we are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation.
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen
And groove from land to land singin' electronic chants like:
Zulu nation,
Revelations,
Destroy our nations,
Destroy our nations.

Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies.
They change the course of history
everyday people like you and me.
We're the renegades we're the people
with our own philosophies
we change the course of history
everyday people like you and me.

C'mon.

We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.

We're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
'cause where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'.
Poppin', sockin', rockin', puttin' a side of hip-hop
'cause where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'.
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
'cause we're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop,
poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop

We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.

We're the teachers of the funk
and not of empty popping.
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics,
with the bass, and the treble, the horns and our vocals
'cause everytime I pop into the beat we get fresh.

There was a time when our music
was something called the Bay Street beat
People would gather from all around
to get down to the big sound.
You had to be a renegade in those days
to take a man to the dance floor.

Say jam sucker (jam)
Say jam sucker (jam)
Say groove sucker (move)
Now groove sucker (move)
Say dance sucker (dance)
Say dance sucker (dance)
Say move sucker (move)
Now move sucker (move)

Say jam sucker (jam)
Say jam sucker (jam)
Say groove sucker (move)
Now groove sucker (move)
Say dance sucker (dance)
Say dance sucker (dance)
Say move sucker (move)
Now move sucker (move)

We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.

We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.
We're the renegades of funk.---Lyrics submitted by Pablo.
