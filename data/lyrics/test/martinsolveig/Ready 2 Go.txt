I turn it on, I set the tone
I don't know, I'm ready to go
I saw you waking up against the wall
and I knew, you were ready to go

Tonight I'm a different guy
Forget about the things you know
If you want to do it, we can do it right
I can see you coming whole
Cause I'm ready to go
Is that a yes or no?

Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so

Show me something, we're out of time
Show me, this is it, don't change your mind

I turn it on, I set the tone
I don't know, I'm ready to go
Tonight I'm a different guy
Forget about the things you know
If you want to do it, we can do it right
I can see you coming whole
Cause you were ready to go
Is that a yes or no?
Cause you were ready to go
Is that a yes or no?
Cause I'm ready to go

I'm ready to go

Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go, If you say so
Cause I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
