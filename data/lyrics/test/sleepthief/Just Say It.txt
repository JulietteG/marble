[Vocalizing]

Just say that you love me.
Alone in silent, face to face.
Just say that you need me.
Those words that swallows this empty space.

Silence finds distance, 
and the distance will see us falter.
Violent coalition of a heart that always shames love.

Just say it's over of all we've become.
Just say that it's time listen to some.
Two tears on a gray shirt.
Never divide.
Erase all the memories.
Drowned inside.

Just say now, you've touched me.
See all that I'm feeling will come undone.
Just say in this darkness,
That you'll be here when the morning comes.

Silence finds distance, 
and the distance will see us falter.
Violent coalition of a heart that always shames love.

[break & vocalizing]

Just say it's over of all we've become.
Just say that it's time listen to some.
Two tears on a gray shirt.
Never divide.
Erase all the memories.
Drowned inside.

You say that you love me.
But those words are empty, just like my heart.
You say that you need me.
But your words just lead us to fall apart.

Silence finds distance, 
and the distance will see us falter.
Violent coalition of a heart that always shames love.

Just say it's over of all we've become.
Just say that it's time listen to some.
Two tears on a gray shirt.
Never divide.
Erase all the memories.
Drowned inside.

Just say it's over of all we've become.
Just say that it's time listen to some.
Two tears on a gray shirt.
Never divide.
Erase all the memories.
Drowned inside.

Just say it's over of all we've become.
Just say that it's time listen to some.
Two tears on a gray shirt.
Never divide.
Erase all the memories.
Drowned inside.
