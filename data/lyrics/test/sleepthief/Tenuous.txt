A single moment 
Before you call
And drew you to the sea.
A single fragment 
Of the lost that's buried deep in memory.

In stillness, 
no comfort,
In silence,
washing fervent dreams.
In stillness, 
I see you,
Returning back to me.

Returning...
Back...
To me...

[Vocalizing]

In stillness...
I see you...

A shrouded anger,
Resounding waves, 
That fall upon the shore.
I feel you moving,
To a place where I will see you nevermore.

In stillness, 
no comfort,
In silence,
washing fervent dreams.
In stillness, 
I see you 
Returning back to me.

In stillness, 
no comfort,
In silence,
washing fervent dreams.
In stillness, 
I see you, 
Returning back to me...

[whispers]

In stillness...
I...
See you...
Returning...
Back...
To me...---Lyrics submitted by Brandy.
