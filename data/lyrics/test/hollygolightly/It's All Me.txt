I'm to blame
I'm to blame
I've been feelin' bad since the day you came
But you cant stay
No, you can't stay
'Cause you might just see it's plain as day
It's all me, It's all me
And I've tried every way to make you see
But you don't see
No, you don't see
And I can't deny deep down inside
In my heart, in my heart
I feel better when we're apart
It's all me
I'm to blame
I'm to blame
I've been feelin' bad since the day you came
But you can't stay
No you can't stay
And you just don't see 
It's plain as day
It's all me, it's all me
And I tried every way to make you see
But you don't see
No, you don't see
And I can't deny deep down inside 
In my heart, in my heart
I feel better when we're apart 
It's all me
It's all me
It's all me
It's all me
It's all me---Lyrics submitted by bob mac.
