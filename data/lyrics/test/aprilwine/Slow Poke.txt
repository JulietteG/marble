I've got something
To keep you satisfied
So wont ya 'scuse me
While I slip inside
I aint gonna rush things
You know, I aint no 
speed freak?
'Cause I like to take my time
Whenever I eat

"Cause I'm just a slow-poke
Uh huh
With long strokes 
said  I'm just a slow-poke...baby
I like to take my time...hold on

I'd like to see you 
with the lights turned down
I'd like to see you 
When you go down
And I'm gonna be there
Right by your side
I'm just gonna hang 
When you take me for a ride

'Cause I'm a slow-poke
Uh huh
With long strokes
I'm a slow-poke,  baby
I like to take my time

Alright

I'd like to poke you
Right here on the floor
Now I aint gonna stop none
'til I hear you call for more
And I'm gonna tease you
'til you're ready to scream
And I'm gonna please you
It's gonna seem like dream

So how 'bout a slow-poke, 
Uh huh
With long strokes
So how about slow-poke, baby?
I like to take my time
Hold on...---Lyrics submitted by Wayne.
