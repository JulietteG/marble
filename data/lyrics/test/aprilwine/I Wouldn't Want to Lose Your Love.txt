Easy now, don't let our love go wrong
I'd never hurt you, or mean you any harm
Darling can't you see

I wouldn't want to lose your love
I wouldn't want to lose your love
I couldn't stand the pain
You know it'd drive me insane
Darling I need your love

And if tomorrow would be easier for you
And there's nothing that i can say or i can do
Well darling, please come home, you know

I wouldn't want to lose your love
I wouldn't want to lose your love
I couldn't stand the pain
You know it'd drive me insane
Darling I need your love

You're tellin' me that I've been foolish this time
You're tellin' me that i don't know my own mind
But darling can't you see

I wouldn't want to lose your love
I wouldn't want to lose your love
I couldn't stand the pain
You know it'd drive me insane
Darling I need your love (love love love love.......)
Darling I need your love (love love love love.......)
Don't wanna lose your love (love love love love.......)---Lyrics submitted by Nathan Davis.
