Well you can call me a punk, I like to scrap when I'm drunk 
And I'm just likely to cause a scene 
I got an old Cadillac, I like to sit in the back 
And flog the dog between the covers of Sex-teen 

Hey man, I said now don't push me around 
Hey man, I'm eighteen and I've been around 

I'm gonna buy me some wine, I'm gonna have a good time 
And don't you tell me what I shouldn't do 
Cause you just don't understand, I'm not a boy, I'm a man 
But you don't wanna hear from nothin', now do you 

Hey man, I said now don't push me around 
Hey man, I'm eighteen and I've been around 

Well you can tell me I'm right, and you can tell me I'm wrong 
But I don't really care what you say 
I'm gonna drive into town with the top rolled down 
And find me someone who's been feelin' the same way 
Been pushed around, I've been taken by clowns 
They're makin' millions just for fun, what a bad break 
And who's to know if the show was a show 
With his picture on the cover of Newsweek 

Now hey man, I said don't push me around 
Hey man, I'm eighteen and I've been around 
Hey man, I said now don't push me around 
Hey man, I'm eighteen and I've been around---Lyrics submitted by Bill.
