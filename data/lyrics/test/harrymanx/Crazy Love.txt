i can hear a heartbeat
for a thousand miles
heavens open up
everytime she smiles
when im with 
oh thats where i belong
and now im rolling to her
like a river rolling strong

you give me love love love
well well now, crazy love
she give me love love love
well well now, crazy love

shes got a fine sense of humour
when im feelin down
and im comin to her
when the sun goes round
gunna take away my trouble
woah gunna take away my grief
take away my heartake
on a night like this

yah she give me love love love
well well now, crazy love
she give me love love love
well well now, crazy love

yah i need her in the morning
yah i need her late at night
yah i wanna wrap my lovin arms around her
well well now, kiss and love and hold her tight

oh when im turning and i feel so far away
she brings me sunshine 
yah gunna brighten up my day
makes me happy
oh makes me whole
makes me righteous now right down to my soul

yah she give me love love love 
well well now, crazy love
she give me love love love
well well now, crazy love
she give me love love love
well well now, crazy love
she give me love love love
well well now, oh oh oh crazy love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
