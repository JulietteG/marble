Yesterday I spotted you
Hanging out with someone new
Come on dude, I can't believe who
Did it hurt? Oh yes it hurt
But not as much as I thought it would
Guess it's time for me to move on

I'm getting closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)
Everyday's closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)

I finally took your pictures down
And all that other stuff I found
Hidden somewhere in my closet
I used to wear your shirt to bed
But now it's in the trash instead
I don't want to be reminded. No, no.

I'm getting closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)
Everyday's closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)

I saw you today taking my breath away
But then you opened your mouth without thinking
And then I recalled why I ended it all
And it makes me feel good about leaving (leaving)

Mmm...
Everyday everyday everyday
Everyday everyday everyday everyday
I'm getting closer

I'm getting closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)
Everyday's closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
