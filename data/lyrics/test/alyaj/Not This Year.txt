This Christmas card, 
is so contrived.
A manniquin,
seems more alive

Haven't meant a word,
i've written here.
The page is full 
but not one word sincere.

Chorus:

I cant, I cant, I can't take it
this is the time to smile i can't take it
please allow me the chance now to break it down
it's not snow it's rain coming down and the lights are cool but they burn out
And i cant pull off the cheer
Not this year, not this year, not this year

When i look 
into the mirror
no happiness
 is present here

Not supposed to whine 
not supposed to cry 
try to hold it in 
but not this time

Chorus:
i cant i cant i cant take it
this is the time to smile i cant fake it 
please allow me the chance now to break it down
its not snow its rain coming down 
and the lights are cool but they burn out
and i cant pull of the cheer
not this year not this year not this year 


Don't know don't know 
if you can here me 
I will I will
speak louder for you

No more whisperin' 
are you listnin' 
I am pleadin'
I am pleadin"

I can't  I can't

It's not snow its rain comin' down
and the lights are cool but the burn out
and i can't pull of the cheer 
not this year not this year not this year---Lyrics submitted by monica.
