I didn't know what was in store. 
When I walked right through the door. 
Then I saw you over there, our blue eyes locked in a stare. 
I didn't know quite what to say, sometimes words get in the way.

And I remember the night you said, 
"Lets go for a ride" I didn't want the night to end. 
Would we be more than friends? 
Yet little did I know before, 
we would be something more. 

In black and white I read the screen, all your lines and in-between. 
Then your message on the phone, I save to hear when I'm all alone. 
And Now I know just what to say, this doesn't happen everyday. 

And I remember the night you said, 
"Lets go for a ride" I didn't want the night to end. 
Would we be more than friends? 
Yet little did I know before, we would be something more.

Something more, something more. (na na na na,na na na yeah) 
We would be something more, something more, something more.

I know we're both young, but we know how we feel. 
We know what is false, and we know what is real.
And I remember the night you said "lets go for a ride"... 
I didnt want the night to end....

And I remember the night you said, 
"Lets go for a ride" I didn't want the night to end. 
Would we be more than friends? 
Yet little did I know before, we would be something more.

And I remember the night you said, 
"Lets go for a ride" I didn't want the night to end. 
Would we be more than friends? 
Yet little did I know before, we would be something more.

Something more, something more. (na na na na,na na na yeah) 
Something more, something more. (na na na na,na na na yeah)---Lyrics submitted by Caitlin.
