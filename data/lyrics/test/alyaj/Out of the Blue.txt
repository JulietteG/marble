When somethings pure
How can people just say
We're not meant to be
And when somethings true
How can people just
Keep me away from you

Suddenly I'm all alone
Pushed away from nothing wrong
Don't you have the guts to say
How you feel about me

Out of the blue
They said we couldn't be together
I have to get over you
We've been given no choice,
We have no voice
Out of the blue

Can't even call on the telephone
Don't even know if you're at home
But to control just how we feel
Between you and I
Not for one to steal

Suddenly I'm all alone
Pushed away from nothing wrong
Don't you have the guts to say
How you feel about me

Out of the blue
They said we couldn't be together
I have to get over you
We've been given no choice,
We have no voice

Just wanna hear what you've got to say
Are you feeling the same
'Cause I'm not okay
Thought when we met there was something more
But the others said no - they shut the door

Out of the blue
They said we couldn't be together
I have to get over you
We've been given no choice,
We have no voice

Out of the blue
We knew should have been together
Don't wanna get over you
When love makes a choice, it has a voice
Out of the blue---Lyrics submitted by Jemma.
