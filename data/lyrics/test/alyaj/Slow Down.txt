I need a little time, to see what you're made of 
I know what's on your mind 
You're headin' straight for love 

Let's not rush, you're moving way too fast 
We can figure it out, we can make this last 
We don't have to be so serious 
You need to 

Slow down !
I'm not goin' anywhere 
Slow down !
If you care, I need a little time for air 
If you just let me breathe 
Maybe I'll stick around 
If you slow down !

I wanna little space, a little less attention 
You see it on my face 
Don't need an explanation 

Let's not rush, you're movin' way too fast 
We can figure it out, we can make this last 
We don't have to be so serious 
You need to 

Slow down !
I'm not goin' anywhere 
Slow down !
If you care, i need a little time for air 
If you just let me breathe 
Maybe I'll stick around 
If you slow down !

Keep callin' - you won't leave me alone 
Proclaiming love like it's a joke 
Leavin' flowers at my door 
Have enough don't need anymore 
Believe in what we have right now 
Have to slow down !

I'm not goin' anywhere ...

Slow down !
I'm not goin' anywhere 
Slow down !
If you care, I need a little time for air 
If you just let me breathe 
Maybe I'll stick around 
Slow down !

I'm not goin' anywhere 

Slow down !
If you care, I need a little time for air 
If you just let me breathe 
Maybe I'll stick around 

Ya have to slow down - yeah ...

If you just let me breathe 
Maybe I'll stick around 
Not goin' anywhere 
If you just let me breathe 
Maybe I'll stick around 
Not goin' anywhere 
Slow down...
If you just let me breathe 
Maybe I'll stick around 
Not goin' anywhere 
If you slow down---Lyrics submitted by Dvid.
