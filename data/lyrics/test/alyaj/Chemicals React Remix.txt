You make me feel, out of my element
Like i'm walking on broken glass
Like my worlds spinnin in slow motion
And your movin to fast

Were you right, Was i wrong
Were you weak, Was i strong, yeah
Both of us broken
Caught in the moment
We lived and we loved
And we hurt and we joked, yeah
But the planets all alligned
When you looked into my eyes
And just like that
The chemicals react (x2)

You make me feel out of my element
Like i'm driftin out to the sea
Like the tides pullin me in deeper
Makin it harder to breath

We cannot deny how we feel inside
We cannot deny

Were you right, Was i wrong
Were you weak, Was i strong, yeah
Both of us broken
Caught in the moment
We lived and we loved
And we hurt and we joked, yeah
But the planets all alligned
When you looked into my eyes
And just like that
The chemicals react (x2)

Kaliedoscope of colors
Turnin hope on fire, Sun is burnin
Shinin down on both of us
Don't let us lose it (don't let us lose it...)

Were you right, Was i wrong
Were you weak, Was i strong, yeah
Both of us broken
Caught in the moment
We lived and we loved
And we hurt and we joked, yeah

We lived
We loved
We hurt
We joked
We're right
We're wrong
We're weak
We're strong
We lived to love

But the planets all alligned
When you looked into my eyes
And just like that
Watch the chemicals react
The chemicals react
