I found it on the sidewalk last night
a coffin made of ivory
with its lid pushed aside

As I was getting closer
looking down
covered up in purple plastic balls
it was you that I found

Before I had a chance to reach down and give my hand to you
like a champagne cork you got up
and disappeared

Seraphina
here is peace to your soul
a lightyear gone
but not letting go

Then I was at your funeral
with my best friend
at a dive bar in your neighborhood
where all good things come to an end
he told me over and over again
'listen man it might be hard to understand but
don't mourn the dead
celebrate the life they gave'

I replied
'isn't it a shame that we have to go away
when there is still so much that we never got to say?
wouldn't it be nice if we could continue
to the end of the universe and beyond?'

Seraphina
here is peace to your soul
a lightyear gone
but not letting go
put that shuttle in reverse girl---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
