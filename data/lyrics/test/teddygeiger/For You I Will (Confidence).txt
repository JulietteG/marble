Wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair around your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel about you

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
Cannonball into the water
Gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have 
For you I will, for you I will 

Forgive me if I stutter from all of the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes like a waterbed
Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage, I wanna be exposed and not be afraid to fall

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
Cannonball into the water
Gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have 
For you I will
You always want what you can't have, but I've got to try 
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will, for you I will 
For you I will, for you

If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a mood
Yeah, I would
Shout out your name so it echoes in every room
Yeah, that's what I'd do, that's what I'd do
To get to you, yeah

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
Cannonball into the water
Gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have 
For you I will
You always want what you can't have, but I've got to try
Muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will, for you I will 
For you I will, for you I will---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
