Well, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, aint nobodys issue, dont you come around babe cause I dont miss you at all
I aint nobodys problem but my own

Well I found myself a place
every smile that you waste
And every other careless look youve ever tossed aside
Well in my heart I know its true
That I cant go on loving you
And thats the truth It dont feel good, but honey it feels right

Cause, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, aint nobodys issue, dont you come around babe cause I dont miss you at all
I aint nobodys problem but my own

Well of love Ive had my share Ive got plenty of people really who care
At times I might get wicked in my pride
But I smoke that mountain air honey Ive been here, and Ive been there
At times I might get lonely honey I dont cry

Cause, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, aint nobodys issue, dont you come around babe cause I dont miss you at all
I aint nobodys problem but my own

Theres times at night when its cold outside, the moon dont shine, the winds are crying,
I wonder if youre at home you might let me back inside
We can huddle up by the old stove we can kindle up some burned out coals
We can love our selves like the days are warm
But, No no no no no

Cause, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, aint nobodys issue, dont you come around babe cause I dont miss you at all
I aint nobodys problem but my own

Well, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, I aint nobodys problem but my own
Said I, aint nobodys issue, dont you come around babe cause I dont miss you at all
I aint nobodys problem but my own---
