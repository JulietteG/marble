I don't need her money 
I don't need a ride
I got enough connection 
I don't need a piece of her high.

I just want to please her
I just want to squeeze her
I just want to crash her
I just want to trash her

If I could only flag her down
If I could only flag her down

It's not because of her beauty
in a brand new low cut blouse
It's not because she's so snooty
or a fine famed millionaire

It's not 'cause she's in motion
in a brand new cadillac car
It's not because of her lotion
she's a real sweet candy bar

I just want to meet her
I just want to squeeze her---Lyrics submitted by Joe Farmer.
