Shes got legs, she knows how to use them.
She never begs, she knows how to choose them.
Shes holdin leg wonderin how to feel them.
Would you get behind them if you could only find them? 
Shes my baby, shes my baby,

Yeah, its alright.

Shes got hair down to her fanny.
Shes kinda jet set, try undo her panties.
Everytime shes dancin she knows what to do.
Everybody wants to see if she can use it.
Shes so fine, shes all mine,
Girl, you got it right.

Shes got legs, she knows how to use them.
She never begs, she knows how to choose them.
Shes got a dime all of the time,
Stays out at night movin through time.
Oh, I want her, sure, I got to have her,
The girl is alright, shes alright.---Lyrics submitted by Kyle.
