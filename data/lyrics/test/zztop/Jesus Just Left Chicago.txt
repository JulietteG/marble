Jesus just left Chicago,
And He's bound for New Orleans,
Well now, Jesus just left Chicago,
And He's bound for New Orleans.

Workin' from one end to the other,
And all points in between.

Took a jump through Mississippi,
Well, muddy water turned to wine,
Took a jump through Mississippi,
Muddy water turned to wine.

Then I out to California through the forests and the pines,
Oh, take me with You, Jesus.

You might not see him in person,
But he'll see you just the same,
You might not see him in person,
But he'll see you just the same.

You don't have to worry,
'Cause takin' care of business is his name.---Lyrics submitted by riley.
