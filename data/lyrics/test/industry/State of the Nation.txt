I see them marching off to war
They're looking so heroic
I'm told they won't be gone for long
But that's a lie and they know it
Ten thousand gone they won't return
Never to be seen again
Strategic games is all we learn in the end
But they say:

Don't you worry about the situation
(A message from the telephone)
They out there fighting for the state of the nation
(I'm waiting a chance to come home)
They always have to fight the alienation
(I realize I'm fighting alone)

When nightmares memories fades to dust
We'll get back on our feet again
This war has nothing to do with us
But somehow we're still involved in it

Well...

Don't you worry about the situation
(A message from the telephone)
They out there fighting for the state of the nation
(I'm waiting a chance to come home)
Well, Don't you worry about the situation
(A message from the telephone)
They always have to fight the alienation
(I realize I'm fighting alone)

There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place I don't want to be anywhere else

There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place I don't want to be anywhere else

There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place I don't want to be anywhere else

There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place I don't want to be anywhere 

Don't you worry about the situation
They out there fighting for the state of the nation

Don't you worry about the situation
(A message from the telephone)
They always have to fight the alienation
(I realize I'm fighting alone)

They out there fighting for the state of the nation
(I'm waiting a chance to come home)

They always have to fight the alienation
(I realize I'm fighting alone)

There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home---Lyrics submitted by cyrus.
