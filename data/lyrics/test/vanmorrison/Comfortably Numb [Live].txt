There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ships smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I cant hear what youre sayin
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I got that feeling once again
I cant explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ships smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I cant hear what you're sayin
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb---Lyrics submitted by Jeanie.
