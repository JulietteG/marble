I can honestly say
You've been on my mind
Since I woke up today [up today]
I look at your photograph all the time
These memories come back to life
And I don't mind

I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you dance with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember till I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget...
Is goodbye

I woke up this morning and play our song
And through my tears I sang along
I pick up the phone and then,put it down
Cause I know I'm wasting my time....and I don't mind

(repeat chorus except last two words)

Suddenly my cellphone's blowing up with your ringtone
I hesitate to answer it anyway you sound so alone
And I'm surprised to hear you say

You remember when we kissed
You still feel it on your lips
The time that you dance with me with no music playing
You remember the simple things
We talk till we cry
You said that your biggest regret
The one thing you wish I'd forget
Is saying goodbye
Saying goodbye
Goodbye---Lyrics submitted by jelsy.
