It was all story book love, 
Full of things that we dream of 
Filled with fiction, make believe 
You were so one of a kind 
There's no words that could define 
Everything you meant to me 

And girl, I gave my love, I gave my love... 
And you just broke my heart in two, in two... 
And now I gotta start again, again... 
So, baby this must end, girl, this is it 

[Chorus:]
It's officially over, it's officially over 
There ain't nothing you can say that can fix your wrong 
It's officially over, it's officially over 
There ain't nothing you can say that can fix your wrong 
It's officially over... 

You pretended the whole time 
What you told me was a lie 
your info was falsified 

It is too late to shed tears 
Cause there is no love left here 
The only thing left is to say goodbye 

And girl, I gave my love, I gave my love... 
And you just broke my heart in two, in two... 
And now I gotta start again, again... 
So, baby this must end, girl, this is it 

[Chorus]

There's nothing we need to talk about 
And I don't wanna work it out 
Girl, you told me lies, broke me down, wasn't true 
For that reason, girl, I gotta be leaving you 

There's nothing we need to talk about 
And I don't wanna work it out 
I ain't gonna front, girl, you made a grown man cry 
There's only one thing to do... 

[Chorus 2x]---Lyrics submitted by david.
