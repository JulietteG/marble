Hot lava, hot lava
Hot high Lady Lucid, the city

Friar flyer, Im the Nostra-dyme

I cloud all day and night, outta sight
Im miss so-high so I wore some eye wears and tie-dye
Alright, young blood, nice to know ya
Should give my name, if I think ya knew it already
What a brave design, what a time
Ay, Monsieur Im so live and so world-wide

If that's what you know, Wallace, I say yo

When I reach that one, do you wild out?
I suppose I been hot in Europe, yep

When I beat that drum boy, go

He ever got licked, but he never got swallowed
Bitch you know that nigga in the Sugar-Pop lotto
He was on her Twitter, but he never got followed

And umm.. he already know what it does
I got hair for ya nigga, keep it deep in the fuzz
I chat-cheek-cheeky chickle, sip a giggly-grape
Yes I jiggle when I wiggle-shake it, shook up the bait
Best to get her mister, for ya best one do
The jet-setter with the pleasure and the wet pum-poom
The Black-Cherry on her tickle when her breast undo
Ya lick the left on ya gotta lick the right one too, nigga!

Yeah, I'm stylin, a starlet, a scene...
Carve a diamond tiara, pour tea...

Bow-Wow yippee-yo yippee-yay
Poochie, you big dog? Then bite for a taste!
Kitty in many cities, you licking for a lay?
Claiming the big ticket then pay what you say!
Benjis and Euro-izzy, The Yin for the Yang
Touring the world Crazy Make Rottweiler gray
Bottles of Gold frizzy, shes frosty and chaste
Dead doggy-dog belongs in the Grave

If that's what you know, Wallace, I say yo
Come and talk to me, beam me up
When I reach that one, do you wild out?
I suppose I been hot in Europe, yep
Tel Aviv, Istanbul, Seoul, London, Tokyo
