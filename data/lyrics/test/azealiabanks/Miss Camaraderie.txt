Be around to ride with Miss Camaraderie
A sight to see, a sound
What is you with Rottweiler
I'mma let you

Ayo hound, be mild, oh listen lord
I mean, I might've seen, I swore
I saw ya looking, looking all at me
Admiring Amor....
Be idol in my heart, oh be inspiring and more
What kind of wizard? Wh-what a dream!?
A night, a scene, a town, a ride with Miss Camaraderie
An odyssey, oh, wow! Say what?
What is you with Rottweil(er)
I'mma let you, in my house Politer High Society
Attire, tea, a style, look how ya looking, looking now!
Let me see you, see you smile a smiler's sweetest smile
Oh mister wider, me oh wow!
Look how ya looking look wow wow, let me get you

It's the sound, the hip in, hip in, now let me hip you
Hip you hound, get down and get tied up in twine, I'll twist you
Bitch, you found Politer pistol
Pistol Pal

Be around to ride with Miss Camaraderie
An Odyssey, a sound

I mean, I might've seen, I swore

Admiring Amor
Be idol in my heart, oh be inspiring and more
