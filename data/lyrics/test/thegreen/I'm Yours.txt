So girl, what you gonna do
Can't you see that I'm fallin for you
You got me going crazy and you know it's true
Playing silly games without me knowing the rules
Now girl I know you've been a little confused
You can't decide which guy to choose
No other man can love you like I do
And deep inside you know you love me too
I'm yours pretty girl, save me from this world of confusion
Lady, can't you see, you were sent to me for a reason x2
Oh girl, only time will say
Whether or not you chose to swing my way
I'll give you loving each and every day
Make you smile when the clouds are grey
Now girl I'm gonna treat you like a queen
The fact you go the son doesn't change a thing
It's cool with me cos I'll provide for three
Oh baby girl, wont you stay with me
I'm yours pretty girl, save me from this world of confusion
Lady, can't you see, you were sent to me for a reason x2
I'm yours pretty girl, save me from this world of confusion
Lady, can't you see, you were sent to me for a reason x2
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours pretty darling x2---Lyrics submitted by Shawn Yanez.
