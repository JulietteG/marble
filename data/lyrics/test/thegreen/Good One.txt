[Intro: x4]
I woke up in the back of a truck early this morning, yeah
About six thirty  seven o'clock to be exactly, yeah, yeah
I get up, the pain rises, I sit up, I'm so dizzy
What a feeling I've got... Why am I laughing? Why not?

[Chorus: x2]
It must've been a good time, baby, whoa
I hope I didn't get too crazy, whoa lord
I gotta get up and go
'Cause I don't wanna waste any more money
And watch it disappear at the bar

[x4:]
We're gonna have a good, good, good, good one

[Verse 2:]
So I finally get home and I'm floating through the breeze
Barely making it through the door because my body's half asleep
Oh, I'm going out of my head
Roll up a spliff and nice'n up me medi
Light it up, the flame rises, spliff it up, get me dizzy
What a feeling I've got... Why am I laughing? Why not?

[Chorus x2]

[x4:]
We're gonna have a good, good, good, good one---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
