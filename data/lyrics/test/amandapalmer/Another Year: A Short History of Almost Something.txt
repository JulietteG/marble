I tried to fall in it again
My friends took bets and disappeared
They mime their sighing violins
I think I'll wait another year

I want my chest pressed to your chest
My nervous systems interfere
Ten or eleven months at best
I think I'll wait another year

This weather turns my tricks to rust
I am a lousy engineer
The winter makes things hard enough
I think I'll wait another year

Plus I'm only 26 years old
My grandma died at 83
That's lots of time if I don't smoke
I think I'll wait another year

I'm not as callous as you think
I barely breathe when you are near
It's not as bad when I don't drink
I think I'll wait another year

I have my new Bill Hicks CD
I have my friends and my career
I'm getting smaller by degrees
You said you'd help me disappear
But that could take forever
I think I'll wait another year

It'll be the best year ever
I think I'll wait another year
Can't we just wait together
You bring the smokes
I'll bring the beer, oh
I think I'll wait another year---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
