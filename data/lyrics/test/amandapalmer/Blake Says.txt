Blake says no one ever really loved him
They just faked it to get money from the government
And, Blake thinks angels grow when you plant angel dust
He shakes head and blinks his pretty eyes but
Trust me he's no valentine, though he said he would be mine
His heart is in Alaska all the time

Blake stays underwater for the most part
He collects loose change for all tomorrow's parties
And, when Blake dates girls with tattoos of the Pyramids
He breaks their hearts by saying it's not permanent
But in his velvet mind he believes with all his might
We'll all go to Alaska when we die

Blake makes friends but, only for a minute
He prefers the things he orders from the internet
And, Blake's been having trouble with his head again
He takes his pills but, never takes his medicine
He tells me that he's fine, and the sad thing is he's right
And, when it's two o' clock it feels like nine

Blake says he is sorry he got through to me
If it's ok, he'll call right back and talk to the machine
Blake says it looks like acid rain today
He takes the fish inside, he's very kind that way 
But, just like Caroline, he doesn't seem to mind
The globe is getting warmer all the time

It's still cold in Alaska
It's still cold in Alaska---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
