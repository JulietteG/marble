Is it enough to have some love
Small enough to slip inside a book
Small enough to cover with your hand
Because everyone around you wants to look?

Is it enough to have some love
Small enough to slip inside the cracks?
The pieces dont fit together so good
For all the breaking and all the gluing back

And I am still not getting what I want
I want to touch the back of your right arm
I wish you could remind me who I was
Because every day Im a little further off

But you are, my love, the astronaut
Flying in the face of science
I will gladly stay an afterthought
Just bring back some nice reminders

And is it getting harder to pretend
That life goes on without you in the wake?
And can you see the means without the end
In the random frantic action that we take?

And is it getting easy not to care
Despite the many rings around your name?
It isnt funny and it isnt fair
Youve traveled all this way and its the same

But you are, my love, the astronaut
Flying in the face of science
I will gladly stay an afterthought
Just bring back some nice reminders

And I would tell them anything to see you split the evening
But as you see I do not have an awful lot to tell
Everybodys sick for something that they can find fascinating
Everyone but you and even you arent feeling well

But you are, my love, the astronaut
Flying in the face of science
I will gladly stay an afterthought
Just bring back some nice reminders

Yes, you are, my love, the astronaut
Crashing in the name of science
Just my luck, they found your upper half
Its a very nice reminder
Its a very nice reminder

And you may be acquainted with the night
But I have seen the darkness in the day
And you must know it is a terrifying sight
Because you and I are living the same way---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
