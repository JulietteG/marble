I wake up all alone, somewhere unfamiliar.
Been gone so many days, I'm losing count.
When I think of home, I see your face.
I know I have to wait...

(Chorus)
So close, yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do to be there with you
So close yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do to be back with you

I miss hearing your laughter
And all the little things
Forgotten what it's like to hold you
Cause where I am right now so unforgiving
It's numbing everything

So close, yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do to be there with you
So close yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do to be back with you

So promise
No matter how long it takes for me to get back to you
You'll wait for me.

I Promise
No matter how far away I go I'll come back for you
Just wait and see

I miss being at home
I miss your face
Don't think I can wait...

We're So close, yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do to be there with you
So close yet so far
It's tearing me apart
What I would do to be back with you

I promise,
It's tearing me apart
No matter how far away I go I'll come back for you
I promise
It's tearing me apart
What I would do
What I would do
What I would do to be there with you---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
