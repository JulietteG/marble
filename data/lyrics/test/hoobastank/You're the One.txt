Tonight I'm letting go
Of all the old excuses
The fears I built so close
Cause inside I've always known
That no one else could ever do
Or ever feel like home

There's so many things I'll never know
But this I know for sure

You're the one
I need you more than ever
It's taken too long
Taken to long to say

My life began
The night we spent together
Now I cannot live
I'd die any other way

I'm not afraid

You're the one

It's hasn't always been
The best of times
But if you'd ask
I'd do it all again

(Are you ready to begin)

I'm ready to begin
A brand new chapter of our lives
Just tell me where and when

(A brand new chapter in our lives)

Cause there's so many things I'll never know
But this I know for sure

You're the one
I need you more than ever
It's taken too long
Taken too long to say

My life began
The night we spent together
Now I can not live
I'd die any other way
I'm not afraid

You're the one

(Instrumental)

You're the one
Who understands
Who makes me better than I am
I do it all because of you
When all we had
Had come undone
You stood and fought
And didn't run
You're the one who
Pulled us through

You're the one
I feel it more than ever
It's taken too long
Taken too long to say

Our lives began
The night we spent together
Now I can not live
I'd die any other way

I'm not afraid
You're the one---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
