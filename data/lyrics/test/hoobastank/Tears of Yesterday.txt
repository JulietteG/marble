I write your name in my breath on the window
Sit and watch as it fades away
The painful memories
Of the tears of yesterday

The sky is cold and gray
Just like it was when we both went our separate ways
And the rain won't wash away
All the dirt of my mistakes

So I write your name in my breath on the window
Sit and watch as it fades away
The painful memories
Of the tears of yesterday

The deafening sound of rain
Its not enough to drown my thoughts to ease the pain
So instead I'll soak it in
While I stare outside again

And I write your name in my breath on the window
Sit and watch as it fades away
The painful memories
Of the tears of yesterday
I try so hard but I can't seem to let go
I lost so much when you walked away
The painful memories
Of the tears of yesterday

The sun just won't seem to come out
Not since you walked away
Now I cannot escape
I cannot escape the rain
The rain

So I write your name in my breath on the window
Sit and watch as it fades away
The painful memories
Of the tears of yesterday
I try so hard but I can't seem to let go
I lost so much when you walked away
The painful memories
Of the tears of yesterday
Yesterday
Yesterday---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
