Time to get the present situation straight and legit
cause I must have skipped some sh*t
Yo everybody wants a piece of peace
Or a chance at least to see violence cease

(Check it out)
Brothers theyre still out to get you, trust me
Blind as a bat, in fact they must be
Searching for a way to escape from hell, and every minute
They find themselves deeper in it

They say the strong will survive the longest
Still some dont know what makes em strongest
A definite wrong guess if you thinking that money really makes you strong
cause in fact

Its sad and it makes me mad, really mad as hell
cause they buy us with what they sell
Give a mother*cker a car and a chance to make a movie
Suddenly hes a star, it dont move me

School or church cant repair the damage done
To the wealthy the poor dont matter none
To the healthy, the sick are a shame to see
Someone else you dont wanna be

They might as well call this American dream a nightmare
cause once youre up somethins right there
To down you, stress you out, cloud your temple
Complicate a world that was originally simple

Everythings f*cked with,
Now were stuck with spiritual aggravation
Right along with the worlds leading nation
So they say
Leading us and itself the wrong way

No one man you ever saw
Could ever say, and really mean
That hes fully clean
He is a picture they didnt paint
Yo, one simple fact they couldnt take

Even though people weak or strong
Fuss or fight, the simple fact is 
Were all wrong
And were all right, and all righteous
Everybody has a heart and it might just

Take a little time or another rhyme from a brothers mind
To find life for us sublime
Love and hate are extremes with no middle
Most hate the truth and love dreams and riddles

The dream is whatever the scheme is
Winning it all for yourself no matter what the scene is
The truth is, black or white, girl or guy
We all start life the same and all die

Everybody wants the lead or the best
Thinking that the need is cash, f*ck the rest
Im telling you, you need no man teach you
See for yourself, youre a teacher too

Remember when the race of men go
The treesll still grow, the windsll still blow, and yo
Its time all people know
All people come from the womb and end in the tomb

So before you say you know who you are
Or assume, youre brighter or better,
Bigger, smaller  whatever

Yo,you better get it together

Take it to the church

Black is a force to be reckoned with
Black is a force to be seen
Black is a force to be reckoned with
Kno-kno-kno-kno-kno know what I mean

Black is a force to be reckoned with
Black is a force to be seen
Black is a force to be reckoned with
Kno-kno-kno-kno-kno know what I mean

One rhyme can guide mankind like a map
Then again you can make em blind with one rap
My rhymesll guide you just like a shepherd if you were sheep
Or if you was asleep

Yo, I keep close in touch with my brothers
Even if I might sing off or pull string off
A guitar when in a rage on a stage
But I got far, and when I get far and Im paid

Ima bleed and give you lotsa
Me and my way of life, a rasta
Now I gotsta 
Keep on talking and avoiding fools
Punk flights of fancy with the knowledge from school

But could I say watch the teachers
Or could I say you watch the preachers in church on Sunday
Anyway nothing moves the cat
Yeah Im listening but I dont groove to that

Get it together

Know what I mean (repeat 8xs)

Black is force to be reckoned with
Black is a force to be seen
Black is a force to be reckoned with
know what I mean

(repeat and fade)---Lyrics submitted by H.
