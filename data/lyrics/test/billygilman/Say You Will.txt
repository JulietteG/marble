Today when I see your lipstick stain
On my last nice shirt, it cues my brain
To think about you
Every second too

I always knew if I could find a girl
Who sees the way I see the world
I'd give her my life
Will you give me your life?

Say you will
Wade out into the water
Breathe in, breathe out with me
You'd be the words to an unwritten song
I'd be the melody
Don't let your lips be still
Say you will

Picture this
Me and you
Little house with a rim brand hue
Well this country town
As the sun drops down

And on the other side of that window pane
A storm might spin that weather vane
But we can rise above
If you feel my love

Say you will
Wade out into the water
Breathe in, breathe out with me
You'd be the words to an unwritten song
I'd be the melody
Don't let your lips be still

Girl you're my rhapsody
The sound of your symphony
Is a thousand violins

When life's stray stars collide
And with our two hearts tonight
And the circle has no end

Say you will
Wade out into the water
Breathe in, breathe out with me
You'd be the words to an unwritten song
I'd be the melody
Don't let your lips be still

Say you will
Wade out into the water
Breathe in with me (say you will)
I'd be the melody
Don't let your lips be still
Don't let your lips be still
Say you will
Say you will---
