He swallered a frog and hollered yum-yum
He slid down the hillside and darted his tongue
He entered the garden on this bright moonlight night
Then he stopped in his tracks, it was love at first sight

(he said) My skin is black, your skin is green
You dwell in a garden, I live by a stream
Although I'm short and stocky and you're long and lean
I've got a crush on you
Then he squeezed her tighter and tighter and tighter
I've got a crush on you

He said I'm a king snake, and you'll be my queen
With a butler and serpents, and your own private stream
If you refuse me it would be such a shame
Cause I'm so tired of doing my own fang

Then he squeezed her tighter
To excite her and delight her
Oh I've got a crush on you
(and I'll be back tomorrow)

Next day when he got there, a two-legged man
Was holding sweet green thing in his big human hand
A long jet of water shot out of her nose
Ol' king snake had fallen in love with a hose

(he said) My skin is black, your skin is green
You dwell in a garden, I live by a stream
Although You're made of plastic I think you're Fantastic!
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
(but I don't think it's going to work out)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
