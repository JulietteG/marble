I feel like I am running in place
Sometimes I just need a little room to breathe
And I can't run for cover or seek from
Another every little thing I need
I said you're there for the good times and for the bad times
And for the mid tempo days
But there is nothing that I've been through yet 
Where the voice inside of me didn't say

Without you without you there is nothing to hold on to
And the morning won't come without you

I know there's days when I don't try hard enough for you girl
And every moment I can't always be there
And your love that I've been stealing well
I hope you know I'm feeling
That through all this that I really care

I said I move out to the left side
And to the right side or any way that you choose
Because the way that you make me feel
You know I never want to lose

Without you without you there is nothing to hold on to
And the morning won't come without you
(Without you)
(Without You)

Oh when I wake up in the morning baby
And I see you lying next to me
There ain't nothing in the world going to take away my
Pain and come and set me free

Without you without you there is nothing to hold on to
And the morning won't come without you

Without you without you there is nothing to hold on to
And the morning won't come 
No the morning won't come
No the morning is never really going to come
Without you---Lyrics submitted by shawn.
