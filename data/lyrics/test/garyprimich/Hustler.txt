Im your hustler baby
Let me play it straight pool with you
Im your hustler baby
Let me play straight pool with you
Ill bank my 8-ball in your little ole pocket
Any way you want me to.

Rack yourself now little girl
I will take my queue
Im gonna run your table
All night before were through
Im your hustler baby
Let me play straight pool with you
Ill bank my 8-ball in your little ole pocket
Any way you want me to.

(guitar solo)

Now I run with Luther Wimpy
Minnesota Fats, Jackie Gleason
They aint where Im at
Im your hustler baby
Let me play straight pool with you
Ill bank my 8-ball in your little ole pocket
Any way you want me to.

Now my game is not one pocket
My game is not pea pool
My game is better than a government check
Youre sure to think its cool
Im your hustler baby
Let me play straight pool with you
Ill bank my 8-ball in your little ole pocket
Any way you want me to.
(Thats right, baby!) 

(harp solo  ending)
