It's a disease, this is a wrecking ball, waiting in line
It's a disease, we're all waiting in line
It's life spent putting holes through the hearts of buildings

There was a man back there on his hands and knees
In a confident voice he said he was dying
He breathes in toxins as a breath of fresh air
He was wearing a brand new suit

Your glass body will self destruct in time
For everyone to see right through you
No one's home, no one's home, leave a note that won't be answered
I should've known

It's a battle against the reflection
Your framework is crumbling to the ground
It's a battle against the reflection
Your fingerprints are ghosts among us

Your glass body will self destruct in time
For everyone to see right through you,
For everyone, for everyone to see right through you
No one's home, no one's home, leave a note that won't be answered
I should've known (i should've known)

Your glass body will self destruct in time
For everyone to see right through you
It's a battle against the reflection
Your framework is crumbling to the ground
It's a battle against the reflection
Your fingerprints are ghosts among us

There was a man back there on his hands and knees
In a confident voice he said he was dying
He breathes in toxins as a breath of fresh air
He was wearing a brand new suit

(I should've known)
(I should've known)

Without your own skin you're living inside out
You're living in a body with no lungs to breathe for itself
So speak for yourself
You're living in a body with no lungs to breathe for itself
So speak for yourself (yourself), breathe for yourself---Lyrics submitted by John.
