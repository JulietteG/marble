Heres another morning 
Where I cant decide to sleep or stay awake
And I'm tangled up in thoughts 
Thoughts of how we fell apart I tried to make it work but all you did was make it worse
And all youve done is leave me hopeless

Ever since that day you made those feelings go away and 
Ive needed someone to show me that
That theres a reason to love
That theres a reason to love again

Even with a warning I couldnt have fixed us to save my life
Its hard when youre alone to pick up the pieces
I tried to make it work but all you did was make it worse And all youve done is leave me hopeless

Ever since that day you made those feelings go away and Ive needed someone to show me that
That theres a reason to love 
That theres a reason to love again

I need someone to prove to me that love is more than just a tragic catastrophe (catastrophe)
That sucks the life out of me and brings me down cause all youve done is leave me hopeless 

Ever since that day you made those feelings go away and Ive needed someone to show me that
That theres a reason to love 
That theres a reason to love again (Ive need someone to show me that)That theres a reason to love
That theres a reason to love again---Lyrics submitted by anna tiberio.
