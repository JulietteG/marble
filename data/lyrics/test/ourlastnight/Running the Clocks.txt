the stars were bright before we got here
but our choices sent them into the darkness

before we know it, they will be reunited
and looking for revenge

if i could run the clocks, i would
but their hands are out of mine
their hands are out of mine
i told them to turn around
but the future was on their minds
it was on their minds

the stars were safe before we got here
but our attraction brought them to the ground

before we know it, they will be reunited
and looking for revenge

if i could run the clocks, i would
but their hands are out of mine
their hands are out of mine
i told them to turn around
but the future was on their minds
it was on their minds

this can't amount to much of anything
this can't amount to much of anything
this is the part we wait for and we need to close our eyes
this is the part we wait for and we need to close our eyes
i'm nauseous thinking about the possibilities
not even the greatest astronomers could explain this

if i could run the clocks, i would
but their hands are out of mine
their hands are out of mine
i told them to turn around
but the future was on their minds
it was on their minds

if i could run the clocks, i would
but their hands are out of mine
if i could run the clocks, i would
but their hands are out of mine---Lyrics submitted by John.
