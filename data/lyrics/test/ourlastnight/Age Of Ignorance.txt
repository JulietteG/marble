They murdered their own to start an endless war; 
Sat back and relaxed as the buildings burned. 
This is the age of ignorance, 
It is a sickness that brings us to the end. 

They poison our food to keep their margins high, 
And as they count their money, the starving die. 
This is the age of ignorance, 
It is a sickness that brings us to the end. 

It's time to stand up, get ready to fight, 
For all the wrongs that should be right. 
Or watch the world as it slowly falls apart. 

They could cure this cancer in the simplest ways; 
But the longer we're sick, the more the doctor gets paid. 
The longer we wait to get out of these days, 
The shorter we'll live and the faster we'll decay. 
This is the age of ignorance, 
It is a sickness that brings us to the end. 

It's time to stand up, get ready to fight, 
For all the wrongs that should be right. 
Or watch the world as it slowly falls apart. 

If the people lead, 
The leaders will follow. 
The teachers will be the ones 
That never played this game. 

This is the age of ignorance, 
It is a sickness that brings us to the end. 

It's time to stand up; get ready to fight, 
For all the wrongs that should be right, 
Or watch the world as it slowly falls apart. 

We'll stand up for what we believe in, 
And won't back down till we see the reason 
To change the world before it slowly falls apart.---Lyrics submitted by pali.
