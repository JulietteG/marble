She closes her eyes,
Yet tries to look around
There's nothing to hear, 
There's nothing to see
She's all alone and no matter what 
This cannot be changed
This cannot be changed

The shadows she chases may lead her in 
Different directions

But she's unable to move
The place she ounce tried to dream of is still there
But she no longer tries

Everything she ounce had is now only everything 
She ounce forgot

In her mind 
This reality fails 
To reveal itself
(day by day she repeats to herself just how much she has done)
Just how much she has done
And eventually 
Her perception becomes a hope
That brushes the empty canvas 
She is waiting in
(but this picture) 
But this picture is not sincere 
Picture is not sincere

Everything she ounce had is now only everything
She ounce forgot

And the shades of gray 
Reveal the fragile hope
That this scene was built of

Words can bring her back 
But it's hard when she's not listening
Silence can bring her back 
But only if she knows it's not here

Time can bring her back
But it goes so slowly without her...---Lyrics submitted by !abby!.
