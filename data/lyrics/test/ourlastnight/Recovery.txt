Your shadows are back from the dead
Creeping over the hills
And making their name
They leave you lifeless, they leave you

Don't let them make your choices
Take control,
Take control and ignore their every word
Your skin is tougher than your bones

Recovery, recovery she always means well
Recovery, uncover this for me yeah
I can see it in her eyes
Reaching out for a helping hand
Take my hand and take my word

Help is on its way, just breathe slowly
Trust the medic because he has
Everything you'll need

This can't be right,
The signs point east but we're going west
As long as you're not heading the way you came
When the past gets left behind
Please let this be the turning point
When the past gets left behind
Please let this be the turning point,
The turning point!

Your shadows are back from the dead (the dead)
Creeping over the hills
And making their name
They leave you lifeless, they leave you lifeless

Recovery, recovery she always means well
Recovery, uncover this for me yeah
I can see it in her eyes
Reaching out for a helping hand
Take my hand and take my word

Send, send a signal to the ones you love
Because help is on its way
Your shadows are back from the dead,
They're back from the dead

Why can't we get this right? why?
Why can't we get this right? why? why?
Send a signal---Lyrics submitted by John.
