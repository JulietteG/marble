Never ever before
Has a colorful world
Held a colorful girl like you
You gotta fly
Never ever have I
Been just black or just white
All this freedom and flight has got me feeling high
Never have I ever felt like this before
Ive never been the one to knock but now Im at your door
Well listen very closely you can hear the sound
Of a love that makes my heart beat and my head spin round
head spin round, spin round, spin round, spin round, round, round
I spin round, I spin round, I spin round
(Lets all just turn into pure light)
A passion runs from my heart
The room is spinning to red
The blood is leaving my head
Youre such a chemical
It feels like fire and ice
You bring my body to life


Bouncing into the night just like a butterfly
Never have I ever felt like this before
Ive never been the one to knock but now Im at your door
Well listen very closely you can hear the sound
Of a love that makes my heart beat and my head spin round
head spin round, spin round, spin round, spin round, round, round
I spin round, I spin round, I spin round
Never have I ever felt like this before
Ive never been the one to knock but now Im at your door
Listen very closely you can hear the sound
Of a love that makes my heart beat and my head spin round
Never have I ever felt like this before (this before)
Ive never been the one to knock but now Im at your door (at your door)
Well listen very closely you can hear the sound (hear the sound)
Of a love that makes my heart beat and my head spin round
Head spin round, (spin round) spin round, (spin round) spin round, (spin round) spin round, round, round (spin round)
I spin round (spin round), I spin round (spin round), I spin round---Lyrics submitted by maurissa.
