My granddaddy ran moonshine
Till the day he died
Left behind his children
And a 45
Well that outlaw stuff
Runs through my blood
I was raised to be tough
I was born to run

I'm the daughter of southern ground
It's who I am and I won't slow down
I was taught to

Fight like hell
And love like an angel
Pray like a saint
And run like a rebel
Live each day like there's no tomorrow
Speak my mind
And act like a lady
I'll always be my mama's baby
And you can't ever tell me nothing
Oh, loving a girl like me
Ain't easy

Well I don't belong
In one place too long
I gotta keep moving
But you can come along
Well if you don't mind
Baby hold on tight
Cause this life I'm living
Is one crazy ride

I'm the daughter of southern ground
It's who I am and I won't slow down
I was taught to

Fight like hell
And love like an angel
Pray like a saint
And run like a rebel
Live each day like there's no tomorrow
Speak my mind
And act like a lady
I'll always be my mama's baby
And you can't ever tell me nothing
Oh, loving a girl like me
Ain't easy

If you keep up with me
I promise I'll never leave

I'll fight like hell
Love like an angel
Pray like a saint
And run like a rebel
Live each day like there's no tomorrow
Speak my mind
And act like a lady
I'll always be my mama's baby
And you can't ever tell me nothing
Oh, loving a girl like me
Ain't easy

My granddaddy ran moonshine
Till the day he died
Left behind his children
And a 45---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
