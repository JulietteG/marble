No one can blow the shows
Or throw the bones that break your nose like I can
But the men that fall so deep
In love they start to weep themselves to sleep can

And then he'll fight the world
And love the girl that tried to hold her hands behind them
They won't be left behind
By time or any rules that try to bind them

Nobody knows just how it goes
To show that the villain will play the victim
The kings can check the reigns
And deem the knives of brains that mean to kill them---
