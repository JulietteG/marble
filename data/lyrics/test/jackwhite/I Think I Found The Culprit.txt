I think I found the culprit
Looks like you, it must be you
Ain't found nothing better yet
What's the matter with you, you got nothing to do?

Two crumbs on my window sill
Two birds sitting there perfectly still
One of them up to no good
The other one doing what he totally should

I think I found the culprit
Looks like you, it must be you
Ain't found nothing better yet
What's the matter with you, you got nothing to do?

Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun

I think I found the culprit
Looks like you, it must be you
Ain't found nothing better yet
What's the matter with you, you got nothing to do?

Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
