Well I get into the game, but it's always the same
I'm the man with the name, Hip Eponymous Poor Boy, boy
Call me whatever you may, I ain't stoppin' the train
I got a pill for the pain, Hip Eponymous Poor Boy, boy

And I know that I can't defeat you
Yea, you don't worry now, I ain't going to preach to you
Well, there you go
But I'll be going right there with you
Yeah wherever you'll be, you'll be lookin' at me

But don't get out of your chair
Put a bow in your hair, you might be makin' 'em stare
So leave the care to the poor boy, the poor boy
And that's the name of the game
Keep on stayin' the same, ain't nobody to blame
Nobody but the poor boy, the poor boy

Well okay, so you feel asleep today
What's funny to me though is that you did that yesterday
You must think I'm mad
To do all the things that I don't need to do
But while you're laughin' at me, well I'll be laughin' at you

So I get into the game, but always keep it the same
And I'll be usin' your name, but they'll be yellin' at me "Poor boy, poor boy"
But I'll be happy for you, cause you got nothin' to do
And I'll be singin' the blues, walkin' around singin' "Poor boy, poor boy"

Sometimes a cold shiver comes over me
And it turns me on when the song takes over me
But alright, I can't fight if the odds are against me
But I can't sit still
Because I know that I will

And you'll be watching me girl, takin' over the world
Let the stripes unfurl, gettin' rich singin' "Poor boy, poor boy"
And I'll be comin' to play, I do it every day
And the title will stay, Hip Eponymous Poor Boy, poor boy (Yeah)---
