I know the player
With the slick
Trigger finger
For Her Majesty
Another one
With the
Golden tone voice
And then your fantasy
Another bill
From a killer
Turned a thrill
Into a tragedy

Chorus
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just
Another way to die

Another tricky little gun
Giving solace to the one
That will never see
The sunshine
Another inch of your life
Sacrificed
For your brother
In the nick of time
Another dirty money, 
Heaven sent honey
Turning on a dime
Chorus
A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can
Trust is just
Another way to die

Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oah! 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 

Another girl
With her finger
On the world singing
To you what 
You want to hear
Another gun thrown down
And surrendered
Took away your fear
Hey! 
Another man
That stands right
Behind you
Looking in the mirror

Chorus
Oh, a door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Oh, 
Someone that you think
That you can trust
Is just another way to die---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
