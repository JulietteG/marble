Cocaine conversations
Cocaine conversations,
While there children play next door
Hearts fallin to the floor
and I dreamed I knew you in the night 
fallin while you slept on through it
And I dreamed inside your mine
Drink and drink and drink and drink
Livin in Amnesia Valley
Eyes like windows light the night
Livin in Amenisa Valley
Dont even talk a good game
Dont even talk
You know that its so easy
To cover up the the holes
To go on livin this way
Hide from what you dont know
Livin in Amnesia Valley
Eyes like Windows light the night
Livin Amnesia Valley
Dont even talk a good game
Dont even talk
Is there nothing left in sight?
Is there nothing left in sight?
Cocaine Conversations
Dont even talk a good game
Dont even talk a good game
Livin in Amnesia Valley
Eyes like windows light the night
Dont even talk a good game
Dont even talk a good game
Is there nothing left in sight?
Is there nothing left in sight?

So damn keep on takin
there in the same way
your mind will keep on workin 
with the chips and lathe
Well damn keep on takin
Stealin, thinkin, 
your mind keeps workin in the same way
Eyes like windows light the night
Eyes like windows light the night
Cocaine conversations
Cocaine conversations
Dont even talk a good game
Dont even talk a good game---Lyrics submitted by Alyssa.
