There's something strange going on in my head
that says if i were to get in a care right now
well carolina's where i would end
and to your door step i would be bound
to whisper the words that i've always wanted to say
then watch as the sun rips this blue sky away.
Cause the colors are always changing as you stare up at the clouds
and at least you know you're always looking up.

So Casey, can you remember sitting by my side
on the bank of the delaware river, talking about life?

Don't forget about the blue sky,
sunrise,
and all the space between.
It's amazing how a girl like you
could effect a guy like me.
All the pictures, memories and all the time we had
do you think that somethings are better left unsaid?

We'd stay stuck inside just to watch the time go by
and sleep the whole day till the night
With everything you said. 
I'm sure you've got some place 
that you'd probably rather be
I hope you're singing this song and thinking about me.

Carolina, 
Is waiting for you
it's what you've always wanted.

Don't forget about the blue skies, sunrise, and all the space between
It's amazing how a girl like you could affect a guy like me
With the pictures, memories and all the times we had
Do you think that some things are better left unsaid?

And we run away 
because the sky looks different
when you're in another state.
It's everything I've always wanted,
everything I've worked so hard for.
Well, is it me
to put bottle down?
Well, is it in me
to put the bottle down?

Well is it in me
to put the bottle down?
Well is it in me 
to put the bottle down?
Is it in me?
Is it in me?---Lyrics submitted by case.
