Verse 1:
Standin' out in the rain
I've got nowhere I can run
My woman done left me
I've got nowhere I can turn
My hearts full of pain ( oh nah)
And I'm standing in the rain
(standin' in the rain)

(musical break)

Verse 2: 
I'm driving down a Lonely Road
That never seems to end
Everytime I turn around
I'm in the same situation again
My hearts full of pain(oh nah)
Aand I'm standing in the rain

(musical break)

Repeat Verse 2---Lyrics submitted by Schuyler Taylor.
