She's not coming home tonight  
she says that she's left forever.  
And you're staying in the house  
where she's going to live forever.  

And the memory is cruel  
it reminds there's no one new  
time is nothing but a lie  
if she's not coming home tonight.  
And your sleep will never be as good as it used to be  
when the one you love is gone,  
when the one you love is gone.  

Dadarada...  

While you're waiting for the sun  
the space around you is very quiet.  
So you breath in, close your eyes  
you can feel her warmth inviting you to dance...  
she's cruel, she reminds there's no one new  
time is nothing but a lie if she's not coming home tonight.  
And your sleep will never be as good as it used to be  
when the one you love is gone,  
when the one you love is gone.  

Dadarada...---Lyrics submitted by Rex Tsai.
