I am one of seven brothers.
Five of us must leave and start again.
In this land of Saints and Martyrs,
Tears of sadness hide within the rain.

So fare thee well, Remember me...
Sail from the Harbour of Tears

I can hear my father calling
'Godspeed, my son,
wherever you may go'
He looked so small
down on the quayside.
A man I guess
I'll never really know.

Goodbye, lad... I'll miss you,
though I don't show it.
I am a farmer of the land,
I'm not a man of words.
Forgive me my failing,
you never knew me.
Godspeed wherever you may go...

So fare thee well,
Remember me...
