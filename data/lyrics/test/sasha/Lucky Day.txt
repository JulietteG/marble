You're looking lost and I don't know the reason
All that I know is that you should not be
Don't run away the time is now the place is here

Don't hesitate, for this is very urgent
I'm in a state in which I should not be
It's up to you, to let a minute save your day

Show me what you got, I know you've got a lot
So don't you let it slip away
Just show me what it takes to hold you, maybe no one told you
Trust me when I say
Today's your lucky day
Today's your lucky day

Dear Diary, I'm on my way to madness
She don't belong to mediocrity
I'll let her know, that I have never been so sure

Show me what you got, I know you've got a lot
So don't you let it slip away
Come on show me what it takes to hold you, maybe no one told you
Trust me when I say
Today's your lucky day

Don't get me wrong (don't get me wrong)
I'm not in love (not completely)
But if you want (but if you want)
We'll carry on (we'll carry on)
and on....

Show me what you got, I know you've got a lot
So don't you let it slip away
Come on show me what it takes to hold you, maybe no one told you
Trust me when I say

Come on show me what you got, I know you've got a lot
So don't you let it slip away
Just show me what it takes to hold you, maybe no one told you
Trust me when I say
Today's your lucky day
It's your lucky day
So trust me when I say
Today's your lucky day ---Lyrics submitted by tung chou.
