I couldn't see paradise right before my eyes
And when I had you here by my side
I didn't know that no one else could ever take your place
But now I know
I know that I should have stayed
And seeing you tonight
I only wonder why
I ever said goodbye

Any other fool would never walk away
Even a fool would still be there holding you
Any other fool would know I never should have let you go
I had it all as any fool could see
Any other fool but me

Any one else never would have let the feeling die
Any one else would have fought to keep it alive
If they were in my shoes
They'd know the love we had was love too good to lose

Any other fool would never walk away
Even a fool would still be there holding you
Any other fool would know I never should have let you go
I had it all when you were loving me
I had it all as any fool could see
Any other fool but me

I had it all when you were loving me (had all the love I ever need)
I had it all as any fool could see (any other fool but me)

Any other fool would never walk away (any other fool)
Even a fool would still be there holding you
Any other fool would know I never should have let you go
I had it all as any fool could see
Any other fool but me

Any other fool but me

Even a fool would still be there holding you
Any other fool would know I never should have let you go
I had it all as any fool could see
Any other fool but me---Lyrics submitted by ken henderson.
