I love when you pulling up in your jeep
Bumping all your beats
Js on
With your shades on
Just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets
But when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing no oh

So I hop up in your ride
Ooh it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down
With the doors off
With your hand on my thigh
Drive slow ooh
Take your time

Every little thing you do got me feeling some type away (away)
When you gimme that thunder you make my summer rain
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) [2x]
Everyday, everyday

[2x]
And it won't stop
Oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Yeah

With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop
Oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I love when we pulling up to the beach
Sand down to my feet
Sun down
Nobody around
That's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body, (rock, rock the boat Aaliyah)
Don't it sound familiar?

'Cause it feels like ah ah aye aye
Looking up in space
It's just me and my ba-ae
And it feels so amazing
Oh oh
All night
Ooh ooh ooh

Every little thing you do got me feeling some type away (away)
When you gimme that thunder you make my summer rain
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) [2x]
Everyday, everyday

[2x]
And it won't stop
Oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Yeah

With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat
On repeat
And it won't stop
Oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Everyday, everyday
I can't breathe
You take my breath away from me
Here's my heart
You got the key
Put that on eternity
I love you 'til infinity
Infinity [4x]

My babe
My everything
And when I think about it
Don't be making me wait baby

It won't ever stop
My heart won't skip a beat baby
And it'll keep going on [5x]

[2x]
And it won't stop
Oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Yeah

With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat
On repeat
And it won't stop
Oh oh oh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ---Lyrics submitted by Dana Garfield.
