Oh, I think I might need a cigarette
Cause we be off and then we on again
I just don't get it, don't know why we do this, why we do this for
One day we be in the Cadillac, I be riding with my seat laid back
Next day I be breaking all your windows
Keying up your doors

Don't know how you do
To me, what you do
But baby, ooh you
You do it so good
And yeah we break up
I break all your stuff
That's just how we love
We keep it so hood

How you make me feel, can't nobody do that for me
And we go through some things
But I can't stop loving you
And oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
The way my body feels when you laying right beside me
Boy I'ma be right here
Don't care what nobody say
Cause oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it

Oh, I know I be catching attitudes
Throwing things and getting mad at you
Yea it's crazy, but it's in the name of, in the name of love
And sometimes you be getting on my nerves
Saying I hate you but that sh*t don't work
And every time we say we through with it
We back in love again

Don't know how you do
To me, what you do
But baby, ooh you
You do it so good
And yeah we break up
I break all your stuff
That's just how we love
We keep it so hood

How you make me feel, can't nobody do that for me
And we go through some things
But I can't stop loving you
And oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
The way my body feels when you laying right beside me
Boy I'ma be right here
Don't care what nobody say
Cause oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it

If you call yo man yo boo
And you like and love him too
Say "I like it"
If he give it to you good
And he keeps that loving hood
Say "I like it"

I like it
I like the way you kiss me baby
I like it

How you make me feel, can't nobody do that for me
And we go through some things
But I can't stop loving you
And oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
The way my body feels when you laying right beside me
Boy I'ma be right here
Don't care what nobody say
Cause oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it
Oh I like it, I like it

Do me baby
Do me baby
Way, way
Ooh I like the way ---Lyrics submitted by Tejia Gilford.
