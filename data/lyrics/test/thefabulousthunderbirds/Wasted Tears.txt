My wasted tears they fall like rain, and my heart is in pain,
Shes been gone two weeks, seems like years 
Since Ive been crying these wasted tears, my wasted tears
She said goodbye, I said so long
I guess I brought this on my own
Just one phone, knowing that you were near
Might just dry up these wasted tears, my wasted tears
Wed been together a long long time,
Everything seem to be fine, now shes gone and Im to blame
Now Im crying
So life goes on, I must say
 Everyday is payday and Ive got to pay and pay and pay
Ive realized my worst fears, now Im drowning in wasted tears my wasted tears
Wed been together a long long time,
Everything seem to be fine, now shes gone, shes gone  and Im to blame
Now Im crying
So life go on I must say
Everyday is payday and Ive got to pay and pay and pay
Ive realized my worst fears, now Im drowning in wasted tears my wasted tears
My wasted tears, my wasted tears my wasted tears---Lyrics submitted by Susan Foxx.
