Better ask my momma how to make a monster... I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon, I'm a beautiful monster from outer space, too, learned how to shake my hips in the inner sanctum, satan gave me tips and then i thanked him, I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon
black black, black black leather, smash smash, black black leather, kill kill, black black leather, crash crash, black black leather, I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon I'm a chicken-fried fire-eatin' son of a gun, concieved by my devil daddy on a chicken run,like a fireball flyin' down thunder road, daddy made mama but she shoulda said no, I'm the raw Hyde monster they named number 1 I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon, I'm a genuine juvenille delinquent from the moon, I'm like a hundred billion hydrogen bombs, mama wanted a goat, but I got mom's, I'm the creature from the black leather lagoon---
