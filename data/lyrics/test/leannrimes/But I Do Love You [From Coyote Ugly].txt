I don't like to be alone in the night
and i dont like to hear i'm wrong when i'm right
and i dont like to have the rain on my shoes
but i do love you
but i do love you

I dont like to see the sky painted grey
and i dont like when nothings goin my way
and i dont like to be the one with the blues
but i do love you
but i do love you

love everything about the way your loving me
the way u lay ur head upon my shoulder when you sleep
and i love to kiss you in the rain
i love everythin you do
oh I do

I dont like to turn the radio on
just to find i missed my favourite song
and i dont like to be the last with the news
but i do love you
but i do love you

love everything bout the way your loving me
the way you lay ur head upon my shoulder when you sleep
and i love to kiss you in the rain
i love everythin you do
oh i do

i dont like to be alone in the night
and i dont like to hear i'm wrong when i'm right
and i dont like to  have the rain on my shoes
but i do love you 
but i do love you
but i do love you
but i do love yPr---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
