I dont like to be alone in
the night
and i don't like to hear
Im wrong when im right 
and i don't like to have
the rain on my shoes
but i do...
love you
but i do love you 

I don't like to see the
sky painted grey
And i don't like when
nothing's going my way
And i don't like to 
be the one with the blues
but i do...
love you
but i do love you

Love everything
about the way
you're loving me...
The way you 
lay your head 
upon
my shoulder when 
you sleep...

And i love to 
kiss you in the 
rain
i love everything
you do, oh i do

And i don't like to
turn the radio on
just to find i missed 
my favorite song
and i don't like to be
the last with the news
but i do love you
but i do love you

love everything 
about the way 
you're loving me...
The way you 
lay your head
upon
my shoulder when
you sleep.

and i love to
kiss you in the
rain
i love everything 
you do, oh i do

I don't like to be alone in
the night
and i don't like to hear 
i'm wrong when im right
and i dont like to have
the rain on my shoes 
but i do love you
but i do love you

But i do 
love you
but i do love you---Lyrics submitted by Erica.
