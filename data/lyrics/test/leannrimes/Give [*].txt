Everybody's reachin' for somethin'.
Everyday pullin' and tuggin'.
And always wantin' a little more.
Holdin' onto hurt like an anchor.
Treatin' those we love like strangers.
Takin' names and keepin' score.
We all know, what were really after.
Somewhere along the road, 
we got it backwards.

(Chorus)
If you want to get love then give it.
If you want to feel some forgiveness,
Then you've gotta let go,
and do some forgiving of your own.
If you want a freind then be one.
A little bit of kindness, show some.
You'll be surprised of how much,
finds its way back home.
It don't matter what it is.
If you want it, Give.

I've been down right stubborn,
At one time or another.
And found it easier to bend.
I've had a shoulder to lean on.
Been the one who got to be strong.
And peace was waiting at both ends.
I've felt the Power. 
I've seen what it can do.
It seemed so simple.
So simple that it's true.

(Chorus)

Oh yeah.
If you want a friend, then be one
A little bit of kindness, show some
You'll be surprised of how much, 
finds it's way back home.
It don't matter what it is.
If you want it, Give. Yeah

Oh show a little kindness baby
oh oooh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Karanaya.
