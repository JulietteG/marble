A long time forgotten the dreams that just fell by the way
The good life he promised ain't what she's livin' today
But she never complains about the bad times or the bad things he's done, lord
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come

Yeah she's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man 
She loves him in spite of his wicked ways that she don't understand
Oh with teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world hand in hand
She's a good hearted womanlovin' a good timin' man

He likes the bright lights and night life and good timin' friends
When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can lord
She's a good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man

Oh, I'm a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
Yeah and I love him in spite of his wicked ways that I'll never understand
With teardrops and laughter we'll pass through this world hand in hand
I'm a good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man yeah

Oh with teardrops and laughter we'll pass through this world hand in hand And I'm a good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man
I'm just a good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man---Lyrics submitted by Leona Taylor.
