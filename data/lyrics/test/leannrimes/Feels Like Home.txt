In your eyes
I found the answers
to my questions

In your arms yeah
I found the world
I`ve waited for
In your touch

Found everything
I ever needed
I need nothing more
Always dreamed of the day

When my dream would find me
Now my dream`s beside me
You are in my life
In your arms

I know where I belong
I`ve never known
this feeling oh
But it feels like home

In your eyes
I know what I can be
You opened up your heart to me
And it feels like home

When I`m with you baby
it feels like home
All this time
When there was not

much to believe in
I kept my faith yeah
That you were waiting
there for me

I searched this world
And now my search
is finally over
Found the one I need

Always hoped for the day
When my heart would find you
Now my heart`s beside you
You are in my life

In your arms
I know where I belong
I`ve never known
this feeling oh

But it feels like home
In your eyes
I know what I can be
You opened up your heart to me

And it feels like home
Doesn`t matter where I`ve been
or what I`ve been through
`Cause I know I`ve been

waiting everyday of my life
To be with you
To be with you ooh oh
In your arms

I know where I belong
I`ve never known
this feeling oh
But it feels like home

In your eyes
I know what I can be
You opened up your heart to me
And it feels like home

When I`m with you baby
it feels like home
When I`m with you baby
it feels like home

Feels like feels like
feels like feels like home
It feels like home oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
