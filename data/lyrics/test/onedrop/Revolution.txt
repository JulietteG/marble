I traveled the roads on my own
And passed the signs of cross and bones
I found away when they said no
You've got to take control, you've got to take control

Start a revolution
Right your constitution
Take control, take control, take control

You decide what's best for you and only you
No other should control you
Not even a system of majority
It's alright to question your authority

Start a revolution
Right your constitution
Take control take control take control

Control your destiny, pave your own road
Do what feels right, not what your told
But with no effort to make a change
There's no right to complain
Your to blame

Start a revolution
Right your constitution
Take control take control take control---Lyrics submitted by Nicolas.
