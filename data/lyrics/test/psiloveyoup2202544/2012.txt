Will we ever live to see our dreams
Lock of curly hair where I sleep
Even though I think they're pretty neat
Forget it well never live to see our dreams
Where will you be when they count the clock in 2012
Ill probably be asleep Will you be with me or inside the crowd
In this light I get to see my breath
In this lit mirror I can see my death
Where will you be Where
Forget it
It was over before it began
Where will you be when they count the clock in 2012
Probably be asleep Wont be with me---Lyrics submitted by armoftheland.
