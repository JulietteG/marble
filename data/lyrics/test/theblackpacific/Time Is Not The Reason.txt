I'm going blind - but you know
I can change my situation
I won't try - and you know
Won't fall back in your world
Time is not the enemy - Time is not the reason
Don't need no second chance
Now I got a reason to give up the enemy
won't change my circumstance

And I won't follow - Now my time has come
I control my destiny

Now my time has come 
I got something to belive in
Now my time has come - had enough I'm getting even

I defy - control
I don't need your aggravation
It's my time - and you know
Can't hold me back again
Now I got an enemy I don't need a reason
Don't hear a word you say
Now I got a reason to staring right in front of me
Don't tell me what I'll get---Lyrics submitted by b.
