Fame fatal fame - it'll rot your brain
Ruin your good name
Take money for your shame
And we're all entertained - What can you do?
Greed - give me greed- More than I will need
In contracts and schemes
we're flooding the machine
With cheap goods from the Phillipines
What can you do?

Love for money - it leaves you in the end
Fat cats and beggars - they all will toil in vain 
Give me nothing - but a tall glass and this refrain
We are all to blame - What can you do?

Lies tell me lies - cover up my eyes
You wear a cheap disguise
When profits are the style
And we'll choke on our denial - what can you do?---Lyrics submitted by b.
