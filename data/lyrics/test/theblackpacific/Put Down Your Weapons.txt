Your fake smiles strike right through my heart
Mine's so bruised up I'm seeing stars
Your guns are cleaned your arrows drawn
I take cover when you lead me on

Take one shot in your mirror
or kill me before the bleeding starts
The words you said they 
shot me straight through the heart 
Put down your weapons - before they tear us apart
I should have know it - known it right from the start
Put down your weapons before they tear us apart

I see you sharpen up your knives
I'm bloodied up but I'm still alive
With one eye closed you just can't see
Your arrows bounce right off of me
Take one shot in your mirror
Or kill me before the bleeding starts---Lyrics submitted by b.
