I try so hard but I cant gain ground
To bring back the love thats crumbing down.
Theres so little time as I search my mind
To think of new ways of amusing you.
Im losing you!

I wake up each day and wear a new face
And make conversation that my suit your taste.
Then I mention a few of the good times we knew 
But each thing I say is infusing you.
Im losing you!

Ill be anything that you want me to be
Like clay in your hands, you can mold me.
So bring back your love cause I find it so hard
To except what your eyes have told me.

I whisper I love you and get no reply
And each time you kiss me it feels like goodbye.
Though its hard to believe you want me to leave.
What good can I do by refusing to?
Im losing you!

What more can I do?
Im losing you!---Lyrics submitted by Chris Pimble.
