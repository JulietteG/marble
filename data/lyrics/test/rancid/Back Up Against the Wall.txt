Rock gets hot, now she cant stop
Shes a lot, a lot like a robot
And she cant be bought, and her nerves are shot
And she starts to rot, from the inside out
She said I dont need you to save me, but theres people here trying to blame me
And theres no jobs that will pay me, enough to feed my family

And I got my back up against the wall 
And I got my back up against the wall 
And no one hears her call 
Cause theres no one there at all
And I got my back up against the wall 

Alarm clock ring on, fools are chipping
Promises are broken, yeh, jobs are leaving
And the sky is darkening in the land of stepping
But the bus is staying and I wont be regretting
And theres no more jobs here, no more love here
No more room here for me, and theres no more jobs here
Only misery here, for me and my family

And I got my back up against the wall 
And I got my back up against the wall 
And no one hears her call 
Cause theres no one there at all
And I got my back up against the wall 

Now where have all the good times gone
(ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT!)
But something here is going wrong
(ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT)

Why even bother, when you getting clobbered
Nowhere is safe and sound, off the sweat they will profit
Your getting robbed and their gunning you down to the ground
Oh we all got big dreams now, the new factory just shut down
And theres not enough to go around, cause their gunning you down to the ground

And I got my back up against the wall 
And I got my back up against the wall 
And no one hears her call 
Cause theres no one there at all
And I got my back up against the wall---Lyrics submitted by sonya.
