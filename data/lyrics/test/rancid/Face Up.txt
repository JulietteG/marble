Well its just another day of
Getting into trouble
Chasing off the blues
With another bottle

Well I went into a bar
Lookin for some quiet
I said the wrong thing
And it turned into a riot

Hand cut (hand cut)
Face cut (face cut)
Im lucky to wake up face up (face up)

Hand cut (hand cut)
Face cut (face cut)
Im lucky to wake up face up (face up)

Well I woke up somewhere
With an angel on my shoulder
Another day livin
Another day older
Didnt think I was gonna make it ever this far
Tell my story through the voice and guitar

Hand cut (hand cut)
Face cut (face cut)
Im lucky to wake up face up (face up)

Hand cut (hand cut)
Face cut (face cut)
Im lucky to wake up face up (face up)

Hand cut (hand cut)
Face cut (face cut)
Im lucky to wake up face up (face up)

Hand cut (hand cut)
Face cut (face cut)
Im lucky to wake up face up (face up)---
