You're only broken on the outside 
You're shivering, but the warmth will come back 
It's hard to see beyond hindsight 
When all regrets fade in from black 

Did the promise of day, turn cold in the night 
You are the light 
All you have is your name, but the air is alive 
You are the light 

I believe in you 
I believe in you 

It's always hardest when you doubt it 
It's out of sight, it hides from you voice 
But you can never live without it 
It's your birthright, this beautiful noise 

Are you burning the days just to get through the nights? 
You are the light 
All you have is your name, but the air is alive 
You are the light 

I believe in you 
I believe in you 

I believe in you 
I believe in you 

If the years blow away 
To just sand and rain 
We will still find a place 
'cause love breaks through 

I believe in you 
I believe in you 

I believe in you 
I believe in you 

I believe...in you 
I believe...in you 
I believe, I believe in you---Lyrics submitted by Aden.
