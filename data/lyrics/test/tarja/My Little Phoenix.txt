Gracefully she's circling higher. 
She has the wind beneath her wings 
and looks down on us 
She said: 
"Robbed of my innocence, had no more time to play.
 I sure got my feathers burned, but I'm stronger than the flames". 

Here she comes, here she comes. 
I've been waiting for so long. 
Here she comes 
rose again from the flames 
my little Phoenix 
Eternity is set in her eyes 
throwing sparks back at the world that'll never die. 
And I think: 
"She has robbed of her innocence, had no more time to play. 
She's only a little girl, but she stronger than the flames" 

Here she comes, here she comes. 
I've been waiting for so long. 
Here she comes 
rose again from the flames 
my little Phoenix 

You've got to get close to the flame to see 
what it's made of 
You've got to get close to the flame to see what you are made of. 

Here she comes, here she comes. 
I've been waiting for so long. 
Here she comes 
rose again from the flames 
my little Phoenix---Lyrics submitted by Tereza.
