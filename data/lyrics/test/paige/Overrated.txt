I wake, up with you on my TV,
You make, the world around you smile, 
I doubt, your special feature DVD,
Thats out, but you dont have much style.

Magazines, MTV,
What they want,
Is what youll be. 

I see you try and fake it,
I cant sit back and take it.
Everything about you has been overrated,
Overrated, exaggerated truth.
Coz what their watching isnt even you. 

I give, you everything I have and more,
I get, the tickets to see you on tour. 

Late night shows, radio,
Good for you, a million sold. 
Looks like youve finally made it.
Hope you appreciate it,
Everything about you has been overrated.
Overrated, exaggerated truth,
Coz what their watching isnt even you. 

Say goodnight, Thank the press,
Take your place among the rest.
And when youre cashing your check,
I hope you cannot forget,
Everything about you has been overrated,
Overrated, exaggerated truth.

Overrated, on to something new,
Coz they dont make em like they used to,
Overrated, sad to say its true,
coz what their wanting isnt even you.---Lyrics submitted by Paige Daniels.
