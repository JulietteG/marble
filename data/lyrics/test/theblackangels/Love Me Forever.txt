Oh for all that love in your eyes
Oh for all those sights in the night
See its very hard to deny

Me, for everything you left behind
Me, everytime you made me cry
see I told you darl
I will not lie

Yeah love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever

Why does your heart beats with mine?
can you hear them move? 
they are in time
see its very hard to deny

Yeah love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
always for always
always and all days
oh oh oh oh oooohhhhhhh
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever

oh for all that love in your eyes
to me for all those times you made me cry

Yeah love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me forever
Love me or never
Love me or never
Love me or never
Love me or never
