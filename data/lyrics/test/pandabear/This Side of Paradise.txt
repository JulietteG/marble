Every fish that swim in the sea, don't eat it
Every fish that swim in the sea, don't eat it
See what you can and you can't do
See what you can and you can't do
See what you can and you can't do
See what you can and you can't do..

Give the road a good look over
Then make it golden with your common sense
Sold
Give your boy a grip on the shoulder
Build up a totem like a common sense
Mold

Like a sinking ship on the ocean
Like a sinking ship on the ocean
