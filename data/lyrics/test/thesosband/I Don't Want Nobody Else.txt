Do you know, that its true
That for me, and for you
I dont want nobody else
Do you know, that its true
That for me, and for you
I dont want nobody else (No body else)
Nobody but you

I dont want nobody else, its you my love
I'm always, thinking of
You know that its true, I need your love

And, you, know, that I am truly hypnotized
By the sparkle in your eyes (your eyes)
I been looking everytime (everytime the time)
Because you upon my mind
And day after day, there are others who come my way
If this heaven aint here, then baby take thy hands
It is mother nature, the greatest gift to us
And you're the only one for me

And I dont want nobody else (Nobody else)
(Nobody but you) do you know, that its true
That for me, and for you
I dont want nobody else (Nobody else)
Nobody but you

I know why I feel this way
Its because of you, you're everything a man, dreams of
you're like the blooming flower, growing in my heart

And, you, know, that I am truly hypnotized
By the sparkle in your eyes (your eyes)
I been looking everytime (everytime the time)
Because you upon my mind
And day after day, there are others who come my way 
If this heaven aint here, then baby take thy hands
It is mother nature, the greatest gift to us
And you're the only one for me

And I dont want no body else (body else)
Ah babe, (dont you know) dont you know (dont you know) 
Do you know (do you know), you for me (you for me)
Dont you know (dont you know), dont you know 
(nobody else) can make me feel this way (no body but you) 
Ah babe, (dont you know) dont you know, 
Do you know (do you know), (you for me) you for me
(I dont want) I dont want, (I dont want) I dont want 
(nobody else, nobody but you)
Hey baby (do you know), do you know (do you know)
Do you know (yes I know)
I gotta find if you, alright
I dont need no body else, but you (only you)
I love (only you, only you) only ah Baby (yes I do, only you) oh yeah 

I am truly hypnotized (hynotized)
By the sparkle in your eyes (your eyes)
I been looking everytime (everytime the time) (looking everytime)
Because you upon my mind
And day after day (day after day), there are others who come my way 
If this heaven aint here, then baby take thy hands
Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhhh

I am truly hypnotized (hypnotized)
Your the sparkle in my eyes
I been looking everytime (everytime the time) ( all the time)
Because you upon my mind (you are on my mind)
And day after day (day after day), there are others who come my way 
But if heaven aint here, then baby take my hands
ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhhh

I am truly hypnotized (hypnotized)
Your the sparkle in my eyes
I been looking everytime (everytime the time) (all the time, all the time)
Because you upon my mind (you are on my mind)---Lyrics submitted by deedra mills.
