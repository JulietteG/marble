This magic moment, so different and so new
Was like any other until I kissed you
And then it happened, it took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too, By the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine, Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have, whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment, While you lips are close to mine
Will last forever, forever till the end of time

Sweeter than wine, Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have, whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment, While you lips are close to mine
Will last forever, forever till the end of time

Magic moment
Magic moment
Magic moment---Lyrics submitted by Mia Pettersson.
