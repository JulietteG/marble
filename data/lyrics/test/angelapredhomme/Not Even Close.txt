Not Even Close

(Verse 1) 
That guy you see around me
That one whos charming as can be
Right now hes close inside my world  
At every turn
Cant say that he means nothing
Its true, hes something of a friend
I care cause thats just who I am
Its nothing new 
He fades from view
 Cause next to you

(Chorus 1)
Hes not even close
Its you that I chose
And I never question or compare you
Hes not even close
Just mirrors and smoke
 Cause there isnt anyone out there who
Means near what you do

(Verse 2)
That girl youve worried over
That one you fear I cant let go
I used to love her then inside a different time
You know I still respect her
Theres some connection still, but know
That love was buried long ago
But next to you
She fades from view
Like they all do

(Chorus 2)
Shes not even close
Its you that I chose
And I never question or compare you
Shes not even close
Just mirrors and smoke
 Cause there isnt anyone out there who
Means near what you do

(Bridge)
Ive seen the others
Theyre all lackluster
In shadow of your light
Theres not another
Who makes the cut and Ive
Already won the prize

(Chorus 3 - both) 
Theyre not even close
Its you that I chose
And I never question or compare you
Theyre not even close
Just mirrors and smoke
 Cause there isnt anyone out there who
Means near what you do
