Epiphany

Star light, star bright
Heed my wish tonight
Hear my desires
Make them realize
And though I work long and try my hardest
Parts remain unfulfilled
And though I pray hard, yet each tomorrow
Still wont bend to my will

(prechorus)
I wait with haste
Now I see
That faith is what I need

(chorus)
Its an epiphany
Epiphany of learning to let go
Its my epiphany
I finally see that I can trust the flow
I know, I know . . to let go

(verse 2)
Long nights, wound tight
Worrys got me fried
Life wont comply
Fear obscures my sight
Although Ive done well, my sheer ambition
Cant make planets align
And now I just cant escape admitting
True control isnt mine   

(repeat prechorus) 
(chorus 2x)
