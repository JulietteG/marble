So Easy

It's so easy to
It's so easy to love you
That's why I'll say it again
It's so easy
You're so simply delightful
Just irresistible, and
Each day is covered in rainbows of surprise
You woo me with the way you always satisfy

(Chorus)
Let's keep it rollin' 
Let's keep it goin' now
Let's keep it rollin'
Keep the love flowin' out
We couldn't be fresher
Together we win hands down

Its so easy to
Its so easy to love you
Thats why Ill sing it again
Its so easy 
Youre so perfectly wondrous
I cant resist you, and
Each word comes streaming out
Emerging from inside
We sparkle naturally
We dont even have to try

(repeat chorus)
