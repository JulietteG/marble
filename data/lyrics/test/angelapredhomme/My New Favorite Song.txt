Im just swimming in ecstasy
Every time you pull me close
Last night seems like a dream to me
Heres what I remember most
We could hear that music playing loud out on the town
Cant recall the words, but darlin, thats my new favorite song

(chorus)
It went like
doo doo doo
Doo doo doo          
my favorite song

(verse 2)
Youre front row for my fantasy
Youre making it all unfold
Last night it became clear to me
You and I from the same mold
And we were free and flying on the sound of that sweet song
Oh it felt so good when you and I were singing along

(chorus)
It felt like
doo doo doo
Doo doo doo          
my favorite song

(bridge)
Now that melody plays on and on in my head
Taking me straight back to that charmed night that we had

(break w/ hand claps)
 (repeat chorus)
