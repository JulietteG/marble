Maybe I'll Sleep it Off

(verse 1) 
Ive tried 
To pretend its OK 
And enjoy us this way 
But five minutes near you close-range,
My composures in vain
And tonight all I feel is 
I want you right here with me 
But, youre not

(chorus) 
Maybe Ill sleep it off 
And I wont feel this longing 
that pulls at my thoughts 
Maybe Ill sleep it off 
And I can dream away 
these desires that wont stop 
Ill sleep you off

(verse 2) 
Just you 
With oblivious charm 
Hits my soft spot dead on 
I swoon 
Get all woozy inside 
Feelings rush to high tide
Every night youre not here 
though I want you to be with me 
But, youre not

(repeat chorus)

(bridge) 
Feel my words touch you
Breathe me in the air
Veer this way, break through
Find me there

 (repeat chorus)
