Life is Gonna Be Great! 

Life is gonna be great (gray ay ay ay ate)
Can't you see, I just radiate (ray ay ay ay diate)
Now I'm dustin' off my wings
I'll go hovering high up there
'Cause now I've shaken off the weight I don't need 
and I'm free and clear
Without any fear

(Chorus)
Here I go 'cause my life's taking off
There's no ceiling, I broke down the walls
I'm on fire, I can't be rattled
I'm on top, I've won my battles
Here I go 'cause my life's taking off

(Verse 2)
In myself I've got faith (fay ay ay aith)
Dreams are meant to be chased (chay ay ay ay ased)
Bright red carpet's rolling out
Things unfolding so naturally
And now I'm revving up for
These days to come so excitedly
No limits on me

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge)
Oh, how I've waited for this to come around
Been such a long time coming, I'm ready now

(Repeat Chorus)
