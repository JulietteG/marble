Here lies my pride don't come back 
Here lies my pride just die 
Don't come back 
Mass chaos is our weapon of mass unification 
Tied are you by he scarlet thread 
eternal merciless eyes
Death harmonizes with your walk 
Oh how I yearn to dismiss these memories
oh how i yearn to direct these memories
oh how i yearn to digest these memories
oh how i yearn to direct this regret---Lyrics submitted by artemio.
