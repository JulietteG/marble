The concept of fasion is the one to blame.
Painting the portrait of conviction-less exsistence.
Well it must be difficult,
being so gorgeous.

Well it must  be difficult,
claming to be the kings and queens.
But its all,
but its all,
for nothing.

This shall pass,
Megalomania.
This shall pass,
Megalomania.

Congradulations,on mutilation,
Of a life,
of a life,
life,
life,
life,
life,
life,
life,

I'm gonna hope for you,
I'm gonna pray for you,
amongst the reckless and the black.
Salvation lies within.
I'm gonna hope for you,
I'm gonna pray for you,
amongst the reckless and the black.
my time,is yours,my friend.

We all find ourselves,
so horribly weak.

Here's an offering.
Here's an offering.
offering.
offering.---Lyrics submitted by Haley.
