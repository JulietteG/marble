I am the speaker but what is responsibility?

This is beg of you, build me brick upon brick.

High tides; waves of hypocrisy.

I didn't think the clock struck more than twelve times.

I decided to name her insomnia.

"Her teeth (show) like white seeds in a scarlet fruit"

This I must tell you, old friend: fear beauty.

This is meager, this is feeble.

She was only a fiction and my creation---Lyrics submitted by robert.
