Whatever happened to the integrity found within a family?
I return your glare, and my bones are chilled with some sort of sickening recipe of fear and anger.

Day by day, time after time again, time after time again, you distort chronology, you foster of terror.

Bury your diamonds, destroy your rubies.
We are searching for security in tradegy.

take a Look around and notice the black (tapestries) drowning (our walls of) simplicity.

We are the    constant   decay.
Each note will    disintegrate.

Perched upon our towers, motionless and miserable.
Here's to a comfortable casket.

How deceiving is the cemetery of motivation.
I wish to write a conclusion.---Lyrics submitted by robert.
