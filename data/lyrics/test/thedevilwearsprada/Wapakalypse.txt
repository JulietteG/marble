Dear tomorrow,
Find some sensibility.
Respond to emotion.
Dear Politician,
Define sagacity.

One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they have chosen.
One after another, nobody stands behind the ones theyve selected.
Nobody stands behind the nation theyve selected.

All chances of survival are beginning to-beginning to diminish.
Comedy is no excuse for our own blasphemies.
Mass media/mass pessimism/mass denial
My television tells me to panic, but I dont think Ill listen.
The apathetic force us to persevere.
The apathetic, with their backwards priorities.
If only the strongest of stone was not necessary.

One after another, nobody stands behind the ones they have chosen.
One after another, nobody stands behind the ones theyve selected.
Nobody stands behind the nation theyve selected.

We could build a monument for memory:
Liberation includes failure.
Your rebellion is resultless,
So be angry at yourself.
If only we did not deserve this.

Your rebellion is resultless,
So be angry at yourself.---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
