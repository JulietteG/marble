Lately I've been wondering what's been going on
I've been here before but I don't remember when
And every time we get to where we're entering
I feel my beliefs and hopes surrendering

But I know I'll be coming home soon
And yes
I know that I'll be coming home soon

'Cause like the enemies that we are battling
I am nothing but a human alien
Left with nothing else but to keep wandering
Down this path whilst stopping my hands trembling

Because I know that I'll be coming home soon
And yes
I know that I'll be coming home soon with a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes

I've seen inside the devil's dreams where young men die
And graveyards open up their arms for mothers left to cry
I have seen the bleeding and I hate what we've done
But just like every other fool I'll keep marching on

Because I know that I'll be coming home soon
And yes
I know, that I'll be coming home soon with a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes---
