Tonight has been long 
I've smoked every breath 
Trying to feel so alive 
Tempting death 

I've smiled at the angels 
But I fear where they live 
I've taken too much 
With nothing to give 

[Chorus] 
My chemical courage 
Has come to an end 
The night once my lover 
Is no longer my friend 

Well tonignt has gone wrong 
Coz I said what I said 
I've been left all alone 
To lie in my bed 

Thinking I'm just a fake 
But nothing is real 
And if I'm asking to be saved 
I must learn how to kneel 

[Chorus] 
Now my chemical courage 
Has come to an end 
The night once my lover 
Is no longer a friend 
Playing tricks on my eyes 
Shining light on my tears 
Pray for a new day 
To hide all my fears 

Yea-a-a-ah yeah-ah wo-o-o-oh woah 
And I, I can't find a way 
Back to where I felt safe 

[Chorus] 
Now my chemical courage 
Has come to an end 
The night once my lover 
Is no longer my friend 
Playing tricks on my eyes 
Shining light on my tears 
Pray for a new day 
To hide all my fears 
To hide all my fears 
To hide all my fears---Lyrics submitted by Gilles.
