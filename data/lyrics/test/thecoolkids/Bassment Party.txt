They say if you aint got no money take your broke ass home
i say if you got two two dollars then
come through to my party
but get bent before you come cause for that liquor ill be charging
and take down these directions
its right past that intersection
make a right at the light 
its the first house on the left hand
get it got it good
you made it i knew you would 
we got them drinks up in the back
and them chickies looking good
hold up here comes one
hey whats your name hun
jackie brown? ya that pops
hey i'm chuck dis mikey rocks
let me introduce you to some kids that you aint used to
yea we bet that we ride bikes and carrying bones and jordon fives
got every single color so
just in case youre wondering
my parties always loud as a mother is for supper
and in the summer when its hotter than an oven
we the coolest kids we know
so you know we into something
that involved with something
in the trunk to get that bass drum bumping
its my party so get up
if you dont you getting jumped

*(chorus)
whats happening
Hey
wheres the party 
say you heard me saying its a party
right around my way
so if you plan to start it
then dont do nothing small
get everyone involved with
saying its a party*
2x

one to the two
three to the four
chucky and mikey is at your door
we dont knock
we straight on dat
"when your album drop?"
you can wait on that
i dont like the questions you ask, so
and let me tell you a little bit about myself
everywhere i go i act an ass
and if you don't know
better go and ask
at every party i hop the bar
and dance with the chicks on top of that
bartender be like "get off of that"
im like not till i get rich off of rap
then i look to the left
she dipping her hips, and licking her lips at me i guess
i look to the left, look to the right, point to my chest
she was like "thats right"
now let me tell you the recipe
for all you niggers trying to get like me
it takes a scoop of being cool and the rest will be included when you purchase my movie
cause if you knew what i knew
you would probably try to
do whatever i do 
probably move to chicago
if you want instructions
then i can probably front them
just as long as you shorties pay attention
so if you ugly keep your hands by your sides
but if your not then put them in the sky
and if you knowing what it is
its a party at the crib
come and party with the kids  

*(chorus)
whats happening
Hey
wheres the party 
say you heard me saying its a party
right around my way
so if you plan to start it
then dont do nothing small
get everyone involved with
saying its a party*
