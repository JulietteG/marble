That's How People Fall In Love(in love) First Kiss(first kiss) First Touch(first touch)

Can We Make It Like It Was, See this love I have, that I have for you
I Can't Explain For You Girl,
Because I've Been Around The World And I Met Alot Of Other Girls.
But There Nothin Like You   No No No No

[Verse 1: Pleasure]
See I Came At It, And I Came At It, Now I'm So Addicted Like A Gambling Habit
Cause You Was The One Here, When I Ain't Have It
Now You Say You Leaving Me But I Ain't Having It

[Verse 2: Spectacular]

(First Kiss, First Hug)
24-7 U Was On My Mind
(Babygirl U Was My First Love)
We Closer Than The Pages In My Composition Book
(But I Let You Walk In Front So Them Otha Playaz Could Look)
And When They Tried To Holla, You Point At Me And Say That You Took
(And You Been In My Heart, Before I Kno That U Could Cook)

[Verse 3: Slick'em]
See Pleasure Is Pain, And Pain Is Love-
First Kiss, First Touch, First Hug
God Had Send You Up From Above,
2 Jitterbugs On The Back Of The Bus Kissing Like We Grown Ups
But We Broke Up, All The Pain We Went Through Was On Us
A Couple Months Went By, Then We Woke Up
Break Up To Make Up, Girl You Kno Us
And Ya Then Try, But They'll Neva Be Able To Do The Things That You Do
They Ain't Got Yo Style, Yo Body N Smile,
They Ain't Really Off The Chain Like You
Now if you love me don't deny it
Open your door if I'm invited
When it's time for that good lovin
You read my mind like a psychic
So Wheneva I'm Gon, You Worry Bout Yo King To Return To The Throne,
Das Why Out Love Is Strong,
And You Ain't Eva Gotta Worry Bout Me Doin Wrong,
Jus Long As You Come Back Home
Cause Dis Is Where You Suppose To Be,
Right Here Close To Me,
On The Side Of Me, Babygirl You Can Ride With Me, Cause With You, Dats Where I'm Tryna Be U Kno I Love You Girl!

[Chorus:]
That's How People Fall In Love(in love)First Kiss(first kiss)First Touch(first touch)
Can We Make It Like It Was(it was) We Were(we were) In Love(in love)

Can We Make It Like It Was, See this love I have, that I have for you
I Can't Explain For You Girl,
Because I've Been Around The World And I Met Alot Of Other Girls.
But Thyre Nothin Like You    No No No No

[Verse 4: Baby Blue]
U Kno I Love Ya, Frozen Cup Yo Wrist, So I Can Spoil Ya, Hold Ya...
Neva Ignore Ya, Adore Ya, When Times Get Hard, I'll Do Anything For Ya
Remember Back In The Days, Parkway, Catch An Early Matine At The Emine'
Rubbin Oil Of Olay On Yo Body, Hot Tamalae, Because Ya My Shorty (because your my shorty)
Life Passes By When Your Busy
Makin Plans I'm a Be Yo Man, A Veteran, A Business Man, A Gentleman,
I Kno Ya So Sick And Tired Of My Ignorance,
I Can't Breathe, I Can't Get No Sleep, With Out You In My Life, Ain't Complete,
Picnics At The Party, And Corn On The Cob, Real Talk,
From The Start, You Got The Keys Too My Heart, That's A Promise To God.

[Chorus:]
That's How People Fall In Love(in love)First Kiss(first kiss)First Touch(first touch)
