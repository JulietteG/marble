its four o'clock in the morning and she ain't feeling right
im first class trip through this place called life
i don't know what to do 
cause my body still shaking 
i know its time to man up and start my education 
i need someone to call on
so i called on my bestfriend
i said boy i can't take it
he said boy stop trippin 
so i hung up the phone
packed my shit and got rock high 
i know what i got do now 
be a man and face life
baby we can work it out cause you know i can't live without you
and everytime i think about it you know a nigga can't live without you
i even wrote a song about you cause you i can't live without---Lyrics submitted by charlesteen.
