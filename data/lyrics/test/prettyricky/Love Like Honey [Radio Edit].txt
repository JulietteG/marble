I wanna sex you till you fall fast asleep
In the bedroom, listen to the headboard beat
Lay your body down, listen how the mattress squeak
I wanna sex you, I ain't stopping 'til I hear you scream

Our love's like honey, sticky and slow
Drip drop like rain drops, girl, I gotta have some more
Your love's like ice cream, creamy and slow
Tick tock like my clock, baby, wind your body slow

Yeah, Baby Blu, we take walks on the beach
Quality time is okay 'cause I'm dealing with a freak
Massage your feet, girl, what's up?
Let your man tear that thang on up

Tornado blew, how you doing back flips
Twitching and running, biting on your lip
Flip the scene, now you got me shacked up
With whips and handcuffs, I like it rough

I been naughty, give me a whack, wicky wicky whack
And slap me and call me daddy
Makes you happy to give it up gladly
No imitating me, you can't be mad at me

'Cause I rock it properly and it ain't no jocking me
Other women just flock to me
But it ain't no digging you
It's just you and me, come on now

Your love's like honey, sticky and slow
Drip drop like rain drops, girl, I gotta have some more
Your love's like ice cream, creamy and slow
Tick tock like my clock, baby, wind your body slow

Dim the lights, let me start kissing on you, girl
Romance 'cause your body needs freaking, girl
Licking on your neck down to your belly button
Now baby, pull me closer while you get this loving

I got some candles lit, strawberry scent
Baby, say my name, call me 'Sexy Spec'
And then we switch it up and role play
You know I push it down all night and all day

I wanna stroke you up, I wanna lick you down
I wanna give it to you, I wanna make you shout
I wanna do you, do you, do you
I wanna do you, do you, do you
I wanna give it to you, I wanna give it to you

I want to ride it to the East
I want to ride it to the West
Don't wanna go up North
'Cause down South is the best

I wanna do you, do you, do you
I wanna do you, do you, do you
I wanna give it to you

You gotta make the sex cry
You gotta make the sex cry
You gotta make the sex cry
You gotta make the sex cry

Yeah, I got a surprise for you, baby
Ice cream, baby oil and strawberries
Slick 'Em Hound is known to drive that body crazy
I'm trying to give you something you could feel
So close your eyes and hold on tight

You know how I like 'em, 5'5, brown eyes
Thick in the thighs, slim waist, pretty face
Let me taste your lemon pie
A time machine of freaky things you got me feeling like Jodeci

I'm licking them thighs, lifting them thighs
Who's is this? You know it's mine
Temperature rising, fantasizing, dese n dise
I got your body on top of mine, I wanna do you, girl

I wanna sex you 'til you fall fast asleep
In the bedroom, listen to the headboard beat
Lay your body down, listen how the mattress squeak
I wanna sex you, I ain't stopping till I hear you scream

Your love's like honey, sticky and slow
Drip drop like rain drops, girl, I gotta have some more
Your love's like ice cream, creamy and slow
Tick tock like my clock, baby, wind your body slow---Lyrics submitted by La.
