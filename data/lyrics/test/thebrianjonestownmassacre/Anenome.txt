I
I think i know how i feel
Cause i
I only play it for-real
You should be picking me up
Instead you're dragging me down
Flying over my head
You're landing all over town

You
You know that i try
Try to tell you the truth
Oh baby don't make me lie
You should be picking me up
Instead you're dragging me down
Now i'm missing you more
Cause baby you're not around
Now that you're not around

I
I want to know how it feels
Cause i
I only play act for-real
You should be picking me up
Instead your dragging me down
I could be giving you love
But you're not around
Now that you're not around
Now that you're not around
Glad that you're not around.---Lyrics submitted by jennifer hagger.
