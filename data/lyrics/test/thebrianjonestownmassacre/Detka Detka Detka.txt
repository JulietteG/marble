        
(Baby baby baby I want you so sweetly)
        
(Baby baby baby you got into this cage neatly)
        
(Baby baby baby it will often be rather than rarely)
          
(Baby baby baby we're like two fish in the net)

  
(I will love you)
     
(Only after I die)

        
(The two of us in this world we need this planet)
        
(The sun is shining bright we are not cold but hot)
       
(Through the fires of Berlin past we climb by car)
        
(We shall destroy all boundaries wake up we fly like a bird)---Lyrics submitted by Edward Ivans.
