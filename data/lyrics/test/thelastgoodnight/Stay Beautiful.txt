Sunday morning at the door
You were coming back for more
We were kicking it all around
I was looking in your eyes
You thought it was justified
You said, m m m m more

[Chorus]
Don't stop, Don't change, Stay beautiful
One life, Today, You're irresistible
Get up, Get out, Stay wonderful
All this time is waiting for you
Don't stop, Don't change, Stay beautiful

Poison kisses in the rain you were calling out my name
Laughing like the joke was on me

Singin.....
Ba da da ba da da
Ba da da ba da da
Ba ba ba ba da

[Chorus]

Post cards, throwing darts, side kicks and super marts
Break dance, second chance, I will run to you
Sideways, back and forth, wake up, hit the floor
Oh no, where'd you go, it will come to you
One more, day like this
One more, poison kiss
One more, hand to fist
I will run to you
Always, first in line
Always, on my mind
Always, doing fine
It will come to you

Ba da da ba da da
Ba da da ba da da
Ba ba ba ba da

Don't stop, Don't change, Stay beautiful
One life, Today, Your irresistible
Get up, Get out, Stay wonderful
All this time is waiting for you

Don't stop, don't change, stay beautiful
One life, today, your irresistible
Get up, get out, stay wonderful
All this time is waiting for you
Don't stop, don't change, stay beautiful

Don't stop, Don't change, Stay beautiful
One life, Today, Is undeniable
Get up, Get out, Stay wonderful
All this time is waiting for you---Lyrics submitted by aimee.
