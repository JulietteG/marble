You are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my entire life
You are the most beautiful thing these eyes have seen

I met you at St. John's Cathedral down on Amsterdam
Made a trade with the devil and he gave me your hand
We both know this castles' made of sand
Close your eyes and fall asleep again

I will fall asleep here in your arms
Every breath that you take breaks my heart

I built us this boat so we both could sail far, far away
It sprung a leak inside the captain forgot to say
"That love is made of treading water and hearts of clay"
I had no idea, I had no idea, that we would die today

You are the most beautiful thing I've every seen in my entire life
You are the most beautiful thing these eyes have seen

I will fall asleep here in your arms
Every breath that you take breaks my heart
I will fall asleep here in your arms
Every breath that you take breaks my heart

And what would you think and what would you do?
After the storm that we've been through
I will come to your rescue
I will save this life tonight
And this could be everything that I ever could 've owed you
I hear goodbye

I met you at St. John's Cathedral down on Amsterdam
Made a trade with the devil and he gave me your hand

I will fall asleep here in your arms
Every breath that you take breaks my heart
And what would you think and what would you do?
After the storm that we've been through
I will come to your rescue
I will save this life tonight
I will fall asleep here in your arms---Lyrics submitted by aimee.
