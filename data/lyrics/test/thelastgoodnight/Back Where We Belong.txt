You kiss me, kill me, push me, pull me, leave me wanting more
You keep your promises back behind the bedroom door
You hit me harder than I ever have been hit before
I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, long before I met you I was
Crazy, crazy to forget you but just
Maybe, what you see is what you get for sure
Can't take this anymore

[Chorus]
If you can feel it when it comes down
And you can see it coming around and around
If you believe this is a moment, control it
You feel it getting better, back where we belong

We keep on playing games and reaching out for something new
I'd rather walk with you than run with the other fools
Just let your body do the talking and we speak the truth
You know I do

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

It's just a feeling, taking me over
Time after time I'm losing control
You got a lot of things to give
Got a lot of life to live
It takes a little patience, baby
But things are changing, things are going to:

Baby, baby, long before I met you I was
Crazy, crazier than ever

[Chorus]

Baby, baby, long before I met you I was
Crazy, crazier than ever be my
Lady, what you see is what you get for sure
Can't take this anymore---Lyrics submitted by aimee.
