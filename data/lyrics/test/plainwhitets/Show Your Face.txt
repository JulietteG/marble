C mon with your body straight to the place surround me
And if you had .
So if you want to be my girl
Youd better show your face surround my world 
Wohoho
Show your face to me.

Cmon you the people come and dance to this sound tonight.
Let the music overwhelmed then you know its gonna be alright.
So if you want to be my girl
Youd better show your face surround my world 
Wohoho
Show your face to me.

So let the bureau know that the world is out
If you hear what Im saying then come on and shout with me
Cuz every time I see your smile face, the face, the face, the music sets you free.
So if you want to be my girl
Youd better show your face surround my world 
Wohoho
Show your face to me.---Lyrics submitted by Juan.
