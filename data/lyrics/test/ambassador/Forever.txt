I may burn out like a candle and I may pass away
I may fall just like a shooting star
My heart will stay
Ill be yours until forever
Forever Ill be true

To the promise I have made
From the day that I found you
Forever youre in my heart
Even if were apart

I say forever Ill be yours
Forever I love you
I say forever Ill be yours
Forever I love you

My love will never fade away
Even if I die
And I will love you 
Until the end of time
Even without your smile

So hear me please
I beg you
Dont walk away I need you
To stay with me
And be by my side
Take my hand
And well work it out
Until

Forever Ill be yours
Forever I love you
I say forever Ill be yours
Forever Ill be true

My love will never fade away
Even if I die
And I will love you 
Until the end of time
Even without your smile

So hear me please
I beg you to stay---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
