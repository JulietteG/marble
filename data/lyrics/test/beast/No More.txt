----------
Why arent you over me yet like a fool?
Why am I still a good person to you?
Its already been a few months since we broke up
But why are you still living in the memories?

There are a lot of good people next to you
Its okay if you start a new love
Ill truly wish for your happiness with a smile
I keep seeing you wandering around
So I cant start a new love
Oh yeah, at this late hour, you

Why did you come to me again?
When its me whos too cowardly to let you go?
I hear your sad cries on the other side of the door
Why did you come to me again?
When Ive already cooled down
I have no more warmth to share with you anymore

No more, no more, Im not someone you can lean on anymore

Fine, cry all you want,
if thats what it takes to wash me all away
If thats what it takes to erase all the lingering attachment in your heart
Im not worth the pain youre going through
Im not the same person who was with you in the past
I dont wanna lie
and say I let you go because I love you
Ill stay with you just for today, hurry and get up
I can hold out my hand but its just for today

We cant go back, you know that
You cant be happy next to me
I keep seeing you wandering around
So I cant be at peace for a single day
So I cant start a new love
Oh yeah, at this late hour, you

Why did you come to me again?
When its me whos too cowardly to let you go?
I hear your sad cries on the other side of the door
Why did you come to me again?
When Ive already cooled down
I have no more warmth to share with you anymore

Please stop,
Im getting colder as time goes by
So Im afraid that Ill hurt you
Just live happily as if you have something to prove to me
No more, Im not someone you can lean on anymore

Why did you come to me again?
When its me whos too cowardly to let you go?
I hear your sad cries on the other side of the door
Why did you come to me again?
When Ive already cooled down
I have no more warmth to share with you anymore

No more, no more, Im not someone you can lean on anymore---
