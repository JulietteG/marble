I not on an ego trip, 
I'm nothing on my on
I've made mistakes and often slip, 
just common flesh and bone
Oh but I'll prove some day just what I say, 
I'm of a special kind
Fo when he was on the cross,
 I was on his mind

A look of love was on his face, 
the thorns were on his head
But god wass on that s scarlet robe,
 and stained it crimson red
Though his eys were on the crown that day,
 he looked ahead and smiled
Cause when he was on the cross, 
I was on his mind...

For he knew me,
 yet he loved me,
He whos glory makes,
 the heaven shine,
 So unworthy, 
of such mercy,
Yet when he was on the cross,
I was on his mind!---Lyrics submitted by caleb thomasson.
