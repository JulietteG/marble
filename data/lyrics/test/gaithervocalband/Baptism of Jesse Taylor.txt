Among the local taverns, there'll be a slack in business
'Cause Jesse's drinkin' came before the groceries and the rent
Among the local women, there'll be a slack in cheatin'
'Cause Jesse won't be be steppin' out again

They baptized Jesse Taylor in Cedar Creek last Sunday
Jesus gained a soul and Satan lost a good right arm
They all cried, "Hallelujah", when Jesse's head went under
'Cause this time he went under for the Lord

The scars on Jesse's knuckles are more than just respected
The country courthouse records tell all there is to tell
The pockets of the gamblers will soon miss Jesse's money
And the black eye of the law will soon be well

They baptized Jesse Taylor in Cedar Creek last Sunday
Jesus gained a soul and Satan lost a good right arm
They all cried, "Hallelujah", when Jesse's head went under
'Cause this time he went under for the Lord

Well, form now on Nancy Taylor can proudly speak to neighbors
And tell now much Jesse took up with little Jim
Now Jimmy's got a daddy and Jesse's got a family
And Franklin County's got a more man

They baptized Jesse Taylor in Cedar Creek last Sunday
Jesus gained a soul and Satan lost a good right arm
They all cried, "Hallelujah", when Jesse's head went under
'Cause this time he went under for the Lord

Yes, they baptized Jesse Taylor in Cedar Creek last Sunday
Jesus gained a soul and Satan lost a good right arm
They all cried, "Hallelujah", when Jesse's head went under
'Cause this time he went under for the Lord

Yeah, this time he went under for the Lord---Lyrics submitted by newland reese.
