All my life long I had panted
For a drink from some cool spring
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst i felt within

[Chorus]
Oh Hallelujah I have found Him
Whom my soul so long had craved
Jesus satisfies my longing
Thru' His blood I now I'm saved

Feeding on the husks around me,
Till my strength was almost gone,
Longed my soul for something better,
Only still to hunger on.

[Chorus]
Oh Hallelujah I have found Him
Whom my soul so long had craved
Jesus satisfies my longing
Thru' His blood I now I'm saved

Well of water ever springing
Bread of life so rich and free
Untold wealth that never faileth
My Redeemer is to me 

[Chorus]
Oh Hallelujah I have found Him
Whom my soul so long had craved
Jesus satisfies my longing
Thru' His blood I now I'm saved---Lyrics submitted by johnhmar.
