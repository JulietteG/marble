Somewhere just across the Jordan River,
Is a place of everlasting joy and peace.
Where the stream of life is flowing there forever,
And the crown of life is waiting there for me.

That sounds like home to me,
Like where I want to be 
There'll be no tears, to fill our eyes again
The hills will echo with the story,
As we sing of, his grace and glory.
Where the saints of God will be,
That sounds like home to me.

Oh, they say there's only joy inside, that city,
And little playing by, the tree of life.
No pain, no disappointments there will hurt us,
And Jesus Christ Himself, will be the light.

That sounds like home to me,
Like where I want to be.
Therell be no tears to fill our eyes again.
The hills will echo, with the story,
As we sing of, His grace and glory.
Where the saints of God will be,
That sounds like home to me.

That sounds like home to me,
Like where I want to be.
Therell be no tears to fill our eyes again.
The hills will echo with the story,
As we sing of, His grace and glory.
Where the saints, of God will be,
That sounds like home to me.

The hills will echo with the story
As we sing of his grace and glory
Where the saints of God will be,
That sounds like home to me---Lyrics submitted by ALB.
