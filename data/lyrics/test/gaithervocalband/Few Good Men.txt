What this dying world could use is a willing Man of God
Who dares to go against the grain and works without applause:
A man who'll raise the shield of Faith, protecting what is pure;
Whose love is tough and gentle; a man whose word is sure;
God doesn't need an Orator who knows what just to say;
He doesn't need authorities to reason him away;
He doesn't need an army to guarantee a win;
He just needs a Few Good Men.
Men full of Compassion, who laugh and love and cry-
Men who'll face eternity and aren't afraid to die-
Men who'll fight for freedom and honor once again-
He just needs a Few Good Men
He calls the broken derelict whole life has been renewed;
He calls the one who has the strength to stand up for the truth.
Enlistment lines are open and He wants you to come on in-
He just needs a Few Good Men.
Men full of Compassion, who laugh and love and cry-
Men who'll face eternity and aren't afraid to die-
Men who'll fight for freedom and honor once again-
He just needs a Few Good Men.
Men full of Compassion, who laugh and love and cry-
Men who'll face eternity and aren't afraid to die-
Men who'll fight for freedom and honor once again-
He just needs a Few Good Men.---Lyrics submitted by Pat.
