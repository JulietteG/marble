(verse 1)
In a dark lonely valley
Of a desert so dry
I so was so thirsty
For the water of life
With no real direction
I was lost as could be
But then i met Jesus
And Jesus showed me

(chorus)
Mountains of mercy
Oceans of grace
Love and forgiveness
Taken away, the guilt and the shame
Well I've traded all my doubts and fears
And every sin i could not erase
For mountains of mercy
And oceans of grace

(verse 2)
From the height of my weakness
To the depth of my sin
I was finally forgiven
Of all i had been
Just like a prisoner
From darkness, set free
Cause when i touched heaven
And heaven touched me

Chorus

Hmm,
I once was lost
And now I'm found
He lifted me
To higher ground
I once was blind
But now I see

Chorus

Cuz I've traded all my doubts and fears
And every sin i could not erase
For mountains of mercy oceans of grace---Lyrics submitted by pasivao maani.
