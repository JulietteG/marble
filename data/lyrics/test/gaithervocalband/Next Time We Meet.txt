VERSE:
Some will have died, most will have cried
All will have felt the touch of pain
Wherever we go, theres one thing we know
Love conquers everything

CHORUS:
Next time we meet, therell be no more tears
Next time we share the bread and the wine
Maybe tomorrow, maybe next year
We will be one, next time

VERSE:
Broken the bread, buried the dead
Yet somehow life will always win
Empty the cup, drink it all up
Well be together again---Lyrics submitted by Laura Stancea.
