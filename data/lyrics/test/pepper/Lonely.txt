Tired and confused
Well now you're running from the west
Yes your heart, it's so abused
But does your mind need a rest?
Oh darling

I wouldn't cry, it might make a flood
And I don't know if I can swim that good
No I wouldn't cry, that might make a flood
And I don't know if I can swim that good

I've been lonely, only
When I stop to think about you
So I don't stop
I just keep on
Trying to keep my head above these blues

Yeah we're down here in Rome
But we're longing to come home
You know the last train is gone
You know the last bird has flown

I wouldn't cry, it might make a flood
And I don't know if I can swim that good
No I wouldn't cry, that might make a flood
And I don't know if I can swim that good

I've been lonely, only
When I stop to think about you
So I don't stop
I just keep on
Trying to keep my head above these blues

I keep my head cooled down
And woman I'd fall out
If that gets me back there to you
So I keep my head above
When things start to get rough
Your picture's never, never, never, never

Lonely, only when I stop to think about you
So I don't stop
I just keep on
Trying to keep my head above these blues

I've been lonely, only
When I stop to think about you
So I don't stop
I just keep on
Trying to keep my head above these blues

I've been lonely, only
When I stop to think about you
So I don't stop
I just keep on
Trying to keep my head above these blues

Last train is gone
You know the last bird has flown---Lyrics submitted by Tony Dixey.
