Well it's true that we fight every night
And the neighbors complain to the lord
Tears are crisp in the icebox light
Shows us what we can't afford
Not too much I'm sorry
She turns her head and walks away from me
Am I out of luck
Cuz I ended up
Sleeping in my kitchen doorway
How'd you get so far from my Ordinary day
Because you love to walk a...
Words still haunt me around this room
Sad hours of lonely rain go...
Arguments that didn't stop your heart
Don't sink and drown
They're all driftin towards your breakdown
Am I out of luck
Cuz I ended up
Sleeping in my kitchen doorway
How'd you get so far from my Ordinary day
Because she loves to walk away
Am I out of luck
Cuz I ended up
Sleeping in my kitchen doorway
How'd you get so far from my Ordinary day
Because she loves to walk away
You love to walk away from me
You love to walk away from me---Lyrics submitted by Tony Dixey.
