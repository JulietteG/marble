Hey!
I got the right of way, and that's all you got to say
I been thinking about, thinking about some things I thought I'd never be thinking
Too many drugs dropped into my mouth looking for something new but I end up drinking
Ignore the warnings on the shore, I'll take my chance swim into danger
I wanna taste life more and more but you need a little risk for the perfect mixture

This is your station under no control, broadcasting for you to let go
This is your station under no control, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up enjoy the show

Hey!
I got the right of way, that's all I got to say
Jesus gone just a flame and a bomb now how do you explode unstable
Big suit with a briefcase  I'm holding contracts stating how you're labeled 
Holding onto a phone on hold while I'm told to wait for the next operator
I  wanna taste life uncontrolled, on no here I go I hope to see you later

This is your station under no control, broadcasting for you to let go
This is your station under no control, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up enjoy the show

Hey!
I got the right of way, that's all you got to say
This is your station under no control, broadcasting for you to let go
This is your station under no control, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up enjoy the show
This is your station under no control, broadcasting for you to let go
This is your station under no control, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up enjoy the show

Everything that I would like to see, broadcast this emergency
Everything that I would like to see, broadcast this emergency
Emergency, emergency, emergency, emergency---Lyrics submitted by erynn.
