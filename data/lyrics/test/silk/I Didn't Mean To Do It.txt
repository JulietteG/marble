Oooh, yeah, yeah 

[1]
I didn't mean to break your heart 
I didn't mean to do you wrong 
I didn't mean to lie to you 
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to 

I didn't mean to sex off on you 
I didn't mean to make you cry 
I didn't mean to cheat on you 
So forgive me for all that I've done 

I didn't mean to take for granted 
That you would always be right here 
I know you heard me say I'm sorry 
So many years 

But I admit that I was wrong 
For leaving you all alone 
But now I finally realize 
Cuz I see the pain in your eyes 

[Repeat 1]

Girl I hope that you still love me 
I'm trying to let you know I've changed 
I can't imagine life without you 
I'd go insane 

I wanna make it up to you 
By giving all my love to you 
Cuz now I finally understand 
That I've got to be a better man 

[Repeat 1]

Girl, I swear to you I've changed 
Things won't be the same no more 
For as long as I live 
I'll keep it real with you girl 

Cross my heart and hope to die 
My hurtin' eyes been crying for weeks 
Put me in the corner 
Put me in time-out 
Mistakes I've made before 
I wouldn't make no more, girl 

So cus me out 
Scream at the top of your lungs if you want to 
Just don't leave me, forgive me 

[Spoken]
Baby, I know I made alot of mistakes in the past 
But right now I'm trying to be the best that I can be 
And I want us to be the best that we can be 
So what I'm asking you to do for me right now is 
To try to forgive me, I'm sorry 
Forgive me, forgive me, oh 

[Repeat 1]

I'm down on my knees, begging you please 
I'm down on my knees, begging you please 
I'm down on my knees, begging you please 
So forgive me for all that I've done 

I'm down on my knees, begging you please 
I'm down on my knees, begging you please 
I'm down on my knees, begging you please 
So forgive me for all that I've done 

What I'm saying is that 
We've got too much to live for 
We've got too much together, baby 
Just don't let it all end 
Oh baby, I wish I could let you know 
Just how sorry I am 
I know I hurt you 
I don't ever want to hurt you again 
Cuz when I hurt you, it hurts me too 
I'm sorry 

Think about it 
What about the kids? 
I don't give a damn about the house and 
I don't give a damn about the car 
But as long as you and my kids are in my life 
That's all that matters 
Please, find it in your heart to forgive me 
I'll never do it again, I promise, baby 
I love you too much 
How I love what we have together 
Cuz in my mind, one and one makes one, it don't make two 
Don't you know I need you 
Oh I love you---Lyrics submitted by Keta.
