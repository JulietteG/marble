When the devil is all around, got you crawlin' on the ground
On your hands and your knees with an apple in your mouth
You will know how far you'll go to make your peace with god

I got a-wasted and I sat around the fire all day
See if I could find some one to make love to
And I barely even noticed how the fibers did tear away
From the fabric of my being

But nobody knows it like you do, babe
Nobody knows it like you do
Nobody knows it like you do, babe
The lengths we will go to...

I going down the long road, maybe it's the wrong road
Either way I've got to find my way back home again
And it's too late to turn back now, gotta get the lead on out
Gotta find some way to make it right, oh

But nobody knows it like you do, babe
Nobody knows it like you do
Nobody knows it like you do, babe
The lengths we will go to...

There must be some other way, I just don't know
How to get myself back up on that high road
But nobody knows it like you do

So I'm gonna be a good man, gonna do the best I can
Though I'm a shell of a man that I once was
And if I find forgiveness in the eyes of god
It'll be hard won, I assure you

Cause when the devil is all around, got you crawling on the ground
On your hands and your knees with and apple in your mouth
You will know how far you'll go to make your peace with god
Yeah, you will know how far you'll go to make your peace with god---
