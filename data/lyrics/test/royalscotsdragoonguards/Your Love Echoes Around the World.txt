Your gentle love has sweet embraced
All the memories I had to hold
When I close my eyes
I see your face
Your love echo's around the world.

In my dreams I hold you close to me
In the stars you shine like gold
Its the beat of your heart
That sets me free
Your love echoes around the world

As the shadows fall the sun will rise
I surrender you my soul
And I know you guide
Me there to you
Your love echos around the world

Your precious love and sweet embrace
Is all I have to hold
But I know one day
Ill see your face
your love echos around the world
your love echos around the world
your love echos around the world---Lyrics submitted by Eric Johnson.
