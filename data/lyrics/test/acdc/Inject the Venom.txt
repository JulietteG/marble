No mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
Oooh, no mercy from me

Tell no truth and tell no lies
Cross your heart and hope to die
Never give what you can't take back
Scratch like a cat
Oh inject your venom
It'll be your last attack

No mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
V.E.N.O.M.

Got no heart no, feel no pain
Take your soul and leave a stain
Come choose your victim
Take him by surprise
Go in hard and get him
Right between the eyes and

Inject the venom, oh
Inject the venom, c'mon
Inject the venom
Inject it all, ooh, stick it in, stick it

Come on, inject the venom
Inject the venom

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Inject the venom, get it all
Inject the venom
Inject the venom, inject it all
Inject the venom!---Lyrics submitted by Esau.
