Riot on the radio
pictures on the tv
invader man take what he can
shoot out on the silver screen
sticking 'em up and knocking 'em down
loving out a fantasy
there's a bad man cruising around
in a big black limousine
don't let it be wrong
don't let it be right
get in his way
you're dead in his sights

Chorus

Big Gun
Big gun number 1
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you

Terminators, uzi makers
shooting up Hollwood
shakes alive with a .45
setting off and doing no good
if you aint wise they'll cannabilise
tear your flesh off
classified lady killers
prayin in the human zoo
they saddle you up 
and take you to town 
better look out when he comes around

Chorus
(slow down)

Big gun, got a hot one
Big gun, got a number one
Big gun, loaded and cocked
Big gun, hot hot hot 
Got big gun, ready or not
Big gun, give, give it a shot

Terminators, uzi makers
regulators, gonna get you later
Big gun kick the hell out of you---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
