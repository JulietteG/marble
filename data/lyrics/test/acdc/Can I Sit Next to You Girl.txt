I met this girl for the first time on Saturday night
Standing in the queue at the Odeon alright
Oh I took her by surprise
When I gave her one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine, ha
That's when I saaaaaay

Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you

At intermission we were doing alright
'Til this guy came up and stood by her side, ooo
Oh I took him by surprise
When I gave him one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine
And that's when I saay

Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you
Can I sit next to you
Too much, too much for me, hoh

Oh yeah
Alright
So let me

Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you
Lemme, go on
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you
Lick your ear
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Come on
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I sit next to you girl
Can I---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
