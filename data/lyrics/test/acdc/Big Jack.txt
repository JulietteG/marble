The steam is a burning,
Workin up and down the line,
The pot is getting ready,
Hes been working it so hard,
When it comes to lovin,
Big jack is on his way,
Wink of satisfaction,
His time is going on,
Im like a bad defender,
Smoking holy Joe,
Hes a big pretender, look out for jack,
Hes on his way,

Big Jack, Big Jack,
You know its only natural, he gets you up to scratch,
Big Jack, Big Jack,
Youve got a reputation you really got the knack,
Big Jack, Big Jack,
He said that hes the only one who got a full sack,
Big Jack, look out Jack, hes always at your back.

You never leave a dollar,
Racking up the balls,
You like to get it on fast,
Back there standing tall,
When he hears the siren,
Hes gonna put you on the racks,
Hes got a bad reputation, climbing all over the bars
Gonna press the flesh,
Rockin rollin soldier,
Hes the last of them all,
Well tell jack, hes on his way,

Big Jack, Big Jack,
You know its only natural to get you up to scratch,
Big Jack, Big Jack,
Always in trouble got to turn the other way,
Big Jack, Big Jack,
Always like to party and he likes the girls to play,
Big Jack, look out Jack, hes always at your back,

Big Jack, Big Jack,
You know its only natural to get you up to scratch,
Big Jack, Big Jack, youve got a reputation, really got the knack,
Big Jack, Big Jack, he said he aint the only one who got a big sack,
Big Jack, lookout Jack, aint no need to worry, hes always at your back---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
