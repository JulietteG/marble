Im rolling thunder pouring rain
Im coming on like a hurricane
My lightning's flashing across the sky
You're only young but you're gonna die
I won't take no prisoners won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell I'm gonna take you to hell
Im gonna get ya Satan get ya

Hells bells, hells bells
Hells bells, you got me ringing
Hells bells, my temperature's high
Hells bells

Ill give you black sensations up and down your spine
If you're into evil you're a friend of mine
See the white light flashing as I split the night
Cos if good's on the left then I'm sticking to the right
I won't take no prisoners won't spare no lives
Nobody's puttin' up a fight
I got my bell I'm gonna take you to hell
Im gonna get ya Satan get ya

Hells bells, hells bells
Hells bells, you got me ringing
Hells bells, my temperature's high
Hells bells

Hells bells, Satan coming to you
Hells bells, he's ringing them now

Those hells bells, my temperature's high
Hells bells, across the sky
Hells bells, they're taking you down
Hells bells, theyre dragging you down
Hells bells, gonna split the night
Hells bells, there's no way to fight

Hells bells---
