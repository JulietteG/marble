You hypnotize

Hotter
Gettin' hotter
You do it
Hmmm, do it good
Do it all right
Every night
When you turn off the light
It's outta sight
Bwalright

You hypnotize
And mesmerize
with your dirty eyes
dirty eyes
Your dirty eyes

Breathin
Breathin heavy
Heavy
Heavy breathin
Send shivers down my spine
And I'm so glad that you're mine 
That's what turns me on-on
All night long

You hypnotize
Mesmerize
With your dirty eyes
Dirty Eyes
You got dirty eyes
Dirty Eyes

Dirty Eyes
Dirty Eyes
Dirty Eyes
Dirty Eyes
I love your dirty eyes
Dirty Eyes
Dirty Eyes
Right through me
Your dirty eyes
Dirty Eyes
Dirty Eyes
Dirty Eyes
Dirty Eyes
Dirty Eyes
Right on
Dirty Eyes---Lyrics submitted by jacob.
