The nights were so long it was what we made it
I can't understand why everything came to an end
Our love was so strong I'll never forget it
We were one in the same and I watched it all go by

The day we made love upon the rooftop
I swore to myself, we'd always be here together
But that's not enough times are always changing
We were only so young we had our reasons why

CHORUS
But still I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Only time will tell the end
They were the best days of my life
The best times that I had
The best days of my life, well they ended so sad
How could we change what was right
We didn't care what people said
Yeah, the best days of my life I spent with you

Livin' so free who couldn't blame us
Well I understand, why everything came to an end
Hey now, our love was so strong, I'll never forget it
We were one in the same, and I watched it all go by

CHORUS

They said we were nothing but one in the same
Oh, we bled on our lives
We were willing to die
And now that I know that there's no one to blame
That's not right

CHORUS
Yeah, the best days of my life I spent with you (x3)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
