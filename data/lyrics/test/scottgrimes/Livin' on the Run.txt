Jenny's only friend was a girl I knew
Oh, how we all want to be a star
She worked at the sideshow cafe on Second Avenue
Takin' a five every ten, wasn't going too far
Oh, what are these people thinking?

They can't stand in our way
They can say what they want to
I'm gonna marry you someday

CHORUS
We'll be livin' on the run again
Takin' all the life we can
Doin' what we please
Holdin' on to you
Ridin' down the highway
If they take away what's mine
Still you see the love will shine
Won't it be alright?
Look up at the sun
Livin' on the run

Motel to motel, rain or shine all day
Town to town, never singing the same song
Philly about 12am, that's all I gotta say
Oh, you can never love too strong

Well we can walk these streets forever
Maybe one hundred miles
And I've seen all these faces
Maybe a thousand times

CHORUS

Well, we can walk these streets of fortune
Take your time along the way
You got that sheepskin rug to keep you warm
You got those smokes when you got nothin' to say
And all those dreams of singin' to the second row
Baby you were "born to run"
I got this time upon my pocket, and my love for you
And I'll be having fun

Yeah, here we go

Jenny said yes right here on Venice Blvd.
Oh, you come all this way better do it right
What are we gonna do I said, she said it's not that hard
Oh, we're gonna have some fun tonight

Well we can walk these streets forever
Maybe one hundred miles
And I've seen all these faces
Maybe a thousand, just a thousand, just a thousand times again

We'll be livin' on the run again
Takin' all the life we can
Doin' what we please
Holdin' on to you
Ridin' down the highway, yeah
If they take away what's mine
Still you see the love will shine
Won't it be alright?
Have a little faith
If you've got the time
I will show the race
Yeah, it'll be alright
Look up at the sun
Livin' on the run
We'll be livin', yeah we'll be livin' on the run---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
