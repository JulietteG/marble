Welcome to submission, welcome to your home
Just sit and watch the mindless march of drones
Are you dead or living? Are you in control?
It's hell on earth, the weak have lost their soul

Face assimilation! Go out on your own!
Their despotism will be overthrown
They'll call upon the ancients, foretell the end is near
Apocalyptic doom will stoke our fear

Now die on the cross you nation of fools, with your feet of clay
Starvation, stagnation, damnation for the cruel
Now you know your day is coming, and you're running out of time

Void of aspiration, surrender your control
The weak will always do as they are told
Can't escape the wicked, can't escape the truth
But mutiny will sever the abuse

Now die on the cross you nation of fools, with your feet of clay
Starvation, stagnation, damnation for the cruel
Now you know your day is coming, and you're running out of time

Never in a million years did you believe we'd catch you
Never in your darkest fears could you conceive you'd ever have to pay

A holocaust across the nation, oh, now it's on
It's too late to seek salvation
Stealing what you can before it's gone

Fight the man who breeds oppression
Light the torch of reason
Bite the hand that feeds

Your day has come... Welcome home

Now die on the cross you nation of fools, with your feet of clay
Starvation, stagnation, damnation for the cruel
Now you know your day is coming. Your day has come... Welcome home---Lyrics submitted by Chum.
