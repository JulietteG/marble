Oh we are who we are when in danger
And we are as we stand head in hand
When a friend brings to light
On a cold silver knife
You can stare your fate right into his hands
                                                   into his nands


Oh we are what we are when we'll name to
Be the soul-owning guardians of lands
And there's always advice
On a cold winter's night
That your dreams are just an island in the sand
                                                  Way out in the sand


Don't it seem so strange
How it just don't change
Things just stay the same
As they've always been
Some of us are out to win
And some others are out just to aim
                                       out just to aim


Oh we are what we are when we're praying
In our own way of seeking some light
May the mission bell still ring
Of the colourful dreams
In the faith that everyone will be treated right---Lyrics submitted by Richard.
