O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel!
Shall come to thee, O Israel!

O come, O come, Great Lord of might
And to thy tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times once gave the law
In majesty on cloud and awe

Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel!
Shall come to thee, O Israel!---
