Never been the type to leave much room for anyone to speak
Always been about what I want, listen to me while I preach
Never been the kind to make much space for emotions in a fight
Anything I didn't wanna hear, I just preached 'til what was right

But you, you got me on the line
Told me that you think it's time
Make a change or this is gonna stall
Shape up or you'll drop me like a call

Now I wanna write a love song
Even though you never ever ask me for one
Write you a letter, send sweet poems
Ask you for forgiveness, tell you I was wrong
Sit myself down, bring my pride in
And start to focus, change who I've been
Give me a second, let me u-turn
Write you the love song you've earned

I been at this so long I can barely stand to think it now
Every second of my life was was packed until I broke them down
I've been selfish so long I don't know why you would ever stay
Every minute you've been here, I've been pushing you and your love away

But you, you got me on the line
Told me that you think it's time
Make a change or this is gonna stall
Shape up or you'll drop me like a call

Now I wanna write a love song
Even though you never ever ask me for one
Write you a letter, send sweet poems
Ask you for forgiveness, tell you I was wrong
Sit myself down, bring my pride in
And start to focus, change who I've been
Give me a second, let me u-turn
Write you the love song you've earned

Every time I think I hurt you
All I have to do is think through
What I want, list your virtues
Apologize, I don't deserve you
Every time I know I hurt you
All I have to do is run through
What I need, list your virtues
Apologize, I don't deserve you

Now I wanna write a love song
Even though you never ever ask me for one
Write you a letter, send sweet poems
Ask you for forgiveness, tell you I was wrong
Sit myself down, bring my pride in
And start to focus, change who I've been
Give me a second, let me u-turn
Write you the love song you've earned
Give me a second, let me u-turn
Write you the love song you've earned---
