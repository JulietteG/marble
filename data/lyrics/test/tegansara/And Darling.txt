Creep up and tell me that you
You love me more each time you
Look into my eyes, I feel like
I know you don't mean to be mean
I'm sure you know the same for me
When you creep up and tell me
Darling
It breaks my heart each time you
Darling
You break my heart each time you
You slip your hands inside my pockets
Tell me nothing else would do
Without me, you can't live and
You slip your heart into my chest
They both become one of the strongest pairs
When strangers come
And darling
This thing that breaks my heart and
Darling
You break my heart each time you
Darling
This thing that breaks my heart and
Darling
You break my heart each time you---Lyrics submitted by Amy.
