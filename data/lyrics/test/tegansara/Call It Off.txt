I won't regret saying this, this thing that I am saying
Is it better then keeping my mouth shut, that goes without saying

Call break it off
call break my own heart

Maybe I would of been something you were good at
Maybe you would of been something I'd be good at
But now we'll never know
i won't be sad but in case i'll go there, Everyday
to make myself feel bad, theres a chance i'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do

I won't be, I won't but I'll still think it better if
you take your time coming over here I'll think thats for the best

Call break it off
call break my own heart
Maybe I would of been something you were good at
Maybe you would of been something I'd be good at
But now we'll never know
i won't be sad but in case i go there, Everyday
to make myself feel bad, theres a chance i'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do---Lyrics submitted by Janine.
