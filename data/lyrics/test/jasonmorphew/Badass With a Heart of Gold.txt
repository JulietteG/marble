Desdemona was married to a Southern Baptist preacher,
But she dreamed about the open road
She told him it was over and she left him in October
For a badass with a heart of gold, heart a gold
Everybody wanna hold a badass with a heart of gold

Randy was a ranger and his wife she was a stranger,
She was pretty, but her hands were cold
He told that he loved her and he set out to discover
A badass with a heart of gold, heart a gold
Everybody wanna hold a badass with a heart of gold

Fanina was a nun, after marrying the Son,
He just got to save her soul
Her body was on fire for a tenor in the choir
He was a badass with a heart of gold, heart a gold
Everybody wanna hold a badass with a heart of gold

Midnight, moonlight and magic
A genius wearing tight blue jeans
Just might inspire something drastic
Like believing you can realize your dreams

Tune into any station, any city in the nation
If  the singer's saddled then you know
He was walking on the wire but he fell into the fire
For a badass with a heart of gold, heart a gold
Everybody wanna hold a badass with a heart of gold.---Lyrics submitted by jamesdbrian.
