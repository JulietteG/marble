for years I've seen you fighting
against your heart
living like you're dying
so far from the sun
waiting for a guardian angel
to lead you through the dangers
that lie ahead your way
towards tomorrows arms

tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days
you're hiding yourself away from our cruel world's embrace
and as your days turn to weeks
you'll cry yourself to sleep in the cage

we all have our fears but yours are the scariest of them all
lift your head and let us taste
the horror you adore
and it all starts  to make sense 
all the blood wisely shed
just wait until the cure comes knocking on your door

tears have turned from sweet to sour and hours to days
your hiding yourself away 
from our cruel world's embrace
and as your days turn to weeks 
you'll cry yourself to sleep in the cage
in the cage you've locked yourself in---Lyrics submitted by rania.
