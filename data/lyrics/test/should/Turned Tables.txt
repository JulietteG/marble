on the phone you were dull
at the first hint of snow
we were never quite right
hope was never enough

but we had it that day
and Im always amazed
that you started to say
as the light pulled away

floating to the stars above
falling in and out of love
daylight would have to wait
fading on the longest day

but in only a month
wed be honest enough
that the fight was all gone
and her highness had won

though I know its quite late
and the tables have turned
and its never the same
as that day on the run

floating to the stars above
falling in and out of love
daylight would have to wait
fading on the longest day---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
