In front of the idiot box again
Pass me the remote control
Been so long since weve been out with friends
Someone to free my soul

Lets go to a club lets get out tonight
Well dance til tomorrows early daylight

Dont wanna sit around all night
Want you to take me out
I cant lay around all night
Want you to take me out

Sit around twiddling thumbs
bored out of my head
Sick of wasting, I wanna have fun
We can sleep when were dead

Lets go to a club lets get out tonight
Well dance til tomorrows early daylight

Dont wanna sit around all night
Want you to take me out
I cant lay around all night
Want you to take me out

Take me where well be wild and free
Thats the place I wanna be
Take me where we can scream and shout
I just want you to take me out

Dont wanna sit around all night
Want you to take me out
I cant lay around all night
Want you to take me out

Dont wanna sit around all night
Want you to take me out
I cant lay around all night
Want you to take me out---Lyrics submitted by Robb Kottmyer.
