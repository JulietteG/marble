In the beginning
There was a whole lotta nothin
(But the) Fluguls are a yearning
For some learning

So they went touring
In outerspace exploring
(Then) they went to Zoinkaboink
In their Monsterpox

(And they say) La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da, La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da 

The goofy Maladroits
Are sure not from Detroit
(so) off they go bouncing
And bouncing around

(And they say) La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da, La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da

They make lots-o-friends
In the universe
They travel for knowledge
And they meet the Berks

(And they say) La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da, La-di-da-di-da
La-di-da-di-da---Lyrics submitted by Robb Kottmyer.
