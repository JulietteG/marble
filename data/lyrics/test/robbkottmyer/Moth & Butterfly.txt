(Your the) beautiful grace of the butterfly
I am the nocturnal moth
(Your) radiance reaches up to the sky
I borough in your heart

How did this gift befall on you
Forever bask in the bright
In the darkness, I am to be
A counterpart to the light

Moth & Butterfly
Moth & Butterfly
When we metamorphosize
Im the moth, your the butterfly

You flutter in your color parade
Arrogance is you friend
You revel in how you are made
 Itll get you in the end
Your the object of every childs eye
But when were caught by the net
I am released back to the earth
Your a jar forever to fret

Moth & Butterfly
Moth & Butterfly
When we metamorphosize
Im the moth, your the butterfly

My name is black and yours is white
My day is dark, yours filled with light
We both have wings and can take flight
Look with octogonal sight
Seems that I cant win this fight
Though I try with all my might

My name is black and yours is white
My day is dark, yours filled with light
We both have wings and can take flight
Look with octogonal sight
Spend my time filled with spite
You spend your days in pure delight
Seems that I cant win this fight
Though I try with all my might

Ill live as the moth
Youll die the butterfly
Ill live as the moth
Youll die the butterfly

Moth & Butterfly
Moth & Butterfly
When we metamorphosize
Im the moth, your the butterfly---Lyrics submitted by Robb Kottmyer.
