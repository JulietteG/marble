I, I, I, I,
Oh, why, oh, why

Tell me deh pan mi mind
Why, oh, why, oh, why 
Why, Oh, why

[Verse 1:]
See your smile got me high and
A'm begging to be part of your sky
I will fly 747, 24/7
What am I sayin'? Hyperventilating, 
Wanting to be the game that you've been playing.

[Chorus:]
I, I, I, I'm all over sexy
My, my, my, my you haffi work it baby
Why, oh, why, oh, why you keep me waiting?
Hy, hy, hy, hypervetilating

[Verse 2:]
Tek yuh time join di line fi knock mi door
Rock mi body till you cyan't rock it no more
And it you ready you fi really mek mi soar
Like a bird in the sweet summer shore
And if you never know say dat mi want you do
Step aside cause supmn must do you
You either will or you won't 
You do or you don't better play me ritght hit every note.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Oh why, oh why, you deh pan mi mind?
Can you tell me why, why you deh pan mi mind, mind, mind?
My yute, tell you di truth
Mi want everything package up inna you suit
You deh pan mi mind and mi ready fi recruit
Show me weh you got if you want me salute.
I know you're watching me, me 
Cause I've been watching you, you
And if you didn't know I'm ready for you

[Chorus]
