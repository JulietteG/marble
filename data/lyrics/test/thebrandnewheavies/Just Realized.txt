Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I dont' know why I love you,
But I love you.

Always treat me like a fool.
Kick when I'm down..
That's your rule.
I don't know why I love.
But I love ya.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, you never never stop your cheatin' ways
with that other girl,
You laugh in my face
Now how long must I be disgraced,
cause I love ya?

Baby, baby, baby, baby..

I don't know why I love you.
I don't know why
Why I love you
I don't know why I love you...
But I love you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You threw my heart down in the dirt.
You made me cry,
On this cold, black earth, baby.
I never knew how much love could hurt,
'til I loved ya.

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
Can't stop, I can't stop cryin'
Can't you see?
Here I'm pleadin' on my knees,
Upon my knees.
Won't you help me?
Help me, baby please?
Cause I love ya.
I love you, I love you
Oh baby.
Baby, baby please stop
Baby, baby please stop
can't you see I'm on my knees
Why won't you just help me please?
Baby just please
Baby just stop, 

baby, baby please.
I love you, love you, love you,
love you, love you, love you, love you,
love you, baby
Oh
I can't take it no more baby
Makes me want to scream.
Oh---Lyrics submitted by Seatta.
