Here we are, out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets.
Two Sleepy People
By dawn's early light,
And too much in love To say, "Good night."
Here we are, in the cozy chair
Pickin' on a wishbone
From the Frigidaire,
Two Sleepy People With nothing to say,
And too much in love to break away.

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all.
Do you remember
The reason why we married in the fall?
To get a little rest
To get this little nest.
Here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella,
Drowsy little dame.
Two Sleepy People
By dawn's early light,
And too much in love To say, "Good night."

Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father didn't like you at all.
Do you remember
The reasons why we married in the fall?
To get a little rest
To get this little nest.
Here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella,
Drowsy little dame.
Two Sleepy People
By dawn's early light,
And too much in love To say, "Good night."
And too much in love To say, "Good night."---Lyrics submitted by simonsays.
