Leading you astray, keeping you in play 
and youre starting to fall, starting to fall
Playing with your mind, making you feel fine 
and youre starting to fall; fall
Im an actor with the lead; 
I designed the clothes you see; 
now youre talking to me, talking to;
Professor of the mind, I invented time, 
now youre talking to me

The stupid game is the word you play, 
yeah you do, with you Ill be the lover that you dont want to be,
but you already feel how you do... Oh oh

Fake from the start, we do all this stuff, just to get with you, just to get with you 
Fake from the start, we do all this stuff, just to get with you, just to get with you Oh oh...

Im a bum with a Ph.D. Im a doctor Yes indeed; 
now youre talking to me, talking to, 
Im the boss of a company; Im a champion of a football league; 
now youre talking to me 

The stupid game is the word you play,
yeah you do, with you Ill be the lover that you dont want to be,
but you already feel how you do... 

Fake from the start, we do all this stuff, 
just to get with you, just to get with you 
Fake from the start, we do all this stuff, 
just to get with you, just to get with you Oh oh

The stupid game is the word you play, 
yeah you do, with you Ill be the lover that you dont want to be, 
but you already feel how you do... Oh No Oh!

Fake from the start, we do all this stuff, 
just to get with you, just to get with you Oh..
Fake from the start, we do all this stuff, 
just to get with you, just to get with you---Lyrics submitted by Soleeii.
