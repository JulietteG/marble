Time has come for me to say goodbye
And I wanted you to know  
Time has come for me to make a change
And I wanted you to know

You've been waiting for something that I hide
You've been patient you supported my
Dream of gettting out
Free from all them clowns
Dream of gettting out
And always be on my own

Time has come for old things to revive 
I wanted you to know
Time has come the old me still alive
And I wanted you to know

You've been waiting for something that I hide
You've been patient you supported my

Dream of gettting out
Free from all them clowns
Dream of gettting out
And always be on my own---Lyrics submitted by Catherine Stam Berry.
