Rub me tight, hold me...
That's right, you know I need my
That's right, you know I need my
In the morning and night I need my
Oh, I know you know!
To put on your baby voice, girl...
you are my .. choice, girl.

Chorus: 
I need you to squeeze
Hop that shoulders and knees
Oh baby I know you can
You're kicking like the kind of girl
Switch it up, switch it up
Switch it up like a mad man
Squeeze that shoulders and knees
Oh baby, I know you can
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got the climax you're the 

Check out my...
Have you seen what you do
Hold my scene, I want you to...
Taste the fruits, have a drink for my...
Oh, I know you know!
Hey, ...bend over
Have the slightly look over
You're lucky like a four leaf clover 
Oh, I need you to

Chorus: 
I need you to squeeze
Hop that shoulders and knees
Oh baby I know you can
You're kicking like the kind of girl
Switch it up, switch it up
Switch it up like a mad man
Squeeze that shoulders and knees
Oh baby, I know you can
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got the climax you're the one!

You are my lady, baby
You are my lady!

Chorus:
I need you to squeeze
Hop that shoulders and knees
Oh baby I know you can
I need you to squeeze
Hop that shoulders and knees
Oh baby I know you can
I need you to squeeze
Hop that shoulders and knees
Oh baby I know you can
Hey, hey, hey
I got the climax you're the one!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
