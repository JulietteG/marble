Looked out my window
down the block
no snow on my street
East coast folks are making snowmen
but thats fine with me

no snow calls
no chestnuts rustling
got snow cars
dont need now mansion

maybe a sweater for the evening time
cause we're out and its warm outside

its a california christmas
you can go outside and ride your new bike
its a california christmas
and nobody wants to stay inside
cuz' its a beautiful day and the sun is shining the family's all here and the baby's winning---Lyrics submitted by Briana.
