Out from my window across from the city
I have what's considered a good view
Two blocks from the subway, three from the fountain
Where I walk to break in the new shoes

She stands on the sidewalk just waving at taxis
Like horses in parades in passing
I ask where she's headed she tells me
"Ohio, I've not seen my mother in ages"

"It's been a long time, a real long time
A real long time"

Out from my window how far is Ohio?
She laughed and pointed out east
She said, "I grew up there with my dear mother
And I haven't seen her since thirteen"

"You see, I was taken while she lay sleeping
By my father's hired man
We moved to city so far from my family
I haven't been back there since"

"It's been a long time, a real long time
A real long time"

Out from my window please hear me Ohio
Your daughter wants to come home
She longs to be with you, to hug you to kiss you
To never leave her alone

And I've gotten to know her to live with to love her
It's hard to see her leave
She belongs to her mother and the state of Ohio
I wish she belonged to me

See you sometime, see you sometime
See you sometime---
