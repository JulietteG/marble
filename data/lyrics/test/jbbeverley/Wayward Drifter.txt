Yeah the wind swept in through the trees like a train through this old town
and now that everybody's gone, that heartaches comes around
Tonight the moon just will not shine and i can see the stars
I got nothing to think about except this broken heart

Yeah the one I love has gone away cause she could not be true
So i packed some things took off my ring, and put on them walking shoes
I headed out the door like I done before but this time with a plan
I'm gonna pick some tunes by the light of the moon just roaming 'round this land

And i'll be that Wayward Drifter walkin down the railroad tracks
now Lord if i get gone, I'm ramblin on, and i aint looking back
And from switch yard with this old guitar and I'm a heading to your town, 
And i'll a sing you a song, play all night long  but i can't stick around

Another town gone another lonely song another endless mile
Now I can always stay and change my ways but that just ain't my style
Now you can tempt me with eternity of love and gold sunshine but in the end i'm my only friend
And I'll tell you one more time 

That I'll be that Wayward Drifter walkin down the railroad tracks
Lord if i get gone, I'm ramblin on, and i aint looking back
From switch yard with this old guitar and I'm heading to your town,
And i'll a sing you a song, play all night long but i can't stick around

I guess I'll keep on walking and a-hopping on these old trains
cause with my six string and without that ring i ain't got no complaints
I'd love to spend another night, with every one of you
But i love the feel of rumbling steel and I gotta push on through

And i'll be that Wayward Drifter walkin down the railroad tracks
Lord if i get gone, ramblin on, I might not make it back
So from switch yard with this old guitar and im a heading to your town, 
And i'll a sing you a song, play all night long  but i can't stick around---Lyrics submitted by Don Wawaayea Grey Day.
