I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal

You should see my Iowan gal

I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal

you may try to win her but you never will pal
my purebred, corn fed Iowan gal

I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal

shes pretty as a picture,happy as a clam
pinch me and tell me how lucky I am

you may try to win her but you never will pal
my purebred, corn fed Iowan gal

I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal

well you should see my Iowan gal

I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal

shes got a round bottem that I like to spank
it quilt me up a kasmir blank,its pretty as a picture,happy as a clam
pinch me and tell me how lucky I am

you may try to win her but you never will pal
my purebred, corn fed Iowan gal

I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal

well you should see my Iowan gal

I got me an iowan gal
I got me an iowan gal

shes the sweetest thing this side of Des moines
she cooks up a mighty fine pork loin
so hop on an airplane catch a train pal
get yourself a purebred, corn fed Iowan gal

you should see my Iowan gal---Lyrics submitted by trevor.
