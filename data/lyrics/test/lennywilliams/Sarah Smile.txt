Sara,Sara,Sara

Baby hair with a woman's eyes
And I can feel you watchin' in the night
All alone in me 
I'm waitin' for the sunlight

My baby, when I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel that I can't go on
you come and hold me
It's you and me forever, Sara

Smile, why don't you smile
A while for me Sara?
Sara smile, why don't you smile
a while for me Sara, baby?

If you feel like leavin', you know, you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow
If you wanna be free, you know
All you got to do is say so

My baby, when you feel cold, I will warm you
And when you feel that you can't go on
I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever, Sara

Smile, smile for me, baby
When you do, everything's alright
Smile, Sara, baby
Smile a while, baby
Everything's alright

Sara smile
Sara smile
