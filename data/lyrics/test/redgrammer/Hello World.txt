Chorus:
Hello World! My old friend
It's another day, I'm glad to see you again
The sun is up, I'm ready to play
Hello World! So what do you say?

There are bikes to ride, frogs to find
Forts to build, trees to climb
Dolls to dress, beads to string
Teams to choose, and songs to sing

(Chorus)

There are games to play, ducks to feed
Berries to pick, books to read
Fish to catch, friends to meet
Jokes to tell, cookies to eat

(Chorus)

(Instrumental chorus)

(Double Chorus)

Hello World! So what do you say?---Lyrics submitted by kayeleigh lautn.
