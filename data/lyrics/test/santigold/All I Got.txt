I should ask but I don't want to know
How you get something for nothing at all
Build an empire for yourself
Don't take this personal, go to hell

You want it, you got it
Come get it, I'll see you there
You want it, you got it
Come get it

Put all I got in your way
I'll put all I got in your way
Put all I got in your way
I'll put all I got in your way

Dum dum dum da dum da dum heya
Dum dum dum da heya heya heya
Dum dum dum da dum da dum heya
Dum dum dum da heya heya heya

Why should I perspire the most
I cut 'em down, you play the post
Make believe, live your motto
Surround yourself with smarter folk

You want it, you got it
Come get it, I'll see you there
You want it, you got it
Come get it

Put all I got in your way
I'll put all I got in your way
Put all I got in your way
I'll put all I got in your way

I'm here scraping away, still no trace of dignity
Crowd's out, they got it hard for 'em
So devout, they'll take an eye for it
I live for the grim encore, say no more

Put all I got in your way (Im gonna knock you down, baby)
Ill put all I got in your way (Aint gonna leave ya til I bring you down low)
Put all I got in your way (Not gon get ahead now, cant get ahead now)
Ill put all I got in your way (Im gonna bring you right down to your knees)
Put all I got in your way (Im gonna knock you down, baby)
Ill put all I got in your way (Aint gonna leave ya til I bring you down low)
Put all I got in your way (Not gon get ahead now, cant get ahead now)
Ill put all I got in your way (Cant get ahead now, cant get ahead now)

Dum dum dum da dum da dum heya
Dum dum dum da heya heya heya
Dum dum dum da dum da dum heya
Dum dum dum da heya heya heya---
