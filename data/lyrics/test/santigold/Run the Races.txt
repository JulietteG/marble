Hello, what is going on something strange
Where do I go, it's coming round to meet me
I've gone around the world two times to find something to save me here
But these days, it seems I'm of a different kind

It may not be safe but can't hide from what will come
And it may not be sane but I'm going out there
It may not be made for me
Lord knows what I will dare to find
But these days you can't run from the races

I said who told you could get a piece of my heart
Cuz' you see I'm no runaway
So go ahead, I'm gonna give you a head start

Hello, I've come a long way to find this place
And what it's come to, build it all on body not faith
Say it'll be that tie you break when the hallowed spark will find you
So if I wanna steep up the dream gotta take my place out on the line

It may not be safe but can't hide from what will come
And it may not be sane but I'm going out there
It may not be made for me
Lord knows what I will dare to find
But these days you can't run from the races

I said who told you could get a piece of my heart
Cuz' you see I'm no runaway
So go ahead, I'm gonna give you a head start

Steady don't ease up get in my game
Can you see me now lookin' both ways
All night dreamin I'd taken the race

Headin' out, do you not see in my face
I'm not playin' I'm 'a push it all day
Head down, feet forward edge of my faith---
