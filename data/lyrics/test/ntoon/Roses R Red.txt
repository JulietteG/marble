VERSE 1: just 2 konw that i will see you today
makes me wake up early just 2 see your face 
makes that bus ride to school seem a okay
girl i never felt this way 
i never been in love (to know just how it feels)
everytime i see you girl my heart beats are real

HOOK: so if roses are red and violets are blue 
girl what im trying 2 say i think that im in love with you

COURSE: roses are red and violets are blue 
girl im not sure but i think that im in love with you 
with you thats ryte thats ryte im not sure but i think im in love with you

VERSE 2: its kind of strange to me now i know what 2 say 
untill i see your face and then my mind just go blank
the butterflies then come and then my knees get waek
girl i can hardly speak
as crazy as it seems i dont want school to end
so that i can stare at you and just pretend

HOOK: so if roses are red and violets are blue 
girl what im trying 2 say i think that im in love with you

COURSE: roses are red and violets are blue 
girl im not sure but i think that im in love with you 
with you thats ryte thats ryte im not sure but i think im in love with you
