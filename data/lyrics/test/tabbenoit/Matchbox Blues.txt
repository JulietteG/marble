Last night I dreamed that I was lucky
But I woke up cold in hand
Yeah, last night I dreamed that I was lucky
But I woke up cold in hand

I dreamed I had you by myself
But I believe you got another man

Sometime I wonder
Will a matchbox hold my clothes?
Yes, sometime I wonder
Will a matchbox hold my clothes?

I ain't got so many
But I got so far to go

(Guitar solo)

Sometime I wonder
Will a matchbox hold my clothes?
Yeah, sometimes I wonder
Will a matchbox hold my clothes?

You see, I ain't got so many
But I got so far to go (so far, yeah)---Lyrics submitted by B Lindenschmidt.
