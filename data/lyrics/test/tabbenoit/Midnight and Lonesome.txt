There's a world less moon watchin' tonight.
There's a garden that's left to grow wild
There's a sound with no name when a far away train
Cries like an unloved child

The paint on the wall is peeling away
There's a photograph that fades on the shelf
The memory stays on of a love that's gone 
I'm dancing by myself

Oh why, why I want to know
When she left me no where to go
Why, why tell me my friend 
It's midnight and lonesome again

Instrumental

The moons still lonely I wonder sometime
If that's why the train had to cry
So I ask why out loud there's no answer now
I'm just talking to the sky

Now morning its time to get ready 
Then the evening take off your shoes
Well you worked hard all day
The suns gone away 
And midnight lays claim to the blues

Why, why I want to know
She went left me no where to go
Why, why wont tell me my friend 
It's midnight and lonesome again

Instrumental

Why, why I want to know
She went left me no where to go
Why, why wont you tell me my friend 
It's midnight and lonesome again
It's midnight and lonesome again---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
