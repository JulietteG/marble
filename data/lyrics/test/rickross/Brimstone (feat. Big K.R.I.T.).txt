Hey dog, we always been self made men you feel me?
So you know what I'm sayin'
Ross could stand on his own you feel me?
So just keep goin' dog hit that billionaire status
And you know when I get there dog
You know what I'm sayin'
We're gonna sit back and eat fish dinners
No crab meat, you know what I mean?

I say lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down

I say lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down

There'll be hard times, and then song
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name

There'll be hard times, and then songs
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
I say lord, lord lord lord lord

Lord lord lord lord
I remember hard times always found a way to smile
It was quiet, Christmas time
No pretty lights around the house
They told me I was loud, didn't fit into they crowd
Mama need a spouse, Daddy always in and out
Age 15 so the caged bird sings
One year later seen a straight bird clean
All glitters ain't gold
These evil niggas prayin' for your soul
Walkin' through the fire, Hell on God's green Earth
Take a seat, close your eyes, bow your head, say chuch

Lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down

There'll be hard times, and then songs
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
I say lord, lord lord lord lord

Lord lord lord lord
I'm sittin' in the trap and now done did it with the best
Pull a double shift its time to get your boy some rest
Money on my mind, alcohol on my breath
On the road to riches as I stumble every step
Gold on my arm, gold on my neck
But whats in my heart I will cherish till the death
Same rainy days, but things never change
Prayin' to my maker just to take away this pain
Walkin' through the fire, Hell on God's green Earth
Take a seat, close your eyes, bow your head, say chuch

Lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down

There'll be hard times, and then songs
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
I say lord, lord lord lord lord

Lord, lord lord lord lord
I pray I don't be here
When it all goes down, when it all goes down

There'll be hard times, and then songs
Fire, and brimstones
Devil world from which you came
I pray that God will know my name
I say lord, lord lord lord lord---
