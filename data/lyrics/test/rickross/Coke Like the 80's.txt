Okay last time, this is drugs 
This is your brain on drugs 
Any questions? 

Welcome home George Jung (RIP McBride) 
The real Boston George 
It's that Dade Country yayo shit 
Double MOB 
I'm finny take these pussy niggas down 
Beat Billionaire 

I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, in my all white Mercedes 
I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, in my coke white Mercedes 

All white, nigga, Big Ike, nigga 
Keep shooters with me, you'll call your gravesite nigga 
15th Ave, miracle nigga 
Get [?], come and get a few nigga 
John Doe nigga, you know that convo 
Get you that weed and white, want you a combo nigga 
Checkmate with the sticks, identify by your kicks 
Welcome home to Skinner, already bought him a brick 
Boobie Gang was the clique, forever changed the game 
Bunky Brown was a legend, Wayne Parker the mane (Vonda) 
Carol City success, 183rd still a rout 
We live in the jungle, fishtanks in the house 

I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, in my all white Mercedes 
I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, in my coke white Mercedes 

Bo dealin' nigga, oh really nigga? 
Bunche Park hot, it's a block full of killas 
Lil' Trav, nigga 
Execution upcomin', 'bout that lil' tab nigga 
River City, they slide, aka homicide 
Rest in peace to the Goonies, one day we'll be eye to eye 
It is what it is, I left the vest at the crib 
Extended the clip, I'ma give 'em the biz 
Catch you jackin' your dick, now you fucked in the game 
Leave you flat on your back, where you lay was a stain 
A mil' in the hole is every real nigga goal 
And this uncut like Ochoa, they want your crumbs off the floor 

I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, in my all white Mercedes 
I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, in my coke white Mercedes 

My new bitch, she a waitress, strip club is a trap 
Stick my dick in her pussy when she come sit on my lap 
Get that paper, my plug, he sent that pack from Bahamas 
It's uncut like the 80's, 17 still my number 
Candy paint on my donk, Jesus piece on my charm 
She just wanted a bump 
Her man wanted a line, so I sold 'em a verse 
Sold a quarter for 9, and I sold 'em the vert 
Can't be takin' them trips, for that flea market whip 
Peep this Rollie fugazy, I'm sellin' game to a pimp 
Line up all of my bitches, head crack 'em and check 'em 
Even if she barefooted, I bet the streets gon' respect her 

I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, in my all white Mercedes 
I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's 
I got coke like the 80's, in my coke white Mercedes ---
