Many years have passed, I'm sorry to say.
Since I've been to visit my Daddy's grave.
When the telephone rang, I heard sister say.
Green briars are growing on our Daddy's grave.
I went to the place where my Daddy laid.
And saw the green briar growing up through the clay.
So I took me a spade and I took me a hoe.
Cleared away the green briar, planted Daddy a rose.
In life Dad's a briar and Mom's are the rose.
But In death there's no difference God only knows.
Sometimes at midnight when the cold wind blows.
I think of the graveyard and my Daddy's rose.
I went to place where my Daddy laid .
And saw the green briar growing up through the clay.
So I took me a spade and I took me a hoe.
Cleared away the green briar, planted Daddy a rose.
I long for the spring time when the rose will bloom.
And cast it's shadows on my Daddy's tomb.
So listen good people to these words I say.
Keep the green briars off of your Daddy's grave.
I went to the place where my Daddy laid.
And saw the green briars growing up through the clay.
So I took me a spade and I took me a hoe.
Cleared away the green briar, planted Daddy a rose.---Lyrics submitted by Mitchell Gibson.
