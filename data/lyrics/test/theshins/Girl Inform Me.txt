Girl inform me all my senses warn me 
Your clever eyes could easily disguise 
Some backwards purpose 
It's enough to make me nervous. 
Do you harbor sighs, or spit in my eye 

But your lips when we speak 
Are the valleys and peaks of a mountain range on fire. 
So let me walk these coals till you believe 
I can cut the mustard well enough 
Cause you know as soon as breathe we scrutinize 

Unknown quotients, you must be using potions 
How else could you tie my head to the sky 
This new convection has left me wondering why 
I can't concern myself with ordinary tripe. 

Like what's this morning's paper got to say 
And which brand of coffee to make 
This is no umbrella to take into the wind 
And before we begin is there nothing to kill this anxiety. 

But your lips when we speak 
Are the valleys and peaks of a mountain range on fire. 
So let me walk these coals till you believe 
I can cut the mustard well enough 
Cause you know as soon as breathe we scrutinize 
The paint away.---Lyrics submitted by katherine.
