As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn 
We settle down to cut ourselves apart. 
Cough and twitch from the news on your face 
And some foreign candle burning in your eyes 

Held to the past too aware of the pending 
Chill as the dawn breaks and finds us up for sale. 
Enter the fog another low road descending 
Away from the cold lust, you house and summertime. 

Blind to the last cursed affair pistols and countless eyes 
A trail of white blood betrays the reckless route your craft is running 
Feed till the sun turns into wood dousing an ancient torch 
Loiter the whole day through and lose yourself in lines dissecting love. 

Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay 
Offer me little but doting on a crime. 
We've turned every stone and for all our inventions 
In matters of love loss, we've no recourse at all. 

Blind to the last cursed affair pistols and countless eyes 
A trail of white blood betrays the reckless route your craft is running 
Feed till the sun turns into wood dousing an ancient torch 
Loiter the whole day through and lose yourself in lines dissecting love.---Lyrics submitted by Derrick.
