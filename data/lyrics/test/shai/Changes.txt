Oh, everybody goes through changes, yes
Oh, changes baby

You know, lately I've been going through changes
And sometimes, you just gotta let go
But before you leave the one you love
Just make sure you're sure

I was in a situation, it was a little too much for me
To handle all the pressure that one can get
When you were too in love

I was always falling in and out and in and out of love
There were emotions so strong
And sometimes you just gotta let go, yeah

Many times before I felt all alone
I know life's unfair but girl I'm true to myself
Baby can't you see you've been hurting me?
Now, just let me walk out of the door (Baby I'm gone)

Everybody goes through changes
Sometimes you gotta let go
But before you leave the one you love
Just make sure that you don't wanna come back for more

Everybody goes through changes
Sometimes you gotta let go
But before you leave the one you love
Just make sure that you're sure

And though I've been having some problems
I don't know which way to go
'Cause everyone has their way
Of dealing with the things they do, oh

And I was always looking for excuses everywhere
Acting like I didn't care
But now I'm searching for somebody new
So, leave me alone girl

Many times before I felt all alone
I know life's unfair but girl I'm true to myself
Baby can't you see, you've been hurting me
Now, just let me walk right out of the door

Everybody goes through changes
Sometimes you gotta let go
But before you leave the one you love
Make sure that you don't wanna come back for more

Everybody goes through changes
Sometimes you gotta let go
But before you leave the one you love
Just make sure that you're sure

Everybody goes through changes
Sometimes you gotta let go
But before you leave the one you love
Just make sure that you don't wanna come back for more

Everybody goes through changes
Sometimes you gotta let go
But before you leave the one you love
Just make sure that you're sure

Gotta let you go
Gotta let you go---Lyrics submitted by Jenniffer.
