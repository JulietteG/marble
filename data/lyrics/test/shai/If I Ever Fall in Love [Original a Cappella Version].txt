Ohhh da da dohh dohh ohhh da da dohh ohh
Ohhh da da dohh dohh

Verse one:
The very first time that I saw your brown eyes
your lips said hello & I said hi I knew right there
you were the one, but I was caught up eh in physical attraction
but to my satisfaction baby you  were more than just a face 

Chorus:
And if I ev ever fall in love again
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ev ever fall in love so true
I will be sure that the lady's just like you

Solo skit: 
Yeah baby yeah, my my my my my my the very
next time she will be my friend

Verse two:
If I say that I could be your one & only
Promise that you'll never me lonely
I just wanna be the one you need
oh baby
I just wanna be the one to serve you
Sometimes I feel as if I don't deserve you
I'll cherish every moment that we share

(Chorus)

My friend
The very next time she will be my friend someone who I could believe in
My friend
Very next time she will be my friend
My friend ohhhh!
The very next time she will be my friend someone who I can believe in
My friend
very next time she will be my friend
