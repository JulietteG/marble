Yes I was there, nobody stared
(I) Held my Direction

I had a chance, I couldve made it better
but I lacked inspiration

And then you know
I'm much to slow
Could use your prescription

Someone to lend a hand, help me understand
Just what was requested

And I can see you
And I can see the way you lie

Id like to be kind
But then I can't get through it 
I-
I'm going out of my mind

Well would they Follow The Leader?

(x2)

Well would they Follow The Leader?
I say would they Follow the Leader?
I don't want they* Follow the Leader

(*them to)---Lyrics submitted by Emil Tapio.
