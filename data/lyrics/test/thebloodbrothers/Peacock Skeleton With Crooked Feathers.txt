If the sea shakes like an empty maraca, yeah.
and, I know, I know, I know, I know.
And, she falls in love with the sounds of ships sinking?
and, I know, I know, I know, I know.

Which peacock is beast? Which peacock is priest?
If the heavens part
nobody, nowhere, nothing.
Every apartment is vacant, every home for rent?
Hey, Peacock?
What's that?
I just wanna know what those feathers are made out of
is it bruises or roses or cradles or coffins.
Oh, it's all those!
Which peacock is beast? Which peacock is priest?

Your friends are all cripple, all wither, all wilt
and, I know, I know, I know, I know.
And you smile at their pain, from your angel bone stilts.
I know, I know, I know, I know.
Which peacock is beast? Which peacock is priest?

If the brick you throw
puts a bullet in your skull
police boot lands atop your gaping jaw.
Hey, Peacock?
Yeah, what's that?
I just wanna know what the babies mouth is full of.
Is it flies, or cries, or straw?
Which peacock is beast? Which peacock is priest?
Which peacock's police? Which peacock is thief?

If machine guns come knock-knock-knockin',
who's cashing out your bad luck?
Wedding bells sound like death knells, baby
is a wealthy groom worth all it's gloom?
Tuxedos slither off corpses,
and copulate wild on wedding cake
and the priest starts snapping photos?
And, there's a peacock on your shoulder
pole dancing around your neck
while reciting the Book of Revelation.

So who do you love?
Who do you trust?
When your friend's take a match to your front lawn?
A panicked face makes the peacock proud.
So who do you love? 
Who do you trust? 
Who do you kill when your senator drags out your first born?
A panicked face makes the peacock proud.

If the forest turns to static, and the black branches, too?
and, I know, I know, I know, I know.
Your body starts to fall into a concrete tutu?
I know, I know, I know, I know.
Which peacock is beast? Which peacock is priest?

If you strike for better wages at the cola factory,
and they drink champagne;
as they kick in your teeth?
Hey, Peacock?
Yeah, what's that?
I just wanna know what that blood tasted like.
Was it sugar or vinegar or Whiskey or Dirt? (It's all of those.)
Which peacock is beast? Which peacock is priest?

If machine guns go knock-knock-knocking',
Who's crashing out your bad luck?
If wedding bells sound like death knells, baby
Is a wealthy groom worth all his gloom?
Tuxedos slither off corpses
and capulate wild on the wedding cake,
and the priest starts snapping photos,
there's a peacock on his shoulder,
pole dancing around your neck
while reciting the Book of Revelation

Things are never what they seem.
The peacocks static harmonies.

The peacock spreads it's crooked feather.
(Static harmonies)(4x)

So who do you love? 
Who do you trust?
When your friends take a match to your front lawn.
A panicked face that makes a peacock proud.
So who do you love?
Who do you trust?
Who do you kill when your senator drags out your first born?
A panicked face that makes a peacock proud.---Lyrics submitted by Kennedy.
