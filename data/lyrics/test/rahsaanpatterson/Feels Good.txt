It's the dog in the park
It's the fog after dark
It's the wind in your hair
It's the keys that you left
After giving your best
It's the thought as I walk

It's like taking sips from your cup of coffee
Smoking a cigarette after dinner time
It's like making love on Egyptian cotton
all in all it
We'll be fine

Chorus :
Feels good
It feels good
Feels good
It feels good

So good
Feels so good
It feels so good
You know it feels so good

It's a song in your head
Eating chocolate in bed
It's a bird up in flight
A divine melody
Glass of wine
Burgundy
It's the love of your life
It's like

It's like taking sips from your cup of coffee
Smoking a cigarette after dinner time
It's like making love on Egyptian cotton
On and on and
We'll be fine

Chorus :
Feels good
(Feels good, you know)
It feels good
(You know it feels good)
Feels good
(Oh, you know it feels)
It feels good

No doubt
We got a love think
That's definitely here to stay
One thing I do have to say is
That in each and every way
Feels good
So good
So good

Chorus :
Feels good
(Hum, you know it feels)
It feels good
(Oh you know that)
Feels good
(Oh you know it feels good)
It feels good
Feels so good
Feels so good
Feels so good---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Cobb.
