(feat. Lyle Lovett)

Girls from Georgia are sweeter than peaches
Ones from California are mode for bathing suits and beaches
Minnesota gals sure fill out a sweater
But the girls from Texas are just a little bit better

Mississippis got all them delta queens
And Louisiana Cajun girls beat all Ive ever seen
Ever kiss a girl from Kansas you damn sure wont forget her
But the girls from Texas are just a little bit better

Feel the southern drawl from the ones in Arkansas
Theyre so sexy in New Mexico
But the only ten I see aint in Tennessee
Shes waiting for me in San Antonio

Up in Oklahoma theyre more than just OK
They dont come more fun than Alabama
But if you can find a lone-star gal boy you better getr
Cause the girls from Texas are just a little bit better

It dont get no finer than the girls in Carolina
Im talking North, Im talking south
But the only ten I see aint in Tennessee
In ol cow town

Up in Colorado they can melt snow
Out in Nevada theyre always putting on a show
New Yorks got the fashion, Floridas got the weather
But the girls from Texas are just a little bit better

Once you cross that red river hoss
Youll stay there forever
Cause the girls in Texas are just a little bit better---
