[Chorus - Ace Hood] 
Same old shit, just a different day 
Out here trying to get it, each and every way 
Momma need a house 
Baby need some shoes 
Times are getting hard 
Guess what I'ma do 

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard 

Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard 

[Verse 1 - Ace Hood] 
Okay, I'm booked out until August 
Show money deposits 
See the shit then I cop it 
Got but a house note in my pocket 
I'm on South Beach with that top off 
Bad bitch and her ass soft 
Something out of that catalogue 
She introduced to that lock jaw 
And I think her name was Lisa 
Or maybe it was Sheila 
My Chevy sitting too high 
I call that Wiz Khalifa 
And I'm all about them Ben Franklins 
Ain't talking Aretha 
Bitch my league too major 
I'm hip-hop Derek Jeter 
And I'm still feeling my pockets 
Big bass and it's knocking 
Yeah this be that remix 
But still ride around with that rocket 
Nigga welcome back to my household 
We the Best be that logo 
Hundred grand for that neck glow 
All about the deniero 
Nigga flow so retarded 
We be getting gnarley 
Whoa Kimosabe, it be me, Ross, Weezy, party because it's the 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross] 
24's on my Beamer 
You never know when I slide up 
Nineteen in my nina, red dot when I ride up 
Hundred deep in that K.O.D. 
King of diamonds that's me nigga 
No you bitches can't get my beat 
Choppers only thing free nigga 

Step to me and I teach you 
Somebody text his picture 
Straight drop in my beaker 
Ace knocking my speakers 
Last night I counted one mill' 
This morning one fifty 
Pussy niggas can't count me out, don't make me hurt your feelings 
V12, Jet Blue, forget it 
Rolex embedded with princess and baguettes 

Same old brick, but it's different yay 
Yeah that's candy paint, On my seven tre 

[Chorus - Lil Wayne] 

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne] 
Okay now, Black Card in my pocket 
Riding around in that 'Gatti 
Pistol off my boxers 
I ain't got time to be boxing 
Got a red bone she look tropic 
If she fuck me right, then she shopping 
Young Money we popping 
I eat these rappers, Anthony Hopkins 
See that V-neck, that's Polo 
Grilled up like Ocho 
Chuck Taylors with no socks 
You niggas chicken, pollo 
Nigga live on Sundays, king of diamonds Monday 
Swagger just dumb, call it Kelly Bundy 
Got a big house with a backyard, fish tank with sharks in it 
Real nigga I'm authentic 
I'll fuck the bitch till she short winded 
Got a bad bitch who be bartending 
Couple homies that gang bang 
I get on anybody track, and hit that bitch with that Wayne train 
Free my nigga T.I. 
Soowoo to the beehive 
Got a G6 and a G5 
You pussy niggas you feline 
Don't stop the party, we be getting gnarley 
Oh Kimosabe, I'm with Mack, few girls, and Marley 

Beause it's the same old shit, just a different day 
Out here trying to get it, each and every way 
Momma need a house, baby need some shoes 
They want that Carter IV, bitch it's coming soon
