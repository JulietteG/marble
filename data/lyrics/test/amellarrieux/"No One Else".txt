Swift as a wind song
You sang the music of an honest bird
I waited for some contradiction
But truth was ringing in your every word

And every moment since then
The one thing I can tell
Is that I belong with you
And no one else

Lay down those heavy burdens
On the banks of this river deep
Know that every piece of your past
Is always some place safe with me

And theres no room for judgment
I want you as yourself
Cuz I belong with you
And no one else

We have both been broken
Bent into painful shapes
We almost let those old fears
Carry over and get in our way
Every struggle just makes our love get stronger
Than it was yesterday

So here we are now
Aint it lucky we survived it all
Searching for self in separate rivers
Ending up in the same waterfall

And when were gray and wiser
The story I will tell
Is that I belonged with you
And no one else---Lyrics submitted by Smiley.
