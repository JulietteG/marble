I work hard for what I got
Plenty overtime
When I clock out Im worn and beat down
But still ready to fly
( here you come with those )
unsteady eyes
like you been looking for something you cannot find
right through me
like my fruit aint fit for makin pie

chorus
you got to 
earn my affection
put your back into it
before we get this show on the road
dont make me
lose all my self respect
I aint desperate yet so
come on now stop actin out and act like you know

youre a beautiful mess
but every attic has a treasure
and I been known, to throw my apron on
and scrub to reveal a shine
(let the good lord have)
mercy on you
before I do
if you were in the area and just passing through
come correctly, come strong and dont drag your good foot behind

chorus

you set a pretty table and serve me raw meat
ask me to the show but dont save me a seat
say together we can sail, then add me to your fleet
the perfect pair of pants are ruined with the 

addition-of-a-pleat
I demand a flat surface
Where I can 
Firmly-plant-my-feet
And stand
Its my democratic right to say man you should.---Lyrics submitted by Betty.
