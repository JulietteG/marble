Theres a chance for everybody
So I took my chance on lovin you, yeah
But no one man can make you happy
You wanna have your cake and eat it too

You wont give up your buttercup
You say you love 2 but 1 is givin up
cause he cant stay, no, no
Aw, you wont give up your buttercup
Your plenty for 1 but 2 youre not enough
And I cant stay

Rump, pump, pa pumpah pah dahbah

Ive a right to my opinion
Feeling wed be better off as friends
cause you cant make no one man happy
When youre spreading yourself much too thin, aw

You wont give up your buttercup
You say you love 2 but 1 is givin up
cause he cant stay, no, no
Aw, you wont give up your buttercup
Your plenty for 1 but 2 youre not enough
And I cant stay

Rump, pump, pa pumpah pah dahbah

Dit, dit.....etc..
Oh buttercup, well give it up
Na, na, na, na ,na, no
Oh buttercup
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no

You wont give up your buttercup
You say you love 2 but 1 is givin up
cause he cant stay, no, no
Aw, you wont give up your buttercup
Your plenty for 1 but 2 youre not enough
And I cant stay

Rump, pump, pa pumpah pah dahbah

Theres chance for even losers
cause I will find a love thats pure someday
Yeah, eeh, yeah, you will be the one whos bluer
Because your came of love no one will play

You wont give up your buttercup
You say you love 2 but 1 is givin up
cause he cant stay, no, no
Aw, you wont give up your buttercup
Your plenty for 1 but 2 youre not enough
And I cant stay
Ad-lib to end ....---Lyrics submitted by DaPaul.
