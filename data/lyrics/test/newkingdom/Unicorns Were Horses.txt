Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys...

Unicorns were horses
nowadays when I write the forces send me voices
got me runnin' through mazes
drivin down superhighways
phasin' phrases
My ways is
dangerous
on an open road
daddy still got me truckin' this heavy load
guess it just be's like that sometimes
guess it just be's like that sometimes

Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys

It's the same bat-time,
same bat-channel
Wasn't no thang everybody can't handle
Those who,
the chosen few
I come to testify,
showin' you,
so when we,
Sebastian and I
crack the sky
Will you be ready? It's do or die
I'm feelin' unsteady
I wanna explode
Open up the globe
We's in overaload.

Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys

Sometimes I feel all alone
On this highway
far from home
I never hold my hat
In a room at the side of the road
Late for dinner
But I'ma comin' home

Unicorns were horses
nowadays when I write the forces send me voices
got me runnin' through mazes
drivin down superhighways
phasin' phrases
my ways is
dangerous
on an open road
daddy still got me truckin' this heavy load
guess it just be's like that sometimes
guess it just be's like that sometimes

Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys... Hey you guyyys---Lyrics submitted by The Guvnah.
