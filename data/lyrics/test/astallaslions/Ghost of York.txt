I know, we're all souls just, trying, to connect with, someone, but we're all left, searching, on our own. On our own. On our own. On our ow-ow-own!

Tell me that you could hear it!
Three taps under the floorboard.
Don't say I'm losing it!
Maybe you're deaf. 
Could've sworn, that I locked, all these windows fairly tight.
Shut the door, hear a knock.
She starts turning off the lights.

CHORUS
From the corner of my eye, I saw you dressed all in white!
I saw you pass right by.
But maybe I had too much wine!
I hope you come back tonight, you never said goodbye.

Tell me that you could see it!
A ghost whose skin is porcelain.
Don't say I'm losing it!
Maybe you're blind.
Saw her walk through a wall. 
Turn her head and look at me.
In a York hotel hall.
I am falling to my knees.

CHORUS
From the corner of my eye, I saw you dressed all in white!
I saw you pass right by.
But maybe I had too much wine!
I hope you come back tonight, you never said goodbye.

Softly, as your dress flows.
You say, that you're alone.
I know, I can't leave you.
Lonely, and on your own.

(Tell me that you could hear it, Tell me that you could see it)
On your owwnn!

CHORUS
From the corner of my eye, I saw you dressed all in white!
I saw you pass right by.
But maybe I had too much wine!
I hope you come back tonight, you never said goodbye.
