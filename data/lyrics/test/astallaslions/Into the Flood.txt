All this time is ash and sand.
It's runnin' through my head.
So what if I don't, feel it. 
So what if I don't, see it.
~
Torn apart from limb to limb. 
I'm put in place again. 
So what if I don't, feel it.
So what if I don't, feel it.

Innocence is gone.
And you don't taste the same!
But I know that you don't, see it!
I know that you don't, see it!
Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh! Oh oh oh!
~
The steps between us is starting to show.
The space between us is starting to grow!
And I know that you don't ...
Yeah I know that you don't ...
Yeah I know that you don't !
Yeah I know that you don't, see it!
~
Ahhh oooh ohhh ......

All this time is ash and sand.
Runnin' through our heads.
So what if we don't, feel it?
So what if we don't, feel it?
Ohhhhh! Ohhhhh! Ohhhhhh!---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
