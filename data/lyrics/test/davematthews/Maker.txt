Oh, oh deep the water
Black and cold like the night
I stand with arms wide open
I run a twisted mile
I'm a stranger in the eyes of the maker

I could not see for the fog in my eyes
and I could not feel for the fear in my life
From across the great divide in the distance I saw light
John Baptist walking to me with the Maker

So my body has been turned broken
Through the long and dangerous sea
I can work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the maker

Oh Brother John Have you seen the homeless daughters
Standing there, with broken wings?
Well I have seen the flaming sword, there o'er East of Eden, 
burning in the eyes of the maker
burning in the eyes of the maker
burning in the eyes of the maker

oh river rise from your sleep
oh river rise from your sleep
oh river rise from your sleep---Lyrics submitted by Laurie.
