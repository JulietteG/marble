I remember thinkin'..
I'll go on forever only knowing I'll see you again
and I kmow the touch of you is hard to remember
but like that touch I know no other
and for sure we have danced in the risk of each other
would you like to dance around the world with me

I'll be falling all about my own things
and I know you're the heaviest weight here
when you're not here that's all around my head
and your lips burn wild
burn from the face of a child
and in your eyes a scene of the greatest viewing
do what you will, always walk where you like your steps
do as you please...I'll back you up

I remember thinkin'
sometimes we walk, sometime we run away
but I know no matter how fast we are running
somehow we keep....somehow we keep up with each other

I'll be falling all about my own things
and I know you're the heaviest weight here
when you're not here that's all around my head
and your lips burn wild
burn from the face of a child
and in your eyes a scene of the greatest veiwing
do what you will, always like where you walk your steps
do what you please.....
I'll back you up

I'll be falling all about my own things
and I know you're the heaviest weight here
when you're not here that's all around my head
and your lips burn wild 
burn fro the face of a child
and in your eyes a scene of the greatest veiwing
do what you will, always walk where you lie your steps
do as you please....
I'll back you up.---Lyrics submitted by stephanie.
