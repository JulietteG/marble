Come out Come out
No use in hiding
Come out Come out
Can you not see?
There's no place here,
What were you expecting?
Not room for both, 
Just room for me.

Say you will lay your arms down.
Yes I will call this home

Away away
You have been banished.
Your land is gone 
And given to me

And here I will spread my wings.
Yes I will call this home

What's this you say?
You feel the likes to remain and stay
I will bury you

What's this you say?
Your father's spirits still roam in this place
Well I will silence you

Here's the hitch 
Your horse is leaving

Don't miss your boat
It's leaving now

And as you go I will spread my wings
Yes I will call this home

I have no time to justify to you
Fool, you're blind
Move aside for me

All I can say 
To you my  new neighbor is
You must move on
Or i will bury you

Oh 
Now 
As I
Rest my feet by this fire
Those hands once warmed here
Well I have retired them
I can breathe my own air
And I can sleep more soundly
Upon these poor souls
I'll build heaven and call it HOME!!!!!!!!

Cuz you're all dead now
I live with my justice
I live with my greedy need
I live with no mercy
I live with my frenzied feeding
I live with my hatred
I live with my jealousy
And I live with the notion
That I don't need anyone but me

Don't drink the water
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water
Don't drink the water
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water
Don't drink the water..................---Lyrics submitted by Adrian.
