Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh

Praise God who has many names
The devil have many more
With the love that my mother gave me
I'm gonna drop the devil to the floor

I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees

There's always someone that will try to convince you
That they know the answer no matter the question
Be wary of those who believe in a neat little world
Cause its just fucking crazy you know that it is

Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana

Walking along in this haze of confusion
Sometimes I collect, sometimes it takes all of my strength
Just to find enough reason to take the next step, step
But I will, but I will, till I do

Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana

Brother, sister
Brother, sister
Brother, sister
Brother, sister

Praise God who has many names
The devil have many more
With the love that my mother gave me
I'm gonna drop the devil to the floor

I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees

Strange evolution how people have come to believe
That we are it's greatest achievement
When really we're just a collection of cells
Overrating themselves
Oh God I'm avoiding the truth 

Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana

Praise God who has many names
The devil have many more
With the love that my mother gave me
I'm gonna drop the devil to the floor
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees

Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana
Eh hee yeah amanaya yeaha yeah eh eh amana

Drop the devil to his knees
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
I'm gonna drop the devil to his knees
Brother, sister
Brother, sister
Praise God---Lyrics submitted by Danielle Lamber.
