Please find your place when the room grows scarce,
Once were all inside the service can begin.
For a moment if you please forget what you believe.
And naked you will see that we are all the same.

The power of your kiss, your words, your lips,
Your flesh, your bones, exactly what you need.
Your flesh, your bones, exactly what you need.

(Drum beats louder)
(Drum beats louder)

Why should I feel intrusion?
Why be afraid of what we do not understand?
To eliminate exclusion.
Cut out the differences, you feel like you belong.
Drum beats louder,
Drum beats louder,
Drum beats louder,
Drum beats louder.

Open up your head,
Open up you primitive.
Open up your mouth, and

Open up your head,
Youre sweet primitive,
Open up your mouth, its comin out.

Out there, no food or drink,
How many days do you think youd last on your diamonds and your pearls?
Im not a king, no, not a hero, not a fool,
Im not perfect, Im flesh and bones,
And Im exactly what you need.

Drum beats louder.
Drum beats louder.

Open up your head,
Open up you primitive,
Open up your mouth, and

Open up your head.
Youre sweet primitive,
Open up your mouth, its comin out.

Open up your head,
Scream, sweet primitive.
Tell me what you said.

But how your kiss, your words, your lips,
Not a gun to your head,
Youre gonna die before youre dead.

Not sad, when youre gone,
But when your lights still out,
Your dreams wont let you fly,
Dont be dead before you die.
Hunger, til fed, give love instead.
When it gets inside, watch the dead man squirm.

Above all things, if kindness is your king,
Then heaven will be yours before you meet your end

Open up your head
Open up you primitive
Open up your mouth, and

Open up your head,
Open up sweet primitive,
Open up your mouth, its comin out.

Open up your head
Open up you primitive
Open up your mouth, and

Open up your head,
Open up sweet primitive,
Open up your mouth, its comin out. ---Lyrics submitted by Louis Fallen.
