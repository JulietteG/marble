You get up every morning from your alarm clock's warning
Take the 8:15 into the city
There's a whistle up above and people pushin', people shovin'
And the girls who try to look pretty
And if your train's on time you can get to work by nine
And start your slaving job to get your pay
And if you ever get annoyed look at me I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I'll be
Taking care of business every day
Taking care of business every way
I've been taking care of business, it's all mine
Taking care of business and working overtime
Work out

If it were easy as fishin' you could be a musician
I if you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a second-hand guitar, chances are you'll go far
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows
People see you having fun just a-lying in the sun
Tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid and we're all self-employed
We love to work at nothing all day

And we'll be
Taking care of business every day
Taking care of business every way
I've been taking care of business, it's all mine
Taking care of business and working overtime

You get up every morning from your alarm clock's warning
Take the 8:15 into the city
There's a whistle up above and people pushin', people shovin'
And the girls who try to look pretty
And if your train's on time you can get to work by nine
And start your slaving job to get your pay
And if you ever get annoyed look at me I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I'll be
Taking care of business every day
Taking care of business every way
I've been taking care of business, it's all mine
Taking care of business and working overtime
Work out

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business, business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business---Lyrics submitted by John Frels.
