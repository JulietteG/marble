It's something 'bout you I cant explain
You give me love and take it away
I see you like this game that we play
And yo this fighting sh-t is getting too old
And you gon' find yourself left out in the cold
Its time to straighten up or you can move on on on on yeah

Yeah, something crazy about the way we love to hate each other
I don't wanna fight anymore
Every day we fighting like the navy baby
Maybe we could save each other
I don't wanna fight anymore
You go off, I go off
And you mad over nothing
I don't wanna fight anymore
Can't we just make love and not war

Baby theres something about you
You go that good shit I dont wanna give up
Its too good to give it away
Yeah Im feeling were just coming too close
Whos wrong or right this is outta control
Im not perfect but Im tired of this bullshit
Let's move on

Yeah, something crazy about the way we love to hate each other
I don't wanna fight anymore
Every day we fighting like the navy baby
Maybe we could save each other
I don't wanna fight anymore
You go off, I go off
And you mad over nothing
I don't wanna fight anymore
Can't we just make love and not war

White flag (ahhh), white flag (ahhh)
I'm waving a white flag, (ahh), white flag

Anymore, anymore, anymore
I don't wanna fight anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
And I don't wanna fight anymore

Yeah, something crazy about the way we love to hate each other
I don't wanna fight anymore
Every day we fighting like the navy baby
Maybe we could save each other
I don't wanna fight anymore
You go off, I go off
And you mad over nothing
I don't wanna fight anymore
Can't we just make love and not war

Yeah, something crazy about the way we love to hate each other
I don't wanna fight anymore
Every day we fighting like the navy baby
Maybe we could save each other
I don't wanna fight anymore
You go off, I go off
And you mad over nothing
I don't wanna fight anymore
Can't we just make love and not war---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
