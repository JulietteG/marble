I don't like the steps I took
To get to look
Into your deepest feelings

I don't like the place I'm in
Headspace within the hardwood and the ceiling

Cause if I'm restless
Then why do I
I want nothing but to rest my soul

And I don't get this and I know why
You see sometimes things are just beyond control

But I don't mind
But I'm not surprised to find that you do
I'm not surprised to find that you do
I know you do

And I feel fine
But I know the same does not apply to you
I know the same does not apply to you
So I guess that I'll curl up and die, too.

Clinging to the remnants of perfection
Like most do after they break it
Not knowing which directions the correct one
Do I discard or remake it

Cause if I don't know then I don't know
But I may know someone that knows me more than I
And if I somehow could rest this soul
Maybe control could find its way back to my life

But I don't mind
You see I know that I have done all this to you
To you

Yeah I'll curl up with you
Until I die with you [3x]
Yeah I'll curl up with you yeah my baby, yeah my darlin'
Until I die with you...---Lyrics submitted by elizabeth.
