Between the miles of open road
I lost sight of what might matter the most
I stumbled into the great unknown and found 
That time wont slow down

Im getting by with my collapsible lung
And its a good time 100% of the time
And Im like a ladder with a missing rung
And its a slow climb headed back to the sky
And Im feelin' backwards when Im trying the most
And I hope havent heard the last words from the holy ghost
Cause I think that Im supposed to be
Well on my way by now

I'll do the twist with my replaceable hips
And turn you right round 
Then dip you down to the ground
And now I wanna grow old and rub your tired limbs
And take it easy 
Until we wither away
Until we wither away

Between the miles of open road
I lost sight of what might matter the most
I stumbled into the great unknown and found 
That time cant slow down

To take a breath and then take it in
To think of places Ill go I havent been
To pour my heart into everything I've found 
Time wont slow down

Feelin' backwards
And I hope havent heard the last words
No, no, no
Cause I think that Im supposed to be
Well on my way-eh-eh!
Eh eh!
Wooo
To pour my heart into everything I found

Between the miles of open road
I lost sight of what might matter the most
I stumbled into the great unknown and found 
That time wont slow down

To take a breath and then take it in
To think of places Ill go I havent been---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
