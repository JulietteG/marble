Take it all down, Christmas is over
Do not despair, but rather be glad
We had a good year, now lets have another
Remembering all the good times that we had

Oh no more lights glistening
No more carols to sing
But Christmas, it makes way for Spring

The hearts of men, are bitter and weathered
As cold as the snow, that falls from above
But just for one day, we all came together
We showed the whole world that we know how to love

Oh no more lights glistening
No more carols to sing
But Christmas, it makes way for Spring

Oh no more lights glistening
No more carols to sing
But Christmas, it makes way for Spring

(Whistling)

Oh remember that Christmas
It makes way for Spring---Lyrics submitted by Ash.
