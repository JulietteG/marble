Leaving
May not be coming home
Needing
to know I'm not alone
Even
though I can't feel a thing

Taking
time to get over it
Making
the best of what won't quit
Breaking
down, I can't feel a thing

(Chorus)
Where do I go
Where do I stand
Where can I find myself again
Where do I go
If not disappear
Oh where do I go from here

Tracing
my steps right back to you
Racing
the clock to save an hour or two
Facing
the fact I don't feel a thing

Dealing
with what I can't control
Feeling
confused 'cause I don't know
if healing
is when I don't feel a thing

(Chorus)
Where do I go
Where do I stand
Where can I find myself again
Where do I go
If not disappear
Oh where do I go from

Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
And I still can't feel a thing---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
