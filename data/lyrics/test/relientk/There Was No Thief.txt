For a time I thought there was a thief among us
I thought Id track him down but prior to my pursuit
The smoke cleared into my disbelief
There was no thief cuz it was me that lost you
There was no thief cuz it was me that lost you

I guess its safe to say youre never coming back
And I understand why you wouldnt want to 
I guess its up to me to find a way to get to you

And theres just one last thing that I have to say
As we reflect on the mess of all this Ive made
It was cowardice that made me push you away
I was so afraid cuz you were so much better than me

I cant see you getting used to 
Living in the midst of your perfection
And Im so lost how you can trust
Somewhere the sun is always shinin, oh

And theres just one last thing that I have to say
As we reflect on the mess of all this Ive made
It was cowardice that made me push you away
I was so afraid cuz you were so much better than me

I guess its safe to say youre never coming back.---Lyrics submitted by joslyn.
