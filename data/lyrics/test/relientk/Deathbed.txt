I can smell the
Death on the sheets
Covering me 
I can't believe
This is the end...

But this is my deathbed
Lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight
I know I'll be home...

The year was 1941.
I was eight years old
And far, far to young
To know that the stories
Of battles and glory
Was a tale a kind mother
Made up for her son, you see
Dad was a traveling preacher
Teachin the words of a teacher
And Mother had sworn he went off to the war
And died there with honor
Somewhere on a beach there
But he left once to never return
Which taught me that I should unlearn
Whatever I thought a father should be. 
I abandoned that thought
Like he abandoned me.

Bout '47, I was fourteen
I'd acquired a taste for liquer and nicoteen
I smoked until I threw up, yet
I still lit 'em up for 30 more years 
Like a machine
So right there you have it
That one filthy habit
Is what got me where I am today...

I can smell the
Death on the sheets
Covering me 
I can't believe
This is the end...

I can hear those
Sad memories
Still haunting me
So many things
I'd do again...

But this is my deathbed
I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight
I know I'll be home...

Got married on my 21st
Eight months before
My wife would give birth
Its easier to be sure you love someone
When her father inquires
With the barrel of a gun
The union was far from harmonious
No two people could've been
More alone then us
The years would go by
And she'd love someone else
And I realized I hadn't
Been loved yet myself

From there it's your typical shpeal
Yeah, if life was a highway
I was drunk at the wheel
I was watching the loose ends
All fell apart
Yeah, I swear I was destined to fail 
And fail from the start
I bowled about six times a week
A bottle of beam 
Kept the memories from me
A marriage I'd taken
A seven-ten split
And along with my pride
The ex-wife took the kids

I can smell the
Death on the sheets
Covering me 
I can't believe
This is the end...

I can hear those
Sad memories
Still haunting me
So many things
I'd do again...

But this is my deathbed
I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight
I know I'll be home...

I was so scared of Jesus
But he sought me out
Like the cancer in my lungs
Is killing me now
And I've givin up hope 
On the days I have left
But I cling to the hope
Of my life in the next

Then Jesus showed up
Said, "Before we go
I thought that we might reminisce...
See one night in your life
When you'd turned out the lights
You asked for and prayed for my forgiveness.

"You cried wolf.
The tears, they soaked your fur
The blood dripped from your fangs
You said, 'What have I done?'
You love that lamb, with every sinful bone
And there, you wept alone
Your heart was still contrite.

"You said,
'Jesus, please forgive me of my crimes
Sanctify this withered heart of mine
Stay with me until my life is through
And on that day, please take me home with you,' "

I can smell the
Death on the sheets
Covering me 
I can't believe
This is the end...

I can hear you
Whisper to me,
"It's time to leave
You'll never be lonely again."

But this was my deathbed
Died there alone
When I closed my eyes tonight
You carried me home...

(Instrumental Break)

"I am the way
Follow me
And take my hand

"And I am the turth
Embrace me
And you'll understand

"And I am the life 
And for me
You'll live again

"For I am love
I am love
I am 
I am
Love."---Lyrics submitted by David Wampler.
