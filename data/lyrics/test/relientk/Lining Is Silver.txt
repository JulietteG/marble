I found my new black shoes, while cleaning out the bones left in my closet, they were there with a bad excuse. 
And I found a back up plan, I'm grateful that I didn't have to use it, but it's made up of real good friends. 

Isn't nice to know, that the lining is silver. 
Isn't nice to know, that we're golden. 

Well I found a list of flaws, that I saw in myself and other people, and I threw it away because... 

Isn't nice to know, that the lining is silver. 
Isn't nice to know, that we're golden. Oh! 

Isn't nice to know, that the lining is silver. 
Isn't nice to know, that we're golden. Yeah we're golden, Whoa. 

When it all falls apart, and you can't see the forest for the symmetries.Oh, Oh, Oh! 

Isn't nice to, Isn't nice to know. 
Oh, Isn't nice to, Isn't nice to know. 

Isn't nice to know, that the lining is silver. 
Isn't nice to know, that we're golden. Oh! 

Isn't nice to know, that the lining is silver. 
Isn't nice to know, that we're golden. Yeah we're golden, Whoa. 

I found a love in me. I always somehow knew that it exsisted, it just needed to be set free. 

Isn't nice to know, 
Isn't nice to know, 
Isn't nice to know.---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
