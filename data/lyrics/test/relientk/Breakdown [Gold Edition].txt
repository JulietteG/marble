Oh what a lousy excuse for a car
One mile to go but I can't push it that far
I think I've had enough 
I think I'm, 
I'm giving up

Saved up my money to but a new guitar
Then I got ripped off by the guy who fixed my car
I think I've had enough 
I think I'm, 
I'm giving up

Once again life's thrown me a curve
And it blew up right in my face
Once again life's rattled my nerves
Can't you see that I'm stuck in this place [x2]

All because 
You're giving me a 

Breakdown (breakdown)
Breakdown, oh [x8]

Stuck on the side of the road
Emotion overload [x2]

Yes He can destroy 
Everything that I enjoy
But I won't be the one He takes down
No I won't breakdown

You're giving me a

Breakdown (breakdown)
Breakdown, oh [x8]

Break it down break it down break it down break it down
Breakdown oh [x4]---Lyrics submitted by sydney.
