i think you know what im gettin at,
i fine it so up[settin that,
the memories that used to let,
they keep the bad but the good youll just forget.

and even though im angry i still can say
i know my heart will break the day
when you peel out and travel away 

i cant believe this happened
and all this time i never thought
that all we had, would be all for none.

CHORUS:
no i dont hate you,
dont wanna fight you.
know ill always love you 
but right now i just dont like you.
no i dont hate you,
dont wanna fight you.
know ill always love you 
but right now i just dont like you
cause oyu took this too far. too far.

its your decision dont you dare think twice, 
go with your instincts along with some bad advice.
this didnt turn out the way i thought it would at all.
you blame me,
but some of it is still your fault.

i tried to move you,
but you just wouldnt budge,
i tried to hold your hand 
but youd rather hold your grudge.

i think you know what im getting at.
you say goodbye and i just dont want to regret it and...

CHORUS:
no i dont hate you
dont wanna fight you
know ill always love you but irght now i just dont like you
(repeat)

waste of always choosings 
these black eyes and these bruises.
over the heartache that they say,
never completely goes away.
