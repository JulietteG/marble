As you push it up through the soil I will shake your filthy hand.
You may be dead to me but that don't mean we can't be friends.
Now it's time to get over this as long as it's clear you understand
that I will never trust a single thing you say again.

Chorus:
Because the judge of you is someone I could never be,
Is why you should thank the Lord that it is him, and it's not me.
But don't give up it's not the end 
there's hope for every fallen man.
To pick themselves up when they think they can't
Because with every passing second comes a second chance oh oh oh

You stole so much from me and there is nothing left to take.
Save a hard learned lesson on how to not make the same mistake.
And you may be delirious but that is something that will fade.
After you confess that this mess is all something that you made.

Chorus: 
Oh because the judge of you is someone I could never be
Is why you should thank the Lord that it is him, and it's not me.
But don't give up it's not the end 
there's hope for every fallen man.
To pick themselves up when they think they can't
Because with every passing second comes a second chance oh oh oh

Don't give up it's not the end.
You'll get back on your feet again.
Forgiveness can be given when you think it can't.
Because with every passing second there's a second chance 

oh oh oh oh oh

Take a good look at yourself and know,
You've got yourself a ways to go.
But difficult is not impossible.
You can take back all the lost control.

Take a good look at yourself and see,
That you'll emerge eventually.
As long as your heart's not too far gone
from the only thing that can save you from 
Yourself.

Forgiveness can be given when you think it can't
'Cause with every passing second comes a second chance---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
