So it was Jeremy in 1983 
In his Ocean Pacific tee
He got a bloody knee, 
On his skateboard in the half-pipe,
In the backyard, that Tuesday night.

And Im only gonna pierce my left ear,
And Ive been working on this moustache all summer long 
And my favorite band will always be Tears for Fears,
And Im gonna wear pink tux to the prom

Cutting class through the first floor window,
Is kinda fast, cause you never did a thing so,
And I look up to my big bro
Cause in the 80s all the ladies held his hand and couldnt let go.

And Im only gonna pierce my left ear,
And Ive been working on this moustache all summer long 
And my favorite band will always be Tears for Fears,
And Im gonna wear pink tux to the prom
A pink tux, to the prom

(doo do doo do doo pink tux to the prom doo do doo do doo pink tux to the prom)

I am gonna wear, a pink tux to the prom
(Live without a care)
What could possibly go wrong?

When youre the president, of the breakfast club
And youre not hesitant, to fall in love 
To fall in love
To throw it away 
To fall in love
With the 80s

I am gonna wear, a pink tux to the prom
(Live without a care)
What could possibly go wrong?
I am gonna wear, a pink tux to the prom
(Live without a care)
Cause you threw it away
To fall in love
With the 80s

(doo do doo do doo, doo do doo do doo, doo do doo do doo)---Lyrics submitted by Rebekah.
