(Whistling)

If it hurts, kiss it better
You wear skirts I write nice letters
Never sent nothing but flowers 
Though we always talked for hours

And I know it gets much colder 
When I cry on my own shoulder
But we know the show will go on
Guess I know I guess I'll throw on

Some Jefferson Aeroplane
 I'm trapped and I am enclosed
But I won't complain
 I'll open all the windows
Jefferson Aeroplane 
I'm trapped and I am enclosed
Cause when it's colder 
I feel much better 
When I cry on my own shoulder
Just throw on a sweater and go
And I'll go
To where the weather's nice and warm
And I'll go
To where I am reborn
And I'll go
Cause in my dreams I can't complain
And I'll go
In my Jefferson Aeroplane

You make the calls 
I cover my ears
Niagra Falls still falls on New Years
I will save your plunging neckline
Kiss your face you try to deck mine
If I behave It's gonna cost him
Skip the rave in downtown Boston
We all know the show will go on 
Guess I know I guess I'll throw on

Some Jefferson Aeroplane
 I'm trapped and I am enclosed
But I won't complain
 I'll open all the windows
Jefferson Aeroplane
 I'm trapped and I am enclosed
But I won't complain
 I'll open all the windows
Cause when it's colder 
I feel much better
When I cry on my own shoulder 
Just throw on a sweater and go 
And I'll go to where the weather is nice and warm 
And I'll go to where sicne I am reborn 
And I'll go cause in my dreams I can't complain 
And I'll fly on my Jefferson Airplane 

My Jefferson Airplane
 I'm trapped and I am enclosed 
But I won't complain
 I'll open all the windows 
Jefferson Airplane
 I'm trapped and I am enclosed 
But I won't complain 
I'll open all the windows 
Cause when it's colder 
I feel much better 
when I cry on my own shoulder 
Just throw on a sweater and go---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
