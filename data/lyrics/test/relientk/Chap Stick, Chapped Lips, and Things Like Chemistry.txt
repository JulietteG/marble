ok so
who doesnt have a cell phone
who brought back their permission slip
because i know nobody wants to stay home 
while the rest of us go out and make a day of it

cause theme parks are so much fun when the sun's outside
na na na na na
and i lost my phone to the lake beneath the batman ride
na na na na

they're starting something and i dont wanna be in it
theyre looking for trouble but with me it wont be found

and i regret that im completely out of daytime minuets
so i guess ill have to wait alot till 8 o'clock comes around

ok so 
who doesnt own a cell phone
well i dont need to ask my friends because i know
mine was fastened to my jawbone
thanks to all those nights and weekends

and theme parks are so much more fun when the sun's outside
na na na na na
and i lost my phone to the lake beneath the batman ride
na na na na

theyre starting something and i dont want to be in it
theyre looking for trouble but with me it wont be found

and i regret that im completely out of daytime minuets
so i guess ill have to wait alot till 8 o'clock comes around

when it comes to relationships 
im the dumbest one
and i dont mean just with girls 
i mean with everyone

your illustrations always point out just whats wrong with me
its chap stick and chapped lips and things like chemistry

its chap stick and chapped lips and things like 
its chap stick and chapped lips and things like
its chap stick and chapped lips and things like
chemistry

can i relate to you the way you relate to me
can you help me out with my chemistry
i dont want to be perceived the way i am
i just want to be percieved the way i am---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
