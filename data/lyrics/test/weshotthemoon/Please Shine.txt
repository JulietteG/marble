Fly away on a plane
Just like you came to me
Take a bow, you take a bow
Your spirits left with me

Watch the clouds making shapes
And picture me with you
I'm so alive, I'm so alive
You color up my world

Halleluiah was all that I could sing
Halleluiah

You shine, I shine.
My dear, my life
Is washed up like a seashell longing to be dry
So please shine, please shine.

Reverie, your reverie is full of all of me
Walk around my town all day
We pretend to run away

Halleluiah was all that I could sing
Halleluiah

You shine, I shine.
My dear, my life
Is washed up like a seashell longing to be dry
So please shine, please shine so bright.

You're over there and I was nowhere near.

You shine, I shine.
My dear, my life
Is washed up like a seashell longing to be dry
So please shine, please shine.

If you shine, I shine.
My dear, my life
Is washed up like a seashell longing to be dry
So please shine, please shine---Lyrics submitted by Dominique.
