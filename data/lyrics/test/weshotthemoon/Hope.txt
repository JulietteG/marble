Hope, it's all that I have
The calm in the storm, it's right where I am
Inside of hope, it's all that I know
It's what I move toward, 
It's what I live for

Wave goodbye, to a time
That you once believed was everything

I'm ready to live
I'm ready to dream
I'm ready for fear and love and everything in between
Don't tell me I'm right
Don't tell me I'm wrong
Just tell me your strong enough for one more song
And this could be the one to say it right
Bringing warmth into the night
Im going to broke, but Ive got hope

The sound its all around
And we can be found
All in good time.
Im forgiving yesterday
Wishing yesterday would forgive me, but Ill never see

So wave goodbye to a time
That you once believed was everything

Im ready to live
Im ready to dream
Im ready for fear, love and everything between

Dont tell me Im right
Dont tell me Im wrong
Just tell me Im strong enough for one more song
And this could be the one to say it right
Bringing warmth into the night
Im going to broke, but Ive got hope

Im ready to live, I live for hope.
Im ready to live, I live for hope.

Im ready to live
Im ready to dream
Im ready for fear, love and everything between

Dont tell me Im right
Dont tell me Im wrong
Just tell me Im strong enough for one more song
And this could be the one to say it right
Bringing warmth into the night
Im going to broke, but Ive got hope
Yeah, Ive got hope.---Lyrics submitted by Martyna.
