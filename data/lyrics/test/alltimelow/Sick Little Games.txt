Oh my god, I'm such a terrible mess
I'm turned on by the tabloids
You would never have guessed
That I'm a sucker for the gossip, man I take it too far
I bottle up my Hollywood 
And watch them name their kids after cars

I'm finding me out
I'm having my doubts
I'm losing the best of me

We're all part of the same sick little games
And I need to get-away (get-away)
I'm wasting the days, I throw them away
Losing it all on these sick little games

Fell in love
She was the friend of the sister
Of somebody famous - at least for a day

Expensive habits and a taste for the town
Had me chasing down red carpets
And watching all my friends slip away

They're finding me out
I'm having my doubts
I'm losing the best of me
Dressed up as myself
To live in the shadow of who I'm supposed to be

We're all part of the same sick little games
And I need to get-away (get-away)
I'm wasting the days, I throw them away
Losing it all on these sick little games

If I play my cards right
I can make the big time
I could be a reason to stare

Caught up in the spotlight
Shaking from the stage fright
How did I end up here?

All part of the same sick little games
And I need to get-away (get-away, get-away...)

We're all part of the same sick little games
And I need to get-away (get-away)
I'm wasting the days, I throw them away
Losing it all on these sick little games

(All part of the same sick little games)
And I need to get-away (get-away, get-away)---
