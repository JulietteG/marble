I wish you could see your face right now
'Cause you're grinning like a fool.
And we're sitting on your kitchen floor
On a Tuesday afternoon.

It dosent matter when we get back
To doing what we do.
'Cause right now could last forever
Just as long as I'm with you.

You're just a daydream away
I wouldn't know what to say if I had you.
And I'll keep you a day dream away.
Just watch from a safe place
So I'll never have to lose.

We would go out on the weekend
To escape our busy lives.
We would laugh at all the douche bag guys
Chasing down the despret wives.

And I would drink a little too much
You'd offer me a ride.
I'd offer you a t-shirt
You'd stay another night.

You're just a daydream away
I wouldn't know what to say if I had you.
And I'll keep you a day dream away.
Just watch from a safe place
So I'll never have to lose.

We never stood a chance out there
Shooting love in real time.
So I'll take it over ice tonight
With a little salt
And a little lime.

You're just a daydream away
I wouldn't know what to say if I had you.
And I'll keep you a day dream away.
Just watch from a safe place
So I'll never have to lose.

You're just a daydream away
I wouldn't know what to say if I had you.---Lyrics submitted by Jackalecian.
