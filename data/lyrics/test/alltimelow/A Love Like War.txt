Make a wish on our sorry little hearts,
have a smoke, pour a drink, steal a kiss in the dark,
fingernails on my skin like the teeth of a shark,
I'm intoxicated by the lie...
In the chill of your stare I am painfully lost,
like a deer in the lights of an oncoming bus,
For the thrill of your touch, I will shamefully lust,
as you tell me we're nothing but trouble...

Heart's on fire tonight,
Feel my bones ignite,
Feels like war, (x2)

We go together or we don't go down at all, (x3)

Fail-safe trigger, lock-down call,
Wipe the drive, clean-slate, quick, sound the alarm!
No escape from the truth and the weight of it all,
I am caught in the web of a lie...
and the bitch of it all is that I'm running from,
the desire of the people to whom I belong,
at the end of the day you can tell me I'm wrong,
'cause you went to all the trouble...

Heart's on fire tonight,
Feel my bones ignite,
Feels like war, (x2)

We go together or we don't go down at all, (x3)

Heart's on fire tonight,
Feel my bones ignite,
It feels like war...
Love feels like war. (x2)

We go together or we don't go down at all, (x3)

Is this the end of us, or just a means to start again?---
