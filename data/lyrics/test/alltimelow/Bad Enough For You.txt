No, I wont call you baby
I wont buy you daisies
Cuz that dont work
And I know, how to get you crazy
How to make you want me
So bad it hurts

I wanna be good, good, good to you
But thats not, not, not your type
So Im gonna be bad for you
Tonight, tonight, tonight

I'll misbehave if it turns you on
No Mr. Right if you want Mr. Wrong
I'll tell you lies
If you don't like the truth
I don't wanna be bad
I just wanna be bad enough for you
Well, I just wanna be bad enough for you
Well, I just wanna be bad enough

Hey, thanks for the number
I'm not gonna call you
'Cause that won't work
You like to play hide-and-go-get-her
You like me better when I play the jerk

I wanna be good, good, good to you
But thats not, not, not your type
So Im gonna be bad for you
Tonight, tonight, tonight

I'll misbehave if it turns you on
No Mr. Right if you want Mr. Wrong
I'll tell you lies
If you don't like the truth
I don't wanna be bad
I just wanna be bad enough for you
Well, I just wanna be bad enough for you
Well, I just wanna be bad enough

You love to hate me when Im chasing you
And I hate to say this but Im stuck on loving you
So I pretend that I dont care
Ill stand you up to keep you here
Ill make you hate me just enough to make you want me
I'll misbehave if it turns you on
No Mr. Right if you want Mr. Wrong
I'll tell you lies
If you don't like the truth
I don't wanna be bad
I just wanna be bad enough for you
Well, I just wanna be bad enough for you
Well, I just wanna be bad enough---Lyrics submitted by Gerald Edward.
