Falling on my face again
So I know I'm right on track
It's hard for me to make amends
When you stab me in the back
Sail it on to another sorry shore
Talking shit, say I'm your filthy little, filthy little
Like I just happen to be in the right place right time
Just settle down

I earned my place with the tidal waves
I can't escape this feeling that something ain't right
I called my name as I crashed the gates
Still I can't escape this feeling that something ain't right
Why don't you think before you speak?
Cause you don't know me at all
You don't know me at all

Tell me how you really feel
Write it on the bathroom wall
If anyone was watching
I know you'd say nothing at all
Treading water, yeah, you're angry and you're bored
But I'm sick of this, I'm just your filthy little, filthy little
Like I just happen to be at the right place right time
Oh, would you settle down?

I earned my place with the tidal waves
I can't escape this feeling that something ain't right
I called my name as I crashed the gates
Still I can't escape this feeling that something ain't right
Why don't you think before you speak?
Cause you don't know me at all

Spread your lies like fireflies
In a wild hot summer trying to pull me under
You sharpen words to use like knives
When you lose your colour, there'll be nothing left

I earned my place with the tidal waves
I can't escape this feeling that something ain't right
I called my name as I crashed the gates
Still I can't escape this feeling that something ain't right
Why don't you think before you speak?
Cause you don't know me at all
You don't know me at all
You don't know me at all
You don't know me at all
You don't know me at all---
