When you gonna give it up?
You're giving me such a rush
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on? [x2]

You are the taste of something sweet
And I'm tangled in the sheets
You left a mark, dragged down my back
So chain me up, I'm in too deep
Too much of you is never enough

When you gonna give it up?
You're giving me such a rush
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?
Just another pretty face
But I want one more taste
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?

Just one fix
To keep me in the mix
And I'm still strung out on you
Drove all night
I'm a deer in your headlights
What's left of me you'll swallow soon
Too much of you is never enough

So when you gonna give it up?
You're giving me such a rush
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?
Just another pretty face
But I want one more taste
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?

You took what you wanted
You got it
You know it 
I'm haunted by everything that you gave me
You made me, you broke me, you saved me
I'm crazy, but I'm not done

So when you gonna give it up?
You're giving me such a rush
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?
(Holly, would you turn me on?)
Just another pretty face
But I want one more taste
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?

When you gonna give it up?
You're giving me such a rush
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?
Just another pretty face
But I want one more taste
Come on, Holly
Would you turn me on?---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
