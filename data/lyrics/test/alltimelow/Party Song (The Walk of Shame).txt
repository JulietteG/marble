I took a walk for the very first time on the dark side of the dancefloor
I lit a match just to heat things up, but I got more than I bargained for
Mixed drinks, mixed feelings of elation
I should have known it was a one night invitation

Don't sweat it, forget it
Everything is a-ok
Just let it, go then its, off to find another face
I make you come just to watch you leave
You walk around with my heart on your sleeve
Don't sweat it, it's over now
Our time ran out

I took an oath but I'm givin' it up
You didn't have to see things my way
Nothing more than a casual fuck
Isn't that just how we operate?
Let's drink to feelings of temptation
You and I, we're an overnight sensation

Don't sweat it, forget it
Everything is a-ok
Just let it, go then its, off to find another face
I make you come just to watch you leave
I walk around with your heart on my sleeve
Don't sweat it, it's over now
Our time ran out

Outside the brake lights started to dim
I felt the tension that's been pullin' us in
And then we do it again
So we can feel all right, fallin' in love for the night

Don't sweat it, forget it
Everything is a-ok
Just let it, go then its, off to find another face
I make you come just to watch you leave
You walk around with my heart on your sleeve
Don't sweat it, it's over now
Our time ran out

Our time ran out
Our time ran out
Our time ran out
Our time ran out---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
