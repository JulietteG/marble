My ship went down
In a sea of sound
When I woke up alone
I had everything

A handful of moments
I wished I could change
And a tongue like a nightmare
That cut like a blade

In a city of fools
I was careful and cool
But they tore me apart
Like a hurricane

A handful of moments
I wished I could change
But I was carried away

Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everthing
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can keep all your misery

My lungs gave out
As I faced the crowd
I think that keeping this up
Could be dangerous

I'm flesh and bone
I'm a rolling stone
And the experts say I'm delirious

Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everthing
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can take back your misery

Arrogant boy
Love yourself so no one has to
They're better off without you
(They're better off without you)
Arrogant boy
Cause a scene like you're supposed to
They'll fall asleep without you
You're lucky if your memory remains

Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everthing
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can take back your misery

Therapy, I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everthing
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
You can choke on your misery---Lyrics submitted by Sophie.
