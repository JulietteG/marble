show us off to all your friends
we're the trophy boys from here to if and when
we break and break your dreams of
keeping us a secret
we're the back pocket believers
we're the locals who went postal
call it treason while you can
i'm just a face for every picture
a smile for your scap books
and a story to be told and told
but i'm loving every second
so commemorate this hour 
as the last i spend regretting what i have
boys raise your glasses
girls shake those-(get up,get up!)
we're the party
you're the people
let's make this night a classic
we play, you move (come on, let me hear you!)
we're the party, you're the people
and this is how we, this is how we do
the curtain's rising 
i'm forgetting where i've been
i watch the lights go up on a star without his screen
set it off and sing it back
directions keeping me on track
but i'll admit, i do it all for the attention
im just a face for every picture
a smile for your scrap books
and a story to be told and told
but i'm loving every second
so commemorate this hour
as the last i spend regretting what i have
boys raise your glasses
girls shake those-(get up,get up!)
we're the party you're the people
let's make this night a classic
we play, you move (come on, let me hear you!)
we're the party, you're the people
and this is how we, this is how we do---Lyrics submitted by shanae'.
