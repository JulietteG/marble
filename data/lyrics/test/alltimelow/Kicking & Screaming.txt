Say hello to all my little nightmares
They're right here
I know them well

History repeats itself in phrases
Scribbled in dark places
Like notches on a belt
(They're chasing after you, bro)

I'm chasing after rock and roll
Kicking and screaming

I've been waiting for you to call
And dress me up
My sucker love
Drag me 'round
Kicking and screaming

So long and thanks for all
The make-believe
The memories
Of you and me
Kicking and screaming

Say goodbye to all the pretty faces
Dark places
I know too well

Fantasy competes to be my only
I'm fucking lonely
Like bottles on the shelf
(There's one more chasing for you)

I'm chasing after rock and roll
Kicking and screaming

I've been waiting for you to call
And dress me up
My sucker love
Drag me 'round
Kicking and screaming

So long and thanks for all
The make-believe
The memories
Of you and me
Kicking and screaming

Say hello to all my little nightmares
They're right here, I know them well

I've been waiting for you to call
And dress me up
My sucker love
Drag me 'round
Kicking and screaming

So long and thanks for all
(Thanks for all)
The make-believe
The memories
Of you and me
Kicking and screaming
Kicking and screaming
Kicking and screaming---
