Im an all night worker
And it fits me to a T
Im an all night worker
And it fits me to a T
And if you need some lovin
Baby, why dont you call on me

Im an all night worker
Baby, you are just my speed
Im an all night worker
Baby, you are just my speed
And if your man dont have it
I got everything you need

Call me four oclock in the morning
I liked it better like that
Satisfaction guaranteed or you get your money back!
Im an all night worker
And it fits me to a T
And if you need some lovin
Baby, why dont you call on me---Lyrics submitted by Elias James.
