Saw you out by pool on the eighth of July
Didn't think much about it at the time
Didn't know that I'd have to cross this line
Didn't know, didn't know
I remember the guy who lost his pants
Took a hit then you laughed and then we danced
Now Im around you and I don't trust my hands
Help me out, help me out

Now that were cool, we can just chill, we can be friends
The problem with thats Ive gotten in over my head

I cant think about anybody but you, sugar
I cant think about anybody but you
I cant think about anybody but you, sugar
I cant think about anybody but you

Take your time work it out with a bottle of wine
Give a word, give a wink, or give a sign
Let me know it before I lose my mind
Let me know, let me know
How far do you think that this could go
Would you sign your name with an x or an o?
We could rush in or we could go slow

You know what?
I used to be the type like watch and learn
But you can teach me how the tables turn
Got an old pro feeling like an amateur
Making it up as I do it entrepreneur
If I say the right things will you come to me?
If I play the right strings can I slay the piece? Youre the one that I want I gotta do something
Got me feeling right like ooo yummy
The hustle, bustle, sitting on the cusp of crisis
Your midas touch is full of diamonds
Can we survive with a fate like the Mayans?
How can I live when the way I feel about you is Intentional, dimensional?
Flirtation is inevitable
Chemical, edible, side effects regrettable
My best judgment fights with the liquor
Is that a spark in your eyes or a flicker? ---
