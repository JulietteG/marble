I'm just a prisoner of Love
You got me lip locked by used gum
Ohohohh
If I escaped too I would be lost
Just don't bail me out babe I'll pay cost
Ohohohh

Aw See it ain't that funny spent my money
Sweet as a felon
Ain't you hunny
I can here the gripes
But Im werin stripes
Look up at the stars
But I gotta think twice

Ohohhoh

All of the fighting

Ohohhoh

Keeps it excitin
I'm doin' time but I dont mind
Ill be just fine
Sometime I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I dont mind
Ill be just fine
Sometime I just hate to love you
Ohoh uh oh
Ohoh uh oh
Ohoh uh oh
OHHHHHHHH
I'm doin' time
It's a real fight
But its all right
Sometime I just hate to love you

You got me up a treating me cold
I though the key out a long time ago
Ohohohh
If you release me I wouldnt leave
No
So don't feed me poison I gotta eat
Ohohohh

OHH
Me and my cell mate
Are planing our escape
Tell me when your ready
And we can storm the front gate
Who are the jail people
Real deep sleeper
No big deal just misdemeanor

Ohohohh

All of the fighting

Ohohohh

Keeps it excitin

I'm doin' time but I dont mind
Ill be just fine
Sometime I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I dont mind
Ill be just fine
Sometime I just hate to love you
Ohoh uh oh
Ohoh uh oh
Ohoh uh oh
OHHHHHHHH
I'm doin' time
It's a real fight
But it's all right
Sometime I just hate to love you
See I dont need the bars to lock me in
You can let your guard down till the end
Forever doesnt have to know for night
And thats why
I'm doin' time but I dont mind
Ill be just fine
I'm doin' time but I dont mind
Ill be just fine
Sometime I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I dont mind
Ill be just fine
Sometime I just hate to love you
I'm doin' time but I dont mind
Ill be just fine
Sometime I just hate to love you
Ohoh uh oh
Ohoh uh oh
Ohoh uh oh
OHHHHHHHH
I'm doin' time
It's a real fight
But its all right
Sometime I just hate to love you ---
