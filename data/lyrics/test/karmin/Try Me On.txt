If you wanna try me on
Don't think we're together
I change like the weather
If you wanna try me on
I wouldn't admit it
Even if we fitted
Oh you got my attention
If you wanna try me on
Stop the conversating
Don't you keep me waiting

I admit it, you did it
You got me feelin' something kind of vicious, delicious
But boy I promise I won't do your dishes
Honey write that down, now take a picture
You see me now, independent bitch

I be comin' at you like a ragin' bull
You better be gunnin' with a cannon full
I don't wanna hear you say a thing at all
Unless you're sayin' baby do you want some more

Hold up girl I like the way you talk
We can do it like you want
We can do it like you want

If you wanna try me on
Don't think we're together
I change like the weather
If you wanna try me on
I wouldn't admit it
Even if we fitted
Oh you got my attention
If you wanna try me on
Stop the conversating
Don't you keep me waiting

I'm the sickest, malicious
I tear you up in pieces make you wishes, you didn't
Fall so deep in love the very second
That I let you taste my sugar coated waste
You gonna be sayin' hey, I want some cavities

I be comin' at you like a ragin' bull
You better be gunnin' with a cannon full
I don't wanna hear you say a thing at all
Unless you're sayin' baby do you want some more

Hold up girl I like the way you talk
We can do it like you want
We can do it like you want

If you wanna try me on
Don't think we're together
I change like the weather
If you wanna try me on
I wouldn't admit it
Even if we fitted
Oh you got my attention
If you wanna try me on
Stop the conversating
Don't you keep me waiting

If you want to try me on, you better be careful baby
If you get too carried on, you could fall in love [x2]

If you wanna try me on
Don't think we're together
I change like the weather
If you wanna try me on
I wouldn't admit it
Even if we fitted
Oh you got my attention
If you wanna try me on
Stop the conversating
Don't you keep me waiting ---
