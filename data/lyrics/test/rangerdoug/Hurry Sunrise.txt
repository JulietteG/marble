Hurry sunrise
Ive been waiting all night
Endless hours have passed as I lie here and wait for the light

Hurry sunrise
Ive done all I can do
To forget her sweet song as I wait for the dawn to break through

Im all right through the day
Cause Im busy with cattle to tend
But the nights are so long
With a heart I dont know how to mend

The moon and the stars sail silently on through the sky
While my hardened heart and its sorrow keeps whispering by

Hurry sunrise
Whats taking so long?
Every minutes an hour reliving the moments weve known

Each memorys a crystalline treasure of true love and trust
All come down to this: endless nights and ashes and dust

Im all right through the day
Cause Im busy with cattle to tend
But the nights are so long
With a heart I dont know how to mend

The moon and the stars sail silently on through the sky
While my hardened heart and its sorrow keeps whispering by

Hurry sunrise
Whats taking so long?
Every minutes an hour reliving the moments weve known

Each memorys a crystalline treasure of true love and trust
All come down to this: endless nights and ashes and dust---Lyrics submitted by James C.
