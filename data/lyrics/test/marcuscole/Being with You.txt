Being with You, being with You, being with You
I love being with You, with You I can let my guard down
With You I can pour my heart out, with You life is so secure now
I love being with You

In the solitude of quietness
And in my pursuit to find myself
I'm aware of just how blessed
I am to commune with You

Now in my life there's a lot of time spent
With cute clichs and speaking eloquent
But in my heart is the true sentiment
So let me be true

Being with You, being with You, being with You
I love being with You, with You I can let my guard down
With You I can pour my heart out, with You life is so secure now
I love being with You

Now I shouldn't have to pretend like I'm something I'm not
And I don't want to floss like I got a lot 'cause I don't
There are things in my past that I'm glad You forgot
And that I tell you, thank You

I think it was Andre that said if I had ten thousand tongues
I would tell the world but that wouldn't be enough
So I'll be content with an audience of one
Thank You for spending time with Your son

Being with You, being with You, being with You
I love being with You, with You I can let my guard down
With You I can pour my heart out, with You life is so secure now
I love being with You

Sometimes I feel like I don't want to sing Your song
'Cause I am far from perfect and I don't want to lead anybody wrong
But You above all people know my heart and You know where I stand
So I'm going to stay right here till I become a better man

Being with You, being with You, being with You
I love being with You, with You I can let my guard down
With You I can pour my heart out, with You life is so secure now
I love being with You

With You I can let my guard down
With You I can pour my heart out
With You life is so secure now
I love being with You---Lyrics submitted by walter williams.
