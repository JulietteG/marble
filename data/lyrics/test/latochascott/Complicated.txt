eh girl, eh girl, eh girl, eh girl

I made you my first
you made me your last
I tried to make it work 
but now my love is in your past
oh I don't know if I can make another space in my heart
everything right turned wrong
everything good turned bad

It's so hard for me to figure out the man inside of you
and you try to make a sound like aint giving something that I should
I'm not gonna even stress it out
I'd rather do without
I'm done

But when I'm half way up out the door
tell me why I keep fallin for you
falling for you, falling for you
falling for you, falling for you
how do I keep loving you 
loving you, loving you
loving you, loving you 
why you gotta be complicated, complicated
so complicated, complicated, complicated
whoaa whoaa

Got me in my feelings 
like I did you wrong
how you do the dirt but then don't pick up to call
I been tryna separate myself from the people in my life
that don't mean 
me no good and that's including you

It's so hard for me to figure out the man inside of you
and you try to make a sound like aint giving something that I should
I'm not gonna even stress it out
I'd rather do without
I'm done

But when I'm half way up out the door
tell me why I keep fallin for you
falling for you, falling for you
falling for you, falling for you
how do I keep loving you 
loving you, loving you
loving you, loving you 
why you gotta be complicated, complicated
so complicated, complicated, so complicated
whoaa whoaa

(WALE:)
Yeah complicated when all your feelings is confiscated
I give my love and hate you to this money I've been chasing
I mean I love you baby but I love my occupation
and you know my money talking you know my conversation
and I know you're heart to sacred
I'll take it I'll probably break it
to love me only naked don't need none of us thinking
I tell her that I'm leaving, she like boy you stunting
I'm like: you crazy?, she like: keep playing
Prada clothes a lover something for I was ..
we aint fought in a minute shawty let's have a toast
shawty buy you a coat, bottle body she dope
for the ..gotta get adios
I'm tryin I love her, don't know If i meant it
see my love is as strong as this beverage i been sippin
see my mental is different, I am heavenly gifted
she called me complicated, I can't even defend it

Late nights crying, thinkin why am i trying
this aint funny i aint smiling no no
what happened to the kissin and the lovin
if ain't it worth it than we just probably stop it
if you think I'm away from you then you buggin

But when I'm half way up out the door
tell me why I keep fallin for you
falling for you, falling for you
falling for you, falling for you
how do I keep loving you 
loving you, loving you
loving you, loving you 
why you gotta be complicated, complicated
so complicated, complicated, so complicated
whoaa whoaa---Lyrics submitted by Morgan.
