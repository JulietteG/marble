They say diamonds are forever
Their beauty will always remain
But put the two of us together
And those stones just roll away

Time goes by and rivers run dry
And mountains will crumble and fall
On that final day, when the smoke clears away
One thing will stand through it all
And the way our love is goin'
When this world comes to an end
We'll just start forever over again

When the colors all fade from the rainbow
And the ocean has swallowed the sun
Our two hearts heaven made will still love just the same
When everything is said and done

Time goes by and rivers run dry
And mountains will crumble and fall
On that final day, when the smoke clears away
One thing will stand through it all
And the way our love is goin'
When this world comes to an end
We'll just start forever over again---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
