Sign said 40 miles to Canada 
My truck tore across Montana 
Ian Tyson sang a lonesome lullaby 
And so I cranked up the radio 
Cause there's just a little more to go 
For I'd cross the border at that Sweet Grass sign 
I'm Alberta Bound 

This piece of heaven that I've found 
Rocky Mountains and black fertile ground 
Everything I need beneath that big blue sky 
Doesn't matter where I go 
This place will always be my home 
Yeah I've been Alberta Bound for all my life 
And I'll be Alberta Bound until I die 

It's a pride that's been passed down to me 
Deep as coal mines, wide as farmer's fields 
Yeah, I've got independence in my veins 
Maybe it's my down-home redneck roots 
Or these dusty 'ol Alberta boots 
But like a Chinook wind keeps coming back again

Im Alberta Bound
This piece of heaven that I've found 
Rocky Mountains and black fertile ground 
Everything I need beneath that big blue sky 
Doesn't matter where I go 
This place will always be my home 
Yeah I've been Alberta Bound for all my life 
And I'll be Alberta Bound until I die

Oh and it doesnt matter where I go
this place will always be my home 
I have been Alberta bound for all my life
And I'll be Albert bound until I die---Lyrics submitted by Justine.
