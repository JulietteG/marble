Search my heart, search my mind, search my soul-
Make me clean, make me new, make me whole

All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now submit to Your design

'Cause You are the One only that would give it all away for me. That would give it all away for me.

You are my strength, You are my God, You are my King
You make me laugh, You make me dance, You make me sing

All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now submit to Your design-

'Cause You are the One only that would give it all away for me. That would give it all away for me. That would give it all away for me.

Everything inside, everything outside,
I give it all away.
You never change
But you rearrange my heart more everyday.

All of my plans, all of my dreams
I lay them down before Your feet
All of my time, all that was mine
I now submit to Your design---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
