Go!

Come on! Come on! Come on!

For crying out loud I'm running from a comedown
God forbid i know I've been a letdown
Reaching for the sky while laying in a gutter
kicking and screaming i am singing bloody murder
(I am screaming bloody murder) x2

I'm alive
When I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control
I'm losing my soul x2

I can't be your angel when I'm living like a devil
Can't be your lover when I'm living like a rebel
Don't want your pity and i don't want your help
Don't try and save me go take care of yourself
(go take care of yourself) x2

I'm alive
When I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control
I'm losing my soul x2

I'M ALIVE!
Sick of the pain I'm sick of the sorrow
Sick of today I'm sick of tomorrow
I'm addicted to the misery in my head
I better stop before i end up dead

So i climb to the top
just to fall to the bottom

And i climb
to the top
just to fall
to the bottom

COME ON!
Come on! Come on! Come on!!

I'm alive
When I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control
I'm losing my soul x2

I can't be your angel when I'm living like a devil
Can't be your lover when I'm living like a rebel
Don't want your pity and i don't want your help
Don't try and safe me go take care of yourself---Lyrics submitted by Troy.
