Yes I did it and I'll do it again 
It doesn't matter if I am your best friend 
I don't think so 
You're not that smart 
Over and over it breaks my heart 
The cycle continues time for your crime 
The pain comes back in an ugly design 
Her makeup smears 
The tears that she cries 
Over and over every night 

Emotional swords slash my soul 
And now the pain takes control 
I think about you 
I think about me 
Think about the way that it used to be 
I need a bottle 
I need some pills 
I need a friend 
I need some thrills 
A shoulder to cry on a friend to depend on 
When life gets rough 

Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 
Time and time again 
You think about yourself before you think about me 

It's like a fight every single day 
It's always easy when you have it your way 
Deep in my heart 
In the depths of my soul 
My selfish ways are out of control 
I'm sorry that it comes down to this 
I punch through the wall as I break my fist 
The makeup smears 
Tears that we cry 
Over and over every night 

You're so selfish 
You're making me want to end this relationship 
You're making me want to end this 

Loving ties unwind 
Lost time behind 
Loving ties unwind 
Lost time behind---Lyrics submitted by Chris Stefanick.
