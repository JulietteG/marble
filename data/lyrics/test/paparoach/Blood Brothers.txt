Watch your back because the next man is comin'
And you don't know if the next man is dumbin'
Survival of the fittest what it is
I got yo back, you got my back, and that's the biz
Blood is rushing through my veins, I got the power
Channel the energy, and with my strength I will devour
Sickening thoughts are running through my head
That's when I realize I'm glad im not dead

Corruption and abuse, the salesman of our blood
For the public's craving, existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill

It was a dream and then it hit me, reality struck
And now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
Close to the buck 50, and we all stand strong
In respect to the family in the times of our insanity
And in the words of profanity, I describe our dysfunctional family
Blood brothers keep it real to the end, deeper than the thoughts that you think?
Not a trend!

Corruption and abuse, the salesman of our blood
For the public's craving, existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill

Again and again ...

Corruption and abuse, the salesman of our blood
For the public's craving, existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to KILL, KILL, KILL!!!!

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill ...---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
