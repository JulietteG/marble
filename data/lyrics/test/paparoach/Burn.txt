I didn't know you were a fake
Every lie straight to my face
So blind I could not see
Right behind my back you stabbed me
Should've know you were a bitch
Shut up you're making me sick
Little man you're nothing like me
Lying cheating so deceiving
I trusted you broke me down
And you screwed me over

Don't try to deny it
You cannot hide it
Ill be ignited
When I get to watch you burn
Burn Burn
I wanna watch you burn
Burn Burn
I wanna watch you burn
You're gonna get what you deserve
I wanna watch you burn

You turn me inside out
My world is upside down
You're not hurt are you happy now
Looking over your shoulder fucking me over
I trusted you sold me out
This is far from over

Don't try to deny it
You cannot hide it
Ill be ignited
When I get to watch you burn
Burn Burn
I wanna watch you burn
Burn Burn
I wanna watch you burn
Burn
I wanna watch you burn
You're gonna get what you deserve
You'll never learn

Yah

Your time has come now
Its your turn
I'll watch you burn
Burn Burn Burn
I wanna watch you burn
Burn Burn
I wanna watch you burn
You're gonna get what you deserve
You'll never learn

Yah

Your time has come now
Its your turn
I wanna watch you burn
Burn Burn
I wanna watch you burn
Burn Burn
I wanna watch you burn---
