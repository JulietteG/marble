Love me till it hurts

You are the poison
You are the pain
The one chemical inside my veins
Its true
I've been infected by you
I'm not a killer, no I'm not a saint
And there's nobody left that I can blame
Its true
I am the poison in you

Will you love me till it hurts?
Never leave me at my worst
Break this cycle, break this curse
Love me till it hurts
We are gather, we deserve
Tell me do I have your word?
Break this cycle, break this curse
Love me till it hurts

Love me till it hurts

We fell in love but then we went to war
Now I'm the enemy,I'm at your door
Its true
I'm only fighting for you
We thought that we can make it through the storm
Hell broke loose and then you fell from my arms
Its true
I couldn't hold on to you

Love me till it hurts---
