(feat. Royce da 5'9")

We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors

It feels like we are headed for a meltdown
Im trying as you said things start to rat out
I know that theres a really shitty system
Were breaking down the walls of this prison

We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors

So shine your light
Push the enemy back
When youre under attack
It will protect you

Kill the night
All we need is a spark
We can bury the dark, ignite
Come on and shine your light

We fell on this really big inferno
Illuminate our lives, we are eternal
Deny the inner head-on collision
We sacrifice ourself for the mission

We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors

So shine your light
Push the enemy back
When youre under attack
It will protect you

Kill the night
All we need is a spark
We can bury the dark, ignite
Come on and shine your light
Come on and shine your light

Madness come
Surrounds me as I fall into
Bad shit happens to all of us
Taxes and fabric of dermy
You know I didnt last this long
In anything less than a war
We could have a chance
Savage
Better that than the hazard

We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors

So shine your light
Push the enemy back
When youre under attack
It will protect you

Kill the night
All we need is a spark
We can bury the dark, ignite
Come on and shine your light

We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors
Come on and shine your light

We are the warriors
We are the warriors
We are the warriors
Come on and shine your light

We are the warriors
We are the warriors---
