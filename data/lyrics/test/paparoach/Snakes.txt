i got some problems 
with the snakes that are crawlin'
through my area
when the darkness has fallen
they'll stab you in the back
no shame that's right, what? what?

i keep my distance
cus' they're makin me crazy
stealin' from me 
you know those fuckers are lazy
my blood boils
fat turns to oil
step the fuck back
or you'll get buried in soil

over drama
or you can sleep with the fishes
my clutches are tight
and i'll take your last wishes
one for your money, two for your girl
three for your life now i fucked up your world

do you like how it feels to be
bit in the neck by the snake that kills
do you know how it feels to be
stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill
i don't like how it feels, check it!
do you like how it feels to be
stabbed in the back then watch the blood spill
break it down!

Yo! it's kinda funny how your runnin' your mouth man
your caught in a lie and there's no way out come on
betray your friends, and your peeps, and your family
livin' like a snake 
livin' like a bloody thief

check my speech
cus' it's deep like the sea
from me to you'll 
and from you'll back to me, Ha!
danger, danger! slay snakes like a ranger
military style fears god not a stranger

now tell me
tell me who's crews sicker
mines sicker
get on your knees and be a dick licker
one for your money, two for your girl,
three for your life now i fucked up your world.... CHECK IT!

do you like how it feels to be
bit in the neck by the snake that kills
do you know how it feels to be
stabbed in the back and watch the blood spill
i don't like how it feels, check it!
do you know how it feels to be
stabbed in the back and watch the blood spill

DO YOU LIKE HOW IT FEELS!
I DON'T LIKE HOW IT FEELS!
I DON'T LIKE IT!
I DON'T WANT IT!
I DON'T NEED IT!
I DON'T LIKE IT!
I DON'T WANT IT!
I DON'T NEED IT!
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP!

do you like how it feels to be
bit in the neck by the snake that kills
do you know how it feels to be
stabbed in the back and watch the blood spill
DO YOU LIKE HOW IT FEELS!
i don't like how it feels to be
bit in the neck by the snake that kills
by the snake that kills
by the snake that kills---Lyrics submitted by Brock.
