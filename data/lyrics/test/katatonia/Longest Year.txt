in the night of old I always wished
in the longest year that had me down
and i would freeze if you ever asked me
that was my way

confront the guilt and try to overcome
do not get away
i'm not there yet

i can see fire
when i fall behind
when i give up
my thoughts redefined
how cold is the flame
of our uncompromising future
how cold is the sun

the city lights are fading still
the coming sky so white
and i'm the dark of this our new day
this is my way

find the one
this weight will hold me down
how cold is the sun---
