Falling, Crying, Sleeping, through the air
with the evil, shadows, moving towards the sky!

Tomb spirits marching in the fields of eternal....life
crying like a God....a terrified...God!!

Falling, crying, sleeping in the air
with the evil, shadows, moving towards the sky!

[chorus riff]

Behold the ancient sky, clouds of lie
Souls can't sleep, until the throne's mastering..again!
Tomb of insomnia.........can't sleep

[guitar solo]

Uh!

Cry!! Cry!! Ahh!! Cry!!

Falling, crying, sleeping the land is weak
With the evil shadows, moving towards the sky!
Tomb spirits marching, in the fields of eternity
Laughing, rotting, tainted...this sorrow gone...

[whispering words]
to cry...of an ancient.??.into the sky
??

[guitar solo]

Behold the ancient sky, clouds are black
Souls can't sleep, or nor can I..........kill me! uh!

yaahh!!

[beggining riffs with organ]

uh!

yaahh!!

yaahh!!

[guitar riffs begin]

Now they fall, behold the angels
Their withering souls, in blood
They can't fly
And in confusing anger, they fall so low
Now I can't sleep
Purest sorrow, embrace my soul
I can't sleep
Ahh!---Lyrics submitted by mohamed.
