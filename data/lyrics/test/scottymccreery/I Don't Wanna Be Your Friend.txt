You got your girls, and I got my boys
You got your gotta see this pin it on Pinterest
While we're out makin' noise
You got your chick flick, we got the game
You got your getcha tan on all day long
While I'm fishin' off a tailgate

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your friend
Nah, already got enough of them
For chillin', grillin', four-wheelin'
Baby, that ain't what I'm feelin'
I don't wanna just hang out
Nah, that ain't what I'm talkin' 'bout
Baby, can't you tell by this kiss
I don't wanna be your friend

You got the tank top, and I got the jeep
We got an open road and a radio
With no place to be
You got that smile, and I got your hand
Oh, and if you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
I think you understand

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your friend
Nah, already got enough of them
For chillin', grillin', four-wheelin'
Baby, that ain't what I'm feelin'
I don't wanna just hang out
Nah, that ain't what I'm talkin' 'bout
Baby, can't you tell by this kiss
I don't wanna be your friend

No, I don't wanna be your friend

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Yeah, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Girl, that's for sure
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
'Cause I wanna be so much more

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be your friend
Nah, already got enough of them
For chillin', grillin', four-wheelin'
Baby, that ain't what I'm feelin'
I don't wanna just hang out
Nah, that ain't what I'm talkin' 'bout
Baby, can't you tell by this kiss
I don't wanna be your friend

Baby, let me show you again
I don't wanna be your friend
No, I don't wanna be your friend

I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be---
