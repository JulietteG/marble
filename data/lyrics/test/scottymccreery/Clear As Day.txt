You were sittin' on that
Silverado bumper
Outside our locker room
After the game
Glowin' in the tan you
Got that summer
I walked by and you said, hey
Yeah, that night's still clear as day.

First time we ever beat
East Lincoln County
Big party down at Ricky
Bowman's Place
I walked up, you threw your
Arms around me
And whispered, you loved to 
Watch me play
Yeah, that night's still clear as day.

There ain't one second, time's erased
Every detail is still in place
You hold to what you love
Some things never fade
And that night's still clear as day.

We went to get some fresh air
On the back porch
I put my class ring by the
Cross on your gold chain
You backed my back against 
Those cedar clapboards
My lips ain't never been 
Kissed that way
Yeah, that night's still clear as day.

There ain't one second, time's erased
Every detail is still in place
You hold to what you love
Some things never fade
And that night's still clear as day.

I walked you to your 
Brother's Silverado
When he climbed behind the 
Wheel he seemed ok
Last thing you said was,
I'll call you tomorrow,
That's a call you never got to make
They blamed it on the fog 
And pourin' rain

And that night's still clear as day..---Lyrics submitted by Allysha Neveldine.
