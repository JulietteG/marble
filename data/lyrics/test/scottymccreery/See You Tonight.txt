Girl you know I love talking to you on the phone
I could listen to your sweet voice all night long
Sometimes I can get by, with a sweet dreams baby good night,
But this time, well I don't wanna spend it alone

So I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze is blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
Holding you so tight under that porch light
But girl I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah

Got a couple hundred pictures of your beautiful face
On my phone, on my dash, all over the place
But I would drive a million miles
Just to see your little smile in real life
And baby it's worth the drive,
You're worth the drive

So I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze is blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
Holding you so tight under that porch light
But girl I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah

Baby I don't care what time it is,
I just gotta get a little moonlight kiss
Girl I can't help it when I feel like this
There's only one thing to do
Baby I'm missing you

So I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze is blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
Holding you so tight under that porch light
But girl I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight
Girl I gotta see you tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah---Lyrics submitted by xRx Team333.
