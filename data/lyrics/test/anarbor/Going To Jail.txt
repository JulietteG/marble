I'm not a bad guy and I've never been a thief.
I pay my taxes and I pretend to believe.
A family that loves me, yeah and a habit that saved my life.
I'm sorry, Officer,
I'm not sayin' shit tonight.

Oh, I'm going to jail, I won't make bail.
Oh God, I hate this town.
Oh, they're comin' to get me, I swear I'm not guilty.
Setting me up to bring me down.
Oh God, I'm going to jail.

I live slow days, but at night, I walk fast.
I'll keep my hair real short to make sure that they walk right past.
Search my car, my clothes,
I promise, Sir, I'm all dry.
I'm sorry, Officer,
I ain't got shit tonight.

Oh, I'm going to jail, I won't make bail.
Oh God, I hate this town.
Oh, they're comin' to get me, I swear I'm not guilty.
Setting me up to bring me down.
Oh God, I'm going to jail.

It was just a burn ride.
We can run, but we can't hide.

[Whistling]

Oh, I'm going to jail, I won't make bail.
Oh God, I hate this town.
They're comin' to get me, I swear I'm not guilty... yeah!

Oh, I'm going to jail, I won't make bail.
Oh God, I hate this town.
Oh, they're comin' to get me, I swear I'm not guilty.
Setting me up to bring me down...

Oh, I'm going to jail, won't make bail.
Oh God, I hate this town.
Oh, they're comin' to get me, I swear I'm not guilty, guilty, yeah!
Oh God, I'm going to jail.
