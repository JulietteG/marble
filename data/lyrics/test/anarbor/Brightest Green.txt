It was late last night before she hit me up
And baby, dont you know nothing good happens after midnight?
You see the night before I couldn't keep my hands off her
Yeah I wanted to drink her up
Her body burned like a fire and I knew, I knew I couldnt take anymore from her

I'm burn, burn, burning
My stomachs turning
My hearts giving into my eyes
I'm stare, stare, staring
at the skin she's sharing
My hearts giving into my eyes
Now its too late, for me its too late
I'm burn, burn, burning
Yeah my hearts giving into my eyes.

She stood 5'4"
She had the brightest green I'd ever seen, I've never seen these eyes before
And just like that I was hypnotized
I sit back, I roll fat, thinking of you
And I knew I couldnt take anymore from her

I'm burn, burn, burning
My stomachs turning
My hearts giving into my eyes
I'm stare, stare, staring
at the skin shes sharing,
My hearts giving into my eyes.
Now it's too late, for me it's too late,
I'm burn, burn, burning
Yeah my hearts giving into my eyes.

I'm sweatin bullets like a boy that has just been caught,
You say your love is all I need, but I dont need alot.
You say youre sorry but I know that you're not (x2)

I'm burn, burn, burning,
My stomachs turning,
My hearts giving into my eyes.
I'm stare stare staring
at the skin shes sharing,
My hearts giving into my eyes.
Now its too late, for me its too late,
Im burn, burn, burning,
Yeah my hearts giving into my eyes.
Now its too late, for me its too late,
I'm burn burn burning,
Yeah my hearts giving into my eyes.---Lyrics submitted by Sean.
