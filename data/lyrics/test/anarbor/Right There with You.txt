and i know how you feel 
im right there with you
but baby wont you come on
ill show you how to have some fun
and hunny this is gonnna hurt
but i swear its worth the ride
and if not its worth the high

cause late at night
wrong sounds more appealing than right
but sweet talk sweetie wont get the job done
cause late at night 
wrong sounds more appealing than right
but sweet talk sweetie just a twist of the tongue

and theres secret's we keep 
locked up inside of me
as if i spoke the truth
it'll rot out my teeth
and hunny this is gonna hurt
but i swear it worth the ride 
and if not its worth the high

cause late at night
wrong sounds more appealing than right
but sweet talk sweetie wont get the job done
cause late at night 
wrong sounds more appealing than right
but sweet talk sweetie just a twist of the tongue

i dream of sceams to make you believe
i speak in lines of lies to fill your thoughts
and ill be honest i havent been honest but you've been blind to see

cause late at night
wrong sounds more appealing than right
but sweet talk sweetie wont get the job done
cause late at night
wrong sounds more appealing than right 
but sweet talk sweetie wont get the job done
cause late at night
wrong sounds more appealing than right 
but sweet talk sweetie just a twist of the tongue
just sweet talk sweetie just a twist of the tongue---Lyrics submitted by Kylie.
