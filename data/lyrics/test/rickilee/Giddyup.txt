Like a boss gotta take control
Gotta make him work you're the CEO
Like a quarterback in the Superbowl
Bring your A-game time to Rock n Roll

Oh! Spice it up don't let it cool down
Take it off! It's time to go now
Saddle up and turn the light out
And then we start the show

Get on top tonight and ride it
Cos you know that's how he likes it
Rock back and forth and grind it
Tonight I'll be the pilot

So giddyup, get up and get on it
Gotta ride it, gotta ride it like you stole it
If you want it gotta show him how you want it
Giddyup! Giddyup! Giddyup!
Yeah!

Ride! Ride! Ride!
Giddyup! Giddyup! Giddyup!
Yeah!
Ride! Ride! Ride!
Giddyup! Giddyup! Giddyup!

I'm a good girl, but I'm not tonight
I want it so bad cos it feel so right
Play your cards right, I'll give you what you like
Give me my crown, I'm the Queen of the night!

Oh! Spice it up don't let it cool down
Take it off! It's time to go now
Saddle up and turn the light out
And then we start the show

Get on top tonight and ride it
Cos you know that's how he likes it
Rock back and forth and grind it
Tonight I'll be the pilot

So giddyup, get up and get on it
Gotta ride it, gotta ride it like you stole it
If you want it gotta show him how you want it
Giddyup! Giddyup! Giddyup!
