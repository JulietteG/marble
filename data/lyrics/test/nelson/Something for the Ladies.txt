Give her a ??
To shake your hips soft
Get that body on the floor
Give her a baseline
To teach that waistline
Get that body on the floor
On the floor
Where people come together
On the dancefloor
To check out one another
Hey DJ hey
Something for the ladies
Hey DJ Hey
Something for the ladies

Don't put on ?? vibe
We don't dance tonight
Get that body on the floor
Don't play no ??
Play that lo-so
Get that body on the floor
On the floor
Where people come together
On the dancefloor
To check out one another
Hey DJ hey
Something for the ladies
Hey DJ Hey
Something for the ladies

I said ladies, oh ladies
Get on the floor
Hey DJ hey
Something for the ladies
Hey DJ Hey
Something for the ladies

Hey DJ Hey
Something for the ladies
Hey DJ Hey
Something for the ladies
Hey
Hey
Hey---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
