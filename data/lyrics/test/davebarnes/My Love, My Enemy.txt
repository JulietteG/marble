What do you say
Lets give it an hour and just be done
Maybe were afraid
Of all that we will and wont become
Its hard to believe
The one closet to me 
Can feel so far away

Youre my pleasure in my pain
Youre my sunshine in my rain
Youre my darkest night when I'm lost at sea
Youre the shadows in my life
Youre the one that I need tonight
You are a stranger still to me
Youre my lady
My life, my love, my enemy

Every day we come together
Or come undone
Every time I break
Tell me again how far weve come
Its hard to believe
The one closest to me 
Can feel so far away
So far away

Youre my pleasure in my pain
Youre my sunshine in my rain
Youre my darkest night when I'm lost at sea
Youre the shadows in my life
Youre the one that I need tonight
You are a stranger still to me
Youre my lady, my life, my love, my enemy

Whoa, Whoa 
Were changing
Its painful
Were something good
Whoa, Whoa
Were changing
Its painful 
But its good

Youre my pleasure in my pain
Youre my sunshine in my rain
Youre my darkest night when I'm lost at sea
Youre the shadows in my life
Youre the one that I need tonight
You are a stranger still to me
Youre my lady, my life, my love, my enemy
Whoa, Whoa 
My love, my enemy (x2)
Whoa, Whoa---Lyrics submitted by Morgan.
