Staring at an empty cup of understanding
maybe you could fill it up
tell me why you left
I don't want to be alone in this ocean
people passing by rushing towards the end

and I can see your self reflection 
like a ghost on the earth
and I would do what ever I could
for a chance to have you here 
and be home again 
now that you're gone 
I can see I was wrong 
back in your arms
I feel home again 
now that you're gone 
I can see I was wrong
back in your arms again
again

Even as the clouds roll by
I swear they mock me 
cause every one that fills the sky 
turns into your face 
maybe it was heaven's fault, they lost an angel
couldn't hold on and I let her get away

and I can see your self reflection 
like a ghost on the earth
and I would do what ever I could 
for a chance to have you here
and be home again
now that you're gone 
I can see I was wrong 
back in your arms
I feel home again
now that you're gone 
I can see I was wrong 
back in your arms again

(home again)
now that you're gone
I can see I was wrong 
back in your arms again 
now that you're gone
I can see I was wrong
back in your arms again

(home again)
now that you're gone
I can see I was wrong
back in your arms 
I feel home again
now that you're gone
I can see I was wrong
back in your arms again

again---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
