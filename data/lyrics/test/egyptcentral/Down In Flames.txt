This separation makes a fool of you and I
Blank stares and credit cards allege the great divide
You think your safe if you don't ever choose a side
Are you sheep or wolves in disguise
Are you sheep or wolves in disguise

Wake up
It's now or never
You are all the slave
It's now or never

Wake up your generation
Wake up and save the nation
Wake up determination
I am afraid we're going down
Afraid we're going down in flames

I miss the soldiers of a new forgotten war
And I miss the friends that I cannot see anymore
We want a victory but I cannot ignore
Your self inflicted genocide
You are all the slave

It's now or never
You are all the slave
It's now or never

Wake up your generation
Wake up and save the nation
Wake up determination
I am afraid we're going down
Afraid we're going down in flames

Wake up your generation
Wake up and save the nation
Wake up determination
I am afraid we're going down
Afraid we're going down 

Wake up your generation
Wake up and save the nation
Wake up determination
I am afraid we're going down
Afraid we're going down in flames---Lyrics submitted by Tyrone Keats.
