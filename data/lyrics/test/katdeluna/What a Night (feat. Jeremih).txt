Everybody knows it, yep, that's my chick
Might take her to the club with me
Just to make her ex man sick, oh, oh
She complain that she lonely
So I took her back home with me
She gon' tell you I'm the homie
But you know that I know, broke this
She gon' ride for a real one all night

Oh what a night
Got my girl with me, got my girl with me tonight
And tonight we gon' party like it's 1999
Yeah, we gon' bring love back to the club
We gon' bring love, love to the club
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night

Everybody knows it, yep, I'm that chick
I'm the one that you bring home to momma
Now let me tell you one thing real quick
If these girls ain't for you, this chick is loyal
I'll do anything for you, tell me what you want
I'm the one that's gonna ride for a real one, all night, all night

Oh what a night
Got my man with me, got my man with me tonight
And tonight we gon' party like it's 1999
Yeah and we gon' bring love back to the club
And we gon' bring love, love to the club
Oh what a night
(Oh what a night)
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night

What you doing girl? The plan's on you
But I plan to put my hands on you
Go to Miami, put the tans on you
Take you to the KOD and put some bands on you
(Baby watch me while I dance on you
I ain't trippin' what my ex gon' do?)
Cause I'm gonna be with a real one all night

Oh what a night
Got my girl with me, got my girl with me tonight
And tonight we gon' party like it's 1999
Yeah, we gon' bring love back to the club
And we gon' bring love, love to the club
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night---
