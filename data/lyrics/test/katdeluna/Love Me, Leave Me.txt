The very first day of my life,
Was the day that you let me go
It was a blessing in disguise
Now I see that I'm beautiful
If only everything was fine
It was so disfunctional, now I've forgotten all the time
And all the things that was loving you...
Just like a boat from my past
Saying that you want me back (that was impossible so)

CHORUS:
Love me, leave me, cuz i won't ready close to goLove me, leave me
Cause ive already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain i felt before
If i only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
(if you love me leave me)
If you love me leave me alone

Now there used to be a time

That i woulda taken you back again
But now that i have you out my mind
Now i'm totally independent
So you can save your little lies
Cause i know whats happenin'
Your missin' me but say goodbye now
To all the days i was lovin' you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

If you really wanna help
Than you should go
Cause i promised myself
I'd let it alone
At the back of the shelf
Cause where i put what we had
I'll never gong back, no
