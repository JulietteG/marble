Pictures of you, I'm lookin' for
Something I can claim
I wait for a knock on my door
but it never came
music, it comes in from the streets
soft and subdued
straining my ears to make out the sounds
through the din of the afternoon
It's then that you know what you do

going out for a winters walk
Civil life wasn't for today
Called all the numbers in my black book
but everybody seemed distant and strange
maybe it's just how you feel on a winters day

Somebody cruel indecision set you up by yourself
and you go downtown, you act like they know you
better to show them than to show yourself
show yourself

lookin for quiet then it calls
something I can name
but the shortness of days leaves me rudderless
and I find myself drifting again
facing bellmont and fairlyfair
connect myself to courtly kind
with their wit and their cutting words
pare the skin that is left behind
cut to the critical mind

somebody cruel indecision set you up by yourself
you go downtown you act like they know you
better to show them than to show yourself
show yourself

Pictures of you x4

I can claim---Lyrics submitted by Piers Forrest.
