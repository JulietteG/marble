I cut off my hair
Put some red on every nail on my feet
I think it's pretty
I repainted all the rooms
Got a cat that I named June, obviously
I think she's happy
Friends threw some parties
I've been to them all there's not one that I missed

And I've tried to spend my time with somebody new
But everyone
Still reminds me of you
And tried to play some songs that change my point of view
But every sound
Still reminds me of you

I've done some walking
Listen to the people talk on the street
I don't feel lonely
I saw some movies
But your face kept coming back on the screen
I think I'm crazy
Can't make decisions
I could use some more distractions today

And I've tried to spend my time with somebody new
But everyone
Still reminds me of you
And tried to play some songs that change my point of view
But every sound
Still reminds me of you

I wonder where did I go wrong? What made you gone?
How I hate to feel alone

I've tried to spend my time with somebody new
But everyone
Still reminds me of you
And tried to play some songs that change my point of view
But every sound
Still reminds me of you
Still reminds me...---Lyrics submitted by zul.
