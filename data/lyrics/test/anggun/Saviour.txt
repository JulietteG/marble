Somewhere between my sleep
Somewhere beneath my skin
In places I can't see
Something is known to be a sin

Hiding inside my eyes
Burning from deep within
Something that needs a lie
Trying to turn into a sin

Rescue me before I lose control
Rescue me from this fire in my soul
There's only you who can stop me from falling
I need a saviour, need my saviour

Rescue me before I lose my head
Rescue me from the sight of regret
Cause only your love can stop me from wanting
I need a saviour, you're my saviour

Knocking behind my door
Asking to be let in
Something I have ignored
Wanting to be a sin

It's been around for so long
And waiting to begin
I know that it's so wrong
Can't let it be a sin---Lyrics submitted by Gus.
