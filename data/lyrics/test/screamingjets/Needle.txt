I feel a pain in my head
I want that sleep that I'm missin'
I'm falling all apart
But I have a nightmare that I'm livin'
and all the life that it's givin'
Oh I need that start

Failed an old friend and she died
Oh What a wasted life
so don't you start, don't you start your pushing
the needle to the red
the needle to the red no no no no

Well I feel the life that I'm leading
Is bringing me down and I'm bleeding, 
we're pushed aside to die.
Skull and crossbones in my mind
I start to believe my own lies
Oh why did I start

Chorus

Well I seem to wonder all the time,
What it'd be like if I could change my mind
Blood drips slowly from the sky
fallin' down, lands in my naked eye
break down and cry.

Blood shot eyes in the mirror
look at my hand it's a quiver
I'm a crawling heap in the dark
The lord has a spoon on the table
I take a drink and I'm able
I'm able to make that start
