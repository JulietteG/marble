Do you feel it?
It's in the air tonight
With every beating, with every step I come alive
Like a rainbow, let your colors out
And forever, lost in paradise

Spread a little love
If we spread a little love we'll never die
Spread a little love
If we spread a little love we'll never die

[beat break]

Heart's on fire, don't let them get you down
Just stay higher, keep on growing with every sound
Like a rainbow, let your colors out
And forever, lost in paradise

Spread a little love
If we spread a little love we'll never die
Spread a little love
If we spread a little love we'll never die

[beat break]

We'll never die

Do you feel it?
It's in the air tonight
And forever...

Spread a little love
If we spread a little love we'll never die
Spread a little love
If we spread a little love we'll never die

[beat break]

We'll never die---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
