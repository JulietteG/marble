We so high, we can't come down
The world can't touch us now
Were runnin' wild, were making out
The world can't touch us now

We can do whatever we want, yeah, yeah
We can do whatever we want, yeah, yeah
We can do whatever we want, yeah, yeah
We can do what-what...whatever we want

I like you inside out
Let's go sell riffa now
We could go all night long
Go hard, or you go home

We walkin' on the wild
Bite down like crocodile
We could go all night long
Go hard, or you go home

We so high, we can't come down
The world can't touch us now
Were runnin' wild, were making out
The world can't touch us now

We can do whatever we want, yeah, yeah
We can do whatever we want, yeah, yeah
We can do whatever we want, yeah, yeah
We can do what-what...whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want

I like you inside out
Let's go sell riffa now
We could go all night long
Go hard, or you go home

We walkin' on the wild
Bite down like crocodile
We could go all night long
Go hard, or you go home

I wanna live my life straight outta the box
And throw away the key, breakin' all of the locks
I'm gonna jump right into whatever I want
Yeah whatever I want to, whatever we want

We so high, we can't come down
The world can't touch us now
Were runnin' wild, were making out
The world can't touch us now

We can do whatever we want, yeah, yeah
We can do whatever we want, yeah, yeah
We can do whatever we want, yeah, yeah
We can do what-what...whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want
Whatever we want

I wanna live my life straight outta the box
And throw away the key, breakin' all of the locks
I'm gonna jump right into whatever I want
Yeah whatever I want to, whatever we want ---
