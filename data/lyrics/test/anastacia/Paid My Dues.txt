I've been knocked down
It's a crazy town
Even got a punch in the face in LA
Ain't nothing in the world that you keep
Me from doing what I wanna do

'Cause I'm too proud, I'm too strong
Live by the code that you gotta move on
Feeling sorry for yourself
And got nobody nowhere

So I...
(Held my head high)
Knew I (Knew I survive)
Well I made it (I made it)
I don't hate it (Don't hate it)
That's just the way it goes
Yeah
I done made it through
Stand on my own two
I paid my dues, yeah
Tried to hold me down
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues

Now I'm still tested every day
People try to mess with Anastacia
Gotta nothing in common
Cause I handle mine
And I thought I better let you know

I'm no punk I can't get down
I don't give a damn about whos around
That was just fine 'til now

So I...
(Held my head high)
Knew I (Knew Id survive)
Well I made it (I made it)
Oahh (Don't hate it)
That's just the way it goes
Yeah

I done made it through
Stand on my own two
I paid my dues
Yeah (Tried to hold me down)
You can't stop me now
I paid my dues, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Took so long to get me here (here)
But I won't live in fear (fear)
You try to steal my shine (shine)
But first they wanna build you up (up)
Then they tear you down (down)
It's a struggle, you try to bubble

So I...
(Held my head high)
Knew I (Knew Id survive)
Oahh (I made it)
(Don't hate it)
Said that's - just - the - wayyyyy
(I done made it through)
(Stand on my own two)
I said I paid my, I paid my dues
Yeahhhhh
(Tried to hold me down)
But you can't stop me now (you can't stop me now)
(I paid my dues) I paid my, paid my dues
(I done made it through) oahhh
(Stand on my own two) 
I paid my (I paid my dues) oahhh
Tried to hold me down
But you can't stop me now 
I paid my dues (I paid my dues)---Lyrics submitted by Pasqua Martinez.
