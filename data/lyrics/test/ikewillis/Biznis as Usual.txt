I didnt know it was my conviction
To be the causing of all this friction
And then you say that I rob and steal you
But what youre saying is thats the real you

You may try but you may not stop me
You may shoot but you may not drop me
Youre the cause of all my troubles

And everybody real European
Cannot imagine the world Im seein
Can anybody whose mind is fair
Be so apart of the hatred there

Its a start, but its just beginning
And theres always a chance of winning
Youre the cause of all my troubles

Yes, you know that youre on your way
People love everything you gotta say
Youre the king (youre that thing)
Youre the king of all you survey

You think Im some kinda dumeraisel?
Im not here waiting for your appraisal
You think Im here for career improvement
I think youre thinking the wrong damn movement

You may try but you may not stop me
You can shoot but you may not drop me
Youre the cause of all my trouble

Yes, you know that youre on your way
People love everything you gotta say
Youre the king (youre that thing)
Youre the king of all you survey

I didnt know it was my conviction
To be the causing of all this friction
And then you say that I rob and steal you
But what youre saying is thats the real you---Lyrics submitted by Paulo.
