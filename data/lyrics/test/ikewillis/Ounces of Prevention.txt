There you go again
Counting chicks before they hatch
Youre a snowball in hell
Lord, I Lord, I aint got time for that
Girl, you bring me to me knees
Squeeze the blood out of a stone
Money still dont grow on trees
An girl you done me wrong

Ounces o Prevention/Another pound o cure
After singing every cliche/ I still cant be too sure
So tired of all the plastic/every single bad cliche
Now theres drastic and theres Drastic
But there are another ways

Ill never write a song that says:
Baby, baby, take my hand
All this running in the night
You have got to understand
That Ill never ever sing you
That this feeling is so right
Or When you look at me, baby,
All we got is tonight

Ounces o Prevention/Another pound o cure
After being with you, baby/I still cant be too sure
Ah, the misguided contact/From your Pedestal of Steel
After all youd care to mention/This program is for real

I tell you
Maybe  you must think that Im crazy
Cause I dont see you anymore
I tell you Oh no! It must be  I say so!
Cause I dont see you anymore

I cant see myself singin/Yknow this night will last forever
When you look into my eyes/I cant sing that stuff
No, never
But i know if I dont do it/Somebody probly will
Theyll be Billboard with a bullet
And I eat the bitter pill

I said that
Maybe  you must think that Im crazy
Cause I dont see you anymore
I tell you Oh no! It must be  I say so!
When I dont feel you anymore

Ounces o Prevention/Another pound o cure
After being with you, baby/I still cant be too sure
Oh, the misguided contact/From your Pedestal of Steel
After all youd care to mention/This program is for real
After all youd care to mention/This program is for real
After all youd care to mention/This program is for real---Lyrics submitted by Paulo.
