I tell you: I love my girl
Ill see you later 
Theres too much that I can do
I got to go, no, I cant stay here
I should not be here by you
Sleepy, I love you
They question me, and they try to see
How youve taken my mind away

See you later
See you later

The girls tell you that Im a phoney
I can only do my share
And the times that you were cold n lonely
My overtures to you are fair
Sleepy, I love you
They question me, still it escapes me
How youve taken my mind away

See you later
I know
See you later

I do not want to control ya
I just want things to be real
And I dont like those bad surprises
I especially dont like asking Whats the deal?

Its on your face, just cant erase
How youve taken my mind away

See you later
I just dont know
But I see you later

Sleepy
Sleepy
Sleepy...---Lyrics submitted by Paulo.
