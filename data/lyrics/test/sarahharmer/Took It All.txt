You said I could have it all
You said it to me
With your eyes so wide, excited
I stopped to see what you mean
In the drone of afternoon traffic
On a slope that's slippery
In the relative fear invited
That keeps us company

We took it all
Without taking it away
We shook it
It didn't blow up in our face
This life's abundancy
'came clear
to me.

These hands are holding a kite of worry
Floats high and circles a pivot of fear
In the wind are the words that say there's no time, hurry
So we grab what we can
We think the end is near.

We took it all
Without taking it away
We shook it
It didn't blow up in our face
This life's abundancy
'came clear.

We can get back up
We can move from this ground
To where there is enough of everything

What has opened up 
This crevice at our feet
Has created a new sense of 
Urgency

Without taking it away
We shook it
It didn't blow in our face
This life's abundancy
'came clear.---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
