I can't sleep in this room
Still so far from finding you
I can't see, I dig beneath
The piles of dirt they cover me

Don't let go
Don't let go
We can crawl out out of the shadows
Don't let go
Don't let go
We can find our way back home

Silence keeps our story straight
Fighting for a perfect stake
Wave your flag or I believe
Hope is comfort if not relief

Don't let go
Don't let go
We can crawl out out of the shadows
Don't let go
Don't let go
We can find our way back...

And there's a heart that still can beat 
Of every breath that's inside me
And find the spark that's buried deep
And won't go out, so please...

Don't let go
Don't let go
We can crawl out out of the shadows
Don't let go
Don't let go
We can find our way back home---Lyrics submitted by Thomas.
