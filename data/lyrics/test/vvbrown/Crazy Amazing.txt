I never met a guy like you before
It's really kinda funny how you knocked on my door
It's crazy how you got me feeling funny oh so deep inside

I can't believe you lay here inside my bed
A guy like you won't leave things inside my head
You magically appeared in the secret winces of my life iiife 

He loves me so
I can't believe how he needs me, oh
I think it's crazy amazing
How you can just bump into a guy, fall in love, change your life

I've always been the bottle that sits on the shelf
I even start to think about my mental health
'Cos every other guy I seem to like would run a million miles

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
My oh my
My friends are gonna think that I tell those lies
It's not easy to believe me 'cos I've never had a guy like this
No, no, no

He loves me so (He loves me)
I can't believe how he needs me, oh (He needs me)
I think it's crazy amazing (Crazy amazing)
How you can just bump into a guy, fall in love, change your life

How love could be right
Never had a lover in my whole life
Could this be the way to a brighter light
Dreamin' 'bout this man since the beginning of time

He loves me so (Ooh, he loves me so)
I can't believe how he needs me, oh (I believe that he needs me, oh)
I think it's crazy amazing (Crazy amazing)
How you can just bump into a guy, fall in love, change your life
(Bump into a guy, fall in love, change your life)

He loves me so (Oh, he loves me so)
I can't believe how he needs me, oh (I can't believe how he needs me, oh)
I think it's crazy amazing (Crazy amazing)
How you can just bump into a guy, fall in love, change your life
(Bump into a guy, fall in love)---Lyrics submitted by Mila.
