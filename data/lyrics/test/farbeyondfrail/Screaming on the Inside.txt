Walking alone
I never knew that summer could feel so cold
Does anyone notice me at all?
I never knew that Id feel so small
On my own
Im screaming on the inside
Cuz its the only place Im heard
If anybody sees me, could you look me in the eye?
I need someone to touch me, so I know that Im alive
This worlds too
Big
To be outside looking in
Curled up in a coffee shop
Writing about things that break my heart
Like seeing two lovers meet
And how they can speak without saying a thing
While Im screaming on the inside
Im just dying to be heard
If anybody sees me, could you look me in the eye?
I need someone to touch me, so I know that Im alive
This worlds too
Big
To be outside looking in
I go outside just to breathe in
Silence is so loud
Think its gonna win
Im tired of thinking about life
I only want someone to be here when I
Turn out the lights
Im screaming on the inside
Tonight I might just scream myself to sleep
If anybody sees me, could you look me in the eye?
I need someone to touch me, so I know that Im alive
This worlds too
Big
To be outside looking in
This worlds too
Big
To be outside looking in
Someone pull me in...
Someone pull me in...---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
