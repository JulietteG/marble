Its been a long week
And now Im drinking
Its just to say that,
Nothing has changed
I met somebody
Tried hard to love him
But I guess it turned out the same
One too many nights
Spent sleeping with someone I dont know
I keep saying its all right
Gotta be better than being alone
After so many lovers
Why I am so far from love?
How many heartsll be broken
Before I finally fall in love?
Another late night
Candles burning
Another love, tossed into the flames
Im gonna sit and watch
The fire dying
Pray to God
I dont end up that way
One too many nights
Spent fumbling someones heart to the floor
Tell me itll be all right
Cuz I probly cant take too much more
After so many lovers
Why am I so far from love?
How many heartsll be broken
Before I finally fall in love?
Doesnt matter
How much you love me
I still cant learn
How not to leave
After so many lovers
Why am I so far from love?
How many heartsll be broken
Before I finally fall in love?
After so many lovers
Why am I so far from love?
How many heartsll be broken
Before I finally fall in love?---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
