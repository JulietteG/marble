I remember how your teeth felt
On the back
On the back of my neck
I remember stars that seemed too bright
Lighting up that surreal night
Like little angels.
I remember how your lips moved
Softly across every inch of my skin
I remember lying on my back
My hands gripping the grass
Like I was falling
And I remember thinking that
In a few hours now
Its gonna rain
In just a few hours now
Its gonna change
Things change in the morning rain
Cuz Baby night is easier to take
First thing I said, when the stars went away
Is I knew wed touch, I knew wed touch
But I didnt know youd stay
I remember how your hands felt
When they touched
Touched a sinner like me
I remember wondering if the breeze
Was whispering to the autumn leaves
Shes forgiven.
And I remember thinking that
In a few hours now
Its gonna rain
In just a few hours now
Its gonna change
Things change in the morning rain
Cuz Baby night is easier to take
First thing I said, when the stars went away
Is I knew wed touch, I knew wed touch
But I didnt know youd stay
My love, my love, my love
If those night feelings start to fade
Hang on, hang on, hang on
My love, my love, my love
Those starsll come back someday
Just hang on, my love, hang on
Things change in the morning rain
Cuz Baby night is easier to take
First thing I said, when the stars went away
Is I knew wed touch, I knew wed touch
But I didnt know youd stay
I didnt know youd stay
Oh I didnt know youd stay---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
