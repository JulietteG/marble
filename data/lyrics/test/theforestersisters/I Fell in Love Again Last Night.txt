I fell in love again last night
you keep doing everything just right
you've got me wrapped around your fingers
and every morning the love still lingers 
I fell in love again last night

when you kissed me 
the way you've always done
like the first time you were with me
and my heart just came undone
lying here this morning
boy I know your still the one

I fell in love again last night
you keep doing everything just right
your the reason my heart keeps beating
and every morning it keeps repeating
I fell in love again last night

we were talking
'bout some future plans
and how far we've come together
sinse the night it all began
then you reached out to touch me
and guess what happened then

I fell in love again last night
you keep doing everything just right
your the reason my heart keeps beating
and every morning it keeps repeating
I fell in love again last night
in love again last night
I fell in love again last night---Lyrics submitted by Erin.
