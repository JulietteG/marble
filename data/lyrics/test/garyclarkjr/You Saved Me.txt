(Verse 1)
It's taken me a little while to bounce back
I've been falling from something good

People say I took a little too long
Oh, I did, yeah
(Oh baby, oh)

(Hook)
'Til you came along and you saved me
You saved me
With that good love

You came along and you saved me
You saved me
Oh, with that good love

(Verse 2)
It's taken me a little while to call back
I been working on something good
(oh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh)

So every now and then I tend to fall back
Oh, love, I've been misunderstood 
(oh, oh, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

(Hook)
'Til you came along and you saved me
You saved me
With that good love
(Oh, yeah, yeah)

You came along and you saved me
You saved me
Oh, with that good love
(Oh, yeah, yeah, ah)

(Bridge)
You got it all baby
I'm so addicted, I
I can't hep it
Wanting more and more and more
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You got it all baby
I'm so addicted, I

Wanting more and more and more

(Hook x2)
'Til you came along and you saved me
You saved me
With that good love
(Yeah)

You came along and you saved me
