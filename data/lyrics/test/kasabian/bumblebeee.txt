Get them a message, a message from me
I'm caught up in love and I'm in ecstasy
What can I do now when nothing's the same
And all that I know I wanna do it again

Well tell me now
Life is so simple when you are with me
'Cause when we're together I'm in ecstasy
I'm in ecstasy
I'm in ecstasy
I'm in ecstasy

All you pretty things
Get on board this mothership
I said all you got to be
Is ready for action, baby

Don't think I'm twisted, as a matter of fact
Welcome you now to the second act
Where I fight off robots and the men in the suits
Wear out the soles of your monkey boots

Well tell me now
Can't get enough of the sunshine
Can't get enough of the moonlight
And all the colours that are coming on strong
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on

Can't get enough of the oceans
Can't get enough of the mantra
All we will ever feel is ecstasy
We're in ecstasy
We're in ecstasy
We're in ecstasy

All you pretty things
Get on board this mothership
I said all you got to be
Is ready for action, baby

Well tell me now
Can't get enough of the sunshine
Can't get enough of the moonlight
And all the colours that are coming on strong
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on

Can't get enough of the oceans
Can't get enough of the mantra
All we will ever feel is ecstasy
We're in ecstasy
We're in ecstasy
We're in ecstasy

All you pretty things
Get on board this mothership
I said all you got to be
Is ready for action, baby
Ready for action, baby
Ready for action, baby ---
