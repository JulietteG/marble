Hey, hey disbeliever
You're bleeding me dry
Come on now listen to reason
And everything will be fine

I can't understand why you're so underhanded
You're just not yourself
Pretending to be something you don't believe in
Is bad for your health
I don't know why you're trying to hide
Now don't be so afraid
Always regretting
And never forgetting
The mistakes that you've made

Hey, hey disbeliever
You're bleeding me dry
Come on now listen to reason
And everything will be fine

If craving attention
And needing redemption is all part of the game
Nothing will ever be different
And we will all be insane
To hell with your habit
I'm not gonna have it
I'm tossing away my concern
Always a liar
Playing with fire
And you will get burned

I wish it didn't have to be like this
Love doesn't lie
I'll testify
That's just the truth
And I dare you to defy
And to show me the proof

Hey, hey disbeliever
You're bleeding me dry
Come on now listen to reason
And everything will be fine

Hey, hey disbeliever
We want to see ya
Try not to panic

You're such a long way from home
You're such a long way from home
You're such a long way from home
You're such a long way from home

Revenge can be sweet
And romance can be sour
We haven't much time
To dissect and devour
Love doesn't lie down
Now that's just the truth
I dare you to defy
And to show me the proof
I wish it didn't have to end like this

There are answers
No second chances
Given beyond the grave
So here's to the fucked up decisions we've made

Hey, hey disbeliever
You're bleeding me dry
Come on now listen to reason
And everything will be fine

Hey, Hey
To reason.
We want to see ya
Don't panic---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
