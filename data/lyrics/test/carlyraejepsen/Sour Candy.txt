Sour candy endings
Coffee stained but where?
Oh, I'm so tangled up in my
Big sunglasses and
Bed hungry Second day fare

No we went under
(the weight was too much to carry and)
I felt the thunder
Mister don't look so scared.
I never knew, I never knew
That I could be so sad we went under

And I've been, very
Cautious
Trying numbness, instead of pain.
All your humor makes me,
makes me nauseous
What a twisted, twisted (twisted)
Game

No we went under
(the weight was too much to carry and)
I felt the thunder
Mister don't look so scared.
I never knew, I never knew
That I could be so sad we went under

Oh get yourself home
You leave him alone
On second thought I regret
the things to let so
Ooooh, oh hooo

Sour candy endings
I was barely even there

No we went under
(the weight was too much to carry and)
I felt the thunder
Mister don't look so scared.
I never knew, I never knew
That I could be
So sad
So sad
So sad
So sad
So sad we went under---Lyrics submitted by Ezekiela.
