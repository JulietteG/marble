All alone, here I am
I don't know what I'm after
Now that you're just a friend
I can't call you and ask you
From the very first time I saw your face

I knew I was satisfied
You were talking so sweet I had to taste
I wish I never tried

I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kissed me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do
And how's it gonna be
Cause breaking us in two
It's breaking me in pieces

Breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kissed me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do
And how's gonna be
I've given up, I'm going out tonight
Turn me up, turn me on
I'll turn me up, I'll turn me on

Tonight here you are
And I know what you're after
But you're reading me wrong
'Cause I'm closing this chapter

And from the very first time I saw your face
I knew I was satisfied
You were talking so sweet, I had to taste
I wish I never tried

I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kissed me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do
And how's it gonna be
Cause breaking us in two
It's breaking me in pieces

Breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kissed me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do
And how's it gonna be
I'm giving up and going out tonight
Turn me up (turn me up), turn me on (turn me on)
Turn me up (turn me up), and turn me on (and on, and on)

Turn me up, turn me on
Turn me up, and turn me on (and on)

I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kissed me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do
And how's it gonna be
I'm giving up and going out tonight
Turn me up (turn me up), turn me on (why don't you turn me on)
Turn me up (why don't you turn me on), turn me on (and on, and on, and on)
Turn me up (why don't you turn me on), turn me on (turn me on, turn me on)
Turn me up (turn me up), turn me on ---
