Right here, all by myself
I ain't got no one else
The situation is bleeding me
There's no relief for a person like me

Depression's got a hold of me
Depression-i gotta break free
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression's gonna kill me

I ain't got no friends to call my own
I just sit here all alone
There's no girls that want to touch me
I don't need your goddamn sympathy

Depression's got a hold of me
Depression-i gotta break free
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression's gonna kill me

Everybody just get away
I'm gonna boil over inside today
They say things are gonna get better
All I know is they fuckin' better

Depression's got a hold of me
Depression-i gotta break free
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression's gonna kill me

Depression's got a hold of me
Depression-i gotta break free
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression's gonna kill me---Lyrics submitted by Dawnie Hall.
