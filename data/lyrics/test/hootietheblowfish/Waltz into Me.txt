Years of trying to keep myself free 
Now I find that I'm down on my knees 
I kept hiding the feeling I had 
Locked away everyday, Lonesome and sad 
When I'm with you girl, the fear in me leaves 
To be in your world is all that I dream 
When I walk away you waltz into me 
Softly, Slowly 

Time has shown me the error of my ways 
I try to find you day after day 
Our time has come now, our friends have all said 
Waltz into me, talk to me 
Our love has no end 

When I'm with you girl, the fear in me leaves 
To be in your world is all that I dream 
When I walk away you waltz into me 
Softly, Slowly 
I've hidden as long as I can 

[Bridge:]
I see it's all in my head 
You're the best thing I've ever had 
Won't you dance with me night after night 

When I'm with you girl, the fear in me leaves 
To be in your world is all that I dream 
When I walk away you waltz with me 
Softly, slowly 
Then you hold me softly 
And you love me slowly 
You know that our love has no end---Lyrics submitted by louie.
