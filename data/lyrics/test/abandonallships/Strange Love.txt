Stay awake and look in to our future.
Just breathe my name 
And Let the music come alive

We get into Shkraps
Wherever we go
Hold on to girls
Before you grab them Bro

We partied up 
Till Last call
We don't give a fuck
We came to brawl 

All I do is party 
Feel up your body
Fist Pump Like Pauly D
We're growing up gotti

She's looking so hot hot
Gotta get them some shots shots
Bring her back Spot spot
Show her what i got got

All I do is party,
Feel up my your body,
Fist pump like Pauly D
We're growing up gotti.

Dance like you fuck 
Dance
Dance like you fuck
Dance 
Dance---Lyrics submitted by Pacie Ann.
