Leave your mark under my skin
Oh my how strong you are
And feast your eyes on my disdain
And hope this one won't scar

I will never belong to you again
I will never belong to you
Push if you still need my pain
Cause I will never tell
And scream if you still hate my name
Cause I'll be where I fell

Come sit close to me
Let me feel your breath
Come sit close to me
Hands around my neck
Come sit close to me
Let me feel your breath
Come sit close to me
close to me yeah

I will never belong to you again
I will never belong to you

And if I decide that I am alive
Than I'm diseased and ungrateful
And if I confide that I am a liar
Than I'm diseased and ungrateful
Push it in 'til it breaks 
if it bleeds I'll be okay

If I decide that I am alive
Than I'm diseased and ungrateful
If I confide that I am a liar
Than I am alive and I'm diseased and ungrateful
If I decide that I am alive
Than I'm diseased and ungrateful
If I confide that I am a liar
Than I am alive and I'm diseased and ungrateful

Come sit close to me
Come sit close to me
Come sit close to me
Come sit close to me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
