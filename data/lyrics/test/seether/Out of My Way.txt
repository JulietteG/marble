OUT OF MY WAY!
OUT OF MY.......WAY!

I can't pass up this opportunity, to make myself absurd
I can't pass up this opportunity, to let myself be heard
Would you, like to
be the one who see's me lose this all
Would you, like to
be the one who see's me fall!

Nobody's going to stand in my way!
Give it up son I'm doing this my way
Nobody's going to stand in my way!
Give it up son I'm doing this my way

You like to think the worst is over now
but you cant breath at all
You like to think your owed a favor now
Man you've seen it all
Did you, want to, be the one who pushed me off the wall
Did you, want to, be the one who let me fall!

Nobody's going to stand in my way!
Give it up son I'm doing this my way
Nobody's going to stand in my way!
Give it up son I'm doing this my way

You can't hold me down
You can't hold me down
You can't hold me down!
You can't hold me down!

I can't pass up this opportunity, to make myself absurd
I can't pass up this opportunity, to let myself be heard
Would you, like to, be the one who see's me lose this all
Would you, like to, be the one who see's me fall!

Nobody's going to stand in my way!
Give it up son I'm doing this my way
Nobody's going to stand in my way!
Give it up son I'm doing this my way
Nobody's going to stand in my way!
Give it up, I'm doing this my way
Nobody's going to stand in my way!
Give it up, I'm doing this my wayyyyy!
