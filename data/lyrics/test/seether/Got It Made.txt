You make me feel like a whore
Like im the one whose there to bore... you... now...
It's always gonna be this way

GET THE FUCK AWAY!!!

Cause I can't seem to show you
What you wanna see
I can never give you
Anything you need
I'm sick of wasting time on 
what can never be
I cannot control you
Into wanting me

You always wanna steal the light
By stepping on the ones who fight... for... you....
It's always gonna be the same

GET THE FUCK AWAY!!!

Cause I can't seem to show you
What you wanna see
I can never give you
Anything you need
I'm sick of wasting time on 
what can never be
I cannot control you
Into wanting me

I..HATE..WHAT YOU ARE
I'll BREAK YOU AND LEAVE..YOU..SCARRED
I..HATE..WHAT YOU ARE
I'll BREAK YOU AND LEAVE..YOU..SCARRED
I..HATE..WHAT YOU ARE

Cause I can't seem to show you
What you wanna see
I can never give you
Anything you need
I'm sick of wasting time on 
what can never be
I cannot control you
Into wanting me....now

Into wanting me....now

Into wanting me....now

Into wanting me....now

Into wanting me....---Lyrics submitted by bobbie.
