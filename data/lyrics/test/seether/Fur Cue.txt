Its all too revealing
 Your words are deceiving
 I cant let you get in my way
 I sense all your actions are meant as distractions
 You must know I wont play your game
 Fake, youre more than I can take
 And somethings gonna break
 Get out of my head
 No shame, youre passing all the blame
 And nothings gonna change
 Get out of my head

You made me realize that its all a lie
 And it comes as no surprise
 Stay for a while
 Stay cause you make me smile
 Theres no compromise

Im sick of pretending
 The thoughts are unending
 I cant let you get in my way (theres no way home)
 Im no longer bending
 My mind set is mending
 And now I have something to say (deny me)
 Fake, youre more than I can take
 And somethings gonna break
 Get out of my head
 No shame, youre passing all the blame
 And somethings gonna change
 Get out of my head

You made me realize that its all a lie
 And it comes as no surprise
 Stay for a while
 Stay cause you make me smile
 Theres no compromise

Fake, youre more than I can take
 And somethings gonna break
 Get out of my head
 Shame, youre passing all the blame
 And nothings gonna change
 Get out of my head

You made me realize that its all a lie
 And it comes as no surprise
 Stay for a while
 Stay cause you make me smile
 I see no compromise

Stay for a while
 Stay cause you make me smile
 I see no compromise
 Stay for a while
 Stay cause you make me smile
 Theres no compromise---Lyrics submitted by kram ekniets.
