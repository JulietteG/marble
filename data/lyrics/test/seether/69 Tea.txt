Lonely in this white room, there are pads everywhere
Chafing straitjacket, I wont die in there
Save me smiling Jesus, get off that cross
Hate me screaming masses
I dont care if Im lost
Dont tell me that youre all better
I dont care if you are Dont tell me that youre trendsetters
I dont care if you are

Lowly with my head bowed, there are rats everywhere
Feed me bread and water
I wont die in there
Save me smiling Jesus, get off that cross
Hate me screaming masses
I dont care if Im lost

Dont tell me that youre all better
I dont care if you are Dont tell me that youre trendsetters
I dont care if you are

Say you will take my pills
Say you will faking ill

Dont tell me that youre all better
I dont care if you are Dont tell me that youre bed wetters
I dont care if you are
Say you will take my pills
Say you will faking ill
Say you will (say you will) take my pills (take my pills)
Say you will (say you will) faking ill---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
