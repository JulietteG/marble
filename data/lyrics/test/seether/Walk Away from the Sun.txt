Walk away from the sun come slowly undone
I can see in your eyes I've already won
I could bleed for a smile I could cry for some fun
Walk away from the sun and tell everyone 
yeah

There's so much left in the air
So much to tell from the stares
There's so much left to defend 
But I am no fun

So turn away from the ones who hurt everyone
I can tell by your smile you're coming undone
I could bleed for a smile could die for a gun
Walk away from the sun and kill everyone
yeah

So tiny dancer beware
We're medicated and scared
This smile is so hard to wear
but I have no gun

So turn away from the ones who hurt everyone
I can tell by your smile you're coming undone
I could bleed for a smile
could die for a gun
Walk away from the sun and kill everyone

And you're fading with every day
You could have been the next one should have been enough for me

And you're fading with every day
You could have been the next one should have been enough for me

And you're fading with everyday 
You could have been the next one should have been enough for me

And you're fading with every day 
You could have been the next one should have been enough for me

Whooaaa


There's so much left in the air
So much to tell from the stares
There's so much left to defend
But I am no fun

Fading with everday
You could have been the next one should have been enough for me

Fading with everyday
You could have been the next one should have been enough for me

And you're fading with everyday
You could have been the next one should have been enough for me

And you're fading with everyday 
You could have been the next one should have been enough for me

whoa

Walk away from the sun (fading with every day)
Walk away from the sun (fading with every day)
Walk away from the sun (and you're fading with every day)
Walk away from the sun (and you're fading with every day)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
