She's wearin' dresses on the borderline 
(lookin good)
Or making senses that were lost in time 
(make amends)
This liberation is the one they'll love for ages
 (hey man I see them comin' again)
Just cut those dresses make you look so fine
(you're a ten)
Put on that shirt and you'll look so divine 
(i'm impressed)
This generation won't forgive those signs of aging
 (hey man I see them comin' again)

I got my ticket for the next makeover
I got my ticket for a stolen ride

I believe
I believe
I believe in the fallen
I believe
I believe
I believe in the callin'

They got injections for those facial lines
(make amends)
Break out the scalpel keep the nose defined 
(look again)
A crucifixion of the love we've known for ages 
(hey man i see them comin' again)
You're much too pretty you don't need your mind 
(just pretend)
Just bat them eyelids get your heart's desires 
A resurrection of the shallow and the vapid 
(hey man I see them comin')

I got my ticket for the next makeover
I lost my taste for this I'll keep my pride
I believe
I believe
I believe in the fallen
I believe
I believe
I believe in the callin'

Reject

I got my ticket for the next makeover
I lost my taste for this
I'll keep my pride
I believe
I believe
I believe in the fallen
I believe
I believe
I believe in the callin' 

I believe 
I believe
I believe in the fallen
I believe
I believe
I believe in the callin'---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
