Take me, far away, anywhere
As long as it's fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun, I wanna go

The school bell rings, what I've been waiting for
And you just spring and run for the door
Hey, it's summer mom, hey, it's summer dad
Man, it's been so long since the children had
A good time

Hey, maybe it all probably takes it's toll?
Hey, but didn't I make honor roll?
Either way eat your words, it's our time we deserve
Oh, to have a good time

Take me, far away, anywhere
As long as it's fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun, I wanna go

No more teachers and principals
A good behavior is sensible
Let's do everything till the summer's done
It's the greatest time for a soda, yum
And have a good time

Hey, maybe it all probably takes its toll?
Hey, but didn't I make honor roll?
Either way, eat your words, its our time, we deserve
Oh, to have a good time

Take me, far away, anywhere
As long as it's fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun, I wanna go

No more homework or PTA
No more lunch food as toxic waste
Let's get Mickey D's as a matter of fact
Lets get happy meals, want a sundae, man?
What a good time

Hey, maybe it all probably takes its toll
Hey, but didn't I make honor roll?
Either way, eat your words, it's our time, we deserve
Oh, to have a good time---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
