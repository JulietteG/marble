Please just forget me
Never let me into your heart
Cause the one thing I am all for of
Is falling out of love
Please Ill forget you
Never let you into my heart
I left you sanding, standing in the dark
Its all falling apart
Stay away Im not myself
No one can help me now
Ive lived for the devil
With a head full of devilish things
It only was because
Cause I was so afraid
Of falling out of love
Stay away Im not myself
No one can help me now
Ive lost my way
dont follow me
Ive lost my way---Lyrics submitted by Brooke.
