Goodbye palm trees,
Goodbye ocean,
Goodbye city;
I'm now in motion.

The morning air is cool.
I'll be in a pool of humidity.
Close your eyes and breathe in.
Once more; then begin.

Two hundred and seventy-five days left
Counting down to your death.
What are numbers? Values assigned
So we can understand.

Why count down?
Why count up?
The end will come,
And then what?---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
