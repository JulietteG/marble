Gonna put my pink dress on
And do my hair up tight
I'm gonna put some eyeliner on
I'm gonna look real nice
I'm going down to the church
On 4th & vine
I'm gonna marry my love
And we'll be happy for all time
Yeah, he's the sweetest man you could find
So gentle and so kind
And he's got those big green eyes
I can't believe me luck, he's mine
Not that he's no wuss
Girls, you know his love is serious
So warm inside
When he takes me for a buggy ride
When he takes me for a buggy ride
I will, I will, I will, I will
I do, I do, I do, I do

Gonna put my pink dress on
And do my hair up tight
I'm gonna put some eyeshadow on
It's gonna look real nice
I'm going down to the church
On 4th & vine
I'm gonna marry my love
And we'll be happy for all time
We're gonna have six children
And enough love for them
That they'll be happy all the time
I won't believe me luck, they're mine
They'll sing all day
They'll sing all night
Because their mama and their pa
A-love them so right
I will, I will, I will, I will
I do, I do, I do, I do

Gonna put my pink dress on
And do my hair up tight
I'm gonna put some perfume on
It's gonna smell real nice
I'm going down to the church
On 4th & vine
I'm gonna marry my love
And we'll be happy for all time
Yeah, he's the sweetest man you could find
So gentle and so kind
And he's got those big green eyes
I can't believe me luck, he's mine
Not that he's no wuss
Girls, you know his love is serious
So warm inside
When he takes me for a buggy ride
When he takes me for a buggy ride---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
