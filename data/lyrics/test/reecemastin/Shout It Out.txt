So what, you say you've got no money
But the kind of classy girls that you pull in's kinda funny
We're living it up, we're pushing our luck all day and night
Sticking bottles in the sand, making out in the cabanas
Bikinis in the surf, picture perfect all around us
We're laughing it up, we're running amok, no care in sight

Hot damn
No, I can only stop and stare
You're messing with my mind - I don't care
Girl, I can't get enough
Give me what you got if you dare

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got my top down
My girl's still stunning
She's been running through my mind all day
I just wanna scream out 
It's the middle of the summer
And baby, rock 'n' roll is here to stay
I just wanna shout it out from the rooftops, honey
Wanna shout it out all night
I just wanna shout it out, shout it out, shout it out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Shout it out, shout it out, shout it out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

So take a shot if you're feeling kinda heavy
Hit the sun with your shades and take a ride in my Chevy
We're tearing it up, we're feeling a rush, no turning 'round
So, baby, hold on tight, gonna rev it up
Living life on the edge ain't dangerous
We're living it up, we're pushing our luck all day and night

Hot damn
No, I can only stop and stare
You're messing with my mind - I don't care
Girl, I can't get enough
Give me what you got if you dare

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got my top down
My girl's still stunning
She's been running through my mind all day
I just wanna scream out 
It's the middle of the summer
And baby, rock 'n' roll is here to stay
I just wanna shout it out from the rooftops, honey
Wanna shout it out all night
I just wanna shout it out, shout it out, shout it out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Shout it out, shout it out, shout it out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Slow it down just a little bit
Bring the roof down just for the hell of it
Bounce with the bass and pop with the snare
Live it up tonight like we just don't care
Slow it down just a little bit
Bring the roof down just for the hell of it
Bounce with the bass and pop with the snare
Live it up tonight like we just don't care 
(Just don't care) 

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got my top down
My girl's still stunning
She's been running through my mind all day
I just wanna scream out 
It's the middle of the summer
And baby, rock 'n' roll is here to stay
I just wanna shout it out from the rooftops, honey
Wanna shout it out all night
I just wanna shout it out, shout it out, shout it out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Shout it out, shout it out, shout it out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

I just wanna shout it out from the rooftops, honey
Wanna shout it out all night
I just wanna shout it out, shout it out, shout it out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Shout it out, shout it out, shout it out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Shout it out, shout it out, shout it out
Whoa, oh, oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by Jess.
