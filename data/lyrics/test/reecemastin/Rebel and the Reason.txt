You arise with the sun like an enemy
By my side with a smile like there's nothing wrong
(There ain't nothing wrong, no-oh)
(There ain't nothing wrong, no-oh)

We're arrived at the place we all go
Talk to me like I don't, I don't know
(There ain't nothing wrong, no-oh)
(There ain't nothing wrong, no-oh)

Shut out the madness
Shut out the lies
Shut out the madness

I don't feel what you're feeling
Rock my heart to sleep
Is this what you want (Yeah, yeah)
I can't do what you want (Yeah, yeah)

And I feel like the rebel and the reason
Last tracks dieing you know
I can't do what you want (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I can't do what you want (Yeah, yeah)
And I just keep moving

You were right with song and the melody
Telling me with a smile that there's nothing wrong
(There ain't nothing wrong, no-oh)
Yeah
(There ain't nothing wrong, no-oh)

Takes these words, these lights they're drowning me
Little whispers in my mind saying it's all wrong
(There ain't nothing wrong, no-oh)
It's all wrong
(There ain't nothing wrong, no-oh)

Shut out the madness
Shut out the lies
Shut out the madness

I don't feel what you're feeling
Rock my heart to sleep
Is that's what you want (Yeah, yeah)
I can't do what you want (Yeah, yeah)

And I feel like the rebel and the reason
Last tracks dieing you know
I can't do what you want (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I can't do what you want (Yeah, yeah)
And I just keep moving

Remember when you said to me
That I would be your everything
But now you said that I
Never meant anything

'Cause all I ever wanted was
to make you smile
and all you ever wanted was to
make me feel so wrong

So damn wrong, yeah

I don't feel what you're feeling
Rock my heart to sleep
Is this what you want
I can't do what you want

Oh

And I feel like the rebel and the reason
Last tracks dieing you know
I can't do what you want (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I can't do what you want (Yeah, yeah)

And I just keep moving (Yeah, yeah)
And I just keep moving (Yeah, yeah)
No-oh
I just keep moving---
