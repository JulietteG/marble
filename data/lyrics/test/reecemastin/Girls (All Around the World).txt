I pack my bags
For an endless summer
And Im not lookin back
Dont care whats comin my way
This is the first time in my life
I feel alive

Got lost in London
Kiss in Paris
Brooklyn broke my heart
Went down to Sydney she's the loudest
But Bristol parties hard
Got a job in Jordan to get to China
While India tied me down
There all amazing
And you find them
All around the world

Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world

If these walls could talk
Boy Id have a story to tell
My door aint locked
So just keep ringing my bell
If you see Cali tell here why
I had to fly

Got lost in London
Kiss in Paris
Brooklyn broke my heart
Went down to Sydney shes the loudest
But Bristol parties hard
Got a job in Jordan to get to China
While India tied me down
There all amazing
And you find them
All around the world

Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world

Ive been everywhere
From Pompeii to Berlin
Ive see it all but nothing else compares
I swear

Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world

Got lost in London
Kiss in Paris
All around the world
Went down to Sydney shes the loudest
All around the world
Got a job in Jordan to get to China
All around the world
There all amazing and you find them
All around the world

Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls, girls
All around the world---
