Out in the crowd, it's the middle of the night
Everybody's looking at you
Familiar faces but nothing seems to phase me
It's all about me and you
yeah, the night is still young
We gotta have some fun
we'll leave it all behind now
I'm not saying I'm mister right
But leave without a fight
I gotta make a move somehow

Cause I don't wanna waste tonight
Let's turn out all the lights now 
Make out on your bedroom floor
No I don't wanna say good bye
Wishing for the spot light
Missing on your bedroom floor

So shut up and kiss me
No need to tease me
You don't need to say no more
Shut up and kiss me
I know you're gonna miss me
Kissing on your bedroom floor

So what you think are we on the same page
Cause I don't wanna play the same game
So Roll a dice we don't need to think twice
You're gonna beat me every time we play

yeah, the night is still young
We gotta have some fun
we'll leave it all behind now
I'm not saying I'm mister right
But leave without a fight
I gotta make a move somehow

Cause I don't wanna waste tonight
Let's turn out all the lights now 
Make out on your bedroom floor
No I don't wanna say good bye
Wishing for the spot light
Missing on your bedroom floor

So shut up and kiss me
No need to tease me
You don't need to say no more
Shut up and kiss me
I know you're gonna miss me
Kissing on your bedroom floor

Let's save the best for the darkness
Give me just a little bit more
Don't say that you can't resist me
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Cause I don't wanna waste tonight
Let's turn out all the lights now 
Make out on your bedroom floor
No I don't wanna say good bye
Wishing for the spot light
Missing on your bedroom floor

Cause I don't wanna waste tonight
Let's turn out all the lights now 
Make out on your bedroom floor
No I don't wanna say good bye
Wishing for the spot light
Missing on your bedroom floor

So shut up and kiss me
No need to tease me
You don't need to say no more
Shut up and kiss me
I know you're gonna miss me
Kissing on your bedroom floor

Shut up and kiss me
No need to tease me
You don't need to say no more
Shut up and kiss me
I know you're gonna miss me
Kissing on your bedroom floor ---
