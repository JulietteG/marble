i'm so tired of falling in love, finding it easier to fall out
i can't deny it
i feel it inside, oh, cupid's fire
oh you can't hide

{chourse}
i'm falling in love again, a'int nothing i can do
falling in love with u and this time is with you
when i fall, it's always the same
and i'm so tired of playing this game again, oh

it's been so long now since i gave up my heart
i've kept it locked down, i don't wanna get it harmed
so let me tell u now, i just wanna be sure
that u won't hurt me, oh, can u promise me that?

{chourse}

u got to tell me if u gonna break my heart 
'cause i dont wanna take a chance
and if it ai'nt true
all it's gonna be is nothing but a poor romance

so give me that promise to hold on
and i'll never let u go
i got to have somthing to go on
i'm letting u know

{chourse}

fall in love again (i'm falling now', i'm falling)
fall in love again (girl u got me, yeah, u got me,oh)

fall in love again (oh i'm falling now)
fall in love again (incomprehensible)

fall in love again 
fall in love again 
i'm fall in love again 
i'm fall in love again---Lyrics submitted by miri.
