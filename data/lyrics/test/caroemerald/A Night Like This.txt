From where you are, You see the smoke start to arise, 
Where they play cards
And you walk over softly moving passed the guards.
The stakes are getting higher,
You can feel it in your heart.
He calls you bluff.

He is the ace you never thought he played that much
And now it's more than all this cards you want to touch,
You never know if winning this could really be enough.
Take a look, beyond the moon you see the stars.
And when you look around, you know the room by heart.

I have never dreamed it.
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it.
I may never see a night like this.
When everything you think is incomplete.
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek.
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this.

How many times, have I been waiting by the door to hear these chimes?
To hear that some one debonaire has just arrived.
And opened up to see my world before my eyes.

That silhouette creates an image on the night I can't forget.
It has the scent of something special, I can't rest.
If I resist temptation, oh I Know for sure that I will lose the bet.
I walk away and suddenly it seems I'm not alone.
In front of me he stands - I stop, before he goes.

I have never dreamed it.
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it.
I may never see a night like this.
When everything you think is incomplete.
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek.
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this.

[Music]


I have never dreamed it.
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it.
I may never see a night like this.
When everything you think is incomplete.
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek.
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this.---Lyrics submitted by Peter.
