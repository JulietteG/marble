Oh Lord, I'm a very sharp sword
Number one upon the billboard
It's the effect you don't expect
You never know what's coming next
So get a grip quick drop a gear running high to the sky
Can you fly?
Like a killer in Manila
I make you shiver
My name is MC I

Baby
I don't want you to go
I love you so
More than you will ever know
Lately
I only made you cry
But don't you say good bye
Won't you give me one more try
'Cause I'm lonely
I feel so lonely
I need your body by my side
To get me through there endless nights
I'm lonely
I feel so lonely
There's no one in this world for me but you

Alright
Yeah

Pull 'em up

Oh Lord, every time we cut the slack
Always forward never ever going back
We're playing full session, full swing
Got the sounds of the real thing
So get a grip quick drop a gear we progress and express
We're coming fresh
The appliance of the science
We getting strong, oh yes
And we're dressed for success

Lately
I only made you cry
But don't you say good bye
Won't you give me one more try
'Cause I'm lonely
I feel so lonely
I need your body by my side
To get me through there endless nights
I'm lonely
I feel so lonely
There's no one in this world for me but you

Keep it up now

Come on

Pull 'em up, pull 'em up---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
