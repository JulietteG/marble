Walking in the rain far away from nowhere.
No more noise, just silence and the music that's in my brain.
Walking through the night, a different atmosphere.
No more noise, just silence and the sound that's in my ear.

I'm just dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.

Walking down the hill listening to the trees.
No more noise, just silence and the raindrops on my shoes.
Walking down the beach sparkling lights on the water.
No more noise, just silence and by the way I'm feeling free.

I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.

I'm just dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.
I'm dancing, dancing in the moonlight.---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
