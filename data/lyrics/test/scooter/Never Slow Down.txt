Hard like wax going up to the max
Starting up those lirycs on our radical tracks
Put on your headphones when I'm expressing lirycal
Like no other mc my concept is a miracle
When I've got the microphone I don't like the slow mo
You know my flow is better than a porno in soho
All I recommend is to be in the place
When we start jammin' up and rockin'to your face

Never slow down (8)

Fresh on the mic you got it tonight
We're still on the mix and we've won the fight
Here is the lyrical assault and I call it rough
Is someone's gonna blame us enough is enough
Tried of the bussines sick if all the fake hellos
People run around and while they look like marshmellows
We continue our work and we don't want repeats
'couse we know our crowd is still addicted to our bass

Never slow down (8)---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
