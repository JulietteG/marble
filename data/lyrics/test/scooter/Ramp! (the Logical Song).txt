When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, they liked to sing so happily
So joyfully, oh playfully watching me

Good morning!
Yeahhh 
One, two... one, two, three, four!
Pump it up!
Ahahahah

RMB no me no skip me fame, yeah!
With me jam for the microphone, and busy with the DJ
Jungless in the place
Jungless on the case
Scooter, are you ready?

When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful, 
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, they liked to sing so happily
So joyfully, oh playfully watching me

When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful, 
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, they liked to sing so happily 
So joyfully, oh playfully watching me

Yeah!

When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful, 
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, they liked to sing so happily
So joyfully, oh playfully watching me

When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful, 
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, they liked to sing so happily 
So joyfully, oh playfully watching me

Come on!

Love, peace, and unity
Siberia, the place to be!
The K, the L, the F and anthology
Hallelujah!
One, two....one, two, three, yeah!
Rough!
Aaahaaaha
Here we go!

When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful, 
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, they liked to sing so happily 
So joyfully, oh playfully watching me

Stand up!

Once again!

We're gettin' jiggy!

Siberiaaaaa!

Yeah!

Goodbye!---Lyrics submitted by bob.
