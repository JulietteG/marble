Coming up strong with the microphone
This is the Spirit that turns me on
Radical rhythms you've never known
One, two, one two three four

The cool crew is back
Here is the next attack
We like to go that way
We don't care what they say
So come on get it now
I wanna shout it out
Time will never stop
So let's start it up
We don't let you down
I wanna go for
We don't let you down
I wanna go for
Lets go, turn around
Don't want it no more
We don't let you down

Don't gimme the funk
Yeah
Come on
Party!
Yes

We know we are respected
All the things expected
We don't care about
Just play it loud
We don't let you down
I wanna go for
We don't let you down
I wanna go for
Lets go, turn around
Don't want it no more
We don't let you down

Don't gimme the funk
Yeah
Don't gimme the funk
Yes

Everybody start walking in the air
And throw your hands in the atmosphere
I'm gonna grab the mic for your delight
So let's go out for the night

Keep it up
Alright Now
Yeah
Come on---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
