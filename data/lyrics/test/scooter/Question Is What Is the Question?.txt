How do you do
Uh huh
I thought why not
Na na
Na na
Just me and you

Start the danger
Rearranger
Not so cool
Mercy
I`m the vapour
On the radar
Get up on the mic and shout it
Yah
Move it
I spit bricks got the kicks in the mix
My pricks long out the rigs
Party of bricks like Jackie X
No diggedy diggedy HP
I`m the bad boy, roll MC, so sexy

How do you do
Uh huh
I thought why not
Na na
Na na
Just me and you and then we can
Na na
Na na
Just like before and you will say
Na na
Na na
Please give me more and you
How do you do
Uh huh
I thought why not
Na na
Na na
Just me and you and then we can
Na na
Na na
Just like before and you will say
Na na
Na na
Please give me more and you
How do you do
Uh huh
I thought why not
Na na

Just me and you and then we can
Na na
Na na
Just like before and you will say
Na na
Na na
Please give me more and you
Yes

Jump that beat
Jump that beat

Wont let you go
Me got the flow
Mash up the show
Shalak
K nami nama
Like a hammer
A burning candle
Fixed up with the spanner
Move it
I slip chips
Rapping in da mix
Wanna see your tits
Spit, kicks
For da hits
With the lyrical tricks
No diggedy diggedy diggedy, listen
Got a late night - early morning mission

How do you do
Uh huh
I thought why not
Na na
Na na
Just me and you and then we can
Na na
Na na
Just like before and you will say
Na na

Jump that beat

Wonderful bars fat like Michaels arse!
This is an announcement: Please refrain from not smoking
The question is
Hi there
What is the question?
Yeah
Here we go
Alright
Big up the crew

How do you do
Uh huh
