Weary traveler, calloused and sore
Time and gravity followed you here
Rest, my sister, and tell me
All about the ocean

I've never seen the ocean
Not like this one

Weary traveler, calloused and sore
Time and gravity followed you here
Rest, my brother, and tell me
All about the ocean

Spoils and trophies and burdens you've bore.
Pay them no mind, they matter no more
Leave them behind and show me
All about the ocean

Look in your eyes
I've never seen the ocean
Not like this one

Deep in your eyes
I've never seen the ocean
Not like this one

Show me your eyes
I've never seen the ocean
Not like this one

Look in your eyes
I've never seen the ocean
Not like this one---Lyrics submitted by Kenna Hale.
