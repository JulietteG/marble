I don't know, but it's been said,
"You do or don't, and then you're dead."
So climb away, get higher son.
Never stray, just move ahead.

Never one to hog the grass,
Sniff the dope and act an ass,
Just a soldier marching to
The golden rule of puff and pass.

So pardon me, I'm wrappin' up.
If I was speakin out of class,
I'm just a grunt who's groovin' to
The golden rule of puff and pass.

I don't know, but it's been said,
"You do or don't, and then you're dead."
So climb I will, or crawl around.
Never stray just move ahead.

Left, right, left. Hooah!

I don't know but it's been said,
"We'll rest forever when we're dead."
I don't know but it's been said,
"We'll rest forever when we're dead."

Hup, hup, hup.

I don't know but it's been said,
"We'll last forever when we're dead."
I don't know but it's been said,
"We'll rest forever when we're dead."

I don't know but it's been said,
"We'll last forever when we're dead."
I don't know but it's been said,
"We'll rest forever when we're dead."

We'll rest forever when we're dead---Lyrics submitted by Jay.
