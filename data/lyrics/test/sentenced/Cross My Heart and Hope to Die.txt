Since your death
everything has felt so meaningless and vain
that ive lost the will to live
Love, your death
ripped my heart right out and since you went away
lifes had nothing more to give
Cross my heart and hope to die
may my end come tonight
across the dark, into the light
may death again us unite
Love, my fate
will you wait for me there...where our autumn dawns?
there, beyond the dreary seas
Will you wait?
will you welcome me into your arms once more?
where our waters still fall free
Cross my heart and hope to die
may my end come tonight
across the dark, into the light
may death again us unite
Cross my heart and hope to die
may my end come tonight
ill depart from this life
may death again us unite
May it come...
My heart went down with you
at your funeral i was buried, too
my life - it ended with yours
and i...exist no more---Lyrics submitted by Deyy.
