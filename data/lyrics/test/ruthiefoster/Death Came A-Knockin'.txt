Oh you know that
Oh you know that

You know that death came a-knockin' on my mother's door
Singin' "Come on, mother, ain't ya ready to go?"
And my mother stooped down, buckled up her shoes
And she moved on down by the Jordan stream.
And then she shout
"Hallelujah! Done, done my duty!
Got on my travelin' shoes".

Death came a-knockin' on my sister's door
Singin' "Come on, sister, ain't ya ready to go?"
And my sister stooped down, buckled up her shoes
And she moved on down by the Jordan stream.
And then she shout
"Hallelujah! Done, done my duty!
Got on my travelin' shoes".

Hey hey,
Hey hey

You know that death came a-knockin' on my brother's door
Singin' "Come on, brother, ain't ya ready to go?"
And my brother stooped down, buckled up his shoes
And he moved on down by the Jordan stream.

"Hallelujah! Done, done my duty!
Got on my travelin' shoes".

You know when death came a-knockin' on my neighbours door
Singin' "Come on, neighbour, ain't ya ready to go?"
And my neighbour stooped down, buckled up his shoes
And he moved on down by the Jordan stream.
And then he shout
"Hallelujah! Done, done my duty!
Got on my travelin' shoes".

Hey hey,

You know that death came a-knockin' on my preachers door
Singin' "Come on, preacher, ain't ya ready to go?"
And my preacher stooped down, buckled up his shoes
And he moved on down by the Jordan stream.
And then he shout
"Hallelujah! Done, done my duty!
Got on my travelin' shoes".

You know when death comes a-knockin' on my front door,
Singin' "Come on, sister, ain't ya ready to go?"
And then I'll stoop right down, buckle up my shoes
And I'll move on down by the Jordan stream.
And then I'll shout
"Hallelujah! Done, done my duty!
Got on my travelin' shoes". ---
