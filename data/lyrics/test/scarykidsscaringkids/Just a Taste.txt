forgive and forget
it's just a memory 
it won't get me very far this time
is what I've done to you unforgivable?

silence fills the room and i get the message
emptiness is all that's left this time
is what i meant to you, that forgettable?

better than, better than me of course
you're always right
you're always on the ball

better than, better than everything I've done for you,
cause now you can finally sleep
can you smile too?

i took it as a threat
you meant it as the doctrine of everything that was and would become

i don't have to ask, you don't miss me at all
you made it obvious, when you slowly walked away

and then i prayed in vain
i would've traded everything, even for just a taste

i'll live with the loneliness, but I'll never forget
i was never your best bet

better than, better than me of course
you're always tight 
you're always on the ball

better than, better than everything I've done for you 
cause you can finally sleep
can you smile too?

now you can sleep, can you smile too?
can you smile now that I'm gone?---Lyrics submitted by alex.
