Let me up
Let me out
I am suffocating
I can't live without
This all behind me
Is this almost over now?

the longest night my darkest hour
Where you will find me
Pale, lost, and dying
From the truth

You left me at the altar
My heart in my hand
I am tired and broken
Haunted by memories of
The life you've stolen
I am tired and broken

You left me at the altar
My heart in my hand
(YOU LEFT ME!)
In my hand...
(YOU LEFT ME!)
(AND I WON'T FORGET!)

Let me out, let me out
Lips are trembling as i cannot make a sound
my love betrays me
Is this almost over now?
the walls caved in, the roof fell down
And I am finally
Tired of the lying
And the cloud that follows you...

You left me at the altar
My heart in my hand
I am tired and broken
Haunted by memories of
The life you've stolen

I am tired and broken
You left me at the altar
My heart in my hand
(YOU LEFT ME!)
(AND I WON'T FORGET!)
In my hand...
(YOU LEFT ME WITH MY HEART.. IN.. MY.. HAND!)
(I WON'T FORGET!)

You left me breathless
You left me scared
But your arms have never kept me warm
WHEN YOU WERE HERE!

And now my only hope is to take back what you've stolen
My life will go on without you...
And now my only hope is to take back what you've stolen
MY LIFE WILL GO ON WITHOUT YOU!

You left me at the altar
My heart in my hand
I am tired and broken
Haunted by memories of
The life you've stolen
You've stolen...
You've stolen...
(You left me in the end)
You've stolen...
(I WILL NOT FORGET!)---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
