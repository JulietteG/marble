He sees what's beneath her skin he sees through her soul.
Blue eyes and empty veins her fortune unfolds.
She steps out of her body that lies on the floor.

Rise, rise from the ashes. Sink teeth into her, she become the cure.
Blood runs forever. Blood runs forever.

Full moon illuminates the streets breathing fire, the dead come
together to drink their desires. They march down the allies. The devils parade.
More of the turbulence that causes disaster.
More of the chaos erasing the borders.
More than Confusion and all that she fears.
The dark side is coming the dark side is...

Rise, rise from the ashes. Sink teeth into her, she becomes the cure. Blood runs forever... Blood runs forever...

She's giving it all away, she's all the way there. she's giving it al, she is prepared, to take her place to fall in line, she steps into the door tonight.

Rise, rise from the ashes. Sink teeth into her, she becomes the cure. Blood runs forever. Blood runs forever

Rise, rise from the ashes. Sink teeth into her, she becomes the cure. Blood runs forever. Blood runs forever. Blood runs forever. Blood runs forever. Blood runs forever...---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
