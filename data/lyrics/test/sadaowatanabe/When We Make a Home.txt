(A lovely home.....ooh....)
When we make a home
When our love has grown
When all our apprehensions fade
And we can say "forever"
When we share our dreams
Everything we own
We'll build a life together
When we make a home

Safe and warm (Safe and warm)
We're sheltered from the storm
(So we'll happy together)
When we make a home together
Love will last forever
Now our love is young
Facing the unknown (Forever more...)
But we'll find joy together
When we make a home

(A lovely home.....ooh....)
When our hearts are one
Though our minds are two
When we can cherish everyday
And fill our lives with laughter
We will dance and sing
In the setting sun
We've made a home together
When our hearts are one (* twice)---Lyrics submitted by Fanny.
