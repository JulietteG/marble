We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there in the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know...

There I was Romeo, I was throwing pebbles
And your daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please don't go
'Cause you belong with me

If you could see
That I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

So glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while

You've been good, busier than ever
Small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night"
I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December all the time

Someday, Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Oh, someday, Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Why you gotta be so mean
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

We are never ever ever getting back together
(This love is ours)
We are never ever ever getting back together
(This love is ours)

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(We are never getting back together)
Shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been

I'm feeling 22

Losing her was blue like I'd never known
Missing her was dark grey all along
Forgetting her is like trying to know somebody you never met
Loving her was red, so red...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
