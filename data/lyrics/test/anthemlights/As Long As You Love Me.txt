As long as you love me,
As long as you love me,
As long as you love me.

Were under pressure,
Seven billion people in the wold try to fit in,
Keep it together,
Smile on your face even know your heart is frowning.

But hey now,
You know girl,
We both know its a cruel world,
But I will take my chances.

As long as you love me,
We could be starving,
We could be homeless,
We could be broke.

As long as you love me,
Ill be your platinum
Ill be your silver,
Ill be your gold.

As long as you love, love, love, love me ,
As long as you love, love, love, love me. 

Ill be your soldier,
Fighting every second of the day,
For your dreams girl,
Ill be your hova,
You can be my Destinys Child,
On the scene girl.

 Dont stress,
Dont cry,
We dont need no wings to fly,
Just take my hand.

As long as you love me,
We could be starving,
We could be homeless,
We could be broke.

As long as you love me,
Ill be your platinum,
Ill be your silver,
Ill be your gold.

As long as you love, love, love, love me ,
As long as you love, love, love, love me. 

Uh,

I can make you fly,
Give you some wings,
Thats the product of a man,
And what true love can bring.

If we rich then,
We can see the finer side of dreams,
But if we broke then I dont care,
Im good at fixing things.

And it dont matter if,
We gotta love each other,
Through the good and crazy.

You and me against the whole world,
And the fact of the matter is,
Thats what thats what makes me,
Want you so much more then breath,
So where this next one take me,
Is right back to your arms where I know im save.

We can hold each other,
Til the end of the world comes crashing,
And we like a movie you direct me to a better end,
You like my inspiration,
Mo-mo motivation,
You stole my heart and i dont need replacing.

As long as you love me.

We could be starving,
We could be homeless,
We could be broke.

As long as you love me,
Ill be your platinum,
Ill be your silver,
Ill be your gold.

As long as you love, love, love, love me,
As long as you love, love, love, love me,
As long as you love, love, love, love me,
As long as you love, love, love, love me,
As long as you love, love, love, love me.

As long as you love me.
Ill be your silver,
Ill be your gold.---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
