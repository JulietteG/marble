Im at a payphone
I threw a wish in the well
Dont ask me, Ill never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now youre in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now youre in my way

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now Im paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

Im at a payphone
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But heres my number
So call me, maybe?
Its hard to look right
At you baaaaby
Heres my number

Im at a payphone trying to call home
All of my changes I spent on you
Where have the time gone,
Baby its all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist (Im wide awake)
I would still be holding you like this (Im wide awake)
All those fairy tales are full of it (Im wide awake)
One more stupid love song Ill be sick

Yeah, falling from cloud 9
(it was out of the blue Im)
Crashing from the high (I wish I knew then)
Letting go tonight (what I know now wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down)
Falling from cloud 9
Star-ships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Lets do this one last time
Lets do this one more time
One more time, one more time
One more time

Tonight
We are young
So lets set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

Tonight
We are young
So lets set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight

Call me maybe at a payphone
Wide awake and standing on
A star-ship waiting while
Were young tonight! ---
