We can't shut up....
We can't shut up....
We can't shut up....

I had a heartbeat
I was breathing
And I kept going and going
Without a reason
I was livin
Just to be livin
Until he really gave me life

This much I know
I am not alone
And I know I'm not the only one 
Who's found the way home
Its not a secret
Don't have to keep it deep in side

Hey, hey are ya there?
We've been lookin for ya
Hey, hey are ya there?
We've been searching for ya
Hey, hey are ya there?
If your love is your song
Pass it on!

This is what we get up and sing
(We can't shut up)
We've got everything that we need
(We can't shut up)
Love is coming
Now we're free
We can't shut up about it
We can't shut up about it
(We can't shut up)

We've had a problem
But ain't calling Houston
You and I can solve it
We've gotta break the silence
We've been quiet for too long
We gotta wake up, wake up
Hey!

Hey, hey are ya there?
We've been lookin for ya
Hey, hey are ya there?
We've been searchin for ya
Hey, hey are ya there?
Let the lost and found
Let it out!

This is what we get up and sing
(We can't shut up)
We've got everything that we need
(We can't shut up)
Love is coming 
Now we are free
We can't shut up about it
We can't shut up about it
(We can't shut up!)

This is what we get up and sing
(We can't shut up!)
He is everything that we need
(We can't shut up!)
Love is coming
Now we are free
We can't shut up about it
We can't shut up about it
(We can't shut up....)

Out of the darkness
And into the light
When the blind man can see
Its a beautiful sight
Out of the darkness
And into the light
When the blind man can see
Its a beautiful sight.....

This is what we get up and sing
(We can't shut up!)
We got everything that we need
(We can't shut up!)
Love is coming
Now we are free
We can't shut up about it
We can't shut up about it
WE CAN'T SHUT UP!

This is what we get up and sing
(We can't shut up!)
He is everything that we need
(We can't shut up!)
Love is coming 
Now we are free
We can't shut up about it
We can't shut up about it

We can't shut up!...
(We can't shut up!...)
We can't shut up!...
(We can't shut up!...)
We can't shut up!...
(We can't shut up!...)
We can't shut up!...
(We can't shut up about it!...)

WE CAN'T SHUT UP!...

(Out of the darkness 
And into the light
When the blind man can see
Its a beautiful sight...)
(Out of the darkness
And into the light
When the blind man can see
Its a beautiful sight.....)---
