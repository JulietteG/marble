[Lil' Wayne]
Uh
I like a long haired thick red bone
Open up her legs then filet mignon that pussy
I'm a get in and on that pussy
If she let me in I'm a own that pussy
Go'n throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick
Now come here let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend
Your friends should call you dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
Huh
But you can come and tunecha
I'll fuck the whole group
Baby I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid
My head is the dumbest
I promise
I should be hooked on phonics
Yea

But anyway I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful
I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it
And watch you
(Back it up and dump it back
Back it up and dump it back)

[Chorus:]
Cause we like her
And we like her too
And we like her
And we like her too
And we like her
And we like her too
And we like herr
And she like us too
Ohhhhhh

I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Ohhhhhh

[Drake:]
Yea
Alright
(Ohh ohhh)
She be jumpin up and down
Tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour
Just to get that belt to fasten
All they want to talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin'
Them all
Young Money man this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded so please bring your finest
And what are all your names again we drunk remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am lets be honest

She wants me she wants me
Cause I got it all shawty tell me what you don't see
I will fuck wit all y'all
All of y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say pussy pussy pussy
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn
And every time I think of staying wit her
She bring that friend around that make a nigga reconsider

[Chorus]

[Jae Millz:]
I ain't being disrespectful baby I'm just being Millz
And I don't know how fake feels so I gotta keep it real
I just wanna fuck every girl in the world
Every model every singer every actress every diva
Every high sadiddy chick every college girl every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble eva
My role model is will
So married woman or milf
It don't matter who you is miss
You can get the business
Haaaa

[Gudda Gudda:]
These hoes is gods gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin long hair thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log
And I'm a call all of y'all
My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out "papi" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can ride 'em too boy I gets my pimpin' on

[Chorus]

[Mack Maine:]
And bitch I'm Mack Maine -aine -aine -aine
Sanaa Lathan
Megan Good

D Woods
For free suites I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no not at all
Kit kat a midget if that ass soft I break her off
I exchange V cards with the retards
And get behind the Christian like Dior cause he are
Mack Mizzo
Baby
Cause he arrre Mack Mizzo
Babyyyyy

And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
