[Jae Millz:]
Sittin on the toilet, smokin on sum medicated
Countin loose thousands I'm living good dey aggrivated
Two things on my mind one is to keep stylin
N tha second is to keep gettin more of this shit I'm countin
Call me j20 I flow like a fountain
N I swear I beat da beat up til dat bitch start ouchin
Keep them bitches asses bouncin
Be flyer like a falcon
Comparin them to I is like a pebble to a mountain
I'm a uptown flame thrower young money fire starter
I had to sign to Wayne I'm from the same place as the carter
Harlem
N I ain't like none of these otha niggas
I get it I spend it yo husband on a budget misses
Young money cloud gang we so above you niggas
Besides these groupies after these shows who fuckin with us?
You might as well have a badge the way you cuff dem bitches
I slut dem bitches n back to the dough like fuck dem bitches

[Lil Wayne:]
Times ain't the same
Shit done gone bad
But nigga we good
Nigga we good den a ma fucka

So fuck dem niggas n fuck dem hoes

[Gudda Gudda:]
Ok it's too much paper, n not enough hands to count it
Paper coming in money never going outward,
It's young money yea I here alotta niggas doubtin
This here is gods work ain't nothing you can do about it
So nigga join the team or you can catch the side line
Or just get out the game or get hit from the blind side
We makin money while you niggas makin petty quotes
You can make it rain we make it flood like the levy broke
It's all about the paper money controls my where-abouts
About a year from now I'm tryna break dat new mclaren out
Wheels of fortune on the whip phantom white in it
Bitch shotgun prolly be ya wife in it
Hustle year round nothin come n front of dat
Rap real estate n work I can make a ton with dat
Pay me in advance I'm not comin bitch
Like pain Wayne n Mack Maine I got money bitch

[Lil Wayne:]
Times ain't the same
Shit done gone bad
But nigga we good
Nigga we good den a ma fucka
Den a ma fucka

So fuck dem niggas n fuck dem hoes
Money talks

[Mack Maine:]
Bitch I'm Mack Maine!
Young money underboss
U don't wanna come a cross
Money doin summer saults
Bentley on young adults
Stuntin on dem hoes it ain't me it's the money fault
Still make it rain get struck by a money bolt
What it is doe?
I know what it ain't
Ya'll go hard
I go to the bank
Check my check stubs
Bitch it's Mack Maine
Young money up n runnin
Join the campaign

[Lil Wayne:]
Times ain't the same
Shit done gone bad
Bend a bitch over pull sum money out her ass
I'm tired of the game
Cause it ain't wat it was
Dat chopper so close I can give dat bitch a hug
N a gangsta need love so I keep a gangsta bitch
I got dat dope dick derre ain't a bitch I can't addict
N I'm lookin at the game
I roll my eyes
I looked at the clock n her hands were tied
Bcuz the times ain't the same
Shit done gone bad
But nigga we good
Nigga we good den a ma fucka
Den a ma fucka
Dis for my ma fuckas
We run dis ma fucka
So fuck dem niggas n fuck dem hoes
Money talks
We say hello
N I'm soo
I'm soo
I'm soo
Young mula baby...---Lyrics submitted by kari.
