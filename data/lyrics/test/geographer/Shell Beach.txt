Down, down the road
Straight to the bottom of the ocean floor
We pack up every house
Took every family... we were getting out
And the waves, they are so strong
They move your perfect body and the perfect song
Oh tonight, the world is ours
Cause we don't need to want to know who we are

I am alive, but I am so cold
And if I stay here much longer I will stay for good
But for now, I feel so free
I'm feeling almost like it was all meant to be---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
