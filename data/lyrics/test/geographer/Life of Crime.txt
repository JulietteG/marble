You and me, we had  it all wrong
There was ice beneath our feet
But  I refuse to understand it
And I refuse not to believe 
I know that I'll be alone tonight, wishing you were by my side

So this life is not what you planned
If this is life at all, it's a life of crime.

Now it's true I'll ignore you
You will always look for me
But there is nothing here to hold on to except the possibilities

When I was young
I had a vision
I saw the waves crash into the sky
You said this life was made for the living
Well if this is life, at all, it's a life of crime---Lyrics submitted by Billy J.
