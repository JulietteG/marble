And I never thought I'd feel this way 
And as far as I'm concerned 
I'm glad i got the chance to say that I do believe i love you
And if  i should ever go away well then close your eyes and try to feel the way we do today
And then if u can remember

[Chorus]
Keep smiling, keep trying knowing u can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times i'll be on your side for ever more
That's what friends are for

Well you came and opened me
And now there's so much more 
I see
And so by the way, i thank you
And then for the times when we we're apart
Well the close your eyes and know 
These words are coming from my heart
And then if you can remember

[Chorus]
Keep smiling,keep shining knowing you cam always count on me for sure
That's what friend are for
In good times and bad times i'll be on your side for ever more
That's what friends are for
