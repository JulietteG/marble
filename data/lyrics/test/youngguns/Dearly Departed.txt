Oh, dust and bones
That I have left behind
Are monuments to those I used to know
At least I know where I am on my own

I wanna be the last thing that you see
Be my dearly departed
Back to when you were the only thing
I need
Before I gave up, my dearly departed
Gave up, my dearly departed

Your sticks and stones are all that I've ever known
I'm bruised but I'm not broken and I know
At least I know where I am on my own

I wanna be the last thing that you see
Be my dearly departed
Back to when you were the only thing
I need
Before I gave up, my dearly departed
Gave up, my dearly departed

None of the people who tried to could make me feel this way
I'll gladly do my time
I found you, unbound you, and tried to explain the only way, 
That I knew how to say

I wanna be the last thing that you see
Be my dearly departed
Back to when you were the only thing I need
I wanna be the last thing that you see
My dearly departed
I wanna be the last thing that you see
My dearly departed
I wanna be the last thing that you see
My dearly departed
I wanna be the last thing that you see
My dearly departed---Lyrics submitted by Josh Leveridge.
