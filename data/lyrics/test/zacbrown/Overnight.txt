I dont know how much more of this that I can take
I want you
And I aint gonna have you any other way

Aint no time for talking
Show me what you got
We gonna get this bed a rockin
It aint gonna stop
Aint no time for talkin
Show me what you got
We gonna get this bed a rockin
It aint gonna stop

Roll your body like you do
Dont be afraid to move it
You got everything I like
So why dont you get right to it
Come on let yourself go crazy
Come on, girl, amaze me
Im your judge and jury
So you gotta do the time

Overnight
Overnight
Overnight (youre getting locked up)
Overnight (like it or not)

First, Im gonna search your body over
Gotta make sure you aint hiding nothin nowhere

Aint no time for talking
Show me what you got
We gonna get this bed a rockin
It aint gonna stop
Aint no time for talkin
Show me what you got
We gonna get this bed a rockin
It aint gonna stop

Roll your body like you do
Dont be afraid to move it
You got everything I like
So why dont you get right to it
Come on let yourself go crazy
Come on, girl, amaze me
Im your judge and jury
So you gotta do the time

Overnight (youre getting locked up)
Overnight (like it or not, girl)
Overnight (youre getting locked up)
Overnight 

*Trombone Shorty solo*

Tell me how you want it
Tell me how you want it
Oh, wait
You better show me
You better show me
No time for talkin
Show me what you got
We gonna get this bed a rockin
It aint gonna stop

Overnight (getting locked up)
Overnight (like it or not, girl)
Overnight 
Overnight 
Overnight (overnight)
Overnight 
Overnight 
Overnight 
Im gonna Im gonna beat it up, girl---Lyrics submitted by David.
