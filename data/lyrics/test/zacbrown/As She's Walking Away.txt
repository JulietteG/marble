We never spoke a word 
But every thought she had I heard from across the room 
We were standing face to face 
I couldn't find the words to say give me one more move 
I don't even know her name 
I guess foolish prides to blame 

First Chrous: 
Now I'm fall'n in love as she's walking away 
and my heart won't tell my mind to tell my mouth what it should say 
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day 
Now I'm fall'n in love as she's walking away 

Wise man next to me did say 
bout the one that got away 
"son i missed my chance 
Don't you let regret take place 
of the dreams you have to chase 
ask her to dance.... go on son 
you might fall down on your face 

roll the dice and have some faith" 

Second Chorus: 
Don't be fall'n in love as she's walking away 
when your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say 
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day 
Don't be fall'n in love as she's walking away 

you might fall down on your face 
roll the dice and have some faith 

Third Chorus (and ending) 
Don't be fall'n in love as she's walking away 
when your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say 
May have lost this battle, live to fight another day 
Don't be fall'n..., fall'n... , fall in love.... as she's walking awaaaay---Lyrics submitted by Haven.
