(feat. Amos Lee)

Early morning in a motel room,
Sunshine trying to creep on through.
Lost Sleep but I found a tune,
Stuck inside my head.
Cigarettes, a tank of gas,
Headed off to nowhere fast,
Gotta find a way to make this feeling last.

Cause I believe that I,
Was born with a song inside of me.
Never question why,
I just keep on singing that melody.
And as time goes by,
Oh its funny how time can make you realize,
We're running out of it.

On the day that I die,
I wanna to say that I,
Was a man who really lived and never compromised.
I want to live out my days,
Until the very end,
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.

A part of dawn to be ashamed of,
But good people are supposed to be up.
But I found peace with the path I took,
As I lay down my head.
Crossroads you gotta choose,
Which way could be win or lose.
But every morning my soul seems to sing on through.

Cause I believe that I,
Was born with a song inside of me.
Never question why,
I just keep on singing these melodies.
And as time goes by,
Its funny how time can make you realize,
We're running out of it.

On the day that I die,
I wanna to say that I,
Was a man who really lived and never compromised.
I want to live out my days,
Until the very end,
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.

Woo a woooo
Woo a woooo

Its funny how time can make you realize,
We're running out of it.

On the day that I die,
I wanna to say that I,
Was a man who really loved and never compromised.
I want to live out my days,
Until the very end,
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands.
