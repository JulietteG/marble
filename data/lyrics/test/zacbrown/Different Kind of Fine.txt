She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make you wonder which way to go to
Make a man change his mind.
She's a lawyer's queen and a truckers dream
In a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine

Cadillacs and caviar, well that ain't how she rolls
Implants and tummy tucks, she sure don't need those
She's a cool drink of water when the summers mean
Poured into those Levis jeans
She's country as the day is long.

She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make you wonder which way to go to
Make a man change his mind.
She's a lawyer's queen and a truckers dream
In a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine

Tan and lean like a long neck bottle
In the passengers seat got her hand on the throttle
She'll get you there right on time
Lord, take you down to Tijuana
Make you wanna slap your momma
Gotcha all tore up
Made you spill your dip cup
A bona fide, a different kind of fine

She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make you wonder which way to go to
Make a man change his mind.
She's a lawyer's queen and a truckers dream
In a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
