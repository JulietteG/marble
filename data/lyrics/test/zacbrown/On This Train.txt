Verse 1:
I'm on this train, I can't slow down and,
Breaks are gone, and i'm running out,
of reasons, to even try to stop it now.
And it seems to me no matter where i turn,
i fall off these tracks, and i get burnt,
but someday, i'm gonna finally make it home.

Chorus:
But these wheels keep on taking me the long way,
and i just don't know when they'll finally stop.
but i know if they keep taking me the long way,
the wrong way.
i'm fallin off, aint ever gettin up.

Verse 2:
It's different threw another's eyes,
to see the pain she feels inside,
but her pretty smile, is gonna pull me every time
i got my foot on the gas, full steam ahead,
and i can't forget what my daddy said
happiness is found, inside your heart

(Repeat Chorus)x2 

Verse 3:
Got my foot on the gas, full steam ahead
and i can't forget what my daddy said,
happiness, is found inside your heart,
and someday, i hope you finally make it home.---Lyrics submitted by wes.
