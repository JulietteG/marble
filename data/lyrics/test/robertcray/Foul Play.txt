It's Wednesday night, my woman's out
Once again I'm home alone
Lately, every Wednesday night
She's late getting home

She phones from work at quittin' time
Says the boss asked her to stay
She said she's makin' double time
But I suspect foul play, I suspect foul play

This makes five straight Wednesday nights
And that's no coincidence
Sitting here and thinking back
It all starts making sense

Her old boss quit two months ago
She came home all smiles that day
Said they hired a younger man
But I suspect foul play, said I suspect foul play
Oh, I suspect foul play

Something in her voice
Alerted my suspicious heart
I've heard that warning sign before
Just before love fell apart

This is my last Wednesday night
Waitin' like a fool
I won't stand for another man
No, no, no, that's my hard-fast rule

She'd better have some kind of evidence
Of all this extra pay
She'd better have some cold, hard facts
'Cause I suspect foul play, said I suspect foul play
Oh, I suspect foul play

Yeah, yeah, foul play
Something's going on wrong
Foul play, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
