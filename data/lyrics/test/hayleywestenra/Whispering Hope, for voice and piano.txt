Soft as the voice of an angel
Breathing a lesson I heard
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers a comforting word

Wait till the darkness is over
Wait till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow
After the shower is done

Whispering Hope (Whispering Hope)
Whispering Hope (Oh how welcome)
Welcome (Is thy voice)
Welcome thy voice

Making my heart (Making my heart)
In it's sorrow rejoice

(Whispering Hope) 
Whispering Hope (Oh how welcome)
Welcome (Is thy voice)
Welcome thy voice

Making my heart (Making my heart)
In it's sorrow rejoice---Lyrics submitted by Eleanor.
