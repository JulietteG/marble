Through the window of my soul
All the secrets that i hold
Will be yours to share for always,
always..
Like a whisper in the wind
The gentle breeze touches my skin
and i know you're with me always
always..

I can feel it in the air
The fire that we share
can only come from deep within
It's a light that burns so bright
It guides you through the night
And leads you to me
So find your way back..

Chorus:

(And) hold me,
touch me..
Let the love come rushing through me
I'm yours with every breath i take
forever and ever
Hold on to love
cause deep down
that's we're made of
never let go for my heart's sake
Cause my heart belongs to you

I lie awake to hear you breathe
Only you can feel the need
That builds and burns so
deep inside me,
inside me..

As the moonlight up the sky
There's a thousand reasons why
My heart will only beat for you
You're the reason that i live
So now all I've got to give 
i give it to you
Just don't fight the feeling..

(Back to Chorus)

Don't give up
but just give in
I will always be here
waiting for you
Love will see us through

(Back to Chorus)

aahh ah..

My heart belongs to you
My heart belongs to you
My heart belongs to you

aahh ah..---Lyrics submitted by Jessebel.
