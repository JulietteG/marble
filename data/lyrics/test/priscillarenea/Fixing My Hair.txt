You understand me like no one else does 
You love me perfect thats more than enough 
I cant find a flaw in you not even one 
I know youll be here in the long run 
You know the reason Im so insecure 
And day after day you convince me Im wrong 
Telling me beauty is neither here nor there 
But you understand why Im fixin my hair 

Im fixin my hair for you 
Wanna be beautiful 
Even when you tell me Im so pretty 
I need it to hide all my insecurities 
And Im fixin my hair for you 
Just like you like me to 
Even when you tell me that you couldnt care 
Lest, Im always fixin my hair 

Hours in the mirror for nothing at all 
Staring at my imaginary flaws 
Making excuses to fix what aint broke 
You make me feel better like only you know 
How, why are we where we are? 
With someone like me how did we get this far? 
When we get older hope your still around 
When all of my hair has fallen to the ground 

Im fixin my hair for you 
Wanna be beautiful 
Even when you tell me Im so pretty 
I need it to hide all my insecurities 
And Im fixin my hair for you 
Just like you like me to 
Even when you tell me that you couldnt care 
Lest, Im always fixin my hair 

Please believe me when I say 
I dont mean to be so vain 
But Ive got issues within 
What you see when you look at me 
Is something I could never be 
You gotta understand 
All you ever knew was the pretty girl, the funny girl 
The girl with no worries no cares 
But Ive got a lot that Im hiding inside 
Well thats why Im fixin my hair 

Im fixin my hair for you 
Wanna be beautiful 
Even when you tell me Im so pretty 
I need it to hide all my insecurities 
And Im fixin my hair for you 
Just like you like me to 
Even when you tell me that you couldnt care 
Lest, Im always fixin my hair 

Im always fixin my hair, for you 
For you, for you, for you 

Even when you tell me that you couldnt care 
Lest, Im always fixin my hair---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
