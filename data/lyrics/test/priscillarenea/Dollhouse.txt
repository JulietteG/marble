I'm just a girl
And you're just a boy
This is my heart
It's not a toy
So what's with you playing with my mind?

We used to be cool
This used to be love
Now it's become
Something like a job
Like it or not
Maybe things are changing
Right before our eyes

I tried to be your picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryin to control me
Like some kind of barbie
But that just ain't me

Cause I ain't a doll
This ain't a dollhouse
Your way too old to be
Putting me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll
This ain't a dollhouse
No I could never be stuck living life like this
Behind these four walls
Cause I ain't a doll

You call the shots
Right down to my shoes
I liked what you liked
Cause  you told me to
And I don't think that you could even tell
I fell out of love
But it never showed
I gave up on us
So long ago
But you'll never know
Baby don't pretend like you know me so well

I tried to be your picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryin to control me
Like some kind of barbie
But that just ain't me

Cause I ain't a doll
This ain't a dollhouse
Your way too old to be
Putting me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll
This ain't a dollhouse
No I could never be stuck living life like this
Behind these four walls
Cause  I ain't a doll

I'll never be made of plastic
So glad my hearts elastic
No matter what you do
I'll bounce back off of you
Cut me but I'm not bleeding

I tried to be your picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryin to  control me
Like some kind of barbie
But that just ain't me

Cause I ain't a doll
This ain't a dollhouse
Your way too old to be
Putting me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll
This ain't a dollhouse
No I could never be stuck living life like this
Behind these four walls
Cause I ain't a doll

And I come with imperfections
Epitome of perfection
If you can't understand
Loving the way I am
Then you're no good for me
So glad I kept my receipt---Lyrics submitted by cierra.
