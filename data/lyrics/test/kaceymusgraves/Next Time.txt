I've gotten this far on my own
I don't have anything set in stone
I know, I don't need you
I've got twenty bucks and this road ahead
Plenty of time to clear my head
And I know, I don't need you

Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
Toughen up and be more outspoken
More than I was back then
I won't let my heart get broken
There is a next time

I'm staring down at these white lines
They're taking me further and passing the time
I know, I don't need you
You had one last chance and you threw it away
It don't matter what I've gotta say
And I know, I don't need you

Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
Toughen up and be more outspoken
I know more than I did back then
I won't let my heart get broken
There is a next time

Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
I'm gonna toughen up and be more outspoken
More than I was back then
I won't let my heart get broken

I've gotten this far on my own
I don't have anything set in stone
I know, I don't need you---Lyrics submitted by Erica Moore.
