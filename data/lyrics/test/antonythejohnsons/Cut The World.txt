For so long Ive obeyed that feminine decree
Ive always contained your desire to hurt me

But when will I turn and cut the world?

My eyes are coral, absorbing your dreams
My skin is a surface to push to extremes
My heart is a record of dangerous scenes


But when will I turn and cut the world?
When will I turn and cut the world? (repeat)

When will I turn and cut the world? (repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
