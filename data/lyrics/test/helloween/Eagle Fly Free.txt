People are in big confusion
They don't like their constitutions
Everyday they draw conclusions
And they're still prepared for war

Some can say what's ineffective
Some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective
Well your life seems quite bizarre

Bridge: in the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on it's wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity

Chorus: eagle fly free
Let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
Follow the sign
together we'll fly someday

Hey, we think so supersonic
And we make our bombs atomic
Or the better quite neutronic
But the poor don't see a dime

Nowadays the air's polluted
Ancient people persecuted
That's what mankind contributed
To create a better time

Bridge: in the sky a mighty eagle
doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
on it's wings the rainbow's light
it's flying to eternity

Chorus: eagle fly free
let people see
just make it your own way
leave time behind
follow the sign
together we'll fly someday---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
