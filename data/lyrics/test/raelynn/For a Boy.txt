For A boy a pretty see thru
For a boy you sure let your guard down when you know what you want
What will you see, baby right now youre looking at me
The way you say my name, I know youre not playing games

For a boy, youre good at saying sorry
For a boy, I sure can feel your heart, Its like a freight train, coming at me
Im across the booth, on the edge of my seat
You dont make me wait, you say what you came to say

Go on get it out boy, say Im the only one that makes you crazy
Come on tell me how boy, how Im the only thing youre thinking about lately
What you dont know, what you dont know
Is what a girl like me would do for a boy like you

For a girl, Im pretty cool, calm and collected
For a girl, whose getting more than she expected
From an ex-love but here I am youre putting your heart in the palm of my hand
Im trying to act real cool, but inside Im a lovesick fool

For a boy like you (yeah)

Go on and say it all boy, put every last feeling out on the table
Come on, its last call boy, before the night ends lets give this a label
Cause, what you dont know, what you dont know
Is what a girl would do for a boy like you
For a boy like you

What a girl like me would do for a boy like you---
