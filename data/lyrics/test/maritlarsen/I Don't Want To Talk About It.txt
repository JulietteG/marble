This is not a song about his lips
This is not another tender wish
That was then and these were different days
Even now I sometimes miss the taste

This is not a song about the night
We were young and everything was right
When all the things we did just seem to work
Now the news is oh and it just seem to hurt, just seem to hurt
Don't talk about what've we are
Don't talk about what've we been
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it
It's just never one mistake
It's just never one heartbreak
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it

This is not for all the tears we cried
This is not another worthless battlefield
It all comes back to me with no regrets
I rather let it go than just forget, just forget

Don't talk about what've we are
Don't talk about what've we been
What done is done, I don't want to talk about it
It's just never one mistake
It's just never one heartbreak
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it

All of the good that remains
All that memory contains
All that is still in it's place after he walked away
He is the reason
You are the reason why I...
Don't talk about what've we are
Don't talk about what've we been
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it
It's just never one mistake
It's just never one heartbreak
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it

Don't talk about what've we are
Don't talk about what've we been
What's done is done, is done, is done
I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about it
It's done it's done
I don't want to talk about it

It's just never one mistake
It's just never one heartbreak
What's done is done, I don't want to talk about it---
