Beautiful beautiful brown eyes;
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes;
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes;
I'll never love blue eyes again.

Molly my darlin' I love you;
Love you with all of my heart;
Tomorrow we might have been married;
But ramblin' has kept us apart.

Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes;
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes;
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes;
I'll never love blue eyes again.

Life's full of trouble and sorrow;
Life's full of heartaches and woe;
And I need the love of my woman;
To guide me where ever I go.

Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes;
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes;
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes;
I'll never love blue eyes again.

I'll never love blue eyes again.---Lyrics submitted by T J Autry.
