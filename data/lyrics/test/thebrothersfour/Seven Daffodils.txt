I may not have mansion I haven't any land
Not even a paper dollar to crinkle in my hand

But I can show you morning on a thousand hills 
And kiss you and give you seven daffodils

I donot have a fortune to buy you pretty things
But I can weave you moon beams for necklaces and rings

And I can show you morning on a thouands hills 
And kiss you and give you seven daffodils

Oh,.   Seven daffodils are shining in the sun
To light away to evening when our days is done

And I will give you music and a crust of bread
A pillow of piney boughs to rest your head
A pillow of piney boughs to rest your head---Lyrics submitted by Youngock.
