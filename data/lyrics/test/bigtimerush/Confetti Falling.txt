All this talk about being in love
I could never get into the party
Never really understood what it was
Whats the big deal anyway?

Oh, I but I decided I should give it a try
The very moment you gave me the invite
Ive never seen anything like it before
Once you open the door See I was like.

Oh yeah yeah dont get any better
Oh yeah yeah wish that this was forever
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling
And its a celebration,
Feels like a celebration
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling Down, Down, Down.

And everybody make an appearance
Even the butterflies came what a feeling
Then bliss came with mister first kiss
It was better than they ever explained it

I think I even saw cupid flying round
I caught a glimpse before the lights went down
And when I turn to see the stars in eyes
I realize

Oh yeah yeah dont get any better
Oh yeah yeah wish that this was forever
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling
And its a celebration,
Feels like a celebration
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling
Down, Down, Down.

See I know its getting late
Only wish the sun would wait
Let this party last a little longer
See I know love it comes and goes
But this right here
I dont think I ever want to let it go
I wish I wouldve known.

All this talk about being in love
I could never get into the party
Now I understand because
You show me the way

Oh yeah yeah dont get any better
Oh yeah yeah wish that this was forever
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling
And its a celebration,
Feels like a celebration
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling
Down, Down, Down.---Lyrics submitted by Steven Santiago.
