Get a call on a random afternoon
I pick it up & I see that it's you
Like my heart, you were breaking the news
You said it's over, it's over, it's over

Heading out, cuz I'm outta my mind
All my friends are gonna see me tonight
Staying here, till the sun start's to rise
& I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

Dance hard, laugh hard
turn the music up now
Party like a rockstar
Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do
anything that I have to
till I forget about you.

Jump up, fall down
gonna play it loud now.
Don't care, my head's
spinning all around now.
I swear I'll do
anything that I have to
till I forget about you.

I thought I'd be here on my own
waiting for you to knock on my door
Since you left, I don't by the phone
& I, I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving.

I found a place where I can't lose myself
& just leave your memory on the shelf.
See I'm fine, no I don't need nobody else
Cuz I, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

To dance hard, laugh hard
turn the music up now
Party like a rockstar
Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do
anything that I have to
till I forget about you.

Jump up, fall down
gonna play it loud now.
Don't care, my head's
spinning all around now.
I swear I'll do
anything that I have to
till I forget about you.

Spending money like I don't need a thing
I'm going crazy now I don't even think
I'm losing my mind, that's all I can do
till I forget about you

Dance hard, laugh hard
turn the music up now
Party like a rockstar
Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do
anything that I have to
till I forget about you.

Jump up, fall down
gonna play it loud now.
Don't care, my head's
spinning all around now.
I swear I'll do
anything that I have to
till I forget about you.

Till I forget about you

Till I forget about you---Lyrics submitted by cali.
