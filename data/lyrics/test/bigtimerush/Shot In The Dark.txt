I promise I would be there
I swear I'm on my way
I know you may not hear me
But that's the price I'll pay

For taking you for granted
You're the air I breathe
I gave you everything but
It was everything but me

I don't know how I would ever go all alone walking on my own
Like angels, you were floating to me
And that's how it should be

'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment
I don't wanna pay for things unspoken
I just wanna race with arms wide open
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are

I don't wanna watch the world keep changing
When I'm not with you my heart keeps shaking
Cover up my eyes and just stop pacing
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are
Take a shot in the dark.

I promised you I'd reach you
I swear I'm almost there
As the road was disappearing
You made it all so clear

I don't know how I would ever go all alone walking on my own
Like angels you were floating to me
And that's how it should be, yeah.

'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment (waste another moment)
I don't wanna pay for things unspoken
I just wanna race with arms wide open
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are.

I don't wanna watch the world keep changing (watch the world keep changing)
When I'm not with you my heart keeps shaking
Cover up my eyes and just stop pacing
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are.

I promise you I'm gonna be there
I wanna be there
No matter what happens
No matter how tragic

'Cause the clock is ticking
The world is spinning
Our lives are passing us by [continues into next verse for about 4 beats]

'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment
I don't wanna pay for things unspoken
I just wanna race with arms wide open
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are

I don't wanna watch the world keep changing
When I'm not with you my heart keeps shaking
Cover up my eyes and just stop pacing
Take a shot in the dark to be where you are
Take a shot in the dark.---Lyrics submitted by Christian J.
