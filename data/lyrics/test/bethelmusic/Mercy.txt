You delight in showing mercy
Mercy triumphs over judgment

My past embraced
My sin forgiven
I'm blameless in Your sight
My history rewritten

You delight in showing mercy
Mercy triumphs over judgment

Oh love, great love
Fear cannot be found in You
There will never be a day
You're uncertain of the ones You choose

You delight in showing mercy
Mercy triumphs over judgment

I will wake and spend my days
Loving the One who was raised me up
From death to life, from wrong to right
You're making all things beautiful

You delight in showing mercy
Mercy triumphs over judgment---
