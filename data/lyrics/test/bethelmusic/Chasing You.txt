You hide I wanna find you
Go and I will follow you
I wanna be where you are

as you move, I'm right beside you
Lord, I'm running after you
I wanna be where you are

I'm chasing you ,I'm so in love
captivated, I just can't get enough
I'll spend my days running after your heart, your heart, your heart oh woah woah woah woah

I'm chasing you, with all my life,
Captivated I just can't get enough
I'll spend my days running after your heart, your heart, your heart
oh woah woah woah woah

Heart, (you've won my heart)
you've won me heart and soul
(Heart and soul)
And where you lead I'll go
(I will go)
I wanna be where you are
(oh woah oh oh oh)

From the moment I rise
To the moment I sleep
My affection is for you
And even as I dream
I wanna know you
I'm after your heart

I'm chasing you ,I'm so in love
Captivated, I just can't get enough
I'll spend my days running after your heart, your heart, your heart oh woah woah woah woah

I'm chasing you, with all my life,
Captivated I just can't get enough
I'll spend my days running after your heart, your heart, your heart
oh woah woah woah woah

This life, this love
Was always meant to be
A wild crazy adventure
Discovering, the thrill, the rush
The more of you I see,
The more it leaves me wanting your everything
Your Everything

I'm chasing you ,I'm so in love
Captivated, I just can't get enough
I'll spend my days running after your heart, your heart, your heart oh woah woah woah woah

I'm chasing you, with all my life,
Captivated I just can't get enough
I'll spend my days running after your heart, your heart, your heart
oh woah woah woah woah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
