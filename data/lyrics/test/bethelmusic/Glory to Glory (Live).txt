Created from dust
You came and You lived among us
Taken on our frame, You walked in our pain
And now You're taking us higher

You stepped into time
You laid down Your life to save us
You took on our shame
On the cross it was laid
And now You're taking us higher

We go from glory to glory to glory
We'll never be the same, never be the same
We go from glory to glory to glory
We're forever changed, forever changed

You called Your friend
Brought into Your endless kingdom
By the blood I was made, no longer a slave
And now You're taking us higher

We go from glory to glory to glory
We'll never be the same, never be the same
We go from glory to glory to glory
We're forever changed, forever changed

Until we reach the day
Love conquers everything
We'll cry an anthem singing
Holy, holy
And when we see that day
We're standing face to face
We'll shout an anthem singing
Holy, holy

You took on the grave
So not even death can shake us
See the victor has won
And Heaven has come
Now You're taking us higher
Now You're taking us higher

We go from glory to glory to glory
We'll never be the same, never be the same
You take us higher and higher and higher
We're forever changed, forever changed---
