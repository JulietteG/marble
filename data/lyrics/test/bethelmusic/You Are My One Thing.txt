Your voice ever close you called me
You never gave up pursuing
I fell in love you stole my heart

Your hand ever near I hold to
I long for your heart to know you
Just to live in your fellowship

Just to be close to you Just to walk next to you
This is my one thing You are my one thing
Just to be close to you Just to walk next to you
This is my one thing You are my one thing

My eyes ever fixed upon you
To live like a child to trust you
Ill hold on to this treasured love
My life ever set at your feet
I give you my heart completely
To live this life always by your side

I have to know you
All thats within me
Cries out for your presence, God
Nothing compares
Theres no one else
Jesus youre my one desire---
