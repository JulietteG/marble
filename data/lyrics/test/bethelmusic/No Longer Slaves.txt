You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone
Im no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
Ive been born again, into your family
Your blood flows through my veins

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
All my fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
So I could stand and sing
I am child of God---
