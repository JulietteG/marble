Praise to Your name
The name that's so much higher than all names

All honor to Your name
All honor to Your name
The name that's so much greater than all names

Be lifted up
Be lifted higher
Be lifted up
Be lifted higher

Your name is life
Your name is hope inside me, hope inside me
Your name is love
A love that always finds me, always finds me

Be lifted up
Be lifted higher
