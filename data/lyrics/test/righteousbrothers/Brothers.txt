There were two boys,
Who owned just a few toys.
But dreamed that someday they could say,
"Hey, take a look at us we're someone".

There were two guys, 
Both with blue eyes.
Who knew that someday they could say, 
"Hey, take a look at us we're someone".

They chose to sing the blues.
Green lights and sunny skies,
Only one way to go.
Things looked good,
Records on the charts,
Their sound became blue-eyed soul.

Cocktail parties, lots of laughs,
Catch another plane, sign some autographs.
But those hotel rooms began to look all the same.
You're not really brothers, tell me what's your real names?

We are two men,
Who are the best of friends.
But knew that someday one would say
"Hey, take a look at me."---Lyrics submitted by Marilyn.
