Is this just a feeling
That comes between us
When I see your face
When I meet your eyes
A mean reflection

I cant help you to
Be nobodys fool
Its just that
I cant help you too
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Yeah

Its just that I cant be your fool
When I try and I cant understand
I feel and I feel and its making me cry
I wander around breaking hearts everyday
You feel and I feel and I just want to be your fool
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Yeah

Times are changing, rearranging
Things will turn in time
Youre my painting, meant for filming
Keep my soul in mind
Kiss my soul in time
Make the film in time
Make the film in time
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool
Yeah
Be nobodys fool
Nobodys fool
Nobodys fool
Be nobodys fool

I try and I try and I cant understand
I feel and I feel and its making me cry (Nobodys fool)
(Be nobodys fool)
I wander around breaking hearts everyday
I feel and I feel and I just want to be (Nobodys fool)
(Be nobodys fool)
I try and I cant understand
I feel and I feel and its making me cry
