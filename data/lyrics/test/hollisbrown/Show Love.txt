show love cos theres more to be learned from her
tomorrow i'm leavin
back home to a city that never sleeps
but everyones dreamin
in 3 days when i realize the day is long
and the sky it looks tired
ill be thinkin bout times that i spent with you
and the life i admire

cos these are the days that i'll always remember
when everyone changes around me my friend
a place of the night in the late you be lyin
and doin my best that i can

some may call it lazy or crazyness
and some may call it simple
but alone in a place that i swallowed you
its something less humbling

cos these are the days that i'll always remember
when everyone changes around you my friend
a place of the night in the late you be lyin
and doin the best that i can





show love cos theres more to be learned from her
tomorrow i'm leavin
back home to a city that never sleeps
but everyones dreamin

cos these are the days that i'll always remember
when everyone changes around me my friend
a place of the night in the late you be lyin
and doin my best that i can

wohhhh these are the days that i'll always remember
when everyone changes around you my friend
a place of the night in the late you be lyin
and doin the best that i can
wohhh---Lyrics submitted by joe.
