Turn slowly, each day's so fast
But I don't have the strength
All I see Is broken glass
With tiny shards of pain

And change Is coming my way
But I still feel the same
I still feel the same [2x]

Hold structure, don't let life pass
Let yourself be free
'Cause you're much more
Forget the past
I'm your enemy

And change Is coming my way
But I still feel the same
I still feel the same [2x]

It's quiet, (It's quiet)
It's calm now, (It's calm now)
I'm waiting, (I'm waiting)
To fall down, (To fall down)
You showed me, (You showed me)
That I need hope, (That I need hope)
And I need change, (And I need change)
To know how It feels to be alone
How does It feels to be alone?

And change Is coming my way
But I still feel the same
I still feel the same [2x]

Change Is coming my way
But I still feel the same
I still feel the same

It's quiet,
It's calm now,
I'm waiting,
To fall down,
You showed me,
That I need hope,
And I need change,
I still feel the same---Lyrics submitted by Zilg Oicapse.
