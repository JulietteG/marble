I'm stuck with writing songs just to forget,
What they really were about and these words
Are bringing me so deeply in debt
that I don't think I can dig my way out.
I couldn't breathe you in like I need to
And the words don't mean a thing.

So I'll sing this song to you, for the last time.
And my heart is torn in two,
Thinkin' of days spent without you.
And there is nothing left to prove

I'm counting all the things I could've done,
To make you see that I wanted us to be
What I go to sleep and dream of
I want you to know that i'd die for you.
I'd die for you.
I couldn't breathe you in like I need to
And the words don't mean a thing

So I'll sing this song to you, for the last time.
And my heart is torn in two
Thinkin' of days spent without you.
And there's nothing else to prove
And if you are alone make sure you're not lonely.
Cause if you are I blame myself.
For never being home.
I know I'm not the only one
Who will treat you like they should.
Like you deserve.

I'm stuck with writing songs just to forget.

So I'll sing this song to you for the last time.
And my heart is torn in two.
Thinkin' of days spent without you.
And there's nothing left to prove.

There's nothing(x2)

There's nothing left to prove...---Lyrics submitted by Arvin.
