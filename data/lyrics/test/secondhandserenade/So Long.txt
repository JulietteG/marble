I am leaving for a while
can you tell me that
we will be ok

Your friends think that I am no good
all they ever do is
try to pull you away

But I won't let them ever take you
ever take you
ever take you

So long
I waited for this day
to find someone to go to
And I just wanna tell you
That is so on
we're leaving yesterday
And I don't think life will ever be the same
Let's take this all away

Long dead silence on the phone
Leading to a dial tone
This is not what I have planned

Endless memories without you
Life passing by without you
each day just like a grain of sand

But I won't let them ever take you
ever take you
ever take you

So long
I waited for this day
to find someone to go to
And I just wanna tell you
That is so on
we're leaving yesterday
And I don't think life will ever be the same
Let's take this all away

Can you face me
can you wait for it
can you taste me
can you fight for it  
3x(fight for it)

Will you fight for it?

So long
I waited for this day
to find someone to go to
And I just wanna tell you
That is so on
we're leaving yesterday
And I don't think life will ever be the same
Let's take this all away

So long
I waited for this day
to find someone to go to
And I just wanna tell you
That is so on
we're leaving yesterday
And I don't think life will ever be the same
Let's take this all away---Lyrics submitted by Aznirsham.
