When you try your best
But you don't suceed
When you get what you want
But not what you need
When you feel so tired
But you can't sleep
Stuck In reverse

And the tears come streaming,
Down you face
When you lose something,
You can't replace
When you love someone
But It goes to waste
Could It be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And Ignite your bones
I will try to fix you

High up above or down below
When you're too In love to let It go
But If you never try you'll never know
Just what your worth

Lights will guide you home
And Ignite your bones
I will try to fix you

[Music break]---Lyrics submitted by Zilg Oicapse.
