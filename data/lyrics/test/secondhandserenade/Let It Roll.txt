The night smells like December
And we're deep undercover
Staking out what could be better than all the money in the world

And I am watching you and I am waiting
For the perfect time to start participating
And you signal me to stay
But I open my mouth anyway

Now it's over, we're goners
It's out of our control
And if there's one thing that I know
It's that it's best to let it roll
So lets just let it roll
Let's just let it roll

Your hazel eyes paralyze my senses
Cut me down to size defenseless
I'm defenseless

And I know it's late but I am waiting
For the moment that I've been anticipating
And I signal you to go, where it will take us I don't know

And now it's over, we're goners
It's out of our control
And if there's one thing that I know
It's that it's best to let it roll
So let's just let it roll
Let's just let it roll

Just don't waste your night before it's started
Make sure I'm worth every single second, Yeah

And now it's over, we're goners
It's out of our control
And if there's one thing that I know
It's that it's best to let it roll
So let's just let it roll
Let's just let it roll

And now it's over, we're goners
It's out of our control
And if there's one thing that I know
It's that it's best to let it roll
So let's just let it roll
Let's just let it roll---Lyrics submitted by secret.
