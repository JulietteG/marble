She fixes her lips 
They always look perfect 
Never a smudged line 
Never too much 

I try on my blue shirt 
She told me she liked it 
She wonders what I'll wear 
She knows just what she'll wear 

She always wears blue 
So sneakers or flip flops? 
I'm starting to panic 
Remember she asked you 

Remember to breathe 
And everything will be okay 
Okay 
Alright---Lyrics submitted by Troi.
