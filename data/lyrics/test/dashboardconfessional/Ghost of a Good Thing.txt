I guess it's luck but it's the same
Hard luck you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love but it's like you said
Love is like a role that we play
But I believe in you so much
I could die for the words that you say
But I believe in you so much
I could die from the words that you say

But you're chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
It's getting away from you again
While you're chasing ghosts

I guess it's luck but it's the same
Hard luck you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love but it's like you said
Love is like a role that we play
But I believe in you so much
I could die for the words that you say
But I believe in you so much
I could die from the words that you say

But you're chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
It's getting away from you again
While you're chasing ghosts

Just bend the pieces till they fit
Like they were made for it
But they weren't meant for this
No they weren't meant for this

Just bend the pieces till they fit
Like they were made for it
But they weren't meant for this

Chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
It's getting away-way-way-way from you again

Chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
It's getting away from you again
While you're chasing ghosts---Lyrics submitted by Nina Chance.
