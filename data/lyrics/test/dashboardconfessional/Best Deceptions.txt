I heard about your trip,
I heard about your souvenirs,
I heard about the cool breeze, 
And the cool lights,
And the cool guys,
That you spent them with,
I guess I should've heard of them from you,
I guess I should've heard of them from you,

[Chorus]
Well don't you see, don't you see,
That the charade is over,
And all the best deceptions,
And the clever cover story awards,
Goes to you,
So kiss me hard,
Cause this will be the last time that I'll let you
You will be back someday,
And this awkward kiss that tells of other peoples lips,
Will be of service,
To giving you away

I heard about your regrets,
I heard that you were feeling sorry,
I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right,
Between us,
Well I guess I should've heard of that from you,
I guess I should've heard of that from you

[Chorus]
Well don't you see, don't you see,
That the charade is over,
And all the best deceptions,
And all the clever cover story awards,
Go to you,
So kiss me hard,
Cause this will be the last time that I'll let you,
You will be back someday,
And this awkward kiss that screams of other peoples lips,
Will be of service,
Of giving you away,
To giving you away

I'm waiting for blood,
To flow to my fingers,
I'll be alright,
When my hands get warm,
Ignoring the phone,
I'd rather say nothing,
I'd rather you never heard my voice,
You're calling too late,
Too late to be gracious,
You do not want it,
Long good-byes,
You're calling too late,
You're calling too late,
You're calling too late---Lyrics submitted by Trish.
