Down in a local bar
Out on the boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you from sinking
It's a long way down
It's a long way

Back like you never broke 
You tell a dirty joke
He touches your leg and thinks
He's getting close 
For now you let him just this once
Just for now 
And just like that...it's over

Don't  turn away
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Don't be afraid
Keep it all inside
All inside

When you fall apart
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Life is always hard for 
The belle of the boulevard 

In all your silver rings 
And all your silken things
That song you softly sing
Is keeping you from breaking
It's a long way down
It's a long way

Back here you never loved
You've shakes the shivers off 
You take a drink to get your 
Courage up
Can you belive it
 just this once just for now
And just like that
It's over

Don't turn away 
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes 
Don't be afraid
Keepbit all inside
All inside

When you fall apart
Dry your eyes 
Dry your eyes
Life is always hard For
The belle of the boulevard

Please hold on
 it's alright
Please hold on
 it's alright
Please hold on

Down in al local bar 
Out on the boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you

Don't turn away
Dry your eyes 
Dry your eyes
Don't be afraid 
Keep it all inside
All inside 

When you fall apart
Gonna dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Life is always hard for
The belle of the boulevard---Lyrics submitted by diana.
