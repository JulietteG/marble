Did it all for you to say 
You never wanted me that way 
Now the dogs have had their meat
I think I'll go plug in the mains 
I tumble like a clown 
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself 
Into your hands 
When you spare a make-up smile
I'm instantly your biggest fan
How I was to know that 
You practised it beforehand? 
I tumble like a clown 
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself
Into your hands---Lyrics submitted by archida.
