Limb by limb and tooth by tooth,
Tearing up inside of me,
Every day, every hour, just wish that I...
Was bulletproof

Wax me, mould me, 
Heat the pins and stab them in,
You have turned me into this, just wish that it...
Was bulletproof
Was bulletproof

So pay me money and take a shot,
Lead fill the hole in me,
I could burst a million bubbles, all surrogate...
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof---Lyrics submitted by xochitl.
