Ive been trying to paint a masterpiece
But Ive been colouring all the wrong things
We all fall down and skin our knees
Just keep running, let it bleed
Because youre already a masterpiece

Well I could have stayed here and I could have gone home
I could be with you or I could be alone
I could cry a river, I could write a song
I could get the whole world to sing along
I could have stayed here and I could have stayed home.

But were not fallen angels,
ruined by the grass growing tall
when we find theres life on earth after all,
after all.
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Ive been talking to myself, but I dont make sense
I cant live on both sides of the fence
I cant make you happy, or hold your hand
And I dont want to be my own best friend
Talking to myself, but I dont make sense

But were not fallen angels,
ruined by the grass growing tall
when we find theres life on earth after all,
after all.
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Ive been trying to paint a masterpiece
Ive been trying to paint a masterpiece
Ive been trying to paint a masterpiece
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

But were not fallen angels,
ruined by the grass growing tall
when we find theres life on earth after all,
No were not fallen angels
ruined by the grass growing tall
when we find theres life on earth after all,
La la la la la la
