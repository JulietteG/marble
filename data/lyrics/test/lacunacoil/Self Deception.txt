I'll never waste another day,
Searching to find the reason,
Why did I choose to play this game?
This goes too far I'll take no more..

I played a part and took the blame,
While you pretend nothing is real,
Light turns to night as you're asleep,
Blood flowing down, is this a dream?

Liar, you tempt me..
Liar, you tempt me..

I don't know what to do,
No guilt is in my heart,
I don't know what to do,
I'm not the reason..

I'll never waste another day,
Forever lost, no reason,
He never chose to play this game,
Taken too far out of control..

Liar, you tempt me..
Liar, you tempt me..

I don't know what to do,
No guilt is in my heart,
I don't know what to do,
I'm not the reason..

I don't know what to do,
No guilt is in my heart,
I don't know what to do,
I'm not the reason..

I don't know what to do, 
No guilt is in my heart, 
I don't know what to do, 
I'm not the reason..

I don't know what to do,
No guilt is in my heart,
I don't know what to.
I'm not the reason.---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca Wade.
