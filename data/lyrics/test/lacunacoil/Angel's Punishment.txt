Destruction

War

To fight in defence
Forgotten words
of friendly hate

war - destruction
war - destruction

I don't know why
A soul deceased
A broken hope
A choking breeze

war - destruction
war - destruction

Can't you take me away from your lies?
Can't you take me away from your lies?

Destruction

Dark paradise
Collecting souls
To analize

war - destruction
war - destruction

The bitter blood
of children's cry
inside the truth
far from my sky

war - destruction
war - destruction

Can't you take me away from your lies?
Can't you take me away from your lies?

Can't you take me away from your lies?
Can't you take me away from your lies?

Can't you take me
Can't you take me
Can't you take me
Can't you take me---Lyrics submitted by Monika.
