I saw some people starving
there was murder there was rape
their villages were burning
they were trying to escape
I couldnt meet their glances
I was staring at my shoes
I was acid it was tragic
it was almost like the blues
it was almost like the blues

I have to die a little
between each murderous thought
and when Im finished thinking
I have to die a lot
theres torture and theres killing
and theres all my bad reviews
the war, the children missing, Lord
its almost like the blues
its almost like the blues

So I let my heart get frozen
to keep away the rot
my father says Im chosen
my mother says Im not
I listened to their story
of the gypsies and the Jews
it was good it wasnt boring
it was almost like the blues
It was almost like the blues

There is no G-d in heaven
and there is no hell below
so says the grey professor
of all there is to know
but Ive had the invitation
that a sinner cant refuse
and its almost like salvation
its almost like the blues
Its almost like the blues---
