Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want to

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you...

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees whither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees whither
Its Spring and its Summer
And its Winter forever

Did I ever love you
Does it really matter
Did I ever fight you
You dont need to answer

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you... ---
