The day is ending
And the same old pain begins
Each deeper shade of blue
Brings back more of you to miss
I fight the tears again
But I just can't win and...

Here comes the night
And here I go out of my mind again
Here comes the night
And here I go crazy missin' you
Wanting you
Needing you
I just can't stand it

Here comes the night again
I still remember
You lyin' next to me
The love would go so deep
We wouldn't get to sleep at all
These nights I'm losing sleep
To a lonely memory

Here comes the night
And here I go out of my mind again
Here comes the night
And here I go crazy missin' you
Wanting you
Needing you
I just can't stand it

Here comes the night again
Will it never end
Why can't I get forever
Here comes the night
And here I go out of my mind again
Here comes the night
And here I go crazy missin' you
Wanting you
Needing you
I just can't stand it
Here comes the night again---
