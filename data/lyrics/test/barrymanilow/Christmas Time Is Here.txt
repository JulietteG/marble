Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of year
Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Golden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleighbells in the air
Beauty everywhere 
Good times by the fire sight
Enjoyful memories there
Christmas time of year 
Christmas time is here
Oooohhhh
Christmas time is here
We'll be growing here
We could always sing
Such spirit through the year
Christmas time is here
christmas time is here---Lyrics submitted by shaniiquah.
