Doesn't matter where I go
Doesn't matter who I know
Nowadays I always find
You are always on my mind
All I think about is love
Love is all I'm dreamin' of
I lay around in a daze
Thinkin' of all the ways

I wanna do it,do it with you
I wanna do it,do it with you
I wanna hold you all night long
Ooh baby,feel so strong
I wanna do it,do it with you
I wanna do it,do it with you
I want to love out my fantasies

Come on baby please
Say you will say I can
Say that I can be your man
You've been out had your flings
I've been waiting in the wings
I know my part I know my lines
I've rehearsed so many times
Let me turn the lights down low
And we can get on with the show

I wanna do it,do it with you
I wanna do it,do it with you
I wanna hold you all night long
Ooh baby,feel so strong
I wanna do it,do it with you
I wanna do it,do it with you
I want to love out my fantasies

Come on baby please
Oh honey,move on in my direction
Time for some serious affection
Oh,it's gonna be such a fine thing
Talk about thunder and lightning

I wanna do it,do it with you
I wanna do it,do it with you
I wanna hold you all night long
Ooh baby,feel so strong
I wanna do it,do it with you
I wanna do it,do it with you
I want to love out my fantasies
Come on baby---
