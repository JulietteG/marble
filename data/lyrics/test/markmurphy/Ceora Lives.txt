Ceora Lives
Music by Lee Morgan & lyrics by Mark Murphy
Recorded by Mark Murphy

The aura still lingers on, the feeling's still warm
Lee Morgan wrote a song like the clump before storms

A storm was closer badly ever I haven't known
Anywhere hed go, his destiny was there
Time and time again he played the risk in a game
A game with its wind caused on his music stopped, so listen to me

On dizzy and clipped tune, his all sound was born
I'll paint a better horn, broke your heart with his tone

All alone, he'll take you with him on his trip
Funny fucking trip and then the ending or but maybe not
Ceora lives and the mystery unforced resist to lessen

Scatting

Inst.

On dizzy and clipped tune, his all sound was born
I'll paint a better horn, broke your heart with his tone

All alone, he'll take you with him on his trip
Funny fucking trip and then the ending or but maybe not
Ceora lives and the mystery unforced resist to lessen on and on

On and on, Ceora, Ceora---Lyrics submitted by Koji Kondo.
