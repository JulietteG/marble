Dance boogie
wonderland
dance boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts,
of men who need more than they get
daylight deals a bad hand,
to a woman that has laid to many bets

The mirror stares you in the face and says
"baby, uh uh it don't work"
you say your prayers through you don't care
you dance and shake the hurt
dance boogie wonderland
dance boogie wonderland

Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl drams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland

All the love in the world can't be gone
all the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing
and my heart keeps saying
"boogie wonderland, wonderland"
dance boogie wonderland
dance boogie wonderland

All the love in the world can't be gone
all the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing
and my heart keeps saying
"boogie wonderland, wonderland"
dance boogie wonderland
dance boogie wonderland---
