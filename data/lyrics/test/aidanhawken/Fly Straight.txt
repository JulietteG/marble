Call me anytime
I'll be right there for you
I'll lift you up when you are low
You helped me to undo
The selfish things I've done
I thought I was the only one

Fly straight to the sun
I feel like we've just begun
And I'm overcome

It tears me up each time
I think of you with him
I only have myself to blame
And though it seems
I've lost my mind
You never were a waste of time

Fly straight to the sun
I feel like we've just begun
And I'm overcome---Lyrics submitted by Randon.
