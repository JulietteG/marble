The grave robber's work is never done
It's up all night and sleep all day
The hours are shit with hell to pay
Pockets are brimming from our unique brand of sinning
When the ladies claw my back at night
I know I'm onto something right.

I deliver the goods as long as they don't ask
Deny Deny Deny Deny
I'm a working stiff like dear old dad
And to you and yours 
Nothing but curses
You'll slave your life away
And for what?
You're just as dead as these old fucks
They'll never get me
I'll never run out of stock
With every second that ticks past
The bodies are still stacking up.

So I've clipped a few fingers off
To get that gold for which I lust
From the deadman's bank and trust
To the depths of hell or bust 
The blackened bits
Of exhumed evidence
Embedded neath my fettered fingernails
Its but a smallish part
Of what our dirty work entails
Come dance with me.

This graveyard planet that you've called earth
You hold in such a high regard
Its but as worthless as a turd
Will you follow me into the dark?
(Will you follow me into the dark?)

I rob the dead
For what their worth
Jewels wealth clothing sex
When the mood prefers
To carve a sullen path through life
Within the fallen's shoes
You'd turn your nose at me
Although I smell of sheik perfumes.

So I've clipped a few fingers off
To get that gold for which I lust
From the deadman's bank and trust
To the depths of hell or bust
Haunted by faces
When I try to close my eyes
So deeply it festers
The guilt is murder.

The blackened bits
Of exhumed evidence
Embedded neath my fettered fingernails
Its but a smallish part
Of what our dirty work entails
May the gods have mercy.
May the gods have mercy.---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
