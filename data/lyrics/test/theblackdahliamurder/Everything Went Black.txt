crawling the walls through every crack and crevice teems blackness
washing over the windowpanes painting the buildings in between
creeping down the alley ways consuming every street soundless swarm
of nothingness sure to doom us all pulling screaming earthlings into
ist toothless jaws endlessly beginning spreading with no sign of stop
horror of horrors truly maddening in size running just prolongs the
end inevitably it strides where has it come from? how can it be stopped? so
quickly we're to meet our end our empire we have lost karmatic armageddon
no religion could foresee a planet once forsaken not even a memory
streetlights bend into the void cars enveloped whole darkness deeper
than a blindman's sleep soon to paint the world insatiable ist hunger it
drinks the sea without a belch stretching to the other side where it is
sure to meet itself unearthly vacuum devouring the hourglass now empty
ist time to say goodbye watching your life flash before mortal eyes terror
fills your heart screams of anguish greet your ears living death voracious
insidious impervious to damage we are slaughtered as if lambs---Lyrics submitted by Ashah.
