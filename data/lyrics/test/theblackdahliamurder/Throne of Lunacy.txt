Oppressive air heary and noxious
Volcanic outpour roars from the heaving angered ancient earth
Storm of spirits raging
Corrosion eats away oxidizing mentally

When they would call to us
When they would beckon us
We would deliver them
We would make them whole again

When they would see the lies
When they would see this world
In glorious anger would rise again in reclamation
Keeper of all chaos uncontrolled
Bringers of truth embody me
Speaker of ends wipe the slate again
Turn man against his brother in deceit

Old ones return to the light
Come the inception of the end
Old ones suspended beyond sight
Crack the earth sphere open
To doom all will descend

Ominous and obscure carnivorous and monstrous
Hideous and slithering dead to eyes but ever dreaming
Behind the stars at high below the stirring sea
Arise and claim your throne of lunacy

They would reach to us
They would summon us
Voices transcend in dream
Echo cthulhu's screams
They do see the lies
They do see this world
They'll part the seas in utter pandemonium

Old ones return to the light
Come the inception of the end
Old ones suspended beyond sight
Crack the earth sphere open
To doom all will descend

Ominous and obscure carnivorous and monstrous
Hideous and slithering dead to eyes but ever dreaming
Behind the stars at high below the stirring sea
Arise and claim your throne of lunacy

Treacherous and impure impious and murderous
Cadaverous yet living dead to eyes but ever dreaming
Beyond the galaxies below the ocean deep
Arise and claim your throne of lunacy---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
