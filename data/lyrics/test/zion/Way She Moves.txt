Convict
Zion baby!

I love the way she moves
I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body
I know she's waiting for me
[x2]

like Shakira belly dancing on the grammy awards
like Beyonce clappin her booty in the MTV show
she so amazing
she drives me crazy

baila baila mamita que te quiero ver
rompiendo la pista abusadura
eres bien tentadora
de todas la mas seductora[x2]

I love the way she moves
I see the way she coming
I wanna rock her body
I know she waiting for me
[x2]

this is so tempting that I cant deny
for us to be together side by side
la noche esta bueno para inventar
'cause me n you together sin parar

ohhhh
excuse me Zion don't mean to interrupt you
but she's fire her way of jiggling it in her attire
dropping it down low while she bring it youp higher
while we singing our

I love the way she moves
the way she coming
I wanna rock her body
I know she waiting for me
[x2]

shorty so sexy I wanna take you to my crib

excuse me Akon let me help you out
she dont speak no English

ella se ve de lo mas bien quiero sacarte de aqui
por si no lo sabias esta noche your gonna end up wit me
then I can describe you you know slip and slide you
flip you over good loving is what I can provide you
if you dont want to then walk away 'cause its your right to
but I wanna show you to the world never hide you
'cause your the most beautifullest thing I ever seen
and you got the potential of blowin me up like gasoline
I'm trying to be patient
trying to be a gentleman
cant you see what you doing to me
yea

I love the way she moves
the way she coming
I wanna rock her body
I know she waiting for me
[x2]
