Where ever the wind blows
You will find me there
Standing exactly where I wana be

I hear a voice in the autumn breeze
Telling me I need to leave
But i can't fly with these broken wings
The leaves they move like poetry
It's all still such a mystery
But I can finally hear the melody

Well I've been here so long
I think It's time I moved on
So tell me where it is that I need to be

Where ever the wind blows
You will find me there
Standing exactly where I wana be
Where ever the wind blows
You will find me there
Standing exactly where I wana be

Wasting time here is killing me
Waiting here for the remedy
So I can hear the sound of angels sing
Letting something carry me to a place I've never seen
'Cause right here I've seen all there is to see

Well I've been here so long
I think It's time I moved on
So tell me where it is that I need to be

Where ever the wind blows
You will find me there
Standing exactly where I wana be
Where ever the wind blows
You will find me there
Standing exactly where I wana be

Well I've been waiting waiting for the day
So can you take me
Carry me away
To where the flame be
How far can you take me
Carry me away

Where ever the wind blows 
You will find me there
Standing exactly where I wana be
Where ever the wind blows
You will find me there 
Standing exactly where I wana be
Where ever the wind blows
You will find me there 
Standing exactly where I wana be---Lyrics submitted by Drake.
