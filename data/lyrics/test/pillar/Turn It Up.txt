I can only imagine
All of the magic that would happen
If we all come together
I could sing of your love forever
Tell me I'm never alone
And that I'm going home
I can hear sounds of melodies
And the remedy
That comes when you
Lift me up
From the flood in the sea of faces
And I promise you we'll make it

'Cause In the healing rain
There is beauty from pain
But the scars remain
I will find a way
To take my life and
And give it all away
And I'll be pressing on
Feel this phenomenon

Turn it up
Throw your hands in the air
All the people everywhere
Let me hear you say
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
Yeah, Yeah
Turn it up
Let the stereos play
All the people everywhere
Let me hear you say
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
Yeah, Yeah

I'm learning to breathe again
Maybe we'll meet again
I hear whispers in the dark
Even the snakes have hearts
So we break free
Won't you breathe into me
I'm drawing a black line
Define the great line
Maybe I just feel so alive
It's a super good feeling
So I'll keep waiting

Will your momentum change
Take a typical day
That you gotta engage
Don't wait for your heart to cave in
Give the freaks something to believe in
It's about a burning fire

If you like it turn it up let me hear you shout
If you want it turn it up gotta live it loud
If you like it turn it up let me hear you shout
If you want it turn it up gotta live it loud---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
