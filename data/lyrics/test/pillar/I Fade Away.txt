As simple minded as it seems
There is only one place for me to be
And it's right here on my knees
Seeking your face
Your whole embrace
Something that I've never felt before
I've never felt before

I make it so hard to believe
That there is someone out there
Reaching out there hand to help me to my feet
I've seen to much
Forgot your touch
Now I'm holding the hand that holds the world
That holds the world

(When I fade away!)
When I See your face I can feel your
I start to fade
(When I fade away!)
When I See your face I can feel your
I start to fade

I'm still reminded of the days
Where I turned my back on you
And told you we should go our sepraet ways
We'll I was wrong
For far to long
And now I've learned to never walk away
To never walk away

You've shown me life from diffrent eyes
What I'll never see the thing that you see
No matter how hard I try
So I let go
Lose control and grab onto the hand that holds the wold
That holds the world

(When I fade away!)
When I See your face I can feel your
I start to fade
(When I fade away!)
When I See your face I can feel your
I start to fade

When I fade away from where I want to be
I can feel there's something diffrent burning inside of me
When I fade away from where I want to be
I can feel there's something diffrent burning inside of me

(When I fade away!)
When I See your face I can feel your
I start to fade
(When I fade away!)
When I See your face I can feel your
I start to fade

I fade away from myself---Lyrics submitted by Drake.
