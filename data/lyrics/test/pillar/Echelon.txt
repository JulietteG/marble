You know it's time 
For us to step it up
Another level now 
'Cause we finished warming up
So we rise up elevate 
To maintain fill up with octane
And fan the flame we regain all the names
The enemy took away

And like a green beret we will lead the way
Into battle so have no fear 
We will draw near
So that we can persevere 

Like a gondolier
We headed straight to the top 
Nonstop Set shop at the top of the Rock
You'll feel the aftershock after we rock the spot
Cause you forgot these soldiers won't turn and walk
We take hard knocks 
Come back for more
Cause we're hardcore 
We fight for the One who died for (you)
And like Saigon we're on the frontlines
And we carry on to the end times

Now that it's on
We're out in the front of this marathon
With our armor on 
Stay strong we drive on (drive on)
Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
And you know we don't stop 
Now that it's on

We're out in the front of this marathon
With our armor on 
Stay strong we drive on (drive on)
Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
And you know we don't stop (our echelon)
Now that it's on 

We're on the enemy's hit list
I'm hopin' you get this
You're takin' a risk 
When you resist the one who made you exist
Evolutionists 
We got love for you too 
But we're breakin' down walls 
Seeking out the truth

I'm a soldier in this army of One
Like I told ya the battle's already won
So about face 
Move outta the way 
I gotta pray for you
And this is how we do

Now that it's on
We're out in the front of this marathon
With our armor on 
Stay strong we drive on (drive on)
Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
And you know we don't stop 
Now that it's on

We're out in the front of this marathon
With our armor on 
Stay strong we drive on (drive on)
Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
And you know we don't stop (our echelon)
Now that it's on 




Now that it's on
We're out in the front of this marathon
With our armor on 
Stay strong we drive on 
Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
And you know we don't stop 
Now that it's on

We're out in the front of this marathon
With our armor on 
Stay strong we drive on (drive on)
Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
And you know we don't stop
Now that it's on 

We're out in the front of this marathon
With our armor on 
Stay strong we drive on (drive on)
Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
And you know we don't stop (our Echelon)
Now that it's on

We're out in the front of this marathon
With our armor on 
Stay strong we drive on (drive on)
Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top
And you know we don't stop (our echelon)
Now that it's on
