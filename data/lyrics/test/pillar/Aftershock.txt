It's plain to see that all you care about
Are the pockets that you fill
You don't want to hear me talk about
The reasons that we're here
I don't know if I can go without
Even if you lock me down
I don't care how much you scream and shout
I'll never be part of the crowd

And I will make a sound
I will let my voices out
I cant let my spirt break
We're never gonna be the same

So break all these chains that keep me bound
And break through these gates that lock me down
So break all these chains that keep me bound
And break through these gates that lock me down

I can't even feel a little pain
No matter what you do to me
And you will ever hear my heart complain
No matter what you think you see

And I will make a sound
Will I can't let my spirt break

So break all these chains that keep me bound
And break through these gates that lock me down
So break all these chains that keep me bound
And break through these gates that lock me down

*Whispering*

So break all these chains that keep me bound
And break through these gates that lock me down
So break all these chains that keep me bound
And break through these gates that lock me down
break through these gates that lock me down
break through these gates---Lyrics submitted by Drake.
