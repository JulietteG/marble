I am like a little a bitter sweet pie!
Filled with love, and also denial,
When you're not around, everything goes down
Everything goes wrong with me!
When you're not around, everything goes down
Why in hell you cannot see?

I can feel your love is real,
But I know that you're making me sick!
Oh, you're serving me, your poison meal,
And I know that you're making me sick! (x2)

I think I met him, I think I met him!
I think I m-m-m-m-met him!
I think I met him, I think I met him!
I think I m-m-m-m-met him!
Why don't you, ohh oh ohhhh...

You are like a bitter sweet pie!
But you are filled with cream and a cherry top lie!
When you're not around, everything goes down
Everything goes wrong with me!
When you're not around, everything goes down
Why in hell you cannot see?

I can feel your love is real,
But I know that you're making me sick!
Are you serving me, the boys and me?
And I know that you're making me sick! (x2)

I think I met him, I think I met him!
I think I m-m-m-m-met him!
I think I met him, I think I met him!
I think I m-m-m-m-met him!
Why don't you...?---Lyrics submitted by Kekse.
