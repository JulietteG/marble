Pride is weighing me down
It's choking my heart
I'm chained up and bound
If pride is my prison
Then Grace be my key
Sweet Holy Spirit
Come rescue me

Spirit Spirit I surrender
Spirit Spirit I submit to you now
Spirit Spirit I surrender
Spirit sweet Holy Spirit

You know for so long I was a drowning man
I was hopeless and lost at sea yes I was
But Lord you threw me a line
Brought me back to your shore
Now I can feel the light from your lighthouse
Shining down on me yes I can

Worry oh what can I say
I've worried so much
I forget how to pray
Well I'm down on my knees
And this is coming from my soul
Sweet Holy Spirit
Come make me whole---Lyrics submitted by Megan Erickson.
