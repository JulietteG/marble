When the stars came crashing down
In tiny pieces to the ground
I was all alone down here
Trapped beneath the atmosphere
Then I, thought somebody called my name
I spun around and caught a flame
I gave into a God I didnt know
And now everything is falling into place
A brand new life is calling and I owe it all to grace

Its so much brighter living in your world
Savior, what you did for me
You gave me something I want everyone to see
When we struggle and it all goes wrong
Only you can make it right
So I say
Oh oh oh oh oh
Im learning to be the light
whoa, whoa
Im learning to be the light
whoa, whoa

When a heart is cold as ice
You cant melt it with advice
No one wants to listen to
A list of things they shouldnt do
So I build a city on a hill
And I light a candle on the sill
Knowing youll be always knocking at the door
Oh God I just want to love on everyone
All I have is yours to give so let the people come

Its so much brighter living in your world
Savor what you did for me
You gave me something I want everyone to see
When we struggle and it all goes wrong
Only you can make it right
So I say
Oh oh oh oh oh
Im learning to be the light
whoa, whoa
Im learning to be the light
whoa, whoa
Im learning to be the light

that makes the shadows hide
the light that breaks the curse of pride
the light that takes the weary in its arms

When it all came crashing down
There was only darkness all around
But in the distance I could see
A Flame

Its So much brighter living in your world
Savior what you did for me
You gave me something I want everyone, I mean everyone to see
When we struggle and it all goes wrong
Only you can make it right
So I say
Oh oh oh oh oh
Im learning to be the light
whoa, whoa
Im learning to be the light
whoa, whoa
Im learning to be the light
whoa, whoa
Im learning to be the light
whoa, whoa
Im learning to be the light!!---Lyrics submitted by Dori Bramwell.
