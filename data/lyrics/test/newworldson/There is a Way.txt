You say love is just a word,
just four letters in a row.
Just a thing that people say,
or they never tell you so.
And you use every excuse, to let nobody in.
Now this cloud you bring around, has become your only friend.
And everybody saying that it's going to go away,
But it dont go.
And everybody's telling you one day it's going to change,
But you don't know.
If it's really going to end.
Chorus:
But there is a way,
There is a spark,
There is a hope that you can hold on to.
There is a life line come to the rescue,
Just like a hand that's waiting for you.
And if you believe in this I promise that you won't be alone.
There is a way, the truth and the life, and the way.
What if love became a man, If the word had flesh and bone.
Would you recognize his face, If he came to bring you home?
You think you're all alone, Gotta do it on your own riding solo.
Is there someone you can call when you stumble and fall? Cause you don't know, If you'll be getting up again.

Back to Chorus

Don't you think your life's worth saving? Don't you know that love's amazing?
Don't you want to lay your troubles down?
Lay them down.
If I thought love was just a word,
I might feel the same way too.
But theres so much more than that,
And it's waiting here for you.

Back to Chorus.

There is a way,
There is a way!
There is a way.
Come on, there is a way.
There is a way,
There is a way, truth and the life, and the way.---Lyrics submitted by Timothy.
