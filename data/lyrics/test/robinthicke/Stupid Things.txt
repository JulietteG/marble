Just charge it to my account
I hope i haven't gone over my limit
With interest rates so swift
No need to scream and shout
No doubt if women are from Venus now
I'll get to them some how

All i wanna do is please you
Please myself by living my life too
And all the stupid things i do
Have absolutely no reflection on how i feel about you

Oh yes i recall
Skipping on breakfast to play basketball
Then feeling two feet small
Sometimes you read like William Shakes
Your scent is sweet like Betty Crocker bakes
I'd love to have your cake and eat it too

All i wanna do is please you
Please myself by living my life too
All the stupid things i do
Have absolutey no reflection on how i feel about you
How i feel about you, yeah---Lyrics submitted by kia.
