(w/ Ron Burgundy)

(Intro)
Oh my God this is something
Hold on everybody
Here we go
Not quite yet
Put this in
This with Robin Thicke
Any minute now
Alright
Here we go
Take it away

(Verse)
It is the night
My bodys weak
Im on the run, no time to sleep
Ive got to ride, ride like the wind
To be free again

(Chorus)
And Ive got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

(Verse)
I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

(Chorus)
And Ive got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Gonna ride like the wind

(Verse)
Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

(Verse)
It is the night
My bodys weak
Im on the run, no time to sleep
Ive got to ride, ride like the wind
To be free again

(Chorus x2)
And Ive got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I ride ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Gonna ride like the wind

(Interlude)
thats right folks
When Ron Burgundy rides, he rides like the wind
Not like a Subaru or a golf cart
Like the god dong wind
Powerful and slick and invisible
Feel that draft up yo skirt ladies?
Thats me
Okay that was creepy, Im sorry
I smoked a funny cigarette with this Robin Thicke guy and lets just say the filter is off
I feel like Ive gone on too long
Let me hit you with this
Flee the palace nigga
Bowes of my sweet breath

Ride like the wind (x6)

(Outro)
That was a blast, Robin
Wanna get a drink?
Whered he go?
Oh he just left?
Well its fine, I have plenty to do
Plenty!
I dont need to hang out with Robin Thicke
Hey yo, sound engineer, do you wanna get a beer?
No? youre good?
Oh okay
Good because I dont want one either
Alright
But I do need a ride home
Its alright, Ill take that stranger
Okay
Who turned the lights off?
Let me get out of the recording booth at least
Im locked in here
Excuse me, Im locked in here
Why is the song still going? Im locked in the booth
Oh my gosh, I cant breathe anymore
Theres a lack of oxygen here
I dont wanna die like this
No, Ive too much to live for
I dont wanna die like this
Never mind, the door was stuck
Im good
Alright, bye bye
Heh, Im saying goodbye to no one
Bye---
