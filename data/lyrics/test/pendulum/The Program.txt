Shotta, hitter, serial killer
Go-a your funeral and all drink out your liquor
When you are bury we a-stand next to vicar
Fling on some dirt and make your bury a little quicker
Shouldn't test the youth them in the Tommy Hilfiger
Hug up ya mama, say sorry to ya poppa
All-a get number for ya little sister
I true be cold like Alaska freezer

Ask fe me style ask fe me slogan
One black me seh pon dem program
Ask fe me style ask fe me slogan
Again an' again an' again an' again
Run down me lyrics like it name Bin Laden
In de dance and nuh beg nu pardon
Tek up fe me lyrics and dem train and practice
Go in de dance like a dem one make it

Ask fe me style ask fe me slogan
One black me seh pon dem program
Ask fe me style ask fe me slogan
Again an' again an' again an' again
Run down me lyrics like it name Bin Laden
