Well it's been such a long time coming
I thought you'd understand
That's over
Ahead of the lines
You'll be joining in the sand

Is it simple?
You were wrong
You must have known that we live down below

I know you thought I'd sold my soul
But you never told me to my face
I just had to leave you go
Blow this shit away!

Here we go again...---Lyrics submitted by lucas.
