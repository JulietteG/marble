You're alive like a waited Fuck
The hidden passenger that I've been taking
close your eyes and wave back again
As you drag me down I will take you in

What are you waiting for as you cut me down tonight
What are you waiting for as we go towards the light

When everything is said and done
Give me the answer the only one
Everything is dead and cold
Give me a reason for what I've done---Lyrics submitted by Francesco.
