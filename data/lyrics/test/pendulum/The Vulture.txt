It's the rise of the vulture
I feel the panic
All those who are nervous,
We've lost the dynamic
Your bloods been poisoned
When your high as a tower
Hear the sound of the war drums
We're taking the power!

(We're taking your power)
We're taking the power!
(we're taking your power)


It's the rise of the vulture
Gotta' keep on climbing
No chance to escape
No use in hiding
You see the eye of the storm
With a silver lining
To the point where it breaks
Gotta' keep on grinding

(We're taking your power)
We're taking the power!
(We're taking your power)

Under force, under pressure
Under force, under pressure

We're taking the power!
(We're taking your power)
We're taking the power!
(We're taking your power)

We're taking the power!
(We're taking your power)
We're taking the power!
(We're taking your power)---Lyrics submitted by Gareth.
