Uh, Pain
Uh, Pain
Uh, Pain
Uh

So there you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds, some body shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who youd call when no one else around

Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action

You know, You know

Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action

The future will be televised, haters getting genocide
23 and 43, Im talkin my more jealous sides
My niggas is hella fly, you over accessorize
Better not, its in my repertoire, forever ever high
I never lie, never tell a lie, I would testify
Set aside dreams, Im a king ask Aretha Scott
Two faced, bad ass, in a nice set of thighs
We on the weed, I need a umbrella ella ella ah

Everybody knows me
Shit, still aint got no cash
Bitch, get that glass quick
Post my bad habits
Fuck you and your Instagram
Match around man though
Royal blue folls, getting head in the red Lambo
Media take me out, TMZ all in the VIP
Bitch Im hard and my lube come free
Too much boss if you ask me
Almost fucked fame, but she came with money
I got two bad bitches, haters wanna take em from me

Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action

Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, Lights, camera, action

Tryina get on in this industry
Acting like your birthday
Breaking down cocaine with the EBT
These male groupies doing it
However, whatever they seeing on the box
Everybody spit, everybody hide, everybody anonymous
SOLOST, niggas talking dollars getting change
In a minute Imma lose 2 scrit
Well one, give the full 98
Like fuck coach, Im cutthroat
So what ghost? Do you head for the year they say might be the end?
Better look within
Uh

Glisten the glamors, we pose for the cameras
Get all niggas with me, they pose with the hammers
Ghetto goes with me, pimp toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my Henny boy
Clothes in my hand boy, that baby need camouflage
Rims from the pen, you would think I was a samurai
Drop rocks, bloomy scott pens, bitch its hammer time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized

Life is what you need, wont you take a Z? Feel the breeze
Smoke the Sour Deeze, hit that shit and please act at ease
Wouldnt you wanna be like the Black Eyed Peas, all these 3s
STAR, thats Hollywood, wont you rest in peace?

So figure up, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds, some fighters shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who youd call when no one else around---Lyrics submitted by jessi edmond.
