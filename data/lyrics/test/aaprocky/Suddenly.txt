[Verse 1]
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But Im pimpin nigga, Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone thugs had more thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
Wassup, whats on your mind? Hol up, Im feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thuggin like Im Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess thats why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches aint respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fist fights
And fish fries and shootouts like one SIG with two rounds
And click left two down, thats four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitch
Thats everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Dont view me as no conscious cat, this aint no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my macll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook, connect, named Sosa, Spanish chick by Ola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
Im bout it bout it, nigga aint shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speakin bout me
Im so thuggish ruggish bringin ruckus, knuckin if you buckin
Young and thuggin, buggin showing out in public, but you love it

[Bridge]
I only got one vision, thats for kids in every color, religion
That listen, that you gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all got children and siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

[Verse 2]
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend,
Then a nigga smash, Ill be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the Lac when I spin,
Then its back to the back of the Benz,
Lean back in the back with the Henn
And a crap when I tap that that then attack,
Never tax, never that that, max on the ends
Spend ends, I remember way back when,
A motherfucker used to have to borrow cash from my friends, friends
Just to put a snack up in the fridge
When Im on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me, them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say whats up to me, from ugly to comfortably
Suddenly

[Outro]
It all changed man
It was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly
And now Im comfortable
I just only can thank God
Suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes
By my surprise
