I'm thinking it through
I'm thinking of you
Try to remind myself to move
The nightmare unfolds
Should have never let her go
Alone in this empty room
Let it burn

I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking it through
I try to remind myself to move
I wait by the phone
You're never coming home

Let it burn, let it bleed
Let it go that Sunday morning
I don't understand
Just give her one more chance
May angels keep her safe tonight
I'm doing all I can
Let it burn

It was a cold winter's day
The streets were wet with rain
Another drink, one for the ride
He turned the key
And started to drive
I wish I never let her go
I wish I could just push rewind
So young and so alive

Let it burn, let it bleed
Let it go that Sunday morning
I don't understand
Just give her one more chance
May angels keep her safe tonight
I'm doing all I can
Let it burn

Let it burn, let it bleed
But this time I pierced my heart
Beneath my skin
Let it burn, let it bleed
What a price, life torn apart
From one man's sin

I don't understand
Just give her one more chance
May angels keep her safe tonight
I'm doing all I can
Let it burn---Lyrics submitted by pero.
