(Verse)
Got a story about a Cinderella
Pretty lady lady lady
Working night by every day 
Pretty lady lady lady
She was on her high like a sunrise
Beautiful moon on a clean light
Full of light like a shooting star ray
Till the day that daddy gave her away

(Verse)
Hey lady didn't complain
Tought she was better off in a sway so
Strong, but she was so wrong
Bitter for a figure
Now shes on the run
Lady didn't understand,No
Tought she was queen of the ghetto
But everything she had only was blown mad
Didnt force her family to call her
No no

(Chorus)
I never knew a love like this one before
Cause it can't be compared with anyone
There's no one doubt and no feels from the hearts
When it's love you will know from the start
The start the start
It's from the start
It's all in your heart

(Verse)
Gina o so piesa miento
El e la siense canda secreto
De sus promesas
Te cuvrileto de su misterio
De cuando vesa
Yo pi muera de mi mocheta
Loke yo siento
Des de 
Comienso

(Chorus)
I never knew a love like this one before
She never knew a love like this
'Cause it can't be compared with anyone
Say it can't be compared to anyone
There's no one doubt and no feel from the hearts
No shadow of a doubt
When it's love you will know from the start
The start the start
It's from the start
It's all in your heart
She had it from the start
She knew it from the start

(Verse)
Start
Rewind it from the scrap
Where a heart skips a beat
No DJ could ever drop
Love's all gone , it's nowhere near
Out in the open still she choking on air
Before sad moves in she comes clear
It aint easy to let go a certain sincere
She's at a point where she really don't care
To deal with love who had lock her up

(Chorus)
I never knew a love like this one before
Say she never knew a love like this
'Cause it can't be compared with anyone
Anyone
There's no one doubt and no feel from the hearts
When it's love you will know from the start
The start the start
It's from the start
The Start, The Start

(Outro)
In a heart where's there true love
There's no doubt
When it's love you'll know
It's from the start
From the start---Lyrics submitted by Borre.
