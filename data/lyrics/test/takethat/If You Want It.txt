If you want it
You can have it
You can have it
If you want it
If you want it
Come and get it
Come and get it
If you want it

You said it
I thought it
And felt it
We meant it
But it's never going to happen if we're waiting for it

The cracks
Imperfection
In hindsight
Our vision
But it's never going to happen if we're waiting for it

If you want it
You can have it
You can have it
If you want it
If you want it
Come and get it
Come and get it
If you want it

Every day we get a little bit closer
Every day we get a little bit louder
Every day we get a little bit
Yeah I know, I know
Every day could be a little bit brighter
Every day could be a little bit higher
Every day could be a little bit
Yeah I know, I know
It's never gonna happen if we're waiting for it

If you want it
You can have it
You can have it
If you want it

My shouting
Your calling
No siren
No warning
But it's never gonna happen if we're waiting for it

Infectious
Your being
Ignited
I'm feeling
But it's never gonna happen if we're waiting for it

Oh I think I'm moving up, yeah
Hope you get enough, yeah
We could go so far

Every day we get a little bit closer
Every day we get a little bit louder
Every day we get a little bit
Yeah I know, I know
Every day could be a little bit brighter
Every day could be a little bit higher
Every day could be a little bit
Yeah I know, I know
But it's never gonna happen if we're waiting for it

If you want it
You can have it (it's never gonna happen if we're waiting for it)
You can have it
If you want it
If you want it
Come and get it
Come and get it
If you want it

Won't you peel away my skin, yeah
Let it all begin, yeah
'Til you reach my heart
I think I'm moving up, yeah
Hope you get enough, yeah
We could go so far

Every day we get a little bit closer
Every day we get a little bit closer

Every day we get a little bit closer
Every day we get a little bit louder
Every day we get a little bit
Yeah I know, I know
Every day could be a little bit brighter
Every day could be a little bit higher
Every day could be a little bit
Yeah I know, I know
But it's never going to happen if we're waiting for it

If you want it
You can have it (no it's never going to happen if we're waiting for it)
You can have it
If you want it (it's never going to happen if we're waiting for it)
If you want it
Come and get it
Come and get it
If you want it---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
