I used to be broken
Stuck in a cage
I used to be low down
I couldnt be saved
Now I feel like a lion
That cannot be tamed
Cause you brought me back to life, to life again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now youre with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(Youre lifting me up)
If you werent, you werent here
Id be on the ground
If you werent, you werent here
Id be out of my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(Youre lifting me up)
If you werent, you werent here
Id be lost in the fire
If you werent, you werent here
Couldnt open up my eyes
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(Youre lifting me up)

The sky is a long way
When covered in rain
You gave me my vision
You gave me my faith
And now Im a fighter
I found the flame
You set me alight, alight again

I was fearless but so easily
I let life fade away the colour of my dreams
Now youre with me, I know I can be
Higher, higher than higher

(Youre lifting me up)
If you werent, you werent here
Id be on the ground
If you werent, you werent here
Id be out of my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(Youre lifting me up)
If you werent, you werent here
Id be lost in the fire
If you werent, you werent here
Couldnt open up my eyes
Cos you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher
(Youre lifting me up)

Just one way for us now
Theres no coming down
Youve brought me back to life
So Im gonna go up
Higher, higher than higher
Higher than higher, higher than higher

(Youre lifting me up)
Cause you are, you are here
I got my feet off the ground
Cause you are, you are here
Still losing my mind
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher, higher than higher

Cause you are, you are here
Now Ive found the fire
Cause you are, you are here
I can open up my eyes
Cause you are, you are here
I can be higher
Higher than higher
Higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher
Youre lifting me up
Higher, higher than higher
Higher, higher than higher---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
