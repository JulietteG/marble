If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - do you really love life?
Do you really love life?
Do you really love life, do you really love life?

Hard up, cut me up
Good day, out of luck
My bones set in stone
Dear Lord, take me home
Crowd surf, out of bounds
Drink till we're falling down
Made up that you came
Big dreams till the end
Some say we came out of the sea long time ago it's true
I come out of the ocean
To make my peace with you
I'm only fighting for you girl
I'm only fighting for the world
Before they bring me down
Out of Heaven, to the ground

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - do you really love life?
Do you really love life?

Forward, sweep me up
High tide, good enough
Sad face, when we're low
Always, step to the right
Amen, ready made
Bad dreams, out again
Fireworks, good to know
Today's the start of the weekend

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - do you really love life?
Do you really love life?

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - do you really love life?
Do you really love life?

What a way, what a way, what a way to go
Maybe something, maybe nothing, but it's all I know
What a way, what a way, what a way to go
Giving all my love
What a way, what a way, what a way to go
Maybe something, maybe nothing, but it's all I know
What a way, what a way, what a way to go
Give you all my love

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - do you really love life?
Do you really love life?

If I die now before I wake up
Ask myself - did I give enough love?
Looking in when you're on the outside
Ask yourself - do you really love life?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
