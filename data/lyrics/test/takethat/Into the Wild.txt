[VERSE]
Take my hand and let go,
I just want you to know,
You're the only one that pulls me in, 
You changed everything.

Like one small shaft of light,
Flooding into my eyes,
I will never see things just the same, 
But I'm not afraid...

And all I have, doesn't seem so significant, 
And at the drop of a hat, 
I could leave almost everything,
That I've ever known, so here we go...

[CHORUS]
Step out into the wild, 
There's a beautiful storm in your eyes, 
We're perfectly intertwined 
And if it's quite alright, 
You could be my way of life.

[VERSE]
Sea salt sits on your lips, 
Birds fall earthward from cliffs,
Thought I couldn't do this but I'm fine, 
'cause you're by my side.

And all I have, it doesn't seem so significant 
And at the drop of a hat, 
My whole world's getting different, 
So here we go, off road. 

[CHORUS]
Won't you step out into the wild, 
There's a beautiful storm in your eyes, 
We're perfectly intertwined 
And if it's quite alright maybe it's time to 
Step out into the wild, 
There's a beautiful storm in your eyes, 
We're perfectly intertwined and if it's quite alright, 
You could be my way of life.

[MIDDLE 8]
And we take another step into the truly unknown, 
Don't know why but it's somewhere that we have to go 
And it's dangerously wonderful 
So come on, come on, come on, come on...

[CHORUS]
Won't you step out into the wild, 
There's a beautiful storm in your eyes, 
We're perfectly intertwined 
And if it's quite alright, 
You could be my way of life---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
