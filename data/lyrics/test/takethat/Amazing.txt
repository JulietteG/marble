Nobody knows if I told you youd laugh out loud
If you heard her voice calling your name youd never be the same
Nothing was new and nowhere was safe and sound
And then she arrived, oh just in time to save this heart of mine
Oh, Id waited all my life

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My heads in the clouds Im no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing

Maybe she knows, and maybe shell soon be mine
In a perfect world, you know that this girl would be right here tonight
Weighing heavy on my mind

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My heads in the clouds Im no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing

Maybe my heart and my head are colliding
Or maybe its more than I dare to believe
Dont ever let me forget what Im feeling
Or wake up to find that its all just a dream

All I know is
Nobody knows it feels so amazing
And nobody else got my story to tell
My heads in the clouds that Im no longer chasing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing
And nobody knows that it feels so amazing---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
