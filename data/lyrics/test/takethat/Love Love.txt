You bring me right back down to 
the earth from the promise land
We're getting close to the centre of
the earth with an honest plan
You'll never be your mother or your 
father do your understand
you understand

We don't have too much time here
And time it travels far too fast
We're not too far we're too near
Before they take it from our hands


Why don't you teach your heart to feel
And give you love love 
Give you love love 
Give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to talk 
And give you love love 
Give you love love 
Give me give me what i need

We'll take you right back down 
to the earth from the mother land
This is a first class journey 
from the gods to the son of man
You're at the gates of human
evolution don't you understand
Why don't you understand
Understand

We don't have too much time here
And time it travels far too fast
We're not too far we're too near
Before they take it from our hands


Why don't you teach your heart to talk 
And give you love love 
Give you love love 
Give it all away

We don't have too much time here
And time it travels far too fast
We're not too far we're too near
Before they take it from our hands


Why don't you teach your heart to talk 
And give you love love 
Give you love love 
Give it all away
Why don't you teach your heart to talk 
And give you love love 
Give you love love 
Give me give me what i need---Lyrics submitted by Chuck Noris.
