Standing on the edge of forever,
At the start of whatever,
Shouting love at the world.
Back then we were like cavemen,
But we map the moon and the stars,
Then we forgave them.

We will meet you where the lights are,
The defenders, of the faith we are.
Where the thunder turns around theyll run so hard well tear the ground away.

You know no one dies, in these love drowned eyes,
Through our love drowned eyes, well watch you sleep tonight.

Although no one understood we were holding back the flood,
Learning how to dance the rain.
We were holding back the flood they said wed never dance again.

Bleeding, but none of us leaving,
Watch your mouth son or youll find yourself floating home.
Here we come now on a dark star, seeing demons, not what we are.
Tiny minds and eager hands will try to strike but now will end today.

Theres progress now where there once was none, where there once was none, then everything came along
Although no one understood, we were holding back the flood learning how to dance the rain.
There was more of them than us now theyll never dance again.

Although no one understood there was more of them than us learning how to dance the rain,
We were holding back the flood they said wed never dance again.

We will meet you where the lights are,
The defenders, of the faith we are.
Where the thunder turns around theyll run so hard well tear the ground away.

Although no one understood, there was more of them than us learning how to dance the rain.
(learning how to dance the rain)
There was more of them than us now theyll never dance again.

Now well never dance again.

Oh ahh, Oh ahh, Oh ahh, Oh ahh, Oh aah, Oh ahh, Oh ahh... ---Lyrics submitted by Ethan Ainge.
