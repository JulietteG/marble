In this town,
All streets lead to sea.
All girls and boys
Leave by A.M 3

In this toen,
All the rooftops glimmer.
All the engines stop,
You hear the silence of your lover.

In this Town,
We have no sympathy     

In this Town,
We have no sympathy     

We have no sympathy

In this town,
All streets lead to sea.
All girls and boys
Leave by A.M 3

In this toen,
All the rooftops glimmer.
All the engines stop,
You hear the silence of your lover.

In this Town,
We have no sympathy     

In this Town,
We have no sympathy     

We have no sympathy---Lyrics submitted by Emirhan.
