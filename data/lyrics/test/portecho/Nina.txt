Baby whales are sailing the sea,
They'd love to catch a glimmpse of thee
Hundreds of miles they traveled along with me.

A mountain lies under the moon
My curious eyes will be over you soon
Trembeling trees have been watching you wait in gloom

Whispering on celluloid leaves
I'm crafting my lullaby

Blimps and kites are clouding the skies
You and I are clinging from stars
Clusters of comets are whirling before our eyes

Whispering on celluloid leaves
I'm crafting my lullaby

Clusters of comets are whirling before our eyes (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Emirhan.
