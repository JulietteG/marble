With morning light,
Comes new born star.
Drifting high,
Fireworks and the kites.

Our time has come.
The end is nigh.

Don't think you are
One of the kind.

Dazed and drowned
Far from skies
Drifting high,
Fireworks and the kites.

Our time has come 
The end is nigh
So don't think you are,
Dont think you are
One of the kind.

Don't think you are
Don't think you are
One of the kind.

One of the kind. (x4)

Our time has come 
The end is nigh

Our time has come 
The end is nigh

Our time has come 
(One of the kind)
The end is nigh
(One of the kind)

Our time has come 
(One of the kind)
The end is nigh
(One of the kind)

Our time has come 
(One of the kind)
The end is nigh
(One of the kind)---Lyrics submitted by Emirhan.
