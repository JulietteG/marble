I pray you'll be our eyes
And watch us where we go
And help us to be wise
In times when we don't know

Let this be our prayer
When we lose our way
Lead us to a place
Guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe

I pray we'll find your light
And holds it in our hearts
When stars go out each night
Remind us where you are

Let this be our prayer
When shadows fill our day
Lead us to a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

A world where pain and sorrow will be ended
And every heart that's broken will be mended
And we'll remember we are all gods children
Reaching out to touch you
Reaching to the stars

We ask that life be Kind
And watch us from above
We hope each soul will find
Another soul to love

Let this be your prayer
Just like every child
Needs to find a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

Needs to find a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
