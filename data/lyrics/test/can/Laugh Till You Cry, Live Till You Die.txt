Na, na, na, na, na, na, Na, na, na, na, na, na, Na, na, na, na, na, na, Na, na, na, na, na, na.

Laugh till you cry, live till you die, Laugh till you cry, live till you die, Laugh till you cry, live till you die, Laugh till you cry, live till you die.

What's enough for me Is too much for another, Just to treat my safe alarm, I need you for my lover.

It isn't far, so far away, The future is diminished, The night is really over, The past is all just finished.

Let's make it in my memories, Maybe you will see That if I want to hear you fool Why don't you take me here?

Laugh till you cry, live till you die, Laugh till you cry, live till you die.

Laugh till you cry, live till you die, Live till you die. Na, na, na, na, na, na, laugh till you cry, Na, na, na, na, na, na, live till you die. Na, na, na, na, na, na, laugh till you cry, live till you die, Na, na, na, na, na, na, laugh till you cry, live till you die.

Taking in my confidence, Waiting for the time, The world was over yesterday, I take my head and cry.

Laugh till you cry, live till you die ---Lyrics submitted by willy.
