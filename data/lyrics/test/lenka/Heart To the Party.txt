Ones, i will come i could see the dreams is real
Ones, i will come i could see the dreams is real

The Keep and the Larc'
And then all will like and fell

Was the moon shine and bright on in midnight dream?
And them sailing along on the deep blue sea?

So,
Bring your heart to the party
i wanna' dance all night
to the darkness daring

Bring your heart to the party
i wanna' dance like i hope
tommorow the knight will come
and fall like a star
and know the times is gone

as it feels true the ever at all the way
and them sayin' " The bright far the shine and day "

Just close you eyes,
it will be alright
Just close your eyes..

and,
Bring your heart to the party
i wanna' dance all night
to the darkness daring

Bring your heart to the party
i wanna' dance all night
to the darkness daring

Bring your heart to the party
i wanna' dance all night
to the darkness daring
daring, daring, daring, daring..---Lyrics submitted by Bagas Mahardika.
