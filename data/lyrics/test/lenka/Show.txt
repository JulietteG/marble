i'm just a little bit caught in the middle
life is a maze and love is a riddle
i don't know where to go, can't do it alone, i've tried and i don't know why.

slow it down,
make it stop,
or else my heart is going to pop
coz it's to much, yea it's alot, to be something i'm not.
i'm a fool, outta love, coz i just can't get enough.

i'm just a little bit caught in the middle
life is a maze and love is a riddle
i don't know where to go, can't do it alone, i've tried and i don't know why.
i'm just a little girl lost in the moment
i'm so scared but i don't show it
i can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
i know, i got to let it go
and just enjoy the show.

the sun is hot, in the sky
just like a giant spotlight.
the people follow a sign and schyncronise in time
it's a joke, nobody knows, they got a ticket to the show.

yer, i'm just a little bit caught in the middle
life is a maze and love is a riddle
i don't know where to go, can't do it alone, i've tried and i don't know why.
i'm just a little girl lost in the moment
i'm so scared but i don't show it
i can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
i know, i got to let it go
and just enjoy the show.

oh oh
just enjoy the show
oh oh

i'm just a lttle bit caught in the middle
life is a maze and love is a riddle
i don't know where to go, can't do it alone, i've tried and i don't know why.
i'm just a little girl lost in the moment
i'm so scared but i don't show it
i can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
i know, i got to let it go
and just enjoy the show.

dum de dum, de dum de dum, just enjoy the show
dum de dum, de dum de dum, just enjoy the show

i want my money back, i want my money back, i want my money back
just enjoy the show.
i want my money back, i want my money back, i want my money back
just enjoy the show.---Lyrics submitted by alysha.
