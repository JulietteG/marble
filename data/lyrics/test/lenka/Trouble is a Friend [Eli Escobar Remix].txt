Trouble will you find you no matter where you go ohh ohh ..
No matter if you fast no matter if you slow ohh ohh ..
The eye of the storm and the cry in the morn ohh ohh ..
Your fine for a while but you start to lose control ohh ohh ..

He is there in the dark 
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds 
He's got to play a part 
Trouble is a friend yeah 
Trouble is a friend of my mine ohh ohh ..

Trouble is a friend but trouble is a foe ohh ohh ..
No matter what i feed him he always seems to grow ohh ohh ..
He's sees what i sees and he knows what i know ohh ohh ..
So don't forget as you ease on the my rob ohh ohh ...

He is there in the dark 
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds 
He's got to play a part 
Trouble is a friend yeah 
Trouble is a friend of my mine ohh ohh ..

So i don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm 
I won't let him win cause i'm the sucker for his charm 
Trouble is a friend yeah 
Trouble is a friend of my mine ohh ohh ..

How I hates the way he makes me feel ..
And how I tried to make him leave 
I tried ohh ohh I tried ..

But he's there in the dark 
He's there in my heart 
He waits in the winds 
he's got to play a part 
Trouble is a Friend yeah 
Trouble is a friend of my mine ohh ohh ..

So i don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm 
I won't let him win cause i'm the sucker for his charm 
Trouble is a friend yeah 
Trouble is a friend of my mine ohh ohh ..
