You stay just where you are
While I'm away from home
But I take you in my heart
Just like a placebo, oh
It's not enough, no
To fill me up

I need you by my side
To speed the lonely night
Yeah, oh
Things go faster, faster with you...

And though the thread is long
That holds us together
Well it's flexible and strong
But it slows us down, oh
Time flies, it's true
But just when I'm with you

Yeah I need you by my side
To speed the lonely night
Yeah, oh
Things go faster, faster, oh

As I try... (as hard as I try...)
I can't seem to shake the feeling
That you're all that I require
And yeah so I try
To imagine that you're with me, oh

Things go faster...
Things go faster...
...Faster with you---Lyrics submitted by frosk.
