Say something, Im giving up on you
Ill the one if you want me to
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something, Im giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
Im still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, Im giving up on you
Im sorry that I couldnt get to you
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something, Im giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
Youre the one that I love
And Im saying goodbye

Say something, Im giving up on you
Im sorry that I couldnt get to you
And anywhere I would have followed you
Say something, Im giving up on you

Say something, Im giving up on you
Say something---Lyrics submitted by Lauren.
