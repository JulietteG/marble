[Instrumental]
There's a light
In the darkness
Though the night
Is black as my skin

There's a light
Burning Bright
Showin' me the way
But I know where I've been

There's a cry
In the Distance
It's a voice, that comes from deep within
There's a cry
Askin' why
I pray the answer's up ahead (yeah)
Cause I know where I've been

There's a road, we've been travelin'
Lost so many
On the way
But the riches 
Will be plenty
Worth the price 
The price we had to pay

There's a dream
With a future 
There's a struggle
That we have yet to win
And there's a cry 
In my heart
Cause I know where I'm going, yes I do
And I know where I've been yeah

(There's a road)
There's a road
(We must travel)
We must, travel
(There's a promise) 
There is a promise
(We must make)
That we must make
(But the riches)
Oh, but the riches
(Will be plenty)
The riches will be plenty, yeah
(Worth the risk)
Worth the risk
(And the chances)
And the chances we take 

There's a dream, yeah
In the future
there's a struggle,(Struggle) That we have yet to win
(We have yet to win)

Use that pride(pride)
In our hearts(In our hearts)
To lift us up(Lift us up)
Until tomorrow
Cause just to sit still would be a sin
(I know it, I know it, I know where, I'm going)

And Lord knows, I know

Where I've been 

(Oh! When we win)
I'll give thanks to my god 
Cause I know where I've been---Lyrics submitted by Your Mom.
