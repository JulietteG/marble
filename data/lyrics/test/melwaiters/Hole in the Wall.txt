Let's go baby to the hole in the wall
I've had my best time y'all at the hole in the wall

3 o'clock in the morning 
All the damn clubs are closed
I went to this place y'all 
I didn't want anyone to know
I walked into the room
Had my nose in the air
It's 7 in the morning
And I'm still in there

Let's go baby to the hole in the wall
I've had my best time y'all at the hole in the wall

I took my high class woman
With me the next night
She didn't want to get out of the car
She said it didn't look right
She walked into the room
With her nose in the air
It's 7 in the morning y'all
She's still in there

Smoke filled room 
Whiskey and chicken wings
People dancin' and drinkin'
And no one wants to leave

Let's go baby to the hole in the wall
I've had my best time y'all at the hole in the wall

Smoke filled room 
Whiskey and chicken wings
People dancin' and drinkin'
And no one wants to leave

Let's go baby to the hole in the wall
I've had my best time y'all at the hole in the wall

( i wanna go baby, can we go
To the hole in the wall
I know y'all a lot of y'all heard of that before
It's like all time of night you can hang out all night long
And i wanna go back to the hole in the wall
Somebody go with me )

Let's go baby to the hole in the wall
I've had my best time y'all at the hole in the wall

3 o'clock in the morning 
All the damn clubs are closed
I went to this place y'all 
I didn't want anyone to know
I walked into the room
Had my nose in the air
It's 7 in the morning
And I'm still in there

Let's go baby to the hole in the wall
I've had my best time y'all at the hole in the wall

Let's go baby to the hole in the wall
I've had my best time y'all at the hole in the wall---
