I fold a piece of paper
And I put it in my pocket
Cause' I'm about to board
The world's first rocket
And I need to remember
Where i came from

And I leave it for as long as i can
Until it falls and breaks
And it crumbles like sand
And we all go like

Ohh la la la oh la la la la
Oh la la la oh la la la la

Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
The rocket ship went off like a gun
It was nice knowing you my good friend
But i might never ever ever ever see you again
Eh eh eh
Know we all going oh la la la oh la la la la...

Wriggle me down to the ground and maybe one day well I'll be found
Sing it loud and the air is proud and
Maybe one day we will all be found
Singing oh la la la oh la la la la
Oh la la la oh la la la la
Oh la la la oh la la la la---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
