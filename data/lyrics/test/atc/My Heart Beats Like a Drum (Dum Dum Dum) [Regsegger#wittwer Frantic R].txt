"My Heart Beats Like A Drum (Dam Dam Dam)"

I close my eyes
Close the door
I won't worry anymore
I've been waiting for you
Everyday and everynight

Cut the light
Let it fade
I don't wanna be afraid
I've been waiting for you

Tonight it is right
Stars shine bright
I just really wanna be with you
I celebrate pray for that day
When all my wishes will be coming true

My heart beats like a drum - like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feet step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

My heart beats like a drum - like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feet step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

I think of you
Everyday
I've been waiting for a call
Just the sound of your voice
Anytime and anyway

Dream of you
Since that day
When I saw you
The first time
At the Hard Rock Cafe

Tonight it is right
Stars shine bright
I just really wanna be with you
I celebrate pray for that day
When all my wishes will be coming true

My heart beats like a drum - like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feet step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

My heart beats like a drum - like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feet step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

I close my eyes
Close the door
I won't worry anymore
I've been waiting for you

And my feet steps the beat, baby

My heart beats like a drum - like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feet step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

My heart beats like a drum - like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feet step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam---Lyrics submitted by Munira.
