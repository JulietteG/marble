Need a change
Not to imitate
But to irritate
All the ones who hate

I may be late
Always seem to get the wrong date
Well I guess it's fate

I live in a cemetery

Full of good will and integrity
You see I have no specialty

Here's your warning
I'll give you click click boom

I live in a cemetery
I need a change
Not to imitate
But to irritate

I live in a cemetery---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
