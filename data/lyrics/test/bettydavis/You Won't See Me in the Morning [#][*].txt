If I can Like ya
Oh I sure do love ya
It really aint no big thing Babay
Cuz words, they dont really matter

But If I can Say It
And you, oh you can play it
That means you dont know where Im coming from
So tell me now, how could you dig it?

Im feeling so good tonight
And you, you better hear my warning
If you dont do it do it to me right
I might not be here in the morning

If I can love ya
There aint no reason, no I cant leave ya
It really aint no big thing babay
If what Im feeling for ya dont matter to ya
And thats why, thats why you test me
You try your best to best me
You put me through a whole lot of changes
Im hoping I can keep myself together

Cuz youre feeling so good tonight
But you, you better hear my warning
If you dont give it, give it to me right
You wont feel this good in the morning


If I can Like ya
Oh I sure do love ya
But If you dont know where Im coming coming from
Tell me now, could I ever need ya?
It really aint no big thing baby
Cuz If it cant work out Ill just leave ya

I said it aint
No big thing babay

I said it aint
No big thing babay---Lyrics submitted by Jesse Cuesta.
