Put your hands together to the groove of the funky beat
You chicks and fellas dig the sound of a soul feast
Like a soul picknick
The old fashioned way
I would turn them green and candy em and dancing to the break of days

Now if you want a lot of action
I gotta see your satisfaction
Gotta be a winner
And a go getter
Gotta be a natural soul brother
A natural soul sister
A natural soul brother
A natural soul sister

It takes a lot of man clapping
To get you in the groove  
And when that feeling snapped you
Spirit makes you move
Ive got, Ive got that feeling
Moving in my bone
Today were going to see it through, if it takes all night long

Now if you want a lot of action
I gotta see your satisfaction
Gotta be a winner
And a go getter
Gotta be a natural soul brother	
A natural soul sister
A natural soul brother
A natural soul sister

Soul sister
Make it right
With a groove it cant go wrong
Im talking about the poor life
Thats my kinda carry on
I dig soul silent in the soul people I meet
Crazy 'bout the soul stealer and the soul food is all I eat

Now if you want a lot of action
I gotta see your satisfaction
Gotta be a winner    
And a go getter
Gotta be a natural soul brother
A natural soul sister
A natural soul brother
A natural soul sister---Lyrics submitted by Joline.
