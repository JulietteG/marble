From the moment I met you, girl
I knew you were for me
But there were too many distractions
And I just couldn't see

Many people try to stop me and you, baby
They say, "No way, no how"
Thought it was impossible for us to grow
But, babe, look at us now

And baby, I'll be their for you, take care of you
'Cause you're beautiful woman
Wanna give my love to you, I trust in you
'Cause you're beautiful woman

Spend the rest of my whole life, my future wife
'Cause you're beautiful woman
And it don't matter what they say I'm yours anyway
'Cause you're beautiful woman

So many people try to hate, girl
They said I was a fool
So we didn't want to rush, kept it hush, hush
Girl 'cause that was the best move

There were times that I felt you were too young
So I try to push you away, babe
But you proved to be what you're fronting?
Beyond what my words could say

And baby, I'll be their for you, take care of you
'Cause you're beautiful woman
Wanna give my love to you, I trust in you
'Cause you're beautiful woman

Spend the rest of my whole life, my future wife
'Cause you're beautiful woman
And it don't matter what they say I'm yours anyway
'Cause you're beautiful woman

Maybe we'll be together, maybe we'll last forever
Maybe you'll be my girl, I'll give you the whole world
Maybe I'll be your soldier, maybe one day I'll hold you
Maybe you'll be my lady, that way you have my, baby

Maybe we'll fall in love, give you the stars above
Maybe it's meant to be, I guess we'll just have to see
Maybe I'll be your man, maybe that's part of my plan
'Cause your beautiful woman

Baby, I'll be their for you take care of you
'Cause you're beautiful woman
Wanna give my love to you, I trust in you
'Cause you're beautiful woman

Spend the rest of my whole life, my future wife
'Cause your beautiful woman
It don't matter what they say I'm yours anyway
'Cause you're beautiful woman

My beautiful woman
