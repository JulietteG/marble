You gave your love to me
When I didn't have a thing to offer you the dreams 
And you believed, and now you think that I'm gon' dip
But I know you aint gon' trip 
Don't act like you don't know just what this is

I can tell when we kiss, when we touch, when we making sweet love
You know this thing is forever
You know the drill keep it real 
Nothing will ever come between us 
And I won't leave you never

I put that on everything I love 
I put that on my momma, baby you can trust in us 
I put that on everything I own, for all my life I promise 
That you will never be alone 
I put that on everything I am, you gotta understand 
I'll always be your man
I put that on everything I know, I never let you go
'Cause girl I love you so
I put that on:

Everything you need, I'll get it for you
A few heads I'll split 'em for you, you know I die for you
And girl you make me whole, you are my sisters soul
And you can try to act like you don't know
But, I can tell when we kiss, when we touch, when we making sweet love
You know this thing is forever
You know the drill keep it real
Nothing will ever come between us 
And I won't leave you never

Everything I need I got right here with you
You know I'm true
Don't worry baby, I will never leave you
I adore you 

And I put that on everything---Lyrics submitted by katie.
