[Verse 1:]
I'm staring at the pillow where you slept last night.
It's almost like you're still laying there.
And the shirt that you wore of mine.
Get up and threw it across the chair.
Now it's kinda hard to get you off my mind.
When I keep seeing you everywhere
For example like the lipstick on that glass of wine, damn
Sitting right over there

[Hook:]
And I can't play it off like we're friends like I used to.
No, I can't pretend like I used to.
So now I'm laying in my bed thinking about you.
And what do I do?

[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you.
Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes.
I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.
But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.
Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.
I'm coming down with a case of you

[Verse 2:]
Trying not to think about you only got me missing you more.
And loneliness ain't no cure
Thought I was over about it now
But, no not yet
Pulled the covers up to my head
Now I'm feeling dizzy, and my mouth is dry.
With just a thought of you on my mind
It's kinda crazy, what a mess I'm in
I can't believe this is happening.

[Hook:]
And I can't play it off like we're friends like I used to.
No, I can't pretend like I used to.
So now I'm laying in my bed thinking about you.
And what do I do?

[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you.
Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes.
I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.
But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.
Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.
I'm coming down with a case of you

Now this ain't no common cold
What I feel is original
And I know there is a remedy
When you bring your body back to me

[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you.
Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes.
I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.
But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.
Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.
I'm coming down with a case of you

Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with a case of you.
Now it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes.
I feel so weak, so hard to breathe.
But it seems to only happen when you leave, girl.
Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do.
I'm coming down with a case of you---Lyrics submitted by Cem.
