I know you said your ready,
but im not ready,
Marriage don't change,
Nothing but your name,
Unless it's real love,
Through the sunshine and the rain,
for better or for worse,
girl this is not a game,
See marriage dont change,
Nothing but your name.

Girl I done tried to make you understand,
That I'm proud to be with you and I'm happy I'm your man,
I know your moms and your pops wanna see you walk down that aisle,
Asking whats up, cause its been a while, bout seven years now.

We've been together baby, but girl I'm still not ready,
Take it easy dont push me away, dont wanna make a mistake,
Wanna do things right, get my baby right,
Wanna be 100%, cuz with you I wanna spend my life.

Marriage don't change,
Nothing but your name,
Unless it's real love,
Through the sunshine and the rain,
for better or for worse,
girl this is not a game,
See marriage don't change,
Nothing but your name.

Marriage don't change,
Nothing but your name,
Unless it's real love,
Through the joy and through the pain,
It's more than a ceremony, 
more than a wedding ring,
A marriage won't change,
Nothing but your name.

Ever since you caught that bouquet,
at your friends wedding day,
I've been under pressure bay,
Now you window shop for wedding gowns and wedding bands,
picking out your bridesmaids and theme song for the reception.

I know you love me baby, but girl I'm still not ready,
There's so many things, that you dont know about me,yea
Even though we've been together for so long,
We've got a long way to go, so girl lets take it slow.

Marriage don't change,
Nothing but your name,
Unless it's real love,
Through the sunshine and the rain,
for better or for worse,
girl this is not a game,
See marriage don't change,
Nothing but your name.

Marriage don't change,
Nothing but your name,
Unless it's real love,
Through the joy and through the pain,
It's more than a ceremony, 
more than a wedding ring,
a marriage won't change,
Nothing but your name.(name)

Its not that I cant see myself in love with you,
Girl I aint going nowhere, let's take our time,
This aint something that you just jump into,
And marriage dont change, no....

Marriage don't change,
Nothing but your name,
Unless it's real love,
Through the sunshine and the rain,
for better or for worse,
girl this is not a game,
See marriage don't change,
Nothing but your name.

Marriage don't change,
(Nothing but your name,)
Unless it's real love,
(Through the joy and through the pain,)
It's more than a ceremony, 
(more than a wedding ring,)
A marriage won't change,
(Nothing but your name.)

see marriage dont change, 
nothing but yo name,
unless its real love,
through the sunshine and the rain.
for better or for worse,
girl this is not a game
see marriage don't change
nothing but your name(x2)---Lyrics submitted by duncan.
