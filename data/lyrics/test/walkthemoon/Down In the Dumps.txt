I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
You can throw all your things and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring, bring me back down

Way back in '95
Scraped knees, tough love, oh yeah
Grass stains, just a sign of the times
Hey kids, look at us now
Let Maggie know gonna get under my hide

I'm gonna take control
And I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps
I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps

I walk the tight rope once
30 miles, barely made it, yeah
Scared of heights like I'm scared of falling in love

I'm gonna take control
'Cause I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps
I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps

You can throw all your things and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring, bring me back down

Think back to '95
And these arms lay creep, yeah
They'll try to kiss your childhood bye

I'm gonna take control
I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps
I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps

I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps
I said I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps

I said I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps
I said I won't let you bring me back, bring me back
Down in the dumps

You can throw all your things and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring, bring me back down

You can throw all your things and the tantrums you want
But I won't let you bring, bring me back---
