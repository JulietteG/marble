I asked you if you would come out
Out of your house, you said no
I asked you if you would come out
Give me a hug, but you said no

[Chorus]:
I'm gonna get your back anyway I can, anyway anyway I can
I'm gonna get your back anyway I can, anyway anyway I can
Kiss my face, its so good, can I kiss you back?
But you said no
Give me some, feels so bad when you take it back,
take it back.

I asked you if you were gonna make it
Make it all the way, you said no
Ooh, you said it was gonna happen
It already would have happened

[Chorus]:
I'm gonna get your back anyway I can, anyway anyway I can
I'm gonna get your back anyway I can, anyway anyway I can
Kiss my face, its so good, can I kiss you back?
But you said no
Give me some, feels so bad when you take it back,
take it back.

And I fall in love everytime, oh (x2)

I was in the street, you were in the car
I said stop, you said no
Chase you all the way to the interstate
But you don't stop, you just go. (x2)

And I fall in love everytime, oh (x2)

Frown long, I can't frown long with your face in my head
Too long, too too long since I had a smile on my head (x3)

And I fall in love everytime, oh (x2)
And I fall, I fall, fall in love everytime, oh (x4)---
