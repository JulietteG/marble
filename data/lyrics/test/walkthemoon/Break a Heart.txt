Honey youre just mine and I want you to stay
but I know youre not ready for what Im gonna say.
When youre gone Ill be fine but it wont be this good
cause I know that you love me more than you should.
Yes, I know that you love me more than you should.

So break a heart, break mine. Baby, Ill understand. 
Do your part, Ill do mine its the best chance we have.
So trust fate, trust me, trust us, just believe. 
Well get by, well get by. 
Ill give love and give blood, youll give in or give up.
But I know that you love me more than you should. 
Yes, I know.

With all of my heart I know its a good thing. 
With all of my heart I know its a good thing.
With all of my heart. No, I know.

So trust fate or trust me, trust us, just believe 
and well get by, well get by. 
And I hope that me and you to be true
aint too good. 
But I know that you love me more than you should.
Yes, I know. 

Na na na na. 
Na na na na. 
Na na na na na na na.

Yes, I know that you love me more than you should
so break a heart, break mine. Its yours, its yours.---Lyrics submitted by Pendragon.
