I know everyone you know
You know everyone I know
Our Venn diagrams are one circle

You grow up when I'm not looking
We grow apart without knowing
And all of a sudden I'm leaving

So I say I'm sorry I can't, I've got plans
'Cause I watched the time slip through my hands

But you don't know now,
One day you'll learn
Growing up is a heavy leaf to turn
A heavy leaf to turn

Take me with you
'Cause even on your own,
You are not alone

Take me with you
'Cause even by yourself, my love
You are something else

One summer turns into ten summers
One lover turns into ten lovers
But this memory is still with me

Circles bring me in circles
Your clothes underneath my clothes
Once upon a time in Portugal

So I say I'm sorry I can't, I've got plans
'Cause I watched the time slip through my hands

But you don't know now,
One day you'll learn
Growing up is a heavy leaf to turn
A heavy leaf to turn

Take me with you
'Cause even on your own,
You are not alone

Take me with you
'Cause even by yourself, my love
You are something else

No matter what you want,
Somebody else wants it just as bad
No matter what you got,
Somebody else has got it worse
No matter when I got to you,
Somebody else got to you first

So I say I'm sorry I can't, I've got plans
'Cause I watched the time slip through my hands

But you don't know now,
One day you'll learn
Growing up is a heavy leaf to turn
A heavy leaf to turn

Take me with you
'Cause even on your own,
You are not alone

Take me with you
'Cause even by yourself, my love
You are something else---
