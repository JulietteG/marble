I had a dream that we walked hand in hand
In the summer sun
You were eating a popsicle
We were having so much fun

We made out under the stars
You told me i'm the only one

So why don't you love me in real life?

Every night in my sweetest dreams
I get to hold you in my arms
I tried to get something real life, honey
But you set off your burglar alarm

Why are you calling the cops, babe?
I don't mean you any harm

Why don't you love me in real life?

(Why don't you)
Why don't you love me?
(Why don't you)
Why don't you love me in real life?
(Why don't you)
Why don't you love me?
(Why don't you)
Why don't you love me in real life?

Is it because of my mask, or just because
I'm brandishing a knife?
Why don't you love me in real life?

Every night in my sweetest dreams
I get to hold you in my arms
I tried to get something real life, honey
But you set off your burglar alarm

Why are you calling 911?
I don't mean you any harm

Why don't you love me in real life?

(Why don't you)
Why don't you love me?
(Why don't you)
Why don't you love me in real life?
(Why don't you)
Why don't you love me?
(Why don't you)
Why don't you love me in real life?

Is it because of my mask, or just because
I'm brandishing a knife?

Why don't you love me in real life? (x4)---Lyrics submitted by John Kuntis.
