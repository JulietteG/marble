Oh, how you move. 
You could have anyone.
You're just so smooth. 
Dressed to kill, Sweetheart.
You're well aware you could have anyone.
Can I have this dance right now?

CHORUS:
Girl, I'm shaking in my shoes,
Can't get away from you
while you're moving on the dance floor, 
I'm begging you for more.
(Whoa, whoa)
Just take my hand and we can shake it all night long.
When our bodies roll, 
so natural.
If only I could talk to you.

So run your fingers through your hair.
I'm only human; I can't help it.
You're my worst addiction.
I need a hit, 
a taste of midnight fix.(x2)

Oh, how you move
you could say anything.
You're just so smooth.
Dressed to kill, Sweetheart.

(CHORUS)
Just one more dance 
to get me through the night.---Lyrics submitted by Paula.
