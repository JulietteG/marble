She says she loves me, but I know she's a liar.
The sex is good, but God she's got no desire.
That's alright. She's takin' me home tonight.

She's kind of cold, but yet she's hot on the outside.
Last night got nasty and I'm still kind of tongue tied.
I hate to say it, but she brings out my sick side.
That's alright. She's takin' me home tonight.

She's got whole lot of love (Any way you want it)
But it's never enough
(Finish what you started)
Take me to heaven above
(And leave me brokenhearted)
But I won't be a fool and fight it.
She's gonna use me but I like it. Yeah, yeah.

I bet she's wonderin' if I'm worth her while.
She's judge and jury and she's got me on trial.
But I ain't sweatin' cause I'm first on the speed dial.
Yeah, that's right, she's takin' me home tonight.

She always leaves and makes me feel kind of sleazy.
It's kind of cool because she already pleased me.
I'm lying here just thinking this is too easy.
Yeah, that's right, she's takin' me home tonight.

She's got a whole lot of love
(Anyway you want it)
But it's never enough
(Finish what you started)
Take me to heaven above
(And leave me brokenhearted)
But I won't be a fool and fight it.

She's got a whole lot of love
(Anyway you need it)
But I've run out of luck
(Now she says she leavin)
Leavening me in the dust (But that's ok, we're leavin')
But I won't be a fool and fight it.

She's gonna use me but I like it. (Like it)
She's gonna use me but I like it. Yeah, yeah.

I think I might go with the safe bet this time.

She's got a whole lot of love.
(Anyway you want it)
But it's never enough
(Finish what you started)
Take me to heaven above
(And leave me brokenhearted)
But I won't be a fool and fight it.

She's got a whole lot of love
(Anyway you need it)
But I've run out of luck
(Now she says she leavin)
Leaving me in the dust
(But that's ok we're leavin)
But I won't be a fool and fight it.

And darling I just can't deny it.
Because you use me and I like it. (Like it)
Because you use me and I like it. (Like it)

Yeah Yeah

Like it. (Like it.)

Because you use me and I like it. (Like it)

Yeah, yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
