That was solid chemistry that was there with you and me
That was still a long time come

Its freaking me out, that I didnt see
Youre so damn hot girl, its just crazy
And without a doubt I still cant believe
That you were right there in front of me

Never saw the chemistry
That was there with you and me
Its been a long time coming

Just waiting for an angel
To take me out of my hell
Im falling for you
Just dropping out of thin air
You came out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
When heaven sent you

And night after night, I didnt sleep
But that was before you laid beside me
When all of my demons were dancing with me
Im glad you came down because I was in too deep---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
