Just a kid, just a fool
Always trying to play it so cool
So he did what he knew
He left home and he dropped out of school

He wanted fame, fame, fame
Even just a little bit of shame, shame, shame
He would sell his soul over in
Changed his name, never going to get it back, no

Hes got money, but hes way off track
So lonely that it makes him think back
To his family and his friends and the lady he left back home
Hes loaded and alone
Hes loaded and alone

Still a kid, still a fool
Still trying to break all the rules
A big house, with too many rooms
An ego, to go with it too

He got his fame, fame, fame
More than just a little bit of shame, shame, shame
That he sold his soul over in
Changed his name, never going to get it back, no

Hes got money, but hes way off track
So lonely that it makes him think back
To his family and his friends and the lady he left back home
Hes loaded and alone
Hes loaded and alone

He got his fame, fame, fame
Such a shame, shame, shame

Hes got money, but hes way off track
So lonely that it makes him think back
To his family and his friends and the lady he left back home

Hes got money, but hes way off track
So lonely that it makes him think back
To his family and his friends and the lady he left back home

Hes loaded and alone
Hes loaded and alone

He wanted fame, fame, fame
And such a shame, shame, shame
He got his fame, fame, fame
Such a shame, shame, shame

Yeah,
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lone
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lone
Yeah, yeah, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
