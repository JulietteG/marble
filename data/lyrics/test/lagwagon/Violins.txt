I am just another fool, and I have to, keep telling myself that
I am just a hypocrite, and I have to, keep calling you one
Cause I forgot to bite my tongue, and my assumption, is the mother of all mistakes
But I assume the role, open my mouth, and clumsy words escape

So why you, wanna be there, when you could be here, you are slipping away

I awake to your replacement, a bottle in my mouth, in an unfamiliar place
Because you put me out, the butt of a sick joke, into this ashtray life
As you come and go, cause I forgot to service you, and we broke down
And you can't live with my mistakes, but I assume false grace
Open my arms and grasp for something true

How are you, how have you been, girl I miss you, wanna see you again
Oh why you, wanna be there, when you could be here, you are slipping away

I bring out the worst in you, and you try to let me know
You bring out the worst in me, anxiety, anxiety
I'm trying to let you go, you say I'm giving you the creeps
But I assume the role, open my claws and grasp for your heart

How are you, how have you been, girl I miss you, wanna see you again
Into you like a mortal stake so vindictive
Your love's slipping away

Violins, into this ashtray life
Violins, the butt of your sick joke
Violins, I'm trying hard to let you go
Violins---Lyrics submitted by Francine.
