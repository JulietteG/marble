Tell me if I'm good enough
Then tell me if you're strong enough
Tell me if I'm too late
To make up for my mistakes

I have said this before
But it means so much more to me this
Time has been on my side till now 
I can't believe I let it get this bad

Dont you want something better

And now I'm going crazy
Losing you has faded me
You've taken on another hand
This changing everything I've planned

You told me in confidence
That you had to admit it didn't feel right
When I can understand those things
I never quite got before

Don't you want something better
Something bigger then we are
This is my open letter
There's a sign that it's not far.. yeah

Despite all the reasons people tend to go astray
There's nothing left behind that
All this pain will go away
I can't say goodbye
So I won't even try

Don't you want something better
Something bigger than we are
This is my open letter
There's a sign that its not far

Tell me if i'm good enough

Tell me if your strong enough---Lyrics submitted by Victor.
