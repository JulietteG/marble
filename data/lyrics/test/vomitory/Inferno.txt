Severe winds comes in from the east, the air burns in the throat
Humans fall in clouds of steam as the warm skin catches fire

Inferno
The skin breaks up in open wounds, the hair burns on their
scalps a suffocating steaming skin eats into the flesh

Inferno
Dying children lies vomiting blood
Pathetic, wounded, in pain
The withers in the scorching flames
Bleeding, crying in vain

Bleeding
Inferno - Human flames
Inferno - Acid winds
Inferno - Steaming skin
Inferno - The soil shall be drenched in blood

Frustration into relief as the nerves are burnt apart
The pain shall cease as the bloodstains grow
Upon the lifeless ground

Inferno - Human flames
Inferno - Acid winds
Inferno - Steaming skin
Inferno - The soil shall be drenched in blood---
