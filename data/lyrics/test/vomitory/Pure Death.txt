Bombexplosions, cascades of flames
Pressure waves, reopened graves
Genocide, napalm shall fall
Massdeath, burning us all

Naked bodies, burn in piles
Massive ashes, cremation fires
Pure death

Nervegas, death comes as steam
Inhale, its too late to scream
Zyklon B, pulsating pain
aching skin, bloodbursting veins

Naked bodies, burn in piles
Massive ashes, cremation fires
Pure death

Human fragment, cadaverous blood
Plague spreads with the wind
Swarms of vermin, insect clouds
Invades the rotten air

Pestilence, covered with dripping sores
Bloody breath, taste the chemical whore
Feverous, all senses are weakening
Starvation, maneating instinct

Naked bodies, burn in piles
Massive ashes, cremation fires
Pure death---
