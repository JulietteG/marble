The sun was swallowed by the shrouds on a vast horizon red as blood
The air stood still, all winds were gone,
Breath got weaker than ever before
They were coming in thousands, pale faces appeared
Awaiting a storm from above
When the shadows swept down through devouring clouds
The reaction froze in their mesmerized eyes

Landmines crushed the ones who fled
Into cascades of blood and burning soil
A storm of flames sweeps through the air
Ruins on fire fell over weak ones who was left behind

The pressure waves comes blasting those
Who still stands to the ground
Claws of heat tears the pale skin from the ashes of their flesh
Firewinds at lightning speed shatters a thousand deafening screams
Echoes of their bleeding throaths drowns into the massive light

Landmines crushed the ones who fled
Into cascades of blood and burning soil
A storm of flames sweeps through the air
Ruins on fire fell over weak ones who was left behind

Through the scattered masses swept the blinding light
Their shadows was forever burnt into the bleached ground
as they fled in vain.

Bloodstained and burnt comes the ones who was spared
crawling out of the mist
The light of the sun can not touch their eyes from above
perpetual clouds of dust
Only the light from the still burning fires shall be the last
they will ever see
As nervegasclouds are drifting around and fills the air
they must breathe

Too weak to die by their own hands they crawl among the ashes
as nervegasclouds embraces them they suffocate
with bleeding throats
Convulsions tears the feverous skin, epileptic chainreaction
Thousand of rats spreads through the dark where
Nervegasclouds shall drift forever more---
