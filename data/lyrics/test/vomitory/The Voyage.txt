Indispensable hatred combined with tattered souls; a sinister
Derision against all those who are expecting the new millennium.
World war three and the waves of infection have defeated the name of life.
Annihilation of the human self-destruction is the vision;

My dead mind still can see
My dead mind still can grasp;

Now when my soul levitates towards one of the opened circles
Into the never touched material, to begin defenseless in a new dimension.
On my way I catch a glimpse of an obvious light, a summoning,
That will bring away the malefactors that once belonged to the moon.

Desperate screeches implore for mercy.
Their footsteps forces through the infernal fog.
With closed eyes in hope to regain the past
They dimly see the fateful fire whose glow pulsates a shine
That stretches after their expectant and fearful gazes.

The skepticism that in immemorial times has been exercised by
Creatures now vanquish in endless punishment.

Now when my soul levitates towards one of the opened circles
Into the never touched material, to begin defenseless in a new dimension.
On my way i catch a glimpse of an obvious light, a summoning,
That will bring away the malefactors that once belonged to the light.

There senses no longer can accept the act.

Defenseless you see your own organs collapse.
"drain out the liquid of life"
Blood!
"drain out the liquid of life"

Distracted: now i breathe the most sinister breathe of them all.
Coincident: the creation of the reincarnation so interesting and exiting.
The hidden experience revealing parts that caress me through my coexistence.
From epochs to millenniums far away from the core of atmosphere. ---
