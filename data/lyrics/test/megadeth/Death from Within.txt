The heat is raging from the rising fires of war
Embers of avarice soon begin to soar
Vengeance breeding greater vengeance, two eyes for one eye
Crowning burning hatred thats lying deep inside

A token gift, destroyers deep within its hold
Revenge of patient men is sweet and best served cold
The enemy inside the belly of the beast
A mighty Trojan horse, tonight the sentries sleep

On the march... No place to run
Time has come... No where to hide
The moon is red... No one is safe
From spilling blood... no living thing survives

Here they fight... regretting nothing
Here you die... the walls are caving in
Nothing left... a lethal encounter
Its judgment time... when death comes from within

Warning signs ignored, they have all but been denied
Prophets and messengers, mocked and vilified
Final destination lying deep inside their court
Their first line of defense soon became their last resort

Hardened deceivers entered through their open gates
Silent trained assassins, lying still, in wait

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
Their petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
Their just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

Death from within...---
