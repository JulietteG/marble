Just got in from the cold, man
After bein on the road
Found some parking near the Bowery
Man its great to be back home

Gave a homeless guy some spare change
He was sitting by the door
Smiled and he said God bless you sonny.....
So I gave him 23 cents more

	And Hillys got 10 great bands booked
	The barmaids got some cool tattoos
	Everyones got green and red hair
	And I can get some Holiday booze

All the Christmas lights are turned on
Plus the menorah on the wall
Louise holds it all together
She always loves it when I call

Saw Joey standing on the corner
of Bleecker with Dee Dee and Mark
Wonder if theyll check the show out
I cant wait until it starts

	And Hillys got 10 great bands booked
	The barmaids got some cool tattoos
	Everyones got green and red hair
	And I can get some Holiday booze

		Christmas at C.B.G.B.s
		Here with all the friends I know
		Christmas at C.B.G.B.s
		Man, its good to be back home

Both the bathrooms look the same here
Just pick a door and hurry up
Got some students here from Norway
And they cant seem to get enough

I see the bands behind the main stage
In graffiti-covered rooms
Exchanging gifts and knockin beers back
Making sure their guitars tuned

	And Hillys got 10 great bands booked
	The barmaids got some cool tattoos
	Everyones got green and red hair
	And I can get some Holiday booze

		Christmas at C.B.G.B.s
		Here with all the friends I know
		Christmas at C.B.G.B.s
		Man, its good to be back home

Watched the last band wrap its set up
So I bid the crew good night
Left some non-parils at the door for Louise
And staggered out under the street light

Saw a star above ol SoHo
As the cabs went rushing by
And the City seemed at peace now
Set against a blackened sky

	And Hillys got 10 great bands booked
	The barmaids got some cool tattoos
	Everyones got green and red hair
	And I can get some Holiday booze

		Christmas at C.B.G.B.s
		Here with all the friends I know
		Christmas at C.B.G.B.s
		Man, its good to be back home

Christmas at C.B.G.B.s - Christmas at C.B.G.B.s - Christmas at C.B.G.B.s
		(Man its good to be back home.......)---Lyrics submitted by Kenn.
