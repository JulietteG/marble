It feels like the end of time
Like something bad is coming
Youve been living in the world of lies
Your see through walls are falling
Its getting hard to except that Im losing you

I watch as you sleep
Your nightmares break the silence
I can tell that youre in too deep
Got your mind down to a science
And every time that I touch you 
Im losing you

Youre the eve of my destruction
In the garden of fears

Why am I devastated
You through it all away 
Now whos the one whos lost and lonely
I gotta break away from you
Who will pay for all the things youve done
Im not the only one

Youre out of control inside
I dont need x-ray vision
To see all the desperate signs
You made your heart a prison
I took it all out of fear of losing you

In the valley of deception
There is a river of tears 

Chorus 

So many nights
So many fights
So many days
Too easy to erase

Chorus---Lyrics submitted by Buddha.
