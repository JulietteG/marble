Too much, too fast maybe
I don't know where my destiny's taking me
So I'll go wherever it leads me
Too high, too low baby
I wanna know where my destiny's taking me
So I'll go to make you believe me, yeah
Cry, cry when there's something to cry about
(cry, cry when there's something to cry about)
Cry, cry baby but don't drown in the sadness

It's madness
Don't ask me to explain
Don't take away the pain
It's impossible to save me
So come on

Too cheap and too scary
Too creepy, too marry
Too serious, too mysterious
And way too, way too deep
Cry, cry when there's something to cry about
(cry, cry when there's something to cry about)
Cry, cry baby but don't drown in the sadness

It's madness
Don't ask me to explain
Don't take away the pain
It's impossible to save me
It's madness
So easy to complain
Nobody left to blame
It's impossible to save me

Crack in the shield, feels so unreal
No one to blame for losing the flame
Crack in the shield
Lost in the fields of sadness
It's madness (madness), oh yeah

It's madness (madness)
Don't ask me to explain
Don't take away the pain
It's impossible to save me
Save me from madness
Oh It's madness
Know that it's madness
Wake up it's madness---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
