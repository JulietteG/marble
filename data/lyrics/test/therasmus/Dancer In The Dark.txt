Fate lies ahead
Like the sun will rise
The light has been gone
Far too long from your eyes
But you never changed
Never played your part
And you have erased
All the fear from your heart

And try to forget 
The light in your eyes keeps fading out 
The Night's fading deeper in the heart
Hiding the truth and crashing down 
My baby' s dancer in the Dark

You've seen it all
You don't mind going blind
You've seen it all
All the wonders of life
Run to your boy
Don't conceal your scars
Run to your boy
Let him feel your love
Before it's so late 

And try to forget 
The light in your eyes keeps fading out 
The Night's fading deeper in the heart
Hiding the truth and crashing down 
My baby' s dancer in the Dark

Your sight is dying but you keep on trying
To save your boy
You keep on lying but your false illusions 
Will be destroyed
You heard it singing but you dance away 
Like a falling star

Dancer in the Dark (x4)---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
