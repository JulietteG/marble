I can't believe that it's over
I lost this one
Tonight I'll run free
I wish I had someone to guide me
And pull me up
'cause the lights can't find... me

Stranger... Take me home

I wish I had already found You
I've wasted time
My mind had grown black
I wish I had already known You
You'll save my life
You brought my faith back

Stranger... Take me home
Stranger

And I will love you
Only for tonght
I don't know You
But it's alright
Let me show you heaven

Stranger, take me home

Somehow I feel like I've known you all my life
And we have been together since the dawn of time and
I've been missing vital pieces of the puzzle
You might be the answer stranger

And I will love you
Only for tonght
I don't know You
But it's all right
Let me show you heaven

Stranger, take me home
Stranger... take me home---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
