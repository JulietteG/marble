Once upon a time we had a lot to fight for
We had a dream, we had a plan
Sparks in the air, we spread a lot of envy
Didn't have to care once upon a time

Remember when I swore
My love is never ending
And you and I will never die
Remember when I swore
We had it all
We had it all

I'll sail away, it's time to leave
Rainy days, are yours to keep
Fade away, the night is calling my name
You will stay, I'll sail away

Once upon a time we used to burn candles
We had a place to call a home
The dream that we lived
Was better than divine
Every day was like a gift
Once upon a time

Remember when you swore
Your love is never ending
And you and I would never die
Remember when you swore
We had it all
We'd never fall

Sail away, it's time to leave
Rainy days are yours to keep
Fade away, the twilight is calling my name
You will stay, I'll sail away

No reason to lie
No need to pretend
I'm grateful to die
To live once again
I'm fearless to fly
And reach for the end
And reach for the end
ohhohhhohhhohhh...

Sail away

Sail away, it's time to leave
Rainy days are yours to keep
Fade away, the night is calling my name
You will stay, I'll sail away

Sail away
The night is calling my name
Sail away---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
