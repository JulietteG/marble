I tell the truth even when I lie
Take a deep look in my eyes
All you know and see is fine
Let's wake up the world, let's ride, dale

Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive

Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive

I'm so 3000 and great, they're so 2000 and hate
They want me to fall and fail
Hurry up and wait, i'm a pyscho on a beat
Norman bates, i'm on that bally, as well, as the fire great legs, break
Five, six, seven, eight, i'm some like a pimp, when I put my words on a track, slap
Hussle, hussle, hard, grind, i'm known for that, slap
Hussle, business, manager, and now he's a business man
That chico got more flips than gymnist man
Who is the man? chip chip bang

Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive

Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive

Let's get it like it, automatic
Space invader, dancfloor operator
Supersonic, elevator, next level, upgrader
Take you higher, margin later, right now not later

I feel alive baby, I feel alive in this club
I feel alive baby, I feel alive in this club
I feel alive baby, I feel alive in this club
I feel alive, feel alive

Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive

Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive

I be going faster, and faster
Better make it last, make it last yeah
I be going faster, and faster
Better make it last, make it last now baby

Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive

Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive

I feel alive baby
I feel alive baby
I feel alive baby now I feel great
