Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got

I ain't got time for you baby
Either you're mine or you're not
Make up your mind, sweet baby
Right here, right now's all we got

A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now is all we got

Skip, parap-pap

Islands, diamonds, trips around the world
Don't mean a thing if I ain't your girl

A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now is all we got

A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now is all we got

All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we c'mon
All we got-got, got, got-got, got, got-got

God damn
Skip, parap-pap

Hahaha

Glad that you made it, look around
You don't see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands
And the room's a buzz
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love
Fake chit chat, the things they got
Got a stout reputation of keeping it hot girl
I'm the party of the year and my master plan
Is to make you realize, I'm your man

See the people get live
Underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi
Hold on while I take this flick
Speak easy
Rocking the feathers I'm breezy
Hope you can keep up boys
Cause believe me, I'm the bees nees

It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh

It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, aoh

Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got

What do you think, Goonrock?
Are you ready?

A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now is all we got

A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody---
