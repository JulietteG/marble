oh, snap, oh, snap, oh, snap
Are you ready for this?
oh, snap, oh, snap
Oh
It's me
Fergie (Ha,Ha)
Polow
Fergie, ferg
What's up, baby?
When I come to the club, step aside (oh,snap)
Pop the seats, don't be having me in the line (oh, snap)
VIP cause you know I gotta shine (oh, snap)
Fergie, ferg, and me love you long time (oh,snap)

All my girls get down on the floor
Back to back drop it down real low
I such a lady but I'm dancing like a ho
Cause you know If i cared here we go

(chorus)\
How come everytime you come around my
London,london bridge
Wanna  go down like London, London, London
London,London,London we goin down like..

As the drinks start pouring
And my speech starts slurring
Everybody start lookin so good

That grey goose got your girl feeling real loose
Now I'm wishing I didn't wear these shoes
It's like every time I'm on that dude
Paparazzi put my buisness in the news.

I'm like get up out my face
Before I spray your butt with mace
My lips make you want to have a taste
Ypu got that? I got the bass
(Chorus 2x)

AAh,da ,da, da ,da ,da ,doo, doo ,doo
Me like a bnullot type, you know they coming right,
Fergie love em
My girls support her right (2x)

When I come to the club step aside
Pop the seats don't be having me in line
VIP cause you know i gotta shine
I'm fergie ferg, and me love you long time

All my girls get down on the floor
Back to back drop it down real low
I'm such a lady but im dancing like a ho
Cause if i cared so here we go 

(Chorus 2x)---Lyrics submitted by Sharrique.
