You got a way of saying nothin
That sounds just like hello
You got a way of saying goodnight
That sounds like please don't go
You got a way that soothes me
You got a way and girl it moves me

You got a way
You got a way
You got a way
You got a way
You got a way
You got a way with my heart

i know there's lots of other guys that'd listen
if you told them just to go away
i'm gonna be the one to break tradition
Because I'm in your life to stay
It's not the words you say, it's what you do
Just remember who you're talking to cause

You got a way
You got a way
You got a way
You got a way
You got a way
You got a way with my
Hearts can bend and some can take it
You got my heart please don't break it

So don't you say the words just sit and listen
To what i'm going to say to you
it won't take but a few short words and
Every one is true
Small talk, big action
Guarantee you satisfaction

You got a way
You got a way
You got a way
You got a way
You got a way with my heart
You got a way with my heart

You got a way
You got a way with my heart
You got a way
You got a way with my heart
You got a way---Lyrics submitted by Steven Fisher.
