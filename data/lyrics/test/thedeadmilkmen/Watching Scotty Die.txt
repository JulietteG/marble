i've got a kid his name is scott, he's going blind and his blood just will not clot.
the doctors line in rows, to stick tubes up scottie's nose.
there in the field where scottie used to play till something called number 42
was dumped in it one day.

i think it's so funny, i laugh until i cry just me and god, watching scottie die.
just me and god, watching scottie die.

chemical plant across the street, wreathes of steam that color our white sheets.
it's been happening for years, now I'm crying rainbow tears.
one day our dog went out to play, instead of gray, he came back colored yellow.
the chemical man said 'stay mellow, it happens all the time' 
now scottie's skin is lime..............

i think it's so funny, i laugh until i cry, just me and god, watching scottie die.
just me and god, watching scottie die.---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
