She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child but she's always a woman to me

She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
Yes she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me

Oh! she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh..she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind

And she'll promise you more than the garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
But you bring out the best and the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself 'cause she's always a woman to me

 Humming(Chorus)

Oh! she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh...and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind

She's frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel
And she can do as she pleases she's nobody's fool
And she can't be convicted she's earned her degree
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you but she's always a woman to me


Humming (Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by mark.
