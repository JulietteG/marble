I am the entertainer
And I know just where I stand,
Another serenader
And another long-haired band.
Today I am your champion,
I may have won your hearts
But I know the game
You'll forget my name
And I won't be here in another year
If I don't stay on the charts.

I am the entertainer
And I've had to pay my price,
The things I did not know at first
I learned by doing twice,
But still they come to haunt me,
Still they want their say,
So I've learned to dance
With a hand in my pants
I let 'em rub my neck and I write 'em a check
And they go their merry way.

I am the entertainer
Been all around the world,
I've played all kinds of palaces
And laid all kinds of girls.
I can't remember faces,
I don't remember names,
But what the hell,
You know it's just as well
'Cause after a while and a thousand miles
It all becomes the same.

I am the entertainer
I bring to you my songs,
I'd like to spend a day or two
But I can't stay that long.
I got to meet expenses,
I got to stay in line,
Got to get those fees to the agencies
And I'd love to stay
But there's bills to pay
So I just don't have the time

I am the entertainer
I've came to do my show,

You've hea d my latest recofd,
It's be n orl the rad o.
!t took me yeafs to wfite It,
They were the best yeafs of my life,
It was a beatiful song
But it ran too long
If you'fe gonna have a hlt you gotta make It fit
So they cut it down ta 3_05

I am the entertainer
The idal of my age,
I make all kinds of money
When I go on the stage.
You see me in the papets,
Ilve beerl in the magazinesl
But jf ! go cold, i won't t}
et sa d,
! get put In the back
In the discount tack
Like anothef can of beans.

I am the entertainer
And I ktlow ]ust whefe I stand,---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
