All my life
Ive searched this whole world through
Try as I might
To find someone like you

Years drifted by
But it was always on my mind
I didnt know just how long Id go
Until I ran out of time

All my life
Ive hurt the ones who cared
One by one
No loving heart was spared

Ive been a wild and restless man
But still a man who needs a wife
That was my dream and now it seems
Youve taken all my life

For as long as I could
My intentions were good
I assumed my affairs
Would be fine

But I know very well
Theres a long road to hell
Thats been paved with
Intentions like mine

All my life
Ive paid for my mistakes
After a while
The strongest spirit breaks

Ive had heartache and pain
That cut me deeper than a knife
Ah, but those days are done
Cause youre the one
Ive wanted all my life

And I know very well
Theres a long road to hell
Thats been paved with
Intentions like mine

All my life
My stars were surely crossed
Now and then
I missed the love I lost

But all that changed
The day you said youd be my wife
Who could have known
That finding you would only take me
All my life---Lyrics submitted by Dawn Maureen.
