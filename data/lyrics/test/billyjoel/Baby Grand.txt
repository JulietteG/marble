Late at night, when it's dark and cold
I reach out for someone to hold.
When I'm blue, when I'm lonely
she comes through
She's the only one who can. 
My baby grand is all I need.

In my time, I've wandered everywhere
around this world.
She would always be there.
Anyday. Any hour.
All it takes is the power
in my hands.
This baby grand's been good to me.

I've had friends, oh but they slipped away.
And I've had fame, but it doesn't stay
I've made fortunes, spent them fast enough.
As for women, they don't last
with just one man.
But my baby grand is gonna stand by me.

They say no one's gonna play this
on the radio.
They said melancholy blues were dead
and gone.
But only songs like these, played in minor keys
keep those memories holding on.

I've come far, from the life I strayed in
and I've got the scars from those dives I played in.
Now I'm home, and I'm weary
And in my bones every dreary one night stand
My baby grand is coming home with me, with me
Ever since this gig began
My baby grand's been good to me---Lyrics submitted by mark.
