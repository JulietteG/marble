You are the one
who makes it worth waking up in the morning
i'd trade the sun for the chance to show you i'm all in
we could be like jay and beyonce
bonnie and clyde just like the movie
take that chance on love (yeah yeah)
now i can't predict what the future holds
but i'll fight forever to keep you close (yeah)

i'd give it all up baby
trade in the world to show i'm falling,
i'm falling (yeah)
don't need the fame or money
as long as i got you babe
i'm falling, i'm falling
tell all them other girls i've fallen..

put me to the test
i'll prove to you i'll never be a heartache
cos you're the best
you deserve the best
rule this world like michelle and barack
be my girl we'll live up on top
take that chance on love (yeah yeah)
now i can't predict what the future holds
but i'll fight forever to keep you close (yeah)

i'd give it all up baby
trade in the world to show i'm falling,
i'm falling (yeah)
don't need the fame or money
as long as i got you babe
i'm falling, i'm falling
tell all them other girls i've fallen..

oh i want the world to see (see)
so i bring you like some jewelry
to show you that i'm not ashamed
i'm falling, i'm falling (yeah)
i'm telling all them other girls
and everybody round the world
i told you girl i'm not ashamed
i'm falling, i'm falling (yeah yeah)

i'd give it all up baby
trade in the world to show i'm falling,
i'm falling (yeah)

i'd give it all up baby
trade in the world to show i'm falling,
i'm falling (yeah)
don't need the fame or money
as long as i got you babe
i'm falling (i'm falling baby), i'm falling
tell all them other girls (tell all them other girls)
(tell all them other girls)
i've fallen..---Lyrics submitted by David.
