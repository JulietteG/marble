Never thought that I'd say wish I didn't love you ever
Since the first date when you got close my heart
Would just stop thought me and you together would end
Up on top, you changed me for better for worse I know
I was caught up alway's put you first I never once thought
You would be triflin but o I was blinded...

[Chorus:]
I was like oh oh oh never wanna let you go go go
Cause I was open before I was open before but
Now I know... That love made me blind so I could'nt
See all the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind, love made blind, love made me blind,
Your love made me blind.

I gave all of my trust didn't think being faithfull was asking
To much but I'm good glad that I know now I was fooled but
Fate let me see how they say every tear has it's reasons
Every smile has it's own season never once thought
Youd be this triflin but o I was blinded...

[Chorus:]
I was like oh oh oh never wanna let you go go go
Cause I was open before I was open before but
Now I know... That love made me blind so I could'nt
See all the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be.
Your love made me blind, love made blind, love made me blind,
Your love made me blind.

Cause I felt your lips pressed against mine thought the
Sweet smell of your perfume was all mine, I love the
Way you scream my name...

That love made me blind so I could'nt
See all the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be.
Your love made me blind, your love made blind, your love made me blind,
Your love made me blind.---Lyrics submitted by king.
