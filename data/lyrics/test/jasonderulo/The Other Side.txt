In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin
Smiling in the photo booth
But we got closer (Yeah)
Till you were eating off my spoon
And coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight well just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, Were going all the way

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we aint friends anymore
If we walk down this road
Well be lovers for sho
So tonight kiss me like its do or die
And take me to the other side

This could be perfect
But we wont know unless we try (Try)
I know youre nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight well just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, Were going all the way

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we aint friends anymore
If we walk down this road
Well be lovers for sho
So tonight kiss me like its do or die
And take me to the other side

(Woah)
Kiss me like its do or die
And take me to the other side
Tonight well just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, Were going all the way

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we aint friends anymore
If we walk down this road
Well be lovers for sho
So tonight kiss me like its do or die
And take me to the other side

(Woah)
Take me to the other side
(Woah)
And take me to the other side
(Woah)
Kiss me like its do or die
(Woah)
And take me to the other side---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
