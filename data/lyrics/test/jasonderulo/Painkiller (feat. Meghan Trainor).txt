M Train, Jason Derulo, true

I thought my heart might break cause slowly this kills
Not everyone needs space (oh no)
You were the doctor gave, I swallowed the pill
I never loved this way (oh no)

You pick me up and give me higher
You fill my cup with desire

Baby I'm back now feeling how I used to feel
You got me back now, stick around, this is for reals
You put it do-do-do-down, my painkiller
You put it do-do-do-down, my painkiller
Baby I'm back now feeling how I used to feel
You got me back now, stick around, this is for reals
You put it down
You put it down

I had to turn the page to get here to you
Love how you numb my pain (oh yeah)
But all the nurses saved me, where is the juice?
What makes you go insane (oh yeah)

Check this out, I'm 'bout to kiss it, make it better, kiss and make it better babe
Kiss and make it better, kiss and make it better babe
I'mma kiss it, make it better, kiss and make it better babe
Kiss and make it better, kiss and make it better babe
You the best---
