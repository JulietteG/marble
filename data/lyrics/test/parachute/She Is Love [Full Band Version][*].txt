I've been beaten down
I've been kicked around
But she takes it all for me
And i lost my faith, in my darkest days
But she makes me want to believe

They call her love, love, love, love, love(x2)
She is all i need

Well i had my ways, they were all in vain
But she waited patiently
It was all the same
All my pride and shame
And she put me on my feet

They call her love, love, love, love, love(x3)
She is love, and she is all i need

And when that world slows down, dear
And when those stars burn out, here
Oh she'll be there, yes she'll be there

They call her love, love, love, love, love(x4)
She is love, and she is all i need(x3)
She's all i need---Lyrics submitted by tiffani.
