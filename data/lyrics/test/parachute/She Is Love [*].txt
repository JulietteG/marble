I've been beaten down,
I've been kicked around
but she takes it all from me
and I lost my faith
in my dark place
she makes me want to believe

chorus
they call her love,love,love,love,love (x2)
she is love
and she is all I need(x2)

well I had my ways
they were all in vaine
she waited patiently 
it was all the same
all my pride and shame
she put me on my feet

chorus
they call her love,love,love,love,love(x2)
she is love
and she is all I need
she is love 
and she is all I need
she is love
and she Is all I need---Lyrics submitted by Erin.
