Every avenue in Tokyo
Is saying that I'm gonna make it
It's offering the two of us a chance
And knows, oh, we're gonna take it

All we need to do is lead us to the floor
It'll detonate us
We'll show 'em what the beat is for into the chord
Girl they'll celebrate us

Made in Japan! Oh! We're made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh! We're made in Japan!

Fortune and fame
Suddenly, I can be a real supernova (supernova, supernova)
Shooting straight my name in neon lights
In the sky before it's over

Imagine us having fans
Think of when a-all of them are screamin'
Our fantasy is so getting out of hand
I'm loving what I'm dreamin'!

Made in Japan! Oh! We're made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh! We're made in Japan!

Woke up in another world
Now we're on as sama girls
Getting our kimono on
Singing karaoke songs

Eating sushi, drinking tea
In the shade of maple trees
Lotus flowers everywhere
Breathing in exotic air

The manga artists take a bow
Animes with total wow
My imagination sparks
When I'm in Yoyogi Park

Could it be this distant land
Scrambled crossing upper plans?
Loving cosplay, gotta say
Sayonara U.S.A.

Made in Japan! Oh! We're made in Japan!
Made in Japan! Oh! We're made in Japan!

Oh, oh, oh!
Made in Japan, made in Japan!
Made in Japan, made in Japan!
Made in Japan, made in Japan!
Made in Japan, made in Japan!
