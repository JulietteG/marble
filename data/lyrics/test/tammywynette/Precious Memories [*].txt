Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, scared scenes unfold
As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, old grows fonder 
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
