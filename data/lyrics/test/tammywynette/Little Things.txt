I hope I won't disturb you with this call
I'm just in town for such a little while
And I thought perhaps you'd like to hear the news
Jeannie's grades were the highest in the school

Billy sure does look a lot like you
I understand your other son does too
And Billy said tell Dad I miss him so
These were some little things I thought you'd like to know

Remember Sam and Peg who lived next door
With them it seemed we always laughed so much
Well Sam and Peg don't live there anymore
I understand they broke up just like us

The house we lived in now has been torn down
Of all the things we owned the last to go
A freeway now runs through that part of town
These were some little things that I thought you'd like to know
These were some little things I just thought you'd like to know ---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
