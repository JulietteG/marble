I believe in fairy tales
Where knights in shining armor come along
You were my knight in shining armor
And you stole my heart with a song

You gave me a castle and a princess
And I was the world's proudest queen
But then came the dragon in the bottle
And I watched as it slowly slayed the king

And we all lived happy never after
For we just put the castle up for sale
But I guess that I will always be a dreamer
Cause I still believe in fairy tales

Yes I still believe in fairy tales---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
