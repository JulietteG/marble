I see you on the avenue
where you know them and they know you
down so low there's nowhere left to fall
And I watch you bend like twigs against  the changing of the times
And whither under weight that weighs upon us all
Just hoping that someone will hear your call

Red dirt and sand may cover all the land
And everything may fall apart
But as soon as you know
You'll be steady as you go on
Like a blackbird through the dark

I see your faith begin to sway
As promise seems to slip away
And all the days just break to test your will
As the sun goes down on the west
And we all learn to live with less
Desire burns a hole you'll never fill
And It's hand like a stain is on you still

Red dirt and sand may cover all the land
And everything may fall apart
But as soon as you know
You'll be steady as you go on
Like a blackbird through the dark---Lyrics submitted by Laura Vug.
