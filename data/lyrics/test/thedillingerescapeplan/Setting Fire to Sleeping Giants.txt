First Off 
Let me Say 
You look so tired
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky
I'm thinking 'bout another world...

TTTOOOONNNNNIIIIIIIIIIIIGGHHHHHHTTTT!!! RAHR RAHR RAAAHHH!!
YOU'RE ON!! YOU'RE ON!! YOU'RE ON!!!

So drop the gown 
The game's over
Just push your face into the fight
And it breaks my heart like dancin' up all night
Ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong LIKE NOTHIN'WE'VE EVER FELT BEFOOOOOOOORRRRE AAAHHHH!! RRAAHH!! RAAHHH!!
YOU'RE ON!! YOU'RE ON!! YOU'RE OOONN!!

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be 
In broken alleys in the back of every street 
Close your eyes TONIIIGGGHHHTT!!!
BABY YOU CAN HAVE IT!!!!!!
BABY 
YOU CAN 
HAVE IT!!

(Loungecore...)

Ooh baby gnaw me down to the bone
soon you'll find I'm ever gonna take you back home 
well there's so much you never told me and there's not much I want to know
'cause your pretty face will do just fine 
You'll be the star of my eery last show
Let's go for a long ride 
I'll show you places you won't ever want to be 
in broken alleys in the back of every street 
tonight we could bring it all down 
we could bring it all down 
They think this body's a dead note dancing to the beat 
but they'll never see this corpse coming
till it kills them---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
