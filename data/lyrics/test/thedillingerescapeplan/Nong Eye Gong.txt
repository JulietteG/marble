Now
You laugh forever you laugh
The winner and the best man
Corrupter
Shapeshifter
Your voice is the sound of nothing
Butcher of every artform
Peddler of deceit
Watching the hour hand drag
Destroyer of the past
We're smart enough to say we're sorry
Not smart enough to start again
Dancing in death's illusion
The pride before the fall
Candy for the children
Give it to them all---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
