I made a big mistake
With you tonight
The way our insides burned
Like moths flying to light

As the sun begins to set I cannot find my way back
Walking with my eyes on fire I never found the payback

We'll never feel like anything is wrong
But the tragedy is not just our own sad song

I know the games we play
Give us a way
A way for us to see if we still feel alive

As the sun begins to set I cannot find my way back
Walking with my eyes on fire I never found the payback

We'll never feel like anything is wrong
But the tragedy is not just our own sad song
Walls we have built and bridges we have burned
Deeper the hole the further we feel from harm

I'll hold on to this forever
This is never long enough
Time is always right behind us
Like the lamb under the gun
I'll hold on to this forever
That is never long enough---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
