Is the can half-diseased or is the disease half-canned?
And is the man half-machine or is the machine half-man?
I'm unretrofied for you

I'll just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song and leave dead in the end
Time is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again

Now they're looting our holes until there is nothing left
Calloused intentions it seems -- coward's invention at best
I'm unretrofied for you

I'll just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song and leave dead in the end
Time is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again

Jesus can't play the music 'caused he's nailed to the cross
And over gnawed off feet I find that I can't walk
I can't even walk

I'll just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song and leave dead in the end
Time is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again

We're all dead---Lyrics submitted by Carlos.
