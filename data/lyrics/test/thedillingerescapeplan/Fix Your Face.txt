You want a vision you can't have
A line that you can't walk
Writhing around on the floor
You won't be aware 'til it's too late
Cause you never look around
You're like a deer in the headlights baby
Queen of delusion you will never learn compassion
Start a fire and you can never put it out
You're burning up in the blaze you started
I want to see you face down
Because I know that you play that part so well

At our wake the casket is open ready for viewing
But we are still moving
Already we smell of rot
There will be no comeback
No coming back for any of us now
No way out

Don't you realize there is nowhere you can hide
Where I'm from there is never a rest for the hunted
No way you and I will ever be done
We're never apart
Whatever you're doing
We will always cross your mind
You were young and now you pay the price for her---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
