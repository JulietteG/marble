I'm a happy man
I'm a happy man
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, my baby
You look so good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah my baby 
Just like I knew you would
Tonight when we go out
I'm feelin' so proud
Walking hand in hand
Down the lovers lane

And I I I love you, baby
I love you so
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, my baby
Of this you know
'Cause I'm a happy man
I'm a happy man
I'm a happy man
yeah, baby, I'm a happy man
Whooooa, yeah
I'm a happy man
Come on down and sing the song
Sing it just-a one more time
And when we take a stroll 
Tonight if it's cold
We'll cuddle up close
And baby, baby, baby
I'll kiss you baby

We'll be as one
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I love my baby
We'll have some fun
'Cause I'm a happy man
I'm a happy man
I'm a happy man
Yeah, baby, I'm a happy man
Whooooa, yeah
I'm a happy man
Come on down and sing the song
Sing it just-a one more time
Whooooa, yeah
I'm a happy man---Lyrics submitted by teresa.
