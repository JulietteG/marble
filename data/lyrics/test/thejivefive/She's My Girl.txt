See the pretty girl
Walking down the street
She's the kind of girl
All the fellas want to meet

But she's my girl
She belongs to me 
(She belongs to me)
Oh, yeah

She's so good lookin'
To and by
Everbody knows she's
Mine, oh, mine

Yeah she's my girl
She belongs to me
(She belongs to me)

She's my girl I,
Love her so
Yeah she's my girl
And I'll never let her go

She's my girl
And I want you all to know
That I love, love, love her
So-o-o-o-o

She's my girl
And she'll always be
She promised me her love
'til eternity

Yeah she's my girl
She belongs to me
(She belongs to me)

She's my girl and I,
Love her so
Yeah she's my girl
And I'll never let her go

She's my girl
And I want you all to know
That I love, love, love her
So-o-o-o-o

She's my girl
And she'll always be
She promised me her love
'til eternity

Yeah she's my girl
She belongs to me
(She belongs to me)

Woah, c'mon baby
Baby, baby, baby c'mon
Come on baby, come on baby---Lyrics submitted by Noah Midcap.
