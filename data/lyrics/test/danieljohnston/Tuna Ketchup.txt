I saw her in the street
She was with her family
She didn't say anything
She just stopped and stared
And I like her

In the summer I worked with her
In an oil refinery
She wore a yellow suit in the rain
And I like her

I drew her some pictures
I made her posters
I let her walk all over me
And insult me too
Cause I like her

She has red hair
And blue eyes
I was looking for love
But all I got was a bite
And I like her
And I like her
And I like her---Lyrics submitted by Michael Backaus.
