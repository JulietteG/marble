And what a fuckin waste of a day, we just lay around and waste away!!
Cause when that sun goes down its bottoms up, we try to reach the bottom of that endless cup!!

Everybodys getting older, but no ones growing up!!
As the weathers getting colder, the room starts heating up!!

Cams hair just keeps falling out and Chris just keeps getting fatter!!
But from where I sit now, on this rickety stool, none of that shit really matters!!
Because (this is our versailles), palace on the swamp!!

Listen to me for a nominal fee, you can have anything you want!!
What matters the most is that bad joke ghost, circling your bloated corpse at the end of the haunt!!

Kneel before me peasantry!! Im so drunk I cant feel a thing!! 
Pledge your allegiance to the fucking swamp king, drunk as hell, dumb as all get out!! So pucker up those pretty lips of yours and kiss my ass and shut your mouth!!


Sometimes a knife right through your heart, is exactly what you need..
Sometimes the things that youre ashamed of, make you who youre supposed to be..

Listen to me for a nominal fee, you can have anything you want!! 
(well remain here, well remain here forever and always)...
What matters the most is that bad joke ghost circling your bloated corpse at the end of the haunt!!
(well remain here, well remain here for always)..

Like one million other soldiers on a thousand other battlefields we wait, wait for the dawn ..
Like a million other soldiers, yes we wait...

This is our versailles, palace on the swamp...this is our versailles...---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
