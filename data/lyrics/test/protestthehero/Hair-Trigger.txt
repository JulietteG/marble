That sweet little redhead's got her hooks in my back,
She points her finger and she shows me what I lack.
Her pale skin, it burns so hot in the midnight air,
She paints the streets a shade of gray around my chair, so come on in..

Her heartbreak on my skin and her scent on my fingers,
Her taste is on my mind, it constantly lingers...

'Till I can breathe her, 'till I can believe her
'Till I can breathe her, 'till I can leave her..

Every kiss is a little sickening,
I can feel Death's fingers quickening.
Tightening my passageways,
If you can't count the years, start counting down...

Try to remember that she hates you..
And though she might elate you,
She tries to kill the great that's in you now.
And she's happening to the fate that awaits you now,
And despite her words, it's not too late!!

I wrote a goddamn love song to praise everything I hate.
And kids were wanting the chorus line,
And they sealed my picture's frame!
She might run shit for right now but I'll be damned if it's forever and always..

As the chorus-line fades away like friends in high-school, always...

Oh, I got this feeling,
And things will never, ever, ever be the same!
Things will never be the same!!

What about those rainy nights in London?
What about the crippling desert heat?
What about all those times you swore you'd never leave me?
What about the hospital in L.A.?
It took me begging through the night
What about that blackened image in my mind?
I swear I burn with a new light..
What about that frozen, dripping, holiday burn that's cold..
Cold (cold), cold (cold) cold!!
Cold (cold), cold (cold) cold....
She's cold as ice!!!---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
