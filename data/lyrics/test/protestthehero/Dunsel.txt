And when the underworlds, best kept secret saw its own reflection,
I knew things had finally changed (for better or worse, whatever as always)..
Mid-life fires start to burn and burned down our one protection,
I wont take pictures from their frame (whatever as always)..

When the hands that sold me everything, slapped a price tag on my chest..
Bit my tongue and shut my mouth, tried to blend in with the rest..
But Im a square peg, Im a sore thumb...
And it seems to me this apathy, kills the life in artistry, ankle deep in industry..

All these songs sound so damn good, even if their meanings hollow,
Hollow words dry out your mouth, you might find it hard to swallow..
All the shit that we keep feeding, to keep ourselves and you believing..
That no money could change us, then a door opens up, and some devil persuades us!!

The songs we sung when we were just young, have all but lost their meaning..
But theres still a few things and still a few things, still a few things that we keep on believing... still a few things, and there's still a few things, that we keep on believing..

Shitty music just aint worth makin, smiles and thank yous just aint worth fakin!! 
Some assholes hands just aint worth shakin',  and if it aint broken, we need to break it!!
Theres no such thing as unconditional, though contracts bind you in the end..
Make no mistake this is a killing ground, blood-hungry and camouflaged as friends!!

Select yes at the end of this mess... if you get there and its your only fucking option left..

These days I dont know, the people Im supposed to trust..
and I dont trust these people that Im supposed to know..
The handlebars on my dreams slowly start to rust, theyll take everything and
somehow you still owe!!

As the cocaine cowboys, finally get their wings and sell them all for blow!!

Since I dont know the people I'm supposed to trust, and I don't trust these motherfuckers that I'm supposed to know..
The handlebars on all my dreams, they slowly start to rust..
The cocaine cowboys, finally get their wings you know and sell them all for blow, they finally get their wings you know and sell them all for blow!!

I make music, for myself!!
Not for hat tips from the upper-tier and their undeserved wealth heres to their failing fucking health... 

I dont mean this in a hateful way, but when the people you love start walking away.. 
The walls get tighter each and everyday..
Take your last bite before it crumbles away and theres something inside me I just have to say; love nothing, trust no one, just live for the motherfucking day!!!---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
