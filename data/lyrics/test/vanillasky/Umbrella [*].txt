You had my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share because

[chorus:] 
When the sun shine we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever know that we'll still have eachother
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh eh eh-eh)

[Verse 2:]
These fancy things will never come in between
You're apart of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took his part
When the world has delt it's card
If the hand is hard together we'll mend your heart because

[chorus:] 
When the sun shine we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever know that we'll still have eachother
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh eh eh-eh)

[bridge:]
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more because

[chorus:]
When the sun shine we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever know that we'll still have eachother
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella (ella ella eh eh eh eh eh-eh)

[Outro:]
It's raining (raining)
Oh baby it's raining (raining)
Baby come into me
Come into me
It's raining (raining)
Oh baby it's raining (raining)
You can always come into me

Come into me
It's pouring rain
It's pouring rain
Come into me
Come into me
It's pouring rain---Lyrics submitted by pleyah.
