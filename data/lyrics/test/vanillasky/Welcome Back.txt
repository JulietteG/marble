No matter how I evan try
As long as I know that I'm right
I'm sure they felt the same

What if we stop chasing this dream
Give up to join this endless game
Now and forever

Welcome back California Dreamer
Please shine on me another minute today
Is the day that I could die

Get up it's morning let's go to work
Performing this ancient ritual
This tradition still goes on

Just to weeks to turn your minds off
And to belive you're the only one
Who's gonna live forever

Welcome back California Dreamer
Please shine on me another minute today
Is the day that I could die

Welcome back California Dreamer
Please shine on me another minute today
Is the day that I could die

My friends they've all got a degree
To live the way they used to hate
Gotta be a man just like me
They now say

Welcome back California Dreamer
Please shine on me another minute today
Is the day that I could die

Welcome back California Dreamer
Please shine on me another minute today
Is the day that I could die---Lyrics submitted by Rain.
