(All I want to do is stand close to you)x2

I'll be the one to tell everyone I'm gone
I've fallen in
To a place where I can begin to understand
I'm just happy you're here to hold my hand

(Chorus)
All I wanna do is stand close to you
Be by your side
All I wanna do is make the world revolve 
Around you and I
What I would give up
What I would go through
To get it right
All I wanna do in this lifetime is make you mine
All I wanna do in this lifetime is make you mine


Me secrets out
Its been hidden in my heart
Thats over now
I want everyone to know I found it all
You're te everything I've never had
And baby I got it bad

(Chorus)
All I wanna do is stand close to you
Be by your side
All I wanna do is make the world revolve
Around you and I
What I would give
What I would go through
To get it right
All I wanna do in this lifetime is make you mine
All I wanna do in this lifetime is make you mine

And its far too hard to see(to see)
What the future will be
Everywhere I go(everywhere I go)
Everywhere I go now you're with me

(Chorus)
All I wanna do is stand close to you
Be by your side
All I wanna do is makek the world revolve 
Around you and I
What I would give up
What I would go through
To get it right
All I wanna do in this lifetime is make you mine
All I wanna do in this lifetime is make you mine
