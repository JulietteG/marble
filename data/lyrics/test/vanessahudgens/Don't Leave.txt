I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you 
And all the loneliness i would go through 
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you 

I've been gone so long 
I'm used to feeling alone 
I estimated our love 
My estimation was wrong 
See I never knew what you were going through 
But I just got back 
Now I see where you're at 
How could you have doubted that I would ever be distracted by 
any other guy no matter if he ever caught my eye? 
We just need time 
Some time to connect 
What I'm telling you now 
Hope you never forget it 

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you 
And all the loneliness I would go through 
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you 
Cos I don't want you if you don't want me to be the one 
The only one you wanna run to 
Baby boy you know I've just begun to realize what's important to me 
So don't leave 
Don't leave 

Maybe I should've tried to put your needs first but my priorities were messed up and I know you got hurt 
See I never knew what you were going through 
But i just got back 
Now now I see where you're at 
Think about it 
Take a moment just to rewind 
Everything that you'd be leaving everything that was right 
Do you really wanna stand there and tell me goodbye 
When Im saying I still love you? 

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you 
And all the loneliness I would go through 
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you 
Cos I don't want you if you don't want me to be the one 
The only one you wanna run to 
Baby boy you know I've just begun to realize what's important to me 
So don't leave 
Don't leave 

Lonely days and lonely nights 
That's where you'd be without me by your side 
Better think twice, baby 
This could grow up crazy, you know 
I cant keep singing im speaking cause its out of control 
I gave you everything: Body, mind, heart and soul 
But you keep breaking me, taking me to another low 
Dont do it baby 
Dont do it 
Dont let me go 

I Dont know 
I Dont know 

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you 
And all the loneliness I would go through 
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you 
Cos I don't want you if you don't want me to be the one 
The only one you wanna run to 
Baby boy you know I've just begun to realize what's important to me 
So don't leave 
Don't leave 

Baby boy, Don't leave, Me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
