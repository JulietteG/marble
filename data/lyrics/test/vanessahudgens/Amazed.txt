When I'm all broke down 
Headin' for disaster and 
I'm spinnin' down trying to find a clue 
And my head is tired of aearching for the answer 
Can't figure out how I'm gonna get through the next 10 minutes 

(chours) 
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you 
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do 
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to 
Don't you know (oh) 
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you 
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do 
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to 
Don't you know (oh)\ 

oh-oh(repeats 4x) 

When I'm all burnt down and need a place to run to 
No one hears me shout lost and all alone 
And I'm losing ground no one understands me 
Can't figure out what I'm gonna do cause' I just can't take it 

(chours) 
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you 
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do 
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to 
Don't you know (oh) 
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you 
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do (what your faith can do) 
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to 
Don't you know (oh) 

oh-oh(repeats 4x) 

Lil' Mama Rap: 
If I could think of you and smile 
Ask you could you stay a while 
Even if you gotta go 
Chase your dough 
That's for sure 
It's my love you raising 
With my heart you praising 
Passion, if you stayubg ain't that amazing 
They be calling it a phase 
We gon' keep phasing 
Some don't wanna play the game 
So they keep acing 
That's a loser 
See me, I'mma keep chasing 
Chasing, this do-o-o-ugh 

Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you 
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do 
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to 
Don't you know (oh) 
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you (what I feel for you) 
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do (what your faith can do) 
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to (where you take me to) 
Don't you know (oh)
