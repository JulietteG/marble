Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's so hot, I can't stop
The music fills the room
Vibrations, sensations
That beat goes boom, boom, boom

I've got to keep it together
I've got to keep it together
I've got to keep it together
Watch the crazy people

[Chorus]
Let's dance (let's dance)
Show me (Show me)
Hold me (hold me)
Control me (yeah)
Let's dance (let's dance)
Take me (take me)
Shake me (shake me)
Make me (yeah)

Just like that, don't hold back
Get crazy on the floor
We'll have fun all day long
And then we'll still want more

I've got to keep it together (together)
I've got to keep it together (together)
I've got to keep it together
Watch the crazy people

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
Let's dance, tonight
Show me, feels so right
Hold me, hold me tight
Control me
Let's dance, right now
Take me, spin me 'round
Shake me, shake me down
Make me

Look in my eyes
You'll realize
We can't deny
I'm into you and you're so into me
I know you can't fight what is meant to be

Let's dance
Yeah, (hold me) yeah, yeah, yeah


[Chorus 2] (repeat 2x)

Let's dance...---Lyrics submitted by Emmie.
