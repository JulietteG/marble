Baby, youre my Bugsy Malone and Im your suicide blonde,
You can be my film noir star Im your queen of Saigon
If they dont think were good together, baby, just forget em
And let bygones be bygones.

Baby, I cant do it alone, cause youre the one that I want,
You can be my Tony Montana and I can be your Pfeifer,
Fire, I can take you higher, I can get you hooked on love and desire.

Hello, pretty baby, you can be my cherry pie,
I know what you've done, and I can be your alibi.

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die 
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love suicide?
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die 

And Im running and Im murdering 'em just for fun,
Murdering 'em, murdering 'em, one by one,
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die 

Baby, youre Sylvester Stalone and I can be your Adrienne,
We got the lipstick on you, enduring to say my name again, say my name again, say my name again.

Baby, I cant do it alone, cause youre the one that I want,
You can be my Tony Mantola and I can be Mariah,
Tiger, scream a little higher, I can get you high on love and desire.

I sense Bonnie and Clyde was two kids
So good at being bad, bad, bad.
Im flirting with the check-out counter, baby,
You put the money in the bag.

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die 
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love suicide?
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die 

And Im running and Im murdering 'em just for fun,
Murdering 'em, murdering 'em, one by one,
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die 

Would you kill for me? Would you die for me?
Put your hands where I can see them,
Put them in the air.

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die 
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love suicide?
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die  

And Im running and Im murdering 'em just for fun,
Murdering 'em, murdering 'em, one by one,
It's either live or die boy, It's either live or die---Lyrics submitted by Kyle.
