What?
Who me?
What?

Feet dont fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take
But Im hoping at the gates,
Theyll tell me that youre mine

Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design
I feel so alone on the Friday nights
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you youre mine
It's like I told you honey

Dont make me sad, dont make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I dont know why
Keep making me laugh
Lets go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come on take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Trying to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers honey

Dont make me sad, dont make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I dont know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come on take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words,
This is the last time
Cause you and I
We were born to die [x3]

Come on and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Dont make me sad, dont make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I dont know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come on take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane...
Choose your last words,
This is the last time
Cause you and I
We were born to die ---
