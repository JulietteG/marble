They say Im too young to love you
I dont know what I need
They think I dont understand
The Freedomland of the seventies
I think Im too cool to know ya
You say Im like the ice I freeze
Im churning out novels like
Beat poetry on Amphetamines
I say
I say

My boyfriends in the band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
Ive got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collections rare
I can play most anything
Im a Brooklyn baby
Im a Brooklyn baby

They say Im too young to love you
You say Im too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors like they forgot to read
I think were like fire and water
I think were like the wind and sea
Youre burning up, Im cooling down
Youre up, Im down
Youre blind, I see
But Im free
Im free

My boyfriends in the band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
Ive got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collections rare
I can play most anything
Im a Brooklyn baby
Im a Brooklyn baby

Im talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you dont like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you dont get it, then forget it
So I dont have to fucking explain it

And my boyfriends in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
Ive got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collections rad
I get down to beat poetry
Im a Brooklyn baby
Im a Brooklyn baby

Yeah my boyfriends pretty cool
But hes not as cool as me
Cause Im a Brooklyn baby
Im a Brooklyn baby---
