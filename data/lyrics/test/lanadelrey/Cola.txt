My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who're older
It's always been, so it's no surprise

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side x3

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, baby
Woah, ah yeah

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teachin' me everything he knows

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby, yeah

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side x3


Drugs, suck it up, like Vanilla Ice-ys
Don't treat me rough, treat me really nice-ys
Decorate my neck, diamantes icies
Why, come on, come on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh yeah

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side

Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Come on, come on
Come on, baby
Come on x3 baby
Woah oh why
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
Ooh ah
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
Ooh oh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Cindy Lopez.
