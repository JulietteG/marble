She's the kind of girl who's in my thoughts, all night.
And she's the kind of girl who makes your wrongs, all right.
But she'll never know how I feel deep inside
Everytime that I think of her I cry

She's the kind of girl who brings a love so true
and it's the kind of love that makes me feel so blue
Cause she'll never know how I feel deep inside
Everytime that I think of her I cry

We could last forever
But baby don't you cry
We could last forever
But baby don't you cry
We could last forever
But baby don't you cry---Lyrics submitted by xDrewPz.
