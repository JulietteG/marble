(Young L) 
Got my vans on, but they look like sneakers 
Got my vans on, but they look like sneakers 
Got my vans on, but they look like sneakers 
Red coat white but vans look clean and
Got my vans on, but they look like sneakers 
Got my vans on, but they look like sneakers 
Got my vans on, but they look like sneakers 
Red coat white but vans look clean and

[Verse 1] 
Got my vans on, finna walk out the door 
Put five on the grapes so u know i'm gon' blow 
Got the new pack shoe, bought it right out the door 
Holla at the dope girls, dope boys all GO... 
Man, if u really tight, then u gotta get vans 
See me in the club, bitch i'ma grown man 
If u see me at a party, then it must be crack 
Cost 36 dollars, all black, yes 
Like my niggas may slap and we get clothes mayne 
Fuck coke whites, 'cause my vans fukkin gold 
Got new top-siders finna fly like kites 
Go to sleep in the day, go to parties at night 
Man, i'm from B-town and all my niggas get like... 
Man, we be sportin vans and we throw away Nikes 
If u wanna get right, stop buyin those Nikes 
Get some new fukkin vans and u'll bet u look icey...(hey) 

[Hook] 

[Verse 2] 
I wear checkered vans the same color as snow (hey) 
When Uno spit crack, the same color as coke (yes) 
Got my vans on, but they look like sneakers 
U wearin coke whites, but my vans are cleaner 
They slip in and out real easy, like blunts 
U can get different colors, like rainbows 
Since 1966, Vans had set a trend 
I got a blue pair, yea, in a size 10 
Get ur grown man on, when u wear top-siders 
Button ups and sweaters, equal attire 
1, 2 step 
Yea, get ur boogie on 
Go slide real quick, like you got skates on 
They some punk rock shoes, so they get real dirty 
Sole kinda thick, like a big booty chick 
A big booty chick?... yea, thas what i said 
36 dollars and u cashin out for some vans (hey) 

[Hook] 

[Verse 3] 
(Yea, Young L, lets go) 
Yea, i'm raw nigga, wit my got damn vans on 
Slip 'em off, slip 'em on, cuff in my pants, 
So they don't get torn in the back 
It's a punk rock shoe, with the logo in the back 
Got the red ones laced up in a size 10 
Got the all black vans on witta skull head 
I GO... 
Catch me in my vans goin dumb 
At a function or a party, we gon' get this shyt started 
They got all kinda vans, like checkered different colors 
If u lace 'em pass the fourth hole, u some type of sucker 
Once copped me a pair from the skateboard shop 
Went home, they didn't fit, then i had re-cop 
give a fukk, yea ya boy rock slip ons 
But I bet i'll snatch ur chick wit my goddamn vans on 
Holla at cha boy, but i can tell ya where i got these 
Vans don't cost G's, real niggas wear these vans (yea...) 

[Hook] 

[Verse 4] 
(Yea, yea, lets go...) 
In my van shoes, but they look like sneakers 
Yea, they old skool, like high-top Adidas 
Now we gettin money, all these niggas wanna be us 
But i don't give a fukk 'cause my whole team see us 
They wouldn't bust a nut in a porno flick 
Black on black, so they won't get dirty 
Lookin like a grown man, feelin like i'm 'bout 30 
Super official, Short blow the whistle 
Talk to my pistol if u got an issue 
Smokin' purple stuff, got my eyes all hazy 
Play dat Young Stunna, dope girls go crazy 
My vans go stupid, skitz-oh-manie 
Better cuff ya chick, slip-ons get ladies 
U can have them coke whites wit them dirty ass laces 
Nigga, vans GO, all u lame niggas face it 
But my vans lime green, yea, i'm flyer than a space ship---Lyrics submitted by babii.
