All my life, I've tried to do what's right
First star I see tonight, please make my wish come true
Why can't we join hands around one tree?
Let live and let it be, make Christmas last forever

When Santa's flying in his magic sleigh
Goes all around the world in just a day
From the north pole to the southern tip
He makes his trip with gifts to give away, hear him say

"It's Christmas, all over the world tonight
It's Christmas, all over the world"

All my life, I learned if I was good
And did everything I should, my dreams would all come true
I can see a special time when we join hands around one tree
And Christmas lasts forever

When Santa's flying in his magic sleigh
Goes all around the world in just a day
From the north pole to the southern tip
He makes his trip with gifts to give away, hear him say

"It's Christmas, all over the world tonight
It's Christmas, all over the world"
It's Christmas, all over the world tonight
It's Christmas, all over the world
It's Christmas, all over the world tonight
It's Christmas, all over the world---Lyrics submitted by Raven Guides.
