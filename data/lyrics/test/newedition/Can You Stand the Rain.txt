On a perfect day, I know that I can count on you
When that's not possible
Tell me, can you weather a storm?

'Cause I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times
She will always, always be right there

Sunny days, everybody loves them
Tell me baby, can you stand the rain?
Storms will come, this we know for sure
(This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain?

Love unconditional, I'm not asking just of you
And girl to make it last
I'll do whatever needs to be done

But I need somebody who will stand by me
When it's tough she won't run
She will always be right there for me

Sunny days, everybody loves them
Tell me baby, can you stand the rain?
(Can you stand it?)
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
Storms will come
(I know, I know, all the days won't be perfect)

This we know for sure
(This we know for sure)
(But tell me, can you stand it?)
Can you stand the rain?
(Can you stand the rain?)

Can you stand the rain?
(This we know for sure)
(No pressure, no pressure from me baby)
Can you stand the rain?
(This we know for sure)
('Cause I want you and I need you and I love you girl)

Can you stand the rain?
(This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain?
(Will you be there for me?)
(This we know for sure)

Come on baby, let's go get wet

(Can you stand the rain?)
Can you stand the rain?
(This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain?
(Will you be there for me?)
(This we know for sure)

Can you stand the rain?
(Storms will come for sure)
(This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain?
(Can you stand the rain?)
(This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain?
(This we know for sure)

Can you stand the rain?
Will you be there girl?
Storms will come for sure
Can you stand the rain?

But I know, I know I'll be right there, yeah---
