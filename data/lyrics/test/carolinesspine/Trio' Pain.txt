She said, "Who answered the phone, I don't understand,
I thought you'd be alone tonight?"
I said, "...the girl who lives here,
she said the band could stay if we bought the beer."
She said. "I don't like the sound of that,
tell me what she looks like - thin or fat?"
I said, "Uh... I can't really say.
What does it matter anyway?"
I said, "It's good to hear your voice,
I really do miss you but we made the right choice."
She said, "I hope you're eating well,
and living here without you is living though hell."
I said, "...well I may be home early,
it'll be a few days before I know surely."
"Shirley! Is that her name?
Is she in love, and do you feel the same?"
No I don't feel the same.
I cannot find a way to make peace with you today.
So where will we be tomorrow?
I busted my ass to make it home
and when I got there she wasn't alone.
She said, "You're home so soon!
I didn't get a chance to clean the room."
I said, "...forget this house...
road cheese calls both man and mouse."
She said, "Don't end it this way!
I really did miss you every day... well...
almost every day... in every way.---Lyrics submitted by kris.
