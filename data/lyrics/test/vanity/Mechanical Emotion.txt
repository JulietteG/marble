All of a sudden, you appear
Insatiable emotion in my mirror, hey!

(chorus #1)

You appear insatiable emotion
(Your choreography has imagination)
Baby, your poetry and motion
Ooh, you know I'm the best
(Who might you be, what's your name?)
The Greatest!

You want to watch my thunderstorm
Ya gotta see my poppin' corn
I participate, end of story
All of a sudden, you delay
Numerical emotion in my middle, hey!

(chorus #2)

You delay my numerical emotion
Baby don't count on devotion
Girl, let's give a rest
I gave more, you gave less

You're anything but ordinary
And I'm getting your attention hard
Your body's shooting X-ray bullets
Fire away, I'm unarmed
And all of a sudden, you push replay
(Replay)
Mechanical emotions in my middle, hey!

(chorus #3)

You display mechanical emotion
(Ahh you're in my symphony)
Baby, in my orchestration
Oh, you keep me a wreck
(Fine! Why? Why? Why? I love you anyway)
Baby, I'm sick of this mess

(spoken French part)

(solo chorus by Morris)

You display mechanical emotion
Baby, in my orhcestration
Oh, you keep me a wreck
Baby, I'm sick of this mess

You display mechanical emotion
Baby, in my orchestration
Oh, you keep me a wreck
Baby, I'm sick of this mess---Lyrics submitted by kevin.
