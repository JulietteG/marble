Some habits are too hard to break
You give in,then you're hooked on what you take
Why don't you come close
I need an overdose
Because you've got me

You got me Under The Influence
of a four-letter word on my mind
You got me Under The Influence
and I'll do anything anytime

My empty nights you fill them up
I don't know when to say I've had enough
Intoxicate me with every kiss you've got
I know I must be

I must be Under The Influence
of a four-letter word on my mind
You got me Under The Influence
and I'll do anything anytime
I must be Under The Influence
of a love that gets sweeter than wine
You got me Under The Influence
and my willpower's so hard to find

I must be Under The Influence
of a four-letter word on my mind
You got me Under The Influence
and I'll do anything anytime
I must be Under The Influence
of a love that gets sweeter than wine
You got me Under The Influence
and my willpower's so hard to find---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
