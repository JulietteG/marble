No no no,
I saw you go go go.
You helped my heart to know,
How our love has grown.
Tears flow flow flow,
Without you nothing's so.

Beautiful,
You're so beautiful.

Here we go,
Staring out the window,
When the feeling's home,
So our love follows.

Beautiful,
You're so beautiful.
Beautiful,
You're so beautiful.---Lyrics submitted by Jake Southgate.
