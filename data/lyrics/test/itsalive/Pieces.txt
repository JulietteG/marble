She said she's over it
Well i guess i already knew
I'm now discovering this awful burning sound
This feelings' shot from me 
So take it, take it back
My minds rebeling and just watch me come undone

What the hell was i thinkin' 
Believing in you, believing in you

Whoa your rippin' me into pieces now, pieces now
Whoa your rippin' me into pieces now, pieces now

Well she loves the taste of vain
It's clear she's already used
I somehow find in her this easy kind of love
This love has teased me 
So shake it, shake it off
My body's needing it, just watch her set me off

Whoa your rippin' me into pieces now, pieces now
Whoa your rippin' me into pieces now, pieces now

Well i can't, i can't
Never will i ever let the things you said get through me
And i won't, i won't 
Never will i let the things you said

Whoa your rippin' me into pieces now, pieces now

Whoa your rippin' me into pieces now, pieces now
Whoa your rippin' me into pieces now, pieces now---Lyrics submitted by jeff.
