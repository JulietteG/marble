My mouth is empty
There's nothing left to say
Was it that easy, to let me fade away?
Your love is blind, but who needs eyes today?

She's got these angel eye's on a devil's face
A tortured soul dressed up in lace
If love's a crime, she's got some time to face
Well I've been trying to get this off my chest
While hanging onto the moments we have left

Well I'll keep my tongue between my teeth and bottle these words inside of me
I know it's nothing new
Yeh I know we're through
But I'm still a fool for you

The shed is heavy
I feel the flames within
It's strong and steady
A smile to pretend
Your fate exists with balled up fists towards me

I've got these beggar palms in golden gloves
I'm on my knee's decayed by love
If change is good, I'd like to meet someone that could
Well I've been dying to taste this bitter end
I'm trying not just to wash you off my skin

Well I'll keep my tongue between my teeth and bottle these words inside of me
I know it's nothing new
Yeh I know we're through
But I'm still a fool for you

Well I'll keep my tongue between my teeth and bottle these words inside of me
I know it's nothing new
Yeh I know we're through
But I'm still a fool for you

Well I'll keep my tongue between my teeth and bottle these words inside of me
I know it's nothing new
Yeh I know we're through
But I'm still a fool for you---Lyrics submitted by Ashy.
