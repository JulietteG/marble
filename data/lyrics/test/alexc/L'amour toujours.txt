I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Because I'll live to love you someday
You'll be my baby and we'll fly away

And I'll fly with you-ou-ou
I'll fly with you-ou-ou
I'll fly with you...

Everybody that wanna come on
And put your hands up real high
We like them birds in the air
Cause we so fly
Dandala Alex C.
Combination new hot
We know you hear the sounds
Can't deny it - why try?
Do you really wanna test that weed
The best throughout the whole land
Get the dancefloor packed and Alex C.
Will make you f*cking dance

Every day and every night
I always dream that you are by my side
Oh, baby, every day and every night
Well I said everything is gonna be alright

I'll fly with you-ou-ou
I'll fly with you-ou-ou
I'll fly with you...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
