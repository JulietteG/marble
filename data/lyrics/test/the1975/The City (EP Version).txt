Don't call it a fight when you know it's a war
With nothing but your t-shirt on
And go sit on the bed 'cause you know that you want to
You got pretty eyes, but I know you're wrong

And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade
And go lie on the floor if you want
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was
"You're too strong, too strong"
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong

Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is (city is)
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is

Yeah, counting cards was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got good with his 4's and his 2's
That community service was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got sick on the floor and his shoes

Oh and she said, "It's your birthday
Are you feeling all right?"
The next one's the MD, you'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there
And you said he felt snide
You hope that that boy will be all right

Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is (city is)
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is

Yeah, well she said, "It's your birthday
Are you feeling all right?"
The next one's the MD, you'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there
You said he felt snide
You hope that that boy will be all right

Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is (city is)
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
