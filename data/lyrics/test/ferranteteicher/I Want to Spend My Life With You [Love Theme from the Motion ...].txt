Moon so bright, night so fine,
Keep your heart here with mine
Life's a dream we are dreaming

Race the moon, catch the wind,
Ride the night to the end,
Seize the day, stand up for the light

Ref:
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do

Heroes rise, heroes fall,
Rise again, win it all,
In your heart, can't you feel the glory?

Through our joy, through our pain,
We can move the worlds again,
Take my hand, dance with me.

Ref:
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life i ever do
I will want nothing else to see me through
If I can spend my lifetime loving you

Though we know we will never come again
Where there is love, life begins
Over and over again

Save the night, save the day,
Save the love, come what may,
Love is worth everything we pay.

Ref:
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life i ever do
I want nothing else to see me through
If that is all in life i ever do
I will want nothing else to see me through
If I can spend my lifetime loving you---Lyrics submitted by M()3@Z.
