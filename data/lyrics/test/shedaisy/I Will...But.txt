I won't be ignored
I won't be bored
Hey!

I won't be your dirty secret
I won't be your cure-on pill
I won't run to fetch the water
Just to tumble down the hill
I won't be your friday paycheck
I won't be the prize you flaunt
I won't be your Martha Stewart, baby
Or your all night resturaunt

Chorus:
But I will, I will, I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a women should(I will)
But I will, I will, I will be the whole shebang
Yeah you know I will

But I won't be your crutch to lean on
I won't wear stiletto heals
I won't walk a mile in your shoes
Just so I know how it feels
I won't be your obligation
I won't be your barbie doll
I won't be the portrait of perfection
To adorn your wall

Chorus

HHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You know you know I will

I won't be your lifetime girlfriend
I won't be just one of the guys
I won't be your mama's favorite
I refuse to be last in line

Chorus x2

I will I will yeah!

You know I will you know you know I will x2 yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Aubrey.
