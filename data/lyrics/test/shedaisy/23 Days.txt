My name looks unfamiliar
On this barking marquee sign
and the love that I've been gettin'
I can't really call it mine
This blacktop ribbon winds me
Down an unforgiving road
When I think about my baby
On the other side of home
I say oh, oh, oh, I gotta go
I say oh, oh, oh

(chorus)
Hey, hey, hey, on my way
23 days gone by
Why can't eagles fly
Hey, hey, hey
Love don't break
23 nights of blue
Carry me back to you -yeah

Another song get scribbled
On this napkin in my lap
As we burn another circle
On this God-forsaken map
The droning of the engines
And the moaning of the wheels
It's a fortuneteller's melody
It's how you make me feel
I say oh, oh, oh, I gotta go
I say oh, oh, oh

(chorus)
Hey, hey, hey I'm on my way
23 days gone by
Why can't eagles fly
Hey, hey, hey
Love don't break
23 nights of blue
Carry me back to you- yeah

Yeah, Albuquerque's never felt colder
One mile higher
All the way to Boulder
Oklahoma City always looks pretty
'Cause it's halfway home
Yeah, windshield wipers, broken white lines
Lord don't let me lose my mind
23 days to Tennessee time
And I'm back to you
Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

(chorus)
Hey, hey, hey, on my way
23 days gone by
Why can't eagles fly
Hey, hey, hey
Love don't break
23 nights of blue
Carry me back to you- yeah

Whoa, whoa - whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa - whoa, whoa - yeah---Lyrics submitted by Becca.
