Never thought I'd be in this place
It's someone else's life I'm living
Wish I were living a lie

The hardest part is when the bough breaks
Falling down, and then forgiving
You didn't kiss me goodbye

I'm choking on the words I didn't get to say
And pray I get the chance one day

I still run, I still swing open the door
I still think you'll be there, like before
Doesn't everybody out there know to never come 'round?
Some things a heart won't listen to
I'm still holding out for you

I can hear you smile in the dark
I can even feel your breathing
But daylight chases the ghost

I see your coat and I fall apart
To those hints of you, I'm clinging
Now's when I need them most

I should get up, dry my eyes, and move ahead
At least, that's what you would have said, oh

I still run, I still swing open the door
I still think you'll be there, like before
Doesn't everybody out there know to never come 'round?
Some things a heart won't listen to
I'm still holding out for you

Faithfully, I trace your name while you sleep
It's the only true comfort I feel

I still run, I still swing open the door
I still think you'll be there, like before

I still run, I still swing open the door
I still think you'll be there, like before
Doesn't everybody out there know to never come 'round?
Some things a heart won't listen to
I'm still holding out, out for you
(Holding out) Holding out, for you---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
