I give what I need to give
I take what I need to take
I live how I see fit
I choose to follow through

My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you

I lie in my own contempt
Subdued by relentlessness
I tried to fight the thought
But I caved
I gave my freedom
Resigned it all to you
What would you give to know it never goes away

My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you

One life
Never own it
Enslaved like a servant
Once the bottom breaks you never float the same
One shake
To a tremble
Con-man from within you
I can lie to myself but I can't lie to you

My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you
My only crime is loving you---Lyrics submitted by jose.
