(Chorus)
If I didn't have you in my world
What a lonely place my world would be
If I didn't have you in my world
I think I'd just pack up and leave

It seems like I've waited a lifetime
To find someone special like you
If you ever walked out of my life
I don't know what I would do
'Cause

(Repeat Chorus)

You gave me a reason for living
The first time I looked in your eyes
I shuddered to think what might happen
If you ever told me goodbye
'Cause

(Repeat Chorus)

If I didn't have you in my world---Lyrics submitted by sandi miller.
