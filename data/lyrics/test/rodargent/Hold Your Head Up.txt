And if it's bad, don't let it get you down, you can take it.
And if it hurts, don't let them see you cry, you can make it.

CHORUS ~
Hold your head up,
Aahh,
whoa, and hold your up,
Aahh,
whoa, and hold your up,
Aahh, whoa,
and Hold your head high ~
repeat ~

And if they stare, just let them know their eyes on you move me
and if they shout, don't let it change a thing that your doing.

chorus ~

Hold your head up
(repeat 14 times)

and if they stare just let them know their eyes on you move me,
and if they shout, don't let it change a thing that your doing.

repeat chorus ~ (fade out)---Lyrics submitted by Terrie.
