I ain't never seen her before 
One pretty little trick tryna 
Run out through the back door 
So I step to the left, puffed out the chest 
Kid so fly had to show em that ass 
That action, distraction 
Make this a chain reaction 
She was more than a 10 her 
And her friends made there own 
Money and had there own ends 
Yow yip yip yow come here lemme 
Show you a pretty little face 
it's more then, now dip dip 
Dow you stay here and let you girl go 
I don't mean, mean no harm 
And I wanna show you the rude 
Boy charm and Yep give me 
The signal and I'm on it 
That there body need wronging 

You know that chick, she's fine 
You know she's as bad 
As she looks, she's mine 
She's all I want and I need, no lie 
Ain't wastin' no time, you see her 
Going around cause she's a... 
Hold up! Wait a minute 
That chick, that chick right there 
That chick that chick right there 
That girl 
That chick, that chick right there 
that chick, that chick right there 
Oh no 
That chick, that chick right there 
that chick, that chick right there 
Ooh that girl 
That chick, that chick right there 
That chick, that chick right there 

She seem like a quiet girl, you know 
I don't buy it not for a second, 
Your mark (get set) 
Everything you protect is out 
And I'm tryna see what you all about 
Are you a Gemini or a Leo? 
I'm a Taurus check out my Eagle 
A little famous so 
Check out your teevo 
And we see the pretty gal go 
We go oh 
Yo, I'm on a good pump now 
Had quick check, lemme put 
You in check, I'm a vet 
When it comes to the sweat 
Running down your neck 
From that DJ set 
Pull up, pull up 
Blonde ready a brunette 
Pull up, pull up 
I see you rolling it like roulette 
Pull up, pull up 
From the front view 
To the silhouette 
You a threat, even I'll 
Have that body in debt 

She a little more to the left, to the left 
Skirt showing all the goodies 
In the lasenza she got left 
Now she off to the right, to the right 
With about 5 guys 
Following behind her all night 
She putting those seams to the test 
It seems those seams cannot 
Cover the breasts 
Heart pumping like a 
20 minute workout 
She in control keep captain Kerk out 
See her twerk that, see 
The body bounce 
You know how she only 
Dip when it really counts 
Animal prints on under garments 
Give me one touch I'm on it---
