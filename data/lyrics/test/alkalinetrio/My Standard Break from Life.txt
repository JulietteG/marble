I've got a regular problem,
So my standard break from life is in order,
I'm having trouble making sen-ten-ces,
I'm older but I don't feel any smarter,

Because I don't know what I said to you,
And now you're pissed at you-know-who,
And I guess I deserve it,
Wish I could waste my time without wasting all your time,

I try to leave a good impression,
But it's hard when my obsession's in a wine glass,
And when you're only twenty-three,
It's not attractive to complain about your sore back,

Yes I could bitch until my eyes are blue,
And you're in bed with someone new,
And I guess you deserve him,
Wish I could waste my time without wasting all your time,

You say I'm fixable,
A classic case,
Lack of will,
I say I don't wanna try,
I'd rather sit here all night,

I've got a motivation problem,
So my standard break from life is taking longer,
Spent over thirty hours in this bed,
In two days I guess I could've phoned her,

But now that I'm awake I'd rather take my drink and walk down to the lake,
And beg the sky for lightning bolts,
I can't waste my time without wasting all your time,

You say It's fixable,
A classic case,
Lack of will,
I say I don't wanna try,
I'd rather sit here all night,---Lyrics submitted by Brendon.
