I've got it now, a thorn in my side the size of a Cadillac. 
Drive it through, cause backin' up now would be next to impossible. 
I had it all. 
When I was with you I forgot about everything.
Eighteen months, eighteen months seems like fucking eternity... 
but you'll be there, to dry my eyes when I breathe you in. 
in ninety seven... in ninety seven. 
I've got it now, like a thorn in my side the size of a Cadillac. 
Drive it through, cause backin' up now would be next to impossible. 
I had it all. When I was with you I forgot about everything. 
Eighteen months... I won't breathe for eighteen months. 
I don't deserve this,
I don't deserve this, 
I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this. 
No, I don't deserve this, no.---Lyrics submitted by David.
