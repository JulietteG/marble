Crack my head open on your kitchen floor
To prove to you that I have brains
Meanwhile tin men are led by little girls
Down golden roads that lead to nowhere

Fine time to fake a seizure
Feel your mouth on mine, you're saving me

Whatever happened to that silly dream you had?
I want to make it real
I'd love to rub your back
Like a plane crash that never hits the ground
I fall in love with you
I'm nose over tail for you
Your voice like the sound of sirens to a house on fire
You're saving me---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
