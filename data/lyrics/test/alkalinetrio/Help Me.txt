Here you find me in between
Heaven and Hell my dear
Where nothing's what it seems
It's just as well I fear
I'm giving you the creeps
And a farewell kiss to go into the unknown

Saw you standing there
Outside the music hall
You come out for some air
Uncertain curtain call
And everyone just stared
When you took the stage that night
Something's not right

You're up there
Took the stairs
To the stars all alone
You left all the lights burning
But nobody's home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart too long
Now they sing along

Help me, Help me won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song?
Help me, Help me, somebody help me
Save me from myself

Here I find you in between
Heaven and Hell again
Where nothing's what it seems
It's just as well my friend
I'm giving me the creeps
And a farewell to arms, and legs, and heads, and hearts

You're up there
Took the stairs
To the stars all alone
You left all the lights burning
But nobody's home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart too long
Now they sing along

Help me, Help me, won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song?
Help me, Help me, somebody help me
Save me from myself, Take me from this Hell

Now they sing along
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You're up there
Took the stairs
To the stars all alone
You left all the lights burning
But nobody's home
I believe they deceived your tuneful heart too long
Now they sing along

Help me, Help me won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song?
Help me, Help me, somebody help me
Save me from myself

Help me, Help me won't you?
Sing me, sing me one last song?
Help me, Help me, somebody help me
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Save me from myself
Take me from this Hell---Lyrics submitted by Brandon.
