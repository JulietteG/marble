Over and out of it for one more plane ride out
Not sure, and never was if this will all head south, or what
Wait here a month or two will pass, I'm sure I won't
Faith dear, enough to get you by until we're home

I wish I don't wish I still smoked
I wish, I wrote you one original note

Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again

Over and out of it for one more plane ride out
Not sure, and never was if this will all head south

I wish I don't wish I still smoked
I wish I wrote you one original note

Take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again
take me home, tuck me in
Moon go down, do it again---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
