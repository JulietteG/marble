I guess Ill always stop and see you
And well run into each others lives
Yeah, I guess. although it tears me up inside.
Everytime it burns my eyes with tears.
But I know youre worth the pain.
Ive so much more to gain by waiting for you.

Youre going away but youre not going far
So if he decides to leave you alone and crying,
You know Im still here, the faithful one,
Waiting for a message from kathlene
Then Ill come.. faster..
Than I ever thought that I could run..
Cause i...
I need you more than I ever thought that I could need someone
Someone someone someone else

I know I will always stop and see you
And well run into each others fucked up lives
Yeah, I guess. although it tears me up inside.
Everytime it burns my eyes with tears.
But your waking up is the start of my lost cause.
And then you decide to leave me alone and crying.
But you know Im still here, the faithful one,
Waiting for a message from kathlene
Then Ill come.. faster..
Than I ever thought that I could run..
Cause i...
I need you more than I ever thought that I could need someone
Someone someone someone else---Lyrics submitted by David.
