There's someone down below blowing you a kiss
they watch from their windowas all arms fall to their sides all eyes fix
on the death of tomorrow
and you found everything you need to make a life complete
completely revolting
and they had safety and relief
to say i love the street
i see you in line everyday

You had time to waste
And I'm not sorry
such a basket case
hide the cutlery
I had time to kill
it's dead and buried
you've got guts to spill
but know i'm trustworthy

these creatures are waking up in these dark trees
they're waiting like vultures
and eyes roll back, turn white in time to feed
they salivate in hunger
for you and everything they need to make a death complete
completely unnatural
and salvation lies behind those dead eyes 
that watch you while you sleep every night and...

You had time to waste
and i'm not sorry
such a basket case
hide the cutlery
I had time to kill
it's dead and buried
you've got guts to spill
but know i'm trustworthy [... x2]---Lyrics submitted by Kadi.
