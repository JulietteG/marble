You've given me faith
But love isn't fearful
You found the words
That I couldn't say
You touched my hand when I walked away
Just when I though you were gone
You came back, back in my life like a song

You, you're all I want
And all that I need
Time's wasting away
I'm down on my knees
Love is all we need be

Another day feeling sorrow
There's nothing to lose
There's always tomorrow
And with this hand in here
I found my way
Just when I though you were gone
You came back, back in my life like a song

You, you're all I want
And all that I need
And when you smile 
Smile with your heart
It's plain to see

From the brother which we passed
I can see it clear as glass
There is eternity
In the things we cannot see
Fort the answer lies
Within a simple grain of sand

Just when I though you were gone
You came back, back in my life like a song

You, you're all I want
And all that I need
Time's wasting away
I'm down on my knees
Time's wasting away
And when you smile 
Smile with your heart
It's plain to see---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
