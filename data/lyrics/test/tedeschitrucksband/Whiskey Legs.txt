Mother feet ain't whiskey legs
Come and let me like a subway train
Read of language fill my ease of pain
I'm laughing out loud 'cause I feel the same

To tell the all
But I'm willing to run.

All this crazy
They keep it hangin' long.

Looking for smoke darling no joke
Here Bill just come and help me!
Won't leave me alone
Summer's past and I lose us [?]
A slummer's call in the [?] dream.

To tell the all
But I'm willing to run.

Over the rivers I go
Time to get me, I'm going home
And what is the day? And what is the night?
Dancing the blue to make it alright.

How many dreams will you let full eye?
Before you will choose on the right.

Money feed and whiskey legs
Coming at me like a subway chain
Uh but cross the spirit as a clocks got three
Daddy calls and following me.

Lucky the day when is night
Jumping the blue to make it alright

How many dreams will you let full eye?
Before you will choose on the right.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
