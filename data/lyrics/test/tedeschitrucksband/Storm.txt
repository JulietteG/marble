All talk all day
Down the west highway
Liar burning in my neighborhood
All that I say but it never would
..got to move away
I didn't believe him
That I'm gonna stay
Don't wanna turn to that place there too high
Deal me a seat
I've waited all this time

When starts highland
Starts that moving in
Storm will rise up
No where land this way
Formal rising, hotels coming back
You can't deny it
...at me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
