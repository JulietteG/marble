I roll and I tumble, cried the whole night long
Yes I roll and I tumble, I cried the whole night long
I got up this morning, feeling that something going on wrong

Well now want you to love me baby, or please let me be
Yes love me baby, or please let me be
If you don't like my peaches please don't shake my tree

Well I want you to love me baby, and come on and say you'll be mine
I want you to love me baby, come on and say you'll be mine
If you don't like my potatoes, please don't dig up my vine---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
