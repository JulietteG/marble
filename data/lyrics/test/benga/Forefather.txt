Lights Action 
Couple more bottles for the man-dem 
Jessie J, do it like the man-dem 
Dollar bills throw it like a tantrum 
Lights Action 
Couple Marilyn's no not the Manson's 
Big bottles poppin' what? Bigger than a magnum? 
Yeah bitch, what? And it ain't a Lanson 

Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Where's my dogs at? 
Where's my fuckin' great danes? 
Twisted firestarter like some old skool prodigy 
Take a pop at me? 
You niggas my proteges yeah 
1-0-0 put the comma then sizzla them haters 
Fire bun the whole'a them 
You can hate me now like I was Nas and them 
You can hate me now like I was puff and them 

Them them nuh ready dem ah road rat, know that 
No roll deep flow own that 
110th street no womack 
Cross 3 0, own that shit, St. Olaves 
Vroom vroom vroom'in on the A-13 
Boom Boom Boom'in bass dirty 
Zoom Zoom Zoom'in 
Boom Boom Pum in'a the place 
Baseline overdose 
Gyal dem in some open toes 
Them man say they does this shit 
But them man some Pinocchio's 
I was in the dance rocking like Akademics & Prada's 
Tell these motherfuckers I'ma grime forefather 

We get it you gas 
Apple juice in your old champs 
New beamer mums house 
Chandeliers in council flats 
You man talk but you don't ball out 
We refill when the drinks all out 
Too many gangsters, not enough gyal 
Too much dancefloor, not enough skanks 
From EQ Power house 
Touch Mic bun it down 
It's Kano in the house 
It's Kano in the house 
Youse copy or cats 
Follow fashion youse all sad 
Borrow this with your borrowed swag 
Two bag suit and it ain't off rack 

Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Kano 
Same Kano that bodied niggas on the radio 

Kanye West can't dress like me 
Hugh Hef can't sex like me 
Evian can't fresh like me 
Might see me in a crisp white tee 
Murder the dance Rest I.P. 
Balenciaga's dress my feet 
Young Sam Jack effect I need 
Star Wars money yeah Jedi P's 
Breath 
Gimme the grey goose I'll rave to the death 
Brother think of the papers I'm able to spend 
When you think of the hating you may wanna send 
Nigga do me a favour and pay me respect 
Never been about majors and taking a check 
'Coz I've been about ages and K's a legend 
Making the papers with papers and pens 

We get it you gas 
Apple juice in your old champs 
New beamer mums house 
Chandeliers in council flats 
You man talk but you don't ball out 
We refill when the drinks all out 
Too many gangsters, not enough gyal 
Too much dancefloor, not enough skanks 
From EQ Power house 
Touch Mic bun it down 
It's Kano in the house 
It's Kano in the house 
Youse copy or cats 
Follow fashion youse all sad 
Borrow this with your borrowed swag 
Two bag suit and it ain't off rack 

Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Kano 
Same Kano that bodied niggas on the radio 
Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Sounding like some old skool K.A. 
Kano 
Same Kano that bodied niggas on the radio---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
