Curse the day, I'm cursing
All the way and back again
In to town to meet my maker
4 feet tall and full of sin
Feeling like I'm no ones monster
I lift him up, get my revenge
Now I'm free, but I feel your revelry

I can't shake it off, I can't shake it
All these feelings in my head
I want silence, no more anger
I wish I was God instead
Was he afraid of his own image
I don't care what the good book says
Now I'm free, but I feel your revelry

And I saw her through the ashes
Face is white, spirit self
Could she be my perfect monster
Together we rule this hell
Now I'm afraid, I'm afraid
And I will dance, revelry
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
And I will dance, revelry
I will see the light through the clouds
Out in the corner, ghostly scare
Radiate this place, I will dance
Stand alone, last all morning
First to leave this place
I will dance, revelry ---Lyrics submitted by carl thorgerson.
