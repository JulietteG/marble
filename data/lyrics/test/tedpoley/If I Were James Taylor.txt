When Im away from you
Colors fade to black and all that I feel is blue
Now Im counting the minutes till I see you again
And Ill come home runnin just as fast as I can

Now I close my eyes
To see you clearer
And I think of you 
So youll seem nearer
Id write how much I miss you but Id take way too long
If I were James Taylor I could finish this song

When I dream I hold you in my arms
All my troubles fade and my problems seem small
A heart can break so easy when you split it in two
And my heart always skips a beat when I think of you

So I close my eyes
To see you clearer
And I think of you 
So youll seem nearer
Id write how much I miss you but Id take way to long
If I were James Taylor I could finish this song

I dont know why I find it so hard
To express myself and get my true feelings out
Any normal words can only get in the way
But sweet baby James would know the right things to say

Just  close my eyes
To see you clearer
And I think of you 
So youll seem nearer
Id tell you all you mean to me but Id take too long
If I were James Taylor I could finish this song---Lyrics submitted by Cheryl Perkins.
