Lord, here i am again,d own on my knees in prayer
And Lord, you promised me you would always meet me there
nows theres a mountain up ahead, that I cant seem to climb
but i'm praying for the strength to try it one more time

Lord dont move that mountain
just give me strength to climb
for if you should move each mountain
I might grow weaker every time
just like your Son jesus, took
the Cross up Calvery's hill
Lord don't move that mountain 
so I may better do your will

Now if i had no mountains
Lord I might forget to pray
and if there were no triumphs
well I might even stray
but I know the higher the mountain
the sweeter the victory
Lord ever remind me, you will
walk beside of me

Ohhh Oh Oh

Lord dont move that mountain
just give me strength to climb
for if you should move each mountain
I might grow weaker every time
and just as your Son jesus, took
the Cross up Calvery's hill
Lord don't move that mountain 
so I may better do your will

Lord dont move that mountain
so I may better do your will---Lyrics submitted by becky v.
