In search of a child they travel so far
Led by a star to a place of joy
Now the wise men tell a beautiful story
Describing the glory of a baby boy

Hope has hands
Freedom has feet
Truth will stand
The word will speak
The holy and lowly will finally embrace
For love has a heartbeat
And grace has a face

Compassion has a tear
Joy has a laughter
And here ever after peace has a smile
Redemptions blood has veins to flow in
A temple to glow in
Light is a child

Hope has hands
Freedom has feet
Truth will stand the world will sleep
The holy and lowly will finally embrace
For love has a heartbeat
And grace has a face

The holy and lowly will finally embrace
For love has a heartbeat
Love has a heartbeat
And grace has a face---Lyrics submitted by Robert.
