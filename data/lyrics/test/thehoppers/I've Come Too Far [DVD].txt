I've come too far to look back, again
There is nothing behind me
All the pleasures I used to love
Have all faded from view
There's a new day ahead for me
My heartache is over, you see
I left it at Calvary
Where my new life began

I've come too far to look back
My feet have walked through the valley
I've climbed mountains, crossed rivers
Desert places I've known
But I'm nearing the home shore
The redeemed are rejoicing
And Heaven's Angels are singing
I've come too far to look back

Look around, there's unhappiness
Some see no reason for living
Life will give you a broken dream
Full of heartache and fear
Turn around, don't look back again
Face the new day before you
Place your heartache in Jesus hand
He will mend broken dreams

I've come too far to look back
My feet have walked through the valley
And I've climbed mountains, crossed rivers
Desert places I've known
But I'm nearing the home shore
The redeemed are rejoicing
And Heaven's Angels are singing
I've come too far to look back

But I'm nearing the home shore
The redeemed are rejoicing
And Heaven's Angels are singing
I've come too far to look back
Too far to look back---Lyrics submitted by Ron.
