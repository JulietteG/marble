Don't ask me to explain for you
How one can start again
How hardened hearts could soften like a child
Don't ask me how to reason out
All of the mysteries of life
Or how to face all of it's problems with a smile

Go ask the man who's found the way
Through tangled roads back home to stay
When all communications were destroyed
Go ask the child who's walking now
Who once was cripple then somehow
Her useless legs were made to jump for joy
Go ask the one who's burned out mind
Has been restored, I think you'll find
The question's not important as before
Don't ask me if He's good or bad
I only know the guilt I had is gone
And I can't tell you anymore

Don't ask me to explain to you
Why I know God is there
And I absolutely know that He will care for you
Don't ask me why someone so great
Would choose to walk with me
And trade my broken life for one that's new

Go ask the child who's got a dad
To love away the hurt he had
Before this man called Jesus touched their lives
Go ask the one whose fears have fled
Whose churning heart was quieted
When someone whispered peace to all her strife
Go ask the man to tell you more
Whose life was just a raging war
Inside himself,  until the Saviour came
I don't pretend to be so wise
I only know He touched my eyes
And nothing else will ever be the same
I don't pretend to be so wise
I only know He touched my eyes
And nothing else will ever be the same
No nothing else will ever be the same---Lyrics submitted by Ron.
