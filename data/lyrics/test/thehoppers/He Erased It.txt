Verse 1:
Ever since Eden
Death has been waiting
Every life is measured out in years

I've known its' sorrow
I've felt its' shadow
And I have fought my fears

I know it comes for each of us
Yet I have hope in knowing that when it does

Chorus:
In the garden Jesus faced it and He chose His Father's will
The next day He embraced it with open arms on Calvary's Hill
And death thought it had won until God's only Son
Left the grave alive again

In the garden He faced it on Calvary He embraced it
And I praise God, three days later He erased it

Verse 2:
I have a Savior, what reassurance 
Knowing that He did what I could not
He fought the battle, now I don't have to
His grace is all I've got
I'm not a victim anymore 
For death is not an ending, its just a door

Chorus:
In the garden Jesus faced it and He chose His Father's will
The next day He embraced it with open arms on Calvary's Hill
And death thought it had won until God's only Son
Left the grave alive again

In the garden He faced it on Calvary He embraced it
And I praise God, three days later He erased it

Bridge:
Death's hold has ended, its' strength is gone
Though I'll go through it, I'll live on

Chorus:
In the garden Jesus faced it and He chose His Father's will
The next day He embraced it with open arms on Calvary's Hill
And death thought it had won until God's only Son
Left the grave alive again

In the garden He faced it on Calvary He embraced it
And I praise God, three days later He erased it (2x)---Lyrics submitted by G Goines.
