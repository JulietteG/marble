Verse 1:
How could he hang on that cross
How could he suffer and die
How could he pay the ultimate cost
There is but one reason why

Chorus:
Blame it on love
Unconditional Love
Men held the nails 
When that hammer fell
But as strong as hate was
He climbed up that hill
By his own will
So blame it on love

Verse 2:
Why do I shout like I do
When somebody mentions his name
And why does my heart break completely in two
When one don't believe why he came

Chorus

Men held the nails when that hammer fell
But as strong as hate was
He climbed up that hill by his own well
So blame it on love
Unconditional love 
Blame it on Love---Lyrics submitted by Emory Pernell.
