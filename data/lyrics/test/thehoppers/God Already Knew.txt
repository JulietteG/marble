 (v. 1)
Before the light of day ever touched the sky,
God already knew he would bring a sunrise,
God already knew.
Before the children of Israel faced the enemy
God already knew he would part the Red Sea,
God already knew.

(Chorus)
Trust the heart of a Savior who loves me when you don't know what to do.
On the day you face life's biggest trial
Know that God already knew. God already knew.

(v. 2)
Before the son of God ever healed the lame
God already knew he would walk again,
God already knew.
Before my Savior ever died on Calvary,
God already knew He would die just for me
God already knew

(v. 3)
There's coming a day when you just won't see why
you face the attack of the enemy
remember all of these things God already knew.
We grow through the trials we face along the way
when we walk by faith trusting God each day,
God already knew. ---Lyrics submitted by shikashe.
