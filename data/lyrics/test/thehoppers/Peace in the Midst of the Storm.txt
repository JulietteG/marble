Verse 1
Even though the winds arent still, waves continue tossing me
From the storm I call His name, for relief from things distressing me
Now so quietly it comes, strength to find my course again
Though He does much for me, His sweetest gift will always be

Chorus
Peace in the midst of the storm
Peace in the midst of the storm
I cry to Him for mercy and His great love takes the fall, of
Peace in the midst of the storm

Verse 2
What tomorrows storm may hold, joy & sadness coming day by day
But I will not be afraid, even though some storms will come my way
Let my enemy be sure, I will not be lost at sea
Therell never come a time that with prayer I cannot find---Lyrics submitted by Janis Hagerty.
