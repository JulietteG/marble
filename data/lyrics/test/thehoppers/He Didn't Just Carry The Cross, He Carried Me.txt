Once upon His back He knew,
This was the beginning of the end.
With every fragile step he grew,
More and more determined to finish it.

The world saw a man with a tree on His back,
And they laughed.
But God saw His Son who He loved,
Carry more than that.

Oh, He didn't just carry a cross, He carried me.
He didn't just count the cost, He counted me.
So much has been said of what happened at Calvary,
Oh but I believe,
He didn't just carry a cross, He carried me. 

Mercy held my broken heart, 
close against His shoulders as He wept.
Love beyond a moment scarred the hands and feet,
of one I never met.

The world saw a man die a martyr between two thieves,
But God saw a lamb bridge the gap of eternity.

Oh, He didn't just carry a cross, He carried me.
He didn't just count the cost, He counted me.
So much has been said of what happened at Calvary,
Oh but I believe,
He didn't just carry a cross, He carried me.

So much has been said of what happened at Calvary,
Oh but I believe,
He didn't just carry a cross, 
Oh no, He didn't just carry a cross,
No He didn't just carry a cross, He carried me.
He carried me.---Lyrics submitted by Amy Hall.
