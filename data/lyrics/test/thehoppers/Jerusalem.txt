John saw a City that could not be hid
John saw this City, oh yes he did
John caught a glimpse of the Golden Throne
Tell me all about it, go right on
Around the Throne he saw the Crystal Sea
There's got to be more, what will it be
I want to go to that City he saw
New Jerusalem

Jerusalem
I want to walk your streets that are golden
And I want to run, where the Angels have trod
Jerusalem
I want to rest on the banks of your river
In that City, City of God

John saw the lion lay down by the lamb
I want to know everything about that land
John saw the day, but he did not see night
The Lamb of God, well, He must be the light
And he saw the Saints worship the Great I Am
Crying worthy, worthy is the Lamb
I want to go to that City he saw
New Jerusalem

Jerusalem
I want to walk your streets that are golden
And I want to run, where the Angels have trod
Jerusalem
I want to rest on the banks of your river
In that City, the City of God

Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Sing for the night is o'er
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna forever, forevermore

Jerusalem
I want to walk your streets that are golden
And I want to run, where the Angels have trod
Jerusalem
I want to rest on the banks of your river
In that City, City of God
The City of God
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
City of God
It's the City of God---Lyrics submitted by Ron.
