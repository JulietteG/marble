A breath of fresh air, that's what you are to me
When I need that room to breathe, you're a part of me
You're always right there, I look into your eyes and I see
How hard it is to fight what's meant to be

I'm giving in, can't fight a long so strong
Girl, don't stop, keep it coming on and on
You're like sweet music to that same old song
And the hook of love is all I hear

Over and over 
I love you, girl
And I've yet to find someone that comes close to you
Over and over
You're my whole world

Hey, girl, I like the way you cover love's ground
It shows you've got stability
And those fringe benefits, baby, keep me from sneaking around
Got to help each other fight temptation
Have you ever noticed the games that people play?
Trying to get next to love without getting involved
Girl, let's take it further, I'm talking all the way
And I'll show you love's ups and downs, ins and outs

Over and over
No matter how many times a day
I'll never get enough of your love
I'll tell you over and over and over again
Over and over
I love you, girl
And I know now what it means to speak those words
Over and over
I'll tell you, girl

Over and over
Over and over
You're my whole world

I need no more convincing
As far as I'm concerned
You're all the woman I will ever need
When love is this good
I could go on talking forever
But forever is just not enough time to tell you

Over and over
Oh, I need you, baby
I love you
Over and over
Nobody does what you do to me
Over and over
No matter how many times a day
I'll never get enough of your love
I'll tell you over and over and over again
Over and over
You know I'm yours
And we'll always keep that door open to love---Lyrics submitted by Teixeira.
