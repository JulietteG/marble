Better now that summer is over
I'm not gonna tell if you don't
Rather wear this sea on my shoulders
Than trust my old umbrella and jump
As the pavement sinks
Autumn rings
Feel my limp
Heart dancing

Volcano swing
I'm erupting
My ground is turning
I keep burning
Everything
Volcano please
You're my decease
My core is aching
I can't shake him
Out of me
Go back to sleep

Calling for the wind to come find me
Ship me back to Florence tonight
Dragging all our mirrors behind me
The tide won't ever get back inside
Where the lava lies
Watch it rise
Keep my eyes
Hypnotized

Volcano swing
I'm erupting
My ground is turning
I keep burning
Everything
Volcano please
You're my disease
My core is aching
I can't shake him
Out of me
Go back to sleep
