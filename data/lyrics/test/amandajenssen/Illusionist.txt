Im on the backside
of the moon
Still hoping someday
it will bloom
Here
Dont try to count them
Cause you cant know
How many days
that I have spent cold

It dont ever matter if
Im an illusionist
Talk
He doesnt talk
And look the lies in here
If I make them disappear
Talk
Will he then talk

Black water radar
doesnt show
Happy is a longer way to go
Still
I never told you
cause I cant stall
For every star
there is a black hole

It dont ever matter if
Im an illusionist
Talk
He doesnt talk
And look at the lies in here
If I make them disappear
Talk
Will he then talk?

Cautious hymn
Dont mind him
Its just my strain
Talking

Illusion---
