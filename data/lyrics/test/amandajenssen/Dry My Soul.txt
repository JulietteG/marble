Dry my soul, Dry my soul, Dry my soul,
Gone Dry my soul, causes Im all alone
Dry my soul, Dry my soul, Dry my soul,
Gone Dry my soul, cause I'm all alone
My baby, My baby,
Can see Im blind, Youre make me
My baby, You paint me blue
My baby, My baby,
Can see Im blind, Youre make me
My baby, You paint me blue

Or I'll be work in digital hour
to put my blues in, each aim you call
Guvnor on my head, youre in the night off
its all been flooded
come in sense, stall my fight
Come dry my soul, Dry my soul, Dry my soul,
Gone Dry my soul, causes Im all alone
My baby, My baby,
Can see Im blind Youre make me
My baby, You paint me blue
My baby, My baby,
Can see Im blind, Youre make me
My baby, You paint me blue

Youre in this big shoes, shuffle in frown
Can breeze your whispers, all over town
Can tell the deeper is is a five of agree
My be a day friends, either wait make me bleed

Dry my soul, Dry my soul, Dry my soul,
Gone Dry my soul, causes Im all alone
Dry my soul, Dry my soul, Dry my soul,
Gone Dry my soul, cause I'm all alone
My baby, My baby,
Can see Im blind, Youre make me
My baby, You paint me blue
My baby, My baby,
Can see Im blind, Youre make me
My baby, You paint me blue

Gone Dry my soul, cause I'm all alone---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
