Merrily we fall
Out of line, out of line
Id fall anywhere with you
Im by your side

Swinging in the rain
Humming melodies
We're not going anywhere until we freeze

Im not afraid, anymore
Im not afraid

Forever is a long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side

Carefully we'll place our destiny
You came and you took this heart, and set it free
Every word you write or sing is so warm to me, so warm to me
Im torn, Im torn to be right where you are

Im not afraid, anymore
Im not afraid

Forever is a long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side
Tell me everyday I get to wake up to that smile
I wouldn't mind it at all
I wouldn't mind it at all

You so know me
Pinch me gently
I can hardly breathe

Forever is a long, long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side
Tell me everyday I get to wake up to that smile
I wouldn't mind it at all
I wouldn't mind it at all ---
