You got me caught in all this mess.
I guess we can blame it on the rain.
My pain is knowing I can't have you.
(I can't have you)

Tell me does she look at you the way I do?
Try and understand the words you say,
and the way you move?
Does she Get the Same big rush,
When you go in for a hug and your cheeks brush?
Tell me am I crazy, am I crazy?

I catch my breath,
The one you took the moment you entered the room.
My heart it breaks at the thought of her holding you.


Does she look at you the way I do?
Try and understand the words you say,
and the way you move?
Does she Get the Same big rush,
When you go in for a hug and your cheeks brush?
Tell me am I crazy,
Or is this more then a crush?

Maybe im alone in this,
But I find peace in solitude knowing,
f I had but just one kiss this whole room would be glowing.
We'd be glowing.
We'd be glowing.

Does she look at you the way I do?
Try and understand the words you say,
and the way you move?
Does she Get the Same big rush,
When you go in for a hug and your cheeks brush?
Tell me am I crazy, or is this more then a crush?

Tell me does she look at you the way I do?
Try and understand the words you say,
and the way you move?
Does she Get the Same big rush,
When you go in for a hug and your cheeks brush?
Tell me am I crazy, or is this more then a crush?---Lyrics submitted by janedoe.
