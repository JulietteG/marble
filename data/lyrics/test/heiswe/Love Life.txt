La-la-la-la-la La-la-la love life, what's that?
La-la-la-la-la La-la-la love life, what's that?

Hush now,
Quite down
Can you hear my heart racing
Falling to my knees 'cause I've been chasing
A lie
Love life
I don't know what I was thinking
Dipped my toes and now I'm sinking

I guess  it hurts a bit
but im over it now

Heartachs and mistakes
How many hits can a good girl take
I'm tired of hurting
Slowly learning
I rate you're to late
Look at the  mess that you've created
First date to
Slight hate
Love life
What's that?

La-la-la-la-la La-la-la love life, what's that?
La-la-la-la-la La-la-la love life, what's that?

I tried
Yes I tried
But it takes two to make it
I'm obessed and you cant fake it
Denied
Deep inside
I wanna break your heart too
Lead you on and up to drop you

I guess  it hurts a bit
But im over it now
Heartachs and mistakes
How many hits can a good girl take
I'm tired of hurting
Slowly learning
I rate you're to late
Look at the  mess that you've created
First date to
Slight hate
Love life
What's that?

La-la-la-la-la La-la-la love life, what's that?
La-la-la-la-la La-la-la love life, what's that?

Grey clouds above me
Like when you said you loved me
Winds blowing me away
But part of me will allways stay
Eyes closed
Arms wide
Embracethe storm that I feel inside
No more crying
No more crying

I don't  mind a chop or two
But god I love that sound sound
Thunder of my inner chaos
Slowly calming down down
I look up in the sky
No longer seeing you
Look up in the sky
See the sun coming through

La-la-la-la-la La-la-la love life, what's that?
La-la-la-la-la La-la-la love life, what's that?

I guess it hurts a bit
but I'm over it now
Heartachs and mistakes
How many hits can a good girl take
I'm tired of hurting
Slowly learning
I rate you're to late
Look at the mess that you've created
First date to
Slight hate
Love life
What's that?
