I've lived the life of sweet sensation
When its done you're going to fight
Think of all the variations

That piece of ass wont bring you piece of mind

You try to make it last
With the aid of drugs and wine
But you cant stay in bed forever

That piece of ass wont bring you piece of mind

And nothing seems the matter
Cuz nothing seems to laugh
And theres only one thing sadder
That piece of mind wont bring you piece of ass---Lyrics submitted by Nick Burdick.
