You are our life
When death is all around
You are our peace
When all else seems to fail
You are our strength
When our weakness overcomes
You are, yes you are...

When our world is shaken
When our hope is broken
Still you are God of all

You amaze us
You alone are worthy
Of our praises
You deserve our worship
We adore you
Your glory and you majesty
Renew us... Consume us...

Your word brings light
When darkness falls around
Your word speaks truth
When we're lost and wandering
You are our God
Above you there's no one else
You are, yes you are...

All the glory and honor belongs to you
All the glory and honor belongs to you
All the glory and honor belongs to you
Our Lord---
