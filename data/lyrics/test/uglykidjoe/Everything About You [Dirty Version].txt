Are you the guys on the beach that hate everything? ughhh
Is this some sort of hip music that I dont understand?

I, hate the rain and sunny weather, and
I, hate the beach and moutains too, boo hoo
and I, dont like a thing about your city, no no
and I, I, I, hate the countryside too.

And I hate everything about you,
Everything about you

And I, dont like a thing about your mother
and I, I hate your daddy's guts too, boo hoo
and I, dont like a thing about your sister, no no
cuz I, I, I, think sex is overrated too

And I, get sick when im around
I, cant stand to be around
I, hate everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you

Some say I got a bad attitude,
but that dont change the way i feel about you,
and if you think you just might bring me down,
LOOK AGAIN CUZ I WEARING NO FROWN, GET DOWN!

-solo-

Well i dont really care about your sister,
I fucked the little bitch, ive already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady,
I put her on the bed and she didnt even say maybe
I know you know everyone knows
The way it comes, the way its gonna go
and you think its sad and thats to bad
Cuz im having a ball hating every little thing about you HAHA

Everything about you
Everything about I, get sick when im around
I, cant stand to be around
I, hate everything aboooooouuuuutttt...... You... HAHAHAHA---Lyrics submitted by Kristopher.
