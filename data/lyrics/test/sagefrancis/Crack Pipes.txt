I'd give a twenty one gun shot salute
With the toy rifle you bought me but it won't shoot
And all is well because there's been one too many shots
The sterile robots want to talk to me about detox
Stop the presses
There's been an update delivered via 1:30 AM phone call
When an only half informative source talks discreetly

Meet me at the family room
At the side of the intensive care unit
Immediately I carry a tune
The sirens so loud can't hear my music
Keep free of negative thoughts
Everything will be fine we assume
That it would go back to the way things were
That it would all go back to normal soon

Saw the moon in a way that I never seen it before
When I looked up that night into the sky
Wondering why
Looking for answers guess I ain't asked right
I'm guessin' most of y'all out there know exactly what that's like
What that's like
Now tell me what's that like?

It's like a whirlwind of emotions that occurs when moms and dads fight
It's like when a girl grins
An emotion of hers holds your arm and grabs tight
Hurl him into the ocean
One of them cold sweat heat flash types
When extreme fluctuations and temperature changes have been known to crack pipes
Crack pipes
Crack pipes

Meet me half way and I'll go the extra length just to help your strength
Meet me at the AA meeting
Needing to take more than twelve steps
Bring me to your hiding place
So I can face your vice grip
I'll chisel every single monkey off your back with this ice pick
Come meet up with me on the side lines
When the game is over just to say hello
Then afterwards backstage just to let me know you enjoyed the show
And go to grandma's house for Sunday dinner
Sit at the head of the table
Take away the fatal flaw you made the day before
I seen you bleed
Meet me on Christmas Eve
We can fight or make up before you leave
Make visits with the rest of those who rest in pieces of my dreams
Meet me at the fork in the road where lost souls get indecisive
Meet me at the crossroads so I can have someone to walk into the light with---Lyrics submitted by Joshua Crandon.
