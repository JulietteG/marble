Hold your breath as I kiss you softly
Make a wish before you leave this place
Hold me tight as you whisper your last words
Make me smile before I start to cry

You're going down with this ship
And nothing can ever be the same again
I wish that I could take you to a place 
Where the lights would shine on you again

Hold my hand and help me let you go
When darkness breaks I will stay awake
I hope you'll wake up to a precious dawn
Goodbye my love - don't you be afraid

You're going down with this ship
And nothing can ever be the same again
I wish that I could take you to a place 
Where the lights would shine on you again

Shine on you again

You're going down with this ship
And nothing can ever be the same again
I wish that I could take you to a place 
Where the lights would shine on you again---Lyrics submitted by B.
