I am a believer - believing in you and me
But no one ever told me that I would be yours to keep

You are the winner - the winner of all Ive got
But to be grateful and thank me is something that you forgot

Say no more - I've heard it all before
If you'll set me free there's no place I'd rather be but in your arms


Am I pretending - pretending to be the one
The one who's defending - defending what we've become

Say no more I've heard it all before
If you'll set me free there's no place I'd rather be but in your arms

There is a looser  - a looser in every game
Beautiful stranger - to thank me is not a shame

Say no more I've heard it all before
If you'll set me free there's no place I'd rather be but in your arms---Lyrics submitted by B.
