 Lately I've been trying to tell you
That lately I have lost my way
Really need for you to make your mind up
Here today
Gonna make a promise to be braver
Brave enough to change my mind
Sick of being on my best behavior
All the time

Bringing back tomorrow
I will always follow you
You can call me crazy
Chasing down the sunshine
Ill be reaching for the moon
You can call me crazy

Tell me what it is you're after
Something keeps on haunting me
Do you really need a knight in armor
To feel free
Lately I've being trying to reach for
Something I can hold on to
Never Im meant to build an army, holding
On to you

Bringing back tomorrow
I will always follow you
You can call me crazy
Chasing down the sunshine
Ill be reaching for the moon
You can call me crazy

A kind of clarity
So far from sanity
You are close to me
In strange serenity
You can call me crazy now

h h

You can call me crazy
Bringing back tomorrow
I will always follow you
you can call me crazy

You can call me crazy---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
