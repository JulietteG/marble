Fallen from the palm trees
I've been knocked right out of my dreams
I'd say I've learned to take a punch
And smile anyway

But I find myself in places I don't wanna be
In pictures and in pages I don't wanna see

Please wake me up in time
Before I lose my mind
I'm too far from home and all I know
Is - it's too late to rewind
This crime

Violated by someone 
I don't even know
This fate is weighted
I'm so sedated, homeless in my own home 

But I find myself in places I don't wanna be
In pictures and in pages I don't wanna see

Please wake me up in time
Before I lose my mind
I'm too far from home and all I know
Is it's too late to rewind
This crime

The street lights in LA - Cover girls  Celebrities - Moving cars - Crashing stars
But someone took my home from me

Please wake me up in time
I think Ive already lost my mind
Im too far from home and all I know
Is that it's too late to rewind 

This crime---Lyrics submitted by B.
