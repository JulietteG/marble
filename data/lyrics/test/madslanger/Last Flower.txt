It's in the way she fights her fears - it's in the way she hides her tears from me
Its in her eyes I see the changes - it's in the way she smiles so desperately
She is a wild flower - she is a deep sea - the tide will always bring her back to me
It's in the way she looses her mind - running away leaving everything behind

Baby I know wherever you go I'll always be with you - I'll always be with you

She is the water in my hands - chasing me out of my shadow-lands 
It's in her voice I hear the changes - it's in the way she sings but not for me
She is a broken flower - drifting upon the sea - dancing through the night so flawlessly
This is the way I'm loosing my mind - running her way leaving everything behind

Baby I know wherever you go I'll always be with you - I'll always be with you
Whatever may come - wherever we go I'll always be with you - I'll always be with you

She is the last flower in casual clichs - I'm grasping for her forever and always

Baby I know wherever you go I'll always be with you - I'll always be with you
Whatever may come - wherever we go I'll always be with you - I'll always be with you---Lyrics submitted by B.
