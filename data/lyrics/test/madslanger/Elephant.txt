Mysterious, mysterious
As she is walking towards me
Oblivious, I'm oblivious
To what is happening around me
She's covering her face
And I try to catch her eyes

Mysterious, mysterious
She don't even say a word
Delirious, I'm delirious
I surrender myself to the twilight of her
We're covered in the hay, yea
And I try to read her eyes

And she is so beautiful
And I'm afraid of breaking her
And I feel like
I am an elephant in a porcelain shop
I wanna lay her down in a sea of roses everywhere, and just float away
I wanna carry her all around town
And I'll show her to everybody
But I feel like
I am an elephant in a porcelain shop

I'm serious, serious
Losing myself
I'm curious, curious
Where this might end
How I like to feel, oohhh
Her eyes on me
When I look away

'Cause she is so beautiful
And I'm afraid of breaking her
And I feel like
I am an elephant in a porcelain shop
I wanna lay her down in a sea of roses everywhere, and just float away
I wanna carry her all around town
And I'll show her to everybody
But I feel like
I am an elephant in a porcelain shop

An elephant in a porcelain shop,
Oh, how I wish that I wouldn't break everything around me

She is so beautiful
And I'm afraid of breaking her
And I feel like
I am an elephant in a porcelain shop
I wanna lay her down in a sea of roses everywhere, and just float away
I wanna carry her all around town
And I'll show her to everybody
But I feel like
I am an elephant in a porcelain shop---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
