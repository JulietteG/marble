Hello life - shake my hand and break my heart
Open up my eyes and let me see the beauty of the dark

Hello death - I have to put you on hold
Cause Im not ready for the presence of the cold

It's too late to sleep
Too late to wake up
I'm caught between - daylight and a dream
Now I lay me down in a bed of lies 
Knowing any day I'll be betrayed - by the kiss of my killer

Goodbye hope - I guess we're out of luck
Its time we face the facts and finally give up

Goodbye love I really hate to end so sad
Its funny how I believed in things we never had

It's too late to sleep
Too late to wake up
I'm caught between - daylight and a dream
Now I lay me down in a bed of lies
Knowing any day I'll be betrayed - by the kiss of my killer

It's too late to sleep
Too late to wake up
I'm caught between - daylight and a dream
Now I lay me down in a bed of lies
Knowing any day I'll be betrayed - by the kiss of my killer---Lyrics submitted by B.
