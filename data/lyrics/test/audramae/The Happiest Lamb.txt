I once loved a shepherd
A charming, handsome man
One wave of his hickory staff
And I'd foloow him 'round the land
'Til one day I noticed
I weren't the only one
There were all kinda other little pretty young sheep
Havin' all kinda pretty young fun

Hallelujah, I am the happiest lamb
Hallelujah, I am the happiest lamb

I ran to mother Mary,
My face as white as snow
She said 'Kid you remind me of someone I used to know,
Be grateful for your freedom, remember what I said;
"No shepherd man alive, can grow the wool that gets him paid."

Hallelujah, I am the happiest lamb
Hallelujah, I am the happiest lamb
I left my flock and headed off right to the promise land,
Hallelujah, I am the happiest lamb

It's raining, I'm frozen
But I won't sell my wool to buy no shack.
I know it gets much colder when you let some shepherd sheer it off your back.

No shepherd man alive can grow the wool that gets him paid.

Hallelujah, I am the happiest lamb
Hallelujah, I am the happiest lamb
I left my flock and headed off right to the promise land
Hallelujah, I am the happiest lamb

And if you want to know me,
Just ask around who I am
THey'll tell you who I am...
The happiest lamb.---Lyrics submitted by jsli.
