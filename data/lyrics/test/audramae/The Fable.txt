In the cold of the night,
In the forest so still
He's breathing in time
With a heart that is longing
To run with his own.
But he knows he can't
Run with his own.
Cause he knows that.
He left her alone
For some sense of belonging.

Oooooooooooooo

In the shadows of fate,
Lying perfectly still,
She looks to the moon
As her teardrops are falling.
She tries to let go.
Knowing well that she'll
Never let go.
Holding on to a glimmer of hope
Every night while he's calling.

Oooooo

Silenced by guilt
And the chains of his past,
It's broken his will
'Till he's no longer trying.
How could he know?
She was listening but
How could he know?
From the moment she 
Thought he'd let go
She has never stopped crying...


Oooooo---Lyrics submitted by jsli.
