Such a dry relationship
Stop your pent up emotions, Im at my limit
Shes so closed off, I cant talk to her
I just stop in front of her
Every guy is blinded by
Just one annoying smile
But this girl who still
Stays still like this, say

What do I do? (Smile)
(Hey, baby, what do I do, baby)
Even if shes like that (Gloomy)
(Hey, baby, if I like you, baby girl)
