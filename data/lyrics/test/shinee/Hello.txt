----------
When I act like this I realize Im actually young
[Shes] right in front of me but I dont know what to do
How do did you start love?
People who have loved please tell me
Will there be a day when I hold her hand?
Will there be a day when I kiss her above her closed eyes? 

Hello Hello I acted confidently
Hello Hello I want to talk to you for a moment
Hello Hello I might stutter a little, though
Who knows we might actually be together

Should I confront [her] Should I wait [for her]?
Its harder when everyone else says something different
(You cant believe it right?)
Having high standards,
this isnt a usual thing for me Please believe in me yeah
Will there be a day when I hug her freely
I believe that what we think can come true

Hello Hello I acted confidently
Hello Hello I want to talk to you for a moment
Hello Hello I might stutter a little, though
Who knows we might actually oh yeah

This is not the first time Truthfully Ive loved and parted
But its hard, please believe in me You are different

Hello Hello This time Ill put myself out there
Hello Hello Ooh yeah~ Baby Baby Baby girl
Hello Hello I dont know how youre feeling now
Who knows we might actually

Hello Hello Uh~~yeah
Hello Hello Please give me a chance
Hello Hello I dont know how youre feeling now
Who knows we might actually.

(Hello, the times I spent by your side
Can no more compare to any other happiness
I cant express myself to you
My heart wants all of you, never let you go
If this is love, Ill never let it go
Who knows? The two of us)

This might be destiny
Hello Hello---
