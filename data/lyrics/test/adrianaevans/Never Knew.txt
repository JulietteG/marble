VERSE 1:
After all the crazy things that Ive been through,
Theres one thing that I do know to be true; that
Life is just a mystery, full of clues.
I followed all the signs and there was you
We all walk around in our disguise
Hiding all thats true behind our eyes
I never knew that fate could be so wise
I NEVER KNEW, Id love you!


VERSE 2:
Sometimes, we dream of what we hope to see
Does not resemble what is meant to be.
So, we run around in circles aimlessly,
Avoiding what is our true destiny.
We walk with our heads up in the clouds,
Living our whole lives upside down,
Searching for what weve already found.
I NEVER KNEW, Id love you
I NEVER KNEW, it would be you


TAG
Something bout his man, I cant understand
Something in his soul, made me lose control
Something that he said, went to my head
I NEVER KNEW, Id be loving you

I NEVER KNEW, Id be holding you
Ohhh, Id be loving you
Something bout your soul, makes me lose control
Something in your eyes, makes me wanna fly
Something that you said, made me lose my head
Something in your soul, turned me into gold.---Lyrics submitted by Xavier.
