My name is Dita   I'll be your mistress tonight
I'll be your love toy  Turn off the light 
I'll be so   ---     Your heart's magician
I'll be your witch  I'm a love technician
I'll be your guiding light   In your darkest hour
I'm gonna change your life  I'm like a poison flower 

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body (repeat x3)
All over me... all over me... all over me... all over me

We could use the cage   I've got a lot of rope
I'm not full of rage    I'm full of hope
This is not a crime  And you're not on trial
Bend over baby  I'm gonna make you smile
Light the candles  til they're nice and soft
And when they start to drip  I'm gonna get you off

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body (repeat x3)
All over me... all over me.... all over me... all over me

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to..
I could bring you so much pleasure
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body (repeat x4)
OOOOOOOhhhhhhhhh   AAAAAAAAhhhhhhh
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body (repeatx3)
All over me

Only the one that hurts you can make you feel better
Only the one that inflicts pain can take it away
