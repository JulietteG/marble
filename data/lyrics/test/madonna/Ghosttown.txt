Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everythings bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later

Youre all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But were gonna stay here, were gonna stay here

Ahhhhhh, Ahhhhh
I know youre scared tonight
Ahhhhhh, Ahhhhh
Ill never leave your side

When it all falls, when it all falls down
Ill be your fire when the lights go out
When theres no one, no one else around
Well be two souls in a ghost town

When the world gets cold
Ill be your cover
Lets just hold
Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
Well be two souls in a ghost town

Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everythings gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, were gonna hold on

This world has turned to dust
All weve got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

Ahhhhhh, Ahhhhh
I know youre scared tonight
Ahhhhhh, Ahhhhh
Ill never leave your side

When it all falls, when it all falls down
Ill be your fire when the lights go out
When theres no one, no one else around
Well be two souls in a ghost town

When the world gets cold
Ill be your cover
Lets just hold
Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
Well be two souls in a ghost town

I know were alright
Cause well never be alone
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world
Even with no light
Were gonna shine like gold
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world

When it all falls, when it all falls down
Ill be your fire when the lights go out
When theres no one, no one else around
Well be two souls in a ghost town

When it all falls, when it all falls down
Ill be your fire when the lights go out
When theres no one, no one else around
Well be two souls in a ghost town

When the world gets cold
Ill be your cover
Lets just hold
Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
Well be two souls in a ghost town
When it all falls, when it all falls down
Well be two souls in a ghost town---
