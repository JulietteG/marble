I'm going downtown. 
Gonna get me a jug of brandy,
gonna keep it always handy all the time, time, time.
I'll be good and drunk and boozy all the time, time, time.
Good and drunk and boozy all the time.

If you say so, I'll never work no more.
I'll just stay around your shanty all the time, time, time.
Lay around your shanty all the time.(x2)

Going downtown, gonna get me a sack of flour, 
gonna cook it every hour. 
Keep my skillet good and greasy all the time, time, time. 
Skillet good and greasy all the time.

Going downtown.
Gonna get me a jug of brandy,
gonna give it all to Nancy.
I'll be good and drunk and boozy all the time.
Gonna be good and drunk and boozy all the time.---Lyrics submitted by Jacob Rodgers.
