Met a pretty young stewardess on a Nassau flight.
She showed me to my seat and it was love at first sight.
Now, lately I've been flying to all kinds of places where I never really wanted to go,
But I'll do anything just to spend a little time with the cutest flight attendant I know. Whoa!

Chorus: You set my ever lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy.
           Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flier, Airline Amy.
           I found a little piece of heaven on a 747, 
           And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy.

Every one of our dates is at 30,000 feet.
She always points out the exits to me: she's so sweet.
You know, she gets me my headrolls for free, refills my coffee cup whenever I ask, 
And ya gotta admit, my baby looks really hot when she's wearing that oxygen mask. Whoa, whoa!

Repeat Chorus

Airline Amy, don't you know you really drive me nuts,
Every time you're handing out those honey roasted peanuts.
Airline amy, this is my new mission-
I wanna get you in an upright locked position. Well, well!

Repeat Chorus Twice

New Chorus Second Time:
You set my ever lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy.
You're the only woman I desire, Airline Amy.
I found a little piece of heaven on a 747, 
And no one else can take higher,
No one else can take me higher,
No one else can take me higher than Airline Amy!---Lyrics submitted by Thomas.
