I can't believe what she said 
I can't believe what he did 
Oh, don't they know it's wrong 
Don't they know it's wrong 
Well maybe there's something I missed 
But how could they treat me like this 
It's wearing out my heart 
The way they disregard 

This is love or this is hate... 
We all have a choice to make 

Oh, Father wont You forgive them 
They don't know what they've been doin' (oh no) 
Oh Father, give me grace to forgive them 
Cause I feel like the one losin' 

Well it's only the dead that can live 
But still I wrestle with this 
To lose the pain that's mine 
Seventy times seven times 
Cause Lord it doesn't feel right 
For me to turn a blind eye 
Though I guess it's not that much 
When I think of what You've done. 

This is love or this is hate... 
We gotta a choice to make 

Oh Father won't You forgive them 
They don't know what they've been doin' (oh no) 
Oh Father, give me grace to forgive them 
Cause I feel like the one losin' 

Why do we think that our hate's gonna break a hard heart 
We're rippin arms over wars that don't need to be fought 
Cause pride wont let us lay our weapons on the ground 
We build our bridges up but it's just to burn them down 
We think our pain is own apologies and get them to stop 
Well truth be told it doesn't matter if their sorry or not 
Cause freedom comes when we surrender to the sound 
Of Your mercy and Your grace, Father, send Your angels down 

Oh Father wont you forgive them 
They don't know what they've been doin' 
Oh Father, give me grace to forgive them 
Cause I feel like the one losin' 
I feel like I've been losing

Oh Father wont you forgive them 
They don't know what they've been doin' 
Oh Father, give me grace to forgive them 
Cause I feel like the one losin' 
I feel like I've been losing  

Oh Father, give me grace to forgive them 
Cause I feel like the one losin' ---
