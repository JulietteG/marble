Serpent friend of mine, your venom sweet as wine,
still I dont believe you

Possess my hopes and then, dont know what came of them,
still I just dont leave you

Perhaps the fault is mine, and this the final time
you set yourself upon me

The fall will not be far, can still see what we were
and wont be anymore

When the venom comes Ill close my eyes,
as my body numbs and life unties,
I will feel your pull one last time,
then will I escape you?---
