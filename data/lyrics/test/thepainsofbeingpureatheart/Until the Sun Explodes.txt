Wrap me up or shoot me down,
just keep me close to you
I feel so wrong when the curtains drawn
Are you coming to?

If wed stay clean what could we be?
I guess Ill never know
But say to me youll stay with me
until the sun explodes

Tell me now you know somehow
things will turn out right
If we stay dressed in our funeral best
and sleep with open eyes

But you dont look right in the hospital light
breathing soft and slow
But Ill say to you Ill stay with you
until the sun explodes---
