Dealers and the boot life
Got me hooked on freebasing 
And I can't trust my government 
So I looked into the other dimensions
And now, they got me doing bad things

Poker chips, chains and whips
They got me wearing red lipstick
And I can't trust no man of mine
To watch the door while I do my lines
Yeah, they got me doing bad things

I got my friends inside my pockets
Got my gin tucked in my purse
I keep my heart locked in gold
So I don't ever get hurt
And I gamble till the lights of the casino are gone

Holding hands and making plans
These types of things I can't understand
I put my trust in my cigarettes, and make some calls to do the rest
Yeah, they got me doing bad things

I got my friends inside my pockets
Got my gin tucked in my purse
I keep my heart locked in gold
So I don't ever get hurt
And I gamble till the lights of the casino are gone

You know how pretty
The lights of the city look on you---Lyrics submitted by Marieli.
