I see the light shining on me
I'm coming home for the winter

I see the light shining on me
I'm coming home for the winter

I see the light shining on me
I'm coming home for the winter

I see the light shining on me
I'm coming home for the winter

I see the light shining on me
I'm coming home for the winter

I see the light shining on me
I'm coming home for the winter

I see the light shining on me
I'm coming home for dinner---Lyrics submitted by Marieli.
