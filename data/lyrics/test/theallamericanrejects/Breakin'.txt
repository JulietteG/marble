Hold on tight
Wrap your arms around me til your knuckles are burning white
All your tears
Couldnt match the bitter taste of all these wasted years

You take take
Everything that wasnt even yours
Wait wait
You dont got a hold of me anymore

In a clear view theres a silhouette
And I watch you and I cant forget
Knew we were done when you locked that door
Yeah I figured it now
Breakings what the heart is for

When I see you
In a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret
Keeping me down when I hit that floor
And I figured it out girl
Breakings what the heart is..

For so long
Ive had to bite my tongue but whats the point if the feelings gone
I turn my head
Learned I only see some memory but all I see is red

No, dont dont
Say it didnt happen that way
I wont wont
Believe another word that you say

In a clear view theres a silhouette
And I watch you and I cant forget
Knew we were done when you locked that door
Yeah I figured it now
Breakings what the heart is for

When I see you
In a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret
Keeping me down when I hit that floor
And I figured it out girl
Breakings what the heart is for

Yeah breakings what the heart is for
Yeah breakings what the heart is for

And not a soul sleeps
Another heart skips a beat
Its every note that you wrote and I hope that you choke on the lines
Youre wasting my time, another heart beats tonight

In a clear view theres a silhouette
And I watch you no Ill never forget
Knew we were done when you locked that door
Yeah I figured it now
Breakings what the heart is for

When I see you
In a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret
Keeping me down when I hit that floor
And I figured it out girl
Breakings what the heart is for

Yeah Breakings what your heart is for (X4)---Lyrics submitted by Beth.
