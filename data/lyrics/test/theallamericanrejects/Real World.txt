I woke up on this side, I thought it was a dream
At first we learned to walk then learned to scream
You can't understand, when you're fed from a TV screen
You can't see the things that I can see

But I forget, that you thank God and pray
Some things just never stay
And we all just slip away

This can't be the real world now
I don't believe it, when I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world now
The old are carried in only to poison youth
Am I, the only one who thinks it's tragic
'Cause I know
This can't be the real world now
Oh no oh
Oh no oh

I look for some hope in every face there's a vacant stare
The shadows come but no one seems to care
The darkness floods every light that could promise change
She passed sound asleep when the blood is stain
But blood is pain

Somewhere I know, that I'm not all alone
With this bated breath I hold
My lungs want to explode

This can't be the real world now
I don't believe it, when I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world now
The old are carried in only to poison youth
Am I, the only one who thinks it's tragic
'Cause I know
This can't be the real world now
Oh no oh
Oh no oh
This can't be the real world now
Oh no oh
Oh no oh

Just as soon as we see
Every flaw and every need we'll understand
And for the first time
A child to a man says only pure words that he can
He's too late the man he knows it he said
With all emotions set aside in a whisper say goodbye

This can't be the real world now
I don't believe it, when I can't see the truth
Welcome to the real world now
The old are carried in now just to poison youth
Am I, the only one who thinks it's tragic
'Cause I know
This can't be the real world now
Oh no oh
Oh no oh
This can't be the real world now
Oh no oh
Oh no oh
This can't be the real world
This can't be the real world
This can't be the real world now
Oh no oh
Oh no oh---Lyrics submitted by Kristina.
