Back me down from backing up
Hold your breath now it's stacking up
Etched with marks but I can deal
And your the problem and you can't feel

Try this on straightjacket feeling
So maybe I won't be alone
Take back now, my life you're stealing
Yesterday was hell,

But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I've ever thought you'd be
That face is tearing holes in me again

Trust you is just one defense
With a list of others, you don't make sense
Beg me time and time, again
To take you back now, but you can't win

Take back now my life you're stealing...

Yesterday was hell, but today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be,
That face is tearing holes in me

But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on, by letting go of you

And when that memory slips away,
There'll be a better view from here
And only lonesome you remains
And just the thought of you I fear

Grip falls away...

Yesterday was hell, but today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you'd be,
That face is tearing holes in me

But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through,
I'm holding on by letting go of you---Lyrics submitted by Mark Lindsey.
