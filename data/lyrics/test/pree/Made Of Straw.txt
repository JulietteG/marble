You spoke it plain and speak it still 
how once they moved across the sill 
and left it stripped and fit to crack, 
but now theyve fallen further back 

You count yourself a fragile hem 
to hang until you're taken in 
or sewn into a feathered throw, 
forever sleeping, sheet to chin 

You can swallow all you need to keep around 
They will follow when the sun goes down 
You were hollow when they made their rounds and, oh 
you were hollow when the sun went down 
you were hollow when the sun went down 

Set out to drown the weeks, but now 
theyre bound to drag their feet, face down 
and fast asleep, 
forgotten, how 
they came to meet 

From a curtain made of straw 
and twine that cut the frosted air, 
I know exactly what I saw-- 
I saw what simply wasnt there 

No name for what you want 
You kept it safe, it kept too long, 
tripped a vein and stepped upon 
a worry I had left for gone 

You can swallow all you need to keep around 
They will follow when the sun goes down 
You were hollow when they made their rounds, and oh, 
you were hollow when the sun went down 
you were hollow when the sun went down---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Frazee.
