You should be scared 
And whats a wife thats never there? 
And I am one to share 
what I have come to bear 

Suffer what they will not speak 
and they want naught to do with me 

Quite a scene, a chance for ready eyes 
to carve a name to prize and send 
no breath to sting the air 
The wall will sing the lions share 

Its not hard-- its hard to stop 
A stack of smoke that spills a mouth 
Found you once, I found you out 
A stack of smoke that kills a mouth 

Suffer what they will not speak 
and they want naught to do with me 

Borrowed things are nothing had, and now 
its made him something sad 
to shadow when hes walking slow 
no matter now-- they know, they know 

In the summer, long ago 
we gave the winter quite a blow 
fell asleep, and dont you know, 
we fell asleep and woke to snow---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Frazee.
