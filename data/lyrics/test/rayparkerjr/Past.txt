I was wrong when I hurt you
Did you had to hurt me too
Did you think revenge will make it better

I don't care about the past 
Ijust want our love to last
there's a way to bring us back together

(Chorus)
I must forgive you 
You must forgive me too
If we wanna try to put things back the way they used to be
Cause there's no sense in going over and over the same things as before
so let's not bring the past up anymore

Out of all the good we had
You only keep track of the bad
though you knew I never really loved her

Didn't anyone tell you yet to forgive is to forget
how can you be mad if yuo don't remember
(repeat chorus)

I must forgive you 
You must fogive me too
its the only thing that's left that we haven't tried to do
One thing that I'm sure will work that we haven't tried before
Let's not bring the past up anymore---Lyrics submitted by Christyl Ross Abdala Arcamo.
