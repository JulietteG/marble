Welcome home class
U come a long way

Come on let's go
Free people, come on let's go
Free the people, free the people

Eye woke up in the city in a bit of a rage
Trying to free my mind from this art official cage.
? .from an early age
A place in heaven far off in the future

Come on let's go
Free the people, come on let's go
Art official
Art official cage

Ghettos 2 the left of me, Marz 2 the right
Why does my kingdom come only where's at night
Why should I expect if eye'm not willing 2 fight
A place in heaven somewhere in the future

Art official, art official
Art official cage

Louder than a bomb since the day of my birth
Got me second class when eye got here first
Lovely score but how am eye supposed 2 know what it's worth
Art official age in the future

Free the people, come on let's go
Starting from the top getting higher so
Never going back underwater, no
Brand new boogie without the hero
Sure Minneapolis get this, no
Eye'm going up lady liberty's dress and blow, blow, blow

Art Official, free the people
Art official, art official
Art official cage

Art official cage
We need u 2 tell us what u know
We need u 2 tell us what u know

Art official cage
Art official cage
Art official cage
Art official cage, cage, cage, cage, cage, cage, cage---
