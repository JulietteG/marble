She took off her dress and I took a peek
While thunderstorm played hide 'n' seek
I begged 4 a kiss, she gave me 7
Our lips touched and it feel like heaven 

CHORUS:
Everything I want is what she does 2 me
She don't blush cuz she's so damn free
When she makin' love, it's like surgery
And she say - "Ooh, I love U in me" 

"I love..." 

I promise myself not 2 come until she does
Then she took both hands and a liar I was
No man in this world could ever hope 2 last
When my baby downshifts and starts pumpin' fast 

CHORUS 

"I love U, I love U in me" 

Our bodies sink in a pool of sweat
It's the kinda love that U never forget (Yeah)
With U honey, I'm the richest in the world (So rich)
I don't need money cuz U're my girl 

CHORUS
(Surgery) 

"I love U in me" 

Everything I want is what U do 2 me
(Everything I want is what she does 2 me)
U don't blush cuz U're so damn free
(She don't blush cuz she's so damn free)
So free, yeah!
When U're makin' love, it's like surgery
And U say - "Ooh, I love U in me"
"I love U"
Yeah, yeah---Lyrics submitted by joseph.
