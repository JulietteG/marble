Woo
Yeah, oh
Oh
I gave my love, I gave my life, I gave my body and mind
We were inseparable, I guess I gave you all of my time
And now you plead insanity and you don't even know the score
Why can't you learn to play the game?
Baby, don't you know that you need more? (more, more, more)

You need another lover like you need a hole in yo head (baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed, yeah

We were brothers and sisters
United all for love
Now all of the sudden (all of the sudden)
You try to fight it (try to fight it)
You say you've had enough (say you've had enough)
Even though we had big fun (even though we had big fun)
You want another someone (you want another someone)
Yo happily ever after be (Sure as there's a sun)
Sure as there's a sun, (I'm gonna be the one)
I'm gonna be the one and if (you don't understand)
You don't understand face to face, (face to face)
Baby I'll tell you down on my knee, yeah

You need another lover like you need a hole in yo head (baby, baby)
You know there ain't no other
That can do the duty in your bed
Solo, solo

Oh Lord, oh yeah, yeah ha

You need another lover
You know there ain't no other
You need another lover like you need a hole in yo head
Hole in yo head
Hole in yo head
You need another lover like you need a hole, a hole, a hole, a hole
You need another lover
You know there ain't no other

There's gonna be a riot, if you don't clap your hands,
If you don't make that funky stand, everybody
You know there ain't no other---
