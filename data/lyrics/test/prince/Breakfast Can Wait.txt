Hey baby, where you going?
No please dont rush off so soon
If you leave me like this
What Im gonna do

Chorus:
Finally my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long
The only thing that Ive been hoping for
is before you to go to work babe, we get it on
I aint tryin to make you blush,
But I just wanted to tell ya, I think youre great
I know youre late, but I need another taste,
Breakfast can wait!

Verse 1:
Grits and gravy, cheese eggs and jam
Can nobody cook it like you girl
No maam!
This here early morning, need something else on my plate
I think I want another bite of you
Breakfast can wait!

Breakfast can wait
You really put it on me
You shut it down last night
I thought the police was gonna come (last night)
Loud, yeah, cryin
Yeah, I aint tryin to make you blush
I just think youre great
Aint no need to rush,
Breakfast can wait

Chorus:
Finally my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long
The only thing that Ive been hoping for
is before you to go to work babe, we get it on
I aint tryin to make you blush,
But I just wanted to tell ya, I think youre great
I know youre late, but I need another taste,
Breakfast can wait!

Verse 2:
Hotcakes smothered in honey

Fresh cup of coffee, no, no

Only things that gonna sweeten my tongue
Only thing thats gonna last now
Is another bite of you babe
Breakfast can wait

Chorus:
Finally my eyes are open
I dream about you all night long
The only thing that Ive been hoping for

But I just wanted to tell ya, I think youre great
I know youre late, but I need another taste,
Breakfast can wait!
