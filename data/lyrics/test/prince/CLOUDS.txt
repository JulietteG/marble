You should never underestimate the power of
A kiss on the neck, when she doesnt expect
A kiss on the neck, when she doesnt expect
A kiss on the neck
And every time you catch her singin in the shower
You should go and get a flower
Dont matter what the hour
Just rub it on her back, rub it on her back, rub it on her back

In this brand new age we do everything
Quick, fast, in a hurry
All of our lifes a stage
Everybody stars, reality so blurry
If you scream out loud, loud
Top of your voice be higher than the crowd (no)
Tattoo-less and proud, yeah
Well get to something higher that doesnt require clouds
No, we dont need no clouds, no

You should never underestimate the power of
A kiss on the neck, when she doesnt expect
A kiss on the neck, when she doesnt expect
A kiss on the neck
And every time you catch her singin in the shower
You should go and get a flower
Dont matter what the hour
Just rub it on her back, rub it on her back, rub it on her back
All over me

Im gonna give you something baby
But I wonder does it really even matter if it aint on a stage
If it aint on a stage
I dont really think it matters in this brand new age

When lifes a stage, in this brand new age
How do we engage?
Bullying just for fun
No wonder theres so many guns
Maybe were better off in space

Mr. Nelson, Mr. Nelson, can you hear my voice?
Sir, we know youre a little bit groggy
And youre probably going to find it hard to speak
But dont try to talk or process too much now
We just want to let you know that the medication you were given
Has put you in a suspended animation for quite some time
Well, in fact, about 45 years
But where you are now
Is a place that doesnt require time
That saying, you are completely safe
And we are here to help you

You should never underestimate the power of
A kiss on the neck, when she doesnt expect
A kiss on the neck, when she doesnt expect
A kiss on the neck
Its in my power to love you
Its in my power to love you up
Its in my power to love you

Its in my power to love you up---
