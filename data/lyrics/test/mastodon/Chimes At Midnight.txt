I saw the mountain crumble down
I saw corrosive influence
I will be out shut drying
Nothing that I do ever change

Off with my head, come down the line
I have been lied to, designed
I pray this is right, on my spine
altered minds, they criticize

Arrest what's in your flesh
How can we stop this pollution?
I've been down, you cannot fix
Envy our mothers, let the nights be rich

All my heroes, they're all dead
I remain inside my

The way I handle it meantime I realize
And to the boat I go
The way I am, I've seen a face again
All blind behind me go

Rising inside
I am alive

And the darkness here is grim
But it found us, surrounding
Leave me deep into the cranium
You push your guidance all around me

Feet, I'm grounded, give me your best
I'll take you golden to silence
You take a stand, pushing yourself
For this gold is never ending

The way I handle it meantime I realize
And to the boat I go
The way I am, I've seen a face again
All blind behind me go

Rising inside
I am alive---
