Some stupid chick in the checkout line
Was paying for beer with nickels and dimes,
And some old man had clipped coupons
And argued whenever they wouldn't take one.
All I wanted to was buy some cigarettes
But I couldn't take it anymore so I left.

I hate everyone.
I hate everyone.
I hate everyone.
I hate everyone.

All the people on the street, I hate you all
And the people that I meet, I hate you all
And the people that I know, I hate you all
And the people that I don't, I hate you all.
Oh, I hate you all.

Some fucking asshole just cut me off
And gave me the finger when I fucking honked.
Then he proceeded to put on the brakes
He slammed on the brakes, but I made a mistake
When I climbed out of my van he was waiting,
But he was six three and two hundred pounds of Satan.

I hate everyone.
I hate everyone.
I hate everyone.
I hate everyone.

All the people on the street, I hate you all
And the people that I meet, I hate you all
And the people that I know, I hate you all
And the people that I don't, I hate you all.
Oh, I hate you all.

I bet you think I'm kidding
But I promise you its true
I hate most everybody
But most of all I hate
Oh, I hate you.

All the people on the street, I hate you all
And the people that I meet, I hate you all
And the people that I know, I hate you all
And the people that I don't, I hate you all
And the people in the east, I hate you all
And the people I hate least, I hate you all
And the people in the west, I hate you all
And the people I like best, I hate you all.
Oh, I hate you all.---Lyrics submitted by Z.
