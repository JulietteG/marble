I don't know what it is tonight
Your smile, your eyes, yeah
Even in a candlelight
You shine so bright
And you're so beautiful
More beautiful than you've ever been
I catch my breath
And fall in love again

I can't imagine where I'll be without you with me
I need you every day more than words can say
I want you in the life
And for all the life
This night will never end
You take my hand
And I fall in love again

Nothing short of a miracle
could've brought you here to me
When I'm with you
Heaven's all I see
All I see

Caught up in every touch
I feel the rush of this moment back when we're here
Each time we kiss
I fall in love again
I can't resist
I fall in love again---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
