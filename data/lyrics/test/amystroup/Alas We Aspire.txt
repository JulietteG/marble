Hey here we go
Even we
Even so
Hey here we go
Ever fast
Ever slow

Alas we aspire
Feel the flame
Carry  fire
Alas we as fire
Feel the flame
Take me higher

Where are you now oh oh
Where are you now oh oh

Look through my words
Im mine
Youre yours
Look through my words
Youre mine
Im yours

Where are you now oh oh
Where are you now oh oh

Rain cleared the wood
Shallow light
There you stood
Rain cleared the wood
Turned  my eyes
There you stood---Lyrics submitted by Jeremy.
