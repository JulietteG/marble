You can have all the diamonds, you can have all the gold,
but someday you're still gonna get old.
You've gotta learn to get happy along the way.
Take some chances allow yourself to get lost, you're beautiful baby you're the boss.  
You've gotta learn to get happy along the way.

It's no fault to follow only stones left unturned.
You must play with fire in order to get burned.

Toss your misery out the door
what are you waiting for?
You've gotta learn to get a little happy along the way.

Its all right to change your style, 
its all right to smile.
its all right to get a little happy along the way.

Tough day at the office, and no worse, not at home.
Dont wanna talk about it, just wanna be left alone.
Theres no joy in living when you're giving all and getting none.
Its a new beginning , you thought you lost oh but honey you're the one.

You can have all the diamonds, all the gold.
But someday were still gonna get old.
We've gotta learn to get happy along the way.
Get your hat, get your coat babe.
Leave your worries on the doorstep.
We've gotta get a little happy along the way.---Lyrics submitted by Diana Lynn.
