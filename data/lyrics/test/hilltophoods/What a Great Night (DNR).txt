Verse 1  Suffa
This is for the hopeless, the homeless, the brokest, the dopest,
The smokers, the jokers on opiates and coke its,
Your choice, I wont judge you tonight,
Cos Im paraletic, I aint looking to lose a fight,
So put your hands up if youre not to drunk to stand up,
If you bombing up the toilets put your man up,
And put your can up spray it in the air mate,
Check out my man, fuck its all going pear shaped,
They call me Suff when Im drunk they call me fuck off,
Head under the bar trying to drink the run off,
Im a one of a kind; Ill rhyme till Im cut off,
Or just to fucking blind to get one off,
Dont call me son of a bitch; Im the son of an angel,
When the sun of the morning hits its so painful,
These all nighters are killing me,
But its alright are you feeling me?

Chorus
And its all love, and its alright,
Till were all drunk, then its all fights,
Then its all over, go home, go sleep,
Wake up, get sober, what a great night,
And its all love, and its alright,
Till were all drunk, then its all fights,
Then its all over, go home, go sleep,
Wake up, get sober, what a great night.

Verse 2  Suffa
This is for the gamblers, the ramblers, the grandmas and grandpas,
The fans of the samplers, my godson in pampers,
Champlers lets all amp this out like Peavey,
Like De La said its so easy,
Its so easy, to pack this,
Chain smoking in the back like I had three cigarettes and one match its,
The one who sucks tequila from a cactus,
You couldnt hack this with axes, to all the detractors,
Go listen to Axis if you want proof,
That Obese aint actors, we produce,
The rawest performance from verse to the chorus,
Hung like a walrus, run like a tortoise,
Obese, enormous, flawless on the cordless,
I own this mic like my name was Shure its,
For the poorest or richest, slowest or quickest,
Flow with a sickness, bro you know what this is?

Chorus
And its all love, and its alright,
Till were all drunk, then its all fights,
Then its all over, go home, go sleep,
Wake up, get sober, what a great night,
And its all love, and its alright,
Till were all drunk, then its all fights,
Then its all over, go home, go sleep,
Wake up, get sober, what a great night,
Gin and tonic, you rock the house,
Tequila shots, you rock the house,
Chivas Regal, you rock the house,
jagerbombs, you rock the house,
(The Hilltop Rock the house)
(The Hilltop Rock the house)
(The Hilltop Rock the house)Check It Out
(The Hilltop Rock the house)It's Like this,it's like this,it's like this,
And its all love, and its alright,
Till were all drunk, then its all fights,
Then its all over, go home, go sleep,
Wake up, get sober, what a great night,
And its all love, and its alright,
Till were all drunk, then its all fights,
Then its all over, go home, go sleep,
Wake up, get sober, what a great night.---Lyrics submitted by Bram.
