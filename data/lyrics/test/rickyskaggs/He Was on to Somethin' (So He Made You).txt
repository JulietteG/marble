The moon ain't yellow and the moon ain't blue,
it ain't made of cheese and it don't have a thing to do
with me and you.
Your mind ain't straight and your heart can't break,
tears don't roll and lips don't taste like
cherry wine sugar and honey dew.
But honey when you tell me that you love me true
I believe in you and, Ooooh
your love makes everything come true.

Cause love makes a blue moon turn gold,
makes a heart break and makes a tear roll.
When God made love I betcha he knew,
that he was on to somethin' so he made you.

Midnight really ain't the middle of the night,
it's either to the left or a little bit to the right
it's ever so slight.
The sun don't move and it can't go down,
never comes up and it don't roll around
in heaven all day the sun don't roll around.
But honey when you tell me that you love me true,
I believe in you and, Ooooh
your love makes everything come true.

Love makes the sun come up and go down,
cause love makes the world go around.
When God made love I betcha he knew,
that he was on to somethin' so he made you.

Love makes the world go around,
it makes the sun come up and go down.
When God made love I betcha he knew,
that he was on to somethin' so he made you.
Ya he was on to somethin' so he made you.---Lyrics submitted by Raymond.
