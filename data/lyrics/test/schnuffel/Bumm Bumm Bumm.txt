If you're lonely I'll stand in front of your door
If you want me to I'll stay here forever
If it rains, then I'll be your sunshine

If you're happy I'll laugh along with you
If you run away, I'll follow you step by step
I promise you, I'll never leave you alone again

Boom, boom, boom, my heart's jumping around
Thump, thump, thump, yes you still love me
Hum, hum, hum, it will never mute
Boom, boom, boom

Boom, boom, boom, my heart is jumping around
Thump, thump, thump, yes you still love me
Hum, hum, hum, it will never mute
Boom, boom, boom

If I cry you kiss the tears away,
you search us both a save hiding place
If it rains, then you'll be my sunshine

If you sing cause you're so happy I'll sing along,
It is our "Thump-thump-Hit",
I promise you, I'll never leave you alone again

Boom, boom, boom, my heart's jumping around
Thump, thump, thump, yes you still love me
Hum, hum, hum, it will never mute
Boom, boom, boom

Boom, boom, boom, my heart's jumping around
Thump, thump, thump, yes you still love me
Hum, hum, hum, it will never mute
Boom, boom, boom

Don't cry, after the rain comes the sunshine
I promise you I'll never leave you alone again

Boom, boom, boom, my heart's jumping around
Thump, thump, thump, yes you still love me
Hum, hum, hum it will never mute
Boom, boom, boom

Boom, boom, boom, my heart's jumping around
Thump, thump, thump, yes you still love me
Hum, hum, hum, it will never mute
Boom, boom, boom

Boom, boom, boom, my heart's jumping around
Thump, thump, thump, yes you still love me
Hum, hum, hum, it will never mute
Boom, boom, boom...---Lyrics submitted by Lucas watts.
