You are my sweetest love,
That love i lways wanna hug,
Because i really love you
The world just has to know.

-CHORUS-
I'll do anything for you,
There's nothing i would'nt do
Snuggle,Cuddle and then Hug, me,
With you, I always want to be.

La la la la la la la la,La la la la la la la la, La la la la la la la la.

My love is deep and true,
I'd be lost if not with you,
So lonley it would have been,
If not for you and me.

-CHORUS-
I'll do anything for you,
There's nothing i would'nt do,
Snuggle cuddle and then Hug me, 
With you i always wanna be.


la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la,  la la la la la la la la

Our feelings are so strong
And our hearts will beat as one
a never ending story
Is what i have with you.

-CHORUS-
I'll do anything for you,
Theres nothing i wouldnt do,
Snuggle,cuddle and then Hug me,
With you i always want to be.

La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la.

You are my sweetest Love
That love i always wanna hug,
Because i really love you,
The world just has to know.

-last chorus-
I'll do anything for you,
Theres nothing i wouldnt do,
Snuggle, Huggle and then hug me,
With you i always wanna be.---Lyrics submitted by Lyria.
