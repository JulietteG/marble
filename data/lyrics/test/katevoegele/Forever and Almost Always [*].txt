So the story goes on down
The less traveled road
It's a variation on
The one I was told
And although it's not the same
It's awful close, yeah

In an ordinary fairy tale land
There's a promise of a perfect
happy end
And I imagine having just short of that
its better than nothing

So you'll be mine forever and almost always
And I'll be fine
Just love me when you can
Yeah
And I'll wait patiently
I'll wake up everyday 
just hoping that you still care

In the corner of my mind I know too well 
oh that surely even I deserve the best
But instead of leaving
I just put the issue to bed
And outta my head

Oh and just when I believe
You've changed for good
well you go and prove me wrong
Just like I knew you would
When I run out of second chances
you give me that look 
and you're off the hook

Because you're mine
Forever and almost always
And I'll be fine
Just love me when you can
Yeahh
And I'll wait patiently
I'll wake up everyday
Just hoping that you still care

Oohhh
What am I still doing here?
Oohh
It's all becoming so clear
Yeahhh

You'll be mine
Forever and almost always
It aint right to just love me when you can
Oohh
I won't wait patiently 
Or wake up everyday
Just hoping that you'll still care

Forever and almost always
No it aint right
To just love me when you can,
Baby
Aint gonna wait patiently
Or wake up everyday
Just hoping that you still care

Oohhh---Lyrics submitted by Brianna.
