Gone away, are the golden days
They're just a page, in my diary
So here I am, utopian citizen
I'm still convinced, there's no such thing as idealism
Memories they're following me like a shadow now, and I'm dreaming
'Cause I've already suffered the fear of disbelief, Hey...

But I've seen your act and I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were, yeah
It ain't hard to see who you are underneath
I'm still in love with who I wish you were
I wish you were here, yeah

I was true, as the sky is blue
But I couldn't soon, say the same for you, no no
So now I find, denial in my eyes
Mesmerized by the picture that's in my mind, now, oh oh
So tell me when I'll finally see your shallow heart, for what it is, yeah
'Cause I don't want to keep on believing in illusions, no no no

'Cause I've seen your act and I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were, yeah
It ain't hard to see who you are underneath
I'm still in love with who I wish you were
I wish you were here

Sometimes I can't explain
And I'm so sorry that I can't
I'll try to concentrate, 
on your true identity 
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause I've seen your act and I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were, yeah
It ain't hard to see who you are underneath
I'm still in love with who I wish you were
I've seen your act and I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were, yeah
It' ain't hard to see who you are underneath
I'm still in love with who I wish you were, now
I wish you were here
ohh, ohh..... I wish you were here, now
ohh.....
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here.---Lyrics submitted by shelly.
