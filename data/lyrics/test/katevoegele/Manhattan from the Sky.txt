baby, what are you doing today?
what are you doing later?
I dont know my way through a maze of gray skyscrapers
but I'm willin' to learn
If you want me too, I'll stay just where I am
But I promise just to follow when I land
And you can take my word for that

you are my MANHATTAN FROM THE SKY
you look so neat and tidy when I'm way up high
but I know your streets are lined with a fine mess inside
And I wanna come down and walk around your mind

Daisies once upon an old daydream, thats what you gave me
Out on the corner of Broadway and 48th street, on a rainy afternoon
I couln't start discovering your world
I would make a damn good city girl
Thing's would start to bloom, I'm sure

you are my MANHATTAN FROM THE SKY
you look so neat and tidy when I'm way up high
but I know your streets are lined with a fine mess inside
I wanna come down and walk around your mind

I know you want me to see dont lie to me
Why you gotta' be so shy to me?
I ain't buyin' the false anxiety let your fortress fall
What is it gonna' take to get you there?
If it was money, you'd me a millionaire
Or all along in the leather swivel chair counting stacks of Gold

you are my MANHATTAN FROM THE SKY
you look so neat and tidy when I'm way up high
but I know your streets are lined with a fine mess inside
I wanna come down and walk around your

you are my MANHATTAN FROM THE SKY
you look so neat and tidy when I'm way up high
but I know your streets are lined with a fine mess inside
I wanna come down and walk around your mind
