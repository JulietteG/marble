How many times have you used that line?
Did you replace the last two dozen names with mine?

Is 'I love you baby' second nature by now?
Cause it sounds awful rehearsed
When the words leave your mouth

I don't know why but it seems
That I'm not the first to have heard this speech
Is this a routine you just repeat?
Cause I don't mean to presume
That you don't love me like you say you do
But, you're gonna have to prove that you're true
And you're not just talkin' smooth

Your performance deserves an academy award
And it's a double edged sword, cause I feel adored

But just between us I'd rather see you slip up
Don't you know that it's those
Less than perfect words I can't get enough of

Maybe I'm outta my head
But I'm tellin' you baby that I've been mislead
So if the record's off well could you get it set?
I don't mean to presume
That you don't love me like you say you do
But you're gonna have to prove that you're true
And you're not just talkin' smooth

Well you've proven your charm is a crime
Oh, and oh why don't you see
The harm is relying on this disguise
You're losing me with every little wink of the eye

The end of my rope is slipping out of my hold
So if you're clever you'd better do some damage control

I don't know why but it seems
You've made a game of making a fool outta me
And I did not sign up to be
Your tongue-in-cheek, hey oh, yeah

I don't mean to presume
That you don't love me like you say you do
But you're gonna have to prove that you're true
And you're not just talkin' smooth
Oh, can you prove you're not just talkin' smooth?---Lyrics submitted by Bri.
