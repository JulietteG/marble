I've never known you
I'm no stranger to this feeling I,
I know it's over but the hurt's not.
What do you call it
When broken hearts are not done healing 
You throw down your cigarette butt,
it's still hot.

Well I've learned a lot,
and here's what I've got

(CHORUS)
Didn't I think you would always love me
didn't I want you to take care of me baby,
well that ain't happening.
no oh no now
Couldn't our love just rise above this,
you gotta believe I've suffered enough to be free.
so im officially leaving 
just a kiss on the cheek and I'm gone,
I'll be on the 7 o'clock
uh oh uh oh
the 7 o'clock to Chicago
oh uh oh uh oh oh yeah

It's never easy 
breaking this old addiction no
i've got the reasons but no rational
I wanna hate you,
cuz you don't give me no conviction 
your betrayal oughta make this break down
no trouble at all so 
so let the rubble fall
cuz i'm running off the road 
now now now

(CHORUS)

I'll be on the 7 o'clock to Chicago
I ain't got no second thoughts 
I'm on my way to the top
I'm on my way.....

(CHORUS)

The 7 o'clock to Chicago
oh oh oh uh oh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Lauren.
