The music
That you are hearing
Is something stolen
Rhythm and all

I heard it
And then I taped it
And added singing
But no guitars

It was long ago I can't remember
I have trouble calling at the past
Now I know - oh yes - it was Vienna
At some all-night Greco-Roman bash

When Sigmund Freud's invited to a party
That's a party that will last and last
When Sigmund Freud's invited to a party
You should see the mess the morning aft.

(Tap Dancing solo)

That was Sigmund after two martinis
Dancing like some hoochie-coochie queen
When Sigmund Freud's invited to a party
You should see the mess the morning aft

Sigmund
Shows invitation
Enters with patient
Blond, really nice

Egos
So many egos
Perfect for Sigmund
Checking them out

Now he's had a couple more martinis
What he's doing now I can't reveal.

When Sigmund Freud's invited to a party
That's a party that will last and last
When Sigmund Freud's invited to a party
You should see the mess the morning aft.---Lyrics submitted by RR.
