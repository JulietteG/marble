First impressions can matter
When disrespecting your partner
But I hoped that theyd come good
Although they never would

So spare a thought for us lovers
And the things you left behind
Like kind words from the broken hearted
Sweet words from a tortured mind
Yes spare a thought for us lovers
And the things you left behind
Like kind words from the broken hearted
Sweet words from a tortured mind

First impressions they matter
When disrespecting your partner
But as you know I hoped that theyd come good
Although they never would

So spare a thought for us lovers
And the things you left behind
Like kind words from the broken hearted
Sweet words from a tortured mind
Yes spare a thought for us lovers
And the things you left behind
Like kind words from the broken hearted
Sweet words from a tortured mind

So spare a thought for us lovers
And the things you left behind
Like kind words from the broken hearted
Sweet words from a tortured mind
Yes spare a thought for us lovers
And the things you left behind
Like kind words from the broken hearted
Sweet words from a tortured mind
Heyyyyyyyyy---Lyrics submitted by Jonathan.
