Red sun in a lazy sky
Sittin' on the end of my hood
Turning in a Friday night
Yeah, this is gonna be good

Here you come wearin' that dress
Just like I hoped you would
A good, long I missed you kiss
Mmm, this is gonna be good

Your blue eyes, green in my pocket
Night is young, were gonna rock it

Oh, it's all starting to come together
Stars are lining up like they should
Yeah, like I pictured, but even better
It's gonna be you and me
And it's gonna be, yeah, it's gonna be good

I know a little hole in the wall
You wanna go, yeah, I thought you would
Well tear it up like a wrecking ball
Mmm, this is gonna be so good

My luck, it's your favorite band
And you dance like I knew you could
Well break it down to a nice, slow jam
Yeah, this is gonna be good

We've got a groove, we better lock it
Night is young, were gonna rock it

Oh, it's all starting to come together
Stars are lining up like they should
Yeah, like I pictured, but even better
It's gonna be you and me
And it's gonna be, yeah, it's gonna be good

Oh, the night is young, we're gonna rock it
We're on a roll, we can't stop it

Oh, it's all starting to come together
Stars are lining up like they should
Yeah, like I pictured, but even better
It's gonna be you and me
And it's gonna be, yeah, it's gonna be good

Oh, it's gonna be so good
Just like I pictured, but even better
It's gonna be you and me
And it's gonna be, yeah, it's gonna be good---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
