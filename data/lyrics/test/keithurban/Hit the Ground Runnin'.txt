Well if you ever said goodbye
I wouldn't waste none of my time cryin'
I wouldn't sit home alone wondering where I went wrong
I'd be rocking on outta here
Baby faster than a rolling tear
Ain't no grass gonna grow under me when you're gone no
I won't stay down for long

Chorus:
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running
I know exactly what I'd do honey
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running 
I'd hit the ground running after you yeah

Only stoppin' long enough
For a couple things I gotta pick up
Like some pretty red flowers and a store bought card
That say what I really feel
That I need you and I always will
And the three little words that used to come hard
Then I'd jump in back in my car then I'd

Chorus

There ain't no doubt
I ain't that proud
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do
I'd hit the ground
Hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running after you, yes I would
So if you gotta go baby I won't stop you
And I won't sit around and miss you, no no no
'Cause if you leave I'm a coming with you
I'm coming with you baby

Chorus

There ain't no doubt
I ain't that proud
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running after you---Lyrics submitted by Treana.
