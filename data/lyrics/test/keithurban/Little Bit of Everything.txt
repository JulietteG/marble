I wish I could take a cab down to the creek
And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow it'd be good for me
I want a cool chick that'll cook for me
But'll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want and she'll do it with me

I don't need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don't need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na

Now I don't need a garage full of cars
But I'll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And I'll smoke 'em nice and slow
Like they were good for me
Don't need a ranch or a big piece of land
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ole room
Still feels lonely when it's just you
Yes it does

I don't need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don't need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na

A little bit of everything
Under the sun
So, when I kick back basking in it
I'll be OK with what I've done
Still having fun

Cause I don't need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I don't need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Yeah yea yea
Whoa, whoa, oh yeah---
