I thought I was doin' alright
Bein' alone
I swore I'd never let somebody get close again
I was never gonna let my guard down
Not for anyone
But there's a light in your eyes and it's got me movin' in, oh
And tonight these walls are all coming down

Chorus:
And my heart is open
I'm letting you in
Cause you give me a reason
And the faith I've been needing to start again
And your love is healing
I'm finally breathing
And I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment 
My heart is open

These days it seems like everybody's just walking away
Like there's no forever and love is just a game
But don't you know
That you can believe me when I say
That I'm your man

Chorus

I can't wait anymore, no no
'Cause I got nothing left to prove
And I got so much love for you
That's why I'm tearing out the walls and baby
I'm kicking down the doors
And your love is healing
Baby I'm finally breathing
And I can hear you calling I'm ready to fall in love again
And my heart is open
Yeah my heart is open
My heart is open---Lyrics submitted by Treana.
