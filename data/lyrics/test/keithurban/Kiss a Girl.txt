T...to kiss and tell
Its just not my style.
But the night is young,
And its been a while.
And she broke my heart,
Broke it right in two.
And its fixing time,
But Im feeling like Im finally ready to
Find, find somebody new.
I wanna kiss a girl,
I wanna hold her tight,
And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight.
Dont wanna go too far
Just to take it slow,
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big ol world.
I wanna kiss a girl.
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Its that moment when
You start closing in.
First youre holding back,
Then surrendering.
It can start a fire,
Light up the sky.
Such a simple thing,
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to
Say goodbye
To all these blues?
I wanna kiss a girl,
I wanna hold her tight,
And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight.
Dont wanna go too far
Just to take it slow,
But I shouldnt be lonely in this big ol world.
I wanna kiss a girl.
Cause maybe tonight
It could turn into the rest of our lives.
(Oh yeah)
Are you ready?
(Are you ready?)
Are you ready
(Are you ready)
To cross that line?
Put your lips on mine?
Put your lips on mine, baby.
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to
Say goodbye
To all these blues?
I wanna kiss a girl,
I wanna hold her tight,
And maybe make a little magic, baby.
Dont wanna go too far
Just to take it slow,
No one should be lonely-
I shouldnt be lonely.
I wanna kiss a girl,
I wanna hold her tight,
And maybe make a little magic in the moonlight.
Dont wanna go too far
Just to take it slow,
I shouldnt be lonely in this big ol world.
I wanna kiss a girl.
Na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na-na-na 
I said I wanna kiss a girl.
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Whoa-ho whoa-ho
I wanna kiss a girl.
I wanna hold her tight,
I wanna make a little magic
Out under the moonlight.
Ooh I wanna kiss a girl.---Lyrics submitted by Carey.
