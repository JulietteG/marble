(Verse)
I couldnt bring myself to take you home
Ive got you out here all alone
And even this old drunken mind
Still right here tonight

(Verse)
Yellow fireflies in the field
Think I know the way I feel
At the corner of my eye
Did you see that?

(Chorus)
Every star up in the sky
Has got your name on it tonight
And they dont stand a chance like I know I do
And girl you cant tell me that you cant see
The kind of spell you put on me
You gotta know just what you do
Even the stars fall for you
Even the stars fall for you

(Verse)
So make a wish and make it fast
I just want this thing to last
Cause heaven knows its falling hard
And Im not the only one

(Chorus)
Every star up in the sky
Has got your name on it tonight
And they dont stand a chance like I know I do
And girl you cant tell me that you cant see
The kind of spell you put on me
You gotta know just what you do
Even the stars fall for you

(Bridge)
I never counted on your touch
Making me want you so much
I never dreamed of your sweet lips
Could make me feel like this
Nothing like this

(Chorus)
Every star up in the sky
Has got your name on it tonight
And they dont stand a chance like I know I do
And girl you cant tell me that you cant see
The kind of spell you put on me
Cause you gotta know just what you do
Even the stars fall for you
Even the stars fall for you
Even the stars fall for you---
