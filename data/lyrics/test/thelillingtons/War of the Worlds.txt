War of the worlds
It's all coming down
Laser beams and bombs 
Are the only sound
Flying silver discs
Coming from the sky
They wanna kill us all
The wanna see us die
Man or machine 
They came from outer space
Prgrammed to search
And destroy the master race

(Chorus x4)
War of the worlds 
We're all gonna die---Lyrics submitted by Tony Bown.
