oh by the way
there's still plenty of time to waste in the day
doesn't matter what your friends don't say
i'll stay strange as i wanna be

down by the bay
wandering aimlessly today
so you say that it's typical to act this way
i say you're not the same as me

staring at the people in the street
shameless imitations of the ones that used to be
trying to set us free

you think you're dangerous
you step to us without a cause
we'll make you wish you never left your bed at all

laughing in your face until you cry 
look around you all your friends have left without goodbyes
watch them run and hide

let's make believe you never left your bed at all

oh by the way
wasted all that time away
now we're great
never thought that it would end this way
i pray you're not ashamed of me---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
