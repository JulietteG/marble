Would you believe I'm crawling up the walls again?
Isn't it me, or something in the water?

Oh, but I love you
more than I should
you said you loved me too
but it doesn't do me any good 
when you don't know love

quarter to three
I'm crawling up the walls again
somebody screamed "there's something in the water!"

Oh but i love to 
stay up all night
you used to love that too
but you didn't make it out tonight
i guess you don't know love

Darlin' i love you 
more than i should
more than i thought i would
but i guess it wasn't any good
'cause you don't know know---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
