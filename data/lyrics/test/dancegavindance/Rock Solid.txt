The first thing I say in the morning is:
"Fuck that shit."
People are offended and tired,
so fuck that shit.
I walk myself to my church service
and ask for this.
Balance my brain chemicals,
so I can give a shit.
(Shit)

Stay back and don't make advances.
I'll keep my side of the trade.
(Here is a blatant remark)
And I fought for bitter contacts were in order.
Contacts were in order.
(I'll never get arrested)
Bitter contacts were in order.
This is all for the opposition.
For the opposition.

Make it right,
put your soul on ice,
give a chance to make this better.
Make it right,
put your soul on ice,
lets wait to pull that lever.
Make this right,
put your soul on ice,
I need to make this better.
Make this right,
put your soul on ice,
but I still make this wrong.

I get hyphy on such a decadent mixture,
man, we're back again.
But I'm only here for just one more show,
feel the back of my hand.
feeling alone on such a decadent mixture,
wanna hit ya get your picture and just take you home,
record banter, we make post parole.

And then, and then, and then I took the keys right out of the ignition
and I ran, broke out down running down the street,
lookin' for where the hell...
Where the hell can I hide?
People, people tryin' to ask me questions man.
I don't know the fuckin' answers,
uh, I just got this rock.
I just got this rock, rock solid.

Raise your hand,
if the system has missed you man.
Your money ain't gone
as far as it used to
Raise your hand,
if the system has missed you man.
Raise your hand.
Raise your fucking hand.

Oh, hey Jon.
Oh, yeah.
How's it going man?
Oh, I'm alright wh-whatever.
Did you hear about that party?
No, no where's that?
Dude --I can't.
is it 26 and Q or what?
Dude, it's L.
What?
Yeah.
Dude I've been driving around for like fuckin' half an hour.
I thought you were picking me up right now.
Well, I was going to but I had to stop at the store
and get some fucking shit.
You had to stop at the store?
Well, what are we going to fucking drink?
Do you still have the money that I gave you earliar?
Well, not really because I had to buy beer.
That's fucked up man every time I pick you up
and I pick my money on you.
Well --whatever, I don't give a shit.
I'm still going are you going to come?
I'll pick you up still.
But the party is going to be over by the time I get over there.
Well, it doesn't really matter right now
because you are Rock Solid.
Rock Solid?
Rock Solid.
We're both Rock Solid.
That's right.

Raise your hand,
if the system has missed you.
Your money ain't gone
as far is it used to.
Raise your hand,
if the system has missed you.
Your money ain't gone
as far is it used to.
Raise your hand,
if the system has missed you.
Your money ain't gone
as far is it used to.
Raise your hand,
if the system has missed you.
Your money ain't gone
as far is it used to.

And you... persist.
Oh well.
Ahhhhhh!
I'll learn and just have to live with it.---Lyrics submitted by Nikki.
