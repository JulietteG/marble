But now you know that I am cold
(Take me out now, I've dropped the mast down)
And now I am found
(Take me out now, I've dropped the mast down)

Duck down, then hide, behind the file cabinet
Duck down, then hide, behind the file cabinet, down
Without ever letting go I knew you'd gone
Duck down, then hide, behind the file cabinet
Duck down, then hide, behind the file cabinet, down
Without ever letting go I knew you'd gone astray
Stranded here in this cold atmosphere.
Waiting for the lifeless words to come from your mouth
Enduring every sound

This is not why the cast is hollow
Sending the rats to follow
Under the weight of all these eyes
Fry

But now you know that I am cold
(Take me out now, I've dropped the mast down)
And now I am found
(Take me out now, I've dropped the mast down)

I lay without understanding
I don't know why I feel this way
Oh lay down girl take my world
I know why I can't see your face
I've placed every mole there is to place on your wasted body
Oh, lay down girl and take my world
I know why I can't see your face

As the window left shattered now
We saw the withered body try to shout
You thought the price of your life was devout
And told us some things you cant live without
And was this what was best for us
And was this what was best for us

Just let it show (Rest where you ought to be)
(Block out your misery)
Ill bring you far (Wait for the call)
Well Ill go for it (You left in the hallway)
Ill beg you when you know (People they change)
(And I would still be ashamed)
Ill beg you when it shows (To let the weight of the world)
Well Ill go for it (Rest on your shoulders)
I don't believe the lies (Ill fight until the war is over)
I don't believe the lies (Ill fight until the war is over)
Ill die for you (Ill fight until the war is over)
(Ill fight until the war is over)
I don't believe the lies (Ill fight until the war is over)
I don't believe the lies (Ill fight until the war is over)
Its staged for you (Ill fight until the war is over)
(Ill fight until the war is over)

Left at my feet rests the soul of my brother
Vengeance will fall for the deeds of another---Lyrics submitted by jenny.
