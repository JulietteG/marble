Won the battle, so now buy me clothes
Lets make-believe that we're better off alone
Well, it's me, I implore
I store smiles down in the basement
Even in a perfect world we could not breathe

Now I'm choosing my battles
Now I'm herding the cattle
Now I'm choosing my battles
I am the sow

You remind me of someone
You remind me of someone else[x2]

We could not get up here
The stairs have collapsed on top of us
No one said it was my responsibility
Well I'll get this done
We are up on our backs, 
Helpless, in fact, but slowly moving
Nine-to-five we slave
For people that are underage
I'm slowly moving
I'm slowly moving
Oh, it's the best feeling
Thinking of your' new goals in life
And I never wanted this to happen
But it always does
It's so funny when you speak of love so fluently; 
You have ruined me.
When will this end, when will this end? 
I saved the gats for you and I, decide

We've got to save the weekends for getting our minds blown out
We've got to find the best way for shutting their fucking mouths
When will this end, when will this fucking end? 
Well, Judgement Day is Tuesday
So get your rabbits foots out

Won the battle, so now buy me clothes
Lets make-believe that we're better off alone
Well, it's me, I implore
I store smiles down in the basement
Even in a perfect world we could not breathe

It's like you never felt so
I'll drive the boat[x2]
It's like we've never felt so
I'll drive the boat, I'm arming the laser
It's like you never felt so
Never felt so great, never felt so gold
It's like you never felt so... 
Gold, it hurts
Diamond flavor.---Lyrics submitted by Brenden.
