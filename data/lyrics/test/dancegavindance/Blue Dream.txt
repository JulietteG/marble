Oh, let's start it over As I come back and forth. Through the cause of all my mistake Well you said it over and over "Don't come back don't come around my way" Well I'm already in, give it all. Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down. Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down. Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down. Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down.

(Youll go far on the back of a potato,) (Making French fries in the snow,) (Then youll steal, then youll borrow,) (Youll be red, youll be gold,) (Then youll steal.) (Then youre right in sah dah getti fah da getti tah the betti tah righ.)

Slowly out your face Let it out, let it out, let it out. Place the blame on my hand let it out, let it out, give it all. Give it, give it, give it all falling down, Give it, give it, give it all falling down.

(Youll go far on the back of a potato,) (Making French fries in the snow,) (Then youll steal, then youll borrow,) (Youll be red, youll be gold,) (Then youll steal.) (Then youre right in sah dah getti fah da getti tah the betti tah righ.)

...let it go on wonder Do, do, do, do, don't move Baby stay put. I don't know what I'd do, If I ever lost you.
