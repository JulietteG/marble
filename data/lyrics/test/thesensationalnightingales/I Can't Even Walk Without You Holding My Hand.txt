I thought number one would surely be me,
I thought I could be what I wanted to be.
I thought of myself,what a mighty big man. 
But I can't even walk without You holding my hand. 

 I can't even walk without You holding my hand. 
The mountain's too high and the valley's too wide. 
Down on my knees, I learned to stand. 
And I can't even walk without You holding my hand.
I thought I could do a lot on my own, 
I thought I could make it all on my own 
I thought I could build on, on lives sinking sand
But I cant even walk without you holding my hand

So now I'll give Jesus my all and All  
From now on when I'm in trouble, 
only His name I'm gonna call oh, 
If I don't trust in Jesus, I will be less than a man. 
Cause you see I can't even walk without You holding my hand. 

oh lord, I can't even walk without You holding my hand. 
The mountain's too high and the valley's too wide. 
Down on my knees, I learned to stand. 
And I can't even walk without You holding my hand. 
Down on my knees, I learned to stand. 
And I can't even walk without You holding my hand.---Lyrics submitted by erica jones.
