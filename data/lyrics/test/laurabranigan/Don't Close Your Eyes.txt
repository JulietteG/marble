Turn off the lights
Turn off the television
Turn off everything except for me
You don't need distractions
Just want your reaction
So let me be the star of the greatest film you've ever seen

Don't close your eyes tonight, 
 when you're making love to me
Just like the first time baby,
 let me be your only fantasy
I want you to look at me,
 and tell me I'm the one
Don't close your eyes tonight,
 give me all your love

Every move
Every sound
Makes a slow burn
Move to music inside, that I make you feel

Don't close your eyes tonight, 
 when you're making love to me
Just like the first time baby,
 let me be your only fantasy
I want you to look at me,
 and tell me I'm the one
Don't close your eyes tonight,
 give me all your love

It's so easy for love to start slipping away,
 when the lovin isn't over with
You tell me I look better each day,
 I need you to show me

Don't close your eyes tonight, 
 when you're making love to me
Just like the first time baby,
 let me be your only fantasy
I want you to look at me,
 and tell me I'm the one
Don't close your eyes tonight
Don't close your eyes tonight,
 give me all your love

I want you to look at me,
 and tell me I'm the one
Don't close your eyes tonight
Don't close your eyes tonight,
 Give me all your love

Give me all your love

Give me all your love---Lyrics submitted by Christi Latte.
