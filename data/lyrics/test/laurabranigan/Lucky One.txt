You can break away or you can stay
You choose your life, you're free to fly
Go on and fly
Go on and fly

She had it in her own time
To get away and try to find
Somewhere to go, to run
She saw the world through open eyes
And never let a soul inside
Don't come too close, so close
Baby thinks she's smart, but what about her heart?

Like a wild bird of prey, like a thief in the night
You can take what you want, and you don't think twice
'cos the world's in your hands, you got all you want
And you won't change a thing, you're the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one

Her soul was strong, her heart was tough
And when she felt she had enough
She tore herself away
Love in the dark is all you see
Get what you want, not what you need
You look the other way
Never letting on to what it's all become

Like a wild bird of prey, like a thief in the night
You can take what you want, and you don't think twice
'cos the world's in your hands, and you've got all you want
And you won't change a thing, you're the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one

Life is a dream, the lucky one, the lucky one, the lucky one
Oh, life is a dream, the lucky one
Life is a dream, the lucky one, the lucky one
Baby thinks she's smart, but what about her heart?

Like a wild bird of prey, like a thief in the night
You can take what you want, and you don't think twice
'cos the world's in your hands, and you've got all you want
And you won't change a thing, you're the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one
Oh, the lucky one---Lyrics submitted by czar.
