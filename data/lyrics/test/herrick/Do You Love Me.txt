1  
We lie alone each night  
Face to face together  
And as i watch you sleep  
I search for a trace of forever  

Pre  
But your eyes are closed  
And i cant see the truth  
Ive got to wake you up  
To get through to you  

Chorus  
Do you love me  
Do you love me baby,  
Ive just got to know  
Do you love me  
Do you love me,  
If you dont than let me go  
2  
We're living separate lives  
You and i together  
We've built a wall so high  
I've got to find a way  
To reach you  

Pre  
But your eyes are closed  
And i cant find the truth  
Ive got to shake you up  
To get through to you  

Chorus  
Do you love me  
Do you love me baby,  
Ive just got to know  
Do you love me  
Do you love me,  
If you dont than let me go  

Bridge  
Ive giving it all,  
Loven blind  
Stay or go  
Make up your mind  
Ive got half your heart  
I wanna love thats whole  
Love me or leave,  
Ive got to know  

Pre chorus  
Open up your eyes  
So i can see the truth  
Its time to wake you up  
And get through to you  

Repeat chorus---
