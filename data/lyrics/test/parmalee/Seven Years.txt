Seven years Ive waited here for nothing
I tell myself
I see the colors change so fast they alter
from black to red
Cause Im a burn out waiting
Im suffocating
Rearrange it
Im loosing sleep and
Im alone in my own mind
This place is bringing me down now
and Im going to get whats mine
Yesterday I walked away from everything
To find myself
I saw the colors change
they all turned black
thats how I see myself---Lyrics submitted by Kristin.
