When things get tough you just walk away,
say you don't wanna leave but you ain't gonna stay if
things are gonna stay like they been going lately, baby. But I don't know what you need to hear.
I try to keep you near.
I dry up all your tears.
I tell you that I love you, want you.
What more can a man do?

Baby stay, lay back down in our bed.
Try like hell to get back what we've been missing lately.
Through good and bad I've been here and I ain't going nowhere.
Baby you should know that, by now you oughta know that.

I ain't the kind to love just cause it's easy,
run when it gets harder,
stay because I'm lonely. It kills me you don't know me.
If only you could see inside me...

...you would stay, lay back down in our bed.
Try like hell to get back what we've been missing lately. Through good and bad I've been here and I ain't going nowhere.
Baby you should know that, I think you oughta know that.

Baby stay, lay back down in our bed.
Try like hell to get back what we've been missing lately. Through good and bad I've been here and I ain't going nowhere.
Baby you should know that, I think you oughta know that---
