I waste another day, I cant back up now
Im feeling kind of strange,
because Im on my own now
Adjusting to the change,
of a room thats empty
Its colder now and
Im feeling out of place
When Im gone
I still think about you
When Im gone
I hope you never change
Now I wish the sun would die
And cover up my eyes
So I can sleep again
I wish the sun would die
And wash away the thought
Of seeing you again

Now I cant sleep 
its all coming back to me
I remember your scent on my pillow
And its hard to breathe,
taking all my strength to understand
Why Im this way

When I'm gone
I still think about you
When I'm gone
I hope you never change
Now I wish the sun would die
And cover up my eyes
So I can sleep again
I wish the sun would die
And wash away the thought
Of seeing you again---Lyrics submitted by Marilyn.
