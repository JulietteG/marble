Some want to be a profit of the Lord.
I want be like Jesus
Some what to gain great wealth and fame.
I want to be like Jesus

Chorus:
I want to be like Jesus, 
I want to be like Jesus
Walking in the light, always in the right.
I want to be like Jesus.

Some want to have a big church choir.
Some want to be a healer.
Some just want to fly away.
I want to be like Jesus---Lyrics submitted by Susan Ellison.
