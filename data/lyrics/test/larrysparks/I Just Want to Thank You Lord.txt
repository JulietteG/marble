Chorus:
I just want to thank you Lord,
For every time you heard me pray.
I just want to thank you Lord,  For always being there.
When I was down and out,
You came along and made me want to shout.
I just want to thanks you Lord, Thanks you Lord

If I had a thousand lives to live. Id give them all to you Lord.
Youve been so good to me, That is the least I could afford.
You made the good times outnumber the bad.
You been the best friend Ive ever had.
I just want to thank you Lord, Thank you Lord

When all the world turns against me and I have no place to go,
I just turn to you Lord; Youre the only one I can depend on.
You lift me up when I am down,
You took my whole life and turned it all around.
I just want to thank you Lord, thanks you Lord.

(recite)
I just want to thank you, Lord, For every time youve
Heard me when I pray. And I just want to thank you Lord,
For always being there Ive been so down and out,
But youve always been close beside me, there have been times 
Lord, Youve been the only friend I have. So, I just want to take a minute here to say, Thank you Lord---Lyrics submitted by Susan Ellison.
