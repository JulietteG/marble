I can hardly wait till that day when I hear my Jesus say,
Well down, come home my child. While Im living here 
Below, Im gonna work and Im gonna show how much
I love him. I want to see him smile.

Chorus:
I want to see him smile, well done my child.
Youve done your best come rest a little while.
The world of sin youve overcome. Crown of life
you have won. Most of all I want to see him smile

Well Ive had trouble Ive had sorrow.
I dont worry about tomorrow for I know who hold my hand.
I know if I will do my best surely He will do the rest. 
Hell guide my way to that fair land.---Lyrics submitted by Susan Ellison.
