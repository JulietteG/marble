I read a book about a man
Who never went to school
He could tell you more things about life
Than any man ever knew

He didnt study to be a carpenter
But things he could build
Would stand the storms life could bring
No matter how small or big

Chorus:
And he built a new highway to heaven
And few therell be me that travel thereon
He put me on a new highway to heaven
Theres no detour sign, you dont have to travel alone

He didnt study to be a scientist
Or have a doctors degree
He knew more than any surgeon
Of this world could ever teach

He can remove a stony heart
Put a new one in its place
Jesus does this from inside out
Leaves no scars, no other trace

Repeat chorus

He put me on a new highway to heaven
And few therell be me that travel thereon
He put me on a new highway to heaven
Theres no detour sign, you dont have to travel alone
He put me on a new highway to heaven---
