[ VERSE 1: Willie D ]
As I walked through 5th Ward, I saw this man
He was kind, but he was blind, I snatched his jewelry and ran
I caught up with Face and said, "I think it's worth a grand"
He smiled and he giggled and he shook my hand
We tried to pawn it in time to go to the jam
He said, "It's fake", and I said "What?", he said "I'm sorry", I said "Damn!"
My mama threw me out, I called my sister a whore
Now my house is abandoned, my bed is the floor
It's been a week I didn't eat, I couldn't take it no more
Saw my teacher Miss Elaine at the grocery store
I waited by her car, she asked: "Why aren't you in school?"
Put my gun up to her head and said, "Get in, you old fool"
She offered her keys, cried and said, "Please!"
She promised not to tell and give me A's and B's
I said, "I want your money, grub, and all I can sell"
I looked into her eyes and she was scared as hell
I knew she was a snitch, I beat her down with my gun
Got happy with the trigger, now I'm on the run
An assassin

I'm an assassin

[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
Now I'm just what you expected, a runner out on bail
Hustlin is my job, and I'm paid well
I'm used to makin money fast, beaucoup cash
Try to beat me or cheat me, my boss is bossin your ass
Once lived Sheila, yeah, I meant to kill her
Her teeth was big and gappy, so we called her Godzilla
She planned for a party, she said "Bring everybody"
No jive, when we arrived we saw Dectective Ray McCarthy
I started haul-assin, my Adidas came unfastened
I fell and went to jail and came back as an assassin
First I start wailin, my pockets started swellin
Havin green is havin power, and you know what I was sellin
Now Sheila was addicted, her face looked reflicted
I caught her sellin ass, then and there I should've kicked it
I drove up to her corner and gave her a grin
Asked, "How much?", she said, "20", I said, "Bet", she got in
I drove her to a place that was quiet and dark
She said "yo, turn out the lights and found a place to park"
Now I knew the girl was ready, she started gettin sweaty
But all was in my head was 'kill that bitch like Freddy'
I dug between the chair, and whipped out the machete
She screamed, I sliced her up until her guts were like spaghetti
A maniac, I stabbed the girl in her tits
And to stop her nerves from jumpin I just cut her to bits
An assassin

[ VERSE 3: Bushwick Bill ]
Her father was a priest, cold blooded he's dead
Hypocrite, I caught him basin, so I shot him in the head
Poured on the holy water, "Bless the dead" is what I said
Then heard the demon screamin as his body bled
Now I stole from the poor, lied on the man
Dropped the dime, he's doin time and I don't give a damn
We're not really greedy, we'll help the poor and needy
We'll rock a show and clock some dough, then drink until we're pretty drunk
on the freeway just the other day
I saw a fine hitch-hiker, and I wanted to play
I pulled off the road, so I could offer a ride
She said "Thanks", I said "No thang," and she got inside
Jivin as I was drivin, then I asked which direction
She said, "5th Ward", I said "We're from the same section"
Made it to her ave, she said out and said "Thanks"
I said, "Yo babe, like won't you chill and have a couple of drinks?
We went into my house, and I filled up her glass
She drank and got drunk, that's when I got in that ass
I banged it and banged it until my thang got sore
I said "Honey...", she said "20", I said, "Get out, you fuckin whore!"
She put on her clothes, headed for the door
She said, "Welcome to the disease there is no cure for"
Then she started runnin and almost got away
With no clothes I gave chase, makin sure she'd pay
Now she passed by my boy and I knew he was strapped
Red pulled out his gun and shot the bitch in her back
Bare butt-naked I headed for the car
The massacre was from Texas, so I pulled out the chainsaw
Cuttin and cuttin, he said "Bushwick, man, she's dead"
On the news they found remains of just an arm and her head
An assassin

I'm an assassin

(Don't) (Don't) (Don't fuck with me)

We just was buggin, you know what I'm sayin?
Ha-ha-ha
(Haa-haaa!)
(Don't) (Don't) (Don't fuck with me)
