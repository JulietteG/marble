Ewww, Ewwwww, Ohhh, play the game

To play the game, if you win the game (you've got to win)

It's the new doo review (got the game now how do we play it?)
Comin', comin', comin'
Comin' for you (gonna do the new doo day to day)
It's the new doo review (what would funkers do?)
Comin', comin', comin' (they do what they gotta do)

I wanna do what funk do
I wanna do what funkers do

Do the new doo until it's done
(-?????- sounds like Jessica Cleaves)

Comin, comin', comin' (Do I have a new doo day to day?)

If a little dab won't do ya (Why use Brylcream? It's nothing but water)
If a little dab won't do ya (Your new doo come undone)

If a little dab won't do ya
Go do the new doo day to day

Can you guess who I am?
I was blowin' before the wind
I was before cro-magnon and cro-neanderthal, jivin' before java
Fresh out of monkey-hood

Can you guess who I am?
Wiggle my monkey
Monkey see monkey do (I didn't want to do it
(you made me do it)
Monkey see monkey do (They lied to you. It goes like
This: "If you fakes the funk
Your lip will grow")
Ah - ha -ha
Ah - ha ha ha ha ha

(They lied to you. If you fake the funk your lip will grow)

[This sound ?]

(.....fresh out of monkey-hood)

Blow says the Nose you're growing

[This sound ?]

I will never dance, I will never blow my doo
