Said I 'mo take my shoes off, and kick up my heels

Now here I go, OK hah!

I got some ground work to do (Let's go strollin')
And I need a little support (On the dance floor)
Heel and toe ... (Let's go strollin')
And just like the grinner I need just a little more foot, hah!

Tryin' to put a size twelve foot
In a size eight shoe (you know that won't do)
It's like putting on a five dollar hat
On a nickel head (It's about that hat rack)

Now promenade and do-si-do
Take your partner across the floor
Foot stompin time! Heel and toe - sidesteppin'!

HO!

And kick up my heels
Hey watch me ya'll hear I go
