Grass it is green, cool beneath our feet
Honey, it's sweet, sweet on the bread
The sea and the shore, forever entwined
They all sing the same song

Please come down the coast
Esmeralda, come down and see me sometime
Gabriella, come down and see me sometime
Isabella, come down and see me sometime
Come down the coast

So bring down your good friends, bring down the madmen 
Bring the old tigers, bring down the young turks
Bring out the seers, the confederate dreamers
They all sing the same song

Please come down the coast
Josephina, come down and see me sometime
Magdalena, come down and see me sometime
Rosalina, come down and see me sometime

Esmeralda, come down and see me sometime
Gabriella, come down and see me sometime
Isabella, come down and see me sometime
Valentina, come down and see me sometime
Come down the coast---Lyrics submitted by Anonymous.
