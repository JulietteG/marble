Who but You,
Could breathe and leave a trail of galaxies
And dream of me?
What kind of Love
Is writing my story until the end
With Mercy's pen?
Only You.
What kind of king
Would chose to wear a crown that bleeds and scars
To win my heart?
What kind of Love
Tells me I'm the reason He can't stay
Inside the grave?

You. Is it You?
Standing here before my eyes
Every part of my heart cries

Alive! Alive!
Look what Mercy's overcome
Death has lost and Love has won
Alive! Alive!
Hallelujah, Risen Lord
The only One I fall before
I am His because He is alive.

Who could speak,
And send the demons back from where they came
With just one Name?
What other heart
Would let itself be broken every time
Until He healed mine?

You. Only You.
Could turn my darkness into dawn
Running right into Your arms

Alive! Alive!
Look what Mercy's overcome
Death has lost and Love has won
Alive! Alive!
Hallelujah, Risen Lord
The only One I fall before
I am His because He is

Emmanuel, the promised King
The baby who made angels sing
Son of Man who walked with us
Healing, breathing in our dust
The author of all history
The answer to all mysteries
The Lamb of God who rolled away
The stone in front of every grave

Alive! Alive!
Look what Mercy's overcome
Death has lost and Love has won
Alive! Alive!
Hallelujah, Risen Lord
The only One I fall before
I am His because He is alive.---Lyrics submitted by karla de luna.
