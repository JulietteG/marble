Forget about the past, 
its all in the past, 
Forget about the truth, 
its got nothing to do, 
with you. 

And even though you make me feel this way, 
Id do it again, Id do it again. 
And even through the heart ache and the pain, 
Ido do it again, Id do it again. 
For you. 

I might have been lust, and hit like a truck 
It might have been fate, but it happened to late 
now here I am stuck, in love 
And even though you make me feel this way, 
Ido do it again, Id do it again 
And even through the heart ache and the pain, 
Ido do it again, Id do it again 
For you, aaahhhhh 
For you, and me 
For you ahhhhh 
For you 

And to all those lonely nights 
When I swore Id go insane 
At the mention of your name 
But to speak of you in pain 
Im on my knees again 

If you hold me 
Will it feel the same 
If you hold me 
Then it might just be enough 
To make things right---Lyrics submitted by Dzulfikar Mohammad Adam Kamil.
