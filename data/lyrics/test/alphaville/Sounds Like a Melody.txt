Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singing like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay
Replay replay ay ay ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singing like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay
Replay replay ay ay ay

Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall wit yo friend
I was scared to approach ya
But then you came closer
Hopin you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would be more than friends

We're real worldwide
Breakin all the rules
She like a song played again and again

That girl, like somthin off a poster
That girl, is a dime they say
That girl, is a gun to my holster
She's runnin through my mind all day, ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singing like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay
Replay replay ay ay ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singing like
Na na na na everyday

It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay
Replay replay ay ay ay

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone from night til the morn
Girl you really change my life
Doin things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cookin things she likes

We're real worldwide
Breakin all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife
That girl, like somthingoff a poster
That girl, is a dime they say
That girl, is the gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singing like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay
Replay replay ay ay ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singing like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay
Replay replay ay ay ay

I can be your melody
A girl that could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me

Ay, I can be your melody
A girl that could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me

Ay, na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Shawty got me singin
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Now she got me singin

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singing like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay
Replay replay ay ay ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singing like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my i-pod is stuck on replay
Replay replay ay ay ay---Lyrics submitted by LiZbEtH.
