Baby girl
You're the most consistent thing in my world
No one else can represent like you do
So my life is what you make it

Don't speak
There's nothing else you need to say, you got me
Yeah and you've had me under lock and key
Since the first kiss
Remember that?

So leave all the "he said, she said" behind
I'm playing for you; I'm on your side.
Didn't you know?

Well, if you don't already know
It's game over (game over)
Yeah, if you don't already know
It's game over (game over)

Yeah we play games
Don't always say the things we mean to say
But the feelings that we keep between sheets as we sleep
Make the words irrelevant

So I don't care what they say
Don't listen to people's doubts
Listen to me, just me
It's you I choose
And I'm doing everything I can to make you believe me

So leave all the "he said, she said" behind
I'm still playing for you; I am on your side.
Didn't you know?

Well, if you don't already know
It's game over (game over)
Yeah, if you don't already know
It's game over (game over)

Now, don't worry about what other people say
They're always gonna try to put the sun out with the rain
Just think about the history
Think about it all
Then tell me where do you belong

Well, if you don't already know
It's game over (game over)
Yeah, if you don't already know
It's game over (game over)---Lyrics submitted by nekiyah.
