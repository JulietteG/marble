(Talking)

I'm looking for one female,that i can turn into a spoiled bratt.
I wanna spoil you seven days a week.

(chrous)

I'll buy you gucci and prada
and fly you all around the world
becuz ur so much hotter
than all them other girls
so when we coolin on the eastside
ur coolin with me
but when you pull up in that new ride 
this is all they gonna say(hey)

Damn rite she got it good
hell yeah she got it made(x2)

( verse1)

Millionare-like status,i can make yours the same
big cribs, nice whips, i can get it all arranged
i can get your own cauffeur
i can put you on a plane
clear stones,nice dimond,i can put em in yuh ring
big rocks,flawless ice,i can put it in yuh chain
nice weight,nice hips,i can put it on yuh frame
buy you stocks,buy you bonds, i can put em in yuh name
if you like to ride candy i can put you in the paint
if you like top chef i can put it in yuh drank
if you need a lil paper i can put it in yuh bank
if yuh need a lil sex i can drop it in yuh tank
if you ever get cold i can put you in a mink

i can make you everyday look like a big time model
i can spoil you every day and have you livin on the water

you aint got to cook baby all you got to do is order
if you ever wit me you aint got to spend a quarter
own beautician baby all you got to do is call her
got a closet full of purses every one of em i don bout  em
got ur tee cup yorkie just to match with ur prada
wanna tear down bell hoppa all you got to do is holla
let you act a lil streeter let you drink out of the bottle
send you on vacation with ur girls and ur momma
wanna stay a whole month u can stay long as u wanna
