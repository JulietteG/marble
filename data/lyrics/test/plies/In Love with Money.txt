 if you can count it wit ya hands you aint got enough,
i want a money machine to count mines bruh,
im tired of tha shoebox, wanna see a money truck,
you everythang wit' money, without it ya fucked,
talk to a broke nigga I bet his life rough,
talk to a rich nigga i bet he cheer ya up,
don't need no homeboys' i need my pockets stuffed,
cuz im runnin outta time, nigga im in a rush,
cuz it's a fucked up feelin to feel ya pockets touched,
ya gettin ya quarter now, you shootin for a bird'
ya got ya first stack, now hustle for ya third,
cuz money makes tha world go round if you aint heard,
if I ever go to prison money gon' be tha reason, 
and if im lyin god stop me from breathin,
im tryin to live good homie im tired of strugglin,
and to be honest wit ya dawg' im tired of hustlin,'
