Somebody loves you baby
Oh oh ooh
Somebody loves you baby
Oooohh, ooohh(repeat)

Wish I could hug every nigga who done lost trail
And go see all da ones that visits inna while
To all da goons that's down Wish I can help em smile
To show my niggas I love em I'll walk a hundred miles
Bless my dawg who got killed in his own house
Help him pull through if they on life support now
The only thang I live for is to make my son proud
My heart go out to all da young niggaz that's runnin wild
I said ah prayer for all da mommas who done lost they child
That 12 year old who wanna fuck GOD slow it down
Her life all in shambles Help her to turn it round'
Please reach out nd Help her GOD before she drown

I know dat feelin when it feel like nobody care
When you goin through yo problems itseems like nobody there
I started question myself, "If GOD really care"
Sometimes I cut off all the lights in the room and stare
Wonder if he bought me this far To drop me off here
I know it seems sometimes like Life ain't fair
They say the only thing u can count on in dis world is prayer
I prayed so much I thought that GOD couldn't hear
Cause I done been through so much bullshit this pass year
It's hard to find muafuckaz now dats Sincere
The streets make it so hard for u to think clear
I'd give up all dis shit To have my brother here

I gotta call from my homegirl Her momma died
Somebody home invaded nd took her momma life
I just held the phone n listened to her cry
She kept repeating herself All she asked was "why"
Could only imagine what she goin through on the inside
Cause when my brother went to prison Half me died
Ain't nuttin but pressures in the world homie they lyin'
U gotta take da good with da bad and take it and stride
The right amount of pressure could make u commit suicide
But imagine the pressure onna nigga who can't provide
When everything goin wrong it's hard to do right
You goin through it right now
All I wanna say is...

Somebdy loves u baby ooooohhhh somebody loves you baby---Lyrics submitted by Demetrio.
