She got me speedin' in the fast lane, pedal tothe flo mane. Tryin to get back to her love.
Bez believe she got that good thing, she my little hood thing. Ask around they know us. They Know that's my, Bust it Baby. Everybody know that my Bust it Baby. Everybody know dat my.

If I woun married to the streets itll be you. Yo lips what make you so cute. Love when you poke yo mouth out when you mad too. Save ya number in my phone under Lil' Boo.

Scared to mone round ya cause all you say is ohh. My favorite panties of yours the one that see-through. One wit the pink trim on em and they light blue. Speakin for the goons, thank god for making you. Bust it Baby is wat I call you.

I just gave her nickname, is wet-wet. Cause when we finish she mess up all my bed set. She got some to relax me when I'm under stress. Never told her to let her know that she the best. She like to spell her name with her tounge on my chest. If you would of told me it was dis good I would of never guess. She full of surprises. Ion know wat she'll do next, but while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck. And when she go out she shut down the whole set. Love to see her in heels with the slid in her dress. She like to do her own hair, get her own checks. My Bust it Baby, I keep her on deck.
