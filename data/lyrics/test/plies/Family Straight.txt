(Intro)
You know some people used say money change things.
I'm here to tell you money don't change every motha fuckin thang

(Chorus)
Last ten years momma been working twice a day.
Grandma on a kidney machine, she done lost all the weight.
My auntie go AIDS, she starting to lose her faith.
My brother back in prison, second time he gone away.
My daddy still smoking that shit I can see it in his face.
My lil' cousin 16 pregnant from a nigga 38.
Tryna stay on my son, make sure he's doing what his mama say.
Before you take me God, help me get my family straight.

(Verse 1)
I asked God why he didn't bless me with a silver spoon.
Cause if he did, I would never have had to be a goon.
If he gone change my family, I hope he change em soon.
I'm tired of answering my phone, hearing bad news.
My grandma on a walker, she can barely move.
Just to tell me she love me, take all her breath to do.
She on a kidney machine I know it's hurting too.
4 times a week gotta get her blood drew.
She say the bible and a prayer is the only thing that get her through.
Why my grandma deserve this, god what did she do?
Though just cause I had a lil' money I could buy her a new one.
She hold the family together she's one I can't lose

(Chorus)
Last ten years momma been working twice a day.
Grandma on a kidney machine, she done lost all the weight.
My auntie go AIDS, she starting to lose her faith.
My brother back in prison, second time he gone away.
My daddy still smoking that shit I can see it in his face.
My lil' cousin 16 pregnant from a nigga 38.
Tryna stay on my son, make sure he's doing what his mama say.
Before you take me God, help me get my family straight.

(Verse 2)
My auntie got AIDS and I'm watching her suffer.
Why she gotta die cause she was in love with a hustla.
Even though she's dying, she say's she still loves him.
I know if I see him again, I'll kill that motha fucka.
Only get 15 minutes to talk to my brother, cause he in prison got to go see him if I wanna hug him.
Some niggas willing to lose their freedom just for thuggin.
Cause he made a mistake I gotta be here because I love him.
My uncle just called me, found out his daughter fucking, fucking when they 14 like it's nothing.
In the hood it's happening 10 out of a dozen, that nigga her daddy age that's fucking my lil' cousin

(Verse 3)
My daddy damn near 50, still living with his momma.
Can't even have a family reunion, cause it's always drama.
Last three months I done lost both of my uncles.
Why my family luck so bad, I sit and wounder.
We ain't close like we should and it's taking us under.
The only time we come together, is to have a funeral.
Sit around and talk about each other, spread rumors
I know it's some of my fault, cause I don't talk to em.
For my family to be happy is all I want.
Help my grandma fight, God I know she don't.
To see my mama retire that's all I want.
Hope my brother get out to see his kids for once---Lyrics submitted by nicki.
