I wake up and first things first: Im of service
I make sure your needs are met as a selfless

I give hard and serve hard and now I, I need break
I give big I give all and now its time to regenerate

Todays all about me
All about cup filling
Todays all about me
Learning how, how to receive, how to receive

I move on through offerings often one-sided
Being this low on list of worth: over-extended

I give hard provide hard and now I need some relief
I look out I proffer and now I need some respite indeed

Todays all about me
All about cup filling
Todays all about me
Learning how, how to receive, how to receive

My habit to love you first and me: remainders
Favoring you is so knee-jerk, leaves me a stranger

I give hard impart hard and now I need to retreat
I give out, dedicate and now I need to acknowledge me

Todays all about me
All about cup filling
Todays all about me
Learning how, how to receive, how to receive---Lyrics submitted by lara.
