You, you who has smiled when youre in pain
You who has soldiered through the profane
They were distracted and shut down

So why, why would you talk to me at all
Such words were dishonorable and in vain
Their promise as solid as a fog

And where was your watchman then

Ill be your keeper for life as your guardian
Ill be your warrior of care your first warden
Ill be your angel on call, Ill be on demand
The greatest honor of all, as your guardian

You, you in the chaos feigning sane
You who has pushed beyond whats humane
Them as the ghostly tumbleweed

And where was your watchman then

Ill be your keeper for life as your guardian
Ill be your warrior of care your first warden
Ill be your angel on call, Ill be on demand
The greatest honor of all, as your guardian

Now no more smiling mid crestfall
No more managing unmanageables
No more holding still in the hailstorm

Now enter your watchwoman

Ill be your keeper for life as your guardian
Ill be your warrior of care your first warden
Ill be your angel on call, Ill be on demand
The greatest honor of all, as your guardian ---
