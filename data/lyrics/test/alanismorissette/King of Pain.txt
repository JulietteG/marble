Theres a little black spot on the sun today
Its the same old thing as yesterday
Theres a black hat caught in a high tree top
Theres a flag pole rag and the wind wont stop

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running round my brain
I guess Im always hoping that youll end this reign
But its my destiny to be the king of pain

Theres a fossil thats trapped in a high cliff wall
Thats my soul up there
Theres a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall
Thats my soul up there
Theres a blue whale beached by a springtides ebb
Thats my soul up there
Theres a butterfly trapped in a spiders web
Thats my soul up there

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running round my brain
I guess Im always hoping that youll end this reign
But its my destiny to be the king of pain

Theres a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
Theres a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
Thers a rich man sleeping on a golden bed
Theres a skeleton choking on a crust of bread

Theres a red fox thorn by a huntsmans pack
Theres a black winged gull with a broken back
Theres a little black spot on the sun today
Its the same old thing as yesterday

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running round my brain
I guess Im always hoping that youll end this reign
But its my destiny to be the queen of pain---Lyrics submitted by Yoli.
