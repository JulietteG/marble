Daylight it comes in the nick of time
Shines some light into the darkest corners of her mind
All the world is, all the world is
Weighing down on you

Oooooo ahhhhh

Piece by piece it all falls away
All this beauty, all this magic 'till there's nothing there
If only love was enough I could reach you
I would reach you

I know I'm not tired of you but maybe you got tired of me
Seems like every little thing I do makes you pull yourself away
So I wait for the sun, but you only see the grey
Oh no oh no oh no oh no
Won't you please come on home

Whaaaoooooo
Oooooo
Oh oh oh

Oh, I've been missing you, you got lost along the way
Oh maybe you aren't lost, it's still in you somewhere
If only love was enough, I could reach you
I would reach you

I know I'm not tired of you, but maybe you got tired of me
It seems like every little thing I do makes you pull yourself away
So I wait for the sun, but you only see the grey
Oh no oh no oh no oh no
Wont you please come on home

Na na na na na na
Ooh yeah he yeah he yeah

Seems like every little thing I do
Makes you pull yourself away
So I wait for the sun, but you only see the grey
Oh no oh no oh no oh no
Wont you please come on home

Oooohhhhhhh
Ooooooooo
Aaahhhhhhhh
Yeaaaahhhh

If only love was enough, I could reach you
I would reach you

If only love was---Lyrics submitted by Rach.
