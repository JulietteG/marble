When I woke up today
I got your message on my phone
You said, "hey, I had fun"
"Did you ever make it home?"

I try to read between the lines
Oh yeah, I'm doing fine
Feels like my head is made of moonshine and cheap ass wine
My best friend told me I should just stop looking for a sign

So okay
You told me it was just a one time thing that spark on down
So mean, so what could I say
If you tell me you don't mean a thing
Yes, somebody told me you were mean

But in a couple of days
I get this photograph of you
The message says you lonely too
Do you wanna tell me what to do?
I thought maybe it was a lie
When we spoke that one last time
Sounds like your breath is full of moonshine and cheap ass wine
My best friend told me I should just stop looking for a sign

So okay
You told me it was just a one time thing that spark on down
So mean, so what could I say
If you tell me it don't mean a thing
Yes, somebody told me you were like a machine
And so damn mean
My mind sown a pieces every time I try to jump upon this trampoline

Why don't you tell me what you mean?
Why don't you tell me what you mean?

Why don't you tell me I was just your mistake?
How long can this take?
How many sleepless nights can I go over every second while I'm lying awake, wake?

So okay
If this is really just a one time thing
I think I have lost something
What else can I say?
I don't blame you for a scene
Nothing, yes
Somebody told me I should stay awake
But I can't help it
I want one
One more thing, since I let you stay
I can't put you away
But I don't blame you for a scene
Nothing, yes
Somebody told me you were mean---
