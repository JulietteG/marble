I saw the girl from last December
She said, boy, can you still remember
All those words that you would say
Now, I let you have your way

(1, 2... 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Woo woo, woo woo
All right, wrong, and in between
Woo woo, woo woo
Devils and darlins that's all I breathe
Woo woo, woo woo
Good and evil with a scent of tea
Woo woo, woo woo
Devils and the darlins that's all I need, yeah [4X]

Judging one never seems to be fair
I pray to God or whoever's up there
See, I ain't never gonna change
I will always be this way

[Chorus]

I'm not here to curse
I'm not here to fight
I'm just here to love everyone tonight

(1, 2... 1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Alex Johnston.
