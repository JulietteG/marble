I wake up like a soldier
In a war I don't belong
I'm a sinner who loves angels
Even when they're sometimes wrong

[Chorus]
I'll make no more excuses
Can't change me... I'll be damned
Just hold and love and comfort
And take me... just as I am

When I wander through this village
Of props and I don't know
Yeah they're waiting for that saviour
To say "I told you so"

[Chorus]

Just as I am
Just as I am

Life is moving faster
And time, it fools and slows
Who gives, who takes, who really knows

[Solo]

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Alex Johnston.
