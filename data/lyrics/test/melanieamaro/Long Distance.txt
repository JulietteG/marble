Shadows on the ceiling
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Phone's about to die boy
We should say goodbye boy
Baby I just want you to know

I hate the way I'm feeling
Talking to you ain't enough
I need you to touch me
Why are you so far from me
Baby I've got to let you know

And I just want you to be
More than a picture on my screen
I don't have a choice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
And I want you here with me
When I hear your answering machine
The sound of your voice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
Long distance love

Wherever you are now
I hope I'm what you're dreaming of
Counting down the seconds
Till you're in my arms boy
Baby I've got to let you know

And I just want you to be
More than a picture on my screen
I don't have a choice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
And I want you here with me
When I hear your answering machine
The sound of your voice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
Long distance love

Seems like the further you go now
The more that I want you close now
Tired of being alone now
Baby when you're calling now

Long distance!
Long distance!

And I just want you to be
More than a picture on my screen
I don't have a choice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
And I want you here with me
When I hear your answering machine
The sound of your voice
I can't live without you
I can't sleep at all
And I'm crazy for you
Long distance love ---
