Bell bottoms were really cool.
Cuttin' class an' skippin' school.
I 'member packin' that ol' fishin' pole.
Skinny-dippin' at a swimmin' hole.
Back light, red lights an' strobe lights too,
Were all the rage for me an' you.
Only one thing I miss more than that:
I want my mullet back.

I want my mullet back.
My ol' Camero, an' my eight-track.
Fuzzy dice hangin' loose an' proud.
ZZ Top, they're playin' loud.
A simple time, that's what I miss.
Your mini-skirt an' your sweet kiss.
Things are changin' man, an' that's a fact.
I want my mullet back.

Back. Back.
Back. Back.
Back. Back.

I want my mullet back.
My ol' Camero, an' my eight-track.
Fuzzy dice hangin' loose an' proud.
Lynrd Skynrd, they're playin' loud.
A simple time, that's what I miss.
Your mini-skirt an' your sweet kiss.
Things are changin' man, and that's a fact.
I want my mullet back.

I want my mullet back.
My ol' Camero, an' my eight-track.
Fuzzy dice hangin' loose an' proud.
Bob Seger singin' an' I'm out in the crowd.
A simple time, that's what I miss.
Your mini-skirt an' your sweet kiss.
Things are changin' man, and that's a fact.
I want my mullet back.

I want my mullet back.
I want my mullet back.
I want my mullet back.
I want my mullet back.
