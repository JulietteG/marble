neko come back home 
show me that you care
that love's not just a flare on my sleeve
sleep well
i pray that cardboard boxes set the perfect stage
cause woodgrain makes all man made things seem so out of date
life is not a play it's what we make of the people we love

snails see the benefits
the beauty in every inch so 
why why oh why why why?
are you quick to kiss?

she bites at blades and leaves
goddamn you shrubbery 
i'm sick of vanity plates 
should we move to the uk?
cause life here in the states has escaped
all the people above
like what we make of those people we love

snails see the benefits
the beauty in every inch so
why why why why why?
are you quick to kiss?
baby maybe i spoke too soon
i'll touch you once you make the first move
snails see the benefits
the beauty in every inch

i watch her as she runs
my mother jumps the gun
she puts her in her arms
that is just like my mom
never lets go never lets me grow old
i wanna pay her back
but love is nothing you can tax

my family's not rich by any means
but i feel we won the lottery that day
the rock swallowed the girl 
and i cried as cameras caught my eyes
my tears turn into butterflies
that fly away as caskets close
a new day comes you'll wake unfold and 
smile when you feel the sunlight

snails see the benefits
the beauty in every inch
so why why oh why why why?
are you quick to kiss?
baby maybe i spoke too soon
i'll touch you once you make the first move
snails see the benefits
the beauty in every inch---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
