I'll give you this dance
And I'll give you hope
I'll sing you a song
It's something I wrote
I'll trace you in ink
Connect all the dots
It's not much,
but it's all that I got

I'll give you my heart
And some of my time
And if you do wrong
A piece of my mind
I'll give you some space
If that's what you want
It's not much but it's all that I got

Lettin' it all out,
Breakin' these walls down
Nowhere to hide now
It's not much but it's all that I got

If all I got is the love I was promised, I'm good (I'm good)
Even if it's all I got
If all I got is the touch of your body, I'm good (I'm good)
Even if it's all I got

Let's do it again
Don't want it to end
So baby just keep
Your hands on my skin
I love how it feels
To lay here and talk
It's not much,
but it's all that I got

Lettin' it all out
Breakin' these walls down
Nowhere to hide now
It's not much, but it's all that I got
It's not much but it's all that I got

If all I got is the love I was promised, I'm good (I'm good)
Even if it's all I got
If all I got is the touch of your body, I'm good (I'm good)
Even if it's all I got

You're all I got
I want to be solid as a rock
I'm never gon' stop
Loving you outside the box
It's not much but it's all that I got

If all I got is the love I was promised, I'm good (I'm good)
Baby it's all good, no, even if it's all I got
If all I got is the touch of your body, I'm good (I'm good)
Even if it's all I got

If all I got is the love I was promised, I'm good (I'm good)
Even if it's all I got
If all I got is the touch of your body, I'm good (I'm good)
Even if it's all I got, all I got---
