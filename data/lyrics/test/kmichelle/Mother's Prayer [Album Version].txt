Last night I prayed on a falling star
That you'll never have a broken heart
Though the world is cold just remember who you are
And I pray that you never have a rainy day
And no matter what the people say
Even when hurts it'll be okay

Tomorrow brings new promise
So don't worry bout today
The first time I saw you
I knew my life had changed
I would've been dead and gone
But I found purpose when I brought you home
And even though I'm not there to tuck you in every day
I'm not far away, This is what a mother prays

Last night I prayed on a falling star
That you'll never have a broken heart
Though the world is cold please remember who you are
And I pray that you never have a rainy day
And no matter what the people say
And in your darkest hours I'll help guide your way

Those dreams you have I want you to chase em chase em
This bond that we got let nobody brake it brake it
And when I'm on the road and I can't see your face
And this music will never take your place
I love you chase, I love my chase

Last night I prayed on a falling star
That you'll never have a broken heart
Though the world is cold just remember who you are
And I pray that you never have a rainy day
And no matter what people say
Even when it hurts it'll be okay

Last night I prayed on a falling star
That you'll never have a broken heart
Though the world is cold please remember who you are
And I pray that you never have a rainy day
And no matter what the people say
And in your darkest hours I'll help guide your way
This what a mother prays

Your daddy loves you
And I love you too
Sorry we couldn't work it out for you
But we gone do what's best for you

I pray, Oh I pray, I love you
Cause this what a mother prays---Lyrics submitted by dajiona miller.
