You're a ghost on the highway
And I'll love you forever
Ghost on the highway
And I'll love you forever
Forever and ever
And ever and ever
Your eyes are an island
And I'll hold you forever
Your eyes are an island
And I'll love them forever
Forever and ever
And ever and ever
You're a ghost on the highway
And I'll love you forever
Ghost on the highway
And I'll love you forever
Forever and ever
And ever and ever---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
