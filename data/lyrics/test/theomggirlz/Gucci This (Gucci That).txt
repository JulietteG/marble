I'm so official ya'll
You can check my record.
My dress code is Elevated,
No one can do it better.
What kind of chick you know rock louie from head to toe?
I'm Incredible.
So ATL whatcha know about me?
Frankie B Jeans Jimmy Choos on my feet.
I walk up in the store they already know my name.
Now go into the back and give me one of everything.

[Chorus:]
Gucci This, Gucci That
Gucci Everything [x3]
Louie This, Louie That
Louie Everything [x3]
Give me this, Give me That
Give Me Everything [x3]
Killing this, Killing That
Killing Everything [x2]

[Bahja:]
On my pretty hustle with the fashion,
The way I put my fits together.
Fendi Bag compliment the prada shoes and patten leather.
What kind of chick you know rocks gucci from head to toe?
I'm impeccable!
See you might have the same outfit.
If you ain't got my swagg you can't rock it like this.

[Breaunna:]
When I walk into the store, I know what I want.
One of everything I don't care what it cost.
The Hats, The Scarfs, The Shirt, The Pants.
And I like the case of them sunglasses.
Gotta make sure my bag matches.
My accessories gotta be flashy
Especially cause I'm Classy
Babydoll, and my swagg sassy.
OMG We so live,
This is how we arrive.
My sneaker game is dynamite.
Young Diva Lehgo! We Ride!
Beauty, Star and you got me. My Betsy Johnson Jewelry.
Three of the Cutest things you ever seen!
OMG On Errything.

[Chorus: Zonnique lead]
Gucci This, Gucci That
Gucci Everything [x3]
