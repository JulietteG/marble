Where the boys at?

[Babydoll (Intro)]
HAHAHA omg where you at boy?

[Beauty]
Holla back if you hear me. (Hear me) [x2]
I didn't come out to hang with just my girls tonight.
Cause lately I'm feeling lonely. (Lonely) [x2]
I need the perfect boy to rock my world, that's right.

[Chorus]
Everybody needs somebody.
All the pretty girls wanna have some fun.
I ain't the only girl that wanna meet somebody.
Everybody tryna find the perfect one.
And I'm a little picky not just anybody.
I'm not tryna be greedy give me one of them boys.
If his swag right he could come get me.
I will make it so he never forgets me tell me.
Where the boys at, where the boys at? (boys at) [x2]
If I holla boy holla right back, right back.
Where the boys at, where the boys at? (boys at) [x3]
Cause you give me and my girls something to look at, look at.
Where the boys at, where the boys at? (boys at) [x2]

[Star]
Looking all around the city. (City) [x2]
Lookin' for a fly young thing , to come my way tonight
Kick step and we make it so pretty. (Peerty) [x2]
Turn on my pretty girl swag and I got my girls in here with me.

[Chorus]
Everybody needs somebody.
All the pretty girls wanna have some fun.
I ain't the only girl that wanna meet somebody.
Everybody tryna find the perfect one.
And I'm a little picky not just anybody.
I'm not tryna be greedy give me one of them boys.
If his swag right he could come get me.
I will make it so he never forgets me tell me.
Where the boys at, where the boys at? (boys at) [x2]
If I holla boy holla right back, right back.
Where the boys at, where the boys at? (boys at) [x3]
Cause you give me and my girls something to look at, look at.
Where the boys at, where the boys at? (boys at) [x2]

[Babydoll]
Girl!
Weren't no swag in that room at all.
Definitely not what I'm looking for.
I'm looking for somebody.
With a nearly perfect body.
Pretty smile and some tatts
Where you at, where you at?
You can take me to a party dance with me not anybody else
Be honest when I ask him, "Are you seeing anybody else?"
Riding in the Range at the end of the car
More in love with the fact
His sneaker game of the park
I've been searching near and far for someone whose so official.
Who can let me wear a necklace with his initials?

[Chorus]
Where the boys at, where the boys at? (boys at) [x2]
If I holla boy, holla right back (right back)
Where the boys at, where the boys at? (boys at) [x3]
Give me and my girls something to look at (look at)
Where the boys at, where the boys at?

[Babydoll]
I'm still looking for you. ---
