The first line is always the hardest one to write.
Cause how do you try to explain why your favourite colour is green?

The first touch is always the slightest one to make.

This vivid face of yours
In counted moments,
This childlike sigh of yours
Whenever you are safe,

It all makes me
Curious for more.

The first step is always the toughest one to take
Cause how do you try to explain why your favourite colour is green?
The first step,

This vivid face of yours
In counted moments,
This childlike sigh of yours
Whenever you are safe,

It all makes me
Curious for more.
You make me
Curious for more.
You make me
Curious for more.

It all makes me
Curious for more.
You make me
Curious for more.

It all makes me
Curious for more.
You make me
Curious for more.---Lyrics submitted by Milton.
