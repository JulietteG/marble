So desperate
Hoping for acceptance from
People who were meant to love
But dont, they say its not appreciated
To see what youve chosen
To become

Eyes, eyes, eyes
Just watching you
Waiting, seconds till you fall apart 
Then its over for you
No chances, no chances, none at all 

Their minds seem open
Yet, not exposed
Theyll let you in
But not too close

Youll never know
The obstacles
The certain things that you have no control over

Dont let them see
Dont let them know (6x) 

That youre awake

You see everything through those eyes 
You understand, but they dont  
youre awake

Spit out the rust
Strip the disguise
Dont think twice, no need to agonize
A tooth or two if not, gold will grow, gold will grow
Remember that your mama told you so

Step out from the shadow 
Let everyone see
Black & blue, it dont matter 
Youre free
The fights over, youve won
Raise your bloody fists high,
Breathe
You didnt die 

Youre still here, youre still here 
Open your eyes 
Youre awake
