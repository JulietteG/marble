It's like this

I'm weird and you're weird
Let's be mates
I consider us a pair, so yeah
Let's be mates

You like monkeys, I like monkeys
You like funk, I like it funky
I hate junkies, don't punch me
I'm feelin' a little drumpy

Let's get acquainted
You're simple, I like it
Why are we waitin'?
I'm single, you like it

Follow me outside, I need a cashpoint
You got a light?
Follow me outside, I need a cashpoint
Wait I said that twice

You like my hair, I like it too
To the side, that's not all I do
Do you mind holdin' on for two
While I go do my boogaloo

I'm weird and you're weird
Let's be mates
I consider us a pair, so yeah
Let's be mates

I'm weird and you're weird
Let's be mates
I like that smile that you wear, oh yeah
Let's be mates

You like colors, I like purple
I'm talkin' slow like a turtle
I've had too much herbal
I feel like I'm coughing fur balls

Drink cider like Wurzels
I'm fresh and clean like Purcell
Deliver my words like parcels
I'm the queen in her castle

Let's get acquainted
You're simple, I like it
Why are we waitin'?
I'm single, you like it

Let's conversate
About nothing is timeless
And how I run around
With my invisible minders

I'm weird and you're weird
Let's be mates
I consider us a pair, so yeah
Let's be mates

I'm weird and you're weird
Let's be mates
I like that smile that you wear, oh yeah
Let's be mates

Follow me outside, follow me outside
Follow me outside, I need a cashpoint
You got a light?
Follow me outside, I need a cashpoint
Wait I said that twice

I'm weird and you're weird
Let's be mates
I consider us a pair, so yeah
Let's be mates

I'm weird and you're weird
Let's be mates
I like that smile that you wear, oh yeah
Let's be mates, let's be mates---Lyrics submitted by Moose.
