Yeah
It's officially the biggest midget in the game
I don't know
Make way for the SOV-

Chorus:
Love me or hate me is still an obsession   (X2)
Love me or hate me that is the question
If you love me then, thank you
If you hate me then f**** you

I'm fat I need a diet
No infact i'm just too light 
And I aint got the biggest breastesess
But I write all the best disses
I got hairy armpits but I don't walk around like this
I wear a big baggy t-shirt that hides that nasty
Oooh! Never had my nails done 
Bite them down until their numb
I'm the one with non-existent bum
Now I don't really give a Ughh!
I'm missing my sheperd's pie
Like a high maintnance chick missing her diamonds
I'm missing my Clippers lighters now bow down to your royal highness
No, I don't own a Corgi
Had a hamster it died 'cause I ignored it
Go on then, go on report me
I'm English try and deport me!

Chorus:
Love me or hate me is still an obsession   (X2)
Love me or hate me that is the question
If you love me then, thank you
If you hate me then f**** you

I'm that funky little monkey with the tiniest ears
I don't like drinking fancy champy I'll stick with Heineken beers
Whoops! Might burp in your face
A little unladylike what can I say?
Well oh gosh I'm not a posh me 
I wear odd socks do what I'm doing yeah
So everybodies entitled to opinions 
I open my mouth and sh** I got millions
I'm the middle kid, the riddle kid
I'll make you giggle 'til you're sick
My nose jiggles when I spit 
Yeah, I do have some stories
And It's true I want all the glory 
Go on then, come on support me
I'm English try and deport me!

Chorus:
Love me or hate me is still an obsession   (X2)
Love me or hate me that is the question
If you love me then, thank you
If you hate me then f**** you

Love me or hate me (echo x3)

So I can't dance and I really can't sing    (x2)
I can only do one thing and that's be Lady Sovereign

Chorus:
Love me or hate me is still an obsession   (X2)
Love me or hate me that is the question
If you love me then, thank you
If you hate me then f**** you

Love me or hate me (echo x3)

I can only do one thing and that's be Lady Sovereign

Love me or hate me (echo x3)

I can only do one thing and that's be Lady Sovereign---
