Yeah,
It's officially the biggest midget in the game.
I dunno.
Make way for the S.O.V.

[Chorus (x2):]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!

I'm fat, I need a diet.
No, in fact I'm just here lying
And I ain't got the biggest breast-s-s, but I write all the best disses.
I got hairy armpits, but I don't walk around like this.
I wear a big baggy t-shirt that hides that nasty shit.
Ugh!
Never had my nails done.
Bite them down until they're numb.
I'm the one with the non-existent bum,
Now I don't really give a....Ugh!
I'm missing my shepherd's pie
Like a high maintenance chick missin' her diamonds.
I'm missin' my clippers lighters.
Now bow down to your royal highness.
No! I don't own a corgi.
Had the hamster - it died 'cause I ignored it.
Go on then, go on report me,
I'm English, try and deport me!

[Chorus (x2):]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!

I'm that funky little monkey with the tiniest ears.
I don't like drinking fancy champy,
I'll stick wit Heineken beers.
Whoops, might burp in ya face,
A little unlady-like,
What can I say?
Well oh gosh I'm not posh, me, I wear odd socks.
I do what I'm doing, yeah!
So everybody's entitled to opinions,
I open my mouth and shit I got millions.
I'm the middle kid, the riddle kid,
I'll make you giggle till your sick
Cause my nose jiggles while I spit.
Yeah I do have some stories
And its true I want all the glory.
Go on then, come on support me,
I'm English, try and deport me!

[Chorus (x2):]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!

Love me or hate me
Love me or hate me

So I can't dance and I really can't sing.
I can only do one thing,
And that's be Lady Sovereign!
So I can't dance and I really can't sing.
I can only do one thing,
And that's be Lady Sovereign!

[Chorus (x4):]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!

[x2:]
Love me or hate me
Love me or hate me
Love me or hate me
I can only do one thing,
And that's be Lady Sovereign!
