Yeah,
It's officially the biggest midget in the game.
I dunno.
Make way for the S.O.V.

[Chorus]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then F*** you!
[repeat]

I'm fat, I need a diet.
No, in fact I'm just too light
And I ain't got the biggest breast-s-s, but I write all the best disses.
I got hairy armpits, but I don't walk around like this.
I wear a big baggy t-shirt that hides that nasty s***.
Ugh!
Never had my nails done.
Bite them down until they're numb.
I'm the one with the non-existent bum,
Now I don't really give a....Ugh!
I'm late for my shepherd's pie
Like a high maintenance chick missin' her diamonds.
I'm missin' my clippers size.
Now bow down to your royal highness.
No I don't own a corgi,
Had a hamster, it died cuz I ignored it.
Go on then, go on report me,
I'm English, try and deport me!

[Chorus]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then F*** you!
[repeat]

I'm that funky little monkey with the tiniest ears.
I don't like drinking fancy champy,
I'll stick wit Heineken beers.
Whoops, might burp in ya face,
A little unlady-like,
What can I say?
Well oh gosh I'm not posh, male wit odd socks.
I do what I'm doing YEAH!
So everybody's entitled to opinions,
I open my mouth and s*** I got millions.
I'm the middle kid, the riddle kid,
I'll make you giggle till your sick
Cuz my nose jiggles while I spit.
Yeah I do have some stories
And its true I want all the glory.
Go on then, come on support,
I'm English, try and deport me!

[Chorus]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then F*** you!
[repeat]

So I cant dance and I really cant sing.
I can only do one thing,
And that's be Lady Sovereign!
So I cant dance and I really cant sing.
I can only do one thing,
And that's be Lady Sovereign!---Lyrics submitted by Khristina.
