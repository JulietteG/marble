I'm broken inside
It's too late you're gone
I'm tired of pretending
That the past is undone

I'm not acting like some kind of fool
But I didn't see
Oh, you were out there looking for love
It should have been me

It could have been me
There by your side
It should have been me
Holding you tight

If you're looking for somebody's arms
Let them be
Oh, if you're out there looking for love
It should have been me

Right now my life is filled with emptiness
I gave you all the love that I possess
So unchain my heart, please set me free
Unchain the soul you took away from me

All I'm asking is just one more chance
Can't you see?
If you're out there looking for love
It should have been me

What can I do?
What can I say?
Don't say goodbye
Don't walk away

I didn't think I was making mistake
Too blind to see
Now you're out there looking for love
It should have been me

Oh, if you're out there in somebody's arms
Please let it be
Oh, if you're out there looking for love
It should have been me---Lyrics submitted by kevinbelila.
