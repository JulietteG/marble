Hey there, Father 
I don't wanna bother you 
But I've got a sin to confess 
I'm just 16 if you know what I mean 
Do you mind if I take off my dress? 

Don't know where to start 
Let me get to the good parts 
Might wanna cross up your legs 
I've got envy, I've got greed, anything that you need 
And I'm not above having to beg 
There was this boy who tore my heart in two 
I had to lay him eight feet underground 

All I need is someone to save me 
Cause I am goin' down 
And what I need is someone to save me 
Cause I am goin' down, all the way down 

Well, hey there, Father 
There is just one other thing 
I have a simple request 
I hear you know God could you give him a nod in my direction 
I would be in your debt 

Perhaps there is something that we could work out 
I noticed your breathing is starting to change 
We could go in the back behind all these stacks of bibles 
And get out of this cage 

There was this boy who tore my heart in two 
I had to lay him eight feet underground 

All I need is someone to save me 
Cause I am goin' down And what I need is someone to save me 
Cause God, I'm goin' down, all the way down 

I didn't wanna do it, Father 
But I caught him with another woman in the bed I made him 
So I put him in a grave 

And now there's no one left around to get me off 
When I want it to drag 

The next day on the television they identified him 
By the circumsicion that I made and now I'm on the run 
But wait, why did I have to go and kill him 
When he was the best I'd ever had 

All I need is someone to save me 
Cause I am goin' down 
And what I need is something to save me 
Cause God, I'm goin' down, all the way down 
I'm goin' down 
All the way down---Lyrics submitted by Kori.
