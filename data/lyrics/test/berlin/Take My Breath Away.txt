Watchin' every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame
Turnin' and returning to some secret place inside
Watchin' in slow motion as you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watchin', I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitatin' to become the fated ones
Turnin' and returning to some secret place to hide
Watchin' in slow motion as you turn to me and say, my love

Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you, in time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed, I called you and turned to hear you say
If only for today, I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watchin' every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion, somewhere there's a love in flames
Turnin' and returning to some secret place inside
Watchin' in slow motion as you turn my way and say

Take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love
My love, take my breath away---
