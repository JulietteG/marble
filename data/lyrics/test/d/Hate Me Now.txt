im so damn scared of doubt
as i am listening to the rain
until i figure out
i don't think ill get up again

dont make me kill this
dont make me break us down
its alright for you to
HATE ME NOW

i still feel guilty
even though youre not around anymore
it doesnt help me 
even though i closed the other door

dont make me do this
i really dont know how
its alright for you to
HATE ME NOW---Lyrics submitted by darron.
