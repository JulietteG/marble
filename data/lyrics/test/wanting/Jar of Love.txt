Another sunrise, another sunset
Soon itll all be yesterday
Another good day, another bad day
What did you do today?
Why do we choose to chase what well lose?
What you want isnt what you have
What you have may not be yours to keep

If I could find love, at a stop, in a park with open arms
I would save all my love, in a jar, made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart
Could it be yours to keep, the Jar of Love.

Another left turn, another head turns
Could he be someone I deserve?
Another right turn, another lesson learned
Never leave an open flame to burn
Why do we choose to chase what well lose?
What you want isnt what you have
What you have may not be yours to keep

If I could find love, at a stop, in a park with open arms
I would save all my love, in a jar, made of sparks, sealed in my beating heart,
Could it be yours to keep, the Jar of Love.

Could you be my love X 4

Could you be her love
Could you be his love
Could you be my love
Could I be your love---Lyrics submitted by Vincentlu.
