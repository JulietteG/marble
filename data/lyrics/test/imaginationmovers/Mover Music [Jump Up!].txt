We had a problem but we figured it out
That's what the movers are all about
Everybody let's jump and shout
C'mon!

x2 Jump up,
Get down,
Stand up,
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around

We're working hard and we're having fun
We celebrate when the day is done
It's one for all, and all for one
C'mon!---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
