Everybody shout what's the big idea.
Hey! What's the big idea?
Imagination Movers are music to your ears.
We're music to your ears.
Now, we're the guys who love to figure things out.
What? We love to figure things out.
I say , you need some help just give us a shout.
Hey movers won't you help us out?

Imagination Movers, 
you gotta think about it
Imagination Movers,
you gotta talk about it
Imagination Movers, 
you gotta sing about it
I think what the situation needs is some imagination.

Smitty's my friend he's playing his guitar.
Scott's got his goggles that help him see far.
Dave's over there underneath the red hat.
Now, my name is Rich I go rat-ti-tat-tat

Imagination Movers,
you gotta think about it
Imagination Movers,
you gotta talk about it
Imagination Movers, 
you gotta sing about it
I think what the situation needs is some imagination.---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
