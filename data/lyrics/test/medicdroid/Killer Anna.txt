She walks in as I'm walking out
Should I try this once again? should I try this once again?

And as we kiss I remember how it felt
To fall in love when I was young
But I can't get that feeling back

She's got a killers grin on
Or maybe I'm just too jaded now
My god the killer is waiting

Don't say you care I know you don't
And I won't leave I'll try and pretend
And I won't leave I'll try and pretend

Cause we've got nothing to lose
But time so here we go again

I know you've been patient
But I can't stop from thinking
That when this ends
We'll be the worst of enemies

And now, and as she leaves
I remember times we shared
Can we try this once again?
Cause baby you're just what I need

And as the night grows cold
Well hold me tight, don't let me go

We got it all wrong but baby we'll figure it out
As you say that you care, I know you don't

And I wont leave I'll try and pretend
And I wont leave I'll try and pretend

Cause we've got nothing to lose
But time so here we go again

Dry your eyes, and come home
I feel so alone, and I do know

This is done now, but we will try until the bitter end

But we never made it
Like a bad dream I can't get out
And I can't take another second without you here
We tried time and over as it died
Maybe I'm the one to blame here
Girl just know I love you too
Now we're done so here we go again

I know that I was right (Repeat)---Lyrics submitted by courtney.
