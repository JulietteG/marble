The color of your eyes
run deep through me
I'll stand all alone
and wait for you

down on your ways
down on my ways
girl we're only letting ourselves down tonight

when it comes falling down
It's pouring over me
and all the pain I felt
she said that she feels like she's had enough
she said that she feels like she's had it

waiting for this night to end, when you know
and you know It's over

and girl I hate to say this
maybe It's the wrong time
to bring up the feelings gone
maybe you were right
but I can't do this now so
pretty eyes, I'll say goodnight
I said enough, I'm letting go

It's coming around again
and I just cant pretend I didn't see this here we go
play the record hold me close
now I know you're leaving just tell me that you care
down the road we'll never know, down the road I wanna know

and girl I hate to say this
maybe its the wrong time
to bring up the feelings gone
maybe you were right
but I can't do this now so
pretty eyes, I'll say goodnight
I said enough, I'm letting go

the color of your eyes
run deep through me
I'll stand all alone
and wait for you

I'll sing you to sleep
as you hold on to me
don't stop baby girl
I need you too

and girl I hate to say this
maybe it's the wrong time
to bring up the feelings gone
maybe you were right
but I can't do this now so
pretty eyes, I'll say goodnight
I said enough I'm letting go
pretty eyes, I'll say goodnight
I said enough I'm letting go

the color of your eyes
run deep through me
I'll stand all alone
and wait for you
down on your ways
down on my ways
girl we're only letting ourselves down tonight---Lyrics submitted by Sabby.
