Fallacy is disease
Watched over and guarded

Caught between life and pride
(Carry us)
Rupture the means of those who hold power

Our enforcers have failed
What if failure was always imminent
The future consumes negligence of the past

Our platform bears and bestows intellect
What was once feared is now embraced

This is a time of transcendence
Our ascension, an immaculate rise
Shall reign in the new world

We are forever
We are always
To this, there is no end

Our platform bears and bestows intellect
What was once feared is now embraced
The answers are stitched in the bones of society---
