There are a million roads
Which lead to the same place
The same place

It is the means along the way that awakens us
So wake me up
Perceptions of life

Forgive the foes who have turned away
Through pride grips vitality and must remain
Leave the foundation of which you call home
Only to return or forever alone

Will we be known forever
Forever (Will we be known)
Will we be known forever
Forever

There are a million roads which lead to the same place
It is the means along the way that awakens us
We are not hopeless

Within the unknown
Is it us who chose
Within the unknown
Is it us

Within the unknown
Is it us who chose
Within the unknown
Is it us

Will we be known forever
Forever
Will we be known forever
Forever
Will we be known forever
Forever
Will we be known forever
Forever

Within a world I've never known
Yet so familiar
How could I possibly know
Within a world I've never known

Have we been chosen
Or is it us who chose

Within a world I've never known
Have we been chosen
Or is it us who chose
Within a world I've never known
Have we been chosen
Or is it us who chose

Or is it us who chose

Perception of life is perception of soul
Embrace what's to come
We may not live eternally
Eternity lies within the unknown

Within the unknown---
