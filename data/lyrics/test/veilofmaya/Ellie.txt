These kind words have adopted us
Accepted without question
We live to love
We love to live
A peaceful gift

We claim to be grateful
Though it isn't certain
Standing in pure darkness praying for the light
Pondering recent frames
Allowing access to mistakes I may have made

Where are they
Where are they now

As I stare into a whole made up of dismay
They now face me
Gazing blankly into my eyes

All at once shattering
Leaving only the shards to be replaced

I am putrid
Lay aside the good that I have done

But I am alive

As I stare into a whole made up of dismay
They now face me
Gazing blankly into my eyes

Only the shards to be replaced with guilt
I am putrid---
