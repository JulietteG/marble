I have finally come alive
Collectively we wish to uplift

Some we lose along the way
But there are those who return to reclaim their place
This way we sought is obscure and strange

The deranged form groups of hate
Facing the others with fury
Fires which rage will only be extinguished

Brought to us from the greater force
And all which we take must be given back
We are life and we are death
And of course we are all of the rest

I'm already gone though it seems you're here (I'm already gone)
I will return to you when I am through with this I swear (It seems your here)
I'm already gone though it seems to me you're here
I will return to you when I am through with this I swear

Engulfed in the ocean of life
With only ourselves to protect
Neglect has a consequence
We are life and we are death

The deranged form groups of hate
Groups of hate

Fires which rage will only be extinguished
Some we lose along the way

I'm already gone though it seems you're here (I'm already gone)
I will return to you when I am through with this I swear (It seems your here)
I'm already gone though it seems to me you're here
I will return to you when I am through with this I swear

I will return to you
I will return

I have finally come alive
Collectively we wish to
We wish to uplift---
