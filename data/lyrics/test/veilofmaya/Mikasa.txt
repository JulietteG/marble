Before me there stands an opportunity
There for the taking In this moment - this exact moment
I shall prepare myself
To face a monster of which only I may conquer
Conjure the power bestowed upon our souls
Conjure the power

Align the stones to form a message in the sand
I will never relinquish
It is written in the sand

Which lies below me
Staring back at a helpless man
I've done all I can
It lies in the hands of those who seek a voice soaring above the rest
Built from the ground
Forming scratches upon the surface
We survive in wretched of times
We survive in wretched of times
Conjure the power
We survive in wretched of times
And we thrive in the most wretched of times---
