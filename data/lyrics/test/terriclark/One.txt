I hear the whispers as I walk by
They always start with bless her heart
She's still single and that's such an empty life
She must not be lookin' all that hard
They've all got their stories of why I'm still alone
But the only truth that matters is my own

I want fireworks to paint the sky
A kiss to burns my lips
I wanna feel the touch that pounds my heart
Down to my fingertips
And twenty years from now
It still wont be as good as it will get
It might be a lot to ask for
But I wont take any less
And just because I wont settle
Don't mean I wont settle down
I don't need a love that I can live with
I want the one I cant live without

Momma's always gettin' on me
She says I don't give anyone a chance
But if I can't feel the music when somebody holds me
How am I suppose to dance
There might be a few more lonely nights
But I'm not keepin' score
It's worth the wait for what I'm waitin' for

Fireworks to paint the sky
A kiss to burn my lips
I wanna feel the touch that pounds my heart
Down to my fingertips
Twenty years from now it still wont be as good as it will get
It might be a lot to ask for
But I wont take any less
Just because I wont settle
Don't mean I wont settle down
I don't need a love that I can live with
I want the one I can't live without

And just because I wont settle
Don't mean I wont settle down
I don't need a love that I can live with
I want the one I can't live without
Oh, I can't live without ---
