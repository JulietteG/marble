Oh, people look around you
The signs are everywhere
You've left it for somebody
Other than you, to be the one to care
You're lost inside your houses
There's no time to find you now
Oh, your walls are burning 
And your towers are turning
I've got to leave you here
And try to get down to the sea somehow

(CHORUS)
Rock me on the water
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow
Rock me on the water
I'll get down to the sea somehow

The road is filled with homeless souls
Every woman, child and man
Who have no idea where they will go
But they'll help you if they can
Now everyone must have some thought
That's gonna pull them through somehow
Oh, the fires are raging hotter and hotter
But the sisters of the Son
Are gonna rock me on the water now  ( Repeat Chorus)

Oh, people look among you 
It's there your hope must lie
There's a seabird above you
Gliding in one place
Like Jesus in the sky
We all must do the best we can
And then hang onto that, gospel power
When my life is over 
I'm gonna stand before the Father
But the sisters of the Son 
Are gonna, rock me on the water

Rock me on the water
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow
Rock me on the water, maybe I'll remember; maybe I'll remember how
Rock me on the water, the wind is with me now, Rock me on the water
Gotta get down to the sea somehow...---Lyrics submitted by Oliva.
