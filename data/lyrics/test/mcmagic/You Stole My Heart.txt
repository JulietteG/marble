its mc magic
magic city part 2
u stole my heart girl
i jst wna let u know
theres nobody in this world
that cld ever take ur place
baby i jst wna let u know
theres nobody in this wrld that cld ever take ur place

quiero darte todo mi amor 
me robastes el corazon 
voy a estar contigo hasta el final
baby i jst wna let u know 
theres nobody in this world that cld ever take ur place

girl im trying to love you but you jst wont let me 
i wna touch every inch of ur body slow and sexy 
conversation love jams or whateva 
tell me whut u hide in the corners of ur mind
turn off ur world girl and we cld live inside a dream 
like a movie of the sexiest things uve ever seen 
dont mean to cross the line or even think id disrespect
but im burning with a passion my mind is in a wreck 
and when u look into my eyes its like a magnet
pulling me convincing me that girl i gta have it
maybe im trippin maybe u dont even notice me but then u
smile and once again ur taking over me
que tu quieres q te diga mas intenso cada dia
no puedo resisitir la fantasia
its like my veins are full of fire cant stop it
u got the key to all my dreams so please unlock it

quiero darte todo mi amor 
me robastes el corazon 
voy a estar contigo hasta el final
baby i jst wna let u know 
theres nobody in this world that cld ever take ur place

yeah yeah
cmon
i know u prob think that i cld never be that person 
got my mind all tangled up and im at the point of cursin 
sometimes i think that i shld jst forget this whole desire 
that u was meant for someone else 
but then i know im lying to myself 
i cant run from the truth and desipate the moments 
that im standing close to u this is like a game 
and i was meant to be the winner 
losings not an option i can feel it when im with her 
but then she says maybe we can jst be friends 
that weve been thru a lot together this cld ruin everything 
im saying mama pls open up ur eyes open up ur mind 
its plain to see that u was meant to be with me 
quiero darte todo todo mi amor 
me estas matando y destrosando cuando dices que no 
girl give me tonight and i promise that ill change ur mind 
until ur beggin me to love u girl like every night

quiero darte todo mi amor 
me robastes el corazon 
voy a estar contigo hasta el final
baby i jst wna let u know 
theres nobody in this world that cld ever take ur place

i tried to tell u lil mama that i need u
i try to show u lil mama that i want u
u stole my heart girl
