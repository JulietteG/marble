Be my lady

[Don Cisco (MC Magic in background)]
Don Cisco
Yeah (Pretty, pretty, pretty lady)
And this one's for the ladies
All you sexy ladies out there (Can I make you mine)
Magic, kick this, come on

Chorus: MC Magic
Baby
What I got to do to make you be my
Lady
It's so fly, I got to know your pretty
Lady
Can I take you to my spot, girl, please don't
Play me
Put your body on my body, let's get
Crazy

[Verse 1: Don Cisco]
We party at
The after party, and you know that
She got her body
On my body like a throwback
And I know she like it
Cause she ain't stop me
She just kept grindin'
And said, "Ay papi"
She on me
Like Joni and Tachi
The whole world just watch me
Even the pararazzi, suckers, they can't stop me
Like I'm been dipped in butter, I stay saucy
I'm a boss side flossin', don't trip what it cost me
I rock a roli
Presidential
I ain't gotta say it cause you know my credentials
I came from the projects to livin' residentials
To riding buckets, to hopin' outta Benzo's 
Hey
Lil' momma, won't you ride with me
Girl, you look so fly to me
You need to spend the night with me
Come on

Repeat Chorus

[MC Magic]
Yeah
What's up, you little sexy momma
Let me holla at you right quick
Doing it Magic style for you
Know what I'm sayin'
Yeah
Come here girl, don't be shy

(Verse 2)
Let's put it down like secret lovers
All under the covers
Tu cuerpo y mi cuerpo, oooh baby, like no other
Tu sabes que te quiero
Muy pronto, te encuero
And I gotta put it down like this, yo
Me desespero
From Magic City, Arizona, up to Pomona
Out to Frisco, with Cisco, in California
Take you places that you ain't been before
And put a smile on your face before I hit the door (Mexicali love)
We come a long way from the cold filled jets
To makin' hits
And gettin' them fat royalty checks
Hey
You little momma, won't you ride with me?
You lookin' fly with me
Come spend the night
With me

Repeat Chorus

[MC Magic]
Oooh
Your body
My body
Baby, tell me what it do
Your body on my body
We can do this thang all night
It's Don Cisco and the Magic
And you know we down to ride
