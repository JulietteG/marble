Oh hey, I was listening
I was watching serial
Blinded by the sunshine screen
You, you were in the kitchen oh your,
Mind was marked
And wounded with the wounders whip
And that's how summer passed oh your,
Great divide and range of green green grass
Oh, maybe it was peace at last, who knew

Hello love, my invincible friend
Hello love, the thistle and the burr
Hello love, for you I have so many words that I,
I forget where we were

Oh hey, I was listening,
I was stung by all of us
And blind even affable
And as per usual, you were
Skipping and laughing eyes at the bedroom door
Don't take it so seriously, no
Only time is ours
The rest we'll just wait and see
Maybe you're right babe, maybe

Oh no, and that's how summer passed
Oh your, great divide
And range of green green grass
Oh, maybe it was peace at last, who knew

Hello love, my invincible friend
Hello love, the thistle and the burr
Hello love, for you I have so many words that I,
I forget where we were

I, I forget where we were
I, I forget where we were
I forget where we were, no
I forget where we were, no

Oh no, and that's how summer passed
Oh your, great divide
And range of green green grass
Oh, maybe it was peace at last, who knew---
