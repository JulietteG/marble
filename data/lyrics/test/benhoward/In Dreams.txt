Always a riddle in the world she says
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing to wonder the way we come to be
Oh it's a big old place for me, it's a big old world indeed
Everyone is killing me and everything conspires

Oh in dreams I have watched it spin
See a violent crack of atoms were all that comes in
Oh in dreams I have lain in sin
Just to be the cracked and the cared for

How can I ask, ask for more?

Always a riddle in the world she says
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing to wonder in the way come to be
Oh it's a big old world for me
It's a big old world indeed
Kicking my heels and wondering how I've been here so long

Oh in dreams I have watched it spin
See a violent crack of atoms were all that comes in
Oh in dreams I saw Aesop's kin
Just a carcass of a man, I belong inside his skin

Mmmm mmmmm mmmm

Where to, where to begin?

I live alone now, I live alone in life with out you here

I may be troubled but I'm gracious in defeat
Oh I may be troubled but I'm gracious in defeat---
