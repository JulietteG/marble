The end of the affair
The weight of the world
The kindness gone to bed
It's free of your laughter
Alive in the halls
Did he hear, did he hear
The fumbled words you said

Living without her
Living at all
Seems to slow me down
Living forever
Hell, I don't know
Do I care, do I care
The thunder's rumbled sound

Now I watch her
Running 'round in love again
Now I talk about you
When I'm with our mutual friends

This is it
This is just it
Go to him
What the hell, love?
What the hell?

This is it
This is just it
Go to him
What the hell, love?
What the hell?

This is it
This is just it
Go to him
What the hell, love?
What the hell?---
