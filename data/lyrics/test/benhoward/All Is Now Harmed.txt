As a child he was not there,
Not scared of the flood of the creek
And the thud inside your chest
Clearly calm and keeping terrorized
The ageless pull of winter along the by your side

Here in light on the soft divide?
the middle curtain all?
Pull me down was I born to lie
Here at all, here at all
Here in light I thought I said comes home
I cant do this alone
sleepless light I was born to lie?
Now prove me wrong, prove me wrong

What is in your nature, looms inside your blood
Hold me in harms wake baby, all is now harmed

As a child he was not there,
Not scared of the flood of the creek
And the thud inside your chest
Clearly calm and keeping terrorized
The ageless pull of winter along the bayou side

Here in light I thought I said comes home
(What is in your nature, looms inside your blood)
I cant do this alone
(Hold me in harms wake baby, all is now harmed)
sleepless light I was born to lie?
(What is in your nature, looms inside your blood)
Now prove me wrong, prove me wrong
(Hold me in harms wake baby, all is now harmed)

What is in your nature, looms inside your blood
Hold me in harms wake baby, all is now harmed

What is in your nature, looms inside your blood
Hold me in harms wake baby, All is now harmed---
