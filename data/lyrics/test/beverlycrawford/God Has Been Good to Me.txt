She looked so sleek and sasy
I'm rolling down Rodeo Drive
She got her daddy's black Corniche
And her tennis pro by her side

And she wants her mother's lover
To exercise her skill
And if she don't score him fast
She knows that her brother will

Oh, I wish I were born in Beverly Hills
I swear I couldn't drink half as much as she spills
I want to live it up, get my kicks and thrills
Be a gigolo lover and send her the bills---Lyrics submitted by velva akins.
