She went over to his apartment
Clutching her decision
And he said, did you come here to tell me goodbye?
So she built the sky scraper of procrastination
And the she leaned out the twenty-fifth floor window of her reply
And she felt like an actress
Just reading her lines
When she finally said yes
It's really goodbye this time
And far below was the blacktop
And the tiny toy cars
And it all fell so fast
And it all fell so far

And she said

You are a miracle but that is not all
You are also a stiff drink and I am on call
You are a party and I am a school night
And I'm looking for my door key
But you are my porch light
And you'll never know dear
Just how much I loved you
You'll probably think this was just my big excuse
But I stand committed to a love that came before you
And the fact that I adore you
Is but one of my truths

What of the mother whose house is in flames
And both of her children are in their beds crying
And she loves them both with the whole of her heart
But she know she can only carry one at a time
She's choking on the smoke of unthinkable choices
She is haunted by the voices of so many desires
She's bent over from the business of begging forgiveness
While frantically running around putting out fires

But then what kind of scale
Compares the weight of two beauties
The gravity of duties or the ground speed of joy
Tell me what kind of gauge can quantify elation
What kind of equation could I possibly employ
And you'll never know dear
Just how much I loved you
You probably think this was just my big excuse
But I stand committed to a love that came before you
And the fact that I adore you
Is just one of my truths

So I
I'm going home to please the one that I so love pleasing
And I don't expect he'll have much sympathy for my grieving
But I guess that this is the price
That we pay for the privilege of living for even a day
In a world with so many things
Worth believing in---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
