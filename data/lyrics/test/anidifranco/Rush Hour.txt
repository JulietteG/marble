rush hour
at the day's dawning
the rain came and pushed me under the awning
the puddles grew and threw themselves at me
with every passing car
i'm shielding my guitar
there were some things that i
did not tell him
there were certain things he did not
need to know
there were some days that i
did not love him
he did not understand me
and i don't know why i didn't go
he said change the channel
i've got problems of my own
i'm so sick of hearing about drugs and aids
and people without homes
and i said well, i'd like to sympathize with that
but if you don't understand then
how can you act
i expected summer to be there in the morning
i awoke to the alarm
but she was out of arm's reach
sneaking out on silent thighs
that were spent and sore
from the hot nights that came before
he said i looked for you
and i don't know why
i said i was wearing black
so you could see me against the sky
take your big leather boots
and your buckles and your chains
put them on a downtown train
i expected he would be there in the morning
i awoke to the alarm
he was still in arm's reach
but his body was just a disguise
his mind had wandered off long ago
i could tell by his eyes
love isn't over when the sheets are stained
in my head there remains
so much left to be said
make me laugh, make me cry, enrage me
but just don't try to disengage me---Lyrics submitted by kristina.
