In a city like mine, there's no point in fighting
I close my eyes, see you and me driving
If I am a river, you are the ocean
Got the radio on, got the wheels in motion

[Chorus]
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

I lie in the dark, I feel I'm falling
Feel your hand on my back, hear your voice calling
I'm out of my depth girl, stick close to me
Because the people in this town, they look straight through me

[Chorus]
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

Cause baby I'm not scared of this world when you're here
And baby I'm not scared of this world when you're here

Oh oh oh
You and I we're gonna rise again
Oh oh oh
You and I, we're gonna rise again
We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then---
