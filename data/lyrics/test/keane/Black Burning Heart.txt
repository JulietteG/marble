I wish that I could be
In the cellars of the sea
And disappear in them 
Never to be seen again

Leave this life 
Its unrelenting appetite
For feeding off the weak
Who never had their turn to speak

The sky will be my shroud
A monument of cloud

If we could turn back
You can paper over the crack
But it will return now
And your heart will burn black

Give me your hand
Cut the skin, let me in
The molecules of us
Bleeding into one again

The sky will be my shroud
A cenotaph of cloud

If we could turn back
You can paper over the crack
But it will return now
And your heart will burn black
Forgotten my way home
Forgotten everything that I know
Every day a false start
And it burns my heart

I know everything you said was right and I suppose
Everything is here forever till it goes
You gave it all away, kept nothing for yourself
Just a picture on the shelf

Je souhaiterai  mmmerger dans les profondeurs des mers
Y disparatre pour ne plus jamais tre vu

Burning up
Now Im racing down a road I dont recognise
I realise Ive forgotten my way home
Forgotten everything that I know
Every day a false start
And it burs my heart

Turn back---Lyrics submitted by Lari.
