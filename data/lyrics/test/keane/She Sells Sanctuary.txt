Oh, the heads that turn
Make my back burn 
And those heads that turn
Make my back, make my back burn
The sparkle in your eyes 
Keeps me alive 
And the sparkle in your eyes 
Keeps me alive, keeps me alive 
The world 
And the world turns around 
The world and the world, yeah 
The world drags me down 
Oh, the heads that turn
Make my back burn 
And those heads that turn 
Make my back, make my back burn, yeah
Yeah-hey...

The fire in your eyes 
Keeps me alive 
And the fire in your eyes 
Keeps me alive 
I'm sure in her you'll find 
The sanctuary 
I'm sure in her you'll find 
The sanctuary
And the world 
The world turns around 
And the world and the world 
The world drags me down 
And the world and the world and the world 
The world turns around 
And the world and the world and the world and the world 
The world drags me down 
Ah...
Hey-yeah...
And the world
And the world turns around 
And the world and the world
Yeah, the world drags me down
And the world
Yeah, the world turns around 
And the world and the world 
The world drags me down 
Sanctuary
