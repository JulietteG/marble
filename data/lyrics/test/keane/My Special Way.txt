You and I have wandered through this life,
To feel the pain and ponder what is right.
You took my soul and ran behind the night
Then I cried out for you,
To bring me into view,
But you faded, like the stars in my night.
Now I wake, every morning to love you
every night.
No matter what you are doing,
I still love you, in my special way.
And I wake, every morning to miss you
every night.
But I know, youre happy,
And so, Im happy,
Loving you, in my special way.
Oh I cried out for you,
To bring me into view.
But you faded, like the stars in my night.
Now I wake, every morning, to love you
every night.
No matter what you are doing,
I still love you, in my special way.
And I wake, every morning to miss you
every night.
But I know, youre happy,
And so, Im happy,
Loving you, in my special way.
In my special way.
Ooo, Do do do, Do, do do, Do do do---Lyrics submitted by tac.
