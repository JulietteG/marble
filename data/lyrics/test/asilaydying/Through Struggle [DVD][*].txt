Yeah

Only through struggle have I found rest
With a piece of me taken away
I begin to understand
Hollow out this machine like chest

With its gears that turn to make me feel
And assembled thoughts that fade away

Only through struggle have I found rest
Only through struggle have I found rest

Remove from me (from me)
(This de...) This deception (...ception)
(That I) That I called love (called love)
(That I) That I called love (called love)

Yeah

With its gears that turn to make me feel
And assembled thoughts that fade away

Remove from me (remove from me)
This deception (that I that I)
That I called love (that I called love)
That I called love

Only through struggle have I found rest
With a piece of me taken away
I begin to understand
I begin to understand
I begin to understand
