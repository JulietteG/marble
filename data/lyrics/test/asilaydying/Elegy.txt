Did you ever see me - could you even see at all
I looked at your cold white face, so still, so empty
yet I knew you were
yet I knew you were at rest
much more comforted - than I
what else could I find to replace who you were
It was the carefree unrestricted love that you never meant to give

You never had the choice
You never ment to kill
You never had the choice

It was your innocence
It was part of who you were
what else could I find to replace who you were
It was the carefree unrestricted love that 
you never meant to give
you never had the choice
you never meant to care
you never had the choice

It was your innocence
It was part of who you were
It was your innocence
It was the comfort of a friend
It was your innocence
It was part of who you were
It was your innocence
It was the comfort of a friend
