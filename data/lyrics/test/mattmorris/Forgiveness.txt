I broke in holy lust
And I wept beneath her cross
I cried for whats been lost 
And for all that Ive done

Ive paved a road of tears
And Ive fought this pain for years
Ive wadded through my fears through lakes of fire

But Im looking for forgiveness tonight
Yes Im looking for forgiveness tonight

Well I crawled before the throne
My bleeding heart and my wounded soul
My foolish pride 
The seeds Ive sewn have brought no harvest

But Im looking for forgiveness tonight
Yes Im looking for forgiveness tonight

Oh, heaven bring me peace
And mend this hardened heart
As supple as roses
Oh, when will there be
A brand new start
Can we make it right?

Cause Im looking for forgiveness tonight

I believe in second chances
I know I need one
I know I need you to let me come home
Please let me come home

Cause Im looking for forgiveness tonight
Yes Im looking for forgiveness tonight
