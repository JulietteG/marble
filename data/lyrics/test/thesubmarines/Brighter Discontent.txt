Got a brand new roof above my head 
All the empty boxes thrown away 
I rearranged the place 
A hundred times today 
But the ordering of objects 
Couldn't hide what's missing 

All these things should make me happy 
Make me happy to be home again 
All these things should make me happy 
Make me happy to be alone again 

Got myself a bottle of red wine 
Got a night of nothing else to do 
I think I might know 
What I really want 
But is a brighter discontent 
The best that I could hope to find? 

Got a big black television set 
Now I can watch just what I want 
But I'm here staring up 
At pictures on the wall 
And where are you, 
You're still stuck inside them all 

All these things should make me happy 
Make me happy to be home again 
All these things should make me happy 
Make me happy to be alone again 

But love is not these belongings 
That surround me 

Though there's meaning 
In the memories they hold 
A breaking heart in an empty apartment 
Was the loudest sound I never heard 

Got a desk I'll write myself a note 
Pretending that it came from you 
On hotel stationary 
From the time we first met 
Whatever I can do cause 
I won't throw my hands up yet 

All these things should make me happy 
Make me happy to be home again 
All these things should make me happy 
Make me happy to be alone again 

But love is not these belongings 
That surround you 
Though there's meaning 
In the memories they hold 
A breaking heart in an empty apartment 
Was the loudest sound I never heard 

Well I'll be find if 
I dont look around me now 
Too much for what's gone 
If only I can wait here just a little while 
And let time pass in my room---Lyrics submitted by amjad.
