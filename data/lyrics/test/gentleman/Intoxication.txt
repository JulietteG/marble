Yes empress devine 
Anytime me look ina your face 
You make my world a brighter place 
And your majesty and grace 
A help me through the rat race 

Chorus: 
Joy ina your eyes me nuh see no tears 
Love is what you giving me troughout the years 
Every time you need me I will be there my dear I swear 

There is no faking no heartbreaking 
Like a volcano this ya true love is shaking 
In tender caring we are part taking 
Woman me feel seh big things ina the making 
Intoxication of a certain kind 
I will admit that you suit my mind 
Pulpitation of another kind 
Don't fast forward baby just rewind 


Chorus: 
Joy ina your eyes me nuh see no tears 
Love is what you giving me troughout the years 
Every time you need me I will be there my dear I swear 
Love ina your eyes me nuh see no fear 
Joy is what you giving me troughout the years 
Every time you need me I will be there my dear I swear 

No mistaking in every thing you do 
And I will always be part of you 
Jah Jah made us and he will see us through 
Always and forever babygirl this love is true 
I've been searching for the longtest time 
Almost givin' up never thought I would find 
Seen many roses die on the vine 
But a hidden tressure in you I man find 

Chorus: 
Joy ina your eyes me nuh see no tears 
Love is what you giving me troughout the years 
Every time you need me I will be there my dear I swear 
Love ina your eyes me nuh see no fear 
Joy is what you giving me troughout the years 
Every time you need me I will be there my dear I swear 

On the magic carpet we a ride 
Venus jupiter to the other side 
Fi we togetherness nuh need no guide 
There is nothing to be shame nothing fi go hide 
A whole new world awaits 
Brighter than the pearly gates 
Where love is as strong as fate 
And life is about to give and to take 

Chorus: 
Joy ina your eyes me nuh see no tears 
Love is what you giving me troughout the years 
Every time you need me I will be there my dear I swear 
Love ina your eyes me nuh see no fear 
Joy is what you giving me troughout the years 
Every time you need me I will be there my dear I swear 


There is no faking no heartbraking 
Like a volcano this ya true love is shaking 
In tender caring we are part taking 
Woman me feel seh big things ina the making 
Intoxication of a certain kind 
I will admit that you suit my mind 
Pulpiation of another kind 
Don't fast forward baby just rewind 

Chorus: 
Joy ina your eyes me nuh see no tears 
Love is what you giving me troughout the years 
Every time you need me I will be there my dear I swear 
Love ina your eyes me nuh see no fear 
Joy is what you giving me troughout the years 
Every time you need me I will be there my dear I swear---Lyrics submitted by Roggery.
