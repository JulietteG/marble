Lei ia Mnoa i ta ua
O ka nani i ka mlie
Mea aroha, noho ana i ka lai
Eia n k aloha
Uhola mlie ka noe
Nihi ana i ka nhele
Mea aroha, noho ana i ka lai
Eia n k aloha
Hlii ka uakea i Mnoa
Hoonani i laila i ka nhele
Mea aroha, noho ana i ka lai
Eia n k aloha
Elua taua i ka pilina
Haina mai ana ka puana
Mea aroha noho ana i ka lai
Eia n k aloha
Haina ia mai ka puana
O Mnoa i te hina wai
Mea aroha noho ana i ka la`i
Eia n k aloha

Translation:
Mnoa wears a lei of rain
Ever so calm in its beauty
Beloved one, who dwells in tranquility
Love for you is here
The mist slowly unfurls at Mnoa
Silently creeping through the forest
Beloved one, who dwells in tranquility
Love for you is here
The white misty rain covers Mnoa
Beautifying the woodlands there
Beloved one, who dwells in tranquility
Love for you is here
We two truly joined
The story is told
Mnoa wears a lei of rain
Love for you is here
The story is told
Mnoa is in the mist
Beloved one, who dwells in tranquility
Love for you is here---
