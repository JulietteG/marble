This town is colder now
I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move
I'm shakin' of the rust
I've got my heart set,
on anywhere but here
I'm staring down my self
Counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal
for the life i lead.

[chorus]

Stop and stare
I think i'm moving but i go nowhere
Yeah i know that everyone gets scared
But i've become what i can't be , oh
Stop and stare 
you start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to take what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what i see?

They're trying to come back
All my senses push
Untie the weight bags
I never thought i could...
Steady feet don't fail me now
Gonna run till you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And i'm standing down

[chorus]

but fair ain't really what you need, oh
Stop and stare
I think i'm moving but i go nowhere
Yeah i know that everyone gets scared
But i've become what i can't be , oh
Do you see what i see?...---Lyrics submitted by kaimakami.
