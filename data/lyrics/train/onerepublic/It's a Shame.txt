I tried to get to you
Pushing in vein to break me through
I tried with all I had
But you left me standing empty handed
Well time has passed
Nothing ever lasts

So now you confess that you need me
And now you release what you're feeling
But how is this supposed to ever be the same?

Oh, it's a shame
It's a shame (x2)
Oh, it's a shame, yeah

You've got the best of me
Got me to reason, got me on my knees, yeah
My love, I lost my pride
Searching for something I couldn't find
Well, time apart has brought a change of heart

And now you're convinced that you need me
And now you release what you're feeling
But how is it supposed to ever be the same?

Oh, it's a shame
It's a shame (x2)
Oh, it's a shame, yeah

Well you've got the best of me
I said love got the best of me
Saying, you've got the best of me
And I'm afraid it will never be the same

It's a shame (x2)
Oh, it's a shame (x2)
