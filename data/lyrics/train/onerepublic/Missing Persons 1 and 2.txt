Used to come around here everyday,
now you're breakin.
Used to be the one that is not ashamed,
now you shamin.
Lost in all the wars we fought,
never saw a road.
Now that I think about you in the skies,
I'd turn my row
And I wonder where you are,
now I wonder where you ......
are ......
oooh .......

Take yourself down.
Pick yourself up.
Everything changed when you got along.
7 point 1, took it all down,
Suddenly you can't even be found.
I said all night long.

A missing person's in the window,
staring at me,
saying things I can't hear.
A missing person's in the window,
staring at me,
haven't seen them in years.

(Instrumental)

First things first,
second in command,
right as I'm trying to change my plan.
Second gonna die,
oh he can't breathe,
everybody's staring straight at me.
You spend it all chasing those lies,
I don't really wanna take that chance,
I don't really wanna do that dance,
I don't know what to do till you say.
Oh, I dont wanna let you go,
but I can't keep holding on.
Skies of silver, stars of gold,
And now you know just what you like.

So far this love is all I have.
So far this hurt is all I have.

Missing person at the window,
missing person at the window.
A missing person at the window,
missing person at the window.
I wonder where you are,
I wonder where you are.
I wonder where you are,
wonder where you ......---Lyrics submitted by Joey.
