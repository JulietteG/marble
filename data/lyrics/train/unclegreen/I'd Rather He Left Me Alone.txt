Dean-o's working in the dark of night
Jumping jacks on channel 5
Working late, out of spite
Got no corner in the dark of night

So draw me a spade
I got nowhere to go, yeah
Might as well stay up late
No one waitin' for me at home
Yeah, sure I miss the old times
But that's how I ended up in here
I don't care if the king's up late
I'd rather he left me alone

And all the money left in this world
Can't make me go back how it was
I'm all out of fortitude
So I had to leave the business because
It really got on my nerves
Showed me the things it does

Dean-o's working in the dark of night
But the TV's noisy and bright
Tryin' to focus, tryin' to write
Phone's not ringing in the dark of night

So draw me a spade
I got nowhere to go, yeah
Might as well stay up late
No one waitin' for me at home
Yeah, sure I miss the old times
But that's how I ended up in here
I don't care if the king's up late
I'd rather he left me alone

And all the money left in this world
Can't make me go back how it was
It really got on my nerves
Showed me the things it does

Dean-o's working in the dark of night
Memories in black and white
Sitting in his bed upright
Not so funny in the dark of night

So draw me a spade
I got nowhere to go, yeah
Might as well stay up late
No one waitin' for me at home
Yeah, sure I miss the old times
But that's how I ended up with you
I don't care if the king's up late
I'd rather he left me alone

I'd rather he left me alone
I'd rather he left me alone
I'd rather he left me alone
(Dean-o's working in the dark of night)
I'd rather he left me alone
(Dean-o's working in the dark of night)
I'd rather he left me alone
(Dean-o's working in the dark of night)
I'd rather he left me alone
(Dean-o's working in the dark of night)

I'd rather he left me,
I'd rather he left me---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
