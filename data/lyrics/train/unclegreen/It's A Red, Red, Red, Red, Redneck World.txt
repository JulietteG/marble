I was trying to play some pinball
In an Alabama shit hall
I was talking to a relic
He was very psychedelic
He said, "Let's go smoke a dooby
Having fun and feeling groovy"
Oh yeah

Out in Jackson Mississippi
There's a creature like a hippie
He looks just like Peter Frampton
Like the 80s never happened
With his hair all soft and wavy
Pouring over him like gravy
Oh yeah

Wherever you find yourself
Whereveer the flag's unfurled
It's a red, red, red, red, redneck world

Single lady out in Tucson
And the bar stoool that's she's glued on
Too much liqour in her soda
Now she talks like Abe Vigoda
If you're there when they stop serving
It's a little bit unnerving
Oh yeah

Wherever you find yourself
Whereveer the flag's unfurled
It's a red, red, red, red, redneck world

In the country or metroplis
In Des Moines or Minneapolis
Any dive you happen into
Take a good look all around you
It's a total infiltration
It's a monster truckin' nation
Oh yeah

Wherever you find yourself
Whereveer the flag's unfurled
It's a red, red, red, red
It's a red, red, red, red
It's a red, red, red, red redneck world---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
