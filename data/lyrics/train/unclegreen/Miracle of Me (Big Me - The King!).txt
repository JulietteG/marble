Say a prayer for the common man
Struggling through life the best that he can
You can't hardly blame him, the poor sorry ape
But it's just bad luck, it's only fate

Shed a tear for the multitudes
Be they ignorant, ugly and crude
I try to be patient and kind to the lot
'Cause they'll never have the gifts I've got

But it seems
No one ever sees
The miracle of me
Only God and I
Only God and I

They said I was ahead of my time
'Cause I could read Dostoyevsky at nine
I looked all around me and what did I see?
A world of jumping circus fleas

So say a prayer for the common man
Say another for me, if you can
The pain of achievements, it's lonely, it's great
But it's just bad luck, it's only fate

'Cause it seems
No one ever sees
The miracle of me
Only God and I
Only God and I
Only God and I---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
