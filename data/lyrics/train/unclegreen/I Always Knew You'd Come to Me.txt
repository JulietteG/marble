Whose legs are these?
They're much too thin
I can't get started
I can't begin
I've got a feelin'
I've got the shakes
I've got the low down
Heap big mistake

Turn all the lights on
We got to scatter
I think I'm failing at
The mind over matter
I can't really hear you
But don't take it hard
I can't come near you
Please disregard

I can hear your voice
You call me to you
Hiding somewhere
In the curves of these sheets
I can hear you say
"I always knew you'd come to me."

What are you doin'?
Put on your clothes
What's going on here
Under my nose?
Bring on the mornin'
Bring me sunlight
Somehow it seems I've
Found love tonight

I can hear your voice
You call me to you
Hiding somewhere
In the curves of these sheets
I can hear you say
"I always knew you'd come to me."

Come to me
Come to me

Come to me
Yeah
Come to me
Ah-ha
Come to me
Come to me, Come to me---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
