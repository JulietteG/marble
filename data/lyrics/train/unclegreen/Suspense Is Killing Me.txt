Won't somebody point me in a direction?
Won't somebody tell me where to go?
I'm losing all my powers of recollection
Can't remember things I used to know

Won't somebody send me on a mission?
Won't somebody tell me what to do?
I used to stand behind all my decisions
Where was it that I was coming to?

Every step I take is so hard to do
Tell me what I'm suppose to be
Won't you show me what's behind this curtain?
The suspense is killing me
It's killing me

Won't somebody give me motivation?
Give me some incentive to survive
Just shoot me up with any stimulation
Return to me my love for being alive

Every step I take is so hard to do
Tell me what I'm suppose to be
Won't you show me what's behind this curtain?
The suspense is killing me
It's killing me
Oh, it's killing me---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
