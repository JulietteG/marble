I saw a mass 
of movie stars
Spilling out 
from expensive cars
People brought them frankincense, 
gold and myrrh
Even though they couldn't think 
of who they were

I saw a horde
of Holy Joes
Hinding out 
between the devil's toes
Praying for the evil souls 
of you and I
Who's the god that lets the likes 
of them slip by?

But I feel like the Budha
I feel like the Mona Lisa
I feel like a slowly passing sky
And I don't need a reason
And I don't need an answer, either
I don't need the truth to come to light
'Cause I'm alright

I saw the throngs 
of rubbernecks
Waiting for 
an accident
Couldn't think of any place 
they'd rather be
I thought I saw them salivate 
when they looked at me

But I feel like the Budha
I feel like the Mona Lisa
I feel like a slowly passing sky
And I don't need a reason
And I don't need an answer, either
I don't need the truth to come to light
'Cause I'm alright---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
