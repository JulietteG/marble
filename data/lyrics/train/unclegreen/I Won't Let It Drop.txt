I will stand by your side
With both my legs broken and 
Speak all of those touching words
And leave some unspoken 

And you
You'll never know
You'll never see
What's going on
Inside of me

'Cause I
I will be kind
I'll smile non-stop
But I won't let it drop

I will be your true friend
To use and abuse
Help you in times of need
Though I needed you

And you
You had a place
Yiou had to be
Where someone else
Stepped in for me

Well I
I know that you
Just could not stop
But I won't let it drop

And when all is said and done
You'll tell me you're grateful
But I will say, "It's nothing at all"
And I hide when I'm hateful

And you
You'll never know
How it could be
When you're above
A-covering me

Well then I
I'll be the one
The one on the top
'Cause I won't let it
No I won't let it
No I won't let it drop---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
