I'm exploding
Going crazy
Asking questions, bearing down
I want an answer that can calm the waves I ride

I'm dissolving
Insecure
Losing track, fading out
It's just a fear that's boiling over deep inside

Can't you see that I'm completely terrified
Can't you see that I'm completely terrified

All I want's some kind of guideline
All I want's some kind of clue
I know what you start to think, send it through
No one else can tell me what to do

I'm surviving
Holding out
Standing firm, falling down
It's not knowing what's in store that makes me hide

Can't you see that I'm completely terrified
Can't you see that I'm completely terrified
Can't you see that I'm completely terrified
Can't you see that I'm completely terrified---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
