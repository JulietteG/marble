Well I don't think that I can take it anymore
There must be something you can do
'Cause they're wasting time a-waiting, waiting on a move
It's gotta come from me or you

No I don't think that I can stand it anymore
When's someone gonna give me a spark?
When you wanna shine a light, just turn on the switch
And don't just shoot around in the dark

Now I just wanna make something happen
Yeah I just wanna make something happen
Well I feel like all around me nothin's happenin'
And I just wanna make something happen
Look out

Well everybody's comfortable taking what they get
And no one seems to give a damn
God I'm feeling claustrophobic, stuck in our position
It's caught up in a traffic jam

I was born in '65, I'm a 70's kid
This illusion that was my home town
Now I'm all participation, for cooperation
Wanting to just shout out loud

That I just wanna make something happen
Now I just wanna make soemthing happen
Well I feel like all around me nothin's happenin'
And I just wanna make something happen

Well if I know you
And I think I do
Well you just wanna make something happen too
Are you so frustrated with the world that's around you?
Gotta be something we can all get down to
Gotta be something we can all get down to, yeah

Well I don't think that I can take it anymore
There must be something you can do
'Cause we're wasting time a-waiting, waiting on a move
It's gotta come from me or you

Well, times they aren't a-changing
They're dead in their tracks
And no one wants to push 'em along
So I'm sending out a message
Crying out for help
To anyone who hears my song

Now I just wanna make something happen
Yeah I just wanna make something happen
Well I feel like all around me nothin's happenin'
And I just wanna make something happen
Look out---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
