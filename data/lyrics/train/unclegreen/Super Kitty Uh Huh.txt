You are a super kitty, uh-huh
You're so perverse and pretty, uh-huh

Super
Super
Super
Super
You are a super kitty, uh-huh

You are a bossa nova, uh-huh
You turn the pages over, uh-huh

Super
Super
Super
Super
You are a super kitty, uh-huh

Inside the smallest atom
There is a giant chasm
That science sees with just one eye
But when your name is spoken
That fragile dream is broken
The pieces shatter towards the sky, high

You are a super kitty, uh-huh
You are a super kitty, uh-huh

You are a fight to power, uh-huh
You fertilize the flower, uh-huh

Super
Super
Super
Super
You are a super kitty, uh-huh
You are a super kitty, uh-huh

You are a super kitty, uh-huh
You are a bossa nova, uh-huh
You are a fight to power uh-huh---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
