Tonight, from Hollywood!

One day when Jesus meets Cro-Magnon Man
They'll both give speeches
Shake each other's hands

And then they'll institute a master plan
In simple language
We can understand
Oh, yeah

I hope we don't have to wait
But in the event I'm late
Save a seat for me
Please
Save a seat for me

There'll be a valley where computers bloom
Straining up towards the digital moon
They will be nurtured
They'll be breast-fed too
And one of them
Could look a lot like you
Oh, yeah

I hope it won't take too long
But in the event I'm gone
Save a seat for me
Please
Save a seat for me

Look where you're standing in your patchwork coat
Arrows pointing on the yellow brick road
Look at the future, it's a perfect place
It's a planet of...a super race

One day the sun will start to flicker out
And suck the planets up into its mouth
And in the fury we'll be tossed about
And if I'm leaving you with any doubt
I swear

There's no place I'd rather be
There's nothing I'd rather see
So save a seat for me
Please
Save a seat for me---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
