I saw you on TV
And thought you were just like me
And somehow I seemed to be like you

And when you spoke your mind
I thought it was just like mine
I felt like we'd crossed a line somewhere

Sometimes I can't go to sleep
Sometimes I lie wide awake
Sometimes what you want is too much to take

Sometimes I can't go to sleep
Sometime I lie wide awake
Sometimes what you want is too much to take

Now you're in my head
Or am I in yours instead?
We're both in this single bed tonight

Sometimes I can't go to sleep
Sometimes I lie wide awake
Sometimes what you want is too much to take---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
