He starts with an apology
then works his way down

It's a kind of refrain

The curious perspective
looking up from the ground
Staring out into the faces
of hatred and disdain

Well if you've been the victim of a terrible crime
If you need someone to blame
He'll be the scapegoat anywhere, anytime
He's the guilty party, no one can clear His name

He is the guilty party
Welcome to his mind
Where every single day is 
Guilty party time

People talk of man's cruelty to man
with their fault-finding fingers pointed every which way
They talk as if they can't understand
Like they haven't the capacity to cause any pain
Oh no 
Not me

Now if you're looking for someone to hang
He'll be there on demand
Twenty-four hours, any time of the day
He'll be at your service
Call Him, He's the man

He is the guilty party
Step inside his mind
Where breathing moment is 
Guilty party time

He is the guilty party
Welcome to his mind
Where every single day is 
Guilty party time
