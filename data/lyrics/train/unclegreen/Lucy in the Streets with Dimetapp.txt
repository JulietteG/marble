Lucy 
rose again
Reassembled 
bone and skin
Took a walk around

With her outsized 
jaw and teeth
And her hands that 
looked like feet
Knuckles on the ground

And nobody looked at her
Or said anything
Nobody noticed her
At all.

She went shrieking
through the streets
Trying to find some-
thing to eat
Found an open door

So she went in-
side to rest
In the massive
multiplex
Popcorn on the floor

And nobody looked at her
Or said anything
Nobody noticed her
At all.

'Cause they're all so removed
And they're all so refined
I guess that no one approves
So they put her out of mind

Lucy
fell asleep
But then something
on the screen
startled her to wake

Was her hometown
on the screen
with the mena-
cing machine
Lucy run away!

'Cause no one will look at you
No one will notice you
They won't even look at you
At all.

Because they're all so removed
Because they're all so refined
I guess that no one approves
So they put you out of mind---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
