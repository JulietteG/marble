You got me up in the morning
But I don't think that you've seen my
Point of view
I'm sure that I've got my whole life too

Standing out in the rain
Standing out in the rain
It's not that I'm afraid
But it makes me wonder
Got my backbone when I was younger 

That lookin' off in the distance
Is telling me that 
You're not listening now
You've gotta learn how to care, somehow

Standing out in the rain
Standing out in the rain
It's not that I'm afraid
But it makes me wonder
Got my backbone when I was younger, too

Maybe I 
Let me lie here
Shade of doubt
Day and night here
Maybe I
Let me die here
Let the wind wash away...

Just being up in the morning
Well there's a sign that I've
Really come around

Standing out in the rain
Standing out in the rain
It's not that I'm afraid
But it makes me wonder
Got my backbone when I was younger
Standing out in the rain---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
