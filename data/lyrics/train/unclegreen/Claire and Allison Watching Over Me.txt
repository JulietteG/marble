There's no one famous here,
no one obsolete.
It's as though there wasn't any greater plan.
An exclamation point appeared to us just once.
Pretend it's autumn, and the leaves will all come down.

Sit and pray with me
Staring at the sea
Claire and Alison
Watching over me

The older gentleman had asked me for your name
I didn't recognize their voices for awhile
I took their photographs in semisonic blue
If I stopped wandering, I'd be much better off (Right on!)

In the courtyard
Read a book beneath the tree
Claire and Alison
Watching over me

Write it down for me so I can always remember
Take a picture and I'll try to keep it forever
I'm one step away, but three years behind
Tryin' to see things, that float past my eye

Potentiality is making noise downstairs
I kept the window open to let the evening in
I may have nodded off for 10 or 15 minutes
In other words, this is the dawning of an age

It looks like rain today
All of us agree
Claire and Alison
Watching over me

Write it down for me so I can always remember
Take a picture and I'll try to keep it forever
I'm one step away, but I'm three years behind
Can't trust these things, that float past my eye

It begs a lot of questions
But no one ever asks them---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
