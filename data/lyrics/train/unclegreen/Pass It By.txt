If the lightning just strikes you as too much to take
And the moon only rises to keep you awake
If the world seems to shove, if the world leans to strife
(Pass it by) Drop a penny in the cup and pass it by

Pass it by

If your life starts to feel like a short cameo (oh)
If the cops don;t arrest you for stealing the show (oh)
Well if your slice of life tastes a bit cut and dried (cut and dried)
Drop a penny in the cup and pass it by

Pass it by

There's no use in filing a stream of complaints
You lose all your breath now you crumble and faint
What feels like a drubbing is nothing so drastic
What looks like a fault could be something fantastic
Fantastic, yeah

If the clock keeps alarming you day after day (hey)
If it screams like a banshee to get on your way (hey)
If the time of your life feels a bit by and by (by and by)
Drop a penny in the cup and pass it by

Pass it by
Pass it by
Pass it by---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
