I can't seem to find my mouth
I can't even raise a doubt
The mouth I have is dry 
It has not caught up yet to your eyes 
They are all wet

I am blinded like a dog
You do walk me through a fog
I'm colorblind in the daylight
But still my eyes see colors through the night

Sometimes I wake sometimes I wait
Sometimes I burn and it gets late
Meanwhile its easier to talk straight to myself
When you listen from a shelf
Then it feels like you're here 
Cause I can touch you with my ears
But all those tears
Remain wet behind my eyes
What should I cry for
Tears die upon the floor---Lyrics submitted by Asam.
