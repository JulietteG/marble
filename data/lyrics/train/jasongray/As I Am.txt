When I want to run away
Ashamed of mistakes I've made
I try to hide my face from Your sight
That's when You call my name
And wrap me within Your grace
Hidden in Your embrace I lift my eyes

You love me as I am
Not as I should be
With a love that conquers shame
Jesus, You are saving me

When I went the way I knew
Would lead me away from You
You followed me there to prove You'll never leave
No matter the damage done
Or how far I try to run
When I lose my way, You come to carry me back home

You love me as I am
Not as I should be
With a love that conquers shame
Jesus, You are saving me

Oh forgive me when
I believe my sin
Is stronger than Your love for me
You tell me I am new
That I belong to You
Your love is making me believe

Oh forgive me when
I believe my sin
Is stronger than Your love for me
You tell me I am new
That I belong to You
Your love is making me believe
And it's changing me

You love me as I am
Not as I should be
With a love that conquers shame
Jesus, You are saving me
[x2]

You are saving me
Jesus, You are saving me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
