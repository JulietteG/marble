Maybe you were hurt
By the lies of someone else
Or maybe even worse
Were the lies you told yourself
Maybe you're the one holding up the wall
Or maybe you're the one with the wrecking ball
Even though it's hard to believe
Even with everything you've seen

Even this will be made beautiful
Even this will be made beautiful

Do you feel the pain
Of every blow that knocked you down
Or do you bear the shame
Of every wound you handed out
No matter what you gave or what you received
If you were left or the one to leave
Even though it's hard to hope again
This is not the bitter end

Even this will be made beautiful
Even this will be made beautiful
Scatter the ashes on the wind
Everything will be born again
In His time, in His hands
Beautiful, beautiful

All the broken promises
Every loss of innocence
Every dream that was stillborn
Every "I don't love you anymore"
Every wound, and each regret
Every sickness, all of death
In every heart, to every hurt
Love will have the final word

Even this will be made beautiful
Even this will be made beautiful
Scatter the ashes on the wind
Everything will be born again
In His time, in His hands
Beautiful

Scatter the ashes on the wind
Everything will be born again
In His time, in His hands
Beautiful, beautiful

Beautiful, beautiful
Even this will be made beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
