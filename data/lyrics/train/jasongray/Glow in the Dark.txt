Sometimes the world feels like a mess
Full of drama, full of stress
And life puts a fist right in your ribs
You can hide if you choose to
And no one would even blame you
Or you can let them see how you deal with it

That even in the darkest place
His love can make you radiate

Doesnt matter how deep, how dark the night is
Keep hoping, keep on shining
And theyll see His light burning in your heart
And if the road gets rough, just keep your head up
Let the world see what youre made of
That His loves alive in your deepest parts
Like a flame, like a burning star you can shine right where you are
He made you to glow in the dark

Dont be ashamed of your past
If youre shattered like a piece of glass
The more broke you are the more the light gets through
Show your wounds and your flaws
Show them why you still need the cross
Let them see the work Hes doing in you

That even in the darkest place
His love can make you radiate

Doesnt matter how deep, how dark the night is
Keep hoping, keep on shining
And theyll see His light burning in your heart
And if the road gets rough, just keep your head up
Let the world see what youre made of
That His loves alive in your deepest parts
Like a flame, like a burning star you can shine right where you are
He made you to glow in the dark

Doesnt matter how deep, how dark the night is
Keep hoping, keep on shining
And theyll see His light burning in your heart
And if the road gets rough, just keep your head up
Let the world see what youre made of
That His loves alive in your deepest parts
Like a flame, like a burning star you can shine right where you are
He made you to glow in the dark
Glow in the dark
Doesnt matter how
Glow in the dark
Doesnt matter how---
