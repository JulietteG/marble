Christmas is coming, the bells are ringing
Hope comes alive as music fills the air

Some say Christmas is for children and I believe its true
Can you hear the season calling to the child inside of you?
Awaken from your slumber come see with younger eyes
And be taken by the wonder that took the whole world by surprise!

Christmas is coming, the bells are ringing
Hope comes alive as music fills the air
I hear the drumming, it won't be long now
Christmas is coming, will you be there?
Christmas is coming, will you be there?

They're dressing up the city in a brightly lighted gown
Theres singing in the streets whenever Christmas comes to town
So let the spirit find you wherever you have been
And bring you to the child who makes us children again

Christmas is coming, the bells are ringing
Hope comes alive as music fills the air
I hear the drumming, it won't be long now
Christmas is coming, will you be there?
Christmas is coming, will you be there?

Prepare ye the way
For God's own baby boy
Born to mend all broken things
And to heal the world with joy
He will heal the world with joy!

I don't want you to miss it, I know I have before
Like the innkeeper who missed the wonder right outside his door
So open up your heart as Christmas passes through
Just in time to wake the child asleep inside of you

Christmas is coming, the bells are ringing
Hope comes alive as music fills the air
I hear the drumming, it won't be long now
Christmas is coming, will you be there?
Christmas is coming, will you be there?---
