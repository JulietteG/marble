Every time you lick my hand, my heart starts to kick
Towards the fire we start to dance, burning with each kiss
She is like a virgin, the first time from your eyes
You turned out to be, all that I desire

When I want love, I call on you
When I need love, I run to you
Youre something more than a sweet romance
I get one taste of you, and bang go the bells

Your dreams have become as mine, mine have become yours
Like two ships we sail the night, down to the distance shores
Eyes of blue velvet too, shes got what I want
Round and round on the wheels of love, driving me right out of control

When I want love, I call on you
When I need love, I run to you
Youre something more than a sweet romance
I get one taste of you, and bang go the bells
And all is well, when I look in to those eyes
Bang go the bells
Yeah you got something baby and I just cant deny
Bang go the bells

When I want love, I call on you
When I need love, I run to you
Youre something more than a cheap romance
I just get one look at you, bang go the bells
And all is well, when I look in to those eyes
Yeah you got something baby and I just cant deny, I just cant deny
I just cant deny, bang go the bells
Bang go the bells (repeated until the end)---Lyrics submitted by Jerry Dunn II.
