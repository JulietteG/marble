Dangling above a vat of putrid muck 
A rancid stench of foul decay never encountered before 
Screaming in horror for I now remember my fate 
I will be Submerged In Boiling Flesh 
This cauldron will soon take my life 

Upside down my mind is warping 
Cannot break free 
From teh shackles 
Bloodied chains cut circulation 
Losing reason 
Gag and vomit 

Blisters are forming all over my body now 
Oozing with pus as they start to explode, fervent finality 
The fumes and the vapors have perforated my lungs 
Writhing and twitching from maddening pin 
Why must i die like this? 

Insanity not far away 
Mental breakdown 
Scathing havoc 
Pray for death to come and get me 
Inner anguish 
Begins 

Fear 
Recieved 
Relentless 
Malignancy 

Near the end is what I'm sensing 
Must acccept it 
Can't accept it 
Last attempts to stop this nightmare 
Cannot be done 
I will be dead 

Gone 
Berzerk 
While waiting 
My life will boil 

To struggle is useless 

(Solo: Rob Barrett) 

Plunge 
Fatal 
Paradise 
Of the obscene 

(Solo: Pat O'Brien) 

Enter the tank 
It doesn't take long 
Epidermis dissolved 
All that's left are my bones 
It's a matter of seconds when defleshed in flesh 
My body now part of sick mire 
This chamber of liguefied humans that I have amassed is completed because i was last in line---Lyrics submitted by O'Doyle.
