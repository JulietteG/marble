Runaway, live with me
Lost souls to memory
Running wild and running free
Two kids, you and me

And I say, hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegages
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Renegades
Renegades

Long live the pioneer
Rebels and ...
Go forth and have no fear
Come close and lend an ear

All hail the underdogs
All hail the new kings
All hail the outlaws
Spielberg's and ...
It's our time to make a move
It's our town to make a move
It's our time to break the rules
Let's stay here---
