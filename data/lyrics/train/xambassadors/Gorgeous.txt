I might be better off without you
There's too many people all around you
All these vultures that surround you
They don't know a thing about you

You're so gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous
Oh, so gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous

Nobody understands you
You ain't nothing they can handle
Every man you put your hands on
You make him feel so god damn handsome

I feel, ooh, so pretty whenever you're around
I feel, ooh, so pretty
Feel ten feet off the ground

You're so gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous
Oh, so gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous

We are young, we are free
Like renegades, like James Dean
Beat the drum, sing off-key
You set me free, you set me free

Cause you're so gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous
Oh, so gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous
You're so gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous
So gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous
You're so gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous
Oh, so gorgeous
Cause you make me feel gorgeous---
