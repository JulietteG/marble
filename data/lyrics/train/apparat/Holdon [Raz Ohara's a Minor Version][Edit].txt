There's something alive in a room
And I don't know what it's up to
Some blame it all on the moon
And there's nothin' we could do

And up like to make this thing
Happenin', it's happenin'
So up like to make this thing
Happenin', it's happenin'

Hold on to all we've got
Hold on to all what's left

And let it drop down a wall
For sweat and strobe light
[Tin] [sinless] breakin' balls
It forgot you for all time

And I'm about to sail off Earth
We're driftin' so far
We're driftin' so long
And nothing gonna make me stop
As I proceed
As I proceed... shamelessly

Hold on to all we've got
Hold on to all what's left

Hold on to all we've got
Hold on to all what's left

Came all-in for seventy-five
Just to show ya
All my love, yes all my love
I'm gonna be in my [felony], fraud
It took my quite a while
To lose what I acquired
What I acquired

This fluid off you do, seem so strong
Got a hold of you, a hold of you
But only if you knew what was beyond everything
Everything wouldn't mean a thing

Hold on to all we've got
Hold on to all what's left

Hold on to all we've got
Hold on to all what's left---Lyrics submitted by cesshan.
