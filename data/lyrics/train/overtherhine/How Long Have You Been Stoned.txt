How Long Have You Been Stoned

Whats it like to be the only somebody in the room
Tell us all what does it cost you to be you
Takin out Daddys trash now aint it a drag
Trippin on Papas brand new body bag

How long have you been stoned

Places
Everybody places
Embrace it
Its the way it has to be
Wasted
Is everybody wasted
Complacent
Is anybody free

How long have you been stoned---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
