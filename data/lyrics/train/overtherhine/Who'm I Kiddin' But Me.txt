Walk into the room with that curious grin
Aint nobody need to know the actual shape Im in
But oh, whom I kiddin but me

Call you on the phone, I got nothin to say
Put my lips a little closer and stand there anyway
Cause oh, whom I kiddin but me

I hang from my desire
Like a rope swing from a tree
I kick a little higher
Singin "I Shall Be Released"
But oh, whom I kiddin but me

The devils in the details

Call you on the phone, I got nothin to say
Put my lips a little closer and stand there anyway
Cause oh, whom I kiddin but me

You smell like sweet magnolias
And Pentecostal residue
Id like to get to know ya
And shake the holy fire right out of you
But oh, whom I kiddin but me

The devils in the details---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
