You take your own sweet time
Order us a glass of wine
And wink at all the rich folks in the room
Were gonna pull through

Weve been careful, weve been good
Doing most of the things we should
But the picture is much bigger than we knew
Were gonna pull through

Theres no such thing as cool
And were gonna pull through

Id rather feel your heat
On a wicked winter day
Than watch a holiday parade

With dancers and balloons
Were gonna pull through

You hold me just the same way
Levon would play
And The Weight is my favorite song
Were gonna pull through

Breaking our own rules
Were gonna pull through

Maybe, sorta, kinda
If I really had to say
Something good is on its way
And were gonna pull through---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
