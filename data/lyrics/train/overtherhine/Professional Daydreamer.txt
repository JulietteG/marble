Part of me
You are a part of me
I never want to lose
Hard for me
This is too hard
Maybe I cant get through
What will I miss the most
Pray that Im haunted by your ghost

Listening
Youre always listening
I dont know what to say
Why dont you turn and run at break-neck speed
Just to get away
And when you catch your breath
Pray I said every word I meant

Alright its alright now
Alright its alright

Broken down
Were all so broken down
Bandages on our wings
I know I dont have to tell you
Only broken hearts can sing
Im hoping for a sign
Pray that Im anything but fine

Some things are never gonna change
You ought to know by now---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
