Hes got the hands of a blind piano player
Hes got a feel for the dark like a soothsayer
He takes a little bow and tips his fedora
Shouts like hes gonna save Sodom and Gomorrah

Workin for the circus X railroad bum
Carnival barker for kingdom dot come
Dusty ol Gibson, opposable thumb
Bangs out the rhythm on a 50-gallon drum

Dont wait for Tom
Toms long gone, hes already moved on
Dont wait for Tom
I saw an ol 55 Buick just before dawn
I said, Hey, hey Tom
The suns comin up, you got your wipers on
Are you tryin' to make it rain again?
Are you tryin' to make it rain again?
Is it rainin just around your bend?
Are you tryin' to make it rain again?

Sittin in a corner with his pet muskrat
Tossin his cards into an old mans hat
He grins at the girls, and they always grin back
He bets an old waltz he could get em in the sack

He makes his own music from the bell of a bone
A waitresss falsie and a railroad phone
Bobs on his knees to an old tarantella
South of the border, he stole it from a fella

Dont wait for Tom
Toms long gone, hes already moved on
Dont wait for Tom
I saw an ol 55 Buick just before dawn
I said, Hey, hey Tom
The suns comin up, you got your wipers on
Are you tryin' to make it rain again?
Are you tryin' to make it rain again?
Is it rainin just around your bend?
Are you tryin' to make it rain again?

His triple-jointed juke fingers splay like a scarecrow
He kneels down and whistles to a fallen sparrow
His eyes light up when they wheel in a piano
He reads a dirty joke out of an old Baptist hymnal

He wears a tuxedo made of sackcloth and ashes
Has a tattoo of a girl who can bat her eyelashes
Down on the river, he was fishin with a sword
He knocked off John the Baptist for a word from the Lord

He takes his coffee with the blood of a turnip
Blushes his cheeks with an Amsterdam tulip
Choppin up a rooster for a pullet surprise
If the gravy dont getcha, hell getcha with his eyes
Don't wait

Hey Tom
Sun's comin' up, you got your wipers on---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
