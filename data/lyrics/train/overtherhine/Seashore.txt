Welcome to the goldrush.
Wait till after dark.
Open up the ceiling, well be kneeling,
Well be breathing on a spark.

Flying kites at midnight,
Such a dizzy height.
Up above the small town,
Pulling moonlight down and wearing it skin tight.

You can always tell me
Anything at all.
Think of all the times
Youve let my lips move, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Suddenly im weightless.
Gravity is mine.
I see it with my eyes closed,
What my heart knows: we must leave this world behind.

cause when I wake from dreaming,
Its then im most alive.
Eye lids barely open, no words spoken,
Ah, but you were by my side.

You can always tell me
Anything at all.
Think of all the times
Youve let my lips move, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, what youre missing.
Dont you wanna see what youre missing?

I can always tell you
Anything at all.
Break the alabaster,
Hearts beat faster, yeah, yeah, yeah.

You can always tell me
Anything at all.
Think of all the times
Youve let my lips move, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, what youre missing.
Dont you wanna see what youre missing?---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
