I cry just a little bit
Just a little bit
Everyday

Get by just a little bit
Just a little bit
That way

I know, I know
I should have known

Bluer
Than the blue devils
Bluer than this pale blue angel

Bluer than all of my troubles
Love is never far from danger

I die just a little bit
Just a little bit
Everyday

Get by just a little bit
Just a little bit
That way

Let go, let go
Now that you've gone

Bluer
Than the blue devils
Bluer than this pale blue angel
Bluer than all of my troubles
Are we gonna leave here strangers---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
