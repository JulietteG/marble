The moon blind-sided the sky again
As we grabbed loose ends of the tide and then
The slippery slide
You know I cant say when
I ever took a ride that could slap me this silly
With roiling joy
Lazy as sin
Lyin up in heaven with my special friend
And the space hes in
It can make a girl grin
In the beginning of a lifelong fling

I wrote down a dream
Folded the note
Slipped it in the pocket of my tattered coat

I wrote down a dream
In invisible ink
It never was mine Im beginning to think

I wrote down a dream
What more could I do
I drew myself a picture and the picture was you

I wrote myself a riddle
I said, what I wouldnt do
To give something good
To a love like you

I wrote down a dream
Folded the note
Passed it to you we stepped in our boat

Sailed round the world
We were hoping to find
More than the sum of all we left behind

I wrote down a dream
But what was it now
And why does it feel so distant somehow

Did I take too long
Did I get it wrong
Youre still the missing line in my favorite song---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
