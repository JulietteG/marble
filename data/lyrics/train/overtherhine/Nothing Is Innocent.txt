Wed wake the dead
With voices in our head
Weve gotten used to ignoring the truth

We close our eyes
And breathe and eat the lies
That tell us were so much better than you

Silence is loud
Humility is so proud
Nothing is innocent now

All the kings men
Will serve scrambled eggs again
When white-washed walls come crashing down

Well blink and nod
And say, "How odd"
And wonder why old friends dont come around

Silence is loud
Humility is so proud
Nothing is innocent now

The acid rain
We fear the pain
Will blister and burn the skin

But what is more
The fear we bore
Will eat us alive from within

Silence is loud
Humility is so proud
Nothing is innocent now

For you and me
In the land of the free
Is anything innocent now?---Lyrics submitted by Isabella.
