Dirty little secret, 
Dirty little lies. 
Say your prayers and comb your hair, 
Save your soul tonight. 

Drift among the faithful, 
Bury your desires. 
Aberrations fill your head, 
You need a place to hide 
And I am... 

Do you remember me? 
And the kid I used to be? 
Do you remember me? 

Chorus: 

When your world's come crashing down 
I want to relive. 
(Your god ain't looking down on me!) 

I'm not Jesus, 
Jesus wasn't there! 

You confess it all away, 
But it's only shit to me 
(Your god ain't looking down on me!) 

I'm not Jesus, 
I will not forgive! 

No I won't! 
No I won't. 

I thought you were a good man, 
I thought you talked to god. 
You hippocratic, messianic, 
And child abusing-turned-satanic. 

Do you remember me? 
Do you remember me? 
And the kid I used to be? 
Do you remember? 

Do you remember? 

Chorus: 

When your own world comes undone, 
Let me be the one to say: 
(Your god ain't looking down on me!) 

"I'm not Jesus, 
You can't run away!" 

And the innocence you spoiled 
Found a way to live. 
(Your god ain't looking down on me!) 

I'm not Jesus 
I will not forgive! 

i will not forgive. 
i will not do whatever you want to. 
I will not forgive. 
I will not do whatever you want to. 

Do you remember me? 
And the kid I used to be? 
Not the same as I used to be! 
Oh, do you remember me? 

Nooooooo! 

Chorus: 

When your world's come crashing down, 
I want to relive 
(Your god ain't looking down on me!) 

I'm not Jesus, 
Jesus wasn't there! 

You confess it all away, 
But it's only shit to me! 
(Your god ain't looking down on me!) 

I'm not Jesus, 
I will not, 
I'm not Jesus, 
I will not forgive! 

Oh, I will not forgive, yeah yeah! 
No, I will not forgive!---Lyrics submitted by matt.
