Old friend, what you doin' out there?
Come inside, sit yourself on that chair
Its been a long time, since the last time
And many burdens have passed through our hands
Night into today and day in to night

Do you know what I mean? I'm trying to say I'm sorry
You're the star in the scene, you're not just anybody
There's a light in your eye that I can't seem to reach
Over head, in the sky,
Is it shining on me? Is it shining on me?

I've always knew, that you would not hang around
You and me were like the thieves of the town
Too many girlfriends, but not enough love
Too many late nights, and not enough sleep
Strung out and wasted, no good and shameful
The life we tasted, there on the table

Do you know what I mean? I'm trying to say I'm sorry
You're the star in the scene, you're not just anybody
There's a light in your eye that I can't seem to reach
Over head, in the sky,
Is it shining on me? Is it shining on me?
We have hope in our heart, and dreams in our head, 
But most of the time, we stayed in our bed
If you go out there, you just want more, 
Its a cold, cold world, outside that door.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
