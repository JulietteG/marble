I was so bored before I met you
But then I met you and everything changed
And now it seems I could be amused at the littlest things
If I told my truth

She says you, you should admit it
She know I, I probably won't
That he's the sound you want now
And Im just the noise you don't
And Im just saying it's a bummer, man
Im sorry for interrupting
I guess Ill go

You were my girl you were my baby
You were my homemade mashed potatoes, biscuits, and gravy
You were too good, I should have known
You were a prize my hands could never hold

She says you, you should admit it
She know I, I probably won't
That he is the sound you want now
And I, Im just the noise you don't
And Im just saying it's a bummer, man
Im sorry for interrupting
I guess Ill go

And she says tell me what I need to hear, what I wanna hear or else
I call her baby, I ask her to sit down,
Ask her to sit down and allow me to try to explain myself

She says you, you, you
You should probably admit it, probably admit it
but I, I, I, I, I probably won't, probably won't, probably won't
That he, he, he, he's the sound you want now, the sound you want now
And I, I, I, Im the noise you don't, the noise you don't
I, I, I, I should probably admit it, probably admit it
but I, I, I, I, I probably won't, probably won't, probably won't
That he, he, he, he's the sound you want now, the sound you want now
And I, I, I, Im the noise you don't, the noise you don't

And Im just saying it's a bummer, man
Im sorry for interrupting
I guess Ill go
I guess Ill go
I guess Ill go ---
