The second looks like the hour hand
When it's counting down the rest of our lives
So I'll have to slow up, no steps to follow
Images so haunting survive

Dear youth, what was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands
We left town with nowhere to go
Facing our fears as we breathe

Do you know
What they say they were, reveries
Frustrate the powers at be
What once was blind, but now can see
With a flash... what does it all mean?

So I said goodbye
It's just a memory that doesn't come to be
For not making lies
Long as you're on the right track
Forget the wrong train, nothing is the same

Dear youth, what was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands
We left town with nowhere to go
Facing our fears as we brave the unknown
Dear youth, put back the thoughts in my head
The ones where I believe that I am boundless again
I know, we're at the edge of the world
This was our story, this was our home

We won't the break the world

Alarming world, the days are shrinking
Alarming world, it's moments are fleeting
Alarming world, we gave our best
Alarming world, you know the rest

Alarm the world, the days are shrinking
Alarm the world, it's moments are fleeting
Alarm the world, we gave our best
Alarm the world, you know the rest

Alarm the world, alarm the world---
