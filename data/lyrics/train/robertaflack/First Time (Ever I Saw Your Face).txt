The first time ever I saw your face
I thought that the sun rose in your eyes
and the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
to the dark, and the endless skies my love

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the Earth move in my hand
like the trembling heart of a captive bird
that was there at my command my love

The first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
and I knew our joy, it would fill the Earth
and last till the end of time my love

The first time ever I saw your face
your face, your face, your face---Lyrics submitted by KenB.
