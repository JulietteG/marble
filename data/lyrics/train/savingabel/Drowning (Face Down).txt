Times before I've walked thru the valley below the sun
I've wondered endlessly and waited for my time to come
I think I'm drowning can someone lend a hand 
Can someone save me cuz I don't think I can

Chorus:
I've come to far to to turn around
It's hard to reach for you when 
I'm lying face down
I've carried my soul I'm lost
I'm lost in a moment lying face down

Returning home I find myself wishing I was already gone
How long does it take to fine me when I'm waiting for someone
I think I'm drowning can someone lend a hand
Can someone save me cuz I don't think I can

Chorus:
I've come to far to turn around
It's hard to reach for you when
I'm lying face down
I've carried my soul I'm lost
I'm lost in a moment lying face down

Oh Yeah

I've come to far to turn around
It's hard to reach for you when 
I'm lying face down
I've carried my soul I'm lost
I'm lost in a moment lyin, lyin
I've come to far to turn around

I've come to far to turn around
Lost in a moment 
Lyin face down---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany.
