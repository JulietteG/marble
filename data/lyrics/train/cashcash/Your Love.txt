Saw her in the crowd
Singing  loud
I see your always Hanging around
always hanging around

NIght after night Traffic light
She'll probably let me but i acted polite
acted polite, cuz time's in my way
but there's a chance for us today, So

_Chorus_
Wrap me up in your love girl, yeah
Just wrap up in your love, oh
I can' stop, my love can make you stay
and wrap me up in your love

You did what you did
then you hid, but your still hanging around
turn me upside down
you did what you did
the you hid, and now i never see you hanging around,
 hanging around

Spot in the crowd, singing loud,it's kinda lonely
Havent seen you around, Havent seen you around

NIght after night
Traffic light, will she still let me know?
She's outta my sight, outta my sight
Her eyes keep looking away,
Like there's nothing left to say

( chorus 2X)

Biggest regret I'll ever have
Just hateing myself
one catch i couldn't catch
and now i stand here waiting
ready to make this work

(chorus 2X)
