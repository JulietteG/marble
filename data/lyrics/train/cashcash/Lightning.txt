I was all you thought you ever needed
So you said: How'd I let this slip away?!
On the floor, cold and barely breathing
So it goes!
Sleeping all my dreams away
'Till you found me

Like a lighting ball to heart
You woke me up, woke me up
Yeah, you brought me out of the dark
With just one spark, just one spark!
Now I can feel your pulse
Kick starting this lifeless soul
Like a Lightning ball to heart
You woke me up, woke me up
Yeah!

I was all you thought you ever needed
So you said: How the hell did I let this slip away?
How I lost myself?
I was stumbling right on the edge
You pulled me back, for one last dance
Yeah, I was lost on the darkest road
I need your light to lead me home

Now I can feel your pulse
Kick starting this lifeless soul
Like a Lightning ball to heart
You woke me up, woke me up
Yeah
Like a lightning ball to heart
You woke me up, woke me up
Yeah

Can you feel me
Like I feel you
Can our hearts still be together?
This is our time,
Don't you waste it
We can sing this song forever
Can you feel me
Like I feel you
Can our hearts still be together?
This is our time,
Don't you waste it
We can sing this song forever

Now I can feel your pulse
Kick starting this lifeless soul
Like a Lightning ball to heart
You woke me up, woke me up
Yeah!---
