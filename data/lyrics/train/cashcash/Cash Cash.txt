There's a party in your bedroom
All night long
There's a party in your bedroom
All night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cuz there's a party in your bedroom
All night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone

There's a party in your bedroom
All night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cuz there's a party in your bedroom
All night long
Pretty girl, it's your shot
Let it go when you're alone

This feels right, don't say goodnight

Walking down the street
Keeping hush-hush on the scene
No one knows you
Such a mystery
Opposite of fun 'til you turn the power on
Then you come out
Turning up the heat

Upstairs all alone, one click for a show
Your room feels on fire, you're out of control

There's a party in your bedroom
All night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cuz there's a party in your bedroom
All night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone

This feels right, don't say goodnight

Dancing with your hands
Turning strangers into friends
Touch the keys, please
And unlock my heart
You're free to be a freak
Change your picture every week
Show the camera you're a superstar

Upstairs all alone, one click for a show
Your room feels on fire, you're losing control

There's a party in your bedroom
All night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cuz there's a party in your bedroom
All night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone (x2)

This feels right, don't say goodnight

It's naughty pain
When I think of you, can't stay on track
'Cuz I can't wait
Can't stay on track, can't hide the fact
You're all I want, you're all I need
Let's get this party started
Kickin' hard, just you and me

There's a party in your bedroom
All night long
There's a lot of talk about you
Cuz there's a party in your bedroom
All night long
Pretty girl, it's your show
Let it go when you're alone (x2)

This feels right, don't say goodnight---Lyrics submitted by Holly.
