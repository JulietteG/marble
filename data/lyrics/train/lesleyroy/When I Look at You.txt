Everybody knows, everybody knows,
You're the kind of guy, kind of guy
That a girl like me goes for
Everywhere you go, everywhere you go
People want to know why you're alone
Hanging out on the dance floor
Ripped up jeans, tattoed sleves, so James Dean
But you got it cause you're so hot I could die
Cause when I look at you
I wanna get a room, I wanna get a room

Under all that cool I know you want it too
I know you want it too
What's a girl gotta do to get you out of her mind
And into the groove?
Cause when I looked at you I knew

I've been waiting all night,
Waiting all night
For the right time, right sign,
Just so I can finally make a move,
Cheesy lines from the wrong guys,
Drinking cheap wine,
Waiting till the moment I could get to you
I walk over now, we're getting closer
I'm trembling, I see heaven in your eyes.

Cause when I look at you
I wanna get a room, I wanna get a room
Under all that cool I know you want it too
I know you want it too
What's a girl gotta do to get you out of her mind
And into the groove?
Cause when I looked at you I knew
2x
Cause when I looked at you I knew 2x---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
