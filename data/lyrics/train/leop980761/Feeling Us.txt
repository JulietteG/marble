"IFeeling Us" (LEO Acoustic Live)

What can I give you to make your day
what can I say to brighten your world
Where can I take you that isn't far away
From here, from here

i might not have all the answers but
i'm holding all the standards that can
raise the bar 
to the point 
we exceed your expectations 

so take a leave of absence
i'll heighten all your the senses
you can be the captain
but I can be your spaceship

What can I give you to make your day
what can I say to brighten your world
Where can I take you that isn't far away
From here, from here

cause right here im feeling us
cause right here im feeling us
right here im feeling us
right here im feeling us

who am i to question, love
who am i to question, love
who am i to question this love 
that we have between us
who am i to question, love, love, love

What can I give you to make your day
what can I say to brighten your world
Where can I take you that isn't far away
From here, from here

What can I give you to make your day
what can I say to brighten your world
Where can I take you that isn't far away
From here, from here

What can I give you to make your day
what can I say to brighten your world
Where can I take you that isn't far away
From here, from here

What can I give you to make your day
what can I say to brighten your world
Where can I take you that isn't far away
From here, from here

cause right here im feeling us
right here im feeling us
right here im feeling us
right here im feeling us---Lyrics submitted by LEO.
