Were getting close for all that I know
But I take the most from things that I dont 
And whether youre high or low
Im breathing you in like smoke
Yeah, I know Im getting close to letting go

Losing sight of who you are
Been growing worlds apart
Losing light then something sparks
We're shining through the dark
Shining through the dark

Its coming to me, I feel everything
Yeah were not afraid, Well never be
'Cause whatever hurts the most
Im breathing it out like smoke
I know Im getting close to letting go

Losing sight of who you are
Been growing worlds apart
Losing light then something sparks
We're shining through the dark
We're shining through the dark
Shining through the dark

Everybodys gotta burn brighter
Everybodys gotta reach higher
Everybodys got to find their way out

Everybodys gotta burn brighter
Everybodys gotta reach higher
Everybodys got to find their way out

Losing sight of who you are
Been growing worlds apart
Losing light then something sparks

Losing sight of who you are
Never gonna find it living in the dark
Losing light then something sparks
We're shining through the dark
We're shining through the dark
Shining through the dark

Everybodys gotta burn brighter
Everybodys gotta reach higher
Everybodys got to find their way out

Shining through the dark---
