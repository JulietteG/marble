I cant sink any lower
I wish that I could show her
But blackness surrounds me 
Its like someones trying to drown me

Well I  was homeward bound
Until I heard that sound
The bitterness that blinds

On a thrown where I was crowned
This fable that surrounds 
it pierces and it grinds

Am I a one time winner
That's about to lose it all
Just a two time loser
with my back against the wall

I'm stuck in this dream
and there's no wake up call
How did I fall

I cant hide anymore
I broke the vow I swore
The pieces fall and melt away
I cant keep my demons at bay.

Well, I tried to leave it all behind
But dark is all I find
and it stares me down

I just cant keep climbing anymore
Don't want to know the score
Burn me to the ground

Am I a one time winner
Just a two time loser
Am I a one time winner
That's about to lose it all
Just a two time loser
with my back against the wall
stuck in this dream
and ther's no wake up call
Did I fall and lose it all
How did I miss that wake up call?
I wasn't supposed to take that fall---Lyrics submitted by Becky.
