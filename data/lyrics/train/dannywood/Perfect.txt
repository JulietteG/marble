How much more do I have to give
You assume to much
That I'm like him
Now remember why you looked at me
Fact or fiction, what do you see?
And I can never say enough
And I cant seem to give enough
Well, Did you think that I was perfect
Did you ever have faith in me
Now do you question all the answers
What little there's left to believe
Well, don't you know that your perfect
Just like me.
Well How much more do I have to take
You assume to much
That I might break
Now remember why
why you chose me
Its midnight now there no garuntee
I always tried to make you smile
But I was never worth your while
Did you think that I was perfect
Did you ever have faith in me
And do you question all the answers
What little there's left to believe
Now baby don't you know that your perfect
Just like me
I thought I was ready
for all your twisted ways
You spun me around
Kept me locked up in this maze
I tried to run away
But you always sucked me back in
Ive been blown away
I'm caught in a game
That I just cant win
Nooo, Now did you think  that I was perfect
Did you ever have faith in me
And baby do you question all the answers
Well, isn't there something left for you to believe
Now, did you think that i was perfect
Did you ever have faith in me
Now baby don't you know that your Perfect
Just like me.
Just like me.---Lyrics submitted by Becky.
