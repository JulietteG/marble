Nobody loves me anyway-it's just the whiskey talkin'
I'll never work another day-just the whiskey talkin'
I always wind up on the wrong end of the deal
Can't make a dollar and I'm too scared to steal
Nobody know quite the way I feel
Just the whiskey talkin'
The whiskey talkin' to me

I'm just a shadow of a man- it's just the whiskey talkin'
I get along the best I can-just the whiskey talkin'
I turn around one time the walls come fallin' in
Feel like a loser now and I'm made to win
Too hard to get back on my feet again
Just the whiskey talkin'
The whiskey talkin' to me

How come my old friends never come around?
They never let me down before
They're out there growin' old
Me I'm gettin' down
I don't need 'em anymore

They don't deserve the things they got-it's just the whiskey talkin'
They got it all from me so what-just the whiskey talkin'
I don't need any of that borin' little life
I don't need anything lonely to survive
All that I want is what I've got tonight
Just the whiskey talkin'
The whiskey talkin' to me


How come my old friends never come around?
They never let me down before
They're out there growin' old
Me I'm gettin' down
I'm gettin' right down on the floor

Nobody loves me anyway-it's just the whiskey talkin'
I'll never work another day-just the whiskey talkin'
I turn around one time the walls come fallin' in
Feel like a loser now and I'm made to win
Too hard to get back on my feet again
Just the whiskey talkin'
The whiskey talkin' to me---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
