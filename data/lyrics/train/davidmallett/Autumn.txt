Autumn comes on like a thief
She needs your comfort in her grief
You walk with her in disbelief
But she dies there in your arms

You fear her for the strength she holds
But you love her for the way she folds
The blankets of the years
Around you soft with her sisters charms

With flashing eyes and changing mood
She gathers up her wand'ring brood
Of passing thoughts and dreams renewed 
Beneath her woolen gown

Autumn takes me by surprise
Fancy colors her disguise
But the course of winter must arise 
And the wild geese must go down

Chorus:
Singing goodby to ye mortal men
And goodby to the rain and wind
For us there are no dreams nor sins
Just an ancient winding course

Autumn she's away with men
'Cause she teases them with life
Then she leaves them for another
And they shiver in remorse

Bridge:
The cold that comes to saints and thieves
The hollow sun, the naked trees
The paling field the crumbled leaves
They do their dance of death

I wait for love
I wait for wind
I cannot let the winter in
And i count the places that I've been
And the friends that i have left

Singin'...

Chorus

Autumn she's away with men
'Cause she teases them with life
Then she leaves them for another
And they shiver in remorse---Lyrics submitted by Mike White.
