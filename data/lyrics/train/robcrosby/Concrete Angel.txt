She walks to school with the lunch 
she packed
nobody know what she's
holdin' back
wearing the same dress she
wore yesterday
she hides the bruises with
linen and lace

(oh oh)

the teacher wonders but she 
doesn't ask
it's hard to see the pain behind
the mask
bearing the burden of a 
secret storm
sometimes she wishes she was
never born

Chorus:
through the wind and the rain
she stands hard as a stone
in a world that she can't rise above
but her dreams give her wings 
and she flies to a place where 
she's loved 
concrete angel

somebody cries in the middle
of the night
the niebors hear,but they 
turn out the lights
a fragile soul caught in the hands 
of fate
when mornin' comes it'll
be to late

 repeat chorus

a statue stands in a 
shaded place
an angel girl with an 
upturned face
a name is written on a polished rock
a broken heart that the world forgot

repeat chorus---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlyn.
