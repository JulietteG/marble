I'll tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus and that was that
There's more to this than passing by
There's more to this than meets the eye
I'll tell you what it's going to be like
I saw you on the bus, I saw your shoes
They fell apart some time ago
I'll buy some more in five years

It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing

I'll tell you what its going to feel like
You lost a limb and you can feel it
If you leave, at night, not by my side
Cause I'm not there to hold you too tight

Leave, I'll tell you what its going to be like
No you can never hold my hand
If only they can know or understand
That you and me are now together

It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing
It's not my fault, I don't care
I don't regret a single thing

Oh oh, you can have it all, if that's alright
Oh I will give it all to you, cause you never lied before
And you can have it all, if that's alright
And you can have it all, if it's alright, oh oh---Lyrics submitted by carlymarie.
