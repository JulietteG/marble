Let it never be said that the romance is dead
'Cause there's so little else occupying my head
There is nothing I need except the function to breathe
But I'm not really fussed, doesn't matter to me

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Aha-aha-aaa
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Aha-aha-aaa
Know what ya doing, doing to me?
Aha-aha-aaa
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Aha-aha-aaa

Due to lack of interest, tomorrow is canceled
Let the clocks be reset and the pendulums held
'Cause there's nothing at all except the space in between
Finding out what you're called and repeating your name

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Aha-aha-aaa
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Aha-aha-aaa
Know what ya doing, doing to me?
Aha-aha-aaa
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Aha-aha-aaa-aaa

Could it be, could it be that you're joking with me
And you don't really see you with me?
Could it be, could it be that you're joking with me
And you don't really see you with me?

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Aha-aha-aaa
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Aha-aha-aaa
Know what ya doing, doing to me?
Aha-aha-aaa
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Aha-aha-aaa
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Aha-aha-aaa (Da da da, da da da)
Know what ya doing, doing to me?
Aha-aha-aaa, aaa (Da da da)---
