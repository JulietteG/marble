Follow the underdog
Hold on his collar tight
This city loves a scrap
One day it's gonna bite
Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from having a good day
On a bad day
There's good days and bad days

Making a night of it
Breaking down barriers
Drowning your sorrows
Upset the regulars
Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from getting away with
Good days on bad days
There's good days on bad days
There's good days and bad days

If you had a different attitude
Instead of take and take and take
You have missed an opportunity
And that's a really big mistake
If you had a different attitude
You'd still have good days and bad days---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
