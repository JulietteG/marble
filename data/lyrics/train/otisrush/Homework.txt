Oh baby, I may be a fool
Wastin' my time by goin' to school
The way you got me lovin' you so
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore

Oh baby, you got me so blind
I'm walkin' 'round in circles 'bout to lose my mind
The way you got me lovin' you so
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore

Now baby, you're as sweet as you can be
Everything you do is sending me
If it's the kiss of your lips or the touch of your hand
Whatever you do is really grand

Oh baby, what can I do
I'm walkin' 'round in circles in love with you
The way you got me lovin' you so
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore---Lyrics submitted by Ross Morris.
