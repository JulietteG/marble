-Chorus-
You're a dime (so beautiful)
Top of the line (so unushual)
Words can't define 
You're runnin through my mind all day (day, day)
I'm so happy you're mine (so beautiful)
Top of the line (so unushual)
Now I think it's time (hey shawty)
I hope you don't take this the wrong way
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off (ooh)
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off (ooh)
(better with the lights off)

Hey miss america
What you look so sad for?
Sweet heart, You only live one time
So put your fantasies on fast forward
Like, Gone speed me up
Gotta deadline cuz you need me done
I hate your type
I love you too
I bite your swag cuz I wanna do you
Can you blame me babe?
Obama your work clothes
Girl make a change
Into your lingere right like that
lalala make your eyes roll back
I mean you already fine though
I just wanna see you with the lights off
Every guy wanna know
How it is to clap off the lights
and turn Khloe into Kim

-Chorus-
You're a dime (so beautiful)
Top of the line (so unushual)
Words can't define 
You're runnin through my mind all day (day, day)
I'm so happy you're mine (so beautiful)
Top of the line (so unushual)
Now I think it's time (hey shawty)
I hope you don't take this the wrong way
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off (ooh)
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off (ooh)
(better with the lights off)

Uh drive off take my girl to have a nice day
Shit was right, so I let her hang my way
You look cute girl, What you wanna do girl?
Drive to my house cuz it's only me and you girl
I'm checkin her out she had to put her swag on
acting too happy saying she ain't goin back home
Im like wow.. Whatever you say
But whatever you plan gotta be done at 8
Next stop, party at my place
Of course you welcome girl you ain't takin up space
We get there, and shawty still lookin right
She attacked me, but wait let me dim the lights
You look different, Shes like boy stop it
Nahh I ain't playin, actually you more poppin
She said shocking, no that really raw
I don't know but baby even witht he lights off

-Chorus-
You're a dime (so beautiful)
Top of the line (so unushual)
Words can't define 
You're runnin through my mind all day (day, day)
I'm so happy you're mine (so beautiful)
Top of the line (so unushual)
Now I think it's time (hey shawty)
I hope you don't take this the wrong way
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off (ooh)
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off (ooh)
(better with the lights off)
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off (ooh)
Girl you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off (ooh)
