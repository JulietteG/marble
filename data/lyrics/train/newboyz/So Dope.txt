[Intro:]
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so...

(You are so dope) Hey
(You are so dope) I know
(You are so dope) Ayyy, haha, I know
(You are so dope) New Boyz
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope

[Legacy:]
I must be, D-O-P-E by the way the girls react
When they see, me they screaming so loud that they voices crack
Just like that, she never met a jerk like I
Told me that she love it when I sport my tie
With a t-shirt on like that is so dope
Told her "Why you actin thirsty? Get back in yo' boat
Oh bitch, you weary, I'm readin
On this dope beat that ain't breathin
Murdered it, buried under yo' knees
If I clip that track like I cut a girl weave
Got my SB skinny jeans vest and a top hat
Fit so new Chris couldn't even rock that
Always askin how I get my wealth
Cause I'm dope and a dealer, I sell myself

You are so do... you are, you are so dope (I know)
You are so do... you are, you are so dope (I know)
You are so do... you are, you are so dope (I know)
You are so do... you are, you are so dope (Ayyy do me a favor, call me dope one more time)
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope

[Ben J:]
You already know what it is cause I already know
If you cute raise your hand... yup!
Ben, the thing about your steez is it's great!
Can't really argue like speech and debate
Grab a honey on the side get a drink and we shake
People say that they fresh so I keep a stale face
Like no, you know I got bars like soap
And you wonder why I celebrate the trees, cause I'm dope
Got my skinny jeans on fresh shirt matchin hat
Now you know how I get more head then a fitted cap
I'm heavy hittin get up in it in a minute I'ma get it
Flip it work it bring it back, now you know I'm really crack
I'ma stop it then I start to come back
Ben J, where you from? New Boyz, it's a wrap
Look bro, I don't chase no girls
And you wonder why they chase me? Cause My Name Is Earl
I date 4, 5 chicks and you know they all choke
And they told me "Lil' daddy, you so dope!"

You are so do... you are, you are so dope (I know)
You are so do... you are, you are so dope (I know)
You are so do... you are, you are so dope (I know)
You are so do... you are, you are so dope (Ayyy do me a favor, call me dope one more time)
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope

[Outro:]
This beat
This beat
This beat is on fire
We don't need no water we just let this function jerk
Jerk (jerk) jerk, we just let this function jerk
Jerk (jerk) jerk, we just let this function jerk
I'm dope

You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are so dope
You are so do... you are, you are SO DOPE!---Lyrics submitted by Anya.
