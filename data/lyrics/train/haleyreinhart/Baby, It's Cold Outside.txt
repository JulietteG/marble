I really cant stay
(baby, its cold outside)
Ive got to go away
(baby, its cold outside)

This evening has been
(Been hoping that youd drop in)
So very nice
(Ill hold your hands, theyre just like ice)

My mother will start to worry
(Beautiful, whats your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor
(Listen to the fireplace roar)

So really Id better scurry
(Beautiful, please dont hurry)
well maybe just a half a drink more
(Put some music on while I pour)

The neighbors might think
(Baby, its bad out there)
Say, whats in this drink?
(No cabs to be had out there)

I wish I knew how
(Your eyes are like starlight)
To break this spell
(Ill take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say no, no, no, sir
(Mind if I move a little closer?)
At least Im gonna say that I tried
(Whats the sense in hurting my pride?)

I really cant stay
(Baby, dont hold out)
Oh, but its cold outside

My sister will be suspicious
(Gosh, your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door
(Waves upon a tropical shore)

My maiden aunts mind is vicious
(Oh God, your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a half drink more
(Never such a blizzard before)

Ive got to go home
(But baby, youll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat
(Its up to your knees out there)

Youve really been grand
(I thrill when you touch my hand)
But dont you see
(How can you do this thing to me?)

Theres bound to be talk tomorrow
(Think of my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied
(If you caught pneumonia and died)

I really cant stay
(Get over that hold out)
Oh, but its cold outside---Lyrics submitted by niki.
