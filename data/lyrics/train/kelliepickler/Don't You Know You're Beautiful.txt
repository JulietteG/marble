Hey little girl with your tangled hair,
Your tattered clothes,
You're 15 and your about to bloom just like a rose.
You wishin' that you had designer jeans,
like the ones you see in magazines.
Now I know you'd give anything just to fit in,
but your worth aint on a price tag, it comes from within.

Dont you know youre beautiful?
Dont you know youre beautiful?
Dont you know youre beautiful?
Just the way you are!

Hey there little homecoming queen, in that backseat,
I'll bet his brown eyes are promising you everything,
and I know you wanna be just like your friends,
but he'll still love if you dont give in.
If those girls were being honest,theyve been where your at,
I'll bet they'll tell you they wish they had their innocence back.

Dont you know your beautiful?
Dont you know your beautiful?
Dont you know your beautiful?
Just the way you are!

So he left you for a girl that could be your twin,
if you were 28 again.
Let him go [let him go],
let him fly [let him fly],
keep your head up get on with your life.

Dont you know your beautiful?
Dont you know your beautiful?
Dont you know your beautiful?
Just the way you are!

Don't you know your beautiful?
Don't you know your beautiful?
Don't you know your beautiful?
Just the way you are!

Don't you know your beautiful?
Don't you know your beautiful?
Don't you know your beautiful?
[Just the way you are!]
Don't you know your beautiful?

Don't you know your beautiful?
Don't you know your beautiful?
Don't you know your beautiful?---Lyrics submitted by Hailey.
