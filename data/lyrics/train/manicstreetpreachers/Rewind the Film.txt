Rewind the film again
I'd love to see my joy, my friends
Rewind the film again
So I can fall asleep content

Rewind the film once more
Turn back the pages of my post
Rewind the film once more
I want the world to see it all

I want to feel small
Lying in my mother's arms
Playing my old records
Hoping that they never stop

There's too much heartbreak
In the nothing of the now
I want to see it all
Never want to let it go

Rewind the film once more
Turn back the pages of my post
Rewind the film once more
I want the world to see it all

Let me hide under the sheets
And celebrate the boredom
Let me hide under the sheets
With my brave old one

Rewind the film again
I'd love to see my joy, my friends
Rewind the film again
So I can fall asleep content

Rewind the film once more
Turn back the pages of my post
Rewind the film once more
I want the world to see it all

I want to feel small
Holding on my father's hands
Playing all the records
Praying that they'll never stop

There is too much heartbreak
In the nothing of the now
I want to see it all
Never going to let you down

Rewind the film once more
Turn back the pages of my post
Rewind the film once more
I want the world to see it all

I want the world to see all the love 
And security, my childhood dreams
But now I am my busket flesh
And I am waiting for the night to come

So rewind the film again
I'd love to see my joy, my friends
Yes, rewind the film again
So I can fall asleep content---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
