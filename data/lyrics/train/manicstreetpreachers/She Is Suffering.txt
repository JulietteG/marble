Beauty finds refuge in herself
Lovers wrapped inside each others lies
Beauty is such a terrible thing
She is suffering yet more than death

She is suffering
She sucks you deeper in
She is suffering
You exist within her shadow

Beauty she is scarred into man's soul
A flower attracting lust, vice and sin
A vine that can strangle life from a tree
Carrion, surrounding, picking on leaves

She is suffering
She sucks you deeper in
She is suffering
You exist within her shadow

Beauty she poisons unfaithful all
Stifled, her touch is leprous and pale
The less she gives the more you need her
No thoughts to forget when we were children

She is suffering
She sucks you deeper in
She is suffering
Nature's lukewarm pleasure---
