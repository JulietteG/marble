For you , I make sure I clear my schedule
This weekend was fully devoted to you
You said you were coming through real soon
That was now a couple hours ago
I'm thinking in my head; you really got nerve
This won't be the first time that you stood me up
Well baby I got news for you
It's time to get a taste of your own medicine
I'm throwing my best on
I'm letting my hair down
I'm not bout to spend the night alone , no
You just made my shit list
Baby you can kiss it

Tonight , tonight , tonight , tonight !

I'ma dance till the morning
I'm not waiting up for you
Boy , I'm turning off my phone tonight; [ night night night ]
By the time that you called
I'd be on talking in about you on the floor; [ floor floor ]
I'ma party with my beautiful people; [ people people ]
You beautiful people , people
I'ma party with my beautiful people; [ people people ]
You beautiful people , people
I'ma party with my beautiful people

I'ma make it known the second I arrive
For your sake , you better hope nobody catch my eye
Cause since you live it like you single !
I'ma do the same , I'ma do my thing yeah
When I hear my song , make the DJ turn it up
In the middle of the floor , I-I-I'ma burn it up
No longer will I be , worryin' about you .
You could find me in the night life you've gone

I'm throwing my best on
I'm letting my hair down
I'm not bout to spend the night alone, no
You just made my shit list
Baby you can kiss it

Tonight , tonight , tonight , tonight !

I'ma dance till the morning
I'm not waiting up for you
Boy , I'm turning off my phone tonight; [ night night night ]
By the time that you called
I'd be on forgettin' about you on the floor; [ floor floor ]
I'ma party with my beautiful people; [ people people ]
You beautiful people , people
I'ma party with my beautiful people; [ people people ]
You beautiful people , people
I'ma party with my beautiful people .

With my easy , breezy , beautiful cover girls !
If you man I'll treat you right; pay em back tonight
Easy , Breezy , Beautiful Cover Girls !
G-g-get a batch tonight; night night night night night night night night night night !
Off to the night ; night night night night night night 
Off to the night ; night night night night night night 
Off to the night ; night night night night night night 

This is for my easy . breezy , beautiful cover girls 
Easy , breezy , beautiful cover girls !

I'ma dance till the morning
I'm not waiting up for you
Boy , I'm turning off my phone tonight; I'm turning of my phone tonight
By the time that you called
I'd be on talking in about you on the floor; [ floor floor ]
I'ma party with my beautiful people; [ people people ]
You beautiful people , people
I'ma party with my beautiful people; [ people people ]
You beautiful people , people
