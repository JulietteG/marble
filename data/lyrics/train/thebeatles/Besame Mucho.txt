Cha-cha pum!
Besame, besame mucho,
Each time I bring you kiss, I hear music devine!
So besame,
Besame mucho,
I'll love you forever say that you'll always be mine.

Cha-cha pum!

Dearest one, if you should leave me, 
Then each little dream will take wings, and my life would be thru.
Oh! Besame, besame mucho,
Oooh love me forever make all my dreams come true.

Oooh this joy is something new, my arms are, folding you,
Never knew this, thrill before.
Who'd ever thought i'd be, holding you, close to me wispering it's you,
I adore.

Yeah, so dearest one, if you should leave me,
Then each little dream will take wings, and my life would be thru.
Oooh! So besame, besame mucho!
I'll love you forever make all my dreams come true.

Oooh this joy is something new, my arms are, folding you,
Never knew this, thrill before.
Who'd ever thought i'd be, holding you, close to me wispering it's you,
I adore.

Oh, so dearest one, if you should leave me,
Then each little dream will take wings, and my life would be thru.
Oooh! So besame, besame mucho!
[And i'll love you forever make all my dreams come true.] 3x---Lyrics submitted by corina.
