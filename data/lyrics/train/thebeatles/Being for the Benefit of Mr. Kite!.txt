For the benefit of Mister Kite,
There will be a show tonight on trampoline.
The Hendersons will all be there, late of Pablo Fanque's fair;
What a scene.
Over men and horses, hoops and garters,
Lastly through a hog'shead of real fire.
In this way Mister K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mister K.,
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate.
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mister Kite flies through the ring; don't be late.
Mess'rs K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course, Henry, The Horse, dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mister K. performs his tricks without a sound.
And Mister H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground.
Having been some days in preparation,
A splendid time is guaranteed for all.
And tonight Mister Kite is topping the bill.---
