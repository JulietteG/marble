Oh, I've been working a week, I'm tired
Yeah, I've been working a week and I'm
Just living for the weekend

Hey hey
Got some money I just got paid
Got some money and I can't wait
At six o'clock I'm out of here

Out there tonight
Is the night of my last got my name on
Run down my street adidas on my feet
I'm on fire

Working all the time
Work is such a bind
Got some money to spend
Living for the weekend
When it gets too much
I live for the rush
Got some money to spend
Living for the weekend

Oh man!
Yeah I've been working a week, I'm shot
Yeah I've been working a week for what?
Just living for the weekend
Ah shit!
So my clothes are all counterfeit
So my name isn't on the list
'No you can't come in, so go home boys!'

Slip round the back look at that
There's a crack toilet window
Drop to the floor covers us through the door
I'm on fire

Working all the time
Work is such a bind
Got some money to spend
Living for the weekend
When it gets too much
I live for the rush
Got some money to spend
Living for the weekend

Can you feel it?
Feel the pressure... rising
Pushing down on me, oh lord!

Pressure, pressure, pressure pressure pressure
Feel the pressure
Pressure, pressure, pressure pressure pressure

Living for the weekend [x8]

Going out tonight, going out tonight
Baby you and I are going out tonight
[repeat x4]---
