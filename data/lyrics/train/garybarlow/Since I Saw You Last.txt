They took my voice
Erased my past
With all that noise
It couldnt last
With words so cruel
I washed my face
Hoped one day
Id wake up in a better place

[Chorus]
Today I took back what was stolen
And gave new life to what was frozen
One mouth talking
A dead man walking
A thousand faces watched me falling
Ive made my peace with what may happen
Accepted I wont be in fashion
Oh you gave, I got it
Yeah you gave, I got it all back
Since I saw you last

When brothers land
And take whats good
You can win a war
Oh, and shed no blood
Everybody plays their part
Oh we let the haters hate
While everybodys losing heart
Lying in the longest grass I sit and wait

[Chorus]
Today I took back what was stolen
And gave new life to what was frozen
One mouth talking
A dead man walking
A thousand faces watched me falling
Ive made my peace with what may happen
Accepted I wont be in fashion
Oh you gave, I got it
Yeah you gave, I got it all back
Since I saw you last

I know you heard
My shout for help
For those who stood and watched
I know you heard my cry for help
I know you heard I was going through hell
I know you heard I was losing my mind
I know you heard it was a matter of time
I know you heard
I know you heard
I know you heard
I know you heard---
