Well I walked on down to Bourbon Street
 I'm looking for the house of New Orleans
 And I sold off all my whiskey
 I bummed a cigarette from a man who had no arms
 And I asked him for directions
 He just turned around and walked on down the road

(Chorus)
 Well I remember the night 
That we danced out in the rain
And I remember the night 
That she held me through my pain 
I know there's times I feel like I could go insane
 But I remember the night that we danced in the rain

I walked on down to the waters edge 
Watched the Mississippi river boats flying down that waterline
 And I watched couples walking in the sand and holding hands
 Well I got lost that night in the shadows of the damn
