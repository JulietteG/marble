I'm cruisin down Main Street in an '87 Chevrolet.
I'm rollin down 174 tryin to find some more.
I wish I had a little money I'd spend it all on you.
I'd buy us a quarter bag and a twelve pack of brew.

[Chorus]
And w'ell get high, and I drink.
While I'm tryin not to think.
And I get stoned and I'm drunk.
While I'm tryin to change my luck.
Just gettin by......
Well I'm-a-gettin by, gettin high, yeah.
[End Chorus]

Walkin down Browns Mountain tryin to find my way around.
I hope I don't get stopped by the cops in this here town.
We head on to the south side and the cemetary trails.
A worn out fishin hole where I raised a lot of hell.

[Chorus]
And I get high, and I drink.
While I'm tryin not to think.
And I get stoned and I'm drunk.
While I'm tryin to change my luck.
Just gettin by......
Well I'm-a-gettin by, gettin high, yeah.
[End Chorus]

There's a girl that lives on my street.
Strawberry blonde, she tastes so sweet.
I wanna tell her all the words in my heart.
She moved away then she tore my world apart.

[Chorus]
And I get high, and I drink.
While I'm tryin not to think. 
And I get stoned and I'm drunk.
While I'm tryin to change my luck.
Just gettin by.......
Well I'm-a-gettin by, gettin high, yeah.
[End Chorus]

Fifteen minutes south of the Fort Worth city lights.
We watch football games here on Friday nights.
I grew up slow and now I'm livin so fast.
Runnin out of liquor and this quater bag won't last.

[Chorus]
Cause I get high, and I drink.
While I'm tryin not to think.
And I get stoned and I'm drunk.
While I'm tryin to change my luck.
Just gettin by......
Well I'm-a-gettin by, gettin high, yeah.
[End Chorus]

[Chorus]
And I get high, and I drink.
While I'm tryin not to think.
And I get stoned and I'm drunk.
While I'm tryin to change my luck.
Just gettin by......
Well I'm-a-gettin by, gettin high, yeah...
