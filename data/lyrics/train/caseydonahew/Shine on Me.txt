The sands of time they flow so slow
I catch hell from everyone I know
And Im so tired of being alone
So I get drunk and I just stay home

Looking in the mirror I get lost
I think about lifes choices and the cost
I wish I could stop and catch my air
And whoever said that life is fair

[Chorus]
Now its been a long 25 years
Living life with all these fears
Im holding on for a better day
Pray the sun will come and stay
Shine on me, shine on me

Life so hard, Im so confused
Broken down, my souls been used
And I know there wont be an excuse
But sometimes you got to cut the pain loose

[Chorus]

I know you wont understand
All I can do is all I can
Im so weak when I need to be strong
And it wont be long until you find me gone

Now its been a long 25 years
Living life with all these fears
Im holding on for a better day
Pray the sun will come and stay
Shine on me, shine on me

Just shine on me (shine on me) [4x]---Lyrics submitted by Brad Graham.
