Straight out of her wildest dreams
No belt buckles and start jean
Dirty Stetson hat, spurs on his feet
He gets bucked off but he gets back up
Knows that it hurts but he's too tough
He's showing that's what brings her to her knees

She's a cowboy girl
She loves to watch him ride
The silhouette against the sky
Of the deepest cobalt blue
A cowboy girl
He'll stay with her for awhile
She can't resist his crooked smile
He's a sinner of her world
She's a cowboy girl

But she don't try to take
That part of him away
To rope him in is like trying to fence the wind

She's a cowboy girl
She loves to watch him ride
The silhouette against the sky
Of the deepest cobalt blue
A cowboy girl
He'll stay with her for awhile
She can't resist his crooked smile
He's a sinner of her world
She's a cowboy girl---
