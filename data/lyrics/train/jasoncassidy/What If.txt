You say
You've heard this all before
And you can't
Take lies anymore
But baby 
Before you walk out the door
I won't make you cry 
Make you cry any more

Chorus:
But if I'm right 
What if I'm really going to love you all my life
What if a brand new me is standing here tonight
Would you take my hand
Give me one more chance

What if you're wrong
Baby this ain't the same old sad love song
And i just want to hold you all night long
Oh baby!!
What if I'm right, and you're wrong?

My jealousy's no longer
This time I'm much stronger 
Than the man i used to be
Don't turn your back on me
Well i just want to kiss your face
I swear i changed my ways
Oh baby please please stay

Chorus:
But if I'm right 
What if I'm really going to love you all my life
What if a brand new me is standing here tonight
Would you take my hand
Give me one more chance

What if you're wrong
Baby this ain't the same old sad love song
And i just want to hold you all night long
Oh baby!!
What if I'm right, and you're wrong?

Oh baby please be wrong---Lyrics submitted by Tony Woodard.
