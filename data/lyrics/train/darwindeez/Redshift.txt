Spiral galaxies would turn in your eyes
when I came by with a small surprise
you loved all of my little quirks, so what went wrong?
don't try to super string me along 

Was there a big bang that I just missed?
Dis some explosion cause a redshift?
'Cause you're moving away from me but what did I do?
The universe is mostly empty space without you.

Wave or particle, I cant be both
so just say which way you like me most
I can be an experiment in your bedroom lab
to figure out how the light we had went bad

Was there a big bang that I just missed?
Did some explosion cause a redshift?
'Cause you're moving away from me but what did I do?
The universe is mostly empty space without you

I'll build a collider and smash us to bits
to see what's inside us, to see if we hit
'cause I will try anything this side of the the Milky Way
to figure out why in the world you're drifting away

Was there a big bang that i just missed?
Did some explosion cause a redshift?
'Cause you're moving away from me but what did I do?
The universe is mostly empty space with out you.---Lyrics submitted by Gi Rodriguez.
