So this is how it ends
this is where it all goes down
this is what I don't love you feels like

it ain't the middle of the night
and it ain't even raining outside
it ain't exactly what I had in mind
for goodbye

at a red light in the sunshine
on a Sunday nothing to say
don't even try

Some are coming home
Some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine at a red light

I thought she was gonna say
something 'bout that couple kids crossing the street
something about this beautiful day

She just looked me in the eye
said it's over
didn't try to lie or pick a fight
might of seen it coming that way

At a red light in the sunshine
on a Sunday nothing to say
don't even try

some are coming home
some are leavin town
while my world's crashing down
on a Sunday in the sunshine at a red light

There's a mama calming down a little baby
in the back seat in front of me
There's an old man dressed in his Sunday best
just waiting on green
but I can't see getting past.....

This red light in the sunshine
on a Sunday nothing to say
don't even try

Some are coming home
Some are leaving town
while my world's crashing down
on a Sunday in the sunshine at a red light

at a red light in the sunshine
on a Sunday nothing to say
don't even try

Some are coming home
Some are leaving town
while my world's crashing down
on a Sunday in the sunshine at a red light

at a red light
at a red light
at a red light---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
