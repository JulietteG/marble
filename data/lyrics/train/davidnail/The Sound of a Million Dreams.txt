Seger was singing words I could believe in
And "Main Street" was my street that night
So I called up Samantha and asked her the
chance of us
Running out 'neath the moonlight
Well, She's not with me now, she can always
be found
When I rewind the radio dial
And like it was then I feel her on my skin
And I'm back there for awhile

Chorus:
So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power
Of a song when a song hits you right
Pouring my soul into stories of life
Hoping someone'll hear one tonight
Maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys
Comes the sound, the sound of a million dreams

My 18th summer I was a cocky up-and-comer
Cranking up "Born To Run"
Turned left out the drive with the pistons open wide
And I came back a Prodigal son
My spirit was broken, she threw the door open
I love you not, I told you so
When I hear, "Mama Tried," I still break down and cry
And pull to the side of the road

(Repeat chorus twice)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
