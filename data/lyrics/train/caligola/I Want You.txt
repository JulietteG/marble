I want you,cause you make me feel free 
You're make me high, oh baby (x2)

Heaven is ... the moment you all've been waiting for
That's what you told me in the basement, where we first met and shed a tear
You said you are so nasty, I wanna feel you and we will dare to do things that you did say
So I'm on my aim now, let's melt together, in a symphony of guilty pleasures

I want you,cause you make me feel free 
You're make me high, oh baby (x2)

Are you ready for my treatment, I've got all the fire you ever dreamed of
Now all your fears and your problems, gonna kill them,when we meet at the gates
And when you are with me I feel so secured and my demons they all fly away
So won't you see, girl untill the dawn we'll be dancing to the doom drums tonight

I want you,cause you make me feel free 
You're make me high, oh baby (x3)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
