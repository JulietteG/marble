Do you believe in happy endings?
Or the mendings of human hearts?
Oh, I believe in both, I'm certain.
Because these curtains are state of the art

If you'd occasionally happen to spy on me
You'd think I'm having one sided coversations
But I hear him talking back
You'd think I may even lack some sanity
But maybe I cant let go

(Chorus)
So I'll say I finally wrote your song at last
Sorry that this one came out so sad
Every tear I had was shed for the man that gave me a better sence
Of life and meaning to motivate
There's no shortcut to success
I'll wait fit his guiding hands
My guardian angel until the very end

I see a cold seat on the couch
Where I remember that just four years ago around December
You sat me down and held me next to you so close
How I longed for things to be restored
To back when times weren't quite this hard
In the car, that song you sang to me
Never rang so loud before

Oh, what I'd give for just another hug from you
You may be gone, but love will never die

(Repeat chorus)

Tears cant run dry when I start to cry
When I hear people speak of how you'd be so proud of me
And now I hope this song will reach your ears
That solved all my darkest fears
I once was blind, but now it's clears
Wherever I go, I know you'll be near

(Repeat chorus)
My guardian angel until the very end---Lyrics submitted by Hailey.
