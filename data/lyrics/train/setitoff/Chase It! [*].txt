Shut your mouth 'cause your never quiet.
You put it out when I tried to light it.
This is a race that I will not lose,
i'll chase it 'till my legs give out! (woo!)

[instrumental :3]

What is it that you want from me?
To become what you would be,
but I would rather take my chances,
at running like wind to make advantage.
But until then,
shut your mouth 'cause your never quiet.
You put it out when I tried to light it.
This is a race that I will not lose,
i'll chase it 'till my legs give out!

When I do what I love, 
I find myself looking back again,
as I wait for you all,
to judge my every,
move that I make.
You'd love to watch me fall down again.
I come to know that,
you'll never support this.

Go ahead and cast your little,
judgmental glaces,
i'm not defenseless!
Stop aloud, and flaunt your oh-so pompous stature.
I am where perception plays an important role in how you control them.
I'm not going to waste my breath on giving up to who you want me to be!

Shut your mouth 'cause your never quiet.
You put it out when I tried to light it.
This is a race that I will not lose,
I'll chase it 'till my legs give out!

When I do what I love, 
I find myself looking back again,
as I wait for you all,
to judge my every,
move that I make.
You'd love to watch me fall down again.
I come to know that,
you'll never support this.

It's what I want, when no body had my back.
It's what I need, when I'm feeling all alone.
This is what I want,
to know of myself,
and know that no one else will break me down. 

It's what I want, when no body had my back.
It's what I need, when I'm feeling all alone.
This is what I want,
to know of myself,
and know that no one else will break me down. 

It's what I want, when no body had my back.
It's what I need, when I'm feeling all alone.
This is what I want,
to know of myself,
and know that no one else will break me down. 

When I do what I love, 
I find myself looking back again,
as I wait for you all,
to judge my every,
move that I make.
You'd love to watch me fall down again.
I come to know that,
you'll never support this.---Lyrics submitted by Jessi Valentine.
