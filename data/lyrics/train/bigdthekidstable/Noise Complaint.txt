Sixty feet stomping (Noise Complaint!)
Yeah the souped-up vinyl spinning (Noise Complaint!)
Well laughing is a reason (Noise Complaint!)
We're all spaz cap drinking (Noise Complaint!)

Well it's a sure shot, we can't be stopped
Twenty bucks says there's a noise complaint

Tearing down the curtains (Noise Complaint!)
We're just blowing out the speakers (Noise Complaint!)
You know the neighbors pound the floorboards (Noise Complaint!)
Yeah, this party ain't no secret (Noise Complaint!)

Well it's a sure shot, we can't be stopped
Yeah alright yeah there's a noise complaint, Oi!

Alley dog howling (Noise Complaint!)
We're all lighting up the tilt sign (Noise Complaint!)
It's just mad street rocking (Noise Complaint!)
Did you see those little skirts flipping (Noise Complaint!)

Well it's a sure shot, we can't be stopped
We're a crazy infestation of the truly un-cool

Ha ha ha crazy man

Police rack the front door (Noise Complaint!)
Then all them girls hit the closet (Noise Complaint!)
You know I'm underneath the bed now (Noise Complaint!)
It's just a chance for naughty smooching (Noise Complaint!)

Well it's a sure shot, we can't be stopped
We're sorry officer 'bout the noise complaint

Frigging in the rigging (Noise Complaint!)
Yeah there's smoggin' in my noggin' (Noise Complaint!)
We're all playing back seat bingo (Noise Complaint!)
Are you hip to my lingo (Noise Complaint!)

Well it's a sure shot, we can't be stopped
Back it up kid there's a noise complaint, Oi!

Noise Complaint!
Noise Complaint!
Noise Complaint!
Noise Complaint!

Okay, best two kids in the world!
Yes, that's very nice, yes

The record needle's dulling (Noise Complaint!)
All the ivy leaguers screaming (Noise Complaint!)
We're all posing for a picture (Noise Complaint!)
And just flip, dip, spinning (Noise Complaint!)

Well it's a sure shot, we can't be stopped
They play my favorite song it goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shy girls winking (Noise Complaint!)
And the good girls kissing (Noise Complaint!)
You see those rude girls spitting (Noise Complaint!)
And all them doped up dolls giggling (Noise Complaint!)

Well it's a sure shot, we can't be stopped
I like your neighbor, but your neighbor don't like me---Lyrics submitted by Jon.
