[On drugs]

Oh yeah!!!

Whoa, no!!!

She passed out at my parent's dinner,
[Uh-oh!]
You gotta love her!
She screamed at my dad that I'm a winner,
[He's a winner!]
She really digs me!
Scared the house might fall on us,
[What the hell...?]
While we're sleeping.
She's scared that we are going nuts,
That's what I'm thinking.

Whoa, yeah.
Whoa, whoa yeah.

CHORUS
She takes pot to come down, yeah,
Coke for the confidence,
All kinds of pills, 
If she had the money she would get 'em.
Huffing for a challenge,
Acid for the love of it,
And and and and and drinking just for fun!
My girlfriend's on drugs!!! [repeat 3x]
Her brain is going going going going gone
Aw yeah!

She swears the cat is stealing her money, 
[I know it's him.]
You gotta love her.
Whe she sees a cop she'll burst out laughing,
She's going crazy.
When I put her to bed she says thank you superman,
[Thank you superman...]
And I think I like it!
She showed up at my work on something,
And she screamed "I'm a daisy!"

CHORUS [3x]---Lyrics submitted by Ariel.
