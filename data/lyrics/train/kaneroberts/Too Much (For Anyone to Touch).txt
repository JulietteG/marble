Do you see that girl with the look in her eyes?
Don't even bother if she comes this way.
Let her walk on by.
Well, it's plain to see what's on your mind.
But don't get too close 'cause I know you'll find.

She's just a little bit,
Too much for anyone to touch.
I never saw a body move like that.
Too much for anyone to touch.
She's running wild and she's never lookin' back.

It's the flames of passion that  can drive you wild.
She can start the fire with just the trace of a smile.
Every move she makes in paradise.
But she's a raging fire and she's cold as ice.

She's just a little bit,
Too much for anyone to touch.
I never saw a body move like that.
Too much for anyone to touch.
She's running wild and she's never lookin' back.

I got the soul, I got the hart.
The heat of passion's tearing me apart.
I wanna show her what real love is like.
Gonna make it alright.

Every move she makes is paradise.
But she's a raging fire and she's cold as ice.

She's just a little bit,
Too much for anyone to touch.
I never saw a body move like that.
Too much for anyone to touch.
She's running wild and she's never lookin' back.---Lyrics submitted by Ken.
