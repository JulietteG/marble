you should see the letter i got today /
it came up from the blue-eyed gray / 
tragedy begins at home, or so i'm told /
tragedy begins at home , or so i'm told /

i can see your arm is decorated /
showing to me how long you've waited /
tragedy begins at home, or so i'm told /
tragedy begins at home, or so i'm told /

come on and sit close to where i am / 
see if we can make a smaller land /
tragedy begins at home, or so i'm told /
tragedy begins at home, or so i'm told /
tragedy begins at home, or so i'm told /
tragedy begins at home, or so i'm told /---Lyrics submitted by Elias Mason.
