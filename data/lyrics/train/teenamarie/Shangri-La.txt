Orange marmalade-Chocolate coated candy kisses
When my castle smiles-My heart beats and then it misses
Can I break it down in your corner love will find you
Love will blind you-So take me with you baby
Satisfaction and plenty of good times for you only
Don't be lonely-I'm gonna take you lover

Down by the sea where the sand meets the Shangri-La
We can make some more, pretty memories
Under the stars where I'll beg you for your Shangri-La
And your Milky Way is so heavenly

Heaven here on earth for my fortune it implores you
Never set me free-Simply said Ooo I adore you
Ice cream sandwhiches-Cherry hugs you hold me so close
Sipping Beaujolais-To your love I make the first toast
Can I break it down in your corner love will find you
Love will blind you- So take me with you baby
Satisfaction and plenty of good times for you only
Don't be lonely I'm gonna take you lover

Down by the sea where the sand meets the Shangri-La
We can make some more pretty memories
Under the stars where I'll beg you for your Shangri-La
And your Mikly Way is so heavenly

Turn yourself around-Won't you let me love you down
Where the galaxy caresses you
It could be fun and when it's done
You'll say the words I want to hear

Keep on get off lover-Lover-Lover-Shangri-La
we can make some more pretty memories
Under the stars-Baby-Shangri-La---Lyrics submitted by Tationna.
