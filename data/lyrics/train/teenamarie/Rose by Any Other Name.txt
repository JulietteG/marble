Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Gerald
Just this morning I took a stroll through your garden
I watched the sunrise and it made me think of you
The way you talk to the flowers and make them grow
And in the middle of all these flowers
There's one single stem red rose
It stood out from the rest the fairest of them all
It made me think of what you asked me
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Lady your body moves like poetry
Like a diamond in the raw
You shine for me
No one else can hold her hand up to you girl
Cause you're everything I need in my world lady

Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you call a rose by any other name
Here inside your garden it's like I feel unchanged
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Gerald
Take your time

Teena
In there, I got a song for you boy
Telling the world about the joy inside my garden
In the shade baby
Cause my world was spinning round
Until you made my love come down never gonna let you go
No, I never gonna let you go

Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you call a rose by any other name
Here inside your garden it's like I feel unchanged
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Anything you want

[G:] Anything you want
[T:] Anything you want

Can you call a rose by any other name?

Say
There's one thing [3x]
A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose
There's no other flower in my heart that grows
[G:] A rose is a rose
[T:] A rose is a rose
[G:] My flower
[T:] My rose, my flower
[G:] Growing, growing, growing, baby
[T:] Yes you are---Lyrics submitted by Darlene.
