And now the end is near;
and so I face the final curtain. ha ha ha ha
My friend, I'll make it clear;
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
I've lived a life that's full; 
traveled each and every highway.
And yet, much more than this,
I did it my way.

Regrets I've had a few;
but then again, too few to mention.
I did what I had to do
and saw it through without exemption.
I planned each charted course;
each giant step along the highway.
and more, much more than this,
I did it my way!

Yes! There were times, 
I'm sure you knew,
I shot up;
more than I could do!
and through it all;
there was no doubt!
I shot it up!
and spit it out!
I did it all;
and through it all'
I did it my way!---Lyrics submitted by Timi.
