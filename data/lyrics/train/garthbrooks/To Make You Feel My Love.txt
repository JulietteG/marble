When the rains blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

The evening shadows and the stars appear
There is no one to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've know it from the moment that we met
There's no doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storm's are raging on a rolling sea
Down the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
But you ain't seen nothing like me yet

There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the end's of the earth for you
Make you happy, make your dreams come true
To make you feel my,, love---Lyrics submitted by Susan.
