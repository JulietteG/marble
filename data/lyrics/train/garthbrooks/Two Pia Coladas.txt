was feelin' the blues
I was watching the news
When this fella
Came on the TV
He said I'm tellin' you
That science has proven
That heartaches are
Healed by the sea

That got me goin'
Without even knowin'
I packed right up
And drove down

Now I'm on a roll
And I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna
Paint this town

So bring me two pina coladas
One for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
And never leave dry land

Troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two pina coladas
She said good-bye to
Her good timin' man

Oh now I've gotta say
That the wind and the waves
And the moon
Winkin' down at me

Eases my mind
By leavin' behind
The heartaches that
Love often brings

Now I've got a smile
That goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam

I've gotta say
That I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more
And more like home

So bring me two pina coladas
One for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
And never leave dry land

Hey troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two pina coladas
She said good-bye to
Her good timin' man---Lyrics submitted by sherri.
