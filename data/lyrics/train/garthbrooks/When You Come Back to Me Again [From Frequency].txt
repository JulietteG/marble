There's a ship out on the ocean at the mercy of the sea.
It's been tossed about, lost and broken wandering aimlessly
And God somehow you know that ship is me
Cause there's a lighthouse, in a harbor shining faithfully,
pouring its life out across the water,
for this sinking soul in the sea,
That someone out there still believes in me.

On a prayer, in a song, I hear your voice,
and it keeps me hanging on.
Ahhhh, raining down, against the wind,
I'm reaching out, till we reach the circles end, 
when you come back to me again.

There's a moment, we all come to,
in our own time, in our own space,
where all that we've done, 
we can undo if our heart's in the right place.

On a prayer, in a song, 
I hear your voice, and it keeps me hanging on,
Ahhhh, raining down, against the wind
I'm reaching out, till we reach the circles end,
when you come back to me again and again
I see my yesterdays in front of me,
unfolding like a mystery,
you're changing all that is and used to be.

On a prayer, in a song,
I hear your voice, and it keeps me hanging on,
Ahhhh, raining down, against the wind,
I'm reaching out, till we reach the circles end,
when you come back to me again.
When you come back to me again.---Lyrics submitted by Cleola.
