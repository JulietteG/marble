Used again
Its not easy to site and pretend
When I'm alone in this
i don't know why but I'm still not over it

I looked in your eyes
Thought I felt something
I've never felt
I've never known

Don't know why i cant sleep
When you're not next to me
Left your clothes on the floor 
And your heart on my pillow
I don't want what you left
What you've taken from me
When its over
Its over
You left your heart on my pillow 
No!

Well you thought
that you could bring me in and tell me all your lies
Should've known 
That it was just enough to draw me in tonight

I looked in your eyes
Thought i felt something
I've never felt
I've never known

Don't know why I cant sleep
When you're not next to me
Left your clothes on the floor 
And your heart on my pillow
I don't want what you left
What you've taken from me
When its over
Its over
You left your heart on my pillow 
No!

I'm glad I'm not the only one
Who's ever had to feel
Like I'm half of what I want
When only half of you is real
And I 
Just wanted to love someone
And I
Just wanted to trust someone

I know I cant sleep
When you're not next to me
Left your clothes on the floor 
And your heart on my pillow
I don't want what you left
What you've taken from me
When its over
Its over
You left your heart on my pillow---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine Osborne.
