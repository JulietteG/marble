Aut vincere, aut vari.

Falling down.
Everything around me seems so fake:
Where should I land?
And time, your time,
Was nothing but a lie.
And my life was the plan.

[chorus]
What did I dream?
I do not know.
Yet strange my mind was tickled so,
I cannot help but laugh.
Did I dream?
I do not know.
Yet strange my mind was tickled so,
I cannot help but laugh.

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
(And we all fall down.)

Knock knock!
Whos there?
The pig flew up in the air.
The man in brown soon brought him down,
But nobody seemed to care.
Wishes and dreams, like fairytales,
Are never more than they seem.
Sugar and spice,
And everything nice.

La la la la la

[chorus]

There once was a girl who wandered
Among the path of darkness.
She had gone astray of the lighted way,
And a rose had bloomed of Sanity.
She came across a building which lured her
Inside to eat of its bread,
To drink its wine, oh so divine,
As another died of Chastise.

[chorus] 2x

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
