Summertime
It may be my favorite time
Better than any other time
If I'm with you
Wintertime
Is not at all my favorite time
But that could change at any time
If I'm with you
Autumn has proven lonely
Spring makes you feel brand new

I'll brave them all if only
I get to be with you
Any time
Will surely be my favorite time
Just like every other time
When I'm with you---
