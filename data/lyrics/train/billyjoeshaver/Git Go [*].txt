Its been that way since the git go, 
Its been that way since the git go
Its been that way since the git go, 
Lord its always been that way 

Woman shined the apple, and the man had to take a bite
Anything that good, God knows, just had to be right
Well they woke up naked with a bit headache, 
He been done in by a slippery snake, 
a man and a woman get to live a while and then they die

Its been that way since the git go, 
Its been that way since the git go
Its been that way since the git go, 
Lord its always been that way 

Politicians make promises that they cant keep
They keep printin money till they get in way too deep
Its the same old lesson, they never learn,
Theyre too busy workin on their next term
Politicians keep makin fools out of you and me

Its been that w\ay since the git go, 
Its been that w\ay since the git go
Its been that way since the git go, 
Lord its always been that way 

Money breeds war, as long as theres a man alive
Rich kids go to college, and the poor kids fight
High-rollers crap out evry time, roll a soldiers bones like loaded dice
War is the beast that makes evry mother cry

Its been that way since the git go, 
Its been that way since the git go
Its been that way since the git go, 
Lord its always been that way 

He told the truth, and they hung him up to die
The son of God who created you and I
He said it in the Good Book and letters in red
But we keep on forgettin evry thing He said
Jesus Christ hung on the cross for you and I

Its been that way since the git go, 
Its been that way since the git go
Its been that way since the git go, 
Lord its always been that way 

Its been that way since the git go, 
Its been that way since the git go
Its been that way since the git go, 
Lord its always been that way---Lyrics submitted by JOHN m taft.
