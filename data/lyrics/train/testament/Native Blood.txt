Whenever I stumble, whenever I fall
Whenever I'm pushed against the wall
This white man's world won't tell me what to do ...

Nowhere to run, my native blood
I wanna reach and touch the sun
Blistering my soul but I can't feel

You hear me say, get out of my way
I'll do it my own way
Cross my path and get what you deserve

I'm warning this world
To stay out of my way
My voice will be heard
I'm alone ...

I won't be afraid
I got something to say
My voice will be heard
SO LOUD!
Native Blood!

Forever proud, so goddamn loud
It's me alone against the crowd
Right or wrong it's the road that I must choose ...

There's no excuse, ATTITUDE!
Got something here that I must prove
Live to win instead of born to lose

I'm warning this world
To stay out of my way
My voice will be heard
So strong ...

I won't be afraid
I got something to say
My voice will be heard
SO LOUD!
Native Blood!

I learned to walk before I could crawl
Whenever pushed, I push back
Not afraid to throw the first punch
I'm never wrong cause I'm always right
And when I'm wrong I won't admit it
I'm the person your mother warned you about
They broke the mold after I came out
What gives me strength is my beliefs ...

Whenever I stumble, whenever I fall
Whenever I'm pushed against the wall
This white man's world won't tell me what to do ...

Nowhere to run, my native blood
I wanna reach and touch the sun
Blistering my soul but I can't feel

I'm warning this world
To stay out of my way
My voice will be heard
I'm alone ...

I won't be afraid
I got something to say
My voice will be heard
SO LOUD!
Native Blood!

I'm warning this world
To stay out of my way
My voice will be heard
So strong ...
I won't be afraid
I got something to say
My voice will be heard
SO LOUD!
Native Blood!
MY NATIVE BLOOD! ---Lyrics submitted by rockninjazsm.
