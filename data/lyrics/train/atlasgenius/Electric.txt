From the corner of your eye
Down to the trap you set tonight
To give you nothing's what you need
They give you so much you can't breathe

I know the past is a lonely place
And given time you could find what you couldn't replace
Don't pretend like you're up in a tree
The future's not where it used to be

It's so electric if we're pretending to
Act like we don't know what to do
To understand it, of where it's headed to
Like we don't know what to do

We could fall
Or we could just face it
And the times will go
We could fall

As I defend and you deny
I can't tell what you like
It's just the thoughts or so it seemed
Let's go outside so we can breathe

I know the past is a lonely place
And now you wake in a bed where there's no other face
Don't pretend like you're up in a tree
The future's not where it used to be

It's so electric if we're pretending to
Act like we don't know what to do
To understand it, of where it's headed to
Like we don't know what to do

We could fall
Or we could just face it
And the times will go
We could fall---Lyrics submitted by David Doorn.
