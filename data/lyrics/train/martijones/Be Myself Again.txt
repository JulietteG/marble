Heres a kid
Got the best of me
Had a mess around.

Heres a kiss
Supposed to set me free
I got messed around.

Finger on my porch??
Finger on the trigger
Fighting for the time to 
Make it through the maze

Racing was my heart
Squeezing on the trigger
Looking for the quick escape

I was lost and
The world was cold.
I was spread around

He was hot (?) and assumed control
I was led around

Wasted all my time
Wasted all my money
Chasing after love that never had a chance

Cheated out of time
Cheated out money
Cheated out of self-respect

Chorus:
And I need to be reborn
Yeah, you need to take me home
Take me home where I can be myself again

Hey you
Made me lose control
I got knocked around

It was time 
To collect my soul
When you came around

Never ??
Sharing all my sorrows
Saying all the things I ever needed to hear

Giving me your love
??
Give your body to be near---Lyrics submitted by maggie.
