My world it moves so fast today
The past it seems so far away
And life squeezes, so tightly that I can't breathe

And every time I've tried to be
What someone else thought of me
So caught up I wasn't able to achieve

But deep in my heart
The answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind
To define my own destiny
Oh no

I, I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be?

I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that his strength is within me

And deep in my heart
The answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind
To define my own destiny
And deep in my heart
No no no

And deep in my heart
The answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind
To define my own destiny---
