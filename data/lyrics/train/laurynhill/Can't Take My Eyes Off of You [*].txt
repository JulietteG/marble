You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.
You'd be like heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived.
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.

Pardon the way that I stare.
There's nothing else to compare.
The sight of you leaves me weak.
There are no words left to speak.
But if you feel like I feel.
Please let me know that it's real.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.

I need you baby, if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.
I love you baby.
Trust in me when I say, "OK." (it's OK)
Oh pretty baby, "Don't let me down," I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby...
