yo (hahahah)
It's like(you know)
Sweet sweet 
sweet (tell him)
EEEM

let me be patient 
let me be kind 
make me unselfish
with out being blind

though I may suffer
i'll envy it not 
and endure
what comes cuz
he's all that I got

(Chorus)
Tell him (tell him I need him)
Tell him I love him (And it will be all  right)
Tell.... Him... be all right .. be All right

(Repeat)

Now I may have faith
to make moutains fall
but if i lack love 
then i  am nothing at all

I can give away 
every thing that I possess
 but am with out love
 then I have no happiness

I know I'm imperfect
and not with out sin
but now that i'm older
 all childish things end

(Chorus)

I'll never be jealous 
And i'll won't be to proud
Cuz love is no boastsful 
 oh and love is not loud

Tell him i need him
tell him i love him tell him 
everything,
and everything will be alright

Oh oh ohh yeah yaeh all yeah

Now i may have wisdom
and knowledge on earth
but if i speak wrong
 oh then what is it worth

See what we now know
is nothing compared 
to the love that was shown 
when our lives were spared
