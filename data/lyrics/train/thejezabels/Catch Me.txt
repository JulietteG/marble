Four to the floor
Was the answer
Me on my knees
Like a dancer
Heartbreaker, you match me

You see the minds on the air
Call him mister vain
Fever, catch me

Four to the floor
In the state of the art
Our feet come down in pattern

And do you feel the rage?
I'm so glad you came
Oh, feelings are natural

When you're flying low over cities of love
Over cities of dreams, yeah
When you're watching the waves in country towns

That are amazing
When you get in the vibe
When you're moving inside
When you know what I mean, yeah
When you getting the vibe
When you're moving inside

And oh let it go
Be without you
And oh let it go
Be without you
And oh let it go
So glad you came
And oh let it go
Just feel the dreams

Catch me

And in the cities that I love...
And in the towns that I love...
Up on a pattern to the floor

And, oh, let it go
What you know
What they say
Fall in love with the world over again
Eating alone and in tribes tastes amazing
Eating alone, watch it grow---Lyrics submitted by Jack Hackett.
