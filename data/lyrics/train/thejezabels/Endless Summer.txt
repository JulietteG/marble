And in the morning I'll be waiting,
For your never-ending wave,
For our passage to arise,
How can I explain it?
Yeah.

You came home for the endless summer,
On the white, saw a different color,
In the streets, you got a secret to repeat,
In my mind, you're the ephemeral kind.

Never too late to be touched by,
The feasting tendrils of the night,
Now left to ponder your devotions,
Now left imagining a time.

You came home for the endless summer,
Watch me go paint a famous warrior,
Of the light, you were the strongest follower,
In my mind  you are an endless summer!
An endless summer in my mind,
An endless summer in my mind,
An endless summer in my mind.

Yeah, I get low and black witches hold my hand,
Yeah, I get low, feel no one understands,
Now mistakes, make mantelpieces bend,
Now, black cinders, black cinder til the end.

You came home for the endless summer,
Watch me go, paint a different color,
Of my life, you were the deepest lover,
Stay with me, here in the endless summer!
An endless summer in my mind.
An endless summer in my mind.
An endless summer in my mind.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
