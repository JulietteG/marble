Booty Ooty
Incredible, unforgettable to watch you shake your booty ooty to the ground
Its awful nice. Its Paradise
Why do you get up, while they get down
Everybody says you are cutie when you shake your booty ooty to the ground
Everybody says you are cutie  when you shake your booty ooty to the ground

When you shake it to the foxtrot ; when you shake it to the foxtrot  
When you shake it to the foxtrot ; when you shake it to the foxtrot  

People drive from miles around to see you shake your booty ooty to the ground
People drive from miles around to see you shake your booty ooty to the ground
Get down! Watch you by yourself; Get down! Watch you by yourself;
Get down! Watch you by yourself; Get down! Watch you by yourself

I like to see you shake your booty, shake your booty ooty to the ground
I like to see you shake your booty, shake your booty ooty to the ground
Oops! Excuse me you couldnt get it, Oops! Excuse me you couldnt get it
Oops! Excuse me you couldnt get it


Do the thing, Do the thing, Do the dirty what a booty kind a thing
Do the thing, Do the thing, Do the dirty what a booty kind a thing

Incredible, unforgettable to watch you shake your booty ooty to the ground
Its awful  nice. Its Paradise
Why do you to get up, why do you get down
Everybody says you are cutie when you shake your booty ooty to the ground 
Everybody says you are cutie when you shake your booty ooty to the ground
Get down! Watch you by yourself; Get down! Watch you by yourself;
Get down! Watch you by yourself; Get down! Watch you by yourself---Lyrics submitted by Freddy.
