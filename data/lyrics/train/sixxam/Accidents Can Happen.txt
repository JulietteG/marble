Don't give up, It takes Awhile. I have seen this look before
And it's alright, Your not alone, If you don't love this anymore.
I hear that you slipped again,
Im here cause I know you need a friend.

(Chorus)
And you know that accidents can happen 
and it's okay, we all fall off the wagon sometimes, 
It's not your whole Life, 
It's only one day, you haven't thrown everything away.

Take some time,
Learn to breathe, And remember what it means,
to feel alive and to believe. Somethin' more than what you see. 
I know there's a price for this. 
But some things in life you'll learn to resent.

(Chorus)
And you Know that accidents can happen
and it's okay we all fall off the wagon sometimes
it's not your whole life
 it's only one day, you haven't thrown everything away. 

***SOLO***  

I hear that you slipped again. 
Im here cause I know you'll need a friend. 
And you know that accidents can happen and it's okay
we all fall off the wagon sometimes,
It's not your whole life
It's only one day, 
You haven't thrown everything away. 
And you know that accidents can happen
and it's okay we all fall off the wagon sometimes,
It's not your whole life
It's only one day, 
You haven't thrown everything away. 
Do don't give up, 
It takes Awhile.---Lyrics submitted by Austin.
