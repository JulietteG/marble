She lights a candle but she doesn't know why.
She wants to save me, but I'm barely alive.
My soul is thursty, I just wanna get high and make her go away

And now I'm hitting the wall and she begs me to quit
and she drags me to church, but I'm scared to commit
And I'm losing my mind cuz she hides all my shit, she won't go away

And all I ask of her is pray for me
Cuz I don't want to pray for me
If you love me cross your heart and hope that I won't die before the best day of my life
Just pray for me tonight

I drag myself out of the bed that she made 
And I escape her in a black motorcade
She pushing bibles and a clean bill of health
I can't make her go away

And now I'm hitting the wall and she begs me to quit
And she drags me to church but I'm scared to commit
And I'm losing my mind cuz she hides all my shit
She won't go away

And all I ask of her is pray for me
Cuz I don't want to pray for me
If you love me cross your heart and hope that I don't die before the last day of my life
Just pray for me tonight

Now I'm hitting the wall and she begs me to quit
And she drags me to church but I'm scared to commit
And I'm losing my mind cuz she hides all my shit


And all I ask of her is pray for me
I don't want to pray for me
If you love me cross your heart and hope that don't die before the best day of my life

Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me---Lyrics submitted by Melinda.
