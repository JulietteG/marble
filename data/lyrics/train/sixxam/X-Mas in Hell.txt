Van nuys
Merry Christmas
Well thats what people say at christmas, right
except for normally they have someone to say it to
they have friends and family
They haven't been crouched naked under a christmas tree
with a needle in there arm
like an insane person in a mansion in van nuys
They're not out of their minds
they're not writing in a diary
and they're defiantly not watching there holiday spirit coagulate in a spoon
I didn't speak to a single person today
I thought... 
why should i ruin their f****** christmas 
I've started a new diary
and this time i have a few new reasons
one i have no friends left
two so i could read back and remember what i did the day before 
and three so if i die then i'll leave nice little suicide note of my life
It's just me and you diary
Welcome to my f****** life!!

nobody would believe the s*** that happens inside my head
its haunted 
now that i've come down from the drugs
it seems like a sick play
that i saw in a theatre some where
30 minutes ago i could have killed somebody 
or better yet myself---Lyrics submitted by Lexi.
