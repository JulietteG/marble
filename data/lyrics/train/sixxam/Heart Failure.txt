When I think back on this life
I guess we were doing the best we could
And to look at us from the outside
I'm sure it seems somewhat romantic
but when you've tasted excess
Everything else tastes bland
Yeah, we had everything to lose
But we still lived like we were about to die
After all, we were the drug scouts of america

I've begun evaporating
Right before your eyes
I just keep regurgitating
My own demise

I miss today I miss the past
I miss my veins 'cause they've collapsed
A simple thought occurs to me

I'm face down on the tracks
The train is coming fast
And it's not derailing
It's not the first time
And this won't be the last
That my heart is failing

As the blood is rushing 
to my head
And from my wrists
I'm in love with all the things I know I should resist

And all the times you said to me
Your falling down ones destiny
A simple thought occurs to me

I'm face down on the tracks
The train is coming fast
And you're right there waiting
It's not the first time
And this won't be the last
That my heart is failing

[Spoken]
Like I was saying
The look in the eyes of death
Was intoxicating
Taking it into our lungs
Laughing at ourselves
Where others would probably cry
And more importantly
I'm proud of this guy
Staring face to face with the demons
And not back down
Takes a constitution that most people just don't have
A life gets soiled with sex, drugs and rock and roll

I'm face down on the tracks
The train is coming fast
And it's not derailing
It's not the first time
And this won't be the last
That my heart is failing

I'm face down on the tracks
The train is coming fast
And you're right there waiting
It's not the first time
And this won't be the last
That my heart is failing---Lyrics submitted by stephanie.
