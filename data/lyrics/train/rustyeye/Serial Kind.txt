Sometimes I feel like prowling around
Victims are numbered
Theres nowhere to hide from me
Inside my mind darkness youll find

Do you ever wonder
What really goes inside my mind?
Oh yeah
The killer's mind? 
Oh yeah
The serial kind
Curiosity will kill the cat! 

Society wants to put me away
They think Im vicious, a little insane
If they only knew theres more out there like me 

Do you ever wonder
What really goes inside my mind?
Oh yeah
The killer's mind? 
Oh yeah
The serial kind
There must be somebody else inside!---Lyrics submitted by Miss.
