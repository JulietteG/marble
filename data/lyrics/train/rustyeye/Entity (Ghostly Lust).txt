When the night has fallen
I become aware of the entity in here
The Entity is near
Falling for each other
Its a love affair of the kind that mustnt be
I listen to its plea

So it whispers 
And it lingers
Underneath my skin
Underneath my skin
But its love is
Suffocating me!

Maybe my spirit is in bliss
And I must fulfill its wish 

Now everyone advices me 
There is no point in opening doors to the unseen
You dont know where theyve been
But tonight I cant resist
He said: I will come to visit while you sleep,
And Ill kill you painlessly

So it whispers 
And it lingers
Underneath my skin
Underneath my skin
But its love is
Suffocating me!


Maybe my spirit is in bliss
And I must fulfill its wish---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
