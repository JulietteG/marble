Raised in Fear
We shed not tears

Mondo Cane, give me all you can
Inhumane rabid hungry monster man

Senseless mating animal rules 
Consumed by hatred, branding of fools 
Carnage, slaughter, greediness
Our primitive others resemble our truth

Raised in Fear
We shed not tears

Mondo Cane, give me all you can
Inhumane rabid hungry monster man

Ruthless faking, our vision is obtuse
Intoxicated, evenly abused
Torture, famine, bloodiness
Ravaging jungle, there is no escape---Lyrics submitted by Miss.
