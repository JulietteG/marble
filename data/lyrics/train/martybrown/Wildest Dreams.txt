As I woke up this morning and through sleepy eyes
I caught you watching me sleeping and I realized
That you are the reason I get up each day
And you are the sunshine when my skies are gray
And you are the reason I feel this way

In my wildest dreams never would I believe
You could love a man like me
I'm just as common as I can be
And this love could only happen to me
In my wildest dreams

Only in dream can I be feelin' this way
It would be a nightmare baby
If you ever went away
Because you are the reason for the way that i feel
Is this love a dream or is it for real?
If this is a dream I'll sleep a thousand years
And wake up to find you lying right here

In my wildest dreams never would I believe
You could love someone like me
I'm just as common as I can be
And this love could only happen to me
In my wildest dreams

I'm just as common as I can be
This love could only happen to me
In my wildest dreams---Lyrics submitted by Sean.
