An old fashioned girl, in these modern times
O don't you know, they're so hard to find
Like the rarest of diamonds, most precious of pearls
You've got to search all over this world
Girl I've looked for you, for such a long time
I'll do anything to make you mine

I'll climb any mountain
I'll swim any sea
I'll crawl 'cross the desert on my hands and knees
I'll be your fool, if you want me to be
If that's what it takes to make you love me

I've waited for so long for someone like you
Someone to lean on, and always be true
Well time is a teacher, time takes it tolls
But this time my darlin' I want you to know

I'll climb any mountain
I'll swim any sea
I'll crawl 'cross the desert on my hands and knees
I'll be your fool, if you want me to be
If that's what it takes...

I'll climb any mountain
I'll swim any sea
I'll crawl 'cross the desert on my hands and knees
I'll be your fool, if you want me to be
If that's what it takes to make you love me

I'll be your fool, if you want me to be 
If that's what it takes to make you love me---Lyrics submitted by Sean.
