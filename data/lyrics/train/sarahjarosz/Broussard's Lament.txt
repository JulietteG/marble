Storm it did rage on
The coastal shore
Winds blew so strong
Then the floods came on
People cried what took so long
For hell - to come along

Answers came cheap at the break of dawn
Sound bites playin' on and on and on
They told us Thursday they would come 
They told us Friday they would come
Saturday came and still the dying lived on

The missing ones were lost,
Not to be found
They paid the cost,
You let them down
Well we said what can we do
Just to make - it up to you

Oh you can try to make this up to me
All I have is lost, not much to see
They told me Thursday they would come 
They told me Friday they would come
Saturday's here and I'm trying find my home
Oh the time is here, time to find my home---Lyrics submitted by Marissa Cabello.
