When I wake up hungry please be there
When I'm dark and thirsty please be there
On the lowdown Sunday say my prayer
When I need somebody please be there

Talk to me and I'll talk to you
Ain't it nice to know that you're breaking through?
Anything that you want me to
Ask me now and it's coming true

Come with me and I'll go with you
When the buds outside still wear the dew
You said that last night that you dreamed you flew
Take my hand that's what we'll do

Please be there I can hardly believe it
Please be there because you really see me
Please be there so don't ever leave it
Please be there with me ---Lyrics submitted by Orleans.
