Fleeing shadows and the neon glow
Reflected in a shop window
Rain glistens on a city street
The neon flickers as we meet

Why do taxis turn their lights off?
Why did our love never leave off?

Fleeing shadows and the neon glow
Reflected in a shop window
Rain glistens on a city street
The neon flickers as we meet

Why do taxis turn their lights off? (well get by well get by)
Why did our love never leave off? (well get by well get by)

Helpless cry from a balcony
Blue smoke will linger when I see you leave (well get by well get by)
Still theres the smell of your cigarette
I feel like we never ever even met (well get by well get by)

Helpless cry from a balcony
Blue smoke will linger when I see you leave (well get by well get by)
Still theres the smell of your cigarette
I feel like we never ever even met (well get by well get by)---Lyrics submitted by Spit Take.
