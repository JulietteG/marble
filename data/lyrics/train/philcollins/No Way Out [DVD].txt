Everywhere I turn I hurt someone
But there's nothing I can say to change the things I've done
Of all the things I've hid from you I can not hid the shame
And I pray someone something will come to take away the pain

There's no way out of this dark place 
No hope, no future
I know I can't be free
But I can't see another way
And I can't face another day

Tell me where did i go wrong
Everyone I love, they're all gone
I'd do everything so differently
But I can't turn back the time
Theres no shelter from the storm inside of me
ooohhh oh oh oh 

There's no way out of this dark place
No hope, no future
I know I can't be free
But I can't see another way
And I can't face anther day

Can't believe the words I hear
It's like an answer to a prayer
and when I look around I see, 
this place, this time, this friend of mine

I know It's hard but found somehow
To look into your heart and to forgive me now
You've given me the strength to see just where my journey ends
You've given me the strength to carry on

I see the path from this dark place
I see my future
And your forgiveness has set me free
Oh, and I can see another way
I can face another day
(I see the path) I can see the path
I see my future
(I see the future) I see the path from this dark place 
I see my future
I see the path from this dark place---Lyrics submitted by Cho.
