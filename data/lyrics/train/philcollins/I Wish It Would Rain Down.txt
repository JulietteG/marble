You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend (year)
All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why

Now I, oo... now I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooo.. yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooo.. yes I wish it will rain down, down on me
Ooo.. yes I wish it will rain down on me

You said you didn't need me in your life
I guess you were right (year)
Oo... I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again (year)

Now I, now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooo.. yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooo.. girl I wish it will rain down, down on me
Ooo.. yes I wish it will rain down on me

Though your hurt is gone, mines hanging on, inside
And I know it's eating me through, its eating me through every night and day
I'm just waiting on your sign

'Cos I know, I know I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down
But I know in my heart of heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again

Now I, now I know I wish it will rain down, down on me
Oh I know I wish it will rain, rain down on me now
Oo... I wish it will rain down, down on me
Yes you know I wish it will rain down, rain down over me
Just rain down over me
Just let it rain down, let it rain down, let it rain down...
Oh yea let it rain down, rain, rain down over me
Just let it rain down,
Just let it rain down, let it rain down
Just let it rain ---
