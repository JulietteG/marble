You should not be here acting like you are
Calling me baby and holding out your arms
Let me remind you what we agreed to do
You would not see me and I would not see you

Take two steps back now
You know youre coming way too close
Just makes it harder letting you go
Cause Im okay now with our goodbye
I can have you wasting my precious time

What are you doing flirtin with me
You were the one said you wanna be free
I dont wanna play games with you
Just getting used to being without you
Now youre showing up and being all sexy
Talking like you wanna be with me
You gotta know what youre putting me through
What are you doing what are you doing

It was no secret you meant the world to me
I cant go back to how it used to be
Ive come a long way through empty days and sleepless nights
To realize I dont need you in my life

I know you so well youre just seeking bout yourself
Save up that sweet talk for somebody else
Cause Im okay now with our goodbye
Know your just thinking Ill be changing my mind

What are you doing flirtin with me
You were the one said you wanna be free
I dont wanna play games with you
Just getting used to being without you
Now youre showing up and being all sexy
Talking like you wanna be with me
You gotta know what youre putting me through
What are you doing what are you doing

So what are you doing flirtin with me
You were the one said you wanna be free
I dont wanna play games with you
Just getting used to being without you
Now youre showing up and being all sexy
Talking like you wanna be with me
You gotta know what youre putting me through
What are you doing what are you doing

what are you doing flirtin with me
You were the one said you wanna be free
I dont wanna play games with you
Just getting used to being without you
Now youre showing up and being all sexy
Talking like you wanna be with me
You gotta know what youre putting me through
What are you doing what are you doing

What are you doing flirtin' with me? ---
