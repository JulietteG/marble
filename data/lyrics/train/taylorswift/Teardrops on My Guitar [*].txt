Drew loos at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need and
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh cause it's so damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breath
And there he goes so perfectly 
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and knows she's lucky cause...

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing don't know why I do

* Music *

So I'll drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one that's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing don't know why I do

He's the time taken up
But there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see---Lyrics submitted by Cindy.
