Elevator buttons and morning air
Stranger's silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, my choice is you

Chorus
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care cuz right now you're mine

Chorus
And you'll say, So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours.

And its not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong in
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
Cuz I love the gap between your teeth
I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored cuz my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours---Lyrics submitted by anna.
