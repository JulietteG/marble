Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
Shell open up the door
And say, are you insane, ane?
See its been a long six months
And you were too afraid
To tell her what you want, want

And thats how it works
Thats how you get the girl
And then you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, Ill put it back together
I would wait forever and ever

And thats how it works
Its how you get the girl, girl
And thats how it works
Its how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it used to be, be
With pictures in frames
Of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

And thats how it works
Thats how you lost the girl
And now you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, Ill put it back together
I would wait forever and ever

And thats how it works
Its how you get the girl, girl
And thats how it works
Its how you get the girl, girl

And you know
That I dont want you to go
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me
And then you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, Ill put it back together
I would wait forever and ever

And thats how it works
Its how you get the girl, girl
And thats how it works
Its how you get the girl, girl

And thats how it works
Its how you get the girl, girl
And thats how it works
Its how you get the girl, girl

Thats how it works
Its how you got the girl---
