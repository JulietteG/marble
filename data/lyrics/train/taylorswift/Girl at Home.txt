Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Ah, ah
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
It's kind of like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer and crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition if I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception,
This I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Ah, ah
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

And I see you turn off your phone, 
And now you've got me alone
And I say, 
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure you understand perfectly 
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition if I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it, if I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Ah, ah
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

And I see you turn off your phone, 
And now you've got me alone
And I say, 
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number,
Let's consider this a lesson learned

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Ah, ah
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

When I see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition if I hadn't once been just like her.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
