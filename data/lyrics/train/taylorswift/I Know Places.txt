You stand with your hand on my waistline
Its a scene and were out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
Its a bad sign, bad sign

Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling in dark clouds
Loves a fragile little flame
It could burn out, it could burn out

'Cause they got the cages
They got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby, I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash, and well run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we wont hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand
And dont ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters
We are the foxes, and we run

Baby, I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters
We are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand
And dont ever drop it my love

Baby, I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, were bulletproof
(I know places)
And you know for me, its always you
(I know places)
In the dead of night, you act so brave
(I know places)
And I know for you, its always me
(I know places)---
