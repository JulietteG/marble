Wish I had concentrated, 
They said love was complicated, 
But it's something I just fell into, 

And it was over-rated
just look what I've created
I came out alive but I'm black and blue-ue

Before you ask me if I'm alright, 
Think about what I, 
Had to do-oo, yeah

Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan, 
And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me, 
Wish you could only see, 
I've got an I heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand.

I'd be fine if you just walked by, 
But you had to talk about why, 
You were wrong and I was right, 

But I can't believe you made me, 
Sit at home, cry like a baby, 
Wait right by the phone every night, 

And now you ask about you and I, 
There's no you and I, 
Remember what you put me through, 
I had to, 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Fix my heart put on my make-up, 
Another mess I didn't plan, 
And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
I wish you'd could only see
I got an I heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand 

And when you're home alone at night, 
You'll still wonder 
Why you took everything I had, oh baby
and now youthink about you and I, 
There's no you and I, 
And I know, 
Someday you will... 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planned, 
And you'll know you didn't beat me, 
When you look down and see, 
I've got an I heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand, 
Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand---Lyrics submitted by v.
