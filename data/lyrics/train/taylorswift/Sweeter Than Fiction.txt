Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)
Only sound, only sound that you hear is no
You never saw it coming
Except when you started runnning
And now you come undone (I, I, I)

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on you knees (eh, eh)
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen you colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you wont remember,
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now youre on to something
I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Put me right, threw me right when you put them front
And in this perfect weather
Its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Bridge]
Ill be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
Ill be one of the many saying
Youve made us proud, youve made us proud

Ill be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
Ill be one of the many saying
Youve made us proud, youve made us proud, proud

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that Ill be there time and again
Cause I you loved when

When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is no
Now in this perfect weather
Its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction---
