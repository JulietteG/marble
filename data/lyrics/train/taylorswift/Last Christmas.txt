Last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

Once bitten and twice shy,
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye.
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year. It doesn't surprise me.

Merry Christmas. I wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying "I Love You"
I meant it.
Now I know what a fool I've been,
but if you kiss me now, 
I know you'll fool me again.

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes.
I'm hiding from you and your soul of eyes.
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on.
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart.
A girl on a cover, but you tore her apart.
May be this year, maybe this year,
I'll give it to someone special.

Cause last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart, 
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.---Lyrics submitted by Paige.
