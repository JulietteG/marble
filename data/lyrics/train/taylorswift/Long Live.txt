I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind 
The time we stood with our shaking hands 
The crowds and stands went wild 
We were the Kings and the Queens 
And they read off our names 
The night you danced like you knew our lives 
Would never be the same 
You held your head like a hero 
On a history book page 
It was the end of a decade 
But the start of an age 

Long live the walls we crashed through 
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you 
I was screaming long live all the magic we made 
And bring on all the pretenders 
One day we will be remembered 

I said remember this feeling 
I passed the pictures around 
Of all the years that we stood there 
On the side-lines wishing for right now 
We are the Kings and the Queen 
You trade your baseball cap for a crown 
When they gave us our trophies 
And we help them up for our town 
And the cynics were outraged 
Screaming this is absurd 
Cause for a moment a band of theives 
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world 

Long live the walls we crashed through 
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you 
I was screaming long live all the magic we made 
And bring on all the pretenders 
I'm not afraid 
Long live all the mountains we moved 
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you 
I was screaming long live the look on your face 
And bring on all the pretenders 
One day we will be remembered 

Hold on to spinning around 
Confetti falls to the ground 
May these memories break our fall 
Will you take a moment, promise me this 
That you'll stand by my forever 
But if god forbid fate should step in 
And force us into a goodbye 
If you have children some day 
When they point to the pictures 
Please tell them my name 
Tell them how the crowds went wild 
Tell them how our hope it shined 

Long live all the mountains we moved 
I had the time of my life with you 
Long, long live the walls we crashed through 
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you 
I was screaming long live all the magic we made 
And bring on all the pretenders 
I'm not afraid 
Long live all the mountains we moved 
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you 
I was screaming long live the look on your face 
And bring on all the pretenders 
One day we will be remembered---Lyrics submitted by millie.
