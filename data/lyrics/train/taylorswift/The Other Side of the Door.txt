In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying 
Trying make me stay
I said this time i've had enough
and you've called a hundred times but i'm not picking up
cause I'm so mad I might tell you that its over
but if you look a little closer

I said leave but all I really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming I'm in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain 
come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause I know all I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupied pride
are sitting here alone
goin through the photographs 
staring at the phone
I keep going back over 
things we both said
and I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread
so baby if you know everything
tell me why you couldn't see
that when I left I wanted you to
chase after me yeah

I said leave but all I really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming I'm in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain
come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause I know all i need is on the other side of the door

and I scream out the window I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say there's nothing you can say
to make this right again and I mean it, I mean it
what I mean is
I said leave but baby all I want is you 
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming I'm in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
and dont you leave 'cause I now all I need is on the other side of the door

with your face and beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carry me from you car up the stairs
and I broke down crying was she worth this mess
after everything in that little black dress
after everything i must confess
I need you---Lyrics submitted by Nathalie.
