Go ahead
Go ahead- smash it on the floor
Take whatever's left and take it 
with you out the door

See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tea
I can't say that it's been that great-
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year

Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And its been that way too long

Take it as it comes
And be thankful when its done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Let it out
Let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream 
And shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah

See if I care
See if I stand firm or if I fall
'Cause in the back of my mind
And on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all

And everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And its been that way too long

Take it as it comes
And be thankful when its done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black

Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And its been that way too long

So take it as it comes
And be thankful when its done
There's so many ways to act
And you cannot take it back
No you cannot take it back
This is many shades of black

There's so many shades of black     ] Four
Yeah there's many shades of black  ] Times
There's so many shades of black

Go ahead...---Lyrics submitted by Gracie.
