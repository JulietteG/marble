Well I went to the river but I could not get across
Ive done your papa cause I thought he was a horse, oh man now
Rolled him over, and got some Coca-Cola
Lemon soda, saucer of ice cream
Some soap and water just to try to keep your papa clean

Well, up she jumped, and then down she fell
Her mouth flew open like a mussel shell, and n-now
Rolled her over, and got some Coca-Cola
Lemon soda and saucer of ice cream
Soap and water yeah,
To try to keep her clean.

Your sister was a teddy and your daddy was a bear
I put a muzzle on your mama she had bad hair now
I rolled her over and I got some Coca-Cola
Lemon soda and a,  saucer of ice cream
Soap and water, well I try to keep your mama clean,

If you wanna hear Jack White yelling yeah - yeah - yeah
Get down to the river, wash your yeah - yeah - yeahs, girl.
Come on in over, get some Coca Cola
Lemon soda, and saucer of ice cream.
Soap and water you girls better keep it clean!

Yeah If you want to go to heaven when you D-I-E
Put on the collar and your T-I-E, boy,
Casanova  come on get some Coca-Cola,
Lemon soda and a saucer of ice cream.
Soap and water gonna help you try to keep it clean

Well you run to the doctor and run there fast
and girl have him check out your  yeah - yeah  yeahs now,
Get it over, some Coca Cola,
Lemon soda, saucer of ice cream
Soap and water, you know we all got to keep it clean.---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
