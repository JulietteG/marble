Excuse me girl
I know it's a bit embarrassing but
I just noticed some tan lines
On your shirt

See I reckon you're about an 8 or a 9,
Maybe even 9 and a half in four beers time.
That blue top shop top you've got on IS nice,
Bit too much fake tan though - but yeah you score high.

But there's just one little thing that really really,
Really really annoying me about you you see,
Yeah yeah like I said you are really fit
But my gosh don't you just know it

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit But my gosh don't you know it

So when I looked at you standing there with your hoard,
I was waiting in the queue looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a Burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction
Your eyes locked onto my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order,
Which cost me my place in the queue I waited for YEAH

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

Whoa! Leave it out
Are you smoking crack or something?
Leave it Out
Mike just leave it just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment
S'not worth it mike, just leave it
Don't Touch Me, S'not Worth It
Don't Touch Me, D, Look I'm Alright
Don't Touch me

For a while there I was thinking - yeah but what if?
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you too yeah I had to admit
That yeah yeah you are fit,
And yeah I do want it,
But I stop sharking for a minute to get chips and drinks

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit But my gosh don't you know it

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier choosing a brew.
But I am digressing slightly so I'll continue.
I didn't want to bowl over all geezer and rude,
Not rude like good but just rude like uncouth,
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you,
But let me tell you, see, yes, yes, but you are really rude,
And rude as in good, I knew this as you stood and queued,
But I just did not want to give the satisfaction to you!

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit But my gosh don't you know it

Oy, just as you started to make your big advance

With the milkshake and that little donut in hand
I was like nah, I can't, even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smiling hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty hearty looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit But my gosh don't you know it

What do I give a fuck.. I've got a girlfirend anyway
(whoa, we've all had a drink mate)
We're all a bit drunk, yeah we've had a few fair play
I got this stella I bombed from that last caf
This nights not even begun, yes yes oh yay

I did fancy you a bit though yeah I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
On otherwise a total result of a holiday

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit But my gosh don't you know it

Ha ha huh huh huh
You're fit but you know it
You're fit but you know it
You're fit but you know it
I think I'm going to fall over
I think I'm going to fall
Fucking hell---
