Bands they make her dance apocalyptic now
Bands they make her dance apocalyptic
Bands they make her dance apocalyptic now
Bands they make her dance apocalyptic

You're going crazy
The hitmen always find you
Do that dance
Smoking in the girls room
Kiss in France
It's over like a comic book
Exploding in a bathroom stall
She's so freaked out
Worrying about the bomb but
You bought a house
But I'm allergic to the house pets
Your credit cards
They bought a new wife
For shiny little lonely men

But I really, really wanna thank you
For dancing 'til the end
You found a way to break out
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalangalangalang
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you break out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalangalangalang
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalangalangalang

You gotta laugh at the zombie in the front yard
Take a bath, but nothing gets the funk off
You're on TV, rocking and a rolling
Cause the dead just love to rock and roll
Sick and tired of food tasting plastic
You wanna cry
But they grew up without a real kitchen
Asking why the pain is always equal
But the joy just never spreads around

But I really, really wanna thank you
For dancing 'til the end
You found a way to break out
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalangalangalang
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you break out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalangalangalang
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop

You're going crazy
The hitmen always find you
Do that dance
Smoking in the girls room
Kissing friends
Keep a rocking and a rolling
Cause the dead just love to rock and roll
So freaked out, worried about the bomb
Bought a house, but I'm allergic to the house pets
Your credit cards, working and a-bobbing
Just to make enough to pay your rent

But I really, really wanna thank you
For dancing 'til the end
You found a way to break out
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalangalangalang
But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you break out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalangalangalang
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalangalangalang

[Spoken]
I've been
Look at you
You look just like a little old earthquake
Break it, break it
You got to break it
Ain't no order in this courtroom
Smash, smash, bang, bang
(Y'all going to jail)
Don't stop
Chalangalangalang

What's the matter?
Your chicken tastes like pork?
You have triplets instead of twins?
Is your food taste plastic?
Grandaddy, I think I wanna dance ---
