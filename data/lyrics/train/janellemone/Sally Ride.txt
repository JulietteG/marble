Take me to the river
My soul is looking for a word from God
Ooh, God
Like a rose in the cold will I rise
I'm packing my space suit
And I'm taking my shit and moving to the moon
Where there're no rules
Wake up, Mary
Have you heard the news
You got to wake up, Mary
You got the right to choose
I tried and heard the pride
But the way the stars look into my eyes tonight
Tell me who can , who can I trust?

[Bridge]
To get lost in your thoughts
Is a very very complex thought?
And the things that you thought are surprising
It's the way you believe
That becomes the very thing you see
Take a ride in the sky
It's just calling

But all your friends are gone
And the trees will burn while the comets play on
Tell me who can, who can I trust?
I wanna fly
Fly
All the way
To the moon
To the stars 
Ohhh!

[Hook]
Ride, ride, ride
Sally won't you
Ride, ride, ride

[Spoken x2]
I know you love me but I'm still gone x3
I got to make my peace
I got to move on

[Janelle Monae ]
Just wake up, Mary
Have you heard the news?
Oh, just wake up, Mary
You got the right to choose
Just wake up, Mary,
There's some amazing news
Just wake up, Mary
You got the right to choose

[Janelle Monae ]
Real love
I wanna feel the real love
True love, ain't nobody got to steal love
Wanna know what it really means to be in love
Baby...free love
Sometimes I just wanna get away
Going on Going on right now.---Lyrics submitted by Trevin Griffin.
