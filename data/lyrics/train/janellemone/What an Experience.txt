[Verse 1]
We party every night
Then we all just walk off in the rain
Even angels fight
And our wings just keep getting in the way
Babe I can't wait
Our loves so strong
So deep in my heart
Yeah I've been feeling it all day long
Baby dont wait
Loves too strong
I feel it all over, and oh!

[Chorus]
What an Experience (can you feel it feel it feel it?)
What an Experience (Yeah, I can really really feel it.)
What an Experience (Ooh, can you feel it feel it feel it?)
Put your hand over my heart

[Verse 2]
The world's just made to fade
And all the parties some day blow away
But the memories come home, yeah they do
Its funny how they come back with a song
Yeah baby I can't wait
This love is too strong
I can feel it all over
Oh baby I
Babe I can't wait
Love's too strong
I feel it all over, and oh!

[Chorus]

BRIDGE:
Sweet sweet wine wont you feel so fine
I'm drinking the love you pour into my life
Open my mind like a good red wine
The sun will dance until the sky dont shine
When my eyes see your eyes
You taking my body shake it left to right
In my life you're a good red wine
And you keep buzzing my mind

[Chorus + Bridge]---Lyrics submitted by Trevin Griffin.
