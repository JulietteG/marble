I think Ive become like one of the others 
I think Ive become like one of the others 
I think Ive become like one of the others

There was a frail syrup dripping off His lap danced lapel, punctuated by her Decrepit prowl she washed down the hatching Gizzard soft as a mane of needles His orifice icicles hemorrhaged By combing her torso to a pile Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse She was a mink handjob in sarcophagus heels

Bring me to my knees 
Read the sharpened lines 
All my arms, bled me blind 
Faucet leaks in shadows 
Spilling from morgue lancet 
Caressed your fontanelle 
I've sworn to kill every last one 
Every last one 
Panic in the shakes of the wounded 
Panic in the worms 
Onto the floor And out of your mouth Out of your eyelids

No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches 
No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches

All your dreams, splintered off 
Leech by leech on this catafalque 
Anyone will tell you, yes anyone 
Chance had me setting a trip wire alarm 
Your mother flirted with disease 
When she skinned that costume by its navel strings 
Panic in the shakes of the wounded 
Panic in the worms, 
onto the floor And out of your mouth out of your eyelids

No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches 
No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches 
No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches 

Shock lest shackles free you
Volt face cons abandon you again I wont feel not this time

Brick by brick, the night eclipsed 
Pricked by cuticle thorns 
Dried the sleep on nursery slits Into this life Im born 
Heavens just a scab away 
Id like to see you after just one taste

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more, let them see it has begun
The others Ive become

If you should see the dice, 
charmed with Its snaked choked eyes 
Youll wear the widows weeds 
Because theyre just your size

Behind the snail secretion, 
leaves a dry heave that absorbs 
A limbless procreation, let the infant crawled deformed 
A bag replaced the breath of these suffocating sheets 
And now when the craving calls Ill scratch my itchy teeth

Come on and sing it now 

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more 
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more

She fell for the whispers, 
sister flooded deaf tears 
That night tore a river, in her baron womb mirror 
And his multiple sons with their mandible tongues 
Set crucified fires to petrified homes
let it burn

And the owls they were watching 
And the owls didnt care 
Then the owls came a knocking, placenta in their stares 
They will feed on all the carnage, leftover from the flood 
And in the corner of their eyes, fled sister L Via

Now the pieces went floating, reflecting all at dusk 
Conceived from the stabbing, was Vismund Cygnus

Twenty five wives in the lake tonight 
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine 
Twenty five snakes pour out your eyes 
Yeah the icepicks cumming on the marble shrine 
Twenty five snakes are drowning

You cant bend your crooked arms or fold your punctured proof 
The air is growing cold and theres nothing you can do 
Soon therell be no gauze, inside the confessional 
Only rows of crows, defrocking every breath

And one day youll remember 
Behind the melting cones, 
you always had a family In the burial of your home

Ill peel back all of my skin 
Peel back and let it all run

Brick by brick, 
the night eclipsed Pricked by the cuticle thorns, dried the sleep 
On nursery slits into this life Im born 
Havens just a scab away Id like to see you after just one taste 
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight 
Night forever more, let them see it has begun 
The others Ive become

No theres no light, in the darkest Of your furthest reaches 
No theres no light, no theres no time 
You aint got nothing, your life was just a lie.---Lyrics submitted by nadja.
