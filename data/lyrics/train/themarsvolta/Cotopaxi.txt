When Sanskrit was my mother tongue
Scarabs filled my pillow
Tarmac strips to pave for them
Thrones from which to teach

And in that pulse the future said
The story had been spun
You wet your bed so sleep in it
Cards can't make a house

Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's why I'll magnify a hole

When light years came and light years passed
Tuggin' on the brink
Spoils reported missin'
Put down in it's sleep

Strangled in the background
Fitted for a mask
The future won't believe you
Passed the ransom fast

Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's why I'll magnify a hole

Don't beat around the pulpit
There is no lost and found
Where is the devil waiting
Trying to disguise

I've seen what you used to look like
Down here you won't survive

I've got the weight of half of the world
Don't stop dragging the lake
Don't stop dragging the lake
I won't come home if you can't come home
Even if you make a grave with my name

I've got the weight of half of the world
You'd better keep on lookin' for me
I won't come home if you can't come home
Don't stop dragging the lake
Don't stop dragging the lake

Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
Up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's why I'll magnify a hole
(In your abdomen)

Find me the head
And I'll show you the body

Lay it to rest
Don't say you're sorry---Lyrics submitted by Shiloh.
