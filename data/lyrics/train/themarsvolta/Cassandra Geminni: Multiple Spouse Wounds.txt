You cant bend your crooked arms or fold your punctured proof 
The air is growing cold and theres nothing you can do 
Soon therell be no gauze, inside the confessional 
Only rows of crows, defrocking every breath

And one day youll remember 
Behind the melting cones, 
you always had a family In the burial of your home

Ill peel back all of my skin 
Peel back and let it all run---Lyrics submitted by nadja.
