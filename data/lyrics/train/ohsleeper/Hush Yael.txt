Hush yael, I hear them coming, we'll hide here until we're safe 
Just hold tight to me until they find what they need
 Hush yael, I hear them leaving for the beach
 Where on the stone and sand your sister finds her sleep.

Wet your jaws for the world
 We're going back to the darkest hours
 Where our kind has confirmed
 We are the masters of sin and slaughter

On the 22nd day of the 4th month, 1979 warrants a judgement
 Because he came and he saw
 And this coward conquered a family asleep in their home
 Rise 
Rise
 We must rise for the helpless and fight for their justice

So lift your voices high
 Higher than the mountains of their spite
 We are we are the fearless, the ruthless, the heralds of our time

So lift your voices high
 Higher than the mountains of their spite
 We are we are the fearless, the ruthless, the heroes of our time

She had to watch him pull the trigger in her daddy's back
 Then put his face to the waves until he took his last
 Then he took her life with the butt of his gun
 Four years from when her life had begun

Rise
 Rise
 Rise
 Rise

We are all weavers at the loom of slaughter
 But we will rise and make these victims our martyrs

So lift your voices high
 Higher than the mountains of their spite
 We are we are the fearless, the ruthless, the heralds of our time

So lift your voices high
 Higher than the mountains of their spite
 We are we are the fearless, the ruthless, the heroes of our time

Make him beg for his life
 He made me watch as my family died
 He'll never know what it's like
 So cut him slow until his soul takes flight

Hush yael, they found him and they put him in chains
 The one who broke our home
 Is finally feeling pain

Hush little yael, I'm sorry your lungs are empty
 But in your new home
 That man will not be seen

End him slow
 End him slow
 Make him feel the rocks that her temple rode
 End him slow
 End him slow
 End him slow---Lyrics submitted by Chris Carter.
