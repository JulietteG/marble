silence screams,you're just so beautiful in blue
breathless stares escape your undying eyes
are you blind to my sorrow and sympathy?
a piece of me will die with your last breath...
this will all be over soon for you are so lost inside
glazed eyes long for the waves' embrace
drawn to an end so near...

far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice
why are you trying to run away?
my love, I can't find the words to tell you...

drown all of your fantasies with your final broken promise
silent angel crashes through sky, having lost sight of the stars

REGAIL  me with your tales of LONELY, bittersweet loss
GIVINGup comes to easy WHEN hope is gone
I'll walk away so you can choke on your dying breath
but if you side against me, to hell with you...

FAR AWAY are days when you smiled just to hear my voice
why are you trying to run away?
my love, I can't find the words TO TELL YOU..

the fear has stolen her heart as she wakes from her dream
treacherous ink finds her lungs, seizing her screams
numb hands now reach too late to take back the light

far away are days when you smiled just to hear my voice
why are you trying to run away?
my love, I can't find the words to tell you...
far away are days when you smiled...
seas cry out butchering this tragic soul without hope
their frailty is broken and now fades into the blue...---Lyrics submitted by cedric.
