Look at the sky as the night descends. 
The rain is crashing down, I hit another dennit. 
Just before I let hope slip away, a shadow is revealed the devil shows his face. 

I'm scared to death and have myself to blame 
(I'm to blame) 
How did we end up fighting anyway? 

You know i used to search the sky and dream of where you were. 
I need you by my side. 
We can end this together. 
I know I promised you the world and still i let you down. 
I need you by my side, and together we'll end this now. 

Look at my eyes, am I shaking now? 
I am all you fear. 
Have I made myself clear? 

Shut your mouth and finish what you've started. 

Boy you haven' got the slightest idea
of who i am or what I've done for you
can't you see i am trying to save you? 
Shut your mouth and finish what you've started. 

I'm scared to death and have myself to blame. 
(No one else) 
How did we end up fighting anyway? 

You know I used to search the sky and dream of where you were. 
I need you by my side. 
We can end this together. 
I know I promised you the world and still I let you down. 
I need you by my side, and together we'll end this now. 

As the last rays of sunlight fade
One killer chases another through the tangled madness of the city
A flash of steal mounts as a presence of his quarry
The stage is set, the night explodes 

You killed her, you murderer
You have stripped me of the one that i love
Annabel, our Anabel, you have no clue what she's capable of 

I'm scared to death and have myself to blame 
(I'm scared to death and I have myself to blame) 
How did we end up fighting anyway? 

You know I used to search the sky, and dream of where you were. 
I need you by my side. 
We can end this together. 
I know I promised you the world and still I let you down. 
I need you by my side, and together we can end this now. 

You better look behind you---Lyrics submitted by Sam.
