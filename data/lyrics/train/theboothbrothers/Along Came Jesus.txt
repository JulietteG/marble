Lonely, downhearted looking for a place to go
Searchin here and there and everywhere
Where to go I did not know
Without a song to sing I didnt have anything
No, I was livin on lonely street
Then along came Jesus and He stopped
And rescued me.
Rescued me

You know I was lonely, downhearted
Looking for a place to go
Searchin here and there and everywhere
Where to go I did not know
Without a song to sing I didnt have anything
I was livin on lonely street
Then along came Jesus and He stopped
And rescued me
Rescued me

You know Im happy now
Ever since Jesus came into my heart
Oh Lord Im happy now
Ever since You made my sins depart
No more lonely days and lonely nights
Whoa glory hallelujah
All because Jesus stopped by and rescued me
Rescued me

You know Im happy now
Happy now, Happy now
Ever since Jesus came into my life
And made a great change
Im happy now, happy now, happy now
Ever since Jesus came into my life

Lonely, downhearted
Looking for a place to go
Searchin here and there and everywhere
Without a song to sing I didnt have anything
No I was livin on lonely street
Then along came Jesus and He stopped
And rescued me
He rescued me

Im happy now. Happy now. Happy now
Ever since Jesus came into my life
And made a great change
Im happy now, happy now, happy now
Ever since Jesus came into my life
And rescued me---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
