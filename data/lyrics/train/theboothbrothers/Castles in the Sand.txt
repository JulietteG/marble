Like a child by the seashore
Building castles in the sand
Foolish dreams I have dreamed
Day by day
Leaving God out completely
Till the day my castles grand
Fell apart in the tide and swept away

In each life storms will gather
Rains descend and wild winds blow
Wise the man who in God
Is anchored fast
Are you then like that wise man
Are you anchored do you know
You are safe till the storms of life are past

Castles built upon the sand
Though they seem to be so grand
Will surely melt away
For in lifes raging storm they cannot stand
In the Rock of the Ages
All my hopes are built today
And in the Rock they will never pass away
And in the Rock they will never pass away.---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
