Paul and Silas locked up in a jailhouse
Never losing faith cause
They knew what God could do
Then the walls began to shake
And the prison doors swung open
For they never stopped holding on
To the Hand that brought them through

CHORUS:
When the wind and rain
Blow through the clouds
Thunder and Lightening dance about
When it seems more than I can stand
Gonna keep holding to my Saviors Hand
Though I cant depend on my eyes to see
Through the many storms up ahead of me
I set my sights on the One who can
Gonna keep holding to my Saviors Hand
We are often faced with racking storms
Of life sorrows we cant bear
And fears we cannot hide
Standing on the banks
Of a deep and rushing river
Theres a Hand we can hold onto
Thatll get us to the other side
To the other side

Repeat Chorus

TAG
Though I cant depend on my eyes to see
Through the many storms up ahead of me
I set my sights on the One who can
Gonna keep holding to my Saviors Hand.---Lyrics submitted by Jon Smith.
