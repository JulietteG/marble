I love you, and I need you 
Nelly, I love you, I do need you

[chorus]
"No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All Ithimk about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you"

I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
she got the hot's for me, the finnest thing I'll ever see
But oh, no, no, she got a man and a son,oh-oh,
But that's o.k. cuz I, wait for my cue and just listen
play my position like a short stop pick up everthing mami is hittin'
And in no time, I better make this friend mine
and that's for sure cuz I,
Never been the typeto break up a happy home
But there's something about baby girl I just can't leave her 'lone,
So, tell me ma' what's it gonna be she said,
You don't know what you mean to me, come on

[chorus]

I see a lot in your look and I never say a word
I know how start actin tripin', and hate up all the girls
And there's no way Nellt gon' fight over  
No dame, as you could see
But, I like your steeze, your style, 
your whole demeanor the way you 
come through and holler,and swoop me in his two-seater 
Now that's gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya
don't you forget but it,
ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave
But you and dirty got ties for different reasons
I respect that right before I turned and leave she said,
You don't know what you mean to me, come on

[chorus]

I love you and I need you
Nelly I love you, I do
And it's more than you ever know 
Boy, it's for sure 
you can always count on my love 
Forever more yeah, yeah.

East coast, I know you're shakin' right 
Down south, I know you're bouncin' right
West coast, I know you're walkin' right
Cause you don't know what you mean to me
Midwest, I see you swingin' right

East coast, I know you you're shakin' rigth
Down south, I know you're bouncin' right 
West coast, I know you're walkin' right 
Cause you don't know what you mean to me
Midwest, I see you swingin' right

East coast, I know you're shakin' right 
Down south, I know you're bouncin' right 
West coast, I know you're walkin' right 
Cause you don't know what you mean to me 
Midwest, I see you swingin' right

[chorus]

East coast, I know you're shakin' right
Down south, I know you're bouncin' right
West coast, I know you're walkin' right
You don't know what you mean to me
Midwest, I see you swingin' right

East coast, Iknow your shakin' right
Down sooth, I know you're shakin' right
West coast, I know you're walkin' right
You don't know what you mean to me
 Midwest, I see you swingin' right.---Lyrics submitted by Lucy.
