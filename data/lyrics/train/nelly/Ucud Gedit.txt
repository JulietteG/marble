Nelly:
Hey, babygirl, congratulations
You might just be the baddest bitch I've ever seen
And your demonstration, standin' ovation
Your deserve your own cover of a magazine
You the winner, Ucud gedit
Now, this ain't no number, this a lottery ticket
Be careful with it (be careful with it)
Don't let it out (don't let it out)
See this can get you errthing you dream about
Money (in large amounts)
Cars (I brought 'em out)
An' like a hole in my drawers, I balls out
An' like a hole in my drawers, (you heard me) I balls out

Gucci:
Baby, you the one
You the one for the night

R. Kelly:
Bend it over, touch your toes
Break it down, let it roll
Bring it up and strike a pose
Freak it like you want it, though
Baby, you's a bad honey
Hands down, bad honey
Do it wrong, go home
Do it right, get money
You gotta freak that shit, f-freak that shit like you want it
You gotta show some ass, show some tits, or show sumthin'
Just like a marathon, girl, just...go on, run it
You 'bout to fuck around and come up only 500
Shoppin' sprees, living VIP
Out of the country, when you fuck with me
Hello, Nelly, Gucci, Kelly
You gotta like that, we big tippin'
Call it the rat pack

Gucci:
Baby, you the one
You the one for the night
Whatcha gon' get, girl

Nelly:
Said I never seen a girl like her
I said, I like the way she do that right there
The way she pick it up and bounce it in the air
The way she rock them applebottoms ain't fair

No, I don't play no games, I don't see she funny
Me out here with niggas that get straight to the money
You see though my name ain't Hova, mama
But I can throw up a roxy
Anybody buy a house, but who can buy that ass the block
Now, I wanna take this time to thank my American Express
For allowing me to express my American the best
All you gotta say is yes, and all you gotta do is this
And now your ass rocking with the best

Gucci:
Baby, you the one
You the one for the night
Whatcha gon' get, girl
The best sex of your life?
Ucud gedit
I ain't trippin', I ain't crabbin', I'm tippin'
Real talk, babygirl, ucud gedit

R. Kelly:
Baby, you the winner, winner, winner
winner, winner, winner
Girl, ucud gedit, gedit, gedit
Gedit, gedit, gedit

Bum, bum, bum, bum

Bum, bum, bum (6x)
