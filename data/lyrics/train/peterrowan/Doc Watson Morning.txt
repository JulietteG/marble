Well it rained all night in Frisco, now the clouds have rolled away,
The city lights are glistening out across the bay.
I pick up my old guitar and I start to play
Cause its a Doc Watson mornin D-18 guitar pickin kinda day.

Now Docs real name was Arthel and he played the electrical guitar
The beauty of his melodies were known both near and far.
Somewhere in the 60s Doc had found a D-18
Started pickin them homespun tunes
Clear water from a mountain stream
I pick up my old guitar and I start to play
Cause its a Doc Watson mornin D-18 guitar pickin kinda day.

Now Doc he played the Tennessee Stud and the Black Mt. Blues
He left us a legacy for me and for you.
The sweetest song I heard him sing was with Miss Rosalee
Oh my darlin, my darling, my heart breaks as she takes yer long journey

Now Doc and Willard, Tom and Gaither, Annie and General D
Sure made a lot of music up there that Watson Family
Lets pick up our guitars now come on what ya got to lose
Aint it time we finally learn to play the Deep River Blues

In Deep Gap, North Carolina some folks up there might say
Yes, its a Doc Watson mornin guitar pickin
Cause its a Doc Watson mornin D-18 guitar pickin
Cause its a Doc Watson mornin D-18 guitar pickin kinda day.
