Times are strange seems like nothing lasts
We watch the changes go by so fast
We fear the future, and it makes up long for the past, 
Over my head, I got in too deep 
Weighted down with the promises I could not keep
Between a rock and a hard place no room to be found.
There aint no middle ground
There aint no middle ground 

Everywhere you look some kind of war is going on 
And no mans land is never gonna stay that way for long, 
Better climb off that fence boy, before somebody shoots you down,
Hey, theyre gonna shoot you down, and theyll say
Hey boy, just whos side are you on anyway
Well I havent got the heart to act my part out in their play
But in the end you got no choice, its the only game in town
There aint no middle ground
There aint no middle ground

So hard not to lose yourself along the way
Sometimes you gotta hold your breath and take that magic leap of faith

Last night I dreamed of a long forgotten place, high up on the hill, 
The cool wind in my face
The air was clean and clear and I could see for miles around,
And in my heart I knew I had come home,
And in my soul there was a peace Id never know, 
And so I stake my claim to this sacred place Ive found, 
And I stand the middle ground
I stand the middle ground---Lyrics submitted by Lynn Wolfe.
