Who was and is and is to come
The Savior, Redeemer the Father the Son
His Spirit is on me a fire within
Creator, Sustainer, Beginning and End

The Great I Am, the Great I Am
The Great I Am, the Great I Am
The Great I Am, the Great I Am
The Great I Am, the Great I Am

You are everything I will ever need
To complete every thing You are asking of me
I lay it all down for the sake of Your Name
Here I am God, use me, set me aflame

The Great I Am, the Great I Am
The Great I Am, the Great I Am
The Great I Am, the Great I Am
The Great I Am, the Great I Am

You are dancing and singing the Father's song
You are dancing and singing the Father's song
You are dancing and singing the Father's song
You're rejoicing over me

You are a good, good Daddy
You are a good, good Daddy
You are a good, good Daddy
You're rejoicing over me
You're rejoicing over me---Lyrics submitted by tumelo molefe.
