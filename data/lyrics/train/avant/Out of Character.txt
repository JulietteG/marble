Out of Character

Ah, baby Im tired, I need to catch up on some rest
A lot of working
Alright, good night

Listen, tonight I want to do a little something different on you, you know
If thats alright with you
Dont be scared baby

Its bigger than shorty
Anything you experience 
I need you to be spontaneous,
Tonight youre going to get out of character

Its nothing that well do all the time
But, baby this fantasy is mine
You said you try anything once for me
And this is the one that I really need
The way I feel about you want change
And Im not trying to make you go both ways
But tonight you need to go both ways, for me baby
Oh, oh

Its bigger than shorty
Anything you experience 
I need you to be spontaneous, for me
Tonight youre going to get out of character

I want to experiment shorty
Take you places you never been, aw girl
Let me introduce you to another woman
Tonight youre going to get out of character

Well go out to eat, the tabs mine, I got that
Thats where you can meet and unwind
I want to make sure youre comfortable
Cause we done talked about this once before
Your smile is telling me, have my trust
Girl its plus, were both curious
You, me, and she can get it all done
Cause tonight well be as one

Its bigger than shorty
Anything you experience 
I need you to be spontaneous, for me
Tonight youre going to get out of character

I want to experiment shorty
Take you places you never been, oh
Let me introduce you to another woman
Tonight youre going to get out of character

Lie down; let us caress your body
Baby its metaphysical
We can start in the bed and end up on the floor
Its bigger than shorty
Anything you experience 
I need you to be spontaneous, for me
Tonight youre going to get out of character

I want to experiment shorty
Take you places you never been
Let me introduce you to another woman
Tonight youre going to get out of character---Lyrics submitted by Yolanda.
