Hey...

Yeah, Yeah.

I wanna know
Can we spend this life together
Be a shield from rainy weather
Tell me can I
Baby tell me can I be your man?

Let's be lovers
(Malik) I promise to be faithful
True and honest, yeah, forever
I know you've been hurt
But you really need to give us a chance

You need love
Please don't change the way you are
Soon, you'll live within my heart
You deserve it, you know it
You've been searchin' for it all of your life

You need love
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon my chest
And I'll hold you, I'll save you
You've been searchin' for it all of your life
(You need love, need love)

I need to know
Can I be the one you trust
Be your friend I'll give you all,
All of the things you dream of
Tell me can I be your man?

Oh, in your heart
There's a wound I wanna heal
If you're willing I'll be here
Here to fix the broken
Let me change the life you live

You need love
Please don't change the way you are
Soon, you'll live within my heart
You deserve it, you know it
You've been searchin' for it all of your life

You need love
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon my chest
And I'll hold you, I'll save you
You've been searchin' for it all of your life
(You need love, need love)

You've been searchin' for it all of your life
Yeah.
(You need love, need love)
You've been searchin' for it all of your life!
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You need love, need love
Don't change the way you are.
You need love
Searchin' for it all of your life

You need love
Please don't change the way you are
Soon, you'll live within my heart
You deserve it, you know it
You've been searchin' for it all of your life

You need love
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon my chest
And I'll hold you, I'll save you
You've been searchin' for it all of your life

You need love
Please don't change the way you are
Soon, you'll live within my heart
You deserve it, you know it
You've been searchin' for it all of your life

You need love
Don't be scared to try again
You can rest upon my chest
And I'll hold you, I'll save you
You've been searchin' for it all of your life
