First off I cant keep a promise
I'm no one to count on at all
Add on that I'm a coward
Too scared to return your calls

[Chorus]
But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger
Lalala
Cuz you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
Lalala

Its known that I'm a liar
Often they're blacker than white
Add on my uncanny ego
No ones less humbled than I

[Chorus]
But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger
Lalala
Cuz you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
Lalala

All the messed up things I do
Yeah I swear I'll make'em up to you
Before you go and have enough
Just let me make it better
I'll try to measure up
I'll try to measure up to you

I'll make it up to you

[Chorus]
But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger
Lalala
Cuz you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
Lalala---Lyrics submitted by Trisha Lynn.
