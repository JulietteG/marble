You might be the favorite part of me
Your my season, Summer, Autumn, Spring
I won't go back, you'll get all of me, oh
I'll come running when you call on me
Over mountains, underneath the sea
Bet you bottom dollar I will be here
I'm going through pictures of phone of you
I can't wait to get home to you

Good morning to you baby
When I fall, I fall in love with you

I'm watching you sprout right in front of me
Wonder what your life will come to be
When you look back I will be behind you
And when I'm old I pray that you will find
Daddy left you all you needed
I love you with my soul, now baby you go
Oh, I hate being gone from you
Caught a red eye to get home to you
So I could say...

Let the horns play
Horns play
For KBJ
All my fathers can relate
Let the horns play
I'm going through pictures of my phone of you
I can't wait to get home to you---
