I don't know if, you know this
But beautiful things don't need attention
All that posting, bossin'
You voguein', I notice
You'll do anything to get a mention
You fakin', already know you fakin'
Men wanna bring a model home
They got no interior just decorations
(Tell me why you want that?)
You way too empty to be beautiful
That's why these men they makin' new to you
To the bait you used to fish you catch
Is you that? Are you an ornament?
Goin' back to the basement when he said, "Enough"
A trophy on the wall again
Don't wanna be lonely, but on this arm again
But he's still raisin' up his arm again
That's why I'm callin' him, because it all came in

She remembers life as prom queen
Dating the captain of the team
She continues, the star of the venue
She know life don't sell you dreams
But people do, but people do
But you gotta find your way
But people do
But you gotta find your way

Look too small, too short, too tall
Not big enough, thick enough
Pen to the fall, they'll change it all
Everything before was wrong
Girl, you can keep her
Just leave it all
Look, you'll be fine
Spend your life tryna be a ten
When that ten ain't worth a dime
They can teach you to catch his eye
I'ma teach you to catch his heart
Cause if you catch his heart you will always have his eye
But you'll always be a bride
You will always be desired
You're a masterpiece
Not a piece to be mastered, your master
You will not decide, your the Master's piece
That makes you flawless, flawless
Regardless, you're a loved woman
Who taught you to hate your skin?
Who taught you to hate your lips?
Who taught you, huh?
Who saw you and made you live?
Who sought you and made you His?

You got it
If don't nobody else tell you
You got it, you got it, you got it
If don't nobody else tell you
(You gotta find your way)
If don't nobody else tell you
It's all a dream

See, never put God after another man
Or another man will become your God and God will be another man
Think like a woman, act like a woman that's beautiful
You're our Eve not because you're connected to Adam's holiday Your fantasy of being noticed is already a reality
Wake up---
