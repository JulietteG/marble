Now I'm your big mal dropper, mud duck stopper
Fila on the bottom and Adidas on the topper
Transform scratchin', big beat mackin'
I can tell you're getting jealous by the looks I'm catchin'
I hate dumb skeezers, MC beater
Drop 5 grand on my bird white needer
Smooth like ice, don't get nice
Just turn up the box for the Mix-A-Lot slice 
Y'all ready to get busy? (whoo hoo!)
Now, buttermilk biscuits here we go
SIFT the flour roll the dough
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Move your butt to the funky beat (huh huh)
Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)
(Lord have mercy Mix-A-Lot got me rappin' about biscuits now)
We're from L.A. to the Carolinas
Dip them suckers in Aunt Jemima
Don't make a difference what food you make
Use buttermilk biscuits to clean your plate
You eat 'em in the morn', you eat 'em at night
Kentucky Fried Chicken makes the suckers just right
I am eat 'em with jelly at my favorite deli
Wrapped and sealed by a freak named Shelley 
Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)
One day I kissed my freak, hit the street
Looking for something to eat
In a 18-wheeler, lookin' real swass
All the girls smile 'cause I'm the big boss
Said I gotta eat now, can't eat later
Made a lot of noise to attract my waiter
The boy walked up, and what did he say?
Say, buttermilk biscuits free today!
Wha what you waitin' on boy, get up shake a leg
Gimme 10 of them suckers with grits and eggs
 glass of Koolaid and a whole stick of butter
Them biscuits make me a superfast cutter (whoo hoo)
Now grab that can and wrap it in your hand
Bang that sucker till THE DOUGH EXPANDS
PUT them suckers off in your oven
Grab your girlie and get a little lovin'
Add a dab of honey if you want to get funny
Microwave the suckers if you want your honey runny
KINDA get naughty at the Mix-A-Lot party
And rub them suckers all over your body (whoo hoo)---Lyrics submitted by Cindy.
