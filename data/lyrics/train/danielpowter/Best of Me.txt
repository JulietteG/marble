I was made the wrong way
won't you do me the right way
where you gonna be tonight
'cause I won't stay too long
maybe you're the light for me
when you talk to me it strikes me
won't somebody help me?
'cause I don't feel too strong
Was it something that I said
was it something that I did
or the combination of both that did me wrong
You know I'm hoping you sing along
I know it's not your favorite song
don't wanna be there when there's nothing left to say 

you know that some of us spin again
when you do, you need a friend
don't wanna be there when there's nothing left for me
and I hate to thought of finally being erased
baby that's the best of me 
Everything's behind you
but the hope still stands beside you
living in every moment
have I wasted all your time
Was there something that I said
was there something that I did
or the combination I broke that did me have
You know I'm hoping you sing along
I know it's not your favourite song
don't wanna be there when there's nothing left to say
you know that some of us spin again
when you do, you need a friend 
don't wanna be there when there's nothing left for me
and I hate to thought of finally being erased
baby that's the best of me
baby that's the best of me
You know I'm hoping you sing along
I know it's not your favorite song
don't wanna be there when there's nothing left to say
you know that some of us spin again
when you do, you need a friend
don't wanna be there when there's nothing left for me
and I hate to thought of finally being erased
baby that's the best of me---Lyrics submitted by Axcell.
