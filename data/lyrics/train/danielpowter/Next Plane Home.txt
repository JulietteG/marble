I woke up early to baby blue eyes from the afar whoah whoah
and when the sun comes through and lights you like the angel you are whoah whoah
I know I do you wrong when Im with you Ive been gone

With every season change, it looks the same (november to june) whoah whoah
And dont these empty streets skip a beat the flowers dont bloom whoah whoah

I cant believe I missed your birthday again
and I wanna come back but I just dont know when now

And Im so lonely your not here with me
Thats why Im gonna be on the next plane home

The road that never ends around the bend I see your smile whoah whoah
Id swim across the sea to be with you for a while whoah whoah
cos Im made a life would be gone
now the way that I feel I just dont belong

And Im so lonely youre not here with me
thats why Im gonna be on the next plane home
And youre youre the only face I wanna see
thats why Im gonna be on the next plane home

Stand around try to make every moment
and be somebody yeah anybody
it seems the whole world is taking me over
I need somebody to help me get back to it

and Ive always been a million miles away
but things are gonna change
I just wanna come home

And youre youre the only face I wanna see
thats why I gonna be on the next plane home
yeah Im taking the next plane home
Now Im getting the next plane home
Now Im taking the next plane home---Lyrics submitted by Alison.
