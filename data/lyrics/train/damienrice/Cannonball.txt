There's still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
It's still a little harder to say what's going on

There's till a little bit of your ghost, your weakness
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
You step a little closer each day
That I cant say what's going on

Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to lie
Life, it taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannonball

There's still a little bit of your song in my ear
There's still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You step a little closer to me
So close that I can't see what's going on

And stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to lie
Life, taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon

Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to cry
So come on courage
Teach me to be shy
'Cause it's not hard to fall

And I don't wanna scare her
It's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna lose
It's not hard to grow
When you know that you're just don't know---
