I gave me away
I could have knocked off the evening
But I lonelily landed my wants in her hands
In a way, I felt you were leaving me
I was sure I wouldn't find you at home

And you let me down
You could've knocked off the evening
But you lonelily let him push under your bone
You let me down
It's no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone

And you're coming home
You're coming home
And you're coming home
You're coming home

I gave me away
I could've knocked off the evening
But I was lonelily looking for someone to hold
In a way, I lost all I believed in
And I never found myself so alone

And you let me down
You couldve called if youd needed
But you lonelily got yourself locked in instead
You let me down
But it's one thing you cheated
But you took him all the way through your bed

And now you're coming home
And Im trying to forgive ,you're coming home
And Im trying to forget, youre coming home
And Im trying to move on, youre coming home
And you haven't called yet, you're coming home
And Im trying to forgive, you're coming home
Just trying to forget, you're coming home
And trying to move on, you're coming home
But you havent called
Ahh coming home
Youre coming home
Youre coming home
Youre coming home

I gave me away
I could've knocked off the evening
But I lonelily loomed into my bone
You let me down
Theres no use deceiving
Neither of us wanna be alone---Lyrics submitted by Annie.
