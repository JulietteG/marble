There was no room within the inn
When they came to Bethlehem
In a stable a baby came
Little Jesus was His name

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 little fingers on His hand
Son of God, Mary's little man
Born in a manger, gentle as a lamb
My heart's in the five little fingers of his hand

Jesus came to save the world
Man and woman, boy and girl
Bow before Him, give Him praise
For His goodness, count the ways

Repeat Chorus
