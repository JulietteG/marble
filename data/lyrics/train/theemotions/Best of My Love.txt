Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never, never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery

Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
I like the way ya make me about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see

Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love

Goin' in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way

Oooooooh, yea (my love, my love)
Oooooooh, yea (my love, my love)

Oh, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love

Demonstrating sweet love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
The way I feel about ya, baby
Can't explain it
Want the whole wide world to see

Oooooooh, but in my heart
You're all I need
You for me and me for you
Oooooooh, it's growin' every day
Oooooooh

Ooooooooh, oh oh oh oh oh
You've got the best of my love
Ooooooooh, oh oh oh oh oh
You've got the best of my love
Ooooooooh, givin' you the best of my love
My love
Ooooooooh, my love
Oooooooh, givin' you the best of my love
My love oooooooh, oh yeah
Oooooooh, oh oh oh oh oh
You've got the best of my love---
