Yeah ole
what's going on sir? x5
we're no victorians we are of a brand new age
we live victorious oh honey I'm feeling great (na na na na)
see the war's behind us (la la la la)
we don't want that shit (la la la la)
so please don't reminds us oh honey I'm feeling rich
what you saying now

express your surrealism (woof)
it works best if you feel different (yeah) 
we don't jest this is real living 
and our livin gone rid us of limits so (bring it) 
they call these years crazy (wow)
it's all love here lately (dance)
i wanna dance with that flapper named stacy
her daddy might hate me
but we should make babies (it's fun)
do the charleston (break away) 
she's had people on her arms since she (came to play)
and we all wanna charm her with (material ways) 
are we lost? should our generation (take the blame)
it's just fun and we're going to die when we're (40)
right now we're driven wild by the talkies 
still unlikely to cause grief (right on the 4th beat)
can you come and jive on the floor please

(chorus) 
we're no victorians we are of a brand new age
we live victorious oh honey I'm feeling great (na na na na)
see the war's behind us (la la la la)
we don't want that shit (la la la la)
so please don't reminds us oh honey I'm feeling rich
what you saying now

jive, jive, jive ,jive
honey honey
jive, jive , jive , jive
what you saying man
put your dancing feet on 
come and move with me
and we'll jive, jive, jive, jive

hell yes
we're less rigid, with legs spinning
and well dressed women and get given 
an opportunity to tell them that we dont give a (daffy duck)
chilling in the jazzy club, yeah there's a big bag of us
and i aint saying that we're finished when we (wrap it up) 
and i aint feeling that we're sinning with the (magic dust) 
we're just keeping to the rhythm with some stamina 
la la la la

what's going on sir
if your trying to do the (waltz that's the wrong turn) 
and if your looking for a (chick that's the wrong bird)
I've already seen her (hips and i want her) 
pronte i go from NYC to (midnight in Paris)
there's nine years for this type of madness 
madness might lead to marriage (which might lead to baby in a carriage)
so maybe we could manage to jive

(chorus)
we're no victorians we are of a brand new age
we live victorious oh honey I'm feeling great (na na na na)
see the war's behind us (la la la la)
we don't want that shit (la la la la)
so please don't reminds us oh honey I'm feeling rich
what you saying now

jive, jive, jive, jive
honey honey
jive, jive, jive , jive
yeah, what you saying man
put your dancing feet up
come and move with me
and we'll jive jive jive jive---Lyrics submitted by Kayley may Welf.
