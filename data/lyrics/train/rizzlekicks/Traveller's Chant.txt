Last week, I was passenger on a car seat
Thinking of decision that I made within a heart beat! 
She used to make my heartbeat but usually alarms me my lungs are over
Working and I [cant breathe]
Yes I convinced myself I don't like relationship malarkey, 
And she's says wait, you didn't ask me... [How I felt! ] 
I said I love that your a [nice girl], and I'm sorry 
But this really Wasn't time well, 
And it kinda feels like it may be a blur, 
Maybe coffee and telly is what I mainly prefer, 
Feel I gotta scratch the surface gotta break it to learn, 
And now I multiply the times in which the tables have turned! 

I call this the traveller's Chant! 
Whether you sitting on a train or in the back of a car, 
Thinking, Maybe it's me, Yes I do have places to be; 
And I'll be there, 
Do I start at the end or do I end at the start, 
And in this little bit of time will I get very far? 
Maybe it's me? Yes I do have places to be! 
And I'll be there! 

Yes, yeah the other day I was sitting on the train but in another place, 
I was on my way home, or maybe some would say, 
I was thinking bout the days I wanna run away, 
I've only really gotta couple mates, Me, myself and I, How CLICHE, 
Looking out the window, feels like I'm in a film, 
Director producer and as it happens I'm the main [character], 
Yeah my own little feature, length sound track being
What ever's in my speakers [Then], 
I'd rather not be held accountable I bank on peoples feelings
It's no wonder why I'm feeling spent, yeah and in a deeper sense, 
Sometimes I need the rain it helps me kinda clean my head, 
The suns an easy friend, I'm thinking maybe the duration of my journey
Helped me reconnect my feelings then! 

I call this the traveller's Chant! 
Whether you sitting on a train or in the back of a car, 
Thinking, Maybe it's me, Yes I do have places to be; 
Do I start at the end or do I end at the start, 
In this little bit of time will I get very far? 
Maybe it's me? Yes I do have places to be! 
And I'll be there! 

[Oooaah oooah woaaah]{Repeated}

Oh yeah... Yeah, I'll be there, I got places to be and yes! [I'll be
There! ] Yeah, Uh, Yeah, I'll be there... Said I'll be there, [And I'll be
There! ]
