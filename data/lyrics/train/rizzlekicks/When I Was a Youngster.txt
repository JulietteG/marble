I can remember that when I was a little youth I,
Wanted to fly around the world making a new life,
I never thought today, I'd be what I am now,

Yo, wanted to be a fireman,
Than I lost the desire man,
The second I got old enough,
To buy myself a cider can,
Yeah, I was a smart little kid,
That side's departed me since,
These days you can catch me,
Sitting on the bench in the park with a lager and crisps

Back when I was younger,
I wanted to be everything on the planet,
Now that I am older,
It seems the ambition has vanished,
Yeah when I was a youngster,
When I was a, when I was a youngster,
Youngster, when I was a youngster
Yeah, and now that I'm older,
I wish I could've been everything that I wanted,
I'm on it

I think that if I think back back to the days
When I thought I didn't think that,
Nothing that I thought would not be possible,
Ha, try and figure that out,
Back when I didn't know how,
To settle for a desk job bring in those pounds,
I wanted to live in those clouds,
These days I deliver those sounds

I always thought of myself as a simple dreamer,
I never tried too hard but believed it,
Now all of a sudden, it's gone my way

Back when I was younger,
I wanted to be everything on the planet,
Now that I am older,
It seems the ambition has vanished,
Yeah when I was a youngster,
When I was a, when I was a youngster,
Youngster, when I was a youngster
Yeah, and now that I'm older,
I wish I could've been everything that I wanted,
I'm on it
