Sitting by the old road again.
Waiting for a letter for a friend.
Thinking about the old days again.
Drifting down the river with no end.

But the life I see, tells me nothing is wrong with me.
But the life I see, tells me nothing is wrong with me.

Passing by the cave on the cove.
Standing in the darkness in the sun.
Open up the window to your mind.
So I can look inside and lend a hand.

But the life I see, tells me nothing is wrong with me.
But the life I see, tells me nothing is wrong with me.

Am I the one eyed king amongst the blind?
Can I heal the wounds that leave behind?
Let me be the savior in your life.
For the army and the potions I can buy.---Lyrics submitted by Vincent Hayward.
