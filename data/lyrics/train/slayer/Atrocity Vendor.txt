You're staring at the atrocity vendor
a fucking equal oppurtunity offender
I've got the plan that's gonna change this world
stand back and watch the seeds of hate unfold

I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, sever every part of you
Light you up with kerosene, watch you burn, watch you bleed
I am torture unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes
hell yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels
violence pulses in my veins, death forever reigns

This is more than just my endless rapture
I'll fucking guarantee of your impending disaster
A socio-path with my thawable control 
aggregate of terror watch the seeds of death unfold

I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, sever every part of you
Reeking of his breath, It's a new fucking nightmare
I am torture unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes
hell yes, agony is real,I can show you how it feels
violence pulses in my veins, death forever reigns

You're staring at the atrocity vendor
a mother fucking equal oppurtunity offender
I'll introduce you to my own morbid charm
and fist fuck you with your own severed arms

I'll never hesitate to break you, rape you, torture every part of you
Criss-cross, terrorize, personal genocide 
I am evil unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes
hell yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels

violence pulses in my veins, death forever
death forever reigns---Lyrics submitted by first.
