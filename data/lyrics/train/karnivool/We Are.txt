I know there's something wrong stop making it up
We're too proud to see we've lost more than our trust
And now there's nothing left, well's dead and dried up
Its disease has left a foul taste in our cup

It just keeps on flowing
And we drift on knowing
It just keeps on flowing
This babble from our mouth

Who we are I fear most of the time
Carry on shuffling in order and in line
Who we are I fear most of the time
Carry on whipping boy, stare into the light
Stare into the light
And it feels familiar for good reason

I want us to break the case we're in
With one of the tools of this catatonic skin
Remove all the parts
I want us to face the shape we're in
A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin
Lets reset it all
Lets reset it all

Well it stings and it hurts, is this how it's meant to be
Well it stings and it hurts, is this how it's meant to be
Well it stings and it hurts, a small price to pay to be
In control and rebirth what our future's meant to be

Who we are I fear most of the time
So carry on whipping boy, stare into the light
I want us to face the shape we're in
A world of confusion awaits our sons and kin
Let's reset it all (We are, we are, we are)
Let's reset it all (We are, we are, we are)

These words of wisdom come with lack of vision
(We are, we are, we are)
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision
(We are, we are, we are)
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness
These words of wisdom come with lack of vision
This is the first day I've ever had to stand and witness---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
