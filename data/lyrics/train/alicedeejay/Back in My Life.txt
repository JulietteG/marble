Want you back in my life,

I want you back in my life..want you back by my side,
'Cause thats where you belong,
Oh and I..I won't give you up..I will never stop,
My love is much to strong,

I want you back in my life..want you back by my side,
'Cause thats where you belong,
Oh and I..I won't give you up..I will never stop,
My love is much to strong,

Look at me standing here,
Crying out my final tears,
Look at me in the rain,
All that i won't name again,

Look at me standing here,
Crying out my final tears,
Look at me in the rain,
All that i won't name again,

Remember when you told me,
You didnt want anybody else but me,
And I'm that same girl,
That's all you need to see,

I want you back in my life..want you back by my side,
'Cause thats where you belong,
Oh and I..I won't give you up..I will never stop,
My love is much to strong,

Look at me standing here,
Crying out my final tears,
Look at me in the rain,
All that i won't name again!!---Lyrics submitted by karen.
