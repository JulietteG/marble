I'm sitting down and staring into space
I know what's coming next you've got that look upon your face
What cheap excuses will you make
It might be the weather
I bend and bend but I don't break 
but never say never

Whats that you said you're leaving me?
I didn't hear you
You're acting like you're on TV
All this screaming dramatising
I'm the one who should be crying
What's that you said you needed me?

It's true to say I've heard it all before
You leave today
tomorrow you'll be crawling back for me
I know deep down you'll never change
I've only got myself to blame
it's to picture us together - but then again
Never say never

Chorus

When will we let go
Will our love survive
or have we expired
