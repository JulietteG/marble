I saw your face light up the room
Like a flower in full bloom
I never felt so shy - or such a natural high
I wondered what I'd say to you
Convinced that I would fall - but a smile says it all
The day I fell in love with you

You ran and kissed me from the bus
No one existed only us
A magical goodbye, a wish for time to fly
The day I fell in love with you

Flying kites on Bolbury Down
Autumn leaves already brown
The perfect morning view, a breakfast made for two
The day I fell in love with you
Until the sun gets cold, until the stars grow old
The day I fell in love with you

Feels like forever since you called
The snowflakes settle on the wall
A phone begins to ring, my heart begins to sing
the day I fell in love with you
I knew that I'd have you - so shiny and brand new
The day I fell in love with you
Until the sun gets cold, until the stars grow old
The day I fell in love with you
You whisper in my ear, the words I long to hear
The day I fell in love with you---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
