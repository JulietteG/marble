Ive been where you are
Ascending to dizzy heights
Ive seen how the stars
Can light up the darkest nights

Flew too close to the sun
Before Id become
What cant be undone

I know how the sky
Makes you believe anything
Ive flown where you fly
Thought Id grown angels wings

Flew too close to the sun
Before Id become
What cant be undone

Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down

Ive been where you are
Ascending to dizzy heights
Ive seen how the stars
Can light up the darkest night

Flew too close to the sun
Before Id become
What cant be undone

Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down (put your fingers in the fire)
Burn it down ---
