 I have loved you for a long, long time my love
Please don't walk away
Don't leave me high don't try
You're all I think of when I'm all alone
Can you explain to me where we went wrong
How can you say that you love me, yet hurt me this way?

Don't make me cry, don't say it's over
Don't make me waste another day
Don't say you're leaving me
I don't want it to end this way, oh

Time will heal the pain of our goodbye, I know
But, I will love you 'til the day I die, I'm sure
Just try to remember the moments we shared
We promised each other we'd always be there
What have we done to our dreams, how can this be ?

Don't make me cry, don't say it's over
Don't make me waste another day
Don't say you're leaving me
I don't want it to end this way

Don't make me cry, don't say it's over
Don't make me cry, don't walk away
Don't say you're leaving me
I don't want it to ever change

Baby give me another chance
I know we can make it
I love you, you love me
That much we know you know
Tell me why it's so hard to go, don't let go

Don't make me cry, don't say it's over
Don't make me waste another day
Don't say you're leaving me
I don't want it to end this way

Don't make me cry, don't say it's over
Don't make me waste another day
Don't say you're leaving me, oh
I don't want it to ever change, no

Don't let go
Don't let it end this way, no, no, no
Don't let go
Don't let go---Lyrics submitted by Lon Eva Carlos.
