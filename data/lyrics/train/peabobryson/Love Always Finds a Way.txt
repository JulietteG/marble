We've said it all
a thousand times before
been to the wall
and always found somewhere to turn
there was always room to learn

We've reached the end
and almost closed the door
and someone went in
I never can remember who
All I know is that
we found the strength to make it through

CHORUS:
Love always finds a way
when the clouds have no silver lining
He comes through shining
Love always sees the light
through the darkest night 
in a small way
Love always finds a way

Holding you near
After the storm has passed
It becomes clear
when all our tears have finally dried
that no matter how
we fools may try to turn the tide

REPEAT CHORUS

And when those moments
when the magic seems to fade
We must remember then
that's the time to keep on believing
and not be afraid

If we both trust
in what we really feel
The two of us
can hold tomorrow in our hands
all it takes is just
the faith to truly understand

REPEAT CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by jaffer.
