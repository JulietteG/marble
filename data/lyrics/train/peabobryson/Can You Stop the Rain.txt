Ooh, ooh, ooh, girl

Here's another morning without you
Here's another day, will I get through
Without breaking down

Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on
Baby, I've been living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days, they're all here inside

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day, baby, can you stop
Can you stop the rain? Oh, oh

Everywhere I go I feel you there
Following my footsteps like a shadow
Of my broken heart

Sometimes it's a pair of passing eyes
Or it's just the way someone is talking
And there you are

Am I all alone
Don't you ever wake up and reach for me
Where I used to be
Is there any chance
I just can't believe you're not lonely too
Just for me and you

Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears from falling
I can't face another day, baby, can you stop
Can you stop the rain? Oh, oh

If you are here for only one night
Baby, I know you remember
'Cause loving you once wasn't time enough
I know we can make it together, together

Baby, stop the rain
Won't you chase my clouds away
I'd give anything to see the sun again
Only you can stop these tears of mine from falling
I can't face another day, baby, can you stop
Can you, can you stop the rain

Can you stop the rain? Yeah
How can I live without you, baby?
How can I let you go? Yeah
Chase my clouds away, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Victor.
