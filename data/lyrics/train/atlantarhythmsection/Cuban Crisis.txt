CUBAN CRISIS
ATLANTA RHYTHM SECTION
From the Album: Dog Days


INSTRUMENTAL INTRO
Oooh   .   .   .   No es tia Maria conchita man, ye-ah !

All week long Im a-workin like a son-of-a-gun
And when the weekend comes I wanna have some fun
I drank all the wine in Tampa last night and most of the beer
And I woke up with a dark-eyed woman
What am I doin here?

CHORUS
Its another Cuban crisis 
Margarita, youre a hell of a sight 
Its another Cuban crisis 
Ybor City on a Saturday night
Feeling alright

Whoa last thing I remember shes singing Cuban Songs
And you shoulda heard this craker singin along
Right now my head is achin, Whoa oh oh, never again
Oh, Margarita, Margarita, what have you got me in? 

CHORUS
Its another Cuban crisis
Monday mornin itll be alright
Its another Cuban crisis 
Ybor City on a Saturday night
Feeling alright

INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE (then)
Ooh la la la la la .   .   .

All week long Im a-workin like a son-of-a-gun
And when the weekend comes I wanna have some fun
I drank all the wine in Tampa last night and most of the beer
And I woke up with a dark-eyed woman, What am I doin here?

CHORUS
Its another Cuban crisis 
Ybor City on a Saturday night
Its another Cuban crisis 
Margarita, youre a hell of a sight 
Its another Cuban crisis 
Everythings gonna be alright
Its another Cuban crisis 
Ybor City on a Saturday night---Lyrics submitted by William Eudy.
