When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not get your eyes
Now I stand here helplessly
Hoping you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else
I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else
Thinkin' how it's gonna be
Whenever I get you next to me

It's gonna be good
Don't you know
From your head to toe
Gonna love you all over
Over and over
Me into you, you into me
Me into you

I'm so into you
I'm so into you...

When you walked into the room
There was voodoo in the vibes
I was captured by your style
But I could not get your eyes
Now I stand here helplessly
Hopin' you'll get into me

I am so into you
I can't get to nothing else
I am so into you, baby
I can't get to nothing else, no, no, no
Come on baby
I'm so into you
Love the things you do
Listen, baby
You're driving me crazy
Come on baby
I'm so into you
Love the things you do---Lyrics submitted by Fori Mathys.
