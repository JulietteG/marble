Everything should be fine
You'll find things tend to stand in line
It's but a link in time
But I'm sure you'll let me try

No one is sitting on fire
So long we're waiting on by

Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times, I sang
Your loss wasn't mine
Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times, I sang
Your loss wasn't mine

In your mind
Open ...
In your mind
I will open ...
I will open ...

No one is sitting on fire
So long we're waiting on ...
Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind

You loved the times
I sang your loss wasn't mine
Who laid a line?
Say you're like my kind
You loved the times
I sang your loss wasn't mine---
