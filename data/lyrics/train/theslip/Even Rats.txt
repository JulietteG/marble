Even the rats know the troubles gonna come 
To the edge of the city see the little guys run 
I hear spring is nice in Canada 

Maybe the men up on capitol hill 
Meed a little less Jack and a little more Jill 
You can have my stereo 

Even though the race may never be won 
I can lay like a dandy get heady in the sun 
Take a love song and beautify 

(whoah) 

I hear the words but the meaning gets lost 
It's a game, that depends on who the ball gets tossed 
It's the same ball anyway 

You're tuggin' me know cut me loose or take me on 
You can play, you can pay the piper all night long 
That's some good home cookin' 

even though the race may never be won 
I can lay like a dandy get heady in the sun 
take a love song and beautify 

(whoah)

**alternate line in second verse: 

if you can hear me now 
then you're halfway there 
just a jump from your window 
fly naked through the air
Take a long hard look---Lyrics submitted by Faiz.
