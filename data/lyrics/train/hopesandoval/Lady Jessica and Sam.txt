You've got a lot of feelings,
that keep your hands and treasures, warm

I came around to see you 
and found the house away, in storm

Stayed by the river cold
and talked in all the ways you, know

Hung all my thoughts from view
just like the feelings, do

Your father in his memories,
they had a race in your heart.

your mother seems so faithless
she had the way to tear apart.

Stayed by the river cold
and talked in all the ways i
know

Hung all my thoughts from view
just like your feelings 
do

baby son
he took your hand
to let you know
it's time to go

doodoodoodoodoo

and baby son
he took your hand
to let you know
it's time to go---Lyrics submitted by lid.
