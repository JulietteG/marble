In and out of situations / That tug-a-war at me / All day long I struggle For answers that I need / Then I come into His presence / All my questions become clear And for a sacred moment / No doubt can interfere.

Chorus: In the presence of Jehovah / God Almighty Prince of Peace / Trouble vanish hearts are mended in the presence of the King

Through His love the Lord provided / A place for us to rest / A place to find the answers / In hours of distress / There is never any reason / To give up in despair / Just slip away and breathe His name / He will come and meet you there.

Chorus: In the presence of Jehovah / God Almighty Prince of Peace / Trouble vanish hearts are mended in the presence of the King ---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
