I could have fortune and fame
go anywhere do anything but 
Oh God, I just want you

I could search for earthly thing's,
to satisfy my every need
Oh God, i just want you

I just want you, I just want you
I just want to live in your presence everyday
I lay down my will and every selfish desire
whatever it takes, 
father thats what i'll do
cause I just want you

Standing in this holy place
im only here to seek you face Oh God,
I just want you

Can you feel the passion in my heart 
to be close to where you are 
Oh God, I just want you

  ''Repeat Chorus'' 

I just want you, I just want you 
I just want to live in your presence everyday
I lay down my will and every selfish desire 
what ever it takes father that's what i'll do---Lyrics submitted by ANGEL.
