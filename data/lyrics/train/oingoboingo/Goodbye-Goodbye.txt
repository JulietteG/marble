one day i meet jesus and he helps me understand
life on earht without him makes me lonely, makes me scared
he change my life completely
change my darkness into day, he poure hie grace upon me 
and he told me to follow him follow him and obey

 chorus

goodbye goodbye its hard to say oodbye
my old dreams and desire i lift  behind 
jesus give me another  way  to live . 
goodbye old self.---Lyrics submitted by ryan.
