I really need to see her tonight
I made the reservation for two
Going over in my head how to make her mine
She's crying 'cause she feels confused

Maybe she needs some space
Just a little time alone
Please tell me face to face

Now our seven years are gone
How could this be

She was supposed to be the one
How could she

You've already broken my heart
I'd like to keep at least one piece
You can take all that you want
But you're gonna have to share it with me

Share it with me
Share it with me

Share it with me
Just one piece

I never thought that it'd come to this
Never in a million years
The memory of our first kiss
Is taking me to the verge of tears

How can I move on
You were everything to me

So where did we go wrong
This is a tragedy

Tears fall to the ground when I think about
How life goes on without you now
You broke my heart on bended knee
Now that you're gone it's killing me

I am alone without you
Never wanted to say that we're through
Give me your love again
I won't believe this is the end---Lyrics submitted by megan.
