Ugly people put ur hands down
(Chorus)
U wanna throw down, g'on put hands up
Start the party now, g'on put ur hands up
This is a stickup, yo, I didn't hiccup or stutter
It's like butter yall
G'on put ur hands up

U wanna throw down, g'on put hands up
Start the party now, g'on put ur hands up
There's nothing wrong with getting ur party on
C'mon C'mon C'mon and g'on put ur hands up


Step 1
Listen up loud and clear

Because we got a little something to put n ur ear
I know you came to have a good time so kick off your shoes and relax ur 
mind
Now put on your other shoes to make you dance
Cause if you don't you might never get the chance

Step 2
Raise those arms off your sides
Yeah you got it. Now stick em up in the sky
Uh oh uh oh
Just throw em over ur shoulder
Uh oh uh oh
If ur young or if ur older
Uh oh uh oh
Cause youse a high roller
Ugly people put ur hands down

(Chorus)

U wanna throw down, g'on put hands up
Start the party now, g'on put ur hands up
This is a stickup, yo, I didn't hiccup or stutter
It's like butter yall
G'on put ur hands up
U wanna throw down, g'on put hands up
Start the party now, g'on put ur hands up
There's nothing wrong with getting ur party on
C'mon C'mon C'mon and g'on put ur hands up

Step 4
Did you get left behind because if you did we gonna press rewind
I have feeling
We should be dealing
With the fact sweat's dripping from the ceiling
It's a fact, Step 3 is so whack (record scratch)
Sike

Now Flip the track back Jack

Uh oh uh oh
Just throw em over ur shoulder
Uh oh uh oh
If ur young or if ur older
Uh oh uh oh
Cause youse a high roller
Ugly people put ur hands down

(Chorus)

U wanna throw down, g'on put hands up
Start the party now, g'on put ur hands up
This is a stickup, yo , I didn't hiccup or stutter
It's like butter yall
G'on put ur hands up
U wanna throw down, g'on put hands up
Start the party now, g'on put ur hands up
There's nothing wrong with getting ur party on
C'mon C'mon C'mon and g'on put ur hands up

(Liger Breakdown)

Uh oh uh oh
Just throw em over ur shoulder
Uh oh uh oh

If ur young or if ur older

Uh oh uh oh

Cause youse a high roller

Ugly people put ur hands down
