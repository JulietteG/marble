One sixteen and the fam in the building homie
You know we gotta kill it
Keepin it cataclysmic, chaotic
Calm and cool, and you kiddin, come on

Thats my song
Handle my business
Got my witness
Give it a minute
I promise imma wild out
When I get that feelin
That feelin of pure adrenaline
Spirits fillin me up
Aint no tellin homie when itll end
I know the fire marshall
Gonna be comin around to shut this down
He entered the building
And got his hands up to the ceiling now

Juiced up on faith
Dont play
