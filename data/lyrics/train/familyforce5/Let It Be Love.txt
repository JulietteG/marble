I've never seen a soul set free through an argument
I've never seen a hurt get healed in a protest

But I've seen sinners turned to saints because of grace
It's love, love that lights the way
Love that lights the way

Let it be our arms wide open
Bigger than the words we've spoken
Let it be our heart for the broken
If we're gonna light, light, light the way to You
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
Nothing but love, nothing but love, yeah
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
It's love that lights the way

It's not about the stand we take, but the grace we give
It's not about the name we make, but the life we live

Heard about a King who stepped down, took my place
True Love gave His life away
It's love that lights the way

Let it be our arms wide open
Bigger than the words we've spoken
Let it be our heart for the broken
If we're gonna light, light, light the way to You
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
Nothing but love, nothing but love, yeah
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
It's love that lights the way

Stronger than every fear
Comfort for all the tears
It's where the war is won
And it has overcome
Louder than the loudest sound
Deeper than the deepest doubt
We'll watch the walls fall down
We'll watch the walls fall down

Let it be our arms wide open
Bigger than the words we've spoken
Let it be our heart for the broken
If we're gonna light, light, light the way to You
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
Nothing but love, nothing but love, yeah
Let it be love, let it be love, yeah
It's love that lights the way

It's love that lights the way---
