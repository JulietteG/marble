Fear has taken me 
To a place I shouldn't be 
Pretending not to care 
Seeing is believing now it's here 

Read my face there's a past I can't escape 
Yeah, I keep running 
I keep running away 
Away 

Superhero 
Save my life tonight 
I know You'll be there to fight 
I won't let go 
Bring me in the Light 
Superhero 
Save my life tonight 
Save my life tonight 

The spark is now a flame 
The Fire that You breathed inside of me 
Now there is no doubt 
There will be some knocking down 
And dragging out 

You built me up 
And I'm forever changed 
If I should fall 
I'll just call Your Name 
Your Name 

Superhero 
Save my life tonight 
I know You'll be there to fight 
I won't let go 
Bring me in the Light 
Superhero 
Save my life tonight 
Save my life tonight---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
