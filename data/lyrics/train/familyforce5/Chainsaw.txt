Yeah, they like the way I do this
When I crank it like a (chainsaw)
Yeah, they like the way I do this
When I crank it like a (chainsaw)
Full throttle heavy metal
Set the bar next level
Wasteland gettin' all danky
Soul Glow (chainsaw)
Let it go with them elbows back
Engine smokin' like this track
Shirt's soakin' from all this sweat
Catch my breath (chainsaw)

Now hear me roar
I'm an apex predator
From the sycamores, let's get skeletor
(Chainsaw)
Watch and learn, watch and learn
Get that thang crankin' baby, slash slash burn

Bows to the knees yeah crank it like a chainsaw
Crank it crank it crank it back
Crank it like a chain, crank it like a chainsaw

Fresh flannel shirt, country bumpkin
Lumberjackin your moves, a.k.a. Paul Bunyan
Run yun yun-yun-yun yun-yun-yun yun-yun
I make it run I make it run I make it run run
(Chainsaw)
Drop it drop it drop it down low
Chop it chop chop it chop, here we here we go
Beats so sharp that they're callin' me Jaws
I'm your boss, baby, crank it like a chainsaw

Chained out, head hunter
Cyberpunk yeah I'm a blade runner
Turned up automatic
Full tank, you ain't gotta think about it (chainsaw)
Drop it drop it drop it down low
Chop it chop chop it chop, here we here we go
Vroom vroom and you know it's goin' off
I'm yellin' timber, crank it like a (chainsaw)
