Intro:
Fever's got me sweating and you know I'm burning up

Verse 1:
Hey you, did you turn up the heat
Its getting hotter and Im growing weak
Maybe its because you're standing close to me
I'm coming down with something feverishly

B Verse 1:
I think my bodys in shock
It just don't know what to do
I feel my temperature rising
Past one hundred and two

Fever, fever, fever, fever

Chorus: 
Fever, turning up the heat
Fever, come on and get sick with me 
Gimme what you got 'cause you know it's getting hot
Fever, I'm turning flush
Fever, I'm burning up 
Fever's got me sweating and you know I'm burning up

yeah,woaah,yeah,woaah.

Verse 2:
Fever's got this thing that I just can't shake
I tried to sweat it out but it would not break
My heart has taken all the heat that it can take
Just let it burn me up for heaven's sake

Verse 2: 
Hot,Hot to the touch
To the nth degree
Thermometer's reading
About infinity

Fever, fever, fever, fever

(Chorus)

Bridge(x2):
Blow up the phone lines
'Cause I'm already at the red line
Somebody call me up the New York Times 
This fever's gonna make the headlines

Fever, fever, fever, fever

(Chorus x2)---Lyrics submitted by chrissy.
