stunnin like a G 
cuz there aint nobody drivin

gonna take it for a stroll 
ghostride the whip 
walkin,walkin, walk and roll

 if youre trippin on your self
youll be chasin the whip
dont do it like that shawty

if you dont do right
throw it down into coast
two step to the side

  watch it roll on
watch me campaign 
ghostridin around the world
yeah, i make my own lanes
droppin rihgt in on a one ton wave
yeah, im surfin on the hood of my chev-ro-let

      ride low, first class
nobody sittin hind my dash
dont drive too fast
you aint you aint showin out unless you got whiplash

 watch out i hear the 5-0
ghost- bustas, here come the po po
you think you can catch this
but i know that you wont
like houdini, you see me now, you dont

   uh oh uh oh
where they at , where they go
uh oh uh oh
disappearin like a ghost
kick back on the windshield
feelin so nice
this is how we do it
ghostride

    chorus...

woo woo ghostride the whip
yeah, im ridin that whip
im straight ridin
aint nobody drivin street ridin

 chop top,  shaved doors
cant stop lookin at my 24s
bet youre wishin that you could shine like this
you cant even hate on me cause you dont exist

 make room for the captian
i need clear sailin
hands off the whip unless youre doin detailin
screamin like a banshee
when i pop that clutch 
everybody hear me comin
cause i rattle that trunk

 grills comin at cha 
dont let the ghost catch ya
nippin at your heels 
drivin outta control
even though you try to 
youll never do like i do
you wanna ghostride
cause i make em say woah!!---Lyrics submitted by anda.
