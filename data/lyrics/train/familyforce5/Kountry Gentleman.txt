i come from the land 
where the mullet attacks 
business up front, 
party in the back
you gotta style in the south 
when you're steppin' out
put a gold tooth in your mouth, 
look at you now
tanktop, your ball cap  
you think your all that
but you're looking like Scott Stapp
you're just another redneck 
from back in the woods,
not a kountry gentleman 
that can bring the goods

my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
son, you best watch your mouth
my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
that's what it's all about
my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
son, you best watch your mouth
my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
that's what it's all about

IROC-Z
got any along there
throwing on some tails 
so you know i'm not a phony
am i drivin' to fast
for ya' now
backfire
the muffler goes kaPOW!!
now that i got your attention, 
just let me mention that
i'm pinching pennies,
to buy some twenties
and i got plenties
and manys, of monies
just to give to my friends
and that would certify me 
as a kountry gentleman

momma, whatcha got cooking up 
in that kitchen
cookin' fried chicken, 
you know i love that soul food, 
everything you cook is so good
for a southern man like me 
can you cook it up clean, cook it up mean
momma don't like it when we got leftovers
give me some of them collard greens
got me some grub, and i got to go 
out to the grocery store
tailgate party in a big beat, 
jumping up and down 
in the back of a truck bed
look at that kid, 
trying to act all big
trying to breakdance
or break his leg
he ain't got what i got, 
let's make it hot
in this parking lot

my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
son, you best watch your mouth
my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
that's what it's all about
my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
son, you best watch your mouth
my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
that's what it's all about

the dirty, dirty south

the dirty, dirty south

watch what you're sayin' 'round my momma
she raised me in the dirty south
i said watch what you're sayin' 'round my momma
she raised me in the dirty south
i said watch what you're sayin' 'round my momma
that's what it's all about

my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
son, you best watch your mouth
my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
that's what it's all about
my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
son, you best watch your mouth
my momma raised me in the dirty south 
a kountry gentleman
that's what it's all about---Lyrics submitted by kyle.
