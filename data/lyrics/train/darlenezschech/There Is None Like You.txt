You are holy, holy
Lord there is none like you.
You are holy, holy
Glory to you our Lord
You are holy, holy
Lord there is none like you.
You are holy, holy
Glory to you our Lord

I sing your praises forever
Deeper in love with you.
Here in your courts where I'm close to your thrown
I found where I belong.
I sing your praises forever
Deeper in love with you.
Here in your courts where I'm close to your thrown
I found where I belong.

You are holy, holy
Lord there is none like you
You are holy, holy
Glory to you, you alone.

I'll sing your praises forever
Deeper in love with you.
Here in your courts where I'm close to your thrown
I found where I belong.
I'll sing your praises forever
Deeper in love with you.
Here in your courts where I'm close to your thrown
I found where I belong.
I'll sing your praises forever
Deeper in love with you.
Here in your courts where I'm close to your thrown
I found where I belong.
I'll sing your praises forever
Deeper in love with you.
Here in your courts where I'm close to your thrown 
I found where I belong.

Here in your courts where I'm close to your thrown
I found where I belong.---Lyrics submitted by amanda.
