Walking out the door this morning
Wondering what it is that's going on with you, on with you
Thinking of a way to say
"I'm sorry" for something that I'm not sure I do, sure I do 
So come on baby, let me in and show me what this really is
'Cause something must've made you say that
What did I do to make you say, 
That to me
Something mustve made you so mad
What can I do
To make you say "come back to me"?

Hoping for a moment that I,
Turn around and you'll be coming after to me, after to me  
'Cause all that I can say is that its obvious, its obvious
You're all I see, all I see
So come on baby, let me in and show me what this really is about
'Cause I can't read you
And come on baby, let me in and show me what this really is
'Cause something must've made you say that
What did I do  to make you say, 
That to me
Something must've made you so mad
What can I do
To make you say "come back to me"?

And I'll be here in the morning if you say "stay" 
If you say "stay" to me ohh
And I'll be here in the morning if you say "stay"
If you say "stay" to me ohh
And I'll be here in the morning if you say stay
If you say "stay" to me ohh

Something must've made you say "stay" to me oh
Say "stay" to me hey ay oh no 
Say "stay" to me
Ay ay no
To me and no no no 

Something must've made you say that
What did I do 
To make you say 
That to me
Something must've made you so mad
What can I do 
To make you to make you say "come back to me"?---Lyrics submitted by Miles.
