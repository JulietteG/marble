There was a girl named Annie,she had a very pretty face
and not the way you would think so,let me see if i can try to explain it
She had a smile that could light up a room.
and if she moved it be moving you
But it wasnt like a magazine
it was just plain jane, and her name is Annie...

she never looked in the mirror
she never liked what she would see,and even if i tried to tell her
she never listend to a word i'd say..
she always wanted what she never had,but whatshe needed so badly..
someone telling her she was just fine.and thats not right and its why im singing 

Annie dont be shaken.Annie dont just stand there
looks dont make the world go round,but it comes around 
Annie dont be shakenAnnie dont just stand there
I always have to stop myself,cause youre  beautiful.. 
youre so beautiful

I didnt know if i could tell her,I didnt know if i could make her see
She didnt need to find her beauty,She didnt need to find a way to show me
they took her moments of feeling alive,And made them moments of dying inside
she needed someone to scream her name,to take her pain..and its why im screaming

Annie dont be shaken annie dont just stand there
looks dont make the world go round,but it comes around..
Annie dont be shaken.Annie dont just stand there
i always have to stop myself.cause your so beautiful
And Annie you are the one sight my eyes never tire of
Its like i cannot get enough of you
Annie you are the one song left in my symphony,like you were made for me


Annie dont be shy here,Annie dont just lie there,
looks dont make the world go round,but it comes around
Annie dont be shy here,Annie please dont cry here..
i always have to stop myself,cause your beautiful

Annie dont be shy here,Annie dont just lie there
looks dont make the world go round,but it comes around
Annie dont be shy here,Annie please dont cry here.
I always have to stop myself
Have to stop myself
Have to stop myself

Cause you are beautiful
Cause you are beautiful

Cause you are beautiful
There was a girl named Annie
She had a very pretty face..---Lyrics submitted by madison.
