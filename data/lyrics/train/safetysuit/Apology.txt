Whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh 
i wanna be with you
whoa oh
i wanna be with you
its all my fault today, im sorry for the way i was to you
its all so wrong you see and im sorry for the words i say to you
but if you ask me i will go, anything for you
but if you ask me i will go, cause baby i need you

whoa oh
i wanna be with you
whoa oh
i wanna see what you see, see what you see in me
am i on my own today, all alone with nothing left to say
can it all go back the way, it used to be when you were here with me
but if you ask me i will go, anything for you
but if you ask me i will go, cause baby i need you

whoa oh
i wanna be with you
i want you to notice me cause im already lonely and i dont know what to do
you say i cant be honest with you
you say i cant be honest, well what now

whoa oh
i wanna be with you
whoa oh
i wanna see what you see,see what you see in me
whoa oh 
i want you to notice me cause im already lonely and i dont know what to do
i dont know what to do baby, i dont know what to do
i dont know what to do baby, i dont know what to do---Lyrics submitted by brandi.
