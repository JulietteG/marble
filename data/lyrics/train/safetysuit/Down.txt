i sat by the phone today 
waiting for you to call so i could
pick it up and say hello to you and you 
would say hello to me.
just like my dreams.

is there a reason that tour gone?
i did'nt mean to be so wrong and
i tried so hard to be the best i could be
but it seems 
i will always end up alone.

is there something inside of me 
that i don't see? 
is there something wrong here with the way i love?

down,
you can't hold me down,
so when no one is around 
i won't be standing here 
just waiting for you to come back home to me.

Down,
you can't hold me down, 
cause I finally understand 
that what you did was not so bad,
in fact it's better for me.

did i not give you enough room?
was i over taking you?
did my love for you just blind me from
what i was doing wrong?
i did'nt mean to harm.

one more
was i not good enough for you? 
is that the reason why we're through?
was i half the man you thought 
I would be, but now i see.
is that why you leave me?
is that why you leave me?

is there something inside me
that i don't see?
is there something wrong here 
with the way i love?

Down,
you can't hold me down,
so when no one is around
I won't be standing here just
waiting for you to come back home again.

Down,
You can't hold me down,
cause I finally understand that what you did is not so bad
in fact it's better for me.

we all know i try 
to bring back all my dreams.
cause i held on to yours 
for so long that i should have held my own.

Down,
You can't hold me down,
so when no one is around
I won't be standing here 
waiting for you to come back home
to me.

Down,
You can't hold me down,
cause I finally understand
 that what you did is not so bad.
in fact it's better for me.

Down! Down! 
You can't hold me down!
