i think about life 
and oh how it changes so fast
and oh how it's so hard to last
here
waiting for something to give

i think about time
a luxury so hard to find
and i just cant figure out why 
i 
waisted it all here without you

but ill be, fine
oh dont you worry 
cause ill be, fine
yes im in a hurry to be 
gone away, awhile
tell me all, the things, that i
i'll be missing here in this old life 
man cause i just dont know

i think about you
and all of the times that we shared
and oh what a wonderful pair
we
made it so far here we go again

i think about love
and oh what a beautiful song
and oh how it needs to be sung
here
sing it so lound all the world can hear

i think i'll be
gone away, awhile
tell me all, the things that i
i'll be missing here in this old life
man cause i just dont know

i think i'll be 
gone away, awhile
tell me all, the things that i
i'll be missing here in this old life
man cause i just dont know
no, no
i just dont know

i just dont know

but i'll be fine
oh dont you worry 
cause i'll be fine
see i'm in no hurry
no i'll be fine
OH, DONT YOU WORRY
CAUSE I'LL BE FINE
SEE I'M IN A HURRY TO BE
GONE AWAY, AWHILE
TELL ME ALL, THE THINGS, THAT I
I'LL BE MISSING HERE IN THIS OLD LIFE
MAN CAUSE I JUST DONT KNOW
NO, NO

I THINK I'LL BE 
GONE AWAY, AWHILE
TELL ME ALL THE THINGS THAT I
I'LL BE MISSING HERE IN THIS OLD LIFE
MAN CAUSE I JUST DONT KNOW
NO, NO
I JUST DONT KNOW

(i'll be
gone away awhile
tell me all the things that i
i'll be missing here in this old life
man cause i just dont know)---Lyrics submitted by kayla.
