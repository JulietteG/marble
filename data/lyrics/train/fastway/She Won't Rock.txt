She wont rock, She wont rock, She wont rock. Doctor when it gonna stop?
She wont rock, She wont rock, She wont rock. Doctor how long has she got?

Tell me doctor if you think theres something wrong, 
She wont move a muscle to any kind of song.
Ive been playing her my favorite kinda tunes, 
But nothing seems to get her, not even rhythm and blues.
Give her something, give her medicine or pills, 
Something thatll get her, back onto her heals.
She needs some treatment, I think she needs it fast, 
So just give her a jab of rock and roll thats gonna last...coz

She wont rock, She wont rock, She wont rock. Doctor when it gonna stop?
She wont rock, She wont rock, She wont rock. Doctor how long has she got? [2x]

Tell me doctor if you think its gonna last,
Is her condition terminal or is it gonna pass
We were so happy when she was into sound, 
Aint there some operation, to help to bring her round?
Conditions serious, Im not sure she can hear, 
Ten milligrams of heavy rock pumping in her ear
Shouldnt end like this, weve got to try at least, 
To give her back some rock or else shell never rest in peace ...coz

She wont rock, She wont rock, She wont rock. Doctor when it gonna stop?
She wont rock, She wont rock, She wont rock. Doctor how long has she got? [2x]

She wont rock, She wont rock, She wont rock. Doctor when it gonna stop?
She wont rock, She wont rock, She wont rock. Doctor how long has she got? [4x] [Fade out]---Lyrics submitted by Ed Gage.
