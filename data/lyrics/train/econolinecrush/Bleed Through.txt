Is this how it ends
With a broken heart and bottle in my hands
In this dirty room I crawl into
Runnin' away from the ghost of you

You tore it all apart
Lost our way, have we gone too far?
There could never be enough for you
Nothin' hurts like cold, hard truth

I never felt so alone
O woah woah woah
This city feels so damn cold

Tell me was I wrong, was I right
Fought hard with all my might
My soul kicked black and blue
All my pain comes bleedin' through

Tell me was I wrong, was I right
Fought hard with all my might
My soul kicked black and blue
All my pain comes back to you

Mountain of demands
Angry words and blood on my hands
I fell into a burnin' rage
Felt the fire burn through me

When you took my hand
Were you playin' a part
Did you ever understand?
Complicated, so like me
Lives to feel love's for real

I never felt so alone
O woah woah woah
This city feels so damn cold

Tell me was I wrong, was I right
Fought hard with all my might
My soul kicked black and blue
All my pain comes bleedin' through

Tell me was I wrong, was I right
Fought hard with all my might
My soul kicked black and blue
All my pain comes back to you

O woah woah woah
O woah woah woah
O woah woah woah---Lyrics submitted by Myra.
