Crash......
 Would you like me to forget myself
 and loose myself 
in you

Push......
 Just one push will do
 Then I'm overboard
 Drowning in you

I hear a          whisper slowly and
 Soon our lips will be near
 In between the day and night
 I step into the blue twilight 
Catch me, darling catch me!!!!

Hold me back
 I think I'm falling
 Over you,
 what did you do?

Help me now
 I'm losing me....into you
 What did you do?
 What did you do?

Yo hmmmm
no se como abrazarme a tus brazos
y no sufrir,
voy         por la vida hmmmm
pidiendote un amor
que suicidar
asi.... 
susurrndome
tu te vienes a mi
mas y mas
sin mas te quiero
quiereme
y mucho mas

mas y mas
Dentro de mi 
entrars
sin mas ni mas
mas y mas
y mas ni mas
mas ni mas
mas ni mas

Walk, I walk a line that leads to you 
Waiting....anticipating
 desire has no safety 
To lead you on the road 
Going crazy

I hear a whisper slowly &
 Soon our lips will be near

Hold me back
 I think I'm falling
 Over you, what did you do?

Help me now
 I'm losing me into you
 What did you do?
 What did you do?

I hear you whisper darling.....darling

In between the day and night
 I step into the blue twilight
 Catch me, darling catch me

Hold me back
 I think I'm falling
 Over you, what did you do?

Help me now
 I'm losing me.... Into you

What did you do?
 What did you do?
 What did you do? I think I'm falling
 What did you do?
 What did you do? I think I'm falling

Help me now
 I'm losing me.... Into you
 What did you do?
 What did you do?---Lyrics submitted by MEYLYN GUERRERO.
