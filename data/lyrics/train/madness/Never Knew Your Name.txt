It was very late in the discotheque
I was feeling blue as I sometimes do
I turned around it was time to go
A face in the crowd a face I didn't know
We got to talking for a little while
You said it's not the sort of thing you usually do
Talking to strangers so late in the night
These days you never know

Well I thought you were nice I even told you so
But you smiled so shyly and said to me
I bet you say that to all the girls you meet
But it isn't so
Yes, the club was closing so we had to leave
We walked out together just a little ill at ease
I would have liked to have walked you home
But you said you'd catch the bus so I ended up alone

I never knew your name nor your telephone number
Will I ever see you again? I wonder?

It wasn't any longer than an hour or two
That lonely street I said goodbye to you
You glanced back at me as I turned the corner
Was the last I saw of you

Oh I wanted to call, call out your name
But stupid pride and idiot shame
Hesitated, scared of playing the fool
So you walked away, from Mr Cool

I never knew your name nor your telephone number
Will I ever see you again? I wonder?
No, I never knew your name nor your telephone number
Will I see you again? Oh girl I wonder?
It was very late in the discotheque
I was feeling blue as I sometimes do
I thought you were nice I told you so
But I ended up alone

No, I never knew your name nor your telephone number
Will I ever see you again? Girl, I wonder?

It's so very late in the discotheque and I'm feeling blue
As I always do
I turn around 'cause its time to go---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
