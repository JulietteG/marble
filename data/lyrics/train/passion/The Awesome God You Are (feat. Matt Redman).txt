Let your Majesty
Speak peace to me
And chase my fears away
To my heart I preach
Your sovereignty
And the power of your Name
I'll stand in awe
Of You alone

God, let hope arise
And faith become
The fortress of my heart
I will lift my eyes
And see You as
The awesome God You are
Believe You as
The awesome God You are
You are
Jesus, the awesome God You are

You're the glory of
Our brightest days
The comfort of
Our nights
When the darkest shades
Are all we see
You're the everlasting light
I'll stand in awe
Of You alone

God, let hope arise
And faith become
The fortress of my heart
I will lift my eyes
And see You as
The awesome God You are
Believe You as
The awesome God You are

And see You on your throne
So high above
See you watching
Over me in love
I will worship You
And You alone
The awesome God You are
The awesome God You are

God, let hope arise
We pray
God, let hope arise
God, let hope arise
And faith become
The fortress of my heart
I will lift my eyes
And see You as
The awesome God You are
Believe You as
The awesome God You are
King Jesus as
The awesome God You are
You are

Believe you as
The awesome God You are
Believe you as
The awesome God You are
Believe you as
The awesome God You are
King Jesus as
The awesome God You are
You are---
