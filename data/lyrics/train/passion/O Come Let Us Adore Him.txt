O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the lord

Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultations,
O Sing, all ye bright hosts of heavn above;
Glory to god all
Glory in the highest:
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the lord

See how the shepherds,
Summoned to his cradle,
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;
We too will thither
Bend our joyful footsteps;
(chorus)

Yea, lord, we greet thee,
Born this happy morning,
Jesus, to thee be glory given;
Word of the father,
Now in flesh appearing:
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the lord

O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the lord---Lyrics submitted by leanne.
