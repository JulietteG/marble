Let it be Jesus
The first name that I call
Let it be Jesus
My song inside the storm
Ill never need another

For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ
And God I breathe Your name
Above everything
Let it be
Let it be Jesus

Let it be Jesus
From the rising of the sun
Let it be Jesus
When all is said and done

Ill never need another
Jesus, theres no other
For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ
And God I breathe Your name
Above everything
Let it be
Let it be Jesus

Should I ever be abandoned
Should I ever be acclaimed
Should I ever be surrounded
By the fire and the flame
Theres a name I will remember
Theres a name I will proclaim
Let it be
Let it be Jesus---
