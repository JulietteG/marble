God our Savior, God our matchless King
God Your glory never faltering
Your mercy forever
Your mercy for all

Oh, Lord my God when in awesome wonder
Sing my soul, Your song again
Oh, Lord my God when I'm lost in wonder
Sing my soul, How great Thou art
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

God our Promise, God our coming King
God our Maker, God of every thing
Your justice, forever
Your justice for all

Who can comprehend what You've done for us
Oh, who can comprehend Your unfailing love
Your glory, forever, our Savior, our God---
