I'm forgiven because you were forsaken
I'm accepted, You were condemned
I'm alive and well your Spirit is within me
Because you died and rose again
(repeat section 1)

Amazing love how can it be 
That you my king would die for me?
Amazing love, I know its true
Its my joy to honor you
(repeat section 2)

In all i do i honor you
You are my king
You are my king
Jesus you are my king
Jesus you are my king
(repeat section 2)
