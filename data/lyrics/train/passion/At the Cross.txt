(feat. Chris Tomlin)

Theres a place where mercy reigns
And never dies
Theres a place where streams of grace
Flow deep and wide
Where all the love
Ive ever found
Comes like a flood
Comes flowing down

At the cross, at the cross
I surrender my life
Im in awe of You
Im in awe of You
Where Your love ran red
And my sin washed white
I owe all to You
I owe all to You, Jesus

Theres a place where sin and shame
Are powerless
Where my heart has peace with God
And forgiveness
Where all the love
Ive ever found
Comes like a flood
Comes flowing down

Here
My hope is found
Here
On Holy ground
Here I bow down
Here I bow down
Here
Arms open wide
Here
You saved my life
Here I bow down
Here I bow down---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
