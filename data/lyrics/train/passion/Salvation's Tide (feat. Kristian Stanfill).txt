There is no winning to your power
There is no stopping your plan
You give us faith to move the mountains
And hope to dream again

We see the fires of revival
The darkness giving way to light
The glory of Your grace advancing
Let it burn up the night
Let it burn up the night

Let the walls come down in Jesus' name
Let the lost be found in Jesus' name
Let the Church arise to shine Your light to the world
Shine Your light

Your house, forever, undivided
All Your sons and daughters won
At the cross we are united
Our hope is in the blood
Our hope is in Your blood

Let the walls come down in Jesus' name
Let the lost be found in Jesus' name
Let the Church arise to shine Your light to the world
Shine Your light
Open eyes to see in Jesus' name
Let the city sing in Jesus' name
Let the Church arise to shine Your light to the world
Shine Your light

Salvation's tide is rising
As all Your people seek Your face
Your life a river flowing
To wash our sin and shame away

Let the walls come down in Jesus' name
Let the lost be found in Jesus' name
Let the Church arise to shine Your light to the world
Shine Your light
Open eyes to see in Jesus' name
Let the city sing in Jesus' name
Let the Church arise to shine Your light to the world
Shine Your light

Salvation's tide is rising
As all Your people seek Your face
Your life a river flowing
To wash our sin and shame away---
