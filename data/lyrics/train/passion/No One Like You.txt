Verse 1
You are more beautiful than anyone ever
Everyday You're the same
You never change, no never

And how could I ever deny the love of my Savior
You are to me everything
All I need, forever

Prechorus
How could You be so good?

Chorus
There is no one like You
There has never ever been anyone like You
There is no one like You
There has never ever been anyone like You

Verse 2
Everyone You are there
Earth or air, surrounding
I'm not alone, the heavens sing along
My God You're so outstanding

Bridge
How could You be so good to me?
How could You be so good to me?
We're not alone, so sing along
We're not alone, so sing along
So sing along, sing along, sing along (Here we go)

Outro
There is no one like You
There has never been anyone like You
There is no one like You
There has never been anyone like You
There is no one like our God---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
