My eyes have seen the Risen One
Shining like the sun
He came to rescue me
The curse of sin and shame are done
Death was over come
The day He came for me

Now I have a song to sing
I was lost, then Jesus You found me
Now I live for ever free
I was lost, then Jesus You found me

The Cross, standing in my place
Every debt is paid
I stand in victory
The curse of sin and shame are done
Death was overcome
The day He came for me

You are my God and I will praise You, praise You
For all You've done, yes I will praise You
You are my God and I will exalt You, exalt You
For all You've, yes, I will exalt You---
