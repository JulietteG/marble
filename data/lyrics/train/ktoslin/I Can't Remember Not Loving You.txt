I'm having trouble remembering things
If I don't make a list it'll all get lost
Sometimes I wonder where I parked my car
I can't read nothin' with my glasses off. 

(Refrain)
Let me tell you what I can't forget
How I fell for you the night we met
Oooh baby, the things you do
I can't remember not lovin' you
I can't remember not lovin' you

Sometimes I find myself in the middle of the room
Wonderin' what it is I'm lookin' for
So I forget some things It's no big deal
I don't sweat the small stuff, not any more

Refrain

(Bridge)
And ooooh if I need a little help to remember
I just tie a string around my finger

Refrain

I can't remember not lovin you
Chorus, etc.  Fade---Lyrics submitted by Markus Sharkus.
