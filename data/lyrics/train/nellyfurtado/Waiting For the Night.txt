Baby I know youre outside
In here its warm and dry
Got feelings that Ive got to try expressing
Like a language that I share with you
Lets talk in the special way we do
Dont want to be anywhere else but here with you
Feels so good

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I cant help, help myself at all
I cant hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I cant help, help myself from falling
So Im waiting for the night

Baby I know its late
Weve got decisions to make
Think of what we could create together
And with you I am never afraid
To play with the highest stakes
Nobody could break my rapture

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I cant help, help myself at all
I cant hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I cant help, help myself from falling
So Im waiting for the night

I cant control it in the night, night, night
Its when Ive got you on my mind, mind, mind
Cuz youre the twinkle in my eye, eye, eye
Ive got to get you in my life, life, life
Cant think of nothing worse than being lonely
I think youre the right choice for one and only
Were running out of time so baby hold me
Days go by

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I cant help, help myself at all
I cant hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I cant help, help myself from falling
So Im waiting for the night

Im waiting, Im waiting, Im waiting
Im waiting, Im waiting, Im waiting
Waiting for the night
Yeah, I really want to see you yeah 
I really want to see you tonight
Dont keep me waiting waiting, 
dont keep me waiting for the night---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
