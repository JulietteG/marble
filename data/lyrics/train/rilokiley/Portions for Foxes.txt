There's blood in my mouth 'cause I've been biting my tongue all week 
I keep on talkin' trash but I never say anything 
And the talkin' leads to touchin' 
and the touchin' leads to sex 
and then there is no mystery left 

And It's bad news 
Baby I'm bad news 
I'm just bad news, bad news, bad news 

I know I'm alone if I'm with or without you 
but just bein' around you offers me another form of relief 
When the loneliness leads to bad dreams 
and the bad dreams lead me to callin' you 
and I call you and say "C'MERE!" 

And it's bad news 
Baby I'm bad news 
I'm just bad news, bad news, bad news 

And it's bad news 
Baby it's bad news 
It's just bad news, bad news, bad news 

'Cause you're just damage control 
for a walking corpse like me - like you 

'Cause we'll all be 
Portions for foxes 
Yeah we'll all be 
Portions for foxes 

There's a pretty young thing in front of you 
and she's real pretty and she's real into you 
and then she's sleepin' inside of you 
and the talkin' leads to touchin' 
then touchin' leads to sex 
and then there is no mystery left 

And it's bad news 
I don't blame you 
I do the same thing 
I get lonely too 

And you're bad news 
My friends tell me to leave you 
That you're bad news, bad news, bad news 

That you're bad news 
Baby you're bad news
and you're bad news 
Baby you're bad news 
and you're bad news 
I don't care I like you 
and you're bad news 
I don't care I like you 
I like you---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
