The absence of god will bring you comfort baby
And planning's for the poor, so let's pretend that we're rich
And I'm not my body, or how I choose to destroy it

Folk singers sing songs for the working baby
We're just recreation for all those doctors and lawyers
There's no relief for the bleeding heart
Cause they'll be losing bodies tonight

Rob says you love, love, love, then you die
I've watched him while sleeping
And seen him crying with closed eyes

And you're not happy but you're funny
And I'm tripping over my joy
I just keep getting up again

We could be daytime drunks if we wanted
We'd never get anything done that way baby
And we'd still be ruled by our dueling perspectives
And I'm not my perspective or the lies I'll tell you every time

Morgan says maybe love won't let you down
All of your failures are training grounds
And just as your back's turned
You'll be surprised, she says, as your solitude subsides

And I'll teach you how to swim
If you'll turn the bad in me into good again

And I say there's trouble when everything is fine
The need to destroy things creeps up on me every time
And just as love's silhouette appears 
I close my eyes and disappear tonight

And something's got to change
Cause our love's the slowest moving train---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
