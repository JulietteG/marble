Let's be honest, we're all criminals here so take the halo down
Autograph hunters making legends out of scumbags from a better town
21 at midnight, it's a curse of a man who'd kill to put it off
Wrestling grizzly bears just to draw a crowd
a crowd that would have jumped at dogs

When you're 21 at midnight you act like a man
look him in the eyes and say what you just said to me then
21 at midnight
your tombstone in hand
you fight so hard to give away for free what you'll just want again

a virtual who's-who of the who-cares, the self appointed king and queen
Better off jester rather tame the troops than fertilize the village green
hey I knew you back in 1999, I know you don't forget
Obligations plague you still why can't you shed em yet?

When you're 21 at midnight you act like a man
look him in the eyes and say what you just said to me then
21 at midnight
your tombstone in hand
you fight so hard to give away for free what you'll just want again
you'll just want again

And on this night in a border town
you'll wave goodbye to your father's son
And on this night in a drunken brawl
you'll say hello to your poor child's father
who's 21 at midnight

He thinks he's a man
look him in the eyes and say what you just said to me then
21 at midnight
your tombstone in hand
you fight so hard to give away for free what you will just want again
what you will just want again---
