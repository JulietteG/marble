Nobody knows what's gonna happen now
Sold all nine daughters and traded all the cows
Salute the 21st century dreamers as we wake up in a jail cell
Let the people think you're hiding something better than what you got
It sure beats hiding nothing
Paranoid? you can't blame me it's just JFK's LSD
We signed a waiver now we're testing, testing, 123
Can't get enough
Got quite a hunch you're scratching someone's crack
Don't let them fool, you lobotomies are back!
Salute the 21st century genius
Throw grenades instead of baby showers---
