And now the road leading to North
The four of us in a big old car
The way youre driving is making me nervous
The load is mine and theres nowhere out

Pull on the breaks and we can stop
The only way that is a lot way down
Its a lost road within of section
High above the cold,cold Northern Sea

Oh,we are,we are driving
We are driving too fast
Oh,we are,we are driving
And we will crash

Starting fire
Fire when we crash
Starting fire
Is the fire when we crash

I tell you its too cold for a man to live
He sees us alive and drives again
But its okay ,cause were in this together
Yeah,its okay cause were in this together
So here were standing in the sunset direction
And everybody is trying hard to move on
How did we end up so far from each other?

Oh,we are,we are driving
We are driving too fast
Oh,we are,we are driving
And we will crash

Starting fire
Fire when we crash
Starting fire
The fire when we crash

Oh, we are, we are driving
We are driving too fast
Oh, we are, we are driving
And we will crash

Starting fire
Fire when we crash
Starting fire
The fire when we crash---
