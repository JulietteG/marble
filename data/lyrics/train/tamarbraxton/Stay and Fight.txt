We could walk away from this mess we made
We could live and learn, set fire to this bridge and watch it burn
We can act like it was not even really love in the first place

We could throw out the pictures
And throw our dreams aways
We could forget the words we were too afraid to say
And we can live with the mistake, tearing us apart everyday
We could let all the good just fade away

[Chorus]
But I wanna stay and fight for you
Fight till my heart is black and blue
Fight till there's nothing left not a single shred of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us
Fight like hell before I give up
Till I'm the only one, the only one in love
I fight for you

We could turn off our feelings
And go about our days, put on the happy face
Tell everyone that we okay
And we could just say you and me were probably never meant to be
Or we could be nothing than a memory

[Chorus]
But I wanna stay and fight for you
Fight till my heart is black and blue
Fight till there's nothing left not a single shred of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us
Fight like hell before I give up
Till I'm the only one, the only one in love
I fight for you

Cause we done walked through the fire baby
We still survived baby
You know where I stand, then, I'll be a waiting
Cause it'll never be my choice baby
To give up on us really
When it's so rare to find in the first place
When you're the realest thing I've ever knew

[Chorus]
I wanna stay and fight for you
Fight till my heart is black and blue
Fight till there's nothing left not a single shred of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us
Fight like hell before I give up
Till I'm the only one, the only one in love
I fight for you---Lyrics submitted by Lola Thompson.
