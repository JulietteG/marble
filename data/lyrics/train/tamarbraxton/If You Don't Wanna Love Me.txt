[Verse 1:]
I stopped by to see you
just the other day
And I wanna say
That I finally realized
the words I love you don't mean a thing

It's so hard for me to see
Because you meant everything to me
But I guess I gotta move on
Even though it hurts I gotta be strong

[Hook:]
If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
Cause I don't want you
To do anything, that you don't want to do

And if you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do no

[Verse 2:]
Who would've known that on
The nights that you were hanging late
All alone I'd lay awake in our bed
Someone else was putting food on your plate

I refuse to believe
that you never ever loved me
I've gotta move on,
our love is gone
And this house is not a home

[Hook:]
If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
Cause I don't want you
To do anything, that you don't want to do

And if you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do no

[Bridge:]
You can be lonely
I don't really care
But didn't have to make me think
That you would be right here
You said that you would be there
So if you don't

[Hook:]
If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
Cause I don't want you
To do anything, that you don't wanna do

And if you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do
