Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight,

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away, 

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore,
Faithful friends who are dear to us
They gather near to us once more, 

Through the years we all will be together 
and if the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow, 
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
