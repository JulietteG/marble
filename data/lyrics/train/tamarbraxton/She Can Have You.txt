Ain't nothing like being alone at Christmas
Everybody's got a man but me
Again this year
Well it'll be nice for once in my life
To get this love back this time of year right
But I'm still alone

I'll be alone and you that I know you won't find a better woman
And to tell the truth
She can have you
(She can have you, She can have you)
'Cause I've put up with enough
(She can have you)

I saw you at the mall with your new girlfriend
With a bag of gifts that should be mine
'Cause she ain't put in the time,
Caught you in a bunch of lies
Tried and I tried and I sacrificed
Now here you are
Acting like you so low
We broke up two weeks ago
'Cause you wanna find yourself
But you're here with her
So now I'm all alone

I'll be alone but you won't find a better woman
And to tell the truth
She can have you
(She can have you, She can have you)
(I promise you)
'Cause I've put up with enough
(She can have you)

Now we've been back and forth for a whole year now
And you'd think that by Christmas we can work it out
'Cause who wants to be alone?
And who wants to play along
With someone who do you wrong
'Cause it ain't worth it

I'll be alone but you won't find a better woman
She can have you
(She can have you, She can have you)
'Cause I've put up with enough
(I done had enough)
She can have you

I don't care if it's Christmas
Halloween, New Year's Eve
Easter, Palm Sunday,
President's Day, any old holiday
I don't care if I'm here alone

She can have you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
