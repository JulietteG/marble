Sitting in the dark, off in my room, thinking of you
I'm at the brink of me, breaking down
Cause all these thoughts of me and you apart
Won't leave my head right now

Baby, baby, call me crazy
Cause I know without you I won't be no good
When the latch on my heart comes unhooked

You should know if I don't have you
(Rocks me to the core, I can't love no more)
If I don't have you
(Know I'm done for sure, nobody worth fighting for)
I'm tired of these walls that's on my life
I'll lose my mind if I don't have you
If I don't have you

Looking at the phone, but you don't even call
I put it in the draw, cause I wanna be right next to you
If you wanna talk, baby come on through
Before it's all done, tell me I'm your only one

So wait till they it start things over
Can't seem to get it together
We try, and we try, but we won't look wrong dead in their eyes
Try and make it right, cause I don't wanna fight
Can't see myself without you in my mind
Please don't say you're done with me
Cause you're my baby, baby

Cause you know if I don't have you
(Rocks me to the core, I can't love no more)
If I don't have you
(Know I'm done for sure, nobody worth fighting for)
I'm tired of these walls that's on my life
I'll lose my mind if I don't
If I don't have you
(Rocks me to the core, I can't love no more)
If I don't have you, I know I'm done for sure
Nobody worth fighting for, I'm tired of these walls
That's on my life, I'll lose my mind if I don't have you
If I don't have (you)
Baby, baby---
