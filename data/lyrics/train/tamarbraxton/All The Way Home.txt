Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back, oh
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back

Don't even know why we fighting for
Damn I need a minute, so baby keep your distance
Heard it out, so Imma just go
Don't bother waiting up, I just need some time alone
Damn where the hell are my keys
I just wanna leave, get in my car, and Imma just drive, all night
Turn off my phone, radio on, and drive
So why I'm just

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I cant even deny
I've been Thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
Thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been Thinking about you all the way home

Hey baby, I'm back and I'm calmed down
I've done with all cursing
I came to give you a little something
You got me screaming for a different reason now
While we're breaking stuff, tearing it up
Neighbors hear you loud, I need down, all night

Where the hell are my car, I don't wanna go
But its getting late, so imma just drive all night
Moving real slow, radio low, just drive
So why I'm just

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I cant even deny
I've been Thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been Thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been Thinking about you all the way home
And who I thank I'm fooling anyway
I'm driving around the block to come right back to you
When all along, I knew I should have stayed right where I wasn't
Instead of drive and think of you

So why I'm just

Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I cant even deny
I've been Thinking about you all the way home

Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been Thinking about you all the way home
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
Imma turn back
I've been Thinking about you all the way home

Oh oh
(Oh oh)
Oh oh
(Oooooooo)
Imma turn right back babe ,imma come right back to you
Oooooooo
Imma turn right back babe, imma come right back to you ---
