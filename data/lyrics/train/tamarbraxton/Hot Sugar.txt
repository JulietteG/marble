Ladies, just so you know
Don't leave the house with a little kiss when you man man's got a big ego
Fronting on the cat, don't play like, I, I, I, I gots to go
Cut it out, give your man what he dreams about
T-shirt and some heels on while he chase you all around the house
Get em real bad, drop it low and bring it back
Oh he ain't gotta ask cause I do it for my man
Wind it up slow, put him on the front row
Tell him welcome to the show, yeah I do that for my man

(He want that hot sugar, sugar)
He wanna piece of something sweet all night
He want that good to the last drop like mine
He want that sugar, He want that sugar
He want that sugar, sugar
(He want that hot sugar, sugar)
I'll be his sweet little mama all the time
And we can do it now or later that's fine
He want that sugar, He want that sugar
He want that sugar, sugar
Pop it, Pop it, Pop it
Pop it, Pop it, Pop it

He said I'm sexy right, I told him close his eyes
I lit a candle in the room that was the only light
I turned the speakers up, I told him he could look
She got that in the oven, that sugar taste so good
Ain't never harmed with a lil loving, long as I make it sweet
Got the good that always bring my baby to his knees
Never let him leave out hungry, what, he got that fever
Never let him leave out hungry, what, you gots to please

(He want that hot sugar, sugar)
He wanna piece of something sweet all night
He want that good to the last drop like mine
He want that sugar, He want that sugar
He want that sugar, sugar
(He want that hot sugar, sugar)
I'll be his sweet little mama all the time
And we can do it now or later that's fine
He want that sugar, He want that sugar
He want that sugar, sugar
Pop it, Pop it, Pop it
Pop it, Pop it, Pop it

Watch me heat it up, make it stop, be a sugar fiend
Watch me heat it up, sugar rush, can you make it stick
Watch me heat it up, make it stop, be a sugar fiend
Watch me heat it up, sugar rush, can you make it stick

(He want that hot sugar, sugar)
He wanna piece of something sweet all night
He want that good to the last drop like mine
He want that sugar, He want that sugar
He want that sugar, sugar
(He want that hot sugar, sugar)
I'll be his sweet little mama all the time
And we can do it now or later that's fine
He want that sugar, He want that sugar
He want that sugar, sugar
Pop it, Pop it, Pop it
Pop it, Pop it, Pop it
Pop it, Pop it, Pop it
Pop it, Pop it, Pop it ---
