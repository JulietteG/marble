Do you remember when life was simple and plain to see?
Easier to pretend than to close the door and turn the key.

Livin' and hopein' and laughin' and cryin' 
Touchin' and feelin' and dreamin' and dyin'
A life without love is a life that's still lyin' to the heart

Walk away leave me as you found me,
to the world around me, turn your back and walk away

Do you remember when we were young and unashamed?
And yet even then we were learning to play the game.

Livin' and Hopein' and laughin' and cryin'
touchin' and feelin' and dreamin' and dyin'
A life without love is a life that's still lyin' to the heart

Walk away leave me as you found,
to the world around me just turn your back and walk away, walk away
leave me as you found me to the world around me just turn your back and walk away......---Lyrics submitted by Nora Chisamore.
