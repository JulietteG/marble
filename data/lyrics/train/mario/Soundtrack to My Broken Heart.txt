What are we fighting for?
Why do we even bother?
We don't see eye to eye no more
This house is tearing apart

Chorus
I know love ain't fair
I know it ain't perfect
But i can't be here
'Cuz your love ain't worth it

A part of me scared
A part of me searchin'
And this is how it sounds hwn my heart cries (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
And you won't even come to rescue me (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
I'm cryin' for you babe
This is the soundtrack of my broken heart

What are we screamin' for?
Why does it matter?
When you walkin' out that door
And my heart is breakin' in half

Chorus
I know love ain't fair
I know it ain't perfect
But i can't be here
'Cuz your love ain't worth it

A part of me scared
A part of me searchin'
And this is how it sounds hwn my heart cries (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
And you won't even come to rescue me (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
I'm cryin' for you babe
This is the soundtrack of my broken heart

You see me drivin'
But you won't save my life
I'm dying baby (dying baby)
My bestest neighbour in love
To keep you happy

So listen to the sound of my broken heart (to get over you)
And you won't even come to my rescue (come to my rescue)
This is the soundtrack to my broken heart.---Lyrics submitted by Mel.
