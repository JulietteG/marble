[Intro:]
You left me for somebody else
You left me for somebody else
You left me for somebody else
You left me for somebody else

[Verse:]
I never saw the day coming
That you would ever wanna leave me
Baby you told me no matter where you are
Youd always be with me
Always be for me, yea baby

[Pre-Chorus:)
Now Im all alone
Said she wanna be gone yea
I dont really like it
But I gotta take it
Damn damn damn now
When youre coming back?
So youre never coming back, yea
I I I I dont believe that
But right now I gotta accept the fact yea

[Chorus:]
You left me for somebody else now
I wish never allowed ya
You left me, baby you left me
Girl, I guess Ill take it off your love
You left me for somebody else now
Girl I wish I never met you
You left me, baby you left me
Cause I wouldnt be alone

[Verse:]
Girl, your beauty
Made me feel like you were my everything
Made me think you was fresher, no
Yea, I got issues, like youre any better
Said you will always be there but I just lost my girl

[Pre-Chorus:]
Now Im all alone
Said she wanna be gone yea
I dont really like it
But I gotta take it
Damn damn damn now
When youre coming back?
So youre never coming back, yea
I I I I dont believe that
But right now I gotta accept the fact yea

[Chorus:]
You left me for somebody else now
I wish never allowed ya
You left me, baby you left me
Girl, I guess Ill take it off your love
You left me for somebody else now
Girl I wish I never met you
You left me, baby you left me
Cause I wouldnt be alone

[Verse:]
How would you have learned if I didnt leave?
I guess I was way too naive
I should have been checked you
But I let you get mad, disrespectful
You couldnt be serious, boy is you
Lookin at my new man, wish it was you
But you dead now
The sign of the cross on your chest and yo head now
Guilty is what you feel now
Left Queens for Brooklyn, Im on a belt now
Stupid is what you felt now
When you see me on TV have a meltdown
Bombs away
Tryna sneak tip heavily when sloms away
But we going for that end, got time a day
How Imma tell Channelle get that Lagerfeld

[Pre-Chorus:]
Now Im all alone
Said she wanna be gone yea
I dont really like it
But I gotta take it
Damn damn damn now
When youre coming back?
So youre never coming back, yea
I I I I dont believe that
But right now I gotta accept the fact yea

[Chorus:]
You left me for somebody else now
I wish never allowed ya
You left me, baby you left me
Girl, I guess Ill take it off your love
You left me for somebody else now
Girl I wish I never met you
You left me, baby you left me
Cause I wouldnt be alone---
