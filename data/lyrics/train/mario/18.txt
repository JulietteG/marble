INTRO:
Cassidy: Hey yo, ya'll ready man?
Mario: Yeah, I'm ready
(Mario)
Cassidy: Cassidy, 3rd Street, Full Surface
All I want to do, is do me, ya feel me?
Aw!

CHORUS:
Next Time, ya'll N****s try to compare me,
remember, I just turned 18,
That means I got seven years to catch up,
So what's up?
(So what's up?)
Next time ya'll underestimate me 
(Ya'll don't want to do that)
Recognize I just turned 18 (Still young),
that means I got seven years to catch up,
so what's up?

VERSE 1:
I brush the dirt off my shoulder,
Push through the city in an all pearl rover
One day I wanna be just like my N**** Hova
But they don't wanna let me
Hate that they hate me
Saying what I CAN'T be
But I'ma stay up on their bumper
Keepin the radios jumpin all summer
Having the girls screamin just to take a picture
I'm setting up my features
My bank account's reachin
and everybody's peakin

CHORUS X 1

VERSE 2:
This is a funny situation
these cats I grew up
Having crazy admiration for
Got the feelin that I'm tryin to replace 'em
That ain't the case
I'm in a whole 'nother place
trying build my estate
Gotta keep my Nikes nice and clean
keep the women up to 25 chasin me
got Mr. Davis pushin buttons in the captain's seat
That means more dough,
before I'm too old
They said it before.

CHORUS X 1

CASSIDY'S RAP:
Yeah, yo, Mario,
Don't let him get you,
he's the homie that's only go harder
Don't let 'em underestimate you
like you ain't Tony Otaro
Plus them dudes that be hating as old as your father
You got plenty time,
you gonna get plenty shine
I don't pay 'em any mind,
They been tryin to criticize,
But you can't live your life
through another N*****s eyes,
I'm the best and you young boys know,
So, I'ma fall back and let my young boy blow

CHORUS X 2
MARIO: Yeah
I told ya'll don't underestimate a young boy
Yeah
Ya heard me?
CASSIDY: My man Mario comin next
MARIO: (Sung) Next time, ya'll wanna compare me to somebody else. (Spoken) Hey man
let's get out of here, man
CASSIDY: Whoa. Ya'll already know what to expect.
We're not done!
One.---
