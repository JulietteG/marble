[Intro]
They said I was a narcissist haha. The narcissistest. Trick! Yeah! Strange Music baby!

[Hook]
(He's a mental giant)
That's what they say
(He's a mental giant)
To those who nay-say
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
Hey! I'm lookin' down on you niggas
Even though I'm 5'8 & 195 pound on you niggas
So tall I can't even hear any of the sound you deliver
Me and my partners never see any of the hateful frowning you give us
Cause we splat little bitty braggin' wack rappers
You happen to be the bastard that got mashed up
Adapt to the simple fact here's a strap at ya, blast at ya
That's after the gap when I put the cash in my last chapter, that's laughter
Had passed a vast money bag, imagine a black Dracula
Smashin' 'em with the gas, upper class stature
It went to my head as my first time
To be cocky, I'm just a giant when I burst rhyme
My leg is humongous, is ya'll's verse mine?
Step on the mic, I can't stop my leg like Robert Klein
Giant robot make you feel very low shaint
I am so hot, in my skills there be propane
Why I'm gon' squash them and kill every poor thang?
Cause I'm a huge... Pillsbury dough mane

[Hook]
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
Yeah Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
That's what they say
(He's a mental giant)
To those who nay-say
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Narcissistic, hard to grip it
Dark and wicked, art's prolific
Mars with the stars, this is far lifted
Lyrics, quit the Bawitdaba, scriptures are terrific
Get a spitter with a bit of bitter marketed
With scrilla then a fifth of Henny liquor, start to twist it
Critters sit and shiver in the slit of zillas
Pit of killers, gritters hit a click of silly niggas are fictitious
On top of the game, I'm dropping the rain, Godly gifted
Hop in your lane and stopping your fame, bark is vicious
You got bars to witness, ya'll submissive
When I get your brain your thoughts is shifted
I'm incredible, highly technical meant for triumph, raw intricate
I need medical then more science, scars and stitches
Alphabetical gems blow by him, pause it a bit
Tech N9ne a mental giant!

[Hook]
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
Yeah! Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
That's what they say
(He's a mental giant)
To those who nay-say
Hey, hey

[Verse 3]
Mentally I'm like Shaq on stilts
Strange Music Inc. is white and black on built
For keeping rap on tilt
Like drinking Patron and Jack prone then yack on silk quilts
Got a fat dome that'll last long if that's where I'm skilled
Giant, huge, humongous, gigantic, expanded
Been floating for years and I ain't landed
Haters can't stand it the way that my noggin is big as Kansas
But the women that listen wanna know if I'm talking 'bout my damn dick

[Hook]
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
That's what they say
(He's a mental giant)
To those who nay-say
Hey, hey
Y'all are not!

[Outro]
Yadda, they think my head big... Ask her if my head big. Haha, yadda! Yeah, Tech N9ne!---Lyrics submitted by alex juggalo.
