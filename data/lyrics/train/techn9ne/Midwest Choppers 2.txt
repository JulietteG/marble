[Intro]I
 We scoured the globe on a quest to find the most elite
 Most intricate tongues of all time
 California, New York, Denmark, Australia
 Then a cold wind from the Midwest brought the hardest
 Fastest, most accurate tongues ever heard in our lifetime
 These are the Midwest Choppers

[K-Dean]
 I got a message for any one of you muthafuckin niggaz
 That wanna talk 'bout the Mid-Midwest
 We dangerous, Aim to bust any little nigga with a big-big chest
 Anybody that wanna be comin thinkin they hotter
 I'm a type of nigga that'll really kill ya for dollas
 Fuck everybody that want a piece of a killa
 For real, Me and my niggaz will leave you floatin in a river
 So fuck all you haters, You heard what I said
 My flow a little bit over your head
 Act like a pencil, I'll fill you with led
 If you afraid, Then tell me you scared
 Cause imma little bit out of my muthafuckin mind
 The hardest rapper that Tecca N9na could fuckin find
 Who that? Who that? That's me
 Who that? Who that? K-Dean
 When I was comin up in the game everybody was tellin me
 "I really be killin a lot of you niggaz, I'm mean"
 Fuckin with my niggaz D-Loc and Dalima
 They told me, "I really gotta be a muderer killin machine"
 I didn't care about nothing but rappin my way to the top
 Fuckin with my nigga Tech, He told me I'm hot
 Anybody got a problem with any one of my niggaz
 I'll pulled out the 9 milli up and to a pop
 Bring the heat, Bring the noise, Bring the flames
 Anything that you bring, Imma tame
 Puttin dirt on the top of my name
 Pull back and I click-click, bang
 Ask Tech, He'll tell you I'm strange
 If you ever wanna talk about me
 Imma run up, Gun up and leave you with no brain
 Then you'll know my flow is insane

[Chorus]
 I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
 I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
 Even though I'm all up in the Northwest
 All across the U.S.
 Overseas, Midwest Choppers

Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
 Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Yeah, Midwest Choppers)
 Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
 Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Nigga, Midwest Choppers)

[Krayzie Bone]
 Come, come get some of this Midwest murda music
 Murda music, murda music
 Come, come get some of this Midwest murda music
 Murda music, murda music
 [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tech_n9ne/midwest_choppers_2.html ]
 Let me hit 'em
 When I get 'em, Imma split 'em, Imma kill 'em
 I'm the nigga with the lyrical venom, Finna get up in them
 When they give me the instrumental
 I finish 'em, diminish 'em
 I guarantee the murda is a minimum
 But lately I been givin 'em hell
 They don't really wanna see me, I'm so damn swell
 Call me a monster, Verse Designer, First To bomb ya
 Leathaface pullin up in that hearse beside ya
 Murda, mo murda, mo murda, mo murdered 'em all, kill 'em all
 Krayzie kill 'em all, they fall
 It's a lyrical execution
 We snap faster, We the rap masters
 Squeeze the gat, Blast it, If that's how it gots to be
 So they better get it ready
 Cause I'm heated like an AK-47 spittin bullet fuckin lyrics out of me
 Well that's somethin, That's crazy, Jackson
 He's amazin action, Stay in action
 Rap singin at ya, I'm blazin at ya
 I'm kinda like an automatic aimin at ya
 And I don't want a little bit of flame to ashes
 You know you really truely insane to madness
 You're never gonna find other niggaz more scandalous
 Than this Midwest blastin famly

[Chorus]
 I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
 I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
 Even though I'm all up in the Northwest
 All across the U.S.
 Overseas, Midwest Choppers

Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
 Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Yeah, Midwest Choppers)
 Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
 Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Nigga, Midwest Choppers)

[Tech N9ne]
 I am the definition of murda
 The N9ne is now coming to serve ya
 You're running but you can't go no furtha
 Cause I'm running through you with no sign of inertia

Gimme the mic and I bet that you duck
 It's what you betta do when I'm bussin
 I be flippin, I'm incredible, Never get on my level
 I'm a killa with the pedal to the medal
 You're edible and ya death is so inevitable
 I can take it to ya momma, Ya daddy, The back of a caddy
 You cut up in the sack with a baggy and I wanna... 
Take it out and make it patty
 You gotta be patty
 Cause that'll be bad if you decide to mad, Is you gonna?
 You can listen to me and see I'm the nigga with the ammunition
 I'm givin the livin a vision of death
 Makin 'em sick and depressed
 Cause I be givin everything
 I'm a rebel and I'm still with the quick and the best
 Makin 'em walk in the business
 Say get up in it to rip and diminish ya
 Trip and I finish ya
 Dig it, You really get me livid, I'm bout give it a pivot
 Imma stick it so we can differ to sinister
 I be the chopper that got ya little boppers goin off us
 Better not let me up on the premises
 Cause I'm a doctor that's out for the shotaz when I brought ya
 Be cautious never talk of this nemesis
 We on top of the hill when it come to the skill
 Other rappers are damn jokers
 They be givin the people comedy
 But the Tecca N9na misery shit is Bram Stoker

[Chorus]
 I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
 I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
 Even though I'm all up in the Northwest
 All across the U.S.
 Overseas, Midwest Choppers

Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
 Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Yeah, Midwest Choppers)
 Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
 Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Nigga, Midwest Choppers)---Lyrics submitted by Ryan Covington.
