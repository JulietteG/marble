'N organize drive bys to have you n ya neighbor hurt
Or send a couple guys to have you n ya neighbor murked
To show you I ain't playin, fuck around, n knock ya neighbor first

Who you think Tech gonn' call to make sure that the dirt get done?

Beats bangin', better bring it big or bounce bitch
'Bout to blast it n blood in back'a the black brick
Boss ballin' been breakin' bread n biquets bre
And Beautiful biancas, bideos, 'n bangas with big B
Bow before brilliancs, blessed to be buildin it
Best in this bario, bane, 'n bizarre more bills in this
Bankin' this babies be blingin 'n his boo be the BIG booty,
Big bust, be in'is benzo bronze'll get big bucks
I'm a black babboon, bring me bags of bananas
Bonified billy badass with a brown bandana
Been gone on Bicardi, bulu, but I'm bout to be bigger bit
Better break if you bust up before I'm blowed n biligerent
Six Douce spreads big in it, I'm bloated n blimpy
Broads be blowin me in the back of the black Bently
Never been about no babbelin, I'm bringin no bootsy,
But I been in Bay with Big Von, like sha-boob-a-la-boopy/

[Bumpy Knuckles:]
Yo, it's the OG Bumpy Knucks, knucks, I rolls with them B-Boys.

Guarentee you gonn' get clapped up-up
See I'm the beast, you the bitch, I'm better battlin babe

And for the record nigga, check mines 'n you will find that I shoot legendary status, Leave ya fu-fu

Crack a nigga whole act, I'm like a jaw breaker
Knock you out, 'n hit them pockets like a cold hand

They said my music was strange until I made me some change,
'N now they ridin' my nuts-nuts

Ya'll niggas better duck-duck!
