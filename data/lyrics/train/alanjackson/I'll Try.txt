Here we are
Talkin' bout forever
Both know damn well
It's not easy together

We've both felt love
We've both felt pain
I'll take the sunshine
Over the rain

And I'll try
To love only you
And I'll try
My best to be true
Oh darlin', I'll try

So I'm not scared
It's worth a chance to me
Take my hand
Let's face eternity

Well I can't tell you
That I'll never change
But I can swear
That in every way

And I'll try
To love only you
And I'll try
My best to be true
Oh darlin', I'll try

I'm not perfect
Just another man
But I will give you
All that I am

And I'll try
To love only you
And I'll try
My best to be true
Oh darlin', I'll try

I'll try
To be true to you
I'll try
I'll try
To always love you
I'll try---
