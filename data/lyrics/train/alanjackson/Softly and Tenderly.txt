Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
Patiently Jesus is waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

Come home, come home
He who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling all sinner come home

All for the wonderful He has promised
Promised for you and for me
Thou we have sinned He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me

Come home, come home
He who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling all sinner come home

Come home, come home
He who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling all sinner come home---Lyrics submitted by Penny.
