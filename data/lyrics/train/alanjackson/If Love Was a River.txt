If love was a river...And I was a drowning man, 
Would you get in the water,
Would you lend me a hand!!

If love was a river, 
Would you sit on the land!!!

If love was a mountain high above this town
Would you climb to the top?
Would you never look down?

If love was a mountain
Would you go around!!

Love may only knock so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it'll come back, any more

If love was a firefly, sitting in your hand,
Would you laugh when it twinkled, let it go again 

If love was a firefly
Would you understand!!

If love was a party with everyone you know
Would you dance if I ask you?
Would you smile and say no

If love was a party
Would you even go!!

And love may only knock so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it'll come back, any more

If love was a fast train, on a one- way track
Would you turn in your ticket 
Would you never look back?

If love was a fast train
Would you even pack!!---Lyrics submitted by Carolyn.
