If you want to drive a big limousine
I'll buy the longest one you've ever seen
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
On all the waters and the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
If you want to own a great big mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
On all the waters and the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
Well I'm a fool, a fool for you
It may take awhile, but I'll prove it's true
Well if it's lovin' you want, then I've got it
If it's money you want, then I'll get it
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
On all the waters and the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you (Yahoo)

If you want to take a trip across the ocean

I'll travel anywhere you take a notion
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
On all the waters and the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
If you want to own a great big mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
On all the waters and the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
Well I'm a fool, a fool for you
It may take awhile, but I'll prove it's true
Well if it's lovin' you want, then I've got it
If it's money you want, then I'll get it
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
On all the waters and the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
Yeah, I'm a fool, fool, fool for you---
