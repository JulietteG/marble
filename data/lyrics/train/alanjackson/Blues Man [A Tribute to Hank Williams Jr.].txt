He's just a singer 
A natural born guitar ringer 
Kind of a clinger to sad old songs 
He's not a walk behinder 
He's a new note finder 
His name's a reminder of a blues man 
That's already gone 
So he started drinking and took somethings 
That meesed up his thinking 
He was sure sinking when she came along 
He was born in the spot light not to much left inside 
She changed all that one night 
When she sang him this song 

Hey baby I love you 
Hey baby I need you 
Hey baby you ain't got to prove to me 
Your some kind of macho man 
You wasted so much of your life running through the dark nights 
Let me shine a little love light down on the blues man 

He got so sick of speeding all things 
They said he was needing if he was to keep on pleasing all of his fans 
He got cuffed on dirt roads 
He got sued over no shows 
She came and took all that old down off of that blues man 

And he sang 
Hey baby I love you to 
Hey baby I need you 
Hey baby I do get tired of this traveling band 
I'm over 40 years old now 
Nights would be so cold now i
If you hadn't stuck it out with this blues man 

I'm over 40 years old now 
Nights would be so cold now 
If she hadn't hung around with that blues man---Lyrics submitted by dudley.
