Night time, sharpens, 
Heightens each sensation.
Darkness stirs, 
And wakes imagination.
Silently the senses, 
Abandon their defences.
Helpless to resist the notes I write.,
For I compose the music of the night.

Slowly, gently,
Night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it,
Tremulous and tender.
Turn your face away,
From the garish night and day.
Turn your thought away from cold, unfeeling light,
And listen to the music of the night.

let your mind start a journey,
Through a strange new world.
Leave all thoughts of the life
You knew before.
Let your soul take you
Where you long to be.
Only then, can you belong,
To me.

Floating, falling,
Sweet intoxication.
Touch me, trust me,
Savour each sensation.
Let the dream begin,
Let your darker side give in.
To the power of the music that I write,
The power of the music of the night.

You alone can make my song take flight,
Help me make the music of the night.---Lyrics submitted by Ella.
