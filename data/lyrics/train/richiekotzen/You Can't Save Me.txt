I sold my soul, just so I could feel hate
I broke my heart, so I couldn't feel pain
I lost my faith, cause I can't justify the wait
I've got no hope, thats only for losers and fakes

I'm nothing but a user and gonna abuse her
You don't wanna know whats on my mind
I know Im just a fool but I'm not foolin
Not afraid to make a fool out of myself

And fuck your money
Fuck your fame
Fuck my life I'll walk away
And fuck our love
Fuck I'm sorry for anything I've ever done

(chorus)
You can't save me
You'd better give yourself to someone else
faded
Im Just fallin into my condition
faded
You'd better put your time into something else
Save me
But don't worry bout it now, better save your fuckin self!

I lost my mind, Just so I could escape
I still got time, but I know its too late
I still got friends, to tell me I'm okay
I'm still alive, but I keep on testin fate

I'm nothing but a user and gonna abuse her
You don't wanna know whats on my mind
I'm nothin but a fool but I'm not foolin
Not afraid to make a fool out of myself

And fuck your money
Fuck your fame
Fuck my life I walk away
And fuck our love
Fuck I'm sorry for anything I've ever done

(chorus)
You can't save me
You'd better give yourself to someone else
faded
I'm Just fallin into my condition
faded
You'd better put your time in something else
Save me
But don't worry bout it now, better save your fuckin self

Try just a little
Understand what I'm tellin you
I'm not what you think
It started off doin the right thing
Life got in the way
I don't know what to say
I'm not askin why

You can't save me
You'd better give yourself to someone else
Faded
Fallin into my condition
Faded
You'd better spend your time on something else
Save me
But don't worry bout it now, better save your fuckin self---Lyrics submitted by William.
