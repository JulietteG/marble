02: you move me:
i saw you standing there
underneath the window of my soul
and i couldn't keep from hoping that
someday you, i could hold
you move me,
i can't keep from trying,
no one is mine in my mind like you now
i only wish i could hold you now

nobody knows and no one cares
that i can't keep from looking at you - i stare
if i had one wish it would be
to tell you that i  long to hold you near me

you move me,
i can't keep from trying,
no one is mine in my mind like you now
though i don't know you in my heart
i hold you - wish i could hold you now
you move me

you don't know me, like i know you
i wanna know your name
i wanna show you about me

i'm wondering will i lose the way?
will there be no me?
will i live in misery?
with out you...
