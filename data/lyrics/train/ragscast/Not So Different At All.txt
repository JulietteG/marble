The bright lights is flashing
I'm surrounded by madness
Yellow cabs is passing
I'm just trying to make it

Something special to me
Change falls at my feet
Big dreams of Hollywood
Won't you come take a closer look?

I'm seeing the bright lights, the fancy cars
Cover of magazines
That's what I want
But if you could look inside my heart
Then you will see
Come a little bit closer
We're not so different at all

At all
At all
Hey, we're not so different at all
At all
At all
Hey, we're not so different at all

You looking at me
Tell me what you see
You should know we're not so different at all
The shoot for the stars
I think we'll go far
Believe me 'cause we're not so different

I see you on the big screen
You see me chasing my dreams
We kinda do the same thing
We're not so different, are we?
It's nothing to it
Together we can do this
It's only just a matter, a matter, a matter of time

I'm seeing the bright lights, the fancy cars
Cover of magazines
That's what I want
But if you could look inside my heart
Then you will see
Come a little bit closer
We're not so different at all

At all
At all
Hey, we're not so different at all
At all
At all
Hey, we're not so different at all

I'm looking at you
We're similar, too
Don't you see we're not so different at all?
I know where I'm from
A kid from the slums
But you see we're not so different

My music's on the corner
Your music's got me on ya
It plays throughout the city
And I don't think I'm dreaming, baby
I'm gonna do it
Pursue my dream in music
It's only just a matter, a matter, a matter of time

I see the bright lights, the fancy cars
I'ma live my dream
Gonna go real far
If you look inside my heart
Then you will see
So come a little bit closer
We're not so different at all

At all
We're not so different at all
At all
We're not so different at all

What's up?
I'm dreaming
I'm living it up
It's true, I love what I do, yeah
No, I'm never giving it up
Throw me the ball
I'll hit it out the park
Just a little light trying to get out of the dark
And even when I shine, I'll never stop
Yeah, yeah, dark child

I see the bright lights, the fancy cars
I'ma live my dream
Gonna go real far
If you look inside my heart
Then you will see
So come a little bit closer

We're not so different at all
At all
We're not so different at all
At all
We're not so different at all ---
