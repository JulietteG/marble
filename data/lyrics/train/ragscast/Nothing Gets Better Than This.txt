Hey!
 Oh, oh oh oh oh
 Oh Oh
 Oh, oh oh oh oh
 Na do do do do
 Oh, oh oh oh oh
 Oh Oh
 Oh, oh oh oh oh

Nothin gets better than
 Havin all the treasure
 Instruments to radios
 iPods, stereo
 You can sell whatever, like magical, sweaters
 Even if its old you can sell it
 We will buy it

Oh, oh oh oh oh
 Oh Oh
 Oh (hey) oh oh oh oh
 At the pawn shop
 Oh, oh oh oh oh
 Oh Oh
 Oh, oh oh oh oh

Everything is better
 Not goin home, not ever
 Ear phones and diamond rings
 Gold chains, silver reeds
 It doesnt really matter, toys if you rather
 Bring it down well pay it today, yeah

Oh, oh oh oh oh
 Oh Oh
 Oh, oh oh oh oh
 [x2]


Its like a party at the pawn shop,
 Just havin a good time
 Look around youll find everything you can describe
 Gold chains, video games
 Just bought my girl a diamond ring

Not goin home tonight
 Everything here just feels ri-ight!

The apple of my eye
 This store is like oh-my!
 Those rows right there so hot
 Im rockin out

Im so much better now
 Blast these speakers up on loud
 You lovin this pawn shop?
 Everybody scream and shout!

Oh, oh oh oh oh
 Oh Oh
 Oh, oh oh oh oh
 Nothin gets better than this!
