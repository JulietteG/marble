(feat. Keke Palmer)

Oh oh! Oh oh oh oh! Oh!

Beauty in the mirror
You see what I see
I can see all that you want from me
I hear something strong, yeah!
It sounds like my name
But if I ain't sad
Are ya talking to me?
You say the sun's brighter
The moonlights behind ya

The world's a playground
Pick a right and you'll see
Sometimes you'll go up and
Sometimes you'll go down then
Sometimes you must fly
So that you can be free

When you feel you took your last breath
I promise you got more left
There's a chance if you take it
Don't be afraid to just dance

Look, look at me now! (Look at me now)
I'm starting to be stronger
There's no time to stop now, no!
Oh! I'm touching the clouds
I'm flying higher and higher
I'm not trying to come down
Can you look at me now?
Can you look at me now?

Nothing's impossible
The spark is in you
Light up the whole world
And just look, look, look at me now

When I look up at the stars
Even though they may be far away
It's okay, I can reach them
Won't ever change who I am
I'll make the world understand me
From beginning to end, end!
Oooohhhh!

Look, look at me now! (Look at me now)
I'm starting to be stronger
There's no time to stop now, no!
Oh! I'm touching the clouds
I'm flying higher and higher
I'm not trying to come down
Can you look at me now?
Can you look at me now?

Nothing's impossible
The spark is in you
Light up the whole world
And just look, look, look at me now ---
