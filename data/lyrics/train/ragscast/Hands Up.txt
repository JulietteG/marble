(feat. Max Schneider)

(1st Verse)
Oh oh here I go
On my way to hit the club
Grab my bags I'm out the door
Ain't got no worries no more
Oh oh here I go
On the train I'm in my zone
Everybody like where he go
I can't wait to hit the floor

(Pre-Chorus)
It's tonight(X2)
Feels like I'm on top
It's tonight(X2)
The party's going on
It's tonight(X2)
I don't want it to stop
It's tonight(X5)

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm having a good time (X2)
No worries I'm gonna get mine
Tonight I'm having a good time
Now get your Hands Up
Oh oh get your Hands Up(X4)

(2nd Verse)
Oh oh letting go
All my problems out the door
I'm not stressing it no more
Party party here we go
Oh oh there I go
Sneaking out up out the door
Everybody like where he go
I'm getting down on the floor

(Pre-Chorus)
It's tonight(X2)
Feels like I'm on top
It's tonight(X2)
The party's going on
It's tonight(X2)
I don't want it to stop
It's tonight(X5)

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm having a good time (X2)
No worries I'm gonna get mine
Tonight I'm having a good time
Now get your Hands Up
Oh oh get your Hands Up(X4)
(3rd Verse)
Tonight is turning out to be something so good to me
Everyone is getting low
There ain't no stopping we
Oh oh lets get those Hands Up(X4)
Oh oh ain't nothing stopping us

(Pre-Chorus)
It's tonight(X2)
Feels like I'm on top
It's tonight(X2)
The party's going on
It's tonight(X2)
I don't want it to stop
It's tonight(X5)

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm having a good time (X2)
No worries I'm gonna get mine
Tonight I'm having a good time
Now get your Hands Up
Oh oh get your Hands Up(X4)---
