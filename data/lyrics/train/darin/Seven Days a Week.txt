Ooh oh oh ooh
Ooh oh oh ooh
We've been talking on the phone for hours and hours
You can give me a call whenever you like to
And if you would fall you know I will catch you
Yeah I'll stick around, I'll be right beside you
Whooo oh oh...
I'm sure you always knew what you had to do
And I'm sure you had your reasons you change 'em every season
Hold on, hold on
I'm taking a vacation, I'll se you at the station
Hey, hey, hey
Seven days a week, every minute of the day
Oh whooo oh oh, whooo oh oh
I've been thinking about you and what you've been up to
Seven days a week, every minute of the day
Oh whooo oh oh, whooo oh oh
Girl you're living in danger you're sleeping with strangers
No nothing can change us, no nothing can keep us from falling, from falling
We've been talking on the phone for hours and hours
You can give me a call whenever you like to
Yeah I'll stick around, I'll be right beside you
Whooo ohh ohh...
Girl you're out of your mind, you're my partner in crime
And I'm sure you had your reasons you change 'em every season
Hold on, hold on
I'm taking a vacation, I'll se you at the station
Hey, hey, hey
Seven days a week, every minute of the day
Oh whooo oh oh, whooo oh oh
I've been thinking about you and what you've been up to
Seven days a week, every minute of the day
Oh whooo oh oh, whooo oh oh
Girl you're living in danger you're sleeping with strangers
No nothing can change us, no nothing can keep us from falling, from falling
And I'm sure you had your reasons you change 'em every season
Just hold on, yeah hold on
I'm taking a vacation, I'll se you at the station
Hey, hey, hey
Seven days a week, every minute of the day
Oh whooo oh oh, whooo oh oh
I don't wanna change you, I just wanna see you
Even days a week, every minute of the day
Oh whooo oh oh, whooo oh oh
Girl you're living in danger you're sleeping with strangers
No nothing can change us, no nothing can keep us from falling, from falling
Oho ho ohoo---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
