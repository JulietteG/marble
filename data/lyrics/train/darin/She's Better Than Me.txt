I need to catch my breath
I think Ill step outside
When she comes down the stairs
I feel so sick inside
Wondering if shell ever look this way again
I blend into the furniture
Thats all I am to her

And every time she looks at me I trick myself
Into thinking we could be
Something bigger than the both of us
But we cant
Cause shes better than me

Id have given up both my arms and
Legs that day
Just to have one stroke of good fortune
Come into play
I was just believing in myself again,
And then I showed up at her door
What did I do that for

Id like to think that just because she doesn't like
What I have to offer
Doesn't mean that she doesn't like me
But it does
Cause shes better than me

Every day is the same, out of sight, out of mind
Another slap in the face might help me decide
Should I open a vein, or look again through the blinds
To catch another glimpse of her and her---Lyrics submitted by akeem roden.
