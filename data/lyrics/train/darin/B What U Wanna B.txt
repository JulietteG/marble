Doctor, actor, lawyer or a singer
Why not president, be a dreamer
You can be just the one you wanna be
Police man, fire fighter or a post man
Why not something like your old man
You can be just the one you wanna be
Doctor, actor, lawyer or a singer
Why not president, be a dreamer
You can be just the one you wanna be

I know that we all got one thing
That we all share together
We got that one nice dream
We live for
You never know what life could bring
Coz nothing last for ever
Just hold on to the team
You play for

I know you could reach the top
Make sure that you won't stop
Be the one that you wanna be
Now sing this with me

Doctor, actor, lawyer or a singer
Why not president, be a dreamer
You can be just the one you wanna be
Police man, fire fighter or a post man
Why not something like your old man
You can be just the one you wanna be

We may have different ways to think
But it doesn't really matter
We all caught up in the steam
Of this life
Focus on every little thing
That's what does really matter
Luxury cars and bling
That's not real life

I know you could reach the top
Make sure that you won't stop
Be the one that you wanna be
Now sing this with me

Doctor, actor, lawyer or a singer
Why not president, be a dreamer
You can be just the one you wanna be
Police man, fire fighter or a post man
Why not something like your old man
You can be just the one you wanna be

Last year I used to dream about this day
Now I'm here I'm singing for you
I hope I could inspire you
Coz I've got all the love, coz I've got all love for you

Doctor, actor, lawyer or a singer
Why not president, be a dreamer
You can be just the one you wanna be
Police man, fire fighter or a post man
Why not something like your old man
You can be just the one you wanna be

Doctor, actor, lawyer or a singer
Why not president, be a dreamer
You can be just the one you wanna be
Police man, fire fighter or a post man
Why not something like your old man
You can be just the one you wanna be

Doctor, actor, lawyer or a singer
Why not president, be a dreamer
You can be just the one you wanna be
Police man, fire fighter or a post man
Why not something like your old man
You can be just the one you wanna be---Lyrics submitted by RaymondWong.
