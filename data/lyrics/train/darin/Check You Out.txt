Stopped in my tracks
Caught in her eyes
And my hearts beating fast
And all that chemo was this corny lie

I hope that you know CPR
Cause girl you take my breath away
No, I cant believe that I just said that
What I really meant to say

Is that I know that smile has broken a couple hearts
Youre used to always getting what you want
Drop dead beautiful, knows how to knock them down
Oh girl, oh girl, check you out

Yeah, that smile has broken a couple hearts
Youre used to always getting what you want
Drop dead beautiful, knows how to knock them down
Oh girl, oh girl, check you out

I tried to relax
But my tongue kept getting tied
The star and land
But nothing seemed to come out right

Girl, I know you must be tired
Cause youve been running through my mind all day
Yeah, I know I cant believe that I just said that
What I really meant to say

Is that I know that smile has broken a couple hearts
Youre used to always getting what you want
Drop dead beautiful, knows how to knock them down
Oh girl, oh girl, check you out

Yeah, that smile has broken a couple hearts
Youre used to always getting what you want
Drop dead beautiful, knows how to knock them down
Oh girl, oh girl, check you out

Oh-oh-oh-oh, ch-ch-ch-check you out
Oh-oh-oh-oh, check you out
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ch-ch-ch-check you out
Oh-oh-oh-oh, check you out

Oh, that smile has broken a couple hearts
That, that smile has broken, that smile
Yeah, I know I cant believe that I just said that
What I really meant to say

Check you out
Yeah, that smile has broken a couple hearts
Youre used to always getting what you want
Drop dead beautiful, knows how to knock them down
Oh girl, oh girl, check you out

Oh-oh-oh-oh, ch-ch-ch-check you out
Youre used to always getting what you want
Drop dead beautiful, knows how to knock them down
Oh girl, oh girl, check you out

Check you out,
Oh girl, oh girl, check you out
Check you out,
Oh girl, oh girl, check you out---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
