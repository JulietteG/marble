Im lost in the streets in the city of pain
I learned how to cry, how to go insane
Your love, because of your love

The gypsy woman in the corner knows my name
But still she couldnt tell when youre back again
Your love, because of your love

Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows

Can you feel my heart
I can feel your speed
Faster every second
Dancing to the beat
Whats love, nobody knows

Trapped in the fire used to see in your eyes
Swallowing my pride struggling to stay alive
Your love, because of your love

I'm looking like power cause I know how to hide
The scars and the hours I pretend to be fine
Your love, because of your love

Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows

Can you feel my heart
I can feel your speed
Faster every second
Dancing to the beat
Whats love, tell me whats love

(Nobody knows)

Can you feel my heart
I can feel your speed (Nobody knows)
Faster every second
Dancing to the beat (Nobody knows)
Whats love, nobody knows

What is love
Do we know, do we know
What is love
Do we know, do we know

(Nobody knows)

Can you feel my heart
I can feel your speed
Faster every second
Dancing to the beat
Whats love, tell me whats love

(Nobody knows)

Can you feel my heart
I can feel your speed (Nobody knows)
Faster every second
Dancing to the beat (Nobody knows)
Whats love, nobody knows---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
