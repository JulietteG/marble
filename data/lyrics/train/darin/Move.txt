Woo, oohh
Move, move, move, move

Jumping in the tour bus, I can't explain
This feeling is insane
Ready here I go to play my game
It ain't gonna be the same
Putting my clothes on heading to the show
Lights off, lights on, boom it's on
Getting up on the stage
Won't you step up, move with me

From town to town
I'll bring you my kinda party
Let us make history
If you down with it, just go with it

Move, throw them up, put your hands up to the sealing
Move, shake it up, don't you try to hide that feeling
Move, front to back, them side to side we're leaning
Move, you want it, you'll get it
I'm gonna make you move

Move, move, move, move

Been waiting so long to live my, dream
Guess now I control the scene
From TV, to radio, to magazines
Backed up with the finest team
Came to do my thing, I ain't never gonna stop

Step by step I made it to the top
Here's my sound, and here's my steps
Time to get up, move with me

From town to town
I'll bring you my kinda party
Let us make history
If you down with it, just go with it

Move, throw them up, put your hands up to the sealing
Move, shake it up, don't you try to hide that feeling
Move, front to back, them side to side we're leaning
Move, you want it, you'll get it
I'm gonna make you move

Ahh ahh you can do this ahh ahh now follow me

If you feel this groove just show it
Right here right now let's do it
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
