I can't get you, get you off my mind
I can't get you, get you off my mind
I'm hanging 'round the phone
Waiting for a call,
I would it give my all just to hear you say hello!
But hunny...

I can't get you, get you off my mind
I can't get you, get you off my mind
I clean the house a thousand times
Just to get my mind on something else
I go drinking with the girls
To quit thinking about you
But hunny...

I cant' get you, get you off my mind
And I can't get you, get you off my mind
And I can't get you, get you off my mind
I cant' get you, get you off my mind
ohh no, noo

I don't know what to do
You're everywhere I turn
And everywhere I go
But I'll try to cut you out of my life
Just as you cut me out of yours
oh oh uh uh

I can't get you, get you off my mind
I can't get you, get you off my mind
I can't get you, get you off my mind
I can't get you, get you off my mind---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
