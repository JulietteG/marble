You may deny, you love me 
You may deny, you care
you may deny, you got it bad
But you can't deny darling
A love affair is what we have

You may deny, you miss me 
And all the things you say 
But you can't deny darling
A love affair is what we have

So don't pretend it's cool 
Don't you remember you are a fool for me? 
This love affair is cruel 
This love affair is killing me 

You may deny, you love me
You may deny, you care
But you can't deny darling
A love affair is what we have


(now)
You expect me to forget the way you smiled,
and the way you burnt your lips on me. x2

So don't pretend it's cool
Don't you remember you are a fool me? 
This love affair is cruel 
This love affair is killing me x2---Lyrics submitted by Saskia.
