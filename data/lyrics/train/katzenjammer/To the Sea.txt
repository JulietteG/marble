The wind is a'whipping through the open doors
Speaking of the sea and the rolling' waves
Maybe there's a ship at the bottom now
or struggling on the surface with a cry for help
Wish I could forget and let the years go by
Wish I could escape from my dreams of you 
Twenty years ago it was a howling storm
as the voice of a god from a great beyond
I was standing on the shore as the sky grew dark
with a hand on a bible and a hand on my heart
Wish I could forget and let the years go by
Wish I could escape from my dreams of you 

Because all I have left is the voice of the wind
Blowing through the doors of our house 

The sun was drying up the rain in our sky
Shining gold in our sails and 
our hearts standing by
Remember what they're singing 
on their way to the sea:
"Goodbye fare thee well, goodbye for me"
Wish I could forget and let the years go by
Wish I could escape from my dreams of you 

Empty were the coffins and 
the house where we lived
as the grave that I dug 
by our place on the beach
How I wish the water could 
be poured out of the sea
so I can go and get you back ashore with me
Wish I could forget and let the years go by
Wish I could escape from my dreams of yor---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
