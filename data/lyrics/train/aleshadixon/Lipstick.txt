So are you ready... 
yeah... 
come on... 

let's do it... 

whoo yeah - whoo yeah 
all my ladies 

Let's do it.. 

All my ladies... 

I know the girls inside 
they want to get on with the ladies 
But there are always fellows there to stir or make you crazy 
They try to get you flaky 
Can't find a bus no maybe's 
You think that girl is a trader 
But them *** instigator 

Turn it up with your jewelry on 
Make your moves with your lipstick on 
Want some of that cousy stuff 

Wooowoohoo - Wooowoohoo 

Let's jump when the music is on 
All my girls living up till dawn 
Want a little bit - sing this song 

Why do you think that every girl out there's your enemy 
Your luck no matter with the green I feel of jalousy 
It's not the way it is supposed to be 
So come on ladies dance with me 
And I tell you .. no no no no-no-no no no no no nooo 

Turn it up with your jewelry on 
Make your moves with your lipstick on 
Want some of that cousy stuff 

Wooowoohoo - Wooowoohoo 

Let's jump when the music is on 
All my girls living up till dawn 
Want a little bit - sing this song 

Wooowoohoo - Wooowoohoo 

Let's feel the rhythm, everybody gotta to lose control 
All my ladies get together we will get on a roll 
Feel it in your soul 
If you move it get them down 
It's time to look around 

You got to think about it 
You'll beat them up yourself 

Turn it up with your jewelry on 
Make your moves with your lipstick on 
Want some of that cousy stuff 

Wooowoohoo - Wooowoohoo 

Let's jump when the music is on 
All my girls living up till dawn 
Want a little bit - sing this song 

Turn it up with your jewelry on 
Make your moves with your lipstick on 
Want some of that cousy stuff 

Wooowoohoo - Wooowoohoo 

Want some of that cousy stuff 

Wooowoohoo - yeah yeah 

Want a little bit - sing this song---Lyrics submitted by kafiya.
