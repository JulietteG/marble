Said her name was Marie
From the banks of the Lee
With the prettiest eyes my own had ever seen
Her hair like ripples
They danced with the tide
As our hearts washed away to the sea
Was she sent down from the heavens above
Her breath pure as whiskey my heart fell in love
Now the devil is courtin' a different tune
And I laugh as the tears was the rain

Tell me why no one`s listenin'
Is there nothing at all left to say
In a world so unforgiving
You mean more to me each every day
So may the living be dead in our wake

One cold winters night behind the clouds stars did hide
And the ghost of our souls thanking Christ
we`re alive
Our spirits they crackled with lovers first sight
Till the mornin' came fresh with a new
Will you dance with me now heavens child sang
the clown
We`ve nothing left to lose but your wings and
my frown
Where over the hills the valleys will ring
To the sound of our love singin' true

Tell me why no one`s listenin'
Is there nothing at all left to say
In a world so unforgiving
You mean more to me each every day
So may the living be dead in our wake

But the summer sun is melting now
With the leaves I`ll soon be gone
Will you have the strength when the emptiness
shadows fall
Or will your aching heart be ripped apart
By the beating from the storm
Or will howling gales like yesterdays be gone
Yeah be gone... be gone

Was she sent down from the heavens above
Her breath pure as whiskey my heart fell in love
Now the devil is courtin' a different tune
And I laugh as the tears was the rain

Tell me why no one`s listenin'
Is there nothing at all left to say
In a world so unforgiving
You mean more to me each every day
So may the living be dead in our wake---
