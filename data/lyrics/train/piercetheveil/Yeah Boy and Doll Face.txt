Were you honest when you said I could never leave your bed?
Wake me up and let me know your alive
And will you fall in love again?
Is this scent slowly spreading?
I've been answering machines all night

And are the doctors dancing in while the ambulances sang, another boy without a sharper knife.

The moment that's where I.....
Kill the conversation, wrap this up with a knife that loves to feel
How do you know how deep to go before its real?
Take me home

Can I even complicate your breathing?
I guess I'm just your average boy.

This is me With a knife in the back and a grip on the grass,
 its cold And I don't wanna be here

I guess I'm never comfortable or situational.

Are we losing or beginning?
To try a new life without you

The moment that's where I.....
Kill the conversation, wrap this up with a lie that I'm enjoying every minute with myself

And she could make hell feel just like home, 
so I'm never leaving her alone.
But if your lightning lips aren't mine
Then I don't know the awkward stranger to my right.
But she's crying, I only need one hand to drive.

When your with me, You are my getaway.
Oh no
And don't you ever feel alone
And don't you wish you were home, cut the lust tonight

Alright, Alright tell me why my little mona lisa told a lie
Do you want me
Do you want me to let me know that your ok
A diamond gold ring customized to cut your circulation 
But I couldn't let you go
No, I never let you go my dear
So keep talking cuz I love to hear your voice
Your voice again---Lyrics submitted by cierra.
