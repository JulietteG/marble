don't react, when i tell you
and don't react, when i tell you 

if bright lights mean nothing to you 
cause no one would know the sound of the ghost 
and i might be something to you beyond beautiful 
its the sound of the ghost

can we lose our minds 
and call it love for the last time?
my darling never rests untill, the darker gets
the best of all we had, can the cold carry on?

when the life means nothing to you 
then no one would know thw sound of the ghost
and i might be perfect with you 
but no one would know so tell me, tell me 

have you ever really danced on the edge?
is something still scarng you?
have you ever really danced on the edge?
the count of 3 is on.
have you ever really danced on the edge?
alright then tell me so.
have you ever really danced on the edge?
just hold my hand and go 

and bright lights means nothing to you 
cause no one would know the sound of the ghost
the sound of the ghost
oh no, one would know the sound of the ghost---Lyrics submitted by Alicia.
