Here we are
Can you tell that story it's my favorite one
You fucking disappointment
I can't entertain you anymore
These stupid states of mind
Everyone punishing me all the time
Why?
But don't cross your boundaries and think that it's cool
Misguided by darkness and lost on the road

But I'm such a sucker for the rain!

Here we are, crashing once again into the center of your moonlit face, our caved in ribs
Your tears, they fall on my tongue and our lips are letting go
We lay on the side of the road

(Go!)

Pull the trigger tight and watch our distances explode. (Explode!)
If Texas is forever, where's your home sweet home?
If anything should happen to me I want you to know
I've loved you since ever since then
Don't dance around me I know what it means
No communication, cannot be received

But Im such a sucker for the rain, yeah

(Here we are!)
Crashing once again into the center of your moonlit face, our caved in ribs
Your tears, they fall on my tongue and our lips are letting go
We lay on the side of the road

(Don't...chase...your...nightmares!)

(Yeah!)

Here we are
Crashing once again into the center of your moonlit face, our caved in ribs
Your tears, they fall, our lips are locked in lemon groves
And I can never let them grow

(On the side of the road)

So take a deep breath and chase it with mine!
Your southern hospitality won't mind ---
