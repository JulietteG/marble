Choke, try to wash you down with something strong
Try but the taste of blood remains
Cold, empty mattresses and falling stars
My, how they start to look the same

So keep in happiness
And torture me while I tell you,
"Let's go in style"
A million hooks around
A million ways to die
Darling, it's cold outside

No, no more eyes to see the sun
You slide into bed while I get drunk
Slow conversations with a gun
Meaning more than I've ever said to anyone
Anyone

So keep in happiness
And torture me while I tell you,
"Let's go in style"
A million hooks around
A million ways to die
Darling, let's go inside
It'll be alright

But last night, you said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables
Almost fought some b**** at the club
Got kicked out of your hotel and lost your shoes
Well, f*** what, am I supposed to be impressed?
You're just another set of bones to lay to rest
I guess its time to say goodnight, I hope you had a really good time

Good time

Ill soon forget the color of your eyes and youll forget mine

So keep in happiness
And torture me while I tell you,
"Let's go in style"
A million hooks around
A million ways to die
Let's go outside
It'll be alright

But last night, you said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables---
