Do you know
I count your heartbeats before you sleep?
I bite my fingernails to bone.
And then I crawl back under the stairwell
To a place I call my home.

I really hope you enjoy the show,
Because for me, it's just a bad day.
You need people like me to feel.

Maybe we're just having too much fun.
Maybe you can't handle yourself,
Staring at me with your lips and tongue.

You'll never know
I don't know where I'm going to sleep tonight.
She said hotels are cheap
And there's one down the street,
But, don't you threaten me with a good time.
Murder the moment.
My God, I'm the serpent.
I'm sorry, I can't see that you truly love me.

Maybe we're just having too much fun.
Maybe you can't handle yourself,
Staring at me with your lips and tongue.
I've been having this dream that we can fly,
So maybe if we never wake up we can see the sky.

Please don't take this out on me,
'cause you're the only thing that's keeping me alive.
And I don't want to wait for the devils that take us,
I would rather end it all tonight.
And if I mean anything to you,
I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.

Maybe we're just having too much fun.
Maybe you can't handle yourself,
Staring at me with your lips and tongue.

I've been having this dream that we can fly,
So darling, close your eyes.
'cause you're about to miss everything (about to miss everything)
'cause you're about to miss everything (about to miss everything)---Lyrics submitted by Jessi Valentine.
