Lets go

I kissed the scars on her skin
I still think you're beautiful
And I don't ever wanna lose my best friend
I screamed out god you vulture
Bring her back or take me with her


Tear it down break the barricade
I want to see what sound it makes
I hate this flavor with a passion 
And I fucking hate the aftertaste

How does it feel how does it feel
Well it feels like I'm on fire
Wake up I know you can hear me

Make me a promise here tonight, love like a tidal wave
Dreamless in early graves I never want it to be this way
The chemicals will bring you home again
This is it when its done we can say that
When its sudden death we fight back

Pretend like I don't entice you
I've seen you circling the sky above my head
You traitor

I will never be taken for granted again
Keep digging holes in the desert
Say a prayer for you

I know that you're in pain
But if we die at the same time does it still scare you

Make me a promise here tonight, lets go
Dreamless in early graves I never want it to be this way
The chemicals will bring you home again
This is it when its done we can say that
Oh my god we're not gonna make it

We will bring the tidal wave [x7]
And nothing will remain

Shes mine you stay away from her it's not her time
'Cause Im the one who haunts her dreams at night
Until shes satisfied

Make me a promise here tonight, love like a tidal wave
Dreamless in early graves I never want it to be this way
The chemicals will bring you home again
This is it when its done we can say that
When its sudden death we fight back.

Fuck it.---Lyrics submitted by Jackie Lopez.
