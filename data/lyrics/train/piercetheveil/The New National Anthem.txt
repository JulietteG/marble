Drag my hand behind you like a chain behind a truck.
Sparks over your carpet while I chase you through the darkness.
Somebody's supposed to fall in love, but nobody even calls.

Somebody's supposed to tear this place apart until you find me hiding, silently I wait.
You'll be excited just to see me someday, everything's okay.

Summer and gold, throw their colors at the dark,.
A mother tells her son, darling look at the sparks.
But you hold my attention without even trying.
A beautiful reflection from firework eyes.
But never means forever.
Desperation, and hanging in the backyard at night.

Somebody's supposed to fall in love.
Tear this place apart until you find me hiding, silenty I wait.
You'll be excited just to see me someday, everything's okay.

Love, Don't forget to bleed so slowly.
Haunted hearts we melt over the fabric of your floor
I'm holdin' her just like she's gold, but I've been running from the sun.
Oh, no, no.
And if I ever catch the ones who hurt you.
I'm hoping that God looks away this time.
So, why would I let you go?
Why would I let you go? Let you go.

Tear apart this place apart until you find me hiding, silently I wait.
You'll be excited just to see me someday, everything's okay---Lyrics submitted by valeria.
