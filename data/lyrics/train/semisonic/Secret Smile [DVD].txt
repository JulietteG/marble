Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

So use it and prove it
Remove this whirlin' sadness
I'm losin', I'm bluesin'
But you can save me from madness

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

So save me, I'm waitin'
I'm needin', hear me pleadin'
And soothe me, improve me
I'm grievin', I'm barely believin' now, now

When you are flyin' around and around the world
And I'm lyin' alonely
I know there's somethin' sacred and free reserved
And received by me only

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

So use it and prove it
Remove this whirlin' sadness
I'm losin', I'm bluesin'
But you can save me from madness now, now

When you are flyin' around and around the world
And I'm lyin' alonely
I know there's somethin' sacred and free reserved
And received by me only

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile

Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret

Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret---
