What a wonderful way to have a day begin 
We should open up those windows let some love shine in
Well honestly I believe dont get no better than this
Well dont get up just yet give me one more kiss

I know youre running behind 
So baby whats another nine minutes
So wont you stay with me dont ever leave this warm bed
Yeah its cold outside baby please dont leave me lonely
Got plenty of time for the grind and the nine to five any other day
So baby stay.

I can see by the way youre lookin at me
And the fact that youre still here says you dont disagree
Well you can hardly believe we only met last night
But Ive been waiting on you baby for a long long time

Its not me to beg and plead, but look at what youre doin
Wont you stay with me dont ever leave this warm bed
Yeah its cold outside dont ever leave me lonely 
Got plenty of time for the grind and the nine to five any other day
So baby stay

Baby lay right here Ill make you breakfast in bed
And Ill write you a song, wont take long to let you know how much I need you 

Stay with me dont ever leave this warm bed
Yeah its cold outside baby please dont leave me lonely 
Got plenty of time for the grind and the nine to five any other day
So baby stay, stay.
Oh now stay, stay.
