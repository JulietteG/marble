Released from reason
Alive with pain
The actors change  
The play's the same
As he and his ministers conversed
I peeked out from behind the well
And oh how I was surprised to learn 
The devil's not the king of hell

The devil is not the king of hell
The devil is not the king of hell
A violent dance on slippery stones
The line's gone dead
We're all alone
The devil is not the king of hell

Smelling victory 
The engine hums
Off in the distance 
They beat the drums
Amidst the blood and rubble 
I looked for souvenirs to sell
And oh how I was surprised to learn 
The devil's not the king of hell

The devil is not the king of hell
The devil is not the king of hell
A violent dance on slippery stones
The line's gone dead 
We're all alone
The devil is not the king of hell

Black was the mark
Black was the mark
Black was the mark laid on Cain
Black was the list 
Black was the list 
Black was the list with our names

Black was the mark
Black was the mark
Black was the mark laid on Cain
Black was the list 
Black was the list 
Black was the list with our names

The devil is not the king of hell
The devil is not the king of hell
A violent dance on slippery stones
The line's gone dead 
We're all alone 
The devil is not the king of hell

Tonight I'm gonna do some things
That I've never done before
I'm gonna find out what the screaming's about 
On the other side of that door
So don't you bother calling
There ain't nobody home
Sometimes we've got to stand together
Sometimes alone

The devil is not the king of hell
The devil is not the king of hell
A violent dance on slippery stones
The line's gone dead
We're all alone
The devil is not the king of hell
The devil is not the king of hell
A violent dance on slippery stones
The line's gone dead
The line's gone dead 
The line's gone dead
The line's gone dead
The devil is not the king of hell---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
