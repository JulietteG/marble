On the streets of New York
The cabs dont stop
On the street where I love
They called the cops
Found a noose in my garage 
Now how 'bout that
So tonight Im in the bushes 
With a baseball bat
Cause Im a one man
I'm a one man
I'm a one man revolution 
I'm a one man
I'm a one man
I'm a one man revolution
The time is nigh 
The day is dark
There's only one solution
I'm a one man
I'm a one man
I'm a one man revolution
On the streets of Havan
I got hugged and kissed
At the Playboy Mansion
I wasnt on the list
On the streets of Cape Town
Shit's ready to blow
I dont know how to get there
But I'm ready to go
Cause I'm a one man
I'm a one man revolution
I'm a one man
I'm a one man
I'm a one man revolution
The time is nigh
The day is dark
There's only one solution
I'm a one man
I'm a one man
I'm a one man revolution
Sacrifice and neon lights
Slaveships dont wait
Love many, trust few
And dont be late
In my nightmares
The streets are aflame
And in my dreams 
It's much the same
And on the streets of L.A.
They know my name
And if you've come this far, mister
Maybe we're one and the same
I'm a one man
I'm a one man
I'm a one man revolution
I'm a one man
I'm a one man
I'm a one man revolution
The time is nigh 
The day is dark
There's only one solution
I'm a one man
I'm a one man
I'm a one man revolution---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
