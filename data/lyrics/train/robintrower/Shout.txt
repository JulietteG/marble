You tell me that you love my stuff
Baby that aint good enough
You tell me that you think Im great
Maybe youre a little late
You say you wanna buy me lunch
Mister you just hit the crunch
You say you wanna hear my views
Sister you aint heard the news

Chorus:
Ive quit the job
Ive shut the shop
Ive hung the rag
And slung the slot
Im giving up my life for art
Sold the horse and smashed the cart
Ive seen the error of my ways
No use living in a daze
No use living in a dream
Sometimes you have to scream

No more howling at the moon
Time to try a different tune
No more staring at the sun
Time to try a different drum
Time to try a different clock
Wind it up and let it rock
Time to kill those nagging doubts
Turn it up and shout it out

Repeat Chorus ---
