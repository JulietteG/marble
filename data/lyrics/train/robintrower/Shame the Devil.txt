Theres a time, for living
And a time for love
Theres a time, for forgiving, yall
And a time to shove
Ohh theres more, won then lost
More hoping here to spare
And its waiting, waiting
Don't ya spend your whole life hesitating
Come and tell the truth
Shame the devil

Theres more, light then dark
Honey shining down on you
More despair, then what you got
And baby you'll need the truth
This whole world, has had enough
Of people giving up
And its waiting, waiting
Don't you spend your whole life hesitating
Come on tell the truth
Shame the devil

And its waiting, waiting
Don't spend your whole life hesitating
Come on tell the truth
Shame the devil
Don't you know that its waiting, ah waiting
Don't you spend your whole life hesitating
Come on, let loose
Shame the devil---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
