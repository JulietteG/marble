[wyclef]
I like the way
The way she dance (ohh!)(haaa! haaa!)
She take the thug
Put 'em in a trance (ohh!)(haaa! haaa!)
She shake her ass
Like an avalanche (haaa!)(ohh!)
Lookin to her eyes (haaa! haaa! haaa!)
And you takin' the chance
I see the fire in her eyes
Fire in here eyes (yeaaah!)
The way she move
She got the fire in her eyes!
Fire on her waist
Fire in her thighs (yeaaah!)
But i love the scandaaaaaaaal

Refrain]
She's so dangerouuuuuuuus (dangerous)
She's so dangerouuuuuuuus (dangerous)
She's so scandolouuuuuuus (scandolous)
I love the scandaaaaaaaal
Hear me sing!
Woooohoooo hear she comes!
Watch out boys
She'll chew you up
She's dangerouuuuuus (dangerous)
Dangerouuuuuus (dangerous)
I love the scandaaaaaal

[verse i.]
[kaine]
She fire, she fine
She heals, she mine
Black barbie
I'm ken
She got hundred men and ?boosting?
I ain't really trying to let you in
But you can spend your benjamins
Make no mistake in fact it she your friend
Pisses all about differences!

[d-roc]
Wait! she like to play games
And she don't care who she play wit'
She do what she do
And she gon' get what she gon' get
She hit the strip club
And she gon' make her money quick
Shakin ass on the pole
And best believe the mamma thick (?)

Verse iii.]
[d-roc]
Get crunk lil momma
Let me see your move
Dirty dancing all in the nude
Get crunk and shit

So i spendin the money to see it
I love them girls that belly dance
Drop it down low

Remind me of a coke cola bottle.
