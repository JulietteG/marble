Night is falling
I think of you
I'm walking home
I think of you
And as he calls me, yes I do
I think of you 
How you doing?
I think of you
And I smile, I can't hide
I think of you

I don't know where your days are spent
Your lovers and you friends
But I know for sure
Of who you have been thinking

Far beyond the city's lights
Are two who dream a life
Forgive them if they never find their freedom
Their freedom

It's so late
I think of you
He walks me home
I think of you
I'm so sorry, I'm so tired
I think of you
And in the shadows
I think of you
I close my eyes
I think of you
Now I'm falling
I think of you

I think of you
As he calls my name, yes I do
I think of you
I think of you
I think of you
I think of you
I think of you

And in feeling
I think of you
And in breathing
I think of you
And in seeing
I think of you
And in living
I think of you---Lyrics submitted by Nino.
