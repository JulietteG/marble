[Intro]

When I come back from a mighty quest
I have no need for sleep or rest
I head to a tavern for a drink
And I get so drunk I cannot think
A wench by my side and a jug of mead
These are the things that I most need
So I sit back and sing this song
And drink and party all night long

(Hey hey) I want more wenches
(Hey hey) More wenches and mead
(Hey hey) I want more wenches
Lots of wenches is what I need  (x2)

[Solo]

When I come back from a mighty quest
I have no need for sleep or rest
I head to a tavern for a drink
And I get so drunk I cannot think
A wench by my side and a jug of mead
These are the things that I most need
So I sit back and sing this song
And drink and party all night long

(Hey hey) I want more wenches
(Hey hey) More wenches and mead
(Hey hey) I want more wenches
Lots of wenches is what I need  (x2)

[Solo]

(Hey hey) I want more wenches
(Hey hey) More wenches and mead
(Hey hey) I want more wenches
Lots of wenches is what I need  (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Tom Gagne.
