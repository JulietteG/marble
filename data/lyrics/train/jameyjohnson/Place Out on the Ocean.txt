Hanging with 2 bit ladies 
soaking up the Florida sun 
riding in a new Mercedes
wondering if I ever did anything to have as much fun
I hope I'm sane by the time I'm done 

Cause It's a different horizon 
It's a paradise I find that set's me loose
Ain't the truth
It's a place out on the ocean
It's a mansion with a view, but all I can think about is you  

I've been riding down a 2 lane highway 
for pretty much all of my life
trying to do things my way
wondering if I'll ever get anywhere, but where i came from 
I hope I'm sane by the time I'm done 

Cause It's a different horizon 
It's a paradise I find that set's me loose
Ain't the truth
It's a place out on the ocean
It's a mansion with a view, but all I can think about is you---Lyrics submitted by allen.
