I still remember chasing dreams
Everything I hope to be
It was always calling me away

I listen to the radio
Driving down a dusty road
Let the music go flow me
And I

I'm moving off to Nashville
Just to find that I still
Be living with the Alabama Pines

Oh, I like bringing in the New Year's Eve
Sitting on a front porch swing
Washing down the black eyed peas with beer

Back when playing all our favorite songs
And chasing girls and leaving home
Was all we ever want
Now it's clear
That I

I still remember dreaming dreams
Everything I hope to be
It was always calling me away---
