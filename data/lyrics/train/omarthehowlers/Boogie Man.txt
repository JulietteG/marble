Boogie Man  			Omar

On in Mississippi , 		dont know when 
Delta rock is cradle,	 	the blues within
Daddy plays the guitar 	told him rock the blues 
The boy left from memphis	 to pay some news
Something in the boy		 had to get out

You cant stop the boogie man  3x
Nothing is gonna stop the boogie man

Up in Detroit,  			Hasting street
Everybody dance		when the heard that beat
Boogie chilling 			made history
So it begins 			his legacy

Didnt need a mouth		made his own way

You cant stop the boogie man  3x
Nothing is gonna stop the boogie man
You cant stop the boogie man  3x
Nothing is gonna stop the boogie man

Heard the news			the other day
The boogie man			past the way
Changed the world		with his soul
He left the chare		called rock and roll
He said when im gone	i wont be gone
You cant stop the boogie man  3x
Nothing is gonna stop the boogie man

Boogie woogie al night long
Boogie woogie
He said when im gone i wont be gone 
Cause i will boogie---Lyrics submitted by freek.
