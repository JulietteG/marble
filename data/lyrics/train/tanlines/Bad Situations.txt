Do not reply, wait a day, ask why?
What the bad situations you're in have in common
Do not reply, until you know why
What the bad situations you're in have in common

You know what we have in common
You know what we have, know coming
We both have it bad

Oh, wooh, oh hoo
Oh, wooh, oh hoo
Oh, wooh, oh hoo

It's not your fault
You've never been here before
I know you're not
What you thought you were

But you know what we have in common
You know what we have, know coming
We both have it bad

We share the length of a thread
And I, far in the distance in here, I can see it in
And I, far in the distance in here, I can see it in

Yeah we both have it bad---
