All this time you waited
I waited too
To make her smooth

My heart beats slow
But I never get lonely
And you're on your own
Feeling empty without me

I won't know
What it would feel like
To be lost, alone
To be lost, alone

All this time we wasted
And for one, we got nothing to lose
All this time we wasted
What was it to prove?
I know it's true

My heart beats slow
But I never could get lonely
Cause I got somebody to always forever
Got somebody who always forever

All this time we waited
And what they say is true
You can't have it all
And all this time we waited
It was just to prove that we can't have it all---
