HO HO HO!

(Chorus)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Ladies and Gentlemen
I give you the Jingle Base

Merry Christmas

(Verse 1)
Dashing through the snow
On a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

(Chorus)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Let me hear you say
HO HO HO

Oh what fun it is to sing a sleighing song tonight

(Verse 2)
Dashing through the snow
On a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Everybody Sing

(Chorus)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Let me hear you say
HO HO HO

Merry Christmas!---Lyrics submitted by Robert.
