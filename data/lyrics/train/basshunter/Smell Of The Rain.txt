Have you ever felt the smell of the rain
that never touched the ground

Have you ever felt the smell of the rain
that never touched the ground

Have you ever felt the smell of the rain
that never touched the ground

Have you ever felt the smell of the rain
that never touched the ground---Lyrics submitted by Brian Hicks.
