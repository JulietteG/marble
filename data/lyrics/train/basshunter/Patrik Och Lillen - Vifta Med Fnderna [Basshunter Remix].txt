Again, we have flowet in your hands
Mister P and Lillen know all of the bartenderna
All the girls shejkar gutten tonight
Ordering a beer to my friend and one to myself
I'm too nice, so I invite the entire Club
Shit what churlish, I bid on the lot,
I am the guy who has zero track of price
Make that evening will be singing the trosorna afterglow
As hell that I shout, VIP cards and VIP room
(Can I keep up with you?) Fuck you, don't forget!
The queues are long, but hey, we are drifting past the
All look wrong, but hey, it's just we
Jump up, jump down. Live life in a restaurant
Jump down, jump up. Live life some died.
If you smlog, can you wait until we come up
Patrik and Lillen do what no one else can
So, yeah ...


Patrik and Lillen do what no one else can (x 3)
(So, so, so, so!)


Chorus:
Shake on the buttocks and WAGs on the hands.
For girls in the Club and the guys in the alleys
So when you see us, I would that ye buzzing
JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!


Shake on the buttocks and WAGs on the hands.
For girls in the Club and the guys in the alleys
So when you see us, I would that ye buzzing
JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!


(BassHunter! Yeah!)


Shake on the buttocks and WAGs on the hands.
For girls in the Club and the guys in the alleys
So when you see us, I would that ye buzzing
JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!


Chorus:
Shake on the buttocks and WAGs on the hands.
For girls in the Club and the guys in the alleys
So when you see us, I would that ye buzzing
JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!


Shake on the buttocks and WAGs on the hands.
For girls in the Club and the guys in the alleys
So when you see us, I would that ye buzzing
JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!


(Oh, Oh, OH)


Give me a bottle of spirits and four or five RedBull
I drink fat quickly, and tonight I am full
Fall down so all over the world, yes it spins and swings
We are drifting fat quickly before the close-out
Home to bed, we want to get all the girls
But they are playing so difficult for they know I'm a player
I invite gjejer as Moett and Champagne
But it doesn't matter because when I wake up I am broke.
As Lillen fixes taxi, because I don't go plastic pallets
But the truth is that I'm too drunk to stand
The clock is two, so long will we fix
Give us our gussar, and then drink a little spirit
It doesn't matter what spirits who we choose
Just make that all brides just sucks and swallows
Dance, jump, or just talk shit
But not tease to and fro, for we are the party's elite.


(So, so, so, so!)
Patrik and Lillen do what no one else can (x 4)
Patrik and Lillen do what no one else can (breakdown)
Patrik and Lillen do what no one else can!
(So, so, so, so!)


Chorus:
Shake on the buttocks and WAGs on the hands.
For girls in the Club and the guys in the alleys
So when you see us, I would that ye buzzing
JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!


Shake on the buttocks and WAGs on the hands.
For girls in the Club and the guys in the alleys
So when you see us, I would that ye buzzing
JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!


(BassHunter! Yeah!)


Shake on the buttocks and WAGs on the hands.
For girls in the Club and the guys in the alleys
So when you see us, I would that ye buzzing
JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!


Shake on the buttocks and WAGs on the hands.
For girls in the Club and the guys in the alleys
So when you see us, I would that ye buzzing
JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!
