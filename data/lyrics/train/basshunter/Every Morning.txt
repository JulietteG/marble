There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be
So beautiful.
Every morning she makes me a cup of coffee
with a smile on her face
Im a man in love
and shes glorious

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be so beautiful.
Every morning I wake up and I think of you
with a smile on my face
Im a man in love
And shes glorious

Oh baby I want you to stay in my life
Never say goodbye even if you cry
Im still by your side
Oh baby I want you to stay in my life
Never say goodbye even if you cry
Im still by your side

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be ..
So beautiful.
Every morning she makes me a cup of coffee
with a smile on her face
Im a man in love
And she glorious

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be so beautiful.
Every morning I wake up and I think of you
with a smile on my face
Im a man in love
And shes glorious

Every morning I wake up and I think of you
with a smile on my face
Im a man in love .. and shes glorious

Every morning!---Lyrics submitted by Ricky.
