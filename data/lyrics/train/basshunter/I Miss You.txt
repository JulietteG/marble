i don't wanna feel
the way that i do
i just want to be
right here with you
i don't wanna see
see us apart
i just want to tell u straight from my heart

hey

i can't sleep
i just can't breath
when your shadow is all over me
don't wanna be a fool in your eyes
and all we have was built of lies

i don't wanna to feel
the way that i do
i just wanna be
right here with you
i don't want to see
see us apart
i just want to tell u straight from my heart

i don't want to feel 
the way that i do
i just want to be
right here with you
i don't want to see
see us apart
i just want to tell u straight from my heart

i miss you
"aaaa.."
"aaaa.." i miss you

what would it take, for you to see
to make you understand that i will always believe
you and i, can make it through
you still know i can't get over you

i don't want to feel
the way that i do
i just want to be 
right her with you
i don't want to see
see us apart
i just want to tell you straight from my heart

i don't want to feel 
the way that i do
i just want to be
right here with you
i don't want to see 
see us apart
i just want to tell you straight from my heart

i don't want to feel
the way that i do
i just want to be 
right her with you
i don't want to see
see us apart
i just want to tell you straight from my heart

Cos' when out love, fades away
listen to me hear what i say

i don't want to feel
the way that i do
i just want to be
right here with you
i don't want to see
see us apart
i just want to tell you straight from my heart

i don't want to feel
the way that i do
i just want to be
right here with you
i don't want to see
see us apart
i just want to tell you straight from my heart

"aaaa.." i miss you

i don't want to feel, i don't want to feel the way that i do---Lyrics submitted by Billie.
