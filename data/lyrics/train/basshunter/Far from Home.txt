la na na na na na na na na na na
la na na na na na na na na na na

ten thousand meters high...
life's not complicated,
I guess I'm a lucky... guy
but still I find no reason
why I feel so empty inside
I guess I'm far away from home tonight... tonight

(Chorus)
All the places where I have been
Are the rest of this world to be seen
But I feel that I'm far from home
I don't want to be here on my own
(repeat)
....far from home......

ten thousand meters high...
life's not complicated,
I guess I'm a lucky... guy
but still I find no reason
why I feel so empty inside
I guess I'm far away from home tonight
why I feel so empty inside
I guess I'm far away from home tonight... tonight

(Chorus)
All the places where I have been
Are the rest of this world to be seen
But I feel that I'm far from home
I don't want to be here on my own
 FAR FROM HOME!!!!  (3,2,1... race)

I guess I'm far away from home tonight... tonight---Lyrics submitted by JJ.
