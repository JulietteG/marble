I know a bot
Her name is Anna, Anna is her name
She can ban you, ban you so hard
She cleans up our channel
I want to tell you that I know a bot

I know a bot 
Her name is Anna, Anna is her name
She can ban you, ban you so hard
She cleans up our channel
I want to tell you that I know a bot
She watches everyone in our channel
And sees that there is no trouble in here
And It can noway be taken over
And remember, I know a bot.
A bot that nobody can hit
And She can kick when she wants.
And She Kicks all of the Spammers
Ya, nobody can hit our bot.

Ready for Takeoff!!!!

Are You Ready?
(Long Dj Solo)

A day has come, I couldn't believe it
The channel was acting strange
I could never have thought to be so wrong
But Anna said to me "I'm not a bot"
I am really a nice girl
You have been strange for me
I have nothing to tell
In my eyes you are still a bot
Her name is Anna, Anna is her name
She can ban you, ban you so hard
She cleans up our channel
I want to tell you that I know a bot
She watches everyone in our channel
And sees that there is no trouble in here
And It can noway be taken over
And remember, I know a bot.
A bot that nobody can hit
And She can kick when she wants.
And She Kicks all of the Spammers
Ya, nobody can hit our bot.---Lyrics submitted by JSpencerK.
