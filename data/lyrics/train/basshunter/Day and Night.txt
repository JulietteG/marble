I Don't Know 
How I Could Live Without You
But You Changed 
Everything That I Knew

As Time Went On
All The Bad Feelings Were Gone
They Say When Your In Love
You Know

[Chorus]

Every Day, Every Night
Your In My Mind, I Cant Deny
I Close My Eyes, To Think Of You My Love
You Make Me Feel Alive [X2]

I Don't Know 
How I Could Live Without You
But You Changed 
Everything That I Knew

As Time Went On
All The Bad Feelings Were Gone
They Say When Your In Love
You Know

[Chorus X2]---Lyrics submitted by Connor.
