Now your gone, I realise my love for you was stronge,

And I miss you here, Now your gone,

I keep waiting here by the Phone, With your pictures hanging on the wall,

Now your gone, I realise my love for you was stronge,

And I miss you here, Now your gone,

I keep waiting here by the Phone, With your pictures hanging on the wall,

Is this the way It's ment to be, Only dreaming that your missing me, Im waiting here at home,

Ill be crazy now your gone, Theres an empty place in my heart,

Without my Yana It will break apart, It wont Heel If it fades away, I will think about you every day,

(Medium voice: Are you readyyy)

(High voice: Ready for takeoff)

Now your gone, I realise my love for you was stronge,

And I miss you here, Now your gone,

I keep waiting here by the Phone, With your pictures hanging on the wall,

Is this the way it's meant to be, Only dreaming that your missing me,

I'm waiting here at home, Ill be crazy now your gone,

Now your gone, I realise my love for you was stronge,

And I miss you here, Now your gone,

I keep waiting here by the Phone, With your pictures hanging on the wall,

Is this the way it's meant to be, Only dreaming that your missing me,

I'm waiting here at home, Ill be crazy now your gone,

Theres an empty place in my heart,

Without my Yana It will break apart, It wont Heel If it fades away, I will think about you every day.---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
