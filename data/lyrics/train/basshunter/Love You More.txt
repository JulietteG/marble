You can make the sea turn purple
You can make the sea turn turtle
But you know you can never make me love you more
You can turn wine into water
Turn sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

Everybody in the house come on

Goooo!

You can make the sea turn purple
You can make the sea turn turtle
But you know you can never make me love you more
You can turn wine into water
Turn sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more

Let the stars fall down, let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make me love you more
Let the redwoods die, let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make me love you more---Lyrics submitted by Lydia.
