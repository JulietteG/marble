Stop a while and say whats on your mind.
And let your thoughts just dripple down upon the dripping shifting sands.
Let the flower blossom in the sun, 
dont stop it once it has begun
Except, and try to understand
Come and tell me what you really think
Sit down and have a little drink 
I will not laugh at what you say today

Never mind the raven on the tree
He does not look at you or me
 his thoughts are much too far away
Maybe there are things youd like to know
And places you would like to go 
Perhaps confusion holds you down

Please dont think that I want to impress
Im as confused as all the rest
 Except for one thing that I feel, I feel
In this paperworld of here and now
I feel I have to tell you how
You are something slightly more than real
There is nothing more you need to know
I have told you what I want
So you can come with me, or you can stay
You can choose the darkness or the light
Its just a question of a fight between the scarlet and the grey, Please say
Stop a while and say whats on your mind.---Lyrics submitted by Diana Godess.
