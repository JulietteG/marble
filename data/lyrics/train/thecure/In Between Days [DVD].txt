Yesterday i got so old
I felt like i could die

yesterday i got so old
I made me want to cry

Go on go on
Just walk away

Go on go on
your choice is made

Go on go on and disappear
Go on go on away for here

And i know i was wrong when
I said it was true

That it could be me and be her
In between without you
without you

Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child 
Yesterday away from you 
It froze me deep inside

Come back come back
Don`t walk away

Come back come back
Come back today

Come back come back 
Why can`t you see?
Come back come back 
Come back to me

And i know i was wrong 
when i said it was true

That It could be we and be her in between without you 3x---Lyrics submitted by thelma.
