please wake up
it's so dark and cold
please wake up
i feel so alone
and i feel so scared
that you're going away
and i feel so scared...

all i want is summer
stories from before
just like the day you tried to hide
behind the churchyard wall
and fell asleep before i came...

i found you
in a chain of flowers
sleeping like a marble girl
sleeping in another world...

i'll never tell you
of all the different ways
you make me so afraid...---Lyrics submitted by Uma.
