I like to swing
I like to swing
I like to swing way up high

I like to swing
I like to swing 
I like to swing in the sky

I like to swing
I like to swing 
Up in the sky so blue

I like to swing
I like to swing
You push me, Ill push you

I like to swing
I like to swing 
See everything that I see

I like to swing
I like to swing 
Im a bird, Im a cloud, Im a bee!

I like to swing
I like to swing 
Im a leaf falling down

I like to swing
I like to swing 
Swing red, swing yellow, swing brown

I like to swing
I like to swing
I like to swing way up high

I like to swing
I like to swing 
I like to swing in the sky---Lyrics submitted by Melanie Weinraub.
