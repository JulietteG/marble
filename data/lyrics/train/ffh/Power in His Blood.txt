I lie awake hoping that I will hear
Your voice inside my ear
Telling me you're here
But I know I'll find my precious piece of mind
When you speak to me just in time
Let me know you still care

There's power in His blood
Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand
There's joy in His spirit
There's power in His blood
Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand
There's joy in His spirit
Sufficient and full there's power in His blood
His love is all we need
There's joy in the spirit of the Lord

You are the one who had made me complete
Now I'm kneeling at your feet
Knowing you can lead me home
I'll stand through it all
Waiting on your call
Knowing that you'll hear my every prayer

Chorus

I know there's strength in His everlasting Word And I know I'll find all the love I need in His arms
