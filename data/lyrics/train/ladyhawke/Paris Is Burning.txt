All of the boy and the girl here, in Paris.
Sing to the night without sight, but with madness.
I cant keep up, Im a wreck, but I want it.
Tell me the truth, is it love or just Paris?

All of the boys and the girls her, in Paris.
Sing to the night without sight, but with madness.
I cant keep up, Im a wreck, but i want it.
Tell me the truth, is it love or just Paris?

My heart is yearning, but Paris is burming.
Paris is burning all night long
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming
Paris is screaming all night long.

My heart is yearning, but Paris isburning.
Paris is burning all night long
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming
Paris is screaming all night long.

Kids in th the secret drinking wine, on thesidewalk. 
Saving the plans that we made,till its night time 
Give me your glass, its your last, youre too wasted.
Get me one too , cause Im due any tasting

Kids in  the street drinking wine, on the sidewalk.
Saving the plans that we made, till its night time.
Give me your glass, it you r last, youre wasted.
Get me one too, cause Im due any tasting.

My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning.
Paris is burning all night long.
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming.
Paris is screaming all night long.

My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning.
Paris is burning all night long.
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming.
Paris is screaming all night long.

Ive lost my way, its hard to find it trought.
I see the night, but im lost outside pf you.
Ive lost my way, its hard to find it trough.
I see the night, but im lost outside of you.

My heart is yearning but,  Paris is burning 
Paris is burning all night long.
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming.
Paris is screaming all night long.

My heart is yearning, but Paris is burning.
Paris is burning all night  long.
My heart is dreaming, but Paris is screaming.
Paris is screaming all night long.

Ive lost my way, its hard to find  it trought.
I see the night, but im lost outside of you.
Ive lost my way, its hard to find it trought.
I see the night, but im, lost outside of you.

Ive lost my way, its hard to find it trought.
I see the night, but im lost outside of you.
Ive lost my way, its hard to find if trought.
I see the night, but im lost outside of you.---Lyrics submitted by frida.
