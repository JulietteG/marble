You came to my show
and I saw you in the crowd
I didn't know your name
I didn't know your name

I asked all my friends
who you were and your story
They told me the same
They told me the same

I've left my heart to you
but its not fair
'cause your taking me for granted, baby
I've made a start with you
but it's not fair
'cause your over the Atlantic, baby

One journey for you
but its worth it
one life here with me
and it's magic

One journey for you
but its worth it
one life here with me
and it's magic

You stayed in my head
where I saw you all the time
I didn't think you'd care
I didn't think you'd care

I found you all day 
with a mouth full of attitude
and you stole me away
You stole me away

I've left my heart for you
but its not fair
'cause your taking me for granted, baby
I made a start with you
but it's not fair
'cause your over the Atlantic, baby

one journey for you
but its worth it
one life here with me
and it's magic

one journey for you
but its worth it
one life here with me
and it's magic

one journey for you
but its worth it
one life here with me
and it's magic

one journey for you
but its worth it
one life here with me
and it's magic---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
