Late night, waiting by the phone 
Tonight waiting for an answer 
Heartbeat drumming double time 
I need one more chance to be near you 

Still hanging on (for what) 
Cant operate (fired up) 
I wont eat and I won't sleep for you yeah 
No rest till I (get through) 
Cause Im holding out (for you) 
Am I the only one whos insane 

Hey youre playing with my delirium 
And the longer I wait the harder Im gonna fall 
Stop playing with my delirium 
Cause Im outta my head and outta my self control 

Still here in this quiet room 
Deep in delusion sending me over 
Outside watch the world go by 
Inside time stands still as I wonder 

Still hanging on (for what) 
Cant operate (fired up) 
I wont eat and I won't sleep for you yeah 
No rest till I (get through) 
Cause Im holding out (for you) 
Am I the only one whos insane 

Hey youre playing with my delirium 
And the longer I wait the harder Im gonna fall 
Stop playing with my delirium 
Cause Im outta my head and outta my self control 

(I wont eat and I won't sleep for you yeah) 

Hey youre playing with my delirium 
And the longer I wait the harder Im gonna fall 
Stop playing with my delirium 
Cause Im outta my head and outta my self control 
Hey youre playing with my delirium 
And the longer I wait the harder Im gonna fall 
Stop playing with my delirium 
Cause Im outta my head and outta my self control---Lyrics submitted by Charley.
