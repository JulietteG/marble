She still keeps the pictures up of who she lost
Joy is a memory that she forgot
Life wasnt fair to her
A cold room and all alone
She cries tonight, her prayers are angry words
Theyre questions why life wasnt fair to her

CHORUS
Youre healer to the broken 
Shepherd to the lost
Father to the orphan
Adopted by the cross 
Theres comfort in Your arms
Its where our healing starts
Our only hope is Jesus

Hes tired of carrying his fathers words
Telling him hes not enough, he has no worth
Hes memorized the lines
He works his life away to measure up
And all hes left with is empty love
Even he can find the love hes been denied

CHORUS

Our only hope is Jesus

Even though I walk down broken roads
I will never have to walk alone
When I cannot stand on my own feet, You will carry me

CHORUS

Our only hope is Jesus
Our only hope is Jesus
Our only hope is Jesus---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
