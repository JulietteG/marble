Hey lady let me tell you why, 
Icant live my life without you,oh baby 
everytime I see you walking by i get a thrill 
you dont notice me but in time you will,I must make you 
understand..... 

chorus:I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man) 
I wanna be your man (I do yeah,yeah) 
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man) 
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man) 

Better not pass me by,cause if you do you'll lose a good 
thing, (oh baby) Cause what I got to say is sealed with a kiss 
and a wedding ring 
(wedding ring)
My mind is blind at times 
I can't see any one but you
Those other girls don't matter no they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand..... 

[chorus: (2x)]

Words can never say what I feel, (it's too intense) 
oh oh oh oh. I tried I tried I tried I tried to tell you 
how I feel,but I get mixed up (soo mixed up) 
my mind is blind at times I cant see anyone but you,those other 
girls dont matter no they cant spoil my view,I must make you 
understand.....
