School Gyrls, Aaron Fresh

(Chorus)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way

Verse 1

Dashing through the snow
in one horse open-sleigh
o'er laughing all the way

Bells on Bob- tails ring
making spirits rise
Oh what fun it is
ride and sing a sleighing song tonite

(Chorus)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way

Verse

(Mo' money) A day or 2 ago
I thought I'd take a ride
and see Mandy and Jacque
was seated by my side

As we danced and sing along
To all our favorite songs
And let all the music play
as we jingled all the way (Ohhhh)

(Chorus)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way

(Aaron Fresh)
Jingle Bells and the people
Aaron Fresh, me and the school gyrls
Sing, Sing, Sing

This what Christmas mean to me
Lights and the Christmas tree so bright
Christmas Carols, Silent Nite
Me and the school gyrls, we just might
jingle all the way through the night

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way

(Chorus)(3x)
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way---Lyrics submitted by shakyla.
