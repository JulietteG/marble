We Gon get it, Yeah we gon get it

I said we going to the mall. going-going to the mall
Going to the mall, going-going to the mall
I said we going to the mall, going-going to the mall
Goin Goin Goin

(Verse)
Gotta get brand new shoes and a bag
Going to the mall to step up my swag
Wait till they see these pop star sneakies (Ohhhhh)
I swear, them squares wanna be me

We spendin big cheese on pastrys
Even if they want to, them haters can't hate me (nah)
Looking so fly, gotta get my nails done
Candy paint neon, and even bubble gum

When we go shopping, it aint no stopping
School Gyrls, you know we get it popping
Do the dance, cash money credit card
Do the dance, ch-ch-charge

(Chorus 2x)
I said we going to the mall. going-going to the mall
Going to the mall, going-going to the mall
I said we going to the mall, going-going to the mall
Goin Goin Goin 

(Bridge)
Ohhhh we're going to mall and we're goin buy ev-ery-thing I want

Oh Gon Get It, Yeah we gon get it
We Gon get it, Yeah we gon get it
See it and you want it
Go ahead and charge it
Big money over here, Yeah we gonna get it all

(Chorus 2x)
I said we going to the mall. going-going to the mall
Going to the mall, going-going to the mall
I said we going to the mall, going-going to the mall
Goin Goin Goin

(Verse 2)
Spending all my dough at the sto, all my dough at the store
Need a few more dollars at the bank
Cause when I wake up, I go straight to the mall
Yeah Gimme that (gimme that), I want it all

Got my own stuff cuz I Miss Independent
Got a part-time job, but I'm full time spending
They say I need stop cold turkey 
like after Thanksiving (yeah)

Everything's on sale, oh I love retail
If you got a bargain, hit me on my email
Time to get it started, This is for my females
Do the dance cash money credit card, do the dance ch-ch-charge

(Chorus 2x)
I said we going to the mall. going-going to the mall
Going to the mall, going-going to the mall
I said we going to the mall, going-going to the mall
