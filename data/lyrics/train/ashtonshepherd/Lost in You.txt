Verse 1:
I feel a million miles away
I believe I'm lost in the way you hold me
In my eyes we're the only ones here
Absolutely no fear

Chorus:
'Cause I get lost in your eyes,lost in your touch
Lost in the way I ain't ever cared so much
And hopin' to God you feel like I do
Completely lost in you

Verse 2:
I'm a little nervous about this feelin'
But I'll leave it, no holdin' back, only believin'
I'm not sure how you feel or what you wanna do
But I can say straight from my heart all I want is you

Repeat Chorus:

'Cause I'm completely lost in you
I feel a million miles away---Lyrics submitted by Cara.
