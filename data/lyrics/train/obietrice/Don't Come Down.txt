Don't come down things will always wake up
Don't come down things will always wake up
Don't come down things will always wake up
So when you find yourself in peices

As a child i was fowl
(uh) Ma, I couldn't understand them things that came out ya mouth (daddys ain't shit)
You would cuss, fuss till your blood pressure went up, then give up and slouch on the couch and drink ya liqor (fuck you dog)
A hard headed nigga I was quick temper short attention span not attending class (no) what a dummy
I would run over you honey
You confront me and say Obie you no longer have a mommy
Don't use my phone don't even eat my food
Matter a fact, Dont speak
It was just me and you in that house with that mouse and them traps and they gat, waitin on the day when you gon pull the
trigger back
[Chorus] 

Don't come down things will always wake up (Im sorry)
Don't come down things will always wake up (I messed up)
Don't come down things will always wake up (Did wrong)
So when you find yourself in peices

You tryin to kill me boy (no)
Is that what you wanna do, kill me? You wanna kill me (kill me)
Your not feelin me the beepers not that drastic
Its the B blasted, bastard
Your lyin (your lyin)
You took plastic freezer bags with dope inside of em
She knew, damn but she hated that it was true
I done raised two boys I can do away with you
The locks changed and the nights got colder
Im slinging bolders lookin like the bolda tolka
Fuck it im the osta
Im down for mounds ride by my corner 
Like Im not gone cry (no)
Not reek the pain of watchin my youngest man (no no no)
On the corners slangin cane
Im callin the cops

[chorus x2]

Ma even though I left the house alone
I was seventeen years old on my own using these streets as my home (yea)
Theres no reason to prolong this beef (yea i love you)
Ms. Eleanor Trice I place no one above you
You the reason when I hustled I knew the stack
The reason when I opened up t mics i knew to rip (rip dat)
The ethnics you instilled on this hectic young brother
Rubbed off after all 
Now look at ya boy (Look)
When they ask about me now you aint gon just put ya head down ma
Straighten up ma you can smile now, proud
Everythings kosher with the boshterous oysta
Lets get closer
The regrets never opposed us
