Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to lent 50 cents
No phone no pool no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah but 2 hours of pushin' broom
buys a 8x12 four bed room
Im' a man of means by no means King of the road

Third boxcar midnight train
Destination banger maine
Old warn out suit and shoes
I don't pay no union dues

I smoke ol' stoagies i have found
Short but not too big around

Im a man of means by no means King of the road

I know every engineer on every train
All of their children and all of their names
Every handout in every town
And every lock that aint locked when noones around

I sing Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to lent 50 cents
No phone no pool no pets
 I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah but 2 hours of pushin' broom 
buys a 8x12 four bedroom
Im a man of means by no means
King of the road

I know every engineer on every train
All of their children and all of their names
Every handout in every town
And every lock that aint locked when no ones around

I sing trailers for sale or rent 
rooms to lent 50 cents
No phone no pool no pets
I aint got no cigarettes

Ah but 2 hours of pushin' broom
buys a 8x12 four bedroom
Im a man of means by no means
King of the road

Trailers for sale or rent 
Rooms to lent 50 cents
No phone no pool no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

2 hours of pushin broom 
buys a 8x12 four bedroom
Im a man of means by no means
King of the road

King of the road
King of the road---Lyrics submitted by Cody Smith.
