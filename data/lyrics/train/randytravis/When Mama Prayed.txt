For you, I am praying
For you, I am praying
For you, I am praying
I am praying for you

Daddy never went to church on Sunday
He said, that's one thing, I'll never do
But Mama never gave up, she said, one day
He'll be sitting here beside me and you

I can still hear Mama softly talking
Her tears falling on her folded hands
So that Easter Sunday, Daddy walked in
That's when I began to understand

When Mama prayed,
Good things happened
When Mama prayed,
Life would change
Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small
Would crumble all away
When Mama prayed

Seventeen and wild, I hit the bottom
Doing anything I dang well pleased
Burning down Life's highway at full throttle
While Mama burned a candle, on her knees

Then one night, I came home, half-sober
I saw Mama kneeling in the den
As I listened, she and Jesus talked it over
And I knew my restless days were 'bout to end

'Cause when Mama prayed,
Good things happened
When Mama prayed,
Life would change
Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small
Would crumble all away
When Mama prayed

It isn't like every one of them got answered
But the times they weren't, almost seemed fair
You almost felt sorry for the devil
'Cause Heaven knows he didn't have a prayer
When Mama prayed

Not much more than five foot tall
But mountains big and small
Would crumble all away
When Mama prayed

Crumble all away
When Mama prayed---Lyrics submitted by Alyssa Tomlin.
