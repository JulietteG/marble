When I think of all the bitter times I've had
Oh god it doesn't make me sad
Oh no it doesn't bother me
Strenghth and honour is all I see

Oh Give thanks unto the Almighty god
he showed me what I had
he said
Stand firm and keep the faith
Oh your reward should be great
so now I see the day

CORO:

When I'm steppin' out of Babylon, in New Jerusulem in Mount Zion
now I'm steppin' out of Babylon, in New Jerusulem in Mount Zion
Steppin out of Babylon one by one, steppin in Mount Zion (x2)
Steppin, steppin, steppin out a Babylon (x2)

I've got no alternative in a Babylon
But I know yes, I know there's a Mount Zion
But oh some day his children will find the way
so get up, get up and don't let the devil lead you astray

CORO:

Steppin' out a Babylon, in New Jerusulem, in Mount Zion (x2)
Steppin' out a Babylon one by one, steppin in Mount Zion (x2)
Steppin, steppin, steppin out a Babylon x2

Oh Give thanks unto the Almighty god
he showed me what I had 
he said
Stand firm and keep the faith
Oh your reward should be great
so now I see the day

CORO:

When I'm steppin' out a Babylon, in New Jerusulem in Mount Zion
I'm steppin' out a Babylon, in New Jerusulem in Mount Zion

Steppin out of Babylon one by one, oh what a glorious day I see steppin in Mount Zion (Oh what a beautiful day I see
Steppin out of Babylon one by one, when I'm steppin in the gates of the new Jerusulem oh....
Steppin in Mount Zion sing it sing it sing sing a Zion
Steppin, steppin, steppin out a Babylon (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Miguel Vega.
