Am I really here in your arms
Its like I dreamed it would be
I feel like a frozen in time
You're the only one I can see.

CORO:
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you
Now you're here
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you
All my Life

And I never really knew how to love
I just hoped somehow I'd see
Asked for a little help from above
Send that angel down to me

CHORUS:
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you
And now you're here
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you
All my Life

I never thought that I could feel a love so tender
I never thought I could let those feelings show

But now my heart is on my sleeve
and this love will never leave
I know
I know

CORO
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you
Now you're here
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you
All my Life
All my Life

Hey, I've looked All my Life for you
Now you're here
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you
All my Life---Lyrics submitted by Miguel Vega.
