When your in love its a lovely life 
When someone asks you to be his wife 
It is so good for you to settle down 
It does pay for you to rob the town 

When you find someone who is true to you
Someone wholl do what you want to do 
I said its good for you to settle down 
It doesn't pay for you to rob the town 

It is so good for you to settle down 
It does pay for you to rob the town

When your in love its a lovely life 
When someone asks you to be his wife 
It is so good for you to settle down 
It doesn't  pay for you to rob the town

I said its good for you to settle down 
It doesn't pay for you to rob the town---Lyrics submitted by VELLI.
