The sky grows bigger every day.
And the other week I hopped on a train;
Cutting through state lines.
To come to you as the crow flies-
out there in there offing everything was melon and orange.

Did you know, my sweet
That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?

And I just want you to know
that every pool of water reminds me of you.
Is that all right?
I hope you think it's cool, yeah
'Cause sometimes a train can't go as fast as I want it to.

Did you know, my sweet
That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?
I rolled over and over
Trying to touch your knees, yeah underneath the sheets
Trying to touch your knees.

Everything seemed a little easier when we weren't one hundred miles apart.
The person across from me sitting in her train seat, reminded me of you.
And I looked out past her cheeks through the glass-light conduit.
But the sun had sunk- disappeared into New Jersey
Oh, why don't they have phones on these things? 

What can I do?
I'm stuck thinking about you.

Did you know, my sweet
That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?
I rolled over and over.
Trying to touch your knees, yeah underneath the sheets.
Trying to touch your knees.---Lyrics submitted by Jamie.
