I said excuse me little mama if I may
Take this thought and send it your way
And if you dont like that, then send it right back,
But I just gotta say
I wanna be on you (on you)
I wanna be on you (on you)
And if you dont like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say

Flo Rida

Come get get get it, the business, I hi hit it, whose is it
The Benz with the windows tinted, oh I get dirty south

Let no not ever with this lil mama off schedule
Got me achy, call me papi, hottest I be fly as feathers

Deserve an encore, the definition of a shone

Hey, Im feeling you girl, wanna get close to you, no doubt
My sister swagger should tell it more
than anything can vouch
Little mama you are whats inside ghetto
Fine Ill make you proud
So stuntalicious, I love it, lets at least work something out
Miss thing, million dollar game, coke bottle frame
Make my wall of fame let me know your name
I control the rain I could make it better, matter of fact
I make it weather, stormy weather with this cheddar
All because you hot as ever
if you may lady, let me play baby, make my way baby,
You wont like it, send it back and its okay baby
Yous a keeper, touch of diva, give me a fever
If I could freak ya, give me the word and Ill be along
