(Flo Rida) 
Its the time, its the right time 
Its the time, yo its the perfect time 
Yo, its the time, its the right time 
Its the time, baby baby baby 
I'm a single man 
Now lets go out and hit the town and start the minglin 
I'll bag the baddest girl around and get her gigglin 
I'll take her out onto the floor and get her wigglin 

Cuz I aint got no girlfriend, got no obligation 
Baby, I'm a single man...thats my situation 
Let me put your number in my iPhone, baby 
And when I call ya later, maybe I can see ya, lady 

(Akon) 
I'm finally free and I'ma get right tonight 
I'm finally free and I'ma get right tonight 
I'm so available, I'm so available 
So come and get me 

(Flo Rida) 
If you a single girl 
Up in the club lookin for love then come and bring it, girl 
This is the song, now turn it up and come and sing it, girl 
And if your man blow up your phone, turn off your ringer, girl 
Turn off your ringer 

Cuz I aint got no girlfriend, you aint got one either 
If you got a girlfriend, baby wont you bring her 
If you got a ex, leave your ex at home 
And if he instant message, throw away your cell phone 

(Akon) 
I'm finally free and I'ma get right tonight 
I'm finally free and I'ma get right tonight 
I'm so available, I'm so available 
So come and get me---Lyrics submitted by Brad.
