I Cant Believe It
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It aint a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that babu I am bam, baram bam baram
babu I am bam, baram bam baram

Uh, I think I found one cause I got that fever of...
Gotta self around one, ass like Serena, thats okay
cause I love my stereotypes, my girls in tools
That maximum exposure... know what I wanna do,
Telling all the girls, all around the world, my last name must be Robin
cause Im basking in these asses, all thirty flavours keep calling,
My my my my vanilla Cinderella love it when I tell her drop it,
A butt of... but I love my chocolate.

Chorus:
I Cant Believe It
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It aint a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that babu I am bam, baram bam baram
babu I am bam, baram bam baram

Pitbull:
She got that butt donk-donkie- donkie
They so fat, they so chunky,
Call me Michael Jackson, hi hi
cause I love to play with monkies,
This the Miami thing, thats right
We down for anything thats right,
Youtube everything, thats right
Flow right to Pitbull anything,
Im off the chain and lane lane, lane lane
Ustedes saben quien es quien
Mira salinga con toda esa...
Como tu sabes estoy loco.
Pero que bueno que era poco,
Mami mueve los coco,
I dont care where youre from
As long as you got that...

[Chorus:]
Now turn left, turn right
Turn around you could tell what I like
She love good, she so bad
She kick it up, drop it down, look back.

Babu I am bam, baram bam baram
babu I am bam, baram bam baram
babu I am bam, baram bam baram
babu I am bam, baram bam baram

(2x)
I Cant Believe It

I wanna see it, baram bam baram.
I Cant Believe It
Why girl got some ass
I wanna see it, baram bam baram---
