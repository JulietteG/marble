Heavy metal for them boys 
Slanging pedals for the cash 
Got an appetite for destruksion 
You can call me Axl 
Ask me bout what a nigga done done 
Ask me bout what a nigga do well 
Ask me were the bricks come from 
That's what a snitch 
Nigga do they tell 
I don't want nothing to 
Do with that deal 
If it's selected I'm 
Bringing them shells 
Only position for me is a playa 
That's right playa 
Better get it right playa 
I have to be in emergency 
Lucky for you if I'm blowing my trees 
Come on my nerve 
No regular me

With me on her knees 
I'm ready if there's a problem 
She sexy flo rida holla 
Don't test me get that bro harda 
Get messy just like a mobster 
My brawls deserve lobsters 
You clowns deserve choppas 
You serve like jimmy hoppa
