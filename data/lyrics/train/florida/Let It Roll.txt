Love is nice when its understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me tripping why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll

Its like Woodstockbrand new billion
And bark to the music, sucker than a psychic
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrick
Walk to a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my lambo, strikes and a visit
To meeting in the rain, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know
When the party gonna stop, let the good times roll
Come on lets go, you gotta 
Get the party on the roll, aint nothing like the feeling
When youre winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one love
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world aint ready cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like to know, just what to do
When the good times roll

Love is nice when its understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me tripping why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll

Come on baby, let the good times roll

Roll is on, everybody getting taste of the
Feeling while  when youre bad to the bone
Gotta be the hottest when you shine like chrome
Gotta find that tone, has a mind of its own
Love while Im sposed to look around and its gone
Love while Im sposed to up hold it down for this crown
Just like her, Im already gone,
Let the good times go

All I wanna lock, lock, up in this drop top
Pull up in the Chevy so classy and hot, hot, hot
Pockets full and heavy got you screaming what you got got
What you tryna say, I know I already rock, rock
Gotta let go, pedal to the floor
So incredible, so much better with the flow
Ready for the show, 
Do it like a pro, let the good times roll, roll, roll, roll

And lets go all night, all night
Wake up the club and lets go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast for the good times
Where they last forever, were youngs, yeah the good times
Raise your glass, lets all have some fun

Love is nice when its understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me tripping why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll.
