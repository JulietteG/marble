They never realize that they come tell we late,
Now time done and the worlds on fire.
It don't matter what you may hear,
You can trust the thief but not a liar.
Ten seconds and counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
Keep dropping your bombs and having your fun,
Proceed with caution.

WE KNOW, that we falling apart,
WE KNOW, and we're stumbling in the dark,
WE KNOW, and we have been from the start.
Broke up the place dem, mash up the place done,
YOU'VE TAKEN,
more than you can use.
Now do you hear me?
NOTHING'S LEFT,
for us to do.

Are you staying the night? (x3)

Calling the world and all of them fools,
who think say it's cool and everything's fine.
Load up your guns and spend all your funds,
Run red lights.
Ten seconds and counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
Keep dropping your bombs and having your fun,
Proceed with caution.

WE KNOW, that we falling apart,
WE KNOW, and we're stumbling in the dark,
WE KNOW, and we have been from the start.
Broke up the place dem, mash up the place done,
YOU'VE TAKEN,
more than you can use.
Now do you hear me?
NOTHING'S LEFT,
for us to do.

We know that we can make it OH!
We know that we can make it!
YOU'VE TAKEN,
more than you can use.
Now do you hear me?
NOTHING'S LEFT,
for us to do.

We've taken more than we can. (x4)

PROCEED WITH CAUTION! (x4)---Lyrics submitted by The Doctor.
