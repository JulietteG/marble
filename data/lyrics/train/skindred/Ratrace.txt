Too much of us caught inna rat trap we ah fe bust out ah dat
Too much of us caught inna rat race ah fe bust out ah dat

They're in a contest and a competition
Caught in the snare material suction
If what you've got is all you mention
Move an go way I tell you, move an go way I tell you
Pushing and pulling juggling it no stop
There's always free cheese inside a rattrap.
You better watch before the snap goes pop
Move an go way I tell you, move an go way I tell you

Don't even bother with the boasting
Just take care, coz this ya rat race ain't fair
Even the saints them are falling
So beware! You'll find no winners in there

You know its gunner get you whoa
And it will never let you go
You know who its gunner get you whoa
And it will never let you go

Rattrap we can't escape from it whoa!
And it will never let you go whoa whoa
Rattrap we can't escape from it whoa
It'll never it'll never, we inna we inna
Rattrap we can't escape from it whoa!
And it will never let you go whoa whoa
Rattrap we can't escape from it whoa
And it will never let you go, can't get out of there

Chatty people they will talk all day
Talk your business and they feel no way
Elaborate and make up the story
Move an go way I tell you, move an go way I tell you

Don't even bother with the boasting
Just take care, coz this ya rat race ain't fair
Even the saints them are falling
So beware! You'll find no winners in there

You know its gunner get you whoa
And it will never let you go
You know who its gunner get you whoa
And it will never let you go

Rattrap we can't escape from it whoa!
And it will never let you go whoa whoa
Rattrap we can't escape from it whoa
It'll never it'll never, we inna we inna
Rattrap we can't escape from it whoa!
And it will never let you go whoa whoa
Rattrap we can't escape from it whoa
And it will never let you go

It's a rat race; it's a rat race
Someone come and tell me wha de gworn with the human race?
Fury breaks the chain! Let us go.---Lyrics submitted by Elena.
