You`ve got the best of both worlds
you`re the kind of girl who can take down a man,
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you`re needy,
Humble but you`re greedy
And based on your body language,
And shoddy cursive I`ve been reading
Your style is quite selective,
Though your mind is rather reckless
Well i guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is

And what a beautiful mess this is
It`s like we`re picking up trash in dresses

Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
kind of turn themselves into knives
And don`t mind my nerve you could call it fiction
But I like being submerged
In your contradictions, dear
Cause here we are
Here we are

Although you were biased i love your advice
Your comebacks theyre quick and probably 
Have to do with your insecurities
Theres no shame in being crazy
Depending on how you take these
Words Im paraphrasing
This relationship were staging

And what a beautiful mess
This is
Its like picking up trash in dresses

Well, it kind of hurts
When the
Kind of words you say
Kind of turn
Themselves into blades
Kind and courteous
is a life Ive heard
But its nice to say
That we played in the dirt, Oh dear
Cause here we are
Here we are

Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are 
Here we are
Here we are
Were still here

What a beautiful mess this is
Its like taking a guess when the only answer is yes

And through timeless words,
And priceless pictures
Well fly like birds
Not of this earth (?)
 And tides they turn,
And hearts disfigure
But thats no concern
When were wounded together
And we
Tore our dresses,
And stained our shirts
But its nice today,
Oh  the wait was so worth it---Lyrics submitted by Karrin.
