How many times
Did I feel I was lonely
How many times
Did I feel I couldn't make it
How many times (x3)
Did I turn to you

Whenever I needed
Someone to love me
Whenever I needed
Someone to touch me
How many times (x3)
It was always you

You're my rock
Here's my heart
You place me upon a
Pedestal like I was the one

Now I know
Dreams come true
Every night I pray for you

When part of me died
He sent you to me
He knew that you be the right one for me
How many times (x3)
Did I turn to you

How many times
Did I feel I was falling
When I was lost
You heard me calling
How many times (x3)
It was always you

You're my rock
Here's my heart
You place me upon a
Pedestal like I was the one

Now I know
Dreams come true
Every night I pray for you

I love you (x3)
I really do
I love you (x3)
I really do

Now I know
Dreams come true
Every night I pray for you

Now I know
Dreams come true
Every night I pray for you---Lyrics submitted by Marcia Nicolais.
