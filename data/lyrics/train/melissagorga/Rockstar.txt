Hey hey I just want to party
(I just want to party)
 have a real good time tonight

Call up all my girls
say we're gonna break it down tonight
we came to shut it down
turn the music up loud
we're gonna stand on top the tables

let's get the party started now
everybody in the crowd shout it out

party in the club until the sun comes up
gonna do it like a Rockstar
put your drinks up
the dj's on fire and he's playing my song
gonna keep this party rocking til the lights come on

now everybody say hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
everybody say hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
now everybody say hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
everybody say hey hey, all my fans say hey hey, if you feel me say hey hey

Hey you standing over there
Why you got your hands in your pockets? Are ya scared?
Do you need attention? Maybe I can give you some

Go and kiss a stranger if you wanna have fun
we came to shut it down
turn the music up loud
we gonna stand onto of tables
let's get the party started now
everybody in the crowd shout it out

party in the club until the sun comes up
gonna do it like a Rockstar
put your drinks up
the dj's on fire and he's playing my song
gonna keep this party rocking til the sun comes up

now everybody say hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
everybody say hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
now everybody say hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
everybody say hey hey, all my fans say hey  hey, if you feel me say hey hey

(put your hands up if you want the stress to fade away
turn it up turn it up turn it up
now mr. dj
there's something bout this something makes me feel this way
now let the music play, play, play


party in the club until the sun comes up
gonna do it like a Rockstar
put your drinks up
the dj's on fire and he's playing my song
gonna keep this party rocking til the sun comes up

now everybody say hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
everybody say hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
now everybody say hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
everybody say hey hey, all my fans say hey  hey, if you feel me say hey hey---Lyrics submitted by Ally Sagner.
