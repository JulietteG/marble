How strange to feel this way
Play it cool, the fever
Everything that I have been dreaming of

So real, a woven tent appears before me
Heat lightning struck the sky, could only think of you as it was flashing by

And I don't want to be afraid, I want to take you home
Where in the morning I can see your eyes
And I don't want to be afraid, I want to take you home
Where in the morning I can see your eyes

Half-asleep, in my bedroom
Thinking of you
Everything, anything would be cool with me

And I've been told where there is love there is danger
And giving you my heart would be painless
I know nothing will last forever, I still like the thought of being together

And I don't want to be afraid, I want to take you home
Where in the morning I can see your eyes
And I don't want to be afraid, I want to take you home
Where in the morning I can see your eyes

Keep on dancing if the lights keep flashing (x10)---Lyrics submitted by AIden Michael.
