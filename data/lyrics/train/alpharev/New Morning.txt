I don't give a damn about the castle on the hill,
all the gold that we could eat, or the horse you had for sale.
No I'm getting kind of rich on the side of any soul, alive.

I don't give a damn if I'm running from the law,
when my moneys not enough, and they come and take it all.
No I'm getting kind of rich on the side of any soul, alive.

Have you heard the Mona Lisa,
Have you heard who you are.
You're a new morning
You're a new morning

Wanna be ok when I'm sitting here alone,
not just thinking of the ways that I could have done it wrong.
No I'm getting kind of rich on the side of any soul, alive.

Have you heard the Mona Lisa, 
Have you heard who you are.
You're a new morning
You're a new morning 
You're a new morning
Now you're a new morning.

Have you heard the Mona Lisa,
Have you heard who you are.
You're a new morning
You're a new morning
You're a new morning
Now you're a new morning.---Lyrics submitted by Marla.
