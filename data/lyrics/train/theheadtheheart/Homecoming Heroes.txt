So now I know
People want a story
Want an end with glory
And a wave of their flag

Well as far as I can tell
The homecoming heroes
Get put in the headlines
And back off they go

And I wont stand for anything more
Tried our hand even though we were poor
Weve put in the time
Casting our lines off shore

Yes some things I dread
I duck into alleys
I avoid the rallies
Its a choice of my own

And I wont stand for anything more
Tried our hand even though we were poor
Weve put in the time
Casting our lines off shore

And Im sorry but I find no glory in that
I just want you off my back
And theres not a word in my head floating around
You wont pick your part and put down

And I wont stand for anything more
Tried our hand even though we were poor
Weve put in the time
Casting our lines off shore
Weve put in the time
Casting our lines

And Im sorry but I find no glory in that
I just want you off my back
And theres not a word in my head floating around
You wont pick your part and put down

So get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head ---
