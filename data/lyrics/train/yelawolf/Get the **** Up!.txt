Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up
Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up

Wraaa Daddy gonna pop that trunk
Yea, batter chip some throwing dirt bare chumps
Sling shot rocks broke no money numbs
Looking up too D boys with the pretty dunks
Slick sit down you aint in the city thump
Special K make the kitties come
Get you some get mini guns
Move a rock tip those down petting on
Get your own dicks sip on give the dog a bone
Sitting' on bigger chrome get us home
Bird fight pit fight for the good zone
Looking at the world like what I do wrong
Nothing but a male mantra coming back for the pickup
I'm a gift you can't get rid of
Reclined on me homie I'm a make ya sit up
Get drunk do it stay slide so let up scream like

Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up
Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up

Wraaa
Let the beat ride like that
Yea I'm a thunderbird never coming back
Thunder in the trunk thunder in the dope sack
I serve a mot thunder in the dope raps (BOOM)
Big lacks in the tall grass sit with the tires flat
Real good price body you should buy that
Blink and you might pass my town
Hold in the wall king my crown
Oh but of all things my sound
Is picking up like a 30 mile long train
Slow climb up but it's such a long drain
So how did I become up pickup all names
What if every tale like it could bar drains
The headless horsemen won an untamed like

Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up
