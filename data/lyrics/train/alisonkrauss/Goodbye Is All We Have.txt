I'm soaring the sky, I can hear the birds
And man they don't lie
How you gonna catch me when I'm this high

I'm moving on
I got the words to a brand new song
How you gonna catch me when I'm this gone

(Chorus:)
Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got something to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have

I disconnected the phone
Told the neighbors I'll be heading on
As soon as the light hits the lawn

I'm heading north
Gonna see what this heart's really worth
I guess it's time to be on my own

(Chorus:)
Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got something to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have

I sure would love to see you tonight
Maybe try to end this fight
If I don't hear you knockin on my door
Then I'll know for sure

(Chorus:)
Gone tomorrow here today
Just in case you got something to say
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all

(Chorus:)
Gone tomorrow here today
I'll be leaving with the rest if goodbye
Is all we have---Lyrics submitted by Sunshine.
