I'd rather have Jesus
than silver and gold,
I'd rather be His
than have riches untold,
I'd rather have Jesus
than houses or lands,
I'd rather be let
by His nail-pierced hand,
Than to be the king
of a vast domain
And be held in sin's
dread sway
I'd rather have Jesus
than anything
This world affords today
I'd rather have Jesus
then men's applause,
I'd rather be faithful
to his dear cause
I'd rather have Jesus
than worldwide fame,
I'd rather be true
to His holy name
Than to be the king
of a vast domain
and be held in sin's
dread sway
I'd rather have Jesus
than anything
This world affords today
I'd rather have Jesus
than anything
This world affords today---Lyrics submitted by Elmer.
