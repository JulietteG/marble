More Than Conquerers: If you wanna find heaven with me, I will show you the way. Eternal youth, forever young, immortalize your name. My foolish heart, put nails through me. On his day I will be ready. We are the children of the age, out of control, out of place, we will demolish this religion that you have made. Nails. Through. Me. If you wanna find heaven with me, I will show you the way. Uphold my name so i can proudly claim yours. We call you God, but are you king. Strip me of my status, my everything, immortalize my name. We are the children of the age. out of control, out of place, we will demolish this religion that you have made. We will battle for our kingdom, we are more than conquers.---Lyrics submitted by ben.
