In The House Of Mourning: Martyr! I saw the dead before the throne. Martyr! I saw the dead before the throne. The ending is better the beginning. What has been given will last forever, nothing added nothing taken away. In this time when injustice seems to prevail we are without failure. So what do you fear? Its going to get harder and harder. I scream martyr in the house of mourning. The temporaries fleeting with eternity in our hearts. Our song will always remain, with all authority. The ending is better than the beginning. What has been given will last forever, may these words not diminish with short term memories, but may the echoes resonate eternity. Manifested through me. So what do you fear? I scream martyr in the house of mourning. Our song will always remain with all authority.---Lyrics submitted by ben.
