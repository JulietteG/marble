The waves surround me, I'm slowly drowning
As I'm crying out for help
Grabbing hold of anything that looks
Like it can carry me through the night
And I -- I look up and then I see
Your hand reaching for me
Then I sing

[Chorus:]
My Jesus, my Father
The One who is stronger than the storm
My Hero, my only hope, You are
My Savior

The sea starts raging, I'm quickly fading
As I take my eyes off You
Reality kicks in, and fear rises within
My soul and all of my faith is gone
But oh -- once again You take my hand
You lead me to dry land
Then I cry

[Repeat Chorus:]

You never grow tired or weary
You always hear my cry
Forever You'll be there beside me
Be lifted high

The waves surround me, I'm slowly drowning
As I'm crying out for help
Grabbing hold of anything that looks
Like it can carry me through the night
And I -- I look up and then I see
Your hand reaching for me
Then I sing

[Chorus:]
My Jesus, my Father
The One who is stronger than the storm
My Hero, my only hope, You are
My Savior

The sea starts raging, I'm quickly fading
As I take my eyes off You
Reality kicks in, and fear rises within
My soul and all of my faith is gone
But oh -- once again You take my hand
You lead me to dry land
Then I cry

[Repeat Chorus:]

You never grow tired or weary
You always hear my cry
Forever You'll be there beside me
Be lifted high
