Is it fair to say 
I was lured away
by endless distractions
and lonlier attractions, then?

Or fairer still, 
my own free will
is the better one to blame
for this familiar mess I've made, again?

So I would understand
if You were out of patience;
and I would understand
if I was out of chances...

And Your mercies are new every morning
so let me wake with the dawn.
When the music is through,
or though it seems to be,
let me sing a new song:  old things gone

Every day it's true
You make all Your mercies new.

The distance left
between east and west
is how far You would go
to forget the debt I owe, oh.

And thrown into the sea,
the wicked ways in me
will never have a chance
to wash back on the sand.

So I would understand
if You would make me pay;
and I would understand
lying in the bed I've made, again.

But your mercies are new every morning
so let me wake with the dawn.
When the music is through,
or though it seems to be,
let me sing a new song:  old things gone.

Every day it's true
You make all Your mercies new.

Out comes the sun
on every one of us!
And gone, gone, gone
the guilt and shame who knew your name!

Your mercies are new every morning
so let me wake with the dawn!
And when the music is through,
or though it seems to be,
let me sing a new song:  old things gone!

Every day it's true
You make all Your mercies new. 
(Bebo Norman:  every day it's true You make all Your mercies new)
Every day it's true
You make all Your mercies, all of Your mercies new.---Lyrics submitted by Alli.
