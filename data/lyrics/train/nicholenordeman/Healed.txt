Oh, We stutter and we stammer till You save us 
A symphony of chaos till You play us 
Phrases on the pages of unknown 
Til You read us into poetry and prose 
We are kept and we are captive till You free us 
Vaguely unimagined til You dream us 
Aimlessly unguided til You lead us home 

CHORUS: 
By Your voice we speak 
By Your strength no longer weak 
We are no longer weak 
And by Your wounds we are healed 
And by Your wounds we are healed 

Passed over and passed by until you claim us 
Orphaned and abandoned til you name us 
Hidden and disclosed til you expose you hearts 

CHORUS: 
By your death we live 
It is by your gift that we might give 
That we might give 
And by your wounds we are healed 
And by your wounds we are healed 

What kind of love would take your
shame and spill his blood for you 
Save us by His wounds 
By your wounds, we are healed 
By your wounds, we are healed 
What kind of love 
By your wounds, we are healed 
Tell me what kind of love is this 
By your wounds, we are healed---Lyrics submitted by Lexi.
