Heres to you
You were pink or blue
And everything I wanted
Heres to you
Never sleeping through
From midnight till the morning
Had to crawl before you walked
Before you ran
Before I knew it
You were trying to free your fingers from my hand
Cause you could it on your own now somehow

Slow down
Wont you stay here a minute more
I know you want to walk through the door
But its all too fast
Lets make it last a little while
I pointed to the sky and now you wanna fly
I am your biggest fan
I hope you know I am
But do you think you can somehow
Slow down

Heres to you
Every missing tooth
Every bedtime story
Heres to Barbie cars, light saber wars
Sleeping in on Sunday
Had to crawl
Before you walked
Before you ran
Before I knew it
You were teaching me
The only thing love can
Hold hands through it
When its scary, youve got me

Slow down
Wont you stay here a minute more
I know you want to walk through the door
But its all too fast
Lets make it last a little while
I pointed to the sky and now you wanna fly
I am your biggest fan
I hope you know I am
But do you think you can somehow
Slow down

Please dont roll your eyes at me
I know Im embarrassing
But someday youll understand
Youll hold a little hand
Ask them if they can

I am your biggest fan
I hope you know I am
But do you think you can
Somehow
Slow down
Slow down---
