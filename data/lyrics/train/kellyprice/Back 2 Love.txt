(feat. Ruben Studdard)

Ill be working hard all week 
And I cant wait to put my arms around you 
Its so hard to be without you 
Will you come to me 
Right now I feel a little love sick 
Try to get the week and started 

And time to get back to love 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to love 
We gotta get back 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to us 

Time just seems to fly when Im with you 
You are my guilty pleasure 
make this moment last forever 
Stop, lets press replay 
Make love again and again and again 
It never had to end 

Let the world just fall apart yeah 
Let the world just fall apart yeah 
While we get back to love 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to us 

And if the world goes crazy 
And if the world goes to an end 
Long as you are right here with me 
As log as is you 

Let the world just fall apart 
While we get back to love 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to us 

Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to us 

We gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to us 

Let the world just fall apart 
Gotta get back to trust 
Gotta get back to love 
Gotta get back to us ---
