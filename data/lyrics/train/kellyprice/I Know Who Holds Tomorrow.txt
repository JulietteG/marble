I don't know about tomorrow
I just live from day to day
I don't borrow from it's sunshine
for its sky may turn to gray.

So I don't worry about my future
For I know what Jesus said
And today he walks [right] beside me
For He knows what lies ahead

[My Storm survivors]

Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand
But I - I know who holds
I know, I know, I know who holds tomorrow
And I-I know, who holds, [thank you Jesus] who holds my hand.---Lyrics submitted by Marquita.
