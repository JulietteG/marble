January 1 
ive got alot of things on my mind
I'm lookin' at my body through news by satallite
Try to lift a finger but
I dont think i can make the call
So tell me if i move, cuz i don't feel anything at all
Oh oh oh

(chorus)
So carry me
I'm just a dead man,
Laying on a carpet
Can't find a hearbeat
Make me free
I wanna be a new man,
Tired of the old one,
Out with the old plan

I woke up from a dream about an empty funeral
But it was better than a party full of people I don't really know
Well they've got hearts to break and burn
Dirty hands to feel the earth
There's somethin' in my veins
But I can't seem to make it work, oh work

(chorus)

Can you find a beat
Inside of me
Any pulse, getting worse
Any pulse, getting worse
Inside of me
can you find a beat

(chorus) x 2---Lyrics submitted by yizel.
