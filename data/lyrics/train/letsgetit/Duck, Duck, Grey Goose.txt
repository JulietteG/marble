You've got nerves, that's okay babe.
Cuz I've got time, I'll give you all day.
I am the king of this town.
I'm sure you'll come around.
Just wait 'till you see the crown.

I hate to say I'm a pro at this game
To throw the towel now would put my name to shame
So, let's set the pace to our beating hearts
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish we started sooner...

I'm sure all she saw was
A waterfall of champagne
We make it rain
All day, all day, everyday.

I'm sure all she saw was
A waterfall of champagne
We make it rain
All day, all day, everyday.

And as you enter the room you're post goes wild.
Like a wild storm through a mild town
You're just hanging on for the ride
(There's beasts and then there's prey)
For some it's a choice, for most it's the way
We talk about you.
We almost have you.
We're all around you.
So glad we found you!

I'm sure all she saw was
A waterfall of champagne
We make it rain
All day, all day, everyday.

I'm sure all she saw was
A waterfall of champagne
We make it rain
All day, all day, everyday.

Hey darlin' shake the stars from your eyes
Make your way to my room
I'll give you a surprise it's...
Glistening and shining
So brightly it's blinding

Hey darlin' shake the stars from your eyes
Make your way to my room
I'll give you a surprise it's...
Glistening and shining
So brightly it's blinding

(Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
I give you the one and the only Let's Get It!)

Ladada Ladadada
Ladada Ladadada
Ladada Ladadada

Look simply get a picture of this
Another bandage for this broken thing
Good God Almighty this ain't a scene
It's such a catastrophe

Look simply get a picture of this
Another bandage for this broken thing
Good God Almighty this ain't a scene
It's such a catastrophe
