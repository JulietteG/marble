(Tell me how bad)

Well fashioned entrances tend to turn heads
I came to break necks
And get in their beds
They won't deny me what I came to see
Cuz they all wanna be number one on my team

Tell me how bad...do you want it?
Oh you want it... (Uh.)

I'm throwin' all kinds of fire
And by you're attire
I see you admire
My walk.  My pose.  You come to all my shows
And you think I never notice
Well it's time for you to show me just...

How you say that you're game
Talk to whatever, whenever, you'll be there for the way...what?
Well today is you're day
And games I don't play

Just move when I say...

Tell me how bad
Do you want it?
Oh you want it
Well how far is too far?
This is the sign
That you've been waiting for
Grab your composure
Cuz baby it's check out time.

Tell me how bad
Do you want it?
Oh you want it
Well how far is too far?
This is the sign
That you've been waiting for
Grab your composure
Cuz baby it's check out time.

And I....

I'll stay up waiting in the lobby 'till I see you there
One at a time up to our room
Make sure nobody sees you creeping, discreetly
Just them wondering what we're doing

The elevator is building anticipation
And we both are sick of waiting
Hearts tired from pacing, yeah.
In my mind, you're mine...

Tell me how bad
Do you want it?
Oh you want it
Well how far is too far?
This is the sign
That you've been waiting for
Grab your composure
Cuz baby it's check out time.

Tell me how bad
Do you want it?
Oh you want it
Well how far is too far?
This is the sign
That you've been waiting for
Grab your composure
Cuz baby it's check out time.

How many times must I tell you?
We're second best to no one. (Uh, yeah)
How many times must I tell you?
We're second best to no one.
How many times must I tell you?
We're second best to no one. (Haha,)
How many times must I tell you?
We're second best to no one.

Tell me how bad...

Do you want it?
Oh you want it
Well how far is too far?
This is the sign
That you've been waiting for
Grab your composure
Cuz baby it's check out time.

Tell me how bad
Do you want it?
Oh you want it
Well how far is too far?
This is the sign
That you've been waiting for
Grab your composure
Cuz baby it's check out time.

(Let's get it playing, boy.  Take your watch.  It's our time)
Tell me how bad
(Haha, uh)
