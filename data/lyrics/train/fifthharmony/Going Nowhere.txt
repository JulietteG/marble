Lauren:
First off, give a girl some credit
I'ma gonna keep on loving you, 'cause you be the realest
All day and all night and that's why you stay by my side

Ally:
I don't always do the right thing
It doesn't matter, 'cause nobody's perfect here no
If you leave, I can't make you stay

Fifth Harmony:
Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?

Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?

Camila:
Sit yourself down, 'cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say

Fifth Harmony:
You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

Boy, you better act like you got some sense,
'Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent

You ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

Dinah:
We'll be here all day, if you start pointing fingers my way
I just wished you loved me, loved me, baby
If you can do that then I'll do the same, yeah

Camila:
Mmm we can make it work, baby
We'd be crazy if we don't try
Love and hate is such a thin line

Fifth Harmony (Ally ad-libs):
Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?

Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?

Dinah & Lauren:
If you're gonna play games you're gonna lose
You'll be sorry if you say goodbye

Dinah, Ally & Normani:
Yeah I still want you, but I don't need you
You should be happy I'm still here for you
I don't have to be, you must be blind if you can't see

Fifth Harmony (Dinah ad-libs):
Where you going, where you tryna go (Camila: where you tryna go)
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby?
