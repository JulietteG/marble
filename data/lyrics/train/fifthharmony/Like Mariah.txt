Love it when you call me baby
When you're lighting up my phone
Make me want you like I'm crazy
I'm running home, I'm running home
Just to hear your heartbeat
So sweet like honey comb
I gotta have you near me, 'cause you're the best I've ever known

You make me get up, get up
Like this is my song
I'ma get up, get up yah yah
You got me humming, humming
To the beat of the drum
To the rhythm, rhythm yah yah

But I don't need to make a wish, 'cause all I want is you
