We were together
We were just strangers
I was just playing around
So I didn't wanna work it out
Didn't wanna work it out
Got something else missing
We were too different
Baby I've been looking back now
And I really should have worked it out
Yeah, I really should have worked it out
Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back cause I

Boy I miss you, said I really do, boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you, said I really really do, boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, you know we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, you know we're better together

Watching you wake up, thinking I had you, I was like 'I was so dumb'
Boy I should have known that you're the one
Boy I should have known that you're the one
So, if it's not too late, I just wanna know boy, if we can still be one
Cause I finally know that you're the one
Yeah, I really know that you're the one
Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back cause I

Boy I miss you, said I really do, boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you, said I really really do, boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, you know we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, you know we're better together

And now that you're gone and I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back cause I
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, you know we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, you know we're better together

Boy I miss you, said I really do, boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you, said I really really do, boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
We're better, we're better, we're better, we're better
We're better, you know we're better together ---
