It's over today
The heat is gone
Time is gone
F for fake
I feel no wrong
Hide no wrong
I love this place
The lights....
Under this face
So dry....
Only way to change
Give yourself away
Don't be ashamed
Next in line; close one eye
Just walk by
In these days
I'm breathing stone, crying alone
I'll win this race
I'll leave alone, arrive alone
Love this place, the lights...
Under this face, so dry...
Stripped to the bone
I did no wrong
Truth is my name
Give yourself away---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
