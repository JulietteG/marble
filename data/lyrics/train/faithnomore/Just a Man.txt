Sky is clear tonight
Sky is clear tomorrow

A star is out
I reach for one to sparkle in my hand
A star is out
I will not touch you I am and just a man

Sky is clear tonight
Sky is clear tomorrow

-And every night I shut my eyes
So I don't have to see the light
Shining so bright
I'll dream about a cloudy sky,
A cloudy sky

"Man was born to love-
Though often he has sought
Like Icarus, to fly to high
And far too lonely then he ought
To kill the sun of east and west
And hold the world as his behest
Just a man

To hold the terrible power
To whom only gods are blessed-
But me, I am just a man"

--And every night I shut my eyes
So I don't have to see the light
Shining so bright
I'll dream about a cloudy sky,
A cloudy sky

And every night I shut my eyes
But now I've got them open wide
You've fallen into my hands
And now you're burning me
And now you're burning me---Lyrics submitted by grace.
