We care a lot
We care a lot
We care a lot about disasters, fires, floods and killer bees
about the nasa shuttle falling in the sea
about starvation and the food that Live Aid bought
about disease, baby, Rock Hudson, Rock Yeah!

(chorus)

We care a lot
We care a lot
We care a lot about the gamblers and the pushers and the geeks
about the smack and crack and wack that hits the streets 
about the welfare of all you boys and girls
about you people cause we're out to save the world

Yeah!

(chorus) And it's a dirty job but someone's got to do it!

We care a lot about the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines
about the NY, SF, and LAPD
about you people, about your guns
about the wars we'er fighting
gee, that looks like fun

We care a lot 
about the garbage pail kids they never lie
about transformers cause theres more then meets the eye
about the little things the bigger days we die
about you people, yeah, you bet we care a lot

(chorus) And it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it....---Lyrics submitted by will.
