ALMOST, sweet talk, CAFFEINE
Make contact
Up to my neck
I confess in quicksand
"But it's so easy for you"
"There's always one thing"
"Do you have something to tell me?"
"Say something"
"Anything"
"I'm warning you"
"I'm warning you"
"I'm fucking you"
"I'm warning you"
"Relax"
"It's just a phase"
"You'll grow out of it"
Believe anything anyone ever tells you
It's not funny any more
It's thing you hate the most
The thing you hate the most
The thing you hate ALMOST---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
