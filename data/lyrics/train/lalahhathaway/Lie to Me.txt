Tonight I wont put up a fight
Just meet me on the side of the bed
Before a feud, dont say a word
Words never get us anywhere
Remember the girl you used to desire
A spark turned into a wild fire
Its burning our love downnow Im aware

I cant be mad at you cause nothing last forever
but I beg of you to play along
hold me till Im strong 

Chorus:
Baby lie to me tonight, ohh 
Give me at least til tomorrow 
Before you walk out in my life 
Could you lie to me tonight, ooh 
Let me borrow your heart until tomorrow 
Then Ill give it back to you 
Lie to me tonight ooh 
Baby lie, baby lie with me tonight 
Baby lie, Let me borrow your heart until tomorrow 
Then Ill give it back 

Say you only have eyes for me 
Im the prettiest girl in the whole world 
Let my hair down for me please 
Worship my body like a temple 
I act surprised like the first time
Ill consider it all little white lies
I just wanna feel your love, baby, for the record.

I cant be mad at you cause nothing last forever
But I beg of you to play along
This time Ill be strong 

Chorus:
Baby lie to me tonight, ohh 
Give me at least til tomorrow 
Before you walk out in my life 
Could you lie to me tonight, ooh 
Let me borrow your heart until tomorrow 
Then Ill give it back 
Lie to me tonight 
Baby lie, baby lie with me tonight 
Baby lie, Let me borrow your heart until tomorrow 
Then Ill give it back 

Im so scared to open my eyes 
Dont wanna see the truth on your face
Too much passion
the love Im giving you, you wont reciprocate
Can you kiss away the pain tonight ?
Fighting to hold the tears inside
Just make my body crave it.

Chorus:
Could you lie to me tonight ooh 
Give me at least until the morning 
Hold me till Im strong 
Would you lie to me tonight ooh 
Give me at least til tomorrow 
Before you walk out of my life 
Lie to me tonight 
Let me borrow your heart until tomorrow 
Then Ill give it back to you.
Lie to me tonight ooh 
Baby lie, baby lie with me tonight 
Let me borrow your heart until tomorrow.

Hey yeah. Ooo wahh---Lyrics submitted by Lukas Kasdan.
