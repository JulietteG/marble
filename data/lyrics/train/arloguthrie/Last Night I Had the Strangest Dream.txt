Last night i dreamed the strangest dream
i ever had before
i dreamed the world had all agreed
to put an end to war

I dreamed i saw a mighty room
all filled with women and men
and the paper they were signing said
they'd never fight again

and when the papers were all signed
and a million copies made
they all joined hands and bowed their heads
and grateful prayers were prayed

and the people in the streets below
were dancing round and round
and guns and swords and uniforms
were scattered on the ground

Last night i had the strangest dream
i ever dreamed before
i dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war---Lyrics submitted by steven.
