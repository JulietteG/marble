De colores, in bright colors the fields decorated are clothed now in spring. De colores, in bright colors the birds soon return and their happy songs bring. De colores, in bright colors a rainbow of light spans the beautiful sky. Y por e so los gran des a mor es de muchos colores me gustan a mi. For our friends far and near come to be with us here and will color our lives once again. De colores, view the colors around when the sunlight awakens the day. De colores, view the colors in sight as the sun shines its glorious rays. De colores, view the colors it makes, as a diamond it lights up the sky, Y por e so los gran des a mor es de muchos colores me gustan a mi. For our friends far and near come to be with us here and will color our lives once again. De colores de colores y por e so los gran des a mor es de mu chos colores me gustan a mi.---Lyrics submitted by Grant.
