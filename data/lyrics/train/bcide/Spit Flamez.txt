Ive been lookin for ways outta the game, spit flame
Cocaine on the brain makes ya goin insane
Get cash my stash, off the top of the bag
I just got a lil something never paid for that
In fact, move back, thats the way to react
Step right to the side or youre feelin my wrath
A the only mothafucka with it right on my mind
I bitch slapped ya motha when I was writin this rhyme
Can you vibe wit me, coincide wit me, if you can
Then you wanna plan a robbery?
Im so hard to see, but supposed to be
If you do it right, then you get on top of me
Move it up and down, my town the town
3-1-5 and everything that surrounds
Drum rolls that roll, Rolexes and exs
My sex is superb, and herb that rolls
Follows me to shows, orgies wit hoes
No I suppose, when we goin on tour find fans and foes
People wanna smoke, hit the tour bus doe
Knock three times and do-si-do
If you see po-po, stash the smoke
Look em right in the eyes, tell em he just dont know
Got to go, 16 years old
Lovin every minute but ya just dont know
On the down-low like downloads illegal
MP3s, and ya burnin my album its a form of flattery
Ya see---Lyrics submitted by Ronnie.
