Hook (x2)

Jump up, if ya wanna fight now
Start a fuckin riot, get the club shut down
If ya wanna get it poppin, we can start the hatchet choppin
Have you leakin out your top and wheezing for your last breath

B-Cide

It took some time, but I got the patience
Lurk and strike quick like a rapist
They try to find me, its all gayness
Im too smart for you ignoramus
Now Im on the hunt, I smell fresh bacon
Its all them pigs congregatin
Plottin and planning the words of Satan
Take em all out wit the CKC nation
Bloody and useless, hadda just do it
Never seen or heard, its a shysty movement
Get up in the club, start a fight club
Find the mothafucka, go and yolk his ass up
I wanna hear bass, silence the violence
Turn it up real loud cuz its gonna get violent
Dance, dance, stomp, stomp
Get crunk you fuck
Or youll end up in my trunk
Amazed by the maze when it fell from grace
But I think God slapped you in yo face
How ya gonna talk when you look like that?
I could finish the job with a baseball bat
Leave you all fucked up, bones are broken
Feed you to the lions like an old school Roman
Julius Caesa, nice to meet ya
I like ya salad, but Id rather eat pizza

Lil Billa

Ya betta back up when Lil Billa come through
I like to fight, but love to shoot
I wont hesitate to bust, wont hesitate to bump
Ill leave ya body slumped or up in the trunk
I keep the club crunk, I keep the club poppin
Try if ya want, but their aint no stopping
Ya girls booty poppin, Im gon stay droppin
Just cuz ya heard my album wasnt floppin
Haters stay jockin, they wanna be me
Try to catch me slippin, now R.I.P.
Ill leave dat ass beat, found under a seat
Now Im startin a riot in the V.I.P.
Betta call the police, you betta call the law
Aw man, too late I done broke yo jaw
I go get a saw, Ill go get a bat
Hit you wit dat and leave that ass flat
Now how ya like that, how ya really feel now
Ya wanna be tough boy, but ya got shut down
Get left wit a frown, beat down and bruised
Keepin poppin at the mouth you gon make the news
Im sicka then the flu, Ill kill like AIDS
You the two of clubs Im the Ace of spades
Respect what I say, Im a dog in the pound
So everybody jump and start a fight now
