I was doin' fine on my own
Then you came around cold as stone
Said don't worry. won't ask much
Well thats all right I'm just lookin' for a touch

You tried to give my body hell
But I'm not the one to kiss and tell
You said you'd stick to my skin
Now my hearts beatin' faster and I`m given' in

Chorus
Don't touch me there
'Cause thats my heart
I told you that right from the start
You should have played it cool
Should have played it smart
Don't touch me there
Cause thats my heart

I've been hurt and abused
And I thought Id paid my dues
I wanted no ties to hold me down
Was runnin` free till you came around

You. now you're gettin' too close
Your grip's closin' in and I`m losin' all hope
You, you said your love would't stay
Now I can`t keep love away

Chorus
You think you know me well
But you're not the one that's been put through hell
You, you're layin' under my skin
My hearts beatin' faster
And I'm gettin' in
