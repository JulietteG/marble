It's getting late, late, late
And I wanna do the things you like
I'll break, break, break all the rules, set me free
'Cause I think I found the one for tonight
And I'm burning high 'cause you're doing it right
[x2]

I wasn't looking when you caught my eye
And then it hit me, I was falling from the sky
Will you be the one who catches me?
Will I ever know your name?

Every time I look at you
You got me hypnotized by the face you do
And I know all I want is to be with you
Come on, let's make it happen tonight

It's getting late, late, late
And I wanna do the things you like
I'll break, break, break all the rules, set me free
'Cause I think I found the one for tonight
And I'm burning high 'cause you're doing it right
[x2]

I saw your smile and I was mesmerized
You had it all and it was easy to decide
So tell me how we're gonna play this game
Do you wanna say my name?

Now it's time to let it show
We gotta let our love come over you and me
And I want to let you know
'Cause it's all in the name of love

It's getting late, late, late
And I wanna do the things you like
I'll break, break, break all the rules, set me free
'Cause I think I found the one for tonight
And I'm burning high 'cause you're doing it right

It's getting late, late, late
And I wanna do the things you like
I'll break, break, break all the rules, set me free
'Cause I think I found the one for tonight
And I'm burning high 'cause you're doing it right
