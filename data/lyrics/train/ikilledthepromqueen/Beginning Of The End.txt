Please take me back to the start
Where we still hold this close, to our hearts
I wont let it tear us apart 
Please take me back to the time
Where you can see the light, in my eyes
And you knew that my love will never die

I knew youll never die

Please take me back to the time
Where you can see the light, in my eyes
And you knew that my love will never die---Lyrics submitted by Dylan Tipple.
