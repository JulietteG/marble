I curse your name,
I curse the earth you travelled
With a heart so serrated it draws lacerations across the hands
You used to hold so tightly up until now
I'm glad farewells were exchanged before today

This phrase has never sounded so sweet to my ears
I don't mourn this act or mourn for you, I mourn for you
and with those encounters still installed in my mind
I leave with a putrid taste inside my mouth
every living thing on this earth dies alone, dies alone
this phrase never sounded so sweet to my ears
every living thing on this earth dies alone, dies alone
this phrase never sounded so sweet to my ears

with reason enough to curse the earth you walk from
those final encounters stuck, stuck in my mind
the scent of abhorrence still lingers
part your exit
this moment is only married by thoughts of your presence

I curse your name and the earth you're walking on

Everything living on this earth dies alone...
Everything living on this earth dies alone...
Everything living on this earth dies alone...
Everything living on this earth dies alone...

These scornful thoughts resurrect to the sound of that name.
the scent of abhorrence still lingers here
to look at those lacerations
with no chance to heal, no chance to, heal

these scornful thoughts linger on
these scornful thoughts linger on
these scornful thoughts linger on---Lyrics submitted by michael.
