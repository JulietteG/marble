So here I stand, breathless, waiting for nothing.
Peer into my chest.
See if, this things still ticking.
Another victim, to that power that no one gave you.
Standing all alone, I've realized I'm not giving up.
The first time this touched me, I became, an invention called zero.
So as I walk from this earth, I'm taking you with me.
Existence will fall.. down.
Betrayed, security.. fails.
All hail your faithless god.. lies.
Slain upon thy faithful sword.. trust.
I will not bow.
Compassion is locked inside, and I'm holding the useless key.
So here I stand, just waiting for nothing.
Peer into my chest, rip me apart.
As this lethal injection runs cold, through my veins.
Lights in my head slowly fade out, I'm in the dark again.
There will be no tolerance, for those with no respect.
Standing all alone, I've realized, I'm not giving up.
If I walk this earth, ill still take you with me.
I'm sure these keys will open.
A vile passion..
Praying hands won't save purity.
Praying won't save purity.
As this lethal injection runs cold, through my veins.
Lights in my head slowly fade out, I'm in the dark again.
All hail your faceless god.
Slain upon thy faithful sword.
All hail your faceless god.
Slain upon thy faithful sword.
Still I refuse to bow.---Lyrics submitted by ryan.
