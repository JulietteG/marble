We were a half mile high on the ferris wheel
at our old county fair
I didn't even know we had trouble until
she told me way up there
Thats when my life started spinning round
My world came crashing to the ground

The day that she left tulsa
In a cevy in hurry in the pouring down rain
with the caution lights flashing in the passing lane
From a bridge I watch our dreams going down the drain
In a chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain

No she wasn't showing yet
but she'd be by christmas time
up there I like a fool I took
for granted it was mine
She never came out and told me that I was wrong
but all of the sudden the light came on

The day that she left Tulsa
in a chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
With the caution lights flashing in the passing lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams going down the drain
In a chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain

I guess she thought the truth would end up driving me away
Well she was wrong, but I never had the chance to say

The day that she left Tulsa
In a chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
In a chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain

In a chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
With the causion lights flashing in the passing lane
From a bridge I watched our dreams going down the drain
In a chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain

In a chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain
In a chevy in a hurry in the pouring down rain---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Showman.
