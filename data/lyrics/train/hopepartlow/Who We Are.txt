I don't wanna put on my makeup. Just like every girl in a mazigine. Thats who i am when i wake up thats not who i wanna be.Their is so much more to me than meet the eye in this life i know one thing.

(Chrous:)
      it reall dosent matterwhat you wear let the people stare
coz we are who we are who we are who we are it 
dosen't really matter what car you drive its good to be alive
yeah we are who we are who we are who we are
                     ~~WHO WE ARE~~

Tell me baby do i look like the real thing. Would you chcange the color of my eyes?
Tell me why my televisions filling me with lies? 

Chrous:

There is beauty on the inside.YEAH YOUR BEAUTIFUL!! ALRIGHT

CHROUS:X2

Its good to be alive X2

It dosent really matter what car you drive its good to be alive

yeah we are who we are who we are who we are. Who we are Its good to be alive Good to be alive.
