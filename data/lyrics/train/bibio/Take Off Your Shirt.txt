Saturday, when the hair comes down
All the girls in town gonna dress the place
In blue-eyed green-eyed brown-eyed light
All the boys with desire of night
Gonna lose their feet gonna lose their mind
In drinking fighting sweat and lust
We play the game of weaving ducking dodging hiding
Through the hormonal battle on the streets
Then we reach our destination
It is consolation for star-people constellation
Sadness in rags won't feel the pain
Of sadness in silks and golden chains
Take off your shirt
And give it to the one with fur coats and shiny shoes
On Sunday when the streets are bare
Reminders of the party there
Red devil horns dropped in the road
Tiaras made of plastic gold
A bloody puddle stains the floor
Outside the boarded nightclub door
And all the one night love is jaded
When all the memories have faded...---Lyrics submitted by Jameson Adame.
