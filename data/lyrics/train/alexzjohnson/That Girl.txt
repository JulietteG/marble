You said you didn't need me (but you did)
You said you didn't want me (but you do)
It's kinda like a comedy
Well first you kiss me 
And then you say we're through
I say you got some issues (yeah you do)
Some things you gotta work through (really do)
It's sorta like a talk show, no wait a freak show
When the freak is you

I'm the smoke from your fire
I'm that lie you can trust
I'm the chord on your guitar
I'm that girl you can't shut up
I'm the blood you might need
In your car when you speed
In that cigarette you breathe
You can't get rid of me

You said I wasn't funny (but you laughed)
You said I couldn't drive fast (then you crashed)
Funny how it works out 
With your big mouth
You'll always get it back 
You thought you had me worked out (you're not deep)
Mr. I screw about (you're still a creep)
At best you could've confessed
That you're a big mess
And that you're so damn weak

I'm the smoke from your fire
I'm that lie you can trust
I'm the chord on your guitar
I'm that girl you can't shutup
I'm the blood you might need
In your car when you speed
In that cigarette you breathe
You can't get rid of me

But still, I try and justify 
Try to let this die
We'll never say goodbye i can't wait
I'll rub it in your face
Dressed in pretty lace
I'll send you home, to cry

Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha 

I'm that blood you might need
In your car when you speed
In that cigarette you breathe
You can't get rid of me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[repeat 3x]

You can't get rid of me---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
