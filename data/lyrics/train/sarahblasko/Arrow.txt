Higher just like an arrow,
Heading straight for a destiny.
And no one and nothing can take that away from me.
It's something that defies what the eye can see.

And nothing and no one is as real.
And it's pure and as dark as a dream.

I was just like a sailor,
Heading out to uncharted seas.
I thought that the limit was the horizon
Discovered there was more than the eye could see.

And nothing and no one is as real.
And it's pure and as dark as a dream.
And nothing, no, nothing lasts forever.
And I take heart in all  I cannot see

I was just like an arrow,
Heading straight for a destiny.
Then I met you, and a world opened up in front of me
Revealing there was more than the eye could see.---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
