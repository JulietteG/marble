Im awake, no Im not scared,
Shot an apple off my head
Fire and ice, all in between
Of this world, and all unseen
No one knows just why were here
Embrace the doubt and face the fear
Its all about the inner search
To be a hunter gatherer
Im going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
o-oh-oh-oh
Im going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
o-oh-oh-oh

I awake unto this day, Im going out to make a change
Ive fallen down, and gotten u,
Been searching everywhere for love
Ive let it go, welcomed it in
I wear the scars upon my skin
The stroke was real, the force is great
My heart is an adventurer,
Im going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
o-oh-oh-oh
Im going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
o-oh-oh-oh

Ive tried to make this life my own
To find myself, Ive searched alone
To let love go and let it in
I found it burning like a sin
Ive worked it out, but learned it hard
Its sad inside and life is out
Till I wont settle down and watch either way
Im going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
o-oh-oh-oh
Im going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
o-oh-oh-oh
Im going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
o-oh-oh-oh
Im going o-oh-oh-oh-oh-o-oh
o-oh-oh-oh---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
