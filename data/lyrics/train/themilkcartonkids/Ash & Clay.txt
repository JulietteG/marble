The swing sets are empty like dirt turned the dark of the night
The center of this town it used to whirl in the glow of twilight
It might look like god's away with all the trouble these days
We'll come home before the girls are grown
We're coming home tonight

What, oh, have we done to run this country into such a sight
Stolen from our brothers like we couldn't find a fair enough fight
You wait on promise you will say
Won't forsake the ash and clay
Let's come home before the girls are grown
Let's come home to fight

I know we want whats best for usi know it has to come at a price
I also know the trouble that you find when you stop being nice
You look around you one day
What you once knew didn't stay
Let's come home before the girls are grown
Let's come home tonight

Have you ever asked a man to take your place at the head of the table?
You could shed away your shame if in the end you found you simply weren't able
You might find out you could stay
On the ash and on the clay
Come on home before the girls are grown
Come on home tonight

Come on home before the girls are grown
Come on home to fight ---
