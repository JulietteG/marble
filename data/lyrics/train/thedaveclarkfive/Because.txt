It's right that I should care about you
and try to make you happy when you're blue.
It's right, it's right to feel the way I do
Because, because I love you.

It's wrong to say I don't think of you.
Cause when you say these things
you know it makes me blue.

Give me one kiss and I'll be happy
just, just to be with you.
Give me, give me, a chance to be near you
because, because I love you.

(Break) 

Give me one kiss and I'll be happy
just, just to be with you. 
Give me, give me a chance to be near you.
because, because I love you. 
because, because I love you.---Lyrics submitted by Peggy.
