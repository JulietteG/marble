Ain't it foggy outside
All the planes have been grounded
Ain't the fire inside?
Lets all go stand around it

Funny I've been there
And you've been here
We ain't had no time to drink that beer

'Cause I understand
You've been running from the man
That goes by the name of the Sandman
He flies the sky
Like an eagle in the eye of a
Hurricane that's abandoned

Ain't the years gone by fast
I suppose you have missed them
Oh,  I almost forgot to ask
Did you hear of my enlistment

I understand you've been
Running from the man
That goes by the name of the Sandman
He flies the sky
Like an eagle in the eye of a
Hurricane that's abandoned

                     From the L.P.,(1971 1st issue and 1972 reissue) self titled, "America" by America
