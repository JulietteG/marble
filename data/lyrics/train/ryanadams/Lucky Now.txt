I don't remember, were we wild and young
All that's faded into memory
I feel like somebody I don't know
Are we really who we used to be
Am I really who I was

The lights will draw you in 
And the dark will bring you down
And the night will break your heart
Only if you're lucky now

Waitin outside while you find your keys 
Like bags of trash in the blackening snow
City of neon and toes that freeze
We got nothing and nowhere to go
We got nothing and nowhere

And the lights will draw you in
And the dark will take you down
And the night will break your heart
Only if you're lucky now

If the lights draw you in
And the dark can take you down
And love can mend your heart
But only if you're lucky now

I don't remember were we wild and young
All that's faded into memory
I feel like somebody I don't know
Are we really who we used to be
Am I really who I was---Lyrics submitted by Harmony E.
