In all my life, Mercy
Hasn't known my name this well
Like how every sea filters out
And leads us gently to a creek
We sit around

Some of us are strong
But the rest of us are weak
So let us down
But if you must

Let us down easy lord
Let us down easy lord
Let us down

In patches of pink clouds, Thick smoke
It comes rising off the hillside slopes
Down here this neighbourhood
It's just the dumps
With cars iced up, perfect for writing on if
You're wearing gloves

Every season i spend alone
Feels like a thousand in my heart and soul
So let me down if you must, But let us down
Easy lord, Let us down easy
Lord if you let us down

Instead of praying i tell god these jokes he must
Be tired of himself so much he must be more
Than disappointed christmas comes we eat alone
A pretty smile surrounds a pretty girl who
Takes your order she yells it and cries alone in
The backroom once in a while until it stops
So let her down easy if you must
But let her down easy
Some of us are strong
But te rest of us are weak
And go it alone
So let us down easy if you must
But let us down easy, Lord
Let us down easy lord, Let us down
Let us down, Easy---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
