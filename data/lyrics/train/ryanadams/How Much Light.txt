How much time do I have left for dreaming
All my life I've been searching for meaning
All my life I've never seen so much light

How much time 'til the wait is over and we
flicker in the night like the streetlights on the boulevard
with the moonless sky on an endless night
How much time

The way back home's through the wild and the winds
The way back home's in your arms
All my life I've been searching for someone and
I could never get it right
I could never get it right
I've never seen so much light

How much light 'til the ocean tips over and it
crashes on the beach like its blacker than it's bluer
Underneath the sun in a cloudless sky
How much light

How much sound 'til my name starts breaking
My hearts all done and it's yours for the taking
All my life I've never seen so much light

The way back home's through the wild and the winds
The way back home's in your arms
All my life I've been searching for something and
I could never get it right
I could never get it right
I could never get it right
And then i found you, I've never seen so much light
Seen so much light
So much light---
