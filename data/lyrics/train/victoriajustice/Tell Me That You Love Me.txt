Ohh yeah yeah
The situations turns around enough to figure out
That someone else has let you down
So many times I don't know why
But I know we can make it as long as you say it

So tell me that you love me yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
And maybe if you take one more than I would know for sure
There's nothing left to say
Tell me that you love me anyway
So Tell me that you love me anyway
Ohhh

Waking up beside yourself and what you feel inside
Is being shared with someone else
Nowhere to hide I don't know why
But I know we can make it
As long as you say it

So tell me that you love me yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
And maybe if you take one more than I would know for sure
There's nothing left to say
Tell me that you love me anyway

Show me look what we found turn it around every day
I can hear what you say
now I know why know we can make it
If tell me that you love me yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
And maybe if you take one more

So tell me that you love me yeah
And tell me that I take your breath away
Maybe if you take one more than I would know for sure
There's nothing left to say
Tell me that you love me anyway---Lyrics submitted by zarinaelif.
