Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Ah down beside that red fire light
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round

Hey I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew love before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me
Hey hey!

I've been singing with my band
Across the wire across the land
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them lovely ladies every time

Oh won't you take me home tonight
Oh down beside your red firelight
Oh and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round

Hey listen here
Now your mortgages and homes
And the stiffness in your bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality (I tell you)
Oh but I still get my pleasure
Still get my greatest treasure
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me

Oh you gonna take me home tonight (Please)
Oh down beside that red firelight
Oh you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
Get on your bikes and ride
Fat bottomed girls
Fat bottomed girls ---
