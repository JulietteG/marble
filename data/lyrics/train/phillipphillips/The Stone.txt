I've this creeping
Suspicion that things here are not
As they seem
Oh, reassure me
Why do I feel as if I'm in too deep?
Now, I've been praying
For some way to show them I'm not what they see
Yes, I have done wrong
But what I did I thought needed be done
I swear

Oh, unholy day
If I leave now I might get away
Oh, but this weighs on me
As heavy as stone and as blue as I go
I was just wondering if
You'd come along
Hold up my head when my head
Won't hold on
I'll do the same if the same's
What you want
But if not I'll go
I will go alone

I'm a long way
From that fool's mistake and
And now forever pay
No, run, I will run, and I'll be OK
But I was just wondering if
You'd come along
Hold up my head when my head
Won't hold on
I'll do the same if the same's
What you want
But if not I'll go
I will go alone

A long way
To bury the past
For I don't want to pay
Oh, how I wish this
To turn back the clock
And do over again
Now, I'm just wondering if
You'll come along
Hold up my head when my head
Won't hold on
I'll do the same if the same's
What you want
But if not I'll go
I will go alone

I need so
To stay in your arms, see you smile
Hold you close
And it weighs on me
As heavy as stone and
A bone chilling cold
I was just wondering if
You'd come along
Tell me you will---
