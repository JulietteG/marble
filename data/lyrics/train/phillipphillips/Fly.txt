When the day is done
The wait is on my mind
How should I give up?
How should I survive?
Meaning to the side off the busy street
Looking down these people
Never notice me
Am I the only one who things its hard to breathe?

I feel its hard to say whats on my mind
I feel its hard to say whats not inside
You think your fight is over
Its only so much closer
I reach my hands to the sky
And fly

Two thousand faces here but none will mind
Am I the only one with the reason behind?
Such a cool maze only to find another wall to break
Another wall to climb
Its when I lose myself and then I realize

I feel its hard to say whats on my mind
I feel its hard to say whats not inside
You think your fight is over
Its only so much closer
I reach my hands to the sky
And fly

I feel its hard to say whats on my mind
I feel its hard to say whats not inside
You think your fight is over
Its only so much closer
I reach my hands to the sky
And fly---
