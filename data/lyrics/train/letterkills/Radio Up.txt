Turn the radio up and we'll sing
A song to bring you back
Turn the radio up and we'll sing
A song

Turn the radio up and we'll sing
A song to bring you back
Turn the radio up and we'll sing
A song

(More than me)
You could never believe (More than me)
Here comes the sad part
Just making sure that you can see

(chorus:)
Something's right
Something's better off
Without you

A song

Check the volume on your heartbeat
Make sure it's loud as your last
Why don't you just hold on to this
You're, you're
Missing the point!

(More then me)
You never could believe (More than me)
Here comes the sad part
I'm just making sure that you can see

(chorus x2)

We could be better now
We could be better now
We could be better now
(Now you could believe)
We could be better now
(Now you could)

We could be better now
(Now you could believe)
We could be better now
(Now you could)

(chorus x3)

(Turn the radio up and we'll sing
A song to bring you back
Turn the radio up and we'll sing
A song
A song)

Turn the radio up and we'll sing
A song to bring to you back
Turn the radio up and we'll sing
A song---Lyrics submitted by Keep.
