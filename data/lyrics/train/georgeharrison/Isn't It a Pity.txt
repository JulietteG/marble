Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a shame
How we break each other's hearts,
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love,
Without thinking any more
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity.

Some things take so long, but how do I explain ?
When not too many people
Can see we're all the same
And because of all their tears,
Their eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them -
Oh, isn't it a pity.---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
