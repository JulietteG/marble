Wale   :
Pessimisn is all that she know
Cause every brother she go with
Always pick up and go
I been trying to show you something,
Got a different approach
Told her, "Give me your heart; try to
get you the globe"
Have the world baby girl, live it up
You deserve
Everytime she catch feelings she
Go throw away the gloves
We go together
Break up
We go together
Break up
Ain't this an insecure bitch,
Meaning we love to make up
When we good , we good shawty
We don't ever make love
But if I call you out your name,
I bet you're ready to "uh!"
You say you ready
You ain't ready enough
Cause when it fall right in your lap,
You be ready to get up
This her
This is it
This is sabotage love, counterfeit
She the shit, she the one
She got cold feet, 
My love will be the sun, Get it done
This is her
This it it
This is sabotage love, counterfeit
She the shit, she the one
She got cold feet
My love will be the sun,get it done

Lloyd    :
Cause I am feeling this deep down in my heart
I'm feeling like I never want to be apart
But just when it gets good, she's gone
And I'm left right back at start
My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah
She can only take so much more than her heart's got
She can only live for the moment
Why? I'll never know it
Guess I'll meet her right back at start

Wale     :
Let's roll a J and pretend we in love
I've got a paper plane
It's propellin my buzz
I'm trying to make a way
She never call back
She's tryna fall back
Cause she say I'm all that
She only love me when I be ignoring
When I be doing throwing it on her
Shorty brushing me off
I swear, I kinda feel like she's slightly bizarre
Sabotage all the time, having me Avatar'd
Blue ball, who fault?
Mine only cause I stick around
She leave before the sun up
Leave you something to think about
Yeah and this is something to think about
Why people want you single every time that you got a spouse
Ha, that make it hard to be faithful
Knowing I can go wherever and get 8 more
Ten more depening on where Wale going
Fuck it I got a few more now that my hair long
It's weird shawty
Your wares showing me dead wrong
You gon' miss a good thing and now bitter alone
Shit ain't better alone
I get her once I bet you keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for...

She ain't never needed love
Let her go
Let her leave
This is something that could never ever be
Said her hearts
In a cage
Cause if you never love
You can never hate
Marinate
