Silent night, holy night!
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender mild
Sleep in heavenly peace, 
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night!
Shepards quake at the sight!
Glories stream from heaven afar;
Heavenly hosts sing al-le-lu-ia!
Christ the saviour is born!
Christ the Saviour is born!

Silent night, holy night!
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face, 
Whith the dawn of redeeming grace,
Jesus Lord at thy birth;
Jesus Lord at thy birth---Lyrics submitted by Howdy.
