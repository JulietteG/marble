Overwhelmed and Uninspired
this communication breakdown
I'm in an ocean trying to stat a fire
from burning out
I know what I've got to do 
take my time and talk to you

(Chorus) 
On my knees flying through the blue sky
miles away
I see clearly every single time i close my eyes and 
Pray, Pray

I need a constant conversation
a heart to heart
long distance call
and when i start to feel the separation 
i will fall

(Chorus)

All my worries disapper  
When I'm standing here
On my knees flying through the blue sky
I'm here to stay

(Chorus)
Pray,Pray,Pray,Pray,Pray,Pray

I need a constant conversation
A heart to heart long distance call---Lyrics submitted by kendall.
