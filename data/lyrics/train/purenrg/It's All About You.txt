I just can't wipe it off
that smile on my face
i can't slow it down
my heart just beats half this pace
i've got a skip in my step and i like it that way
i've got a glow in my soul and it's there to stay
when i think about you
i just can't find it
when i think about you
there's nothing else

i just wanna sing and dance like everyday
don't wanna stop turn it down is that ok?
and when they ask whats got me going so crazy
i let 'em know it's all about you!

you got me ridin high
like i'm on top of the world
you got me feelin like
like nothing can stop me
i've got a skip in my step and i like that way
i've got a glow in my soul and it's there to stay

when i think about you
you love me this way
when i think about you
your amazing grace!

i just wanna sing and dance like every day 
don't wanna stop turn it down is that ok?
and when they ask whats got me going so crazy
i let 'em know it's all about you!

it's all about i wanna dance and sing
all about you everything
all about you our voices ring
everything i do is for you
it's all about you i wanna dance and sing
all about you everything
all about you our voices ring
it's all about you!

i just wanna sing and dance like every day
don't wanna stop turn it down is that ok?
and when they ask whats got me going so crazy
i let 'em know it's all about you!
i just wanna sing and dance like everyday 
don't wanna stop turn it down is that ok?
and when they ask just whats got me going so crazy 
i let 'em know it's all about you!---Lyrics submitted by erin.
