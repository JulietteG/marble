So I got all these things, but so what?
In the end you can't take them with you
You think you can save my soul? Well Ok...
Tell me, with all your conviction
What happens now?

Well I could be boarding an aircraft
With a bomb concealed in somebody's briefcase
And my body will spread through the heavens, across the sky
And my ashes will fall through the cloudburst
What happens now?
What happens now? ---
