A good impression of myself
Not much to conceal
I'm saying nothing
But I'm saying nothing with feel

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining please

Because of who we are
We react in mock surprise
The curse of "there must be more"
So don't breathe here,
Don't leave your bags

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining please

The dust in my soul
Makes me feel the weight in my legs
My head in the clouds
And I'm zoning out

I'm watching TV
But I find it hard to stay conscious
I'm totally bored
But I can't switch off

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV, cod philosophy

We're lost in the mall
Shuffling through the stores like zombies
What is the point?
What can money buy?

My hand's on a gun
And I find the range, God tempt me
What did you say?
Think I'm passing out

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV, cod philosophy

Water so warm that day (water so warm that day)
I counted out the waves (I counted out the waves)
As they broke into shore
I smiled into the sun

The water so warm that day
I was counting out the waves
And I followed their short life
As they broke on the shoreline
I could see you
But I couldn't hear you

You were holding your hat in the breeze
Turning away from me in this moment
You were stolen as black across the sun

Water so warm that day (water so warm that day)
I counted out the waves (I counted out the waves)
As they broke into shore (as they broke into shore)---
