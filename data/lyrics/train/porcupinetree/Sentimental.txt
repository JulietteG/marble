Never want to be old 
And I dont want dependence 
Its no fun to be told 
That you cant blame your parents anymore 

Im finding it hard 
To hang from a star 
Dont want to be 
Never want to be old 

Sullen and bored the kids stay 
And in this way they wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play 
And in this way wish away each day

I dont really know 
If I care what is normal
And I m not really sure 
If the pills Ive been taking are helping

I'm wasting my life
Hurting inside 
I dont really know 
And Im not really sure 

Sullen and bored the kids stay 
And in this way they wish away each day 
Stoned in the mall the kids play 
And in this way wish away each day 

Sullen and bored the kids stay 
And in this way they wish away each day 
Stoned in the mall the kids play 
And in this way wish away each day
