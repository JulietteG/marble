I was born and grow in di ghetto
I want you to know if you should really know
My caretaker could not afford for I to get some education
So i turn to do some cultivation

Yet the pirates them take with all that I cultivate

Them never see when mi use of mi farm
Oh yes them hol' mi machete

The pirates them take with all that I cultivate

Disappointment is my only friend
It never ever leave me
Never any time my friend
Cause mi plant calli herb
If a man come pass right thru'
Mi plant sensimina them come and take it too
Them rob from their mother even them brothers too
Donno what to say
*can ah if a man want to

Herbs pirate them take with all that I cultivate
Herbs pirate *you said yout men if I man straight
Them a DJ pirate them take with all that I cultivate

Seven days a week I've got to work the field
And they know it's the only way i can get my meal
Who cut mi herb? Them bound to steal
It was written in the book if a man
Thou shall not steal

Herbs pirate them take with all that I cultivate
Herbs pirate you said yout men if I man straight
Them a DJ pirate them take with all that I cultivate
