I'll make you suffer alone
And make think it was meant to be
I'll rip apart your soul
And make think it was meant to be

Close, close your eyes
And breathe my lies
Breathe my lies

Collaborating like killers(2x)

All the beauty you'll never see
The things you'll never be
Never be

Collaborating like killers (4x)

All the beauty you'll never see
The things you'll never be---Lyrics submitted by Katie Hanson.
