That was her first time 
That was her last time 

Cut at your face 
Blood in the sink 
You'll hate your-self 
Till the day you die 

Till the day you die 

Blood on your hands 
Blood on your legs 
Why does this happen time and time again? 
Time and time again 

Blood 

I should have sown my heart in my chest 
Are eyes should have never met 
Eyes should have never met 
Never met (2x) 

FINE, FUCK YOU THEN 

Slit wrist savior 
She cuts to see blood 

SHE CUTS TO SEE BLOOD!!!---Lyrics submitted by siena.
