Behind her smile lies rotten teeth
Behind her eyes lie broken memories
Broken Memories
Broken Memories

Like a rose fallen to the floor
This whore digs her own grave
This whore digs her own grave

You built a heart from cinders
You built a heart that only hinders

This is sorrow the sound of breaking glass
My lovers fall at last
My lovers fall at last

Like a rose fallen to the floor
This whore digs her own grave

This is sorrow the sound of breaking glass

CONSUME ME WITH HATE---Lyrics submitted by eric.
