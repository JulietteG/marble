Oh Lover, hold on 
'till I come back again 
For these arms are growin' tired, 
And my tales are wearing thin 

If you're patient I will surprise, 
When you wake up i'll have come 

All the angerwill settle down 
And we'll go do all the things we should have done 

Yes I remember what we said 
As we lay down to bed 
I'll be here if you will only come back home 

Oh lover, i'm lost 
Because the road i've chosen beckens me away 

Oh lover, don't you rome 
Now i'm fighting words I never thought i'd say 

But I remember what we said 
As we lay down to bed 
I'll forgive you oh 
If you just come back home 

Hmmm mmmm 
Hmmmm mmmm 

Oh lover, I'm old 
You'll be out there and be thinking just of me 

And I will find you down the road 
And will return back home to where we're meant to be 

'cause I remember what we said 
As we lay down to bed 
We'll be back soon as we make history.---Lyrics submitted by jade.
