Seventeen and running up the stairs
My baby bear
Seven lonely hours that I've been without a shower until
You and I meet in the bathroom with the water on
Steaming up the room with little but a towel on
You are my heart
And you are my heart, you're the sky

A joint or two, just hanging out the window in September
On the twenty-eighth I'll be thrown inside to clean up my act
Four months in the penitentiary where I can read and think I'll make it home
And you are my heart
And you are my heart, you're the sky
And you are my heart

Everything I said last night when we were in the car
Telling you I knew, I knew, I knew that we would make it far
Everyone in this town will see that someone like you could be with someone like me
Even fairy tale characters would be jealous, even fairy tale characters would be jealous
Even fairy tale characters would be jealous, even fairy tale characters
And you are my heart
And you are my heart, you're the sky
And you are my heart
And you are---Lyrics submitted by Dei.
