I was blown away,
Busy disappearing
'Til I saw your face
In the stratosphere
And now I can't escape,
The force field that we're in
Got me light years away,
So out of space,
Without a trace,

Baby we're gone, baby we're gone,
C'mon,

Ain't no way we're going home,
Let's stay on the run forever,
Let's go nowhere that we know,
Get strange with the stars together,
We can do what you wanna do,
What you wanna do,
Baby, we can do better.
Ain't no way we're going home,
Yeah, so let's go,
Yeah, let's go.

Burning air,
You lit a fire,
Feel like millionaires,
Blacktop to tires
Let's get outta here.
And you make it brighter,
When we can't see the road,
Where does this go?
God only knows.

Baby we're gone, Baby we're gone,
C'mon,

Ain't no way we're going home,
Let's stay on the run forever,
Let's go nowhere that we know,
Get strange with the stars together,
We can do what you wanna do,
What you wanna do,
Baby, we can do better.
Ain't no way we're going home,
Yeah, so let's go,
Yeah, let's go.

I'm a light,
You're the bomb,
We're together!

I'm the pop,
You're the rocks,
We're together!

I'm the write,
You're the song,
We're together!

Yeah, together, yeah.

Light years away,
So outta space,
Without a trace.

Baby we're gone, Baby we're gone,
C'mon.

We can do what you wanna do,
What you wanna do,
Baby, we can do better.
Ain't no way we're going home,
Yeah, so let's go,
Yeah, let's go.

Ain't no way we're going home,
Let's stay on the run forever,
Let's go nowhere that we know,
Get strange with the stars together,
We can do what you wanna do,
What you wanna do,
Baby, we can do better.
Ain't no way we're going home,
Yeah, so let's go,
Yeah, let's go.

Ain't no way we're going home,
Yeah, so let's go,
Yeah, let's go.---Lyrics submitted by Hannah Worley.
