Today I feel like running naked through your street
To get your attention (whoa)
I broke up with my girl so tell me where to meet
Or did I mention (whoa oh oh)

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel all right?
Baby I don't want to see you cry, no
I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

Today I feel like blowing all my cash on you
I'd buy you anything until I'm broke
Today I want to turn your skies from grey to blue
And if it rains on you I'll be your coat (whoa oh oh)

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel all right?
Baby I don't want to see you cry, no
I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

Let me take your picture, baby
I'll save it for a rainy day
I don't need much
I guess I'm just old fashioned in that way
So on the count of three, let's see you

A one... a two... a one, a two... a one, two, three

Smile
I wanna see you smile (oh, oh)
I wanna see you smile
I wanna see you smile

It's the things you do
I wanna make you smile---
