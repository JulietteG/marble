Rock! Rock!
Baby

Rock! Rock!
'Cmon and rock that rock with me
Just in here feeling like a zombie
Rock it up, let's just get it on
We can dance in the streets til midnight
Blood pumping to the beat of this song

We can run through the city and the bright lights
Take a chance living life on loud
Come over here, come over here
You, me, now

We can rock it in the rain
Rock it on the beach
Rock it on the dock
Gonna rock it on repeat
Baby, baby you and me
Woah

We can rock it in the street 
Rock out in the car
We all got the need to scream
Doesn't matter where we are
Baby, baby, young and free
C'mn and rock that rock with me

Rock! Rock!
Baby
Rock! Rock!
Baby
Rock! Rock!
Baby

Rock! Rock!
Cmon and rock that rock with me

Get here! Move a little faster
Can't wait, the night is young
Turn it up, blowing all the speakers
Gonna party til we see the sun

Running crazy through the night
And the city lights
Take a chance living life so loud
Come over here, come over here

Make it pop

We can rock it in the rain
Rock it on the beach
Rock it on the dock
Gonna rock it on repeat
Baby, baby you and me
Woah

We can rock it in the street 
Rock out in the car
We all got the need to scream
Doesn't matter where we are
Baby, baby, young and free
C'mn and rock that rock with me

Rock! Rock!
Baby
Rock! Rock!
Rock it

We can rock it in the rain
Rock it on the beach
Rock it on the dock
Gonna rock it on repeat
Baby, baby you and me
Woah

We can rock it in the street 
Rock out in the car
We all got the need to scream
Doesn't matter where we are
Baby, baby, young and free
C'mn and rock that rock with me

Rock! Rock!
Baby
Rock! Rock!
Baby
Rock! Rock!
Baby

Rock! Rock!
Cmon and rock that rock with me---Lyrics submitted by Malak shehadi.
