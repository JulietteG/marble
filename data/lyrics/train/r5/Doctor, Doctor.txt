I've just come to realize the fire in your eyes for me
And baby all these little sparks ignite until I just can't breathe

And time and time and time and time and time again
I'm lying in the dark, and wondering where you are
I'm tryna, tryna, tryna find the medicine
Straight into my heart, it's tearing me apart

I'm screaming, "Doctor, doctor"
Bottle it up
I'm a believer, believer
This love is a drug
I'm dying, I can't get enough
I'm screaming, "Doctor, doctor"
Bottle it up

I haven't slept a couple nights
Been staring at the ceiling again
The side effect I know too well
I'm addicted to the feeling

And time and time and time and time and time again
I'm living in a dream, or somewhere in between
I'm tryna, tryna, tryna find the medicine
It's everything I need, you're the remedy

I'm screaming, "Doctor, doctor"
Bottle it up
I'm a believer, believer
This love is a drug
I'm dying, I can't get enough
I'm screaming, "Doctor, doctor"
Bottle it up

Doctor, doctor, bottle it up
I'm a believer, believe me, this love is a drug
I'm dying, I can't get enough
Doctor, doctor

I'm screaming, "Doctor, doctor"
Bottle it up
I'm a believer, believer
This love is a drug
I'm dying, I can't get enough
I'm screaming, "Doctor, doctor"
Bottle it up---
