Just being honest, you can't tie me down
Life is a short trip, and I've been around
Oh, Sydney, Ireland, Tokyo, don't tell the man
I swear I didn't know it but she didn't care

So I put your hands where I can see
Make you write this song for me

She's so bad she's good for me
This girls know ways you won't believe
One night is all she needs
Love me, leave me, left me numb
Did you have your fun?

I like the music, and asked her to dance
Said no one leaves 'em, don't tell my friends
Underneath the street lights, there was smoke in the air
She said she's never like this while she's pulling my hair

She said put your hands where I won't see
Baby I won't say a thing
Stop leaving stains of cigarettes
And come put your lips on me

She's so bad she's good for me
This girl knows ways you won't believe
One night is all she needs
Love me, leave me, left me numb
Did you have your fun?

What you running from?
Drop the guns, I'm singing drop the guns
Tell me what is you running from?
Drop the guns, drop the guns?
Drop the guns, baby did you have your fun?

She's so bad she's good for me
This girl knows ways you won't believe
One night is all she needs
Love me, leave me, left me numb
Love me, leave me, left me numb
She's so bad she's good for me
This girls knows ways you won't believe
One night is all she needs
Love me, leave me, left me numb
Did you have your fun?---
