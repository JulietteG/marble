There you are standing with all your friends
So I wait until you're alone again and the minutes feel like eternity
All these words buried inside my heart
Every step feels like the hardest part, but the last 6 feet are gonna kill me

So just take this chance
I've got it all planned

I'll pick you up at 8 and we can drive around
Take you to the beach and we can head downtown while you hold my hand
We'll park it, lay down on the hood of my car
Listen to the airplanes as we count the stars, tonight I'll be your man
And tomorrow we can do it again and tomorrow we can do it again

If I could give you the world tonight
Then I would, I'd still give you all my time
And I'd be rich cause love is everything

So just take this chance
I've got it all planned

I'll pick you up at 8 and we can drive around
Take you to the beach and we can head downtown while you hold my hand
We'll park it, lay down on the hood of my car
Listen to the airplanes as we count the stars, tonight I'll be your man
And tomorrow we can do it again

Let's take this moment, it's ours so own it
So come with me, don't let it go to waste
No you don't wanna let this miss out on us
I'm telling you regrets don't fade away

I'll pick you up at 8 and we can drive around
Take you to the beach and we can head downtown while you hold my hand
We'll park it, lay down on the hood of my car
Listen to the airplanes as we count the stars, tonight I'll be your man
And tomorrow we can do it again
I'll pick you up at 8 and we can drive around
Take you to the beach and we can head downtown while you hold my hand
We'll park it, lay down on the hood of my car
Listen to the airplanes as we count the stars, tonight I'll be your man
I'll give you all I can and tomorrow we can do it again---
