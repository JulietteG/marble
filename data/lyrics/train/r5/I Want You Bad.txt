In the back of a taxi cab, one,
Quick turn you were on my lap, we,
Touched hands and we pulled them back,
Yeah,
I want you bad!

And even though it should be so wrong, I,
Can't help but feel this strong, cuz,
The way you turn me on,
Like a light switch,
I might just go
Crazy
Cuz you're my best friends baby,
But you got me thinking maybe, just maybe,
I don't know what to do!

But I'm in love with,
Someone else's girl you,
Rock my world,
But you're the one that I can't have,
I want you bad!

In my crazy mind,
I'm with you all the time,
Cuz you're the best that I can't have,
O, girl,
I want you bad!

Oh, oh, oh oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh

I want you...
Bad!

It's so hard, just to pretend,
This sucks!
You're his girl and he's my friend, no,
Good way for this to end, yeah,
I want you bad!

I wish someone could help me,
This is just so unhealthy!
And everything you got just kills me,
You're guilty!

Go Crazy
Cuz you're my best friend's baby,
But you got me thinking maybe, just maybe,
I don't know what to do

I'm in love with someone else's girl, you,
Rock my world,
But you're the one that I can't have,
I want you bad!

In my crazy mind,
I'm with you all the time,
You're the one that I can't have,
Oh, girl I want you bad!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh

I want you bad!

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

I want you bad!
(I want you bad!)

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

I want you bad!

Crazy,
Cuz you're my beat friends baby,
But you got me thinking maybe, just maybe,
I don't know what to do!

I'm in love with someone else's girl, you,
Rock my world,
You're the best I never had,
Oh, girl, I want you bad!

In my crazy mind,
I'm with you all the time,
You're the best I never had,
Oh, girl, I want you bad!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh

I want you bad!

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Oh, girl, I want you bad!---Lyrics submitted by lennon nicole herron.
