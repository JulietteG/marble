Something felt so good when you said my name
(I will)
All that I want from you, is to feel the same
(I will)
Stay for the night
I wanna show you what the real you is like (Oh oh ohh)
Turn back the time
I'm only living when you're here in my life
And now you're leaving

My heart's, lonely without you
My eyes, only see you and me
Stupid, thinking about you
It's hard, hard cause you make me feel good
Cause you make me feel good

Maybe this is love or maybe I'm insane
(I will)
Temptations pulling me
And now I can't escape
(I will)
Give me the night
I wanna know what lucky secrets you hide
Lay by my side
I'm only living when you're here in my life (Oh oh ohh)
And now you're leaving

My heart's, lonely without you
My eyes, only see you and me
Stupid, thinking about you
It's hard, hard cause you make me feel good
Cause you make me feel good

F.E.E.L G.O.O.D, yes I feel good sing it with me
F.E.E.L G.O.O.D, yes I feel good sing it with me
F.E.E.L G.O.O.D, yes I feel good sing it with me
F.E.E.L G.O.O.D, yes I feel good sing it with me

My heart's, lonely without you
My eyes, only see you and me
Stupid, thinking about you
It's hard, hard cause you make me feel good
My heart's
(Ooh, good)
Good
(Ohh Darling!)

Feel good
F.E.E.L G.O.O.D
F.E.E.L G.O.O.D (Feel good)
F.E.E.L G.O.O.D
F.E.E.L G.O.O.D (I feel good)
F.E.E.L G.O.O.D
F.E.E.L G.O.O.D
