None of your ponies were ridden in nearly a year
I took one out past the gate where the woods become clear
He took the bit in his mouth wouldn't stop anymore
Galloping crazy and free we went straight for you door

What is it for?
Calling your name
In love with the flame that once burned in your eye
some become wise
And some become fools for the rest of their life

Old Mrs. Brock cooked a dinner and none can compare
Straight to the guest house i ran threw myself down the stairs
You were not there 
Dizzy and crumpled i watch the sun set so serene
I knew that you'd left cause you'd somehow envisioned this scene

What does it mean
Calling your name
In love with the flame that once burned in your eye
Some become wise
And some become fools for the rest of their life

Someone once told me without love it's all a disguise
Go out get dressed up embellish each of your lies
How I despise it

Calling your name
In love with the flame that once burned in your eye
Some become wise
And some become fools for the rest of their life---Lyrics submitted by amber blase.
