Believe in memories to resurrect me

Besieged by falling dreams
Hold them tightly
Adorn my wings to thee, and use them nightly

I'm neither angel nor a demon spawn
Though some will call me god
Gravity is just a law I've wrought

Hear temptation take the sky for all to see
Sheer elation to write in history

I'm neither angel nor a demon spawn
Though some will call me god
Gravity is just a feeble plot

When I said I'd never kneel again
What I really meant
Was (fucking) pull the pin because time is spent

Unite with ravens on their shadow flights
As my nocturnal right
Gravity is just a mortal's vice

When I said I'd never feel or see
Love and sight are last resorts for me---Lyrics submitted by Trey.
