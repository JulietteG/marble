In sunshine's view
The absence of love
Behold what's blinding you
Serpent or dove
Between uncertainty
Tethered wings and captive dreams aren't worth the suffering

Open your eyes
Devotion deprived
Deny the very thing that accepted this life is about
Listen to words
Defy devotion
Sick from the fall behind the wall
I demand of you stand up and see

Before they saw what I was becoming
Before it kept me form reaching...

The light
Can't seem to understand it
Can't seem to know
Listen to the vacant soul
The child has lost his way

Tension
Suffering the hole
Something against me
I won't try
Never again
I will not remember
Between the lines I sing with doubt
Behind this will fall

Lost in night and day
Breathing for me
Listen to the way I enter the world
In time this lie will become me

The things I've done to forget my dying senses
Weary from this act alone
In vein six days away
Return from the fall

Just find a ray of light to help me ascend
That is the only way---Lyrics submitted by Trey.
