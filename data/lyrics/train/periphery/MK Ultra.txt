Innocent babe, shall we corrupt at such a young age.
Conjure a laugh, conjure the tears amongst love.
Glass brain, it will project all of the spectrum.
Heart still, but his infant hands are shaking now.

Start leaking all the thoughts on your mind.
What's yours, is ours for the taking.
Take this bruise as a sign that we own you now and forevermore.

Spiral down.
Disconnecting sight from sound.
Control one.

Innocent babe, shall we corrupt at such a young age.
Conjure a laugh, conjure the tears amongst love.
Glass brain, it will project all of the spectrum.
Heart still, but his infant hands are shaking now.

The poison now is your responsibility.
You can finger-paint with blood on your hands.

Take this bruise as a sign that we own you now and forevermore.---
