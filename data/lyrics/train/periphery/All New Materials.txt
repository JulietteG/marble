Moments lost searching for a dream that's real
From my heart
I'd give it all away just to know

Holding with every answer sealed.
The path is hollowed, immortality we seek.
Light streaming from below, this life is reborn.

Drifting away
In truth revealed
With perfect order life repeating endlessly
Light streaming from below
This is life reborn

From the shadow to the light
Moving through the time
It's a cycle that repeats

Now
Forever
Don't touch the spinning wheel
Risking progression just for a little taste
But it's so natural
Call it human if you wish to save face
Losing control
Go with the flow
Get swept in the undertow

Where do we go
You ask in simple question
Let me show you
Give me your hand and we shall fly

Seeing all from infant eyes
Moving all through me
It's a cycle that repeats

Into better days from dreams---Lyrics submitted by Trey.
