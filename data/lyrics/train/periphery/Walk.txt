Reach into the void
Touch the heart of darkness
Reach for the light
Feel the hand of god

The uncertainty of my existence
Can be decided by choice of a path I must walk
So, sick monotone culprit
Come on down and we'll talk about it

Bow down to the gods
Or keep on walking further.
On the cusp of our enlightenment we march

With the sun at my back
I take my first step outside shading my thoughts
and perceptions.
Done from the truth I'll never run
Be it the light or the shadow
I walk in hand with all

Born of nothing
My thoughts are unconditional
And I despise the faade of the original martyr
Deep with the void

Higher
Searching for the light
We leave this world behind

The violent twisting of the fates
The eminent collapse of our current state

Born of nothing
My thoughts are unconditional
And I despise the faade of the original martyr
Deep with the void

Higher
Searching for the light
We leave this world behind

Bow down to the gods
Or keep on walking further.
On the cusp of our enlightenment we march---Lyrics submitted by Trey.
