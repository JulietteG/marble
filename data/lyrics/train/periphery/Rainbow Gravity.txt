Further down this road.
Where is it that we are leading the generation we know?
The answer lie down inside the mind of humanity.
It's a vast, dark sea.

Will we fall forever alone, down in this unknown abyss?
Where we fail is thinking our worth is something much more than this.

Hold your breath.
We're sinking down for miles in an ocean full or mortal mistake, where the light is much clearer.
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down.

The walls are closing in.
We're cluttering.
All that is meant for us is lost.
Bite your tongue.
Can we search a little deeper for what our actions will cost?

Will we fall forever alone, down in this unknown abyss?
Where we fail is thinking our worth is something much more than this.

Hold your breath.
We're sinking down for miles in an ocean full or mortal mistake, where the light is much clearer.
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down.

We set our feeble minds on the bullshit.
Will we ever escape from where the light is much clearer?
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down.

Can't we find a place where we finally can think for ourselves?
Our thoughts are unspoken.
We can fly, yes, we can soar.
Staring in the face what we choose to accept, but can't ignore.
Our thoughts are unspoken.
Life is knocking at your door.
This is a calling to the human race.
We are alone the more we segregate.
And I won't be part of this in the end.

Hold your breath.
We're sinking down for miles in an ocean full or mortal mistake, where the light is much clearer.
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down.

We set our feeble minds on the bullshit.
Will we ever escape from where the light is much clearer?
Is it time to purge our lungs amongst the shipwreck?
Further we lower us down.---
