Flashing eyes of heat
Vessel through the deep
By the son of night, unclean.

Charon

Fear becomes belief,
For those who cannot pay the fee.
A coin to board the fleet,
Or one hundred years disease

Row

But the line it never fades
The story is bound to unfold in the end

Love of mine, gone forever
Say goodbye to the sky
Bound by time, enter the ride
Absently, I will be

Motivate fortune
Can't escape from the arms of death

Along the shore many faces accumulate
In preparation for the underworld
Single file ghost by ghost
The deck fills up to embark on the final sail

But the line it never fades
The story is bound to unfold in the end

Alone we rise and fall
Awaiting the day, a life coalesced.
Deep in the silence our fate is won
Create and consciously free the mind.
So far from where I lost my soul,
Depart, implore, divine.

In our minds adventure is always listening
Just stay here
The world isn't always listening
Disappear

Suffer in endless doubt
Holding onto the memories as they fade away.
These thoughts and sorrows will not remain.---Lyrics submitted by Trey.
