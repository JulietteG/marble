He saw the best in me
When everyone else around
Could only see the worst in me

Can I tell yall one more time, one more time?

I said he saw the best in me
When everyone else around
Could only see the worst in me
I wish I had a witness tonigth
All I need is one
Heyyy

He saw the best in me
(When everyone else around me)
When everyone else around (oohh)
(Could only see))
Could only see the worst in me

Does anybody have that testimony?
When folk walks you off
Said you would never make it, what did he see?

He saw the best in me
(When everyone else around you yeaa)
When everyone else around
(Ooohh, could only)
Could only see the worst in me

Can I tell yall one more thing?
I just need to tell you one more thing

(Listen to this)

See hes mine, and I am his
It doesnt matter what I did
He only sees me, for who I am
Does anybody know that today?
Oh Ohh

See hes mine, and I am his
It doesnt matter what I did
He only sees me, for who I am
Does anybody know that today?
(Help me sing it)

Said that he is mine
See hes mine
Im his
And I am his
It doesnt matter what I did
It doesnt matter what I did
Cause he only sees me for who I am, yea.. yea..
He only sees me for who I am---Lyrics submitted by Charles.
