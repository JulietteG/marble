I've had my share of ups and downs.Times where there was no one around.God came and spoke these words to me.Praise will confuse the enemy.
(repeat)

So i started singing,i started clapping,i started dancing,people were laughing.They knew my problems,they knew my pain.But i knew God would take them away.ooooh oo ooooh oh oooh oh oooooh

That's y i praise him with my hands,that's y i praise him with a dance. He's given me a second chance. Come on lets praise him in advance. That's y i praise him with a song,when things are right and when they're wrong. He's given me a second chance. Come on let's praise him in advance.

(Praise him x6)Come on and praise him in advance
