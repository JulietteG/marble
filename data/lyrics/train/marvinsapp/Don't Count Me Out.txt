[Solo:]
Left alone but never forgotten
Misunderstood,
But my future is just starting,
GOD is molding me and shaping me,
He's building me and making me,
A king is being formed right in front of your eyes
So don't count me out

[Chorus:]
So don't count me out
When you don't see what HE sees
You can't tell but HIS glory is resting on me
I'm HIS choice
after HIS heart
The unveiling is starting now
So don't count me out

[Unison]
Left alone but never forgotten
Misunderstood,
But my future is just starting
GOD is molding me and making me
He's building me and shaping me
A king is being formed right right front of your eyes

[Marvin Sapp]
So don't count me out

[Chorus:]
So don't count me out
When you don't see what He sees
You can't tell but HIS glory is resting on me
I'm HIS choice
after HIS heart
The unveiling is starting now
So don't count me out

I'm no longer the same no more 
(don't count me out)
There has been a change in me 
[out]
For there are enemies 
that I must defeat
It's my time
It's my time
Don't count me out
Don't count me out

[Solo:]
There's a king in me
Goliaths' to defeat
Visions to decree
It's my destiny
[x3]

[Vamp:]
There's a king in me 
Goliaths' to defeat 
(don't count me out)
Visions to decree
It's my destiny 
(don't count me out)
[x6]

[Solo:]
There's a king in me
Goliaths' to defeat
Visions to decree
It's my destiny
[x3]
