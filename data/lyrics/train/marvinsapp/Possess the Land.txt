Verse One:
(Lead)
There are some things that God
Has promised to the saints
An inheritance for those
Who run and do not faint (oohh ooohh oh)
(Chior repeats 1x)

Chorus:
Stand in authority
Walk in your victory
Rejoice the time is at hand
Go in, possess the land!

Verse Two:
(Chior Included)
The time is neigh that we may hang on by the waist
Take back what they devil stole
Take back what Jesus gave!
