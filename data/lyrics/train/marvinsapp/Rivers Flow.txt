I believe Ill take a drink
From the well that wont run dry
I believe Ill take a drink from a well that giveth life
Thou only knew the gifts of god and who it was that said to thee
Thou would have asked of him give me drink and ye would give unto thee

Ive got a river flowing
Inside of me
Ill take a drink whenever 
I feel the need

Not in the mountains 
Or at Jacobs well 
But from my belly 
Flows a well thats springing of living water 
Worship in me

I will never thirst again
Everlasting life

Water is spirit in me
Worship in life 
The hour has come
And it is now
Spirit and truth
Worship he seeks
Father is seeking someone right now that will let go
And just release

As the waters flow
From the rivers 
To the oceans 
To the seas
Lord your spirit
Flowing inside of me
So as we worship
Let the rivers flow
In this place where we give you our hearts
Give you our hearts

Ive got a well thats living
Inside of me
Life in the flow of worship 
Ill take a drink 

I know your singing, worship
I give you drink
Ive got a well of worship
Inside of me 

Flow, flow, worship inside of me

Life, life, life flowing out of me

Flow, Life, Flow, Life

Life flowing out of me

Flow, Life, Flow, Life

Life flowing out of me---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
