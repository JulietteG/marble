I've had my share of tears
times when I wanted to give in
seems like the day the day would never calm
but i had to encourage me
and find the strength to believe that i (I am an over-comer)
OH (i know i can conquer anything)
With Jesus (With Jesus I am an over comer)
I am an I win (I can win, I can win)

(oh oh oh oh)
You say its just to hard
and youve lost your confidence in God
You see you let circumstances (control oh) control
But if you just believe (i can)
You can do anything
you can say to yourself (i am an over-comer)
you know that I (i know i can conquer anything)
with Jesus (with Jesus i am an over-comer) I am
I'm an over-comer I win (i can win, i can win)
I win

(oh oh oh oh)
in every adversity you should stand strong
(oh oh oh oh)
and claim victories all the way
(oh oh oh oh)
Because out of your obstacles
(oh oh oh oh)
Gods working miracles
(oh oh oh oh)
Youll see it accomplished in every experience

Say i decree it and i declare
I know that i shall win
all you gotta say is this (i decree it, declare)
say i decree it and i declare it (i shall win)
I shall win everybody help me say

(i decree it, declare) i shall win
(i shall win)
i decree it and i declare it (i decree it, declare)
that i shall win (i shall win)

say yes (yes) i shall win (i win)
yes (yes) I shall win (I win)
say yes (yes) I shall win (I win)
say yes (I win) I win (I win)
say yes (yes) I shall win (I win)
say yes (yes) I (I win)
say i win I win (yes)
in every situation (yes, i win),
in every circumstance (I win), in every struggle
I WIN (I win) I yes (yes)
I win (I win) say yes (yes) I win (I win)
(yes, I shall win)
in spite of the circumstance (I shall win)
in spite of every struggle and trial (I shall win)
I shall win (I shall win)

I wonder is there anybody in here that can help me
say yes(yes)I win (I win)
say yes (yes) I win (I win)
say yes (yes) I win (I win)
I win (I win) I win (I win)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
