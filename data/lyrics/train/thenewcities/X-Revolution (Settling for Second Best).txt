It's all overrated
we're all dazed and jaded

we never give a damn if you're on your side
it doesn't make it better but if sure feels right
do you believe, do you believe me

we never pay the price but commit the crime
you wanna get it fast but you got no time
do you believe, do you believe me

now can you blame the kids for trying to aim
for fated future to change whatever your reaction

look out for clues this is the path that we choose
this is our moment of truth alive and in full action

It's all overrated 
we're all dazed and jaded
It's an illusion, X revolution
(it's) not what we awaited
we all feel sedated
sick evolution, it's an intrusion

we can see clearly but we don't look twice
your arms get stronger but your bravery's gone
do you believe, do you believe me

sick of being stuck in a twilight zone
who you gonna trust when your faith is gone
will you believe, will you believe me

is this what were supposed to be?
a simple minded tragedy
taking more and giving less
settling for second best

remember when you once believed
in endless possibilities
those days when you could do no wrong
I wonder if those days are gone

it's all overrated
is this what were supposed to be?
we're all dazed and jaded
a simple minded tragedy
(it's) not what we awaited
taking more and giving less
we all feel sedated
settling for second best---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
