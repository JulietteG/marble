Once it starts it's coming down but I don't want to be around
won't you come and go away with me?
once you start to realize no one's waiting by your side
I'll watch you slowly fall apart

nobody knows just what to call me
I'm at a low I'm living in a dream
nobody knows if angels are calling
as you try to stay right here with my fears
and I know you won't be leaving
but all my thoughts are half the world away

flash a smile when you say that there will be a better day
won't you come and go away with me?
broken mirror in front of me distorted views are all I see
watch me as I fall apart

I know you like the way you look tonight
you said I've read you like a book you're right
I know you like the way you look tonight 
you said I've read you like a book you're right---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
