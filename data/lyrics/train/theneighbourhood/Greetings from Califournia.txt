Hands up it's a stick up
Nobody's leaving this room for a minute
Everyone's breathing these fumes
That are in it
Sick of the people who make the decisions

Put your hands up it's a stick up
Hopefully God is still down to forgive us
Nobody's breathing
Who let the evil in?

What's in the water?
Are you bothered?
What's the problem here?

I can feel it go down
I can feel it go down all the way
All the way
Give it to me slow now
Give it to me slow then watch the way
It comes and comes

Handcuffed and I thought of you
I made love and I thought of you
My Daddy died, I just thought of you
My Sister cried and my Mama too
I got a place and I thought of you
I tried to decorate and I thought of you
I'm seeing red but I'm singing blue
I never knew what black and white would bring you too

Anybody, somebody, please
I'm begging
I'm even on my knees
I've got a dozen insecurities
But I don't think you should be worried for me
No I don't think you should be worried for me---
