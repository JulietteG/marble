Vacancy was hit
The guests were checkin' in
The concierge was cold
The water pipes had mold all over them 
The room was fit for two
The bed was left to ruins
The neighbour was knocking, yeah
But no one would let him in

Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathin'
feel like I am human

I'm dancin' through the night,
of vodka and sprite
A glimpse of your silhouette 
A light they they'd never forget

Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathin'
feel like I am human [2x] 

Sweet sought death 
on a queen sized bed
and you had said
"darling your looks can kill"
so now you're dead 

Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathin'
feel like I am human (again) [2x]---Lyrics submitted by Jillian Starkey.
