[Verse 1]
Cause every single time I,
look into the past I, 
think of what we had and it blows my mind.
And I just wanna symbolize,
how fast time can fly.

[Chorus] 
Don't tell us where to go.
Don't tell us to lie low,
let us move to the tides.
It's the start of something new,
looking back on what we knew,
we were so confined.

Sha na na naa.
Sha na na naa.
Cause every other line's an exaggeration,
she always makes the best of a situation.
(X2)

[Verse 2]
Living life day by day,
never time to delay,
just wanna go out and not have to worry what to say.
And now it's time to say goodbye,
to wondering why.

[Chorus]
Don't tell us where to go.
Don't tell us to lie low,
let us move to the tides.
It's the start of something new,
looking back on what we knew,
now it's time to unwind.

Sha na na naa.
Sha na na naa.
Cause every other line's an exaggeration,
she always makes the best of a situation.
(X2)

[Bridge]
Now every single time I try to get away,
It ends up being my dismay.
No, it's not okay.

[Chorus] 

Sha na na naa.
Sha na na naa.
Cause every other line's an exaggeration, 
she always makes the best of a situation.
