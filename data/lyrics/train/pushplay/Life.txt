They say we're wasting time walking 
like we're blind Our look trying to 
find the reason why Our lines are so 
Unpredictable My life is not for sale
This one never fails Not this time I won't 
Fail This is our one shot To break free 
from this lie

This is the life This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute Every second 
is so real

Now we're on the road Playing 
sold out shows And now they 
don't know Who we are tonight
The crowd screams for one more

This is the life This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute Every second 
is so real

This is the life This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute Every second 
is so real

This is the life This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute Every second 
is so real

This is the life This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute Every second 
is so real

This is the life This is the dream
And it's nothing as it seems
Every minute Every second 
is so real---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
