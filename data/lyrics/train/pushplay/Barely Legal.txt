Officer there seems to be an issue the girl who
broke my heart broke me the worst news
our dreams of growing up are blowing up she 
showed me up but now I'm stuck on her just like
a tattoo (like a tattoo)

One more day, face to face and I could say
You got me crossed at eighteen
I'm barely legal and I can't believe
You went away and now I'm begging you to stay
Fingers crossed, suddenly
I can barely find the room to breathe

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
I want you, I want you to want me x2
From the heart of the city, to the tip of Japan
Experience the romance only found in France

Your dreams have given up
The door is shut
I'm not good enough
And now I'm lost in a city without a plan

One more day, face to face and I could say
You got me crossed at eighteen
You went away and now I'm begging you to stay
Fingers crossed, suddenly
I can barely find the room to breathe

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
I want you, I want you to want me

One more day, face to face and I could say (say)
You got me crossed at eighteen
I'm barely legal and I can't believe
You went away and now I'm begging you to stay
Fingers crossed, suddenly
I can barely find the room to breathe

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
I want you, I want you to want me

You got me crossed at eighteen
I'm barely legal and I can't believe
You went away and now I'm begging you to stay
Fingers crossed, suddenly
I can barely find the room to breathe

Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
I want you, I want you to want me!---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
