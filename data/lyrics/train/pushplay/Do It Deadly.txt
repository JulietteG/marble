Another day Another mistake
Waiting by the phone for hours
Not one call Not even a heads up
Excuses that you make are so fake
Never in my life have I met a girl 
like you Hopefully I'll never have to

Yeah girl you played the game but I can 
keep it lasting I will keep you begging 
just say please Your crying on your knees
Girl you played the game You played it good
But I control you can't you see your lying 
through your teeth

Another day Another game played
Whats your score now too high to count
Do whats right Or you'll get arrested
Everything about you is so infested
Never in my life have I met a girl like you
Hopefully I'll never have to

Yeah girl you played the game but I can 
keep it lasting I will keep you begging 
just say please Your crying on your knees
Girl you played the game You played it good
But I control you can't you see your lying 
through your teeth

Yeah girl you played the game but I can 
keep it lasting I will keep you begging 
just say please Your crying on your knees
Girl you played the game You played it good
But I control you can't you cant you see

Yeah girl you played the game but I can 
keep it lasting I will keep you begging 
just say please Your crying on your knees
Girl you played the game 

Yeah girl you played the game but I can 
keep it lasting I will keep you begging 
just say please Your crying on your knees
Girl you played the game You played it good
But I control you can't you cant you see---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
