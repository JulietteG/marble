Look a little bit closer
Look a little bit closer at me now
Look how much I've changed
And threw all my bad habits away

Position changed I'm ready
for the next round Away away 
Away You took my breath away
Just to spit it out

I promise you won't regret won't regret 
that you took me back this time
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)
'Cause things are moving so fast
I don't think this'll last the rest of our lives

Position changed I'm ready for the next round!
Away away away I took your breath away
Just to spit it out

Away away away The time will take away all
your hopes and doubts Hey now, look out
Well these things will happen for a reason
Hey now, look out Something's got to break now
Hey now, look out (Whoa oh whoa)

Hey now, look away away away
I take your breath away Just to 
spit it out, out, out, out, out! (yeah)

Away away away
I took your breath away
Just to spit it out
Whoa oh whoa (spit it out!)

Away away away 
I took your breath away 
Just to spit it out
Let's go!
Away away away
Look a little bit closer
Look a little bit closer 
at me now---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
