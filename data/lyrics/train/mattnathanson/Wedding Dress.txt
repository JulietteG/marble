So we lie here in the dark
With all the wrong things on fire
In sickness and in health
To be with you, just to be with you

And in your wedding dress
To have and to hold
'Cause even at my best
I wanna let go

And you hold me in your arms
And all that I can feel
Is my future in your hands
And all that I can see
Is how long ever after is
It's all that I can do
To be with you, just to be with you

Cause in your wedding dress
To have and to hold
'Cause even at my best
I wanna let go

I thought I'd lost you
I thought I'd lost you
I gave you away
Thought I'd lost you
I'm jealous of the moon
For how it moves the waves

'Cause in your wedding dress
To have and to hold
'Cause even at my best
I wanna let go

And I wanna be somebody else now
And I wanna thicken my skin
And I wanna wish it all
Just wish it all away again
Again---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
