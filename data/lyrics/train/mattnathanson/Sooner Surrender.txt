In the party love,
Some band's playing hallelujah
Hallelujah
In the corner love
All night girls drink wine and try to sing along
I made a mess of things
The stops and in betweens
They weigh me down
You got someone new singing you your songs now

Sooner surrender
Then watch the last wall collapse
And sooner surrender
And our love will count for everything

In my sweetest dreams
It's just you and me
And we break wide
I wake reminded love
How I just gave up
And how you moved on, how you moved on

I'm waiting for something
I've waited for now
For the rolling canyons of love
And i'm tongue tied
And you're coming alive, coming alive

Sooner surrender
Then watch the last wall collapse
And sooner surrender
And our love will count for everything

I'm sorry that you've gone
So sorry that you've gone
I'm sorry that you've gone
Love
I'm sorry that you've gone
So sorry that you've gone away
You're a little bit right
More than a little bit right
With my arms around you

Sooner surrender
Then watch the last wall collapse
And sooner surrender
And our love will count for everything

Sooner surrender
Than watch the last wall collapse I know
Sooner surrender and our love will count for everything
Our love will count for everything
And I miss when you were everything---Lyrics submitted by DARLA.
