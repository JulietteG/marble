I remember hearts that beat
Yeah.. Yeah..
I remember you and me
Yeah.. Oh Yeah..
Tangled in hotel sheets..
You wore me out,
You wore me out..
I remember honey lips,
And words so true.
I remember not-stop earthquake dreams of you,
Comin' on fast like good dreams do..
All night long..

Still can feel you kiss me, love..
Still can see your brown skin shine.. shine.. 
Still can feel you kiss me, love..
Come on and drive me wild.. me wild..

And you move like water, yeah.. 
And you broke like waves..
I've Never been deeper.. so far gone,
Your sister in the next room with the television on..

Still can feel you kiss me, love..
Still can see your brown skin shine.. shine..
Still can feel you kiss me, love..
Come on and drive me wild, 
Come on and drive me wild,
Come on and drive me wild...

(Yeah Ooo)

I remember hearts that beat, Yeah
I remember you and me..
Tangled in hotel sheets (Whisper: for hours)

Still can feel you kiss me, love..
Still can see your brown skin shine..shine..
Still can feel you kiss me, love..
come on and drive me wild..
Still can feel you kiss me, love..
Still can see your eyes like diamonds.. diamonds..
Memories are strong enough..
Come on and drive me wild,
Come on and drive me wild..---Lyrics submitted by Josie.
