Don't call it off, don't say it's over now
Cuz I call the shots, and when I say it's off, it's off
And don't call it off, and don't say what you think you have to say to me
What's done is done and I think we both agree that we've run this into the 

ground

And I think it's time we say good night
I think it's time we say goodbye.

Does she know just how to whisper in your ear the way I do?
Does she catch your eyes from a distance standing in a crowded room?
How many times must I sing my soul to you?... my soul to you
Before you realize the trials you put me through?
No one has to know

Won't you grant me this last request?
I just want to feel like I've had something to say in this relationship
And it's been so rough, trying to see eye to eye
And it's been so tough, but at least I tried
And I've had enough, so let me scream it out with my last breath.
I think... it's time.

Does she know just how to whisper in your ear the way I do?
Does she catch your eyes from a distance standing in a crowded room?
How many times must I sing my soul to you?... my soul to you
Before you realize the trials you put me through?
No one has to know... no...
No one... no... no... no... no... 

Too many dreams have come to life to just to wither and die
Keep it a secret, save your pride, I hope she eats you alive
Cuz your faithless words of blasphemy won't get you anywhere with me
Just keep it a secret, save your pride, I hope she eats you alive.

How many times must I sing my soul to you?
Before you realize the trials you put me through?
No one has to know.. no one.. no one... no one...

One more time no...

No, no, no has to know....
No, no, no has to know....
No, no, no has to know....
No, no, no has to know....---Lyrics submitted by Oswaldo.
