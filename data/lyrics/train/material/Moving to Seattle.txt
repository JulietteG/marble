I can smell it on the pavement... it's about to rain
And you can feed me all the pills you want, but you cannot stop the pain.

Am I forcing my hand to write this down?
Today is the day that I finally realized That I can't rely on anyone except myself

So you think you understand me, you're so anxious to evaluate
Maybe I'm well, maybe I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine... maybe I'm in love...

Am I forcing my hand to write this down?
Today is the day that I finally realized That I can't rely on anyone except myself

Don't just stand there, it's about to rain
You were never one to worry.
Maybe my dreams are just more interesting than my reality
All this time... See it through my eyes

Am I forcing my hand?... Am I forcing my hand?---Lyrics submitted by Oswaldo.
