Sitting here wide awake
Thinking about when I last saw you
No youre not far away
Close my eyes and I still see you
Lying here next to me
Wearing nothing but a smile

Gotta leave right away
Counting cracks along the pavement
To see you face to face
Thinking about the conversation
I know Im not one to chase
Ive never wanted nothing more
As I walk up to your door

Standing in the dark
Shes dancing on the table
Im looking through the glass
Shes someone elses angel
It may sound stupid that I wanted you back
But I wanted you back, girl
And now Im standing in the dark, dark, oh
Dark, dark, oh
Dark, dark, oh
Dark, dark, ohh, oohh

All I want to do is hide
But I cant stop myself from staring
Wishing his hands were mine
I cant stop myself from caring
And as he turns down the lights
Im feeling paralysed
And as he looks into her eyes
Oohh, yeah, alright

Standing in the dark
Shes dancing on the table
Im looking through the glass
Shes someone elses angel
It may sound stupid that I wanted you back
But I wanted you back, girl
And now Im standing in the dark, dark, oh
Dark, dark, oh
Dark, dark, ohh, oohh

And now Im standing in the dark, dark---Lyrics submitted by Rosie Ingham.
