People stop to turn and stare
Everywhere she goes
Dollar signs and crimson hair
She will steal your soul
Set her sights on billionaires
All she wants is gold
She is straight up rock and roll
I'm telling you she knows

She know oh oh oh ee oh oh [x2]

Nobody does it like Juliet
Juliet, what you do to me
The way she does it is criminal
Physical and it's killing me
Nothing wrong in these allegations
She know oh oh oh ee oh oh
Nobody does it like Juliet
Juliet, you are haunting me

Pulls you with her perfect smile
Pretty soon you're done
One more sucker pays the price
Thinking you're the one
Many men have tried and failed
Captured by her bold
Stay away from Juliet
You will lose control

She know oh oh oh ee oh oh [x2]

Nobody does it like Juliet
Juliet, what you do to me
The way she does it is criminal
Physical and it's killing me
Nothing wrong in these allegations
She know oh oh oh ee oh oh
Nobody does it like Juliet
Juliet, you are haunting me

She know oh oh oh ee oh oh [x4]
1 2 3 4

Nobody does it like Juliet
Juliet, what you do to me
The way she does it is criminal
Physical and it's killing me
Nothing wrong in these allegations
She know oh oh oh ee oh oh
Nobody does it like Juliet
Juliet, you are haunting me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
