I found a love that's true 
heres what i want you to do
mother, mother, wish me good luck
do you remember the boy, back home
all her ever did, was make me moan
but i found a love thats true
heres what i want you to do
mother, oh mother, mother
wish me good luck
remember the nights
remember the days
i cried 'cuz he lied
and tore out my heart, bit by bit
oh what an aching inside
i found a new guy
he's so sweet to me
and once more im going to repeat
i found a love thats true
heres what i what you do 
mother, oh mother, mother, dear mother
mother oh mother
wish me good luck.---Lyrics submitted by niamh fleming.
