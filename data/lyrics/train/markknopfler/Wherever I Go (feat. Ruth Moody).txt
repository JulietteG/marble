Maybe Im bound to wander
From one place to the next
Heaven knows why
But in the wild blue yonder
Your star is fixed in my sky

Just another bar at a crossroads
So far from home
But thats alright
Whenever Im going down a dark road
I dont feel alone in the night

Theres a place in my heart
Though were far apart
May you always know
No matter how long since I saw you
Ill keep a flame there for you
Wherever I go

Theyre looking to close up in here
Theyre pulling down the blinds
But theyll let you stay awhile
Theyre not going to mind

Now Ive got to leave you, brother
So this rounds mine
Heres looking at you, anyhow
You can go on and have another
They wont call time
Im going to say my goodbyes now

Theres a place in my heart
Though were far apart
May you always know
No matter how long since I saw you
Ill keep a flame there for you
Wherever I go---
