Hunted down I came upon 
A place of ferns and grass 
Gathered to a redbud tree 
And now their footsteps pass 
Where I crouch in dread 
Discovery my certain death 
Bur leaves reaching for my head 
As i suspend my breath 

Redbud tree shelter me shelter me 
Redbud tree shelter me shelter me 

Those days of fear are gone 
Yet i am pledged to her 
As to my only one 
My lovely protector 

Redbud tree shelter me shelter me 
Redbud tree shelter me shelter me 
Redbud tree shelter me shelter me 
Redbud tree shelter me shelter me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
