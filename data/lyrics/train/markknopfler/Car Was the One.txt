In summer '63
I was staying alive
Hanging at the races
Open to drive
When they were done with the weekend
Loading the cars
I couldn't get a pass
So I went to the bar

I'm up in the corner
Nursing a beer
Who should come and laughing
And joking in here
But Bobby Brown, the winner
Of a sports car race
With some friends and a girl
Man, she lit up the place

Bobby was a wild boy
One summer
He knocked down a motel wall
with a hammer
He'd do anything
One night for a bet
He raced through the cornfields
In a Corvette

I thought it's gotta be a thrill
To be like that
With the beautiful girl
And be king of the track
But the truth is where all was said and done
It was his Cobra I wanted
The car was the one
It was his Cobra I wanted
The car was the one

The car was the one
The car was the one---Lyrics submitted by Raymond.
