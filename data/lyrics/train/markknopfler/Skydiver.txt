Ive been banned from every racecourse in the country
Theres something about the unsure thing
Like scoring with a beauty of the county
It always makes the old bell ring

I like to go for broke and Ill be randy
Its got to be the unsure thing
In the Bentley Continental with the brandy
It always makes the old bell ring

And when its gone, all gone
Ill stand on a hilltop and sing
I go where I want, I do what I want
And I dont give a damn about a thing

Today I lost a packet at Wincanton
Dive Bomber in the 2.15
All on the nose and no-one counting
Nothing wishy-washy in between

Back when I made the pivotal decision
To take a winding road that I could see
It was just like being given an incredible permission
The rules dont apply to me

And when its gone, all gone
Ill stand on a hilltop and sing
I go where I want, I do what I want
And I dont give a damn about a thing

Skydiver

Im not being brave, its my money, not my life
When I need to take a break from the brushes and the knife
And I always took a fancy to the ones
Heading straight into the teeth of the guns
