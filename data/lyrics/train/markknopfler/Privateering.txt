Yon's my Privateer 
see how trim she lies 
To every man a lucky hand 
and to every man a prize 
I live to ride the Ocean 
the mighty world around 
To take a little plunder 
and to hear the cannon sound 

To lay with pretty women 
to drink Madeira wine 
to hear the roller's thunder 
on a shore that isn't mine 
Privateering, we will go 
Privateering, Yoh! oh! ho! 
Privateering, we will go 
Yeah! oh! oh! ho! 

The people on your Man 'o war 
are treated worse than scum 
I'm no flogging Captain 
my God I've sailed with some 
Come with me to Barbary 
We'll ply there up and down 
Not quite exactly 
in the service of the Crown 

To lay with pretty women 
to drink Madeira wine 
to hear the roller's thunder 
on a shore that isn't mine 
Privateering, we will go 
Privateering, Yoh! oh! ho! 
Privateering, we will go 
Yeah! oh! oh! ho! 

Look here there's my Privateer 
she's small but she can sting 
Licensed to take prizes 
with a letter from the King 
I love the streets and taverns 
of a pretty foreign town 
tip my hat to the dark eyed ladies 
as we sally up and down 

To lay with pretty women 
to drink Madeira wine 
to hear the roller's thunder 
on a shore that isn't mine 
Privateering, we will go 
Privateering, Yoh! oh! ho! 
Privateering, we will go 
Yeah! oh! oh! ho! 

Britannia needs her Privateers 
each time she goes to war 
death to all her enemies 
No prizes matter more 
Come with me to Barbary 
We'll ply there up and down 
Not quite exactly 
in the service of the Crown 

I lay with pretty women 
to drink Madeira wine 
to hear the roller's thunder 
on a shore that isn't mine 
Privateering, we will go 
Privateering, Yoh! oh! ho! 
Privateering, we will go 
Yeah! oh! oh! ho!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
