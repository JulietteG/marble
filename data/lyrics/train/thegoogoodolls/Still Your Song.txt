Called you up 10 years too late
Just to hear your voice again
I know your voice is still the same
I know that something's changed

My words are choked and full of tears
But still you listen to me dear
And someone's  calling you away
and now I understand

The time that I've wasted
So bitter and faithless
Is wearing me down now.. down now

So Can you hear me?
And would you sing along?
Or Turn me down? 
Forget I ever wrote this for you
So Can you hear me
And has it been too long
and know that I was wrong
and this is still your song

Turn it on and off again
And now I lost another friend
Who waited through my darkest thoughts
When I would surely drown

Now I pass you on my way
And if you stop, what could I say?
Apologies for yesterday
Like a fool, I walk away

The time that I've wasted
So bitter and faithless
Is wearing me down now.. down now

So Can you hear me?
And would you sing along?
Or Turn me down? 
Forget I ever wrote this for you
So Can you hear me
And has it been too long
and know that I was wrong
But this is still your song

And all I understand
We're here and gone again
Moving through a thousand sleepless nights
I fill the page with my beliefs
It's all I have to keep
Tear it up and start again

So Can you hear me?
And would you sing along?
Or Turn me down? 
Forget I ever wrote this for you
Can you hear me?
And has it been too long?
and know that I was wrong
And this is still your song

I don't pretend to understand all the things I put you through
And I don't need forgiveness but I owe one thing to you
This is your song
This is your song---Lyrics submitted by Derek.
