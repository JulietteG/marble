In the morning
when you wake up, I
Like to believe you are
Thinking of me
And when the sun comes
Through your window, I
Like to believe you've been
Dreaming of me
Dreaming mmm...

I know
'cause I've spent
Half this morning
Thinking about the tee shirt you sleep in
I should know
'cause I'd spend
All the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping
And never deleting

When I saw you
Everyone knew I
liked the affect that you
Had on my eyes
But no one else heard
The way of your words, oh
Felt the affect that they
Have on my mind
Falling mmm...

I know
'cause I've spent
Half this morning
Thinking about the tee shirt you sleep in
I should know
'cause I'd spend
All the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping
And never deleting---
