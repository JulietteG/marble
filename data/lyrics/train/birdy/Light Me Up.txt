I'm finding my heart
Using my hands
You're my feet on the ground
My footprints

From where I began
I still carry your love
I feel your love

We start running, running
To escape this town
We don't know where we're going
Till we turn 'round
And I keep on running, running
I can't slow down
And if I'm lost where shadows fall

You light me up
When all I see is darkness
You light me up
When I'm down
And if I fall apart
You know where to find my pieces
When they can't be found

Keep my eyes shut
Safe in this trust
You're all that I need
My senses

Shining on me
I still carry your love
I feel your love

We start running, running
To escape this town
We don't know where we're going
Till we turn 'round
And I keep on running, running
I can't slow down
And if I'm lost where shadows fall

You light me up
When all I see is darkness
You light me up
When I'm down
And if I fall apart
You know where to find my pieces
When they can't be found

You light me up
When all I see is darkness
You light me up
When I'm down
And if I fall apart
You know where to find my pieces
When they can't be found

I'm finding my heart
Using my hands
You're my feet on the ground
My footprints

From where I began
I still carry your love
I feel your love

You light me up
When all I see is darkness
You light me up
When I'm down
And if I fall apart
You know where to find my pieces
When they can't be found

You light me up
When all I see is darkness
You light me up
When I'm down
And if I fall apart
You know where to find my pieces
When they can't be found

I'm finding my heart
Using my hands
You're my feet on the ground
My footprints

It flows in my blood
I still carry your love
I feel your love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
