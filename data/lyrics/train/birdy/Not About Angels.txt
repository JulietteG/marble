We're no fools of this just time.
So is it wrong to toss this life?
If your heart was full of love, could you give it up?

'Cuz what about, what about angels?
They will come; they will go make us special.
Don't give me up.
Don't give me up.

How unfair it's just our love.
Found something real that's out of touch.
But if you touch the full wide world.
Would you dare to let it go?

'Cuz what about, what about angels?
They will come; they will go make us special.
Don't give me up.
Don't give me up.

'Cuz what about, what about angels?
They will come; they will go make us special.

Not about, not about angels.
Angels.
