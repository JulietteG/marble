I can be strong when I want to be,
You think Im weak cause you can tear me apart with the words that you speak
You think youre in control
But you dont understand how much youre wrong
You choose to lash out at me, Ive done nothing wrong
All you crave is attention and just to belong
You need to belong

And I want to be free
When my heart is made from gold
And forgiveness seems too bold
As to find it in my heart
To say "I love you"
When my heart is made from gold
And the hunt is just too bold
As to find it in my heart
To say "I love you"

Is there not enough to use your love for me
To get past the things because you envy and hate
And the fires that they breathe
To say "I looked on the small"
Cant understand why you dont have it all
But you dont know how to fight for your "believe in your aims"
I just wanna do right by you, forget what has changed
Cause nothing is changed

And I want to be free
When my heart is made from gold
And forgiveness seems too bold
As to find it in my heart
To say "I love you"
When my heart is made from gold
And the hunt is just too bold
As to find it in my heart
To say "I love you"

For you have to be so mean
Youre such a drama queen
The way you play on every weakness that you see in me
To make you strong, knew all along
So dont pretend like you can hardly breathe
Like its down to me
Cause its so unfair that you cant see that youre so wrong
Were still so young

And I want to be free
When my heart is made from gold
And forgiveness seems too bold
As to find it in my heart
To say "I love you"
When my heart is made from gold
And the hunt is just too bold
As to find it in my heart
To say "I love you"---Lyrics submitted by Laura Young.
