Nothings in color, I cross the desert, nothings alive
What does the blacktop know that I have not cracked with my mind
Nothings in color, grey has appeal, nobody cry
Why do the street lamps shine out still, nothings black

I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while
I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while

Nothings in color, I cross the desert, nothings alive
What does the blacktop know that I have not cracked with my mind
Nothings in color, grey has appeal, deep in the eyes
Why do the street lamps shine out still when nothings alive

I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while
I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while

Why does my heartbeat feel like a speaker, feeding back [?] 
Why does my heartbeat feel like a speaker, feeding back [?] 
Why does my heartbeat feel like a speaker, feeding back [?] 
Why does my heartbeat feel like a speaker, feeding back

I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while
I feel love every million miles
I feel love every once in a while---
