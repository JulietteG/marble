The lightning that's caught in between us;
Fades into the eyes of the day;
Creedence is strong as horizon;
Forward the cry;
Blood soaked landslide; In the blue sky;
tortured by darkness the sun obeys;
And you dead kids;
I'll give you something worth fighting for;
And open your eyes;
The flood of the fountain receives us;
Beckon to the light and the fade;
Mad house of pain without reason
Oh fuck and defy; Blackout the battle cry;
and blue sky;
Tortured by darkness the sun obeys;
And your dead kids;
I'll give you something worth fighting for;
And open their eyes!

The light of the compass, the feeling this day;
Open their eyes, space for the lives;
Severence is calling they know where we lie;
Save you we try, welcome to the new life;
And blue sky;
Tortured by darkness the sun obeys;
And your dead kids;
I'll give you something worth fighting for;
And open their eyes!---Lyrics submitted by gabriel.
