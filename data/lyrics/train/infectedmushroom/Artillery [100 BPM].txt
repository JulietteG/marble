The three dimensional professional projection of spectral light
Connected been selection air tight
The isolated this assistive victory stimulated
The non-simulated, patterns of flight originated
Now I'm a carnivore on a tour of duty
My band of brothers and full metal jackets establish cruelty
Black magic conjurer attack through the monitor
Destruction of assumption - one thing I can promise ya

It half-cracked with cold,sharp glass
Ritualistic annihilators that murder your cast
The future of the passed, that last that feel
The seventh seal broken in half, ceremony is real
Become obsolete high strung from a beat
A strong minded individual, delivering defeat
Blood rivers in the street,keep flowing or retreat
Deep omens keep opponents speech limited, repeat

(Whispered)
You're opening the doors to the corridor stretching to the left
Anger within my eyes, but the truth is on my chest
I'm just a man who want some revenge, and I confess
I'm full of rage and sin, locked inside this cage again
Where evil reigns and people like to win
It may seem sweet, but we won't like the end
So we shine brightly from the light within

You're opening the doors to the corridor stretching to the left
Anger within my eyes, but the truth is on my chest
I'm just a man who want some revenge, and I confess
I'm full of rage and sin, locked inside this cage again
Where evil reigns and people like to win
It may seem sweet, but we won't like the end
So we shine brightly from the light within

Locked inside this cage again (x4)

Turn the music up a bit...

Yo, yo...
Dark secrets, demons with a conscience
I'm the lone ranger looking for Pocahontas
Teenage zombies flying to be,
I'm dying to learn what I'm trying to be
Go Bad News Bears and the Dukes of Hazard
The youth of my group is the truth - so have it
Keep myself couped up, recoup quickly
Face still hurts but my kids stick with me
Death loved not far as we go,
Crazy face still not star of the show
I appreciate the chance to hurt, I'll kill you
Ice pick into your neck, I will do anything
Talk to you like I might care, anything
Rippled by the nightmare, moonshine distillary
Back roads to villiany
Military star, I depart with artillery

With artillery (x14)
With Ta Ra Ta Ta Ta Ta...

Locked inside this cage again (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Silly Stalkers.
