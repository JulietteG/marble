Come on and dance (x2)

Do you wanna, Do you wanna, Do you wanna, Do you wanna, Do you wanna rock some more?!
Do you wanna rock some more?
Rock! Rock!
Do you wanna rock some more?!

Party People Rock! (x2)

[verse 1]

My people, you and you!

All you party people, heh! He!
I like to lift your spirits!
And to raise it with music!
To make you dance, the river dance!

Soca party, vibration!
Automatic conversion!
To make you dance, the river dance!

Party People Rock! (x4)

[verse 2]

Marshall the place, burning out!
Everybody, inside out!
Listen to it, get in the mood!
That's so, the way you should, hey!!

Party People Rock! (x2)

I want to whole party, get in the mood!

[Chorus]The whole party, rock on and move!

I want to whole party, get in the mood!

[Chorus]The whole party, rock on and move!

Party People, just aways!
Party People, rock the place!

Party People, just aways!
Party People, rock the place!

[verse 3]

Party People Rock! (x4)

[Chorus]Get up and dance!

Can somebody scream?!

Do you wanna, Do you wanna, Do you wanna, Do you wanna, Do you wanna rock some more?! (x2)
