Oh, if they knew what is really going through her mind
How she dazzles triumphant, there's no competition
But when not dreaming, she thinks her world will fall apart
There's no one there to love her and quench this burning passion

We, ordinary people, sometimes frightened a little
Hiding our secret hopes, want an ordinary love
Need someone to hold

If they only knew what's going through her mind
If they only knew how lonely is her life
If only we could see through other people's eyes
We might understand each other's hearts

Woh oh oh, yeah hey hey
Woh oh oh, yeah hey hey
Woh oh oh, ooh yeah
We might understand each other's hearts

Oh, if they knew what is really going through his mind
He feels so helpless, his head in the sand, day an' nightmares
But the crowd around him believes he has the power
To change the world, stop wars and hunger
Yet for his dreams, no one cares

We, ordinary people, sometimes frightened a little

Hiding our secret hopes, want an ordinary love
Need someone to hold

If they only knew what's going through his mind
If they only knew how lonely is his life
If only we could see through other people's eyes
We might understand each other's hearts

Woh oh oh, yeah hey hey
Woh oh oh, yeah hey hey
Woh oh oh
We might understand each other's hearts

We, ordinary people, sometimes frightened a little
Hiding our secret hopes, want an ordinary love
Need someone to hold, oh

If they only knew what's going through her mind
If they only knew how lonely is her life
If only we could see through other people's eyes
We might understand each other's hearts

Woh oh oh, yeah hey hey
Woh oh oh, yeah hey hey
Woh oh oh
We might understand each other

If they only knew what's going through his mind
If they only knew how lonely is his life
If only we could see through other people's eyes
We might understand each other's hearts---Lyrics submitted by Barry Brickell.
