To be real,
Is to understand,
When I had you,
I was not completely into,
Cause I was blind,
I let you drift away,
I didnt give you,
Enough to stay,
So you made up my mind,
And you walked away.

And why do I,
Hold you tighter and tighter,
When I could do no wrong,
Its getting hotter and hotter,
Why did I hold you tighter and tighter,
How could I be so wrong,
I cant hold on,
To what is already gone,
Come back baby.

Dont be strong,
Dont let it go,
Are you out there?
With somewhere else,
Are you telling him no?
Cause I could be,
Your shelter from the rain,
Come inside now,
Not gonna give you pain,
Cause I made up my and,
Ill walk away.

And why didnt I,
Hold you tighter and tighter?
When I could do no wrong,
Its getting hotter and hotter,
Why didnt I hold you tighter and tighter,
How could I be so wrong,
I cant hold on,
To what is already gone,
Come back baby.

And why,
Oh why,
Wont you believe in me?

Why,
Oh why,
Wont you believe in me?

Why didnt I hold you tighter and tighter,
When I could do no wrong,
Its getting hotter and hotter.

Why didnt I hold you tighter and tighter,
How could I be so wrong,
Cant hold on,
To what is already gone.---Lyrics submitted by Shannon.
