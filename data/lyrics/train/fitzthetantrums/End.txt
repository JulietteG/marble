Somethings gotta get thru
If you wanna stay
You need to find a place for me

Your always saying were thru
then turn around and say you
Cant see no one else but me

Fought my way out
Ive been here before
Its a long way down this cold [?]
Stretch my wings out
Like the way before
[?]
Just

End all of our promises
The truth we know we cant save
End all of our promises
The reckless games that we play

I was to treat her
Like them other sneakers
Surely I would rule as king
But no matter how I treat her
She's always gonna linger 
On all the other boys but me.

Fought my way out
Ive been here before
Its a long way down this cold [?]
Stretch my wings out
[?]
Just

End all of our promises
The truth we know we cant save
End all of our promises
The reckless games that we play

End all of our promises
The truth we know we cant save
End all of our promises
The reckless games that we play

Theres no where to go
Just hanging round
When every thing we do keeps crashing down
Sings the song
This songs gone out of style
Were twisting our words
When we know we have to

End all of our promises
The truth we know we cant save
End all of our promises
The reckless games that we play

End all of our promises
The truth we know we cant save
End all of our promises
The reckless games that we play
End---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
