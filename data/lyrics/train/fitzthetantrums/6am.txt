Girl, I get tired of sleeping alone in my bed
I really need you now.
I've been trying to get back the days that we had
But see, I don't know how.
There's no way to conceive the right plans in my head.
I just can't hold them down.
All my hopes they stay curled in between these four walls,
And I can't shake them out.

It's 6 in the morning, I'm still awake
My sleepless heart is torn up, babe
A love song's on the radio,
But these words I hear  they're not for me, no.

I'm tryna keep up, tryna move on
Beyond this pain before I break.

See it's hard to confess, but I miss all the time we spent
I can't explain.
'Cause when I start up the nerve to reach out to you, baby,
It just floats away.
Still I dream of the days when we were on the same page.
I really want them now.
All my hopes they stay curled in between these four walls,
And I can't shake them out.

I'm tryna keep up, tryna move on
Beyond this pain, before I break.

Not for me,
They're not for me, no... ---
