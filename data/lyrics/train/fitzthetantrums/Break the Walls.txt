Hey! Break the walls. [x4]

Through the epic unconsciousness
Through the valley of beatin chests
Turn the sound down, still hear the roar
Let the beast out, what did you come for?

Give me a sledgehammer and give me strength
Watch the world come crumbling down
Cut me loose I seek the truth
I bet the freedom, the freedom will carry me

Hey! Break the walls [x4]

To the wild I travel the unknown
The fathers pray out to be overthrown
Turn the lights down oh to be blind at peace
Let the beast out and watch it bare its teeth

Give me a sledgehammer and give me strength
Watch the world come crumbling down
Cut me loose I seek the truth
I bet the freedom, the freedom will carry me

Hey! Break the walls [x4]

Kick and scream fight for the unseen
Fight for harmony, fight for you and me [x4]

Hey! Break the walls [x8]---
