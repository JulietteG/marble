Why do your eyes paralyze me?
What makes me feel this way?
Carry me away with silence and heartbeats as rapid 
Thinking about your embrace
And how it makes me feel
I just want to feel this way forever
Sleep on portraits painted as perfect as you
Why have I been given the chance to fly 
When I'm not with you I feel lesser alone
Why have I been given the chance to fly, away?
I remember your face imprinted on angels
Your voice as beautiful as the sounds of waves
Crashing against my heart
Time slows down when you look at me
I'm infatuated with this / infatuated with you
I remember your face imprinted on angels
It's so hard for me to understand
Why I hadn't found you before
Dont dull away,
Hold my hand
