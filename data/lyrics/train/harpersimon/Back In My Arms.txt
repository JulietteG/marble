I looked around so much
I couldn't see
In everything I looked at
Well, I only saw me

Now the sky is no longer blue
Leaves of grass are not green
I wanna drink in all the beauty in the world
Especially the things not seen

So I watched the birds
Until I stopped thinking about flight
I dream of the ocean 
On the Isle of Wight, every night and I..

I, I want you back
Back in my arms

What was I so afraid of
Always hiding my eyes
Never facing the truth
Never facing the lies

I've already stopped trying
to be in control
Maybe being at peace with yourself's a much better goal

But I'm the same old trouble I used to be
Only the same old trouble I used to be
Only the same old trouble I used to be
So why don't you call me...

'Cause now every star I see is not really there
Waves of light move in waves not entirely clear
Nothing's clear, but I...

I, I want you back
Back in my arms
Back in my arms---Lyrics submitted by Amanda Blaker.
