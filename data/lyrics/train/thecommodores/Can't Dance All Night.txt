Looking like a dream out on the floor
You haven't stopped since you walked in the door
I can't take my eyes of you
And I can feel you like me too
But all you wanna do is dance some more

This night was made for love
(This night was made for love)
When you gonna realise

Oh, you can't dance all night
So come home with me
And in the morning light
We'll be lying in ecstasy, my love

You know how to move
And you do it so right
But you can't dance all night, ooh

Quick before the rhythm starts to fade
One more dance
And then we'll steal away yeah
Stop this game of cat and mouse
It's time to let your feelings out
And write an ending to this passion play

This night was made for us
(This night was made for us)
I see the love lights in your eyes, oh

Oh, you can't dance all night
So come home with me
And in the morning light
We'll be lying in ecstasy, my love

You know how to move
And you do it so right
But you can't dance all night, auww

This night was made for love
(This night was made for love)
When you gonna realise

Oh, you can't dance all night
So come home with me
And in the morning light
We'll be lying in ecstasy, my love

You know how to move
And you do it so right
But you can't dance, can't dance, all night

You can't dance all night

Well you can't dance, can't dance all night

Can't dance all night

We'll be lying in ecstasy, my love
You know how to move and you do it so right---
