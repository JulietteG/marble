So united

It isn't always easy
We've been through a few hard times
But when we stick together
There's no mountain we can't climb

With all that we've been through
And everything we've done
Nothing comes between us ? we stand as one

United in love ? there's nothing we can't rise above
United in love ? whatever happens to us
United in love ? we'll always be
United in love ? so united

And if you reach your hand out
But your dreams just seem too far
Stand upon my shoulders
And you can touch that star

The road that we are on
May lead into the night
But we will walk together into the light

United in love there's nothing we can't rise above
United in love whatever happens to us
United in love we'll always be
United in love so united

As sure as day follows night
No matter who is wrong or right
No matter what we do or say
We always come away

United in love there's nothing we can't rise above
United in love whatever happens to us
United in love we'll always be
United in love so united

And if we stand by each other
Always respect one another
There's nothin' we can't do, no
There's nothin' we, we won't get through
No, no, no, no, we're so united---
