We started out as friends
And now we're turning into lovers
Look at what you doing to me
I used to be a ladies-man but not there is no other
Your tender love is all that i need

Girl,
If you can feel it
Let the music take your mind
Just leave it up to me
You'll have a real good time
Girl,
You know you want it
Feel the magic of my touch
Cant help the way i feel
I just want your love so much

Rock
I wanna rock you girl
Rock
I wanna rock you baby
Rock
I just wanna rock you girl
Rock

And all my friends keep telling me
They see you with another
I know you save your loving for me
I won't believe that you been loving someone undercover
I will not give you reason to leave

Girl,
If you can feel it
Let the music take your mind
Just leave it up to me
You'll have a real good time
Girl,
You know you want it
Feel the magic of my touch
Can't help the way i feel
I just want your love so much

Rock
I wanna rock you girl
Rock
I wanna rock you baby
Rock
I just wanna rock you girl
Rock

I wanna rock you

Although i had the pleasure
Of many other girls (other girls)
They were nothing like you
My job has taken me all over the world
So many changes I've been through
I can tell that you're a special girl
And that you are one of a kind
Baby baby all i want is a chance
Coz you are blowing my mind

I wanna rock

Rock
Rock
I wanna rock you
Rock
Blow my mind baby
You are, blowing my mind

Can you feel the music

Shake it down shake it down now

Feel the night
Earn my touch
I cant help it if i love you so much
I wanna rock
Baby i wanna rock rock you girl
I'm gonna rock---
