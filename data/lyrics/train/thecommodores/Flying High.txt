Flyin' high on a feelin'
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love

I knew we could make it from the beginning
The first time I saw you passing by, whoa
To me it was much more than a notion
It was the fire in your eyes

Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love

Your face has a glow, girl, like a sunrise
You speak in a whisper like the wind, whoa
And when I touch you I see clearly
That we can be more than just friends

Ooh
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo (Yeah, baby)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo (Woo)

Flyin' higher
For your love (Hey)
Flyin' higher
For your love

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Flyin' high on a feelin' (Baby, sing it loud)
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love

On your love (On your love)
On your love (On your love)
On your love (On your love)
Yeah

Flyin' (Whoa, oh)
Higher, higher (Woo), higher (High), higher, (Yeah)---
