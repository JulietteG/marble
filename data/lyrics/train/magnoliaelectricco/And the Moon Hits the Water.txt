First light of the world
and the moon hits the water
Never gets this dark until it knows what you owe

Was there ever any other way to live
I thought I had to always be strong
I thought I had to always be strong

Night does its work but doesn't always follow you home
Or does it?
The moon was the howling wolf that was walkin' the street
Moon was the mountain that washed the shadows from your feet

Was there ever any other way to live
I thought I had to always be wrong
Was there ever any other way to live
I thought I would always be strong
I thought I would always be strong---Lyrics submitted by ashley darner.
