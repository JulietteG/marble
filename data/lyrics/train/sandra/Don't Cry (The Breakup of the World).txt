(kemmler/cretu - kemmler/hirschburger)

People crowd together
Why dont you take it
Wait a little longer
An see how they make it

Twinin with time
Why cant you see me
Risk of eclipse
If you cant forgive me
Return to zero

The breakup of the world
Dont cry
Were gonna save our lifes
An time is on my side
Dont cry
Im gonna realize
The breakup of the world
Baby please dont cry
We can forgive
Were gonna try
Baby please dont cry
I wanna live
I fear the breakup of the world

World is torn an tattered
Why cant you take it
Hope a little longer
An see how well make it

Swallow your pride
Why cant you see me
Risk of eclipse
If you cant forgive me
Return to zero

The breakup of the world
Dont cry
Were gonna save our lifes
An time is on my side
Dont cry
Im gonna realize
The breakup of the world
Baby please dont cry
We can forgive
Were gonna try
I wanna live
I fear the breakup of the world---Lyrics submitted by ro2yak.
