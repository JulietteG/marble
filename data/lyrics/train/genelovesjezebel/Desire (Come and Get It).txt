Oh sugar I've been missing you. 
And I've been wondering, where it is you're hiding. 
I've been a ball of fire in your arms desire. 
And I've been wondering, where it is you're hiding.

What you get is what you seek.
Desire.
What you get is what you seek.
Desire.

Oh honey, I won't be kissing you. 
And I've been wondering, where it is you're hiding. 
I've been a ball of fire in your arms desire. 
And I've been wondering, where it is you're hiding.

What you get is what you seek.
Desire.
What you get is what you seek.
Desire.

I've had my ears to the ground, to the ground.
I'm just trying to find out what you're hiding.
What is the mystery?

What you get is what you seek.
Desire.
What you get is what you seek.
Desire.---Lyrics submitted by sherlock.
