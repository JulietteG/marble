The weatherman said today
Theres a slight chance of rain
I had to laugh to myself,
Cause on any given day its been a hurricane
Knocking down my power lines
Shaking my foundation
Breaking all my window panes

Ill build again and Ill send you a letter
Self-addressed so you know
Exactly where to go
Please dont reply, just arrive
With the future in your eyes I adore
Show me what theyre for

This is inevitable, oh
When will you believe
This is inevitable, oh
Time may turn the leaves
Its so inevitable that we
Will eventually see
Another spring again
On that you can depend

Somebody thinks they won a lifetime
In your sun
Fancy restaurants, cocaine nights
Thinking youre the one
To give him every touch
But I know so much better
Its a matter of a moment
Til you break into a run

Youre gonna try with all your might
To forget
But like a ghost I appear
To whisper in your ear
Then Ill see you smile
As you dial all the numbers
Memorized, filed away
For this very day

This is inevitable, oh
When will you believe
This is inevitable, oh
Time may turn the leaves
But its inevitable that we
Will eventually see
Another spring again
On that you can depend

This is inevitable, oh
As long as we still breathe
This is inevitable, oh
The tide may move the sea
But its inevitable that we
Will eventually see
These waters rise again
On that you can depend

You can try to deny it baby
You can try, you can try
You can try to deny it baby
You can try your best

This is inevitable, oh
When will you believe
This is inevitable, oh
Time may turn the leaves
But its inevitable that we
Will eventually see
Another spring again
On that you can depend

This is inevitable, oh
As long as we still breathe
This is inevitable, oh
The tide may move the sea
But its inevitable that we
Will eventually see
These waters rise again
On that you can depend---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
