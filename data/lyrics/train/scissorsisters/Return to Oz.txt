Once there was a man
Who had a little too much
Time on his hands
He never stopped to think
That he was getting older
When his night came to an end
He tried to grasp for his last friend
And pretend 
That he could wish himself health
On a four-leaf clover

He said is this the return to Oz?
The grass is dead
The gold is brown
And the sky has claws
There's a wind-up man
Walking round and round
What once was Emerald City's
Now a crystal town

It's three o'clock in the morning
You get a phone call
From the queen with a hundred heads
She says that they're all dead
She tried the last one on
It couldn't speak, fell off
And now she just wanders the halls
Thinking nothing
Thinking nothing at all

She said is this the return to Oz?
The grass is dead 
The gold is brown
And the sky has claws
There's a wind-up man
Walking round and round
What once was Emerald City's 
Now a crystal town

The wheelies are cutting the pavement
And the Skeksis at the rave meant
To hide deep inside
Their sunken faces
And their wild rolling eyes
But their callous words reveal
That they can no longer feel
Love or sex appeal
The patchwork girl has come to cinch the deal

To return to Oz
We've fled the world
With smiles and clenching jaws
Please help me friend from coming down
I've lost my place and now it can't be found
Is this the return to Oz?
The grass is dead
The gold is brown
And the sky has claws
There's a wind-up man
Walking round and round
What once was Emerald City's
Now a crystal town---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
