What's up? It's Pickles. Leave a message.
Hey, I'm calling you back.
Oooh, she's been a bitch tonight.
And by bitch I mean this rain; no cab, nowhere.
So I had to put on the wig, and the heels
And the lashes, and the ears, and take the train, to the club
And you know the MTA should stand for:
Motherfuckers Touching My Ass
So then I get to the club
Looking like a drowned, harassed rat
And I'm greeted, not by Miss Rose at the door
But our friend, Johnny Five-O
Yes honey, the NYPD shut down the party
So no fee for me, and I don't even know what's the tea!
So I hope you're up girl
Because we are all coming over
Lock the doors, lower the blinds
Fire up the smoke machine and put on your heels
'Cause I know exactly what we need

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors, tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve, and work and turn
And h-h-honey

A kiki is a party, for calming all your nerves
We're spilling tea, and dishing just desserts one may deserve
And though the sun is rising, few may choose to leave
So shade that lid and we'll all bid adieu to your ennui

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors, tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve, and work and turn
And h-h-honey

Oh, what a wonderful kiki
This kiki is marvelous

(Work it girl, very liberty, eww, you know girl
We were sitting back here just having a kiki)

(Kiki, Soso, Oui Oui, Non Non) [x4]

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors, tight
Let's have a kiki, motherfucker
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve, and work and turn
And h-h-honey

Let's have a kiki, I wanna have a kiki
Lock the doors, tight
Let's have a kiki, hunty, drop her
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki
I wanna have a kiki
Boots, turn, queen
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve, and work and turn
And h-h-honey ---Lyrics submitted by Shane.
