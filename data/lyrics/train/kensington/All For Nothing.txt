Hurry up now, don't you know that I'm waiting
For the way you will find how to ruin it all
All that you're bending is all that I'm breaking
For the way you will build is the way you will fall

And I know that I will be ready
Or I will be dead again
I know in my head
I know in my heart
That I will be better
Than I would've ever been
Or all that we had
Was all for nothing after all

Hurry up now, don't you see that I'm fading
Into older man's grey and oblivion light
Who would I be to forgive and embrace when
When your talk is as low as your head is high

Is it all we live for, now I see you don't get it
When you call it a loss and I call it a win

And I know that I will be ready
Or I will be dead again
I know in my head
I know in my heart
That I will be better
Than I would've ever been
Or all that we had
Was all for nothing after all

And I know that I will be ready
Or I will be dead again
I know in my head
I know in my heart
That I will be better
Than I would've ever been
Or all that we had

And I know that I will be ready
Or I will be dead again
It's all in my head
It's all in my heart
And I will be better
Than I would've ever been
Or all that we had---
