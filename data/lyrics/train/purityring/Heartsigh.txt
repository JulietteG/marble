Whisper, whimper on; I
Won't forget to close your eyes for you
Ill sing before you lie down, down; and
Push your sleep along; I'll

Sink below the ground; find
The weeping wailing calls you echo, and I'll
Build a house around you
Stir a moat until you drown, down

Whisk away your heartsigh and
Bury it in mine, I'll
Whisk away your heartsigh
And bury it in mine

Only lonely hidden breath beneath the floor
(breath beneath the floor)
Only, only where your tears drip from the drawers
Only lonely hid the morning from the stars
Only, only weeping glimmers in the dark

I can hear your back cracking
Over the sky so you can wear it
And thunder whispered low so you could
Bear it in

I'll
Whisk away your heartsigh and
Bury it in mine, I'll
Whisk away your heartsigh
And bury it in mine

Come down, come now back;
Carry on, wearily on now?
Come down, come now back;
Carry on, wearily on now?

Only lonely hidden breath beneath the floor
(breath beneath the floor)
Only, only where your tears drip from the drawers
Only lonely hid the morning from the stars
Only, only weeping glimmers in the dark

Whisk away your heartsigh and (...away your heartsigh)
Bury it in mine (bury it in mine)
Whisk away your heartsigh (...away your heartsigh)
And bury it in mine (bury it in mine)---
