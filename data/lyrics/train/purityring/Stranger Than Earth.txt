I had a feeling you broke
And the smoke filled you up
I wasn't thinking 'bout you

You have a mind that makes sight
Of the weight you took up
I wasn't thinking 'bout you

Again, again, again
I wasn't thinkin 'bout you
I wasn't
I wasn't
Again, again, again
I wasn't thinkin 'bout you
I wasn't
I wasn't

There is a color that shines through your skin
Like a moon on the wind when I dare bear you in
The night is full on the half of your evaded mass ...
And the rings round your eyes.

We are stranger than earth
With her seasons misled
Stronger than the moons
When our parts parted, she had bled and bled and bled
I wasn't thinkin' bout you

There is no lesson in magic
There were untimely dreams where I knew
Broken in a fog, don't sweat it
And reckon none of it had come from you
There is no lesson in magic
There were untimely dreams where I knew
Broken in a fog, don't sweat it
And reckon none of it had come from you

Pity seek what we might lose
But in a week might our weakness elude

There was a stagger that shift in my hips
So how swiftly it shook the dew from my lips
There was a danger that seeped from my skull
How it dripped on us all
But it wasn't your fault

We are stranger than earth
With her seasons misled
Stronger than the moons
When our parts parted, she had bled and bled and bled
I wasn't thinkin' bout you

Again, again, again
I wasn't thinkin 'bout you
I wasn't thinkin 'bout you
I wasn't thinkin bout you
Again, again, again
I wasn't thinkin 'bout you
I wasn't thinkin 'bout you
I wasn't

And we break downstairs with our fevers in the air
I forgot to ask now I only left them there

How thick it sips and now your eyes glare
How thick it sips and why your eyes glare

Pity seek what we might lose
But in a week might our weakness elude---
