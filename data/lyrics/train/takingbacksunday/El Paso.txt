Cradle the sound.
Caller, speak through your teeth.
I was, well, I've been away.
I never know what to think.
What I wanted to know?
"Where did God sway,"
And if,
"The silence was gold when you got your way."

You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get.

My eyes got some,
Those perverts are sick.
I held the truth on my tongue,
Held it now until when.
What?
I wanted to know whether God was awake.
Because I was there as you, you played,
And you, you fools, you look all the same.

You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get.
You'll never give what you,
(You all look the same)
You'll never give what you get.
You'll never give what you get.
(You all look the same)
You'll never give what you want.
You'll never want what you get.
(You all look the same)
Just do your best to forget.
Just do your best to forget.
(You all look the same)

You got your way,
You got away,
When God, he was away.
You got your way,
You got away,
When God, he was away.
You got your way,
You got away,
When God, he was away.
You got your way,
You got away,
When God, he was away.

You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get.
You'll never give what you,
You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll never give what you get, no.
You'll do your best to forget.
You'll do your best to forget.
Do your best to forget.---Lyrics submitted by Sabrina.
