Get up, get up
Come on, come on, lets go
Theres just a few things
I think that you should know
Those words at best
Were worse than teenage poetry
Fragment ideas
And too many pronouns
Stop it, come on
Youre not making sense now
You cant make them want you
Theyre all just laughing

Literate and stylish (literate and stylish)
Kissable and quiet (kissable and quiet)
Well thats what girls dreams are made of
And thats all you need to know (and thats all you need to know)
You have it or you dont (you have it or you)
You have it or you (dont)

You have it you know
You see how much time youre wastin? 
Youre coward of seperatin

Stop it, come on
You know I cant help it
I got the mic
And you got the mosh pit
What will it take
To make you admit that you were wrong? 
Was his demise so carefully constructed? 
Well lets just say I got what I wanted
Cause in the end its always the same (it's justified!)
Lets go

Literate and stylish (literate and stylish)
Kissable and quiet (kissable and quiet)
Well thats what girls dreams are made of
And thats all you need to know (and thats all you need to know)
You have it or you dont (you have it or you)
You have it or you (dont) dont

This is me with the words on the tip of my tongue
And my eye through the scope
Down the barrel of a gun (gun,gun)
Remind me not to ever act this way again
This is you trying hard to
Make sure that youre seen
With a girl on your arm
And your heart on your sleeve
Remind me not to ever think of you again
This is me with the words
On the tip of my tongue
And my eye through the scope
Down the barrel of a gun
Remind me not to ever act this way again (again)
Again (again)

This is me with the words
On the tip of my tongue
And my eye on the scope
Down the barrel of a gun
Ill never act this way again

Rest the weight (I know somethin that you dont know)
Youve had your chance and folded
So hold your breath
Because youll only make things worse
Rest the weight (I know somethin that you dont know)
Youve had your chance and folded
So hold your breath
Because youll only make things worse

(I know somethin that you dont know)
This is me with the words
(I know somethin that you dont know)
And you sure dont
Hold your, hold your breath
(I know somethin that you dont know)
Because youll only make things worse
Hold your breath
Because youll only make things worse
Hold your breath
(I know somethin that you dont know)
Because youll only make things worse

So hold your breath because youll only make things worse!---Lyrics submitted by Sheila Lucas.
