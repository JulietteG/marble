Open the gate to your apartment complex
your not getting off that easliy
I climb the fence the one that you've been sitting on (how long)
before I'm just a memory (how long)
before you can't remember me (how long)
remember me

I never had a choice I never had a choice
thru it it's so cold molden
around thats you his doorway
I couldn't find the parts to fix the whistles nagging in my brain (how long)
before I'm just a memory (how long)
before you can't remember me (how long)
remember me 

Lover love will own the fence 
bat your eyes bottle fisted 
swing, swing (swing, swing, swing) 
before you leave 
lover lover tell me this 
passion over consequence 
when did the ladder take the lead 
just swing 

just swing, swing, swing (swing, swing)

I never had a choice I never had a choice
the evening lends itself
watch my reservations fall to the floor fall to the floor
now sing with me (how long)
before I'm just a memory (how long)
before you can't remember me (how long)
remember me

Lover love will own the fence 
bat your eyes bottle fisted 
swing, swing (swing, swing, swing) 
before you leave 
lover lover tell me this 
passion over consequence 
when did the ladder take the lead 
just swing 

Open the gate to your apartment complex
did you forget that your who called for me (did you forget did you forget)
how long did you expect to keep me waiting (did you forget did you forget)
how long before i'm just a memory 

Lover love will own the fence 
well bat your eyes bottle fisted 
swing, swing (swing, swing, swing) 
before you leave 
lover lover tell me this 
well passion over consequence 
since when did the ladder take the lead 
just swing, swing, swing, swing (swing, swing, swing)
just swing, swing, swing
just swing---Lyrics submitted by ROBERT.
