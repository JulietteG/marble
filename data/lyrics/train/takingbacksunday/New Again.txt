My dear what long arms you have
All the better to hold you down
Slap my wrist with that sweet consequence
What are we, what are we to do
What are we to do with you (hey hey)
What are we, what are we to do
What are we to do with you

Well I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)
Well I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)

My dear what deep roots you have (all the better)
All the better to hold you down
We lived inside our branches
your familie's nests asks "Boy, where have you been?"
No you don't know where I've been
What are we to, to do with you
What are we to, to do with you

Well I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)
Well I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)

don't know where I've been...
don't know where I've been...
My dear what long arms you have
All the better to hold you down

Well I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)
Well I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)

You don't know where I've been...
You don't know where I've been...
You don't know where I've been...
You don't know where, you don't know where no...

I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)
Well I am, I am, I'm ready to be new again
I'm ready to hear you say who I am is quite enough
(Quite enough)---Lyrics submitted by sheva.
