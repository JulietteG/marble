Oh, I don't know where you're going,
But I know where you've been.
I've been tracing all your footsteps.
I've been counting all your sins.

A ticking bomb,
A false alarm,
A wrecking ball,
You left before I had the chance to say...

Call me in the morning.
Call me when you're home.
I know what you've been through,
Don't let go.

You reached into my mouth,
Pulled out a single bloody tooth.
I've never shown that to anyone,
Yeah, no one knows but you.

A ticking bomb,
A false alarm,
A wrecking ball,
I had left before you had the chance to say...

Just call me in the morning.
Call me when you're home.
I know what you've been through,
Don't let go, honey, don't let go.

Just call me in the morning.
Call me when you're home.
I know what you've been through,
Don't let go.

You never knew that it would take so long,
To understand you're right where you belong.

I don't where we're going,
But I know where we've been.
We've been hiding from each other.
We've been hiding from our sins.

Call me in the morning.
Call me when you're home.
I know what you've been through,
Don't let go.

Call me in the morning.
Call me when you're home.
I know what you've been through,
Don't let go.

Don't let go.
Don't know where we're going.
Don't let go.
But I know where we've been.
Don't let go.
We've been hiding from each other.
Don't let go.
We've been hiding from our sins.

Call me when you're home.
I know what you've been through,
Don't let go.---Lyrics submitted by Sabrina.
