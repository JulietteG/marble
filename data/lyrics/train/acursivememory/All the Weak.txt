The road seems so far from here (from here)
And I know everything seems so clear (so clear)

All the weak don't fall beneath the sky
All the weak don't leave this life behind

Sometimes the world stops meeting you
and sometimes your life starts deceiving you
When you see that no one is around,
Then there's a new direction that we have found

I feel everything you feel
It's real, all those things you feel

All the weak don't fall beneath the sky
All the weak don't leave this life behind

Sometimes the world stops meeting you
And sometimes your life starts deceiving you
When you see that no one is around
Then there's a new direction that we have found

You don't have to be somebody else to be happy

So I'll mess with your head and take my time back,
To whom it may concern, it lacks,
The fire that he had and I realize I can't do this
The sunset at the end of the road
And I felt his face stare through the window
And I'm thinking you should know
I can't do this on my own

Sometimes the world stops meeting you
And sometimes your life starts deceiving you
When you see that no one is around
Then there is a new direction that we have found---Lyrics submitted by Joyce.
