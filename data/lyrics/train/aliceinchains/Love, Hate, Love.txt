Ooh...

I tried to love you, I thought I could
I tried to own you, I thought I would
I wanna peel the skin from your face
Before the real you lays to waste

You told me I'm the only one
Sweet little angel, you should have run
Lying, crying, dying to leave
Innocence creates my hell

Cheated myself, still, you know more
It would be so easy with a whore
Try to understand me little girl
My twisted passion to be your world

Lost inside my sick head
I live for you, but I'm not alive
Take my hands before I kill
I still love you, but I still burn

Yeah! Love, hate, love!---Lyrics submitted by Thanatos.
