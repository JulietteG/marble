So young, so brazen, so unholy
I come to you in painted skies
Your broken saint, your ancient story
The living challenge to your lies

Trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
They wanna force my hand
Until I...

Take what I wanted, and
Break all the lies and
Defeat the fuckin' liars...
Smash all the temples, and
Crawl through the rubble, and
Cry to the fallen

I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law

A wolf alone upon the hillside
I live on what they throw away
I go to sleep behind the eight ball
I live to fight for one more day

Trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
They wanna force my hand
Until I...

Take what I wanted, and
Break all the lies and
Defeat the fuckin' liars...
Smash all the temples, and
Crawl through the rubble, and
Cry to the fallen

I'm the last of my kind still standing...
I'm the last of my kind still standing on the wall

I'm the last of my kind still standing...
I'm the last of my kind still standing...---Lyrics submitted by Romain.
