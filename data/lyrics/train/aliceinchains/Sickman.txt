Yeah!

What the hell am I?
Thousand eyes, a fly
Lucky then I'd be
In one day deceased

Sickman! Sickman, sickman, sickman
Aaaahhhhhh!

I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear
Ahh, what's the difference, I'll die
Ahh, in this sick world of mine

Yeah!

What the hell am I?
Leper from inside
Inside wall of peace
Dirty and diseased

Sickman! Sickman, sickman, sickman
Aaahhhhh!

I can see the end is getting near
I won't rest until my head is clear
Ahh, what's the difference, I'll die
Ahh, in this sick world of mine

Can you see the end?
Choke on me my friend
Must to drown these thoughts
Purity over rot

Yeah!

What the hell have I?
Worn eroded pride
Saddened ten miles wide
I'm gon' let it slide

Sickman! Sickman, sickman, sickman
Aaahhhhh!

I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear
Ahh, what's the difference, I'll die
Ahh, in this sick world of mine
Ahhhhh.....---Lyrics submitted by Thanatos.
