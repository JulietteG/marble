What does friend mean to you? 
A word so wrongfully abused 
Are you like me, confused? 
All included but you 
Alone 

The sounds of silence often soothe 
Shapes and colours shift with mood 
Pupils widen and change their hue 
Rapid brown avoid clear blue 

Why's it have to be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way

Flowers watched through wide eyes bloom 
A child sings an unclaimed tune 
Innocence spins cold cocoon 
Grow to see the pain too soon 

Why's it have to be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way

 At 7 am on a Tuesday in August 
Next week I turn 28 
I'm still young, it'll be me 
Off the wall I scraped you 
I gotta wake 
I gotta wake, it comes this way 
I can't wait no more 
It comes this way, it comes this way 
To drown this ache 
To reinstate (Everyone dead, everyone) 
(You put me through) Take your place 
Heaven direct your shape (Heaven direct, you see I can do it so well) 

Your expiration date 
Your expiration date, fate, date 
Expiration date 
This one is gonna last too, hate 
Never gonna fuck with me again 
Mans own clean slate 
Don't fuck with me again 
Makes your eyes dilate 
Makes you shake 
I'm right---Lyrics submitted by Sun.
