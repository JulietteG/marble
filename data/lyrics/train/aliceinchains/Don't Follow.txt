Hey, I ain't never comin' home
Hey, I'll just wander my own road
Hey, Hey I cant meet you here tomorrow
Say goodbye don't follow
Misery so hollow

Hey you, you're livin life full throttle
Hey you, pass me down that bottle, yeah
Hey you, you can't shake me round now
I get so lost and don't know how 
And it hurts to care, I'm going now

Forgot my woman, lost my friends
Things I'd done and where I've been
Sleep in sweat the mirrors cold
See my face it's growin' old
Scared to death no reason why
Do whatever to get me by
Think about the things I said
Read the page it's cold and dead and

Take me Home
Yeah take me home
oh home
Take me home
Take me home yeah
Take me home

Say goodbye don't follow...---Lyrics submitted by Jodie.
