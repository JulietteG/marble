know me broken by my master,
teach thee on child of love hereafter,

into the flood again,
same old trip it was back then,
so I made a big mistake,
try to see it once my way,

drifting body, its sole exertion,
flying, not yet quite the notion,

into the flood again,
same old trip it was back then,
so I made a big mistake,
try to see it once my way,
am I wrong?
have I run too far to get home
have I gone?
and left you here all alone

am I wrong?
have I run too far to get home
have I gone?
and left you here all alone

if I would?could you?---Lyrics submitted by austin.
