And so I found myself in the sun, oh yeah...
A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah...

(Chorus)
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's alright
Somebody check my brain

I walked these streets a creep in a fog, oh yeah...
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah...


(Chorus)

Tears that fill my bong...
Years expended gone...

I hung my guns and put 'em away, oh yeah...
A trick of the trade and by the way, oh yeah...

(Chorus)

Tears that fill my bong...
Years expended gone...
