Turning in circles, slowing down
Pulling against a closing out
Easy to feed off a weaker thing
Harder to say what I really mean

Chorus:
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky

All of your colors turn to grey
Dont even matter anyway
Bleeding impressions where you were tied
Cant really say how you lost your mind

Chorus:
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence so loud, silence
I cant tell my up from down
Silence so loud, Silence
I cant tell my u from down

All of the faces life can show
Withered and ugly the one you know

Chorus:
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence so loud, silence
I cant tell my up from down
Silence so loud, Silence
I cant tell my up from down---
