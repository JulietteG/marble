Humble and helpless won't you listen, learning to pray. Praying for a vision, like no other, to show me the way. 

Show my the way to forgive you.
Allow me to let it go. Allow to me to forgive you.
Show me the way to let go. Show me the way to forgive you.
Allow me to let it go. (and) Allow me to me forgiven.
Show me the way to let go.

Illuminate me and the only way
Say it to me, that I can be the way.
Just praying for you to show me right in the begining.

(Show, Show, Show)

Tell that to her. (pray like that)
Give in to what?
Come back to us. (tell me)
Go back to her.

Can't breath again.
(Give up to what)
Reconnect.---Lyrics submitted by savannah.
