I ain't just gonna wait wait around in a town
That's just going to weigh weigh me down
Got real big plans
I'm not doing a thing

I just gotta get get away
So come on baby, what do you say?
Let's watch the palm trees sway
Can't you see it?
Ooh, don't you want to feel it too?
Won't stop till we see blue
Baby just me and you
And a whole lotta nothin' to do

We wake up
I won't put on my makeup
Walk down to the beach front
Hair blowing in the wind
Maybe if we're lucky through the weekend
Sail away from dry land
Spend the whole day laughing
'Cause we're never going back again
No-o-o

I ain't just gonna wait wait around in a town
That's ust going to weigh weigh me down
Got real big plans
I'm not doing a thing

I just gotta get get away
So come on baby, what do you say?
Let's watch the palm trees sway
Can't you see it?
Ooh, don't you want to feel it too?
Won't stop till we see blue
Baby just me and you
And a whole lotta nothin' to do---
