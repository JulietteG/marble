Quick to light and slow to burn
Soothes the pain and brings the hurt
All these smoke filled memories surrounding me
Things I wish I could regret
Like this cigarette

Tastes like honey on my lips
Sweet addiction lures me in
With every breathe I want you more
so much more
Feels too good to just forget
Like this cigarette

Wish that I could quit you 
Oh but love just fans the flame
Holding on so tightly as we slowly go to waste

Like this cigarette

oh woh oh woh
oh woh oh oo
oh woh oh woh
oh woh oh woh
oh woh oh woh
oh woh oh woh

Wish that I could quit you 
Oh but love just fans the flame
Holding on so tightly as we slowly go to waste

Like this cigarette

Quick to light and slow to burn
Soothes the pain and brings the hurt---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Aristo.
