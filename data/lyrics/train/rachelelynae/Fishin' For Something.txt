Been out with the girls all night long
Kickin it up with our blue jeans on
You keep casting looks at me
Throw out a line and ask me to leave

Well I don't know who you think you are
But you're pushing your luck just a little too far
You're workin that grin but baby don't bother
You're fishin for something that ain't in the water

You can keep on trying
But boy I'm just not biting
I know you want to catch me but
You're swimming up the wrong creek
If you think this'll get any hotter
You're fishin' for something that ain't in the water
Fishin' for something that ain't in the water

Daddy taught me all I need to know
Bout what to keep and which ones to throw
You're flashing those eyes but you can be sure
I know all about your fancy lures

Baby you need to lower that bar
Cause you're pushin your luck just a little too far
I've been raised a gentleman's daughter
You're fishing for something that ain't in the water

Cut the bait baby
I'm not your lady
Pack it up honey

Been out with the girls all night long
Kickin it up with our blue jeans on

Throw out a line and ask me to leave

You're workin that grin but baby don't bother
You're fishin for something that ain't in the water

You can keep on trying
But boy I'm just not biting
I know you want to catch me but
You're swimming up the wrong creek

You're fishin' for something that ain't in the water
Fishin' for something that ain't in the water
