I thought I'd begun, to see a change
But the more things change, the more they stay the same
Back stabbing and name calling, the trademarks of your act
You talk and talk of unity, but divide with your attacks

(You say)
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change, but I'm too busy...
Tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down 
Go!

All us kids, we try to make a change
Some kids start a band, others start a zine
YOU!!!, no matter what your path
You throw a curve in what could be achieved,
Then give up and move onto some other thing

(You say)
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change, but I'm too busy...
Tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down

Take a break
from your fights,
try to open your mind tonight
When you feel
that's complete
then we can tackle this society!!!

You may not like 
everything in life I do...
but that doesn't mean 
I'm not trying to change
the same problems as you

(You say)
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change
I'd like to see a change, but I'm too busy...
Tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down
Tearing everyone down (down!) down! (down!) down! (down!)
Tearing everyone down (down!) down! (down!) down! (down!)
Tearing everyone down
