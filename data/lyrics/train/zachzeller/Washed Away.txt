I've crossed these paths before
While knocking down our doors
I've played this song to you
It's yours a frightful tune
Just leave it all behind
Face forward and leave it in the past
You've read this book to me
As I bathed in the tub
You were gone in my darkest days
I sent cards while you were away
I'll take this to my grave
And I swear
I wish you would have stayed---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
