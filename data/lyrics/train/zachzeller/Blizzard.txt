You tore up my pictures
And you put them in a chest
There I lay facing
All of the rest
It's a test , for the best, I can't win
It entails me to fail, I won't touch it
I moved on to bigger and better things
That turned me red
Got caught in a blizzard
And it messed with my head
I can't see, won't believe what you tell
I'm alright and delighted that you care
I looked in the mirror
And saw a much older face
I was disgusted
It had seen better days
I lost track, welcome back, nice to see you
Won't delay, here to stay, as for now---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
