With bottled eyes and fingers clinched so tight
He swung and hit me to the floor
Put up my fists tossing side to side
The old man got what he deserved
Grabbed a shovel carved out his shallow grave
Pushed him in said our goodbyes
It took us thirty years to end this household rage
Sometimes death is the only way
He's finally proud of me
Oh my son
Oh dear mother it was the only way
You and brother can be free
He's in the ground
Satan has his hand
Jesus glimpsed and turned the other way
The men in blue came knocking at the door
Guns drawn blood rushing to the top
They shot and hit me
My body hit the floor
Oh sweet savior why'd you turn away
You've forsaken me
Oh my son---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
