Call him like you want him

Look at myself in the mirrorrrr
Religion lookin back at me
Iii threw my hands in the air
and the lawwww arrested me
calll interruuupted
I needed to break out and get freedom
one bad decision after the neext
just getting by, letting you figureee meeee, ooohhhh

Jesus
Call him like you want him
Call him like you need him
but Jesus yeah Jesus yeah

Curses unbroken yeahhhh
Still holding me down Bondage, 
i was even thinking 
I wasn't good enough for Gods Best
But Iiiim in my closet
Yes I am
Im in my closet
Time after time
Praying Jesus, singing Jesus, cryyyyyying Jesus

Jesus
Call him like you want him (Call him)
Call him like you need him (Call him ohh ,call him Jesus)
Jesus
There is no other like him in my life
Religion died in my life

Call him like you need him 
You gotta get down on your knees and call on Jesus
I dare you
I dare you to think of one thing and testify, testify to yourself, heyy heeyyy
