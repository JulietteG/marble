Barter and trade, always passive aggresive,
in spite of who you say you are.
Smother my name under soil and dirt
in the earth, widen the distance apart.

Fuck an apology, I'm not sorry for anything.
I've been holding back my apathy for far too long.
You don't deserve what you haven't earned,
and you place in my heart has just grown so small.

I'd like to think that you're worth the time,
but you embody everything that I hate.
Take a good hard look at what you see.
I've lost all my hope and all of my faith,

'cause when I barely fuck up you just recoil and weep.
What do you want from me? I'm just a kid who got in too deep.
My walls are built of up high, forever bound to be steep.
I've got a bird's eye view of all the secrets you keep.

Try to tell me that you knew from the start,
that I would come to know that most would never
enter my heart because I'm colder than tht other.
It's what sets me apart.

You manipulated, tried to shine a light on my dark.
But this is my life. You should bounce and never call again.

The more strive you'll find it,
in the souls of all the other men.
You know you're not as smart as you look.
I'm gonna take back what you took.

I'd like to think that you're worth my time,
but you embody everything I hate.
Take a good hard look at what you see.
I've lost all my hope and all my faith.

'Cause when I barely fuck up you just recoil and weep.
What do you want from me? I'm just a kid who got in too deep.
My walls are built up high, forever bound to be steep.
I've got a birds eye view of all the secrets you keep.

You know, you're not as smart as you look.
I'm gonna got take back what you took.
And you didn't know shit from the start.
And you didn't know shit from the start.---Lyrics submitted by Shelby.
