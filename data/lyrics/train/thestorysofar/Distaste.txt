Tell me how your lifes played out down south in the sun
Missing school, so you go out every night and try to have fun
And you still deny and try to hide the smoke from your gun
Think Ill slip inside and start making you aim at everyone

Whyd you leave it?
Is it because what I chose?
Can you look in my face and explain why you put
Someone else in my place?
And I dont wanna hear about your trips
And all the time that you waste
No, Id rather not, I hate the thought
Its such a distaste

Ill never match your thievery, as far as this goes
You cant say you never fucked with me cause everyone knows
And why you always poison everything I try to grow?
Calm somehow, but rising now someday Ill let you know

Dont hold much respect for you now
What did you expect to see?
Dont need to accept your ways now
Go be who you want to be---
