There's a sad young wife never had a life.
Her mother says she married young.
And her husband's a fool never listened to
All the things she's never done.
So she packs up that old Ford Fairlane.
She's had about all she can bare.
A suitcase, a hope, and a hard rain.
She's gonna find it all somewhere

On the road
Where the night is black
On the road
Where you don't look back
There's a white line in the distance
Where it's going nobody knows
If it's anywhere you'll find it 
On the road

There's a teenage kid no matter what he did
nobody ever understands.
And he don't measure up and he's had enough.
Can't be his daddy's little man.
So he pulls out that hot rod Chevy.
Puts in his favorite cassette.
Well he ain't going to no college.
The world is waitin' up ahead

On the road
Where the night is black
On the road
Where you don't look back
There's a white line in the distance
Where it's going nobody knows
If it's anywhere you'll find it 
On the road

Eddie and June got time to kill.
The kids they never come around.
And a gold-plated watch
was all he got
when the company shut his life down.
So he takes out that old Airstream.
They don't know where they're bound.
Sixty-five years and still searchin'
for something that they never found.

On the road
Where the night is black
On the road
Where you don't look back
There's a white line in the distance
Where it's going nobody knows
If it's anywhere you'll find it 
On the road
