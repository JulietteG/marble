So that I can hear everything you're sayin. 
Now I know you're goin. 
You just threw this away. 
You know i ain't gonna take it. 
Go Slow. 
You know you ain't gonna make it. 
I know. 
I can't make you stay. 
But I'll be hurtin from the heat. 
Running from the heat. 

Well, well, was it something that I said. 
I know that it was something I said. 
From your heat now. 
I'm going crazy trying hard to forget. 
You know I'm trying to hard forget. 
From your heat now. 
Oh I just wanna go back hold on to the way that I was 
Cuz you took away all my young life. 
And I hate who I've become from your heat now. 
From your heat it's comin, comin. 

I know. 
I'm givin in and believin every lie. 
For now, the moon, it's night. 
I turn off the light. 
But you should put the foundation. 
Go slow. 
Now. 
With your intimidation. 
I know. 
You turn away now I'll be hurt from the heat. 
Heat. 
Running from the Heat.
