I went back to a room 
And every memory came rushing back to soon 
As I packed my bags and I lied down 
I felt the bed sink in and the covers surround 
Cause with my eyes closed I see the door open wide 
And with my eyes closed I'm leaving it all behind 

I...oh, I run away if you call my name 
And I...I'll keep running if you come my away 
And I...oh, I run away if you call my name 
And I...I'll keep running if you come my way 
When you come my way 
I'll keep running if you come my way 

Jumped back in a daze 
I saw the faces [?] slowly slip away 
Let me hide your eyes, it's too bright 
And now I'm slipping through the white 
Bringing me into cold dark night 
And with my eyes closed I see the door open wide 

And with my eyes closed I see the door open 
(I'll keep running if you come my way) 
And with my eyes closed I see the door open 
(I'll keep running if you come my way) 
And with my eyes closed I'm leaving it all behind 

Keep keep running if you call my name 
I'll keep running if you call my name (x6)---
