Forlorn lists in true contempt to destruct and dripping red
Is it time to come clean wash away everything
Hold the frame, still life focus, ones intent to not be noticed
Lost in lies, graceful charms losing touch with everyone
Management, terms and conditions, waiting for own in addition, a contract is raised
The worlds greatest mortuary [sample]
Self destructive mechanism, introvert overturn, assasination, make from steel the ugly weapon, killers instinct, from man to trigger, he carves with knife initials, feel the pain of all initials, at one point decayed from suicide, you nigh is my illusion.
Peaceful time, direct potential. living through ones own dimentia, come on open arms dissect division, caress duress, invite delusion, back moving through the keyhole, trust in keeping a value judgement overthrown, like a somnambulist, twisting and churning in retrospect.
Management, unedible command applicants crime
Self destruct mechanism, introvert overturn, assasination, make from steel the ugly weapon, killers instinct, from man to trigger,
Self destruct mechanism, assassination
The everlasting eternal sleep. [sample]
Secured notes, management, tearms, conditions of such a phase, undone, I can't see.
????? [sample]
Alive, alike, in his eyes.---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
