(My necessary)
(My necessary evil)

Come baby time to play, you know I want it bad, you too
Yeah baby its okay if it drives me mad, cuckoo
Maybe I love it, maybe I need it
Maybe there ain't no other way to try and please me

No matter how it all goes down, I just know I want you now

So don't you, don't you tell me no,
(My necessary evil)
Yeah I'm in control,
(My necessary evil)
Guilty pleasure is a way to go,
(My necessary evil)
So don't you get emotional,
(My necessary evil)

Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)

I should lose these wicked ways, I know this can't be good for you
So tell me that you love these games, you don't mind being used do you?
Maybe I love it, maybe I need it
Maybe there aint no other way to try and please me

Yeah there might be hell to pay, but right now I got it made

So don't you, don't you tell me no,
(My necessary evil)
Yeah I'm in control,
(My necessary evil )
Guilty pleasure is a way to go,
(My necessary evil)
So don't you get emotional
(My necessary evil)

Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)

Take it to the heart or take it to the head
I took it too far, going back on what i said
Feels good till its done, then I'm on the run
I'm dangerous like a loaded gun

So don't you, don't you tell me no,
(My necessary evil)
Yeah I'm in control,
(My necessary evil)
Guilty pleasure is a way to go,
(My necessary evil)
So don't you get emotional,
(My necessary evil)

Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
Baby you ain't nothing but a necessary evil
(My necessary evil)
