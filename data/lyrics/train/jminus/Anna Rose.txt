"He used to be everything to me,"
She said, "I still can't believe he's gone."
It's been so long.

He changed the way she gazed upon life,
Provided something more than money could buy.
His voice was her lullaby.
He still pays her a visit from time to time,
In the ballroom setting of the night.

Sky.
"Do you believe in love at first sight?"
He still says with a smile,
"Dance with me tonight, Anna Rose.
I won't let you go 'til tomorrow."

She waits patiently (for the night to come.)
Holding on to dreams (the way it was.)
Recallin' all the walks to the edge of the sea.
Memories carved into the willow tree.
There are so many things that make her cry,
So she returns to dance, in the night.

Sky.
"Do you believe in love at first sight?"
He still says with a smile,
"Dance with me tonight, Anna Rose.
I won't let you go 'til tomorrow."

She slips away from the world 
That brings her so much pain.
Never seems to change.
She escapes through this dream
Over and over again.

"Do you believe in love at first sight?"
He still says with a smile,
"Dance with me tonight, Anna Rose.
I'll never let you go. See you tomorrow."---Lyrics submitted by Joseph.
