You don't know, that we'd slipped away so slow
Cold I know, as we fall like a final winter snow
Separate alibis, covered in lies
Gave what you could, and you know that I tried
So tell me why, I can't even look in your eyes

I came to you, lost and abused
A little to late and a little to soon
Tried to convince me, tried your best to fix me
But I just kept breaking down
Had something to hold, a reason to smile
I'd ask you to slide and stay for a while
Drift on a chase, falling from grace

But now we only (only) show 
The contempt that will tear us apart
Only only grow, away from the place that we start
Separate alibis, covered in lies
Gave what you could, and you know that I tried
So tell me why, you can't even look in my eyes

Our love has been stolen, the promises broken
All that remains, is not worth the pain
We're facing defeat, in a game we can't cheat
It's not meant to be, but it's so hard to leave
When we began, I never saw the end
Crazy for you, to good to be true
Its not what it seemed, not what we claimed it to be

I wish you well, farewell my friend, I wish you well

Tell me again for we only (only) show 
The contempt that will tear us apart
Only only grow, away from the place that we start
Separate alibis, covered in lies
Gave what you could, and you know that I tried
So tell me why, I can't even look in your eyes---Lyrics submitted by Chad.
