go away give me a chance to miss you
say goodbye itll make me wanna kiss you
i love you so much more when youre not here 
watchin all the bad shows drinkin all of my beer
i dont believe that  ?  spent evey god damn day together
if you give me some room there will be room enough for two

tonight, leave me alone im lonely alone im lonely 
im tired, leave me alone im lonely alone im lonely tonight


i dont wanna wake up with another
but i dont wanna always wake up with you either
no you can hop into my shower 
all i ask for is one fucking hour
you taste so sweet 
but i cant eat
the same thing every day
cut off the phone 
leave me the fuck alone
tomorrow ill be beggin you to come home

tonight, leave me alone im lonely alone im lonely 
im tired, leave me alone im lonely alone im lonely tonight
go away come back go away come back
why cant i just have it both ways
go away come back go away come back
i wish you knew the difference
go away comeback

go away give me the chance to miss you
say goodbye itll make me wanna kiss you(x3)

tonight leave me alone im lonely alone im lonely
im tired leave me alone im lonely alone im lonely tonight(x3)

go away give me the chance to miss you 
say goodbye itll make me wanna kiss you(x3)---Lyrics submitted by Katrina.
