Go damon
Go linda
Go pink
Hahaha yeah
Its me

I might be the way everybody likes to say
I know what youre thinking about me
There might be a day you might have a certain way

But you dont in my luxuries
And its me, I know I know my name
Cuz I say it proud
Everything I want I always do
Lookin for the right track
Always on the wrong track
But all youre catchin are these tracks that im
Layin down for you

Theres a song I was listenin to up all night
Theres a voice I am hearin sayin its alright
When Im happy, Im sad, but everything is good
Its not that complicated Im just missundaztood

There might be a day everything, it goes my way
Cant you think I know Im superfly? 
I might see the world in a world inside of you
Then I just might say goodbye
And its my name I know, I say it loud cuz im
Really proud
Of all the things I used to do
Cuz its the wrong track
Lookin for the right track
And all youre catchin are these tracks that im
Layin down for you

Theres a song I was listenin to up all night
Theres a voice I am hearin sayin its alright
When Im happy, Im sad, but everything is good
Its not that complicated Im just missundaztood

Theres a song I was listenin to up all night
Theres a voice I am hearin sayin its alright
When Im happy, Im sad, but everything is good
Its not that complicated Im just missundaztood

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Lookin for the right track
Always on the wrong track
But all youre catchin are these tracks that im
Layin down for you

Theres a song I was listenin to up all night
Theres a voice I am hearin sayin its alright
I was taken for granted but its all good
Cuz Ill do it again, Im just missundaztood
Said Ill do it again, Im just missundaztood
I said Ill do it again, Im just missundaztood
I said Ill do it again, Im just missundaztood
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh! yeah, yeah, uh! uh! uh! uh! bring it back,
Uh!
