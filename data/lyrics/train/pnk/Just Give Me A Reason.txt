Right from the start you were a thief
You stole my heart and I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep 
Oh oh things you never say to me
Oh oh tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah but this is happening)

You've been havin' real bad dreams 
Oh oh you used to lie so close to me
Oh oh there's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love our love oh our love our love

Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh tear ducts and rust I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean 

Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 

Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent 
And we can learn to love again 

Ooh we can learn to love again 
Ooh we can learn to love again
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again---Lyrics submitted by Sharon Janssen.
