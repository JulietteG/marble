Hey don't cry, the night is almost through
And I'll be here to hold and comfort you
Sometimes you'll look out on dark and stormy skies
But darling remember the sun will always rise 
And bring the light, and bring the light

Life will take you through many endless nights
And you may struggle with pain and loss sometimes
But as long as you are humble
And you stay true inside
Come what may the sun will always rise 
And bring the light, and bring the light

Mountains will make it harder
Dark clouds will make you doubt 
But you'll get through
And when I can't be with you
This ray of hope I give to you 

So hey don't cry, the night is almost through
And I'll be here to hold and comfort you
Though sometimes you'll look out on dark and stormy skies
darling remember, the sun will always rise 
And bring the light, and bring the light---Lyrics submitted by englishman.
