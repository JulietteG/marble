Softly, like a whisper, 
Hold me in your arms.
Everything fades, but you and me
And you know Id cross the stars for your love 
And I think you would go that far.
Bu theres nowhere else Id rather be right now 
Than where you are 

Moonlight, in-between us 
Quiet, lingering 
Lost in your eyes, but I am safe 
You know Id cross the stars for your love 
And I think you would go that far 
But theres nowhere else Id rather be right now 
Than where you are 

Ever so gently 
Hold me in close 
So I can hear you whispering my name 
And you know Id cross the stars for your love 
And I think you would go that far 
But theres nowhere else Id rather be right now 
Than where you are---Lyrics submitted by aNU.
