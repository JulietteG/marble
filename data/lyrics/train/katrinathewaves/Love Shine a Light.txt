Love shine a light, in every corner of my heart
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry
Light up the magic in every little part
Let our love shine a light, in every corner of our hearts

Love shine a light, in every corner of my dreams
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry
Like the mighty river, flowing from the stream
Let our love shine a light, in every corner of my dreams

And we're all gonna shine a light together
All shine a light to light a way
Brothers and sisters, in every little part
Let our love shine a light, in every corner of our hearts

Love shine a light, in every corner of the world
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry
Light up the magic, for every boy and girl
Let our love shine a light, in every corner of the world

And we're all gonna shine a light together
All shine a light to light a way
Brothers and sisters, in every little part
Let our love shine a light, in every corner of our hearts

And we're all gonna shine a light together
All shine a light to light the way
Brothers and sisters, in every little part
Let our love shine a light, in every corner of our hearts ---
