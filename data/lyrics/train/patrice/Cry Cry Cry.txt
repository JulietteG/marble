Bang bang 
I am making a ghost 
When my gun barrel smokes 
Poor thing jumped out of her clothes 
Her body dropped 
Undressing her 
Undressing her soul 
Another girl with a broken heart 
The world jut doesnt need 
Not one more lonely thought 
Singing a sad song 
Im begging please! 
Say 
I do anything ! 

Bang bang 
I am making a ghost 
When my gun barrel smokes 
Poor thing jumped out of her clothes 
Her body dropped 
Undressing her 
Undressing her soul 
Another girl with a broken heart 
The world jut doesnt need 
Not one more lonely thought 
Singing a sad song 
Im begging please! 
Say 
I do anything ! 

Woi woi woi 
Never want to see my girl 
Cry, cry, cry 
No way, no way 

Woi woi woi 
Never want to see my girl 
Cry, cry, cry 
No way, no way 

Woi woi woi 
Never want to see a girl 
Cry, cry, cry 
No way, no way 

Woi, woi, woi 
Rather would I wanna die 
Rather would I wanna die 

Bang, bang 
He was putting her down 
Ice cold like America 
Down 
Poor thing was enjoying the ride 
She thought she was on a mary go 
Round 
Bad boys move in silence girl 
The night is still with no soul around 
So smooth, 
No violence now 
Hush dont make a sound 

Woi woi woi 
Never want to see my girl 
Cry, cry, cry 
No way, no way 

Woi woi woi 
Never want to see a girl 
Cry, cry, cry 
No way, no way 

Woi woi woi 
Never want to see my girl 
Cry, cry, cry 
No way, no way 

Woi, woi, woi 
Rather would I wanna die 
Rather would I wanna die 

Woi woi woi 
Never want to see my girl 
Cry, cry, cry 
No way, no way 

Woi woi woi 
Never want to see a girl 
Cry, cry, cry 
No way, no way 

Woi woi woi 
Never want to see my girl 
Cry, cry, cry 
No way, no way 

Woi, woi, woi 
Rather would I wanna die 
Rather would I wanna die---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
