Chase your shadow blind in an empty room,
Pack your suitcase,
Youve gone too soon,
Midnight walks alone and illusive dreams,
Snakes and ladders not what they seem,

You said keep the faith,
I cant loose it now,
Were in a tightened space,
A room with no way out,
And its sink or swim,
And were drowning,

Take me into the light,
Let me know what it feels like,
Take me into the light,
Let me know what it feels like,

Holding back the tears in your eyes,
Like a phoenix in the ashes want to see you rise,
Dust yourself down its another day,
Take my hand lets pretend it will be okay,

You said keep the faith,
I cant loose it now,
Were in a tightened space,
A room with no way out,
And its sink or swim,
And were drowning,

Take me into the light,
Let me know what it feels like,
Take me into the light,
Let me know what it feels like,

You said keep the faith,
I cant loose it now,
Were in a tightened space,
A room with no way out,
And its sink or swim,
And were drowning.---
