I have waited
 Dined on ashes
 Swung from chandeliers and climbed Everest
 And none of it's got me close to this

I've waited all my life
 If not now, when will I?

We've been good
 Even a blast, but
 Don't you feel like something's missing here?
 Don't you dare

I've waited all my life
 If not now, when will I?
 Stand up and face the bright light
 Don't hide your eyes
 It's time

No umbrellas
 No sunglasses
 Hailing Hallelujah everyday

I've waited all my life
 If not now, when will I?
 Stand up and face the bright light
 Don't hide your eyes
 It's time---Lyrics submitted by JustinHoffman.
