If its good to complicate then both of us are doing fine
Just keep your eyes on your part and leave me alone to mine
If its good to instigate were a fast horse, bet on us
Im not calling you an animal
I think we just fight too much
Come on, in spite of this were doing just fine 
Even diamonds start as coal
Give us time to shine
Even diamonds start as coal
Were both aligned in framed of mind but circumstance has got us good
And now youre seeing a side of me I wished no one ever would
Yeah, if its right to pick a fight, were fingers in a sugar bowl
Love isnt perfect
Even diamonds start out as coal
Hey now, in spite of this were doing just fine 
Even diamonds start as coal
Give us time to shine 
Even diamonds start as coal
Were incomplete and infantine 
Even diamonds start as coal. 
Give it time girl, the fire feels divine
The sweetest things
They burn before they shine
We think way too much 
Look at us losing touch
A promise is a promise until...
Yeah, in spite of this were doing just fine 
Even diamonds start as coal 
Give us time to shine 
Even diamonds starts as coal. 
Were incomplete and infantile 
Even diamonds start as coal---Lyrics submitted by Prime.
