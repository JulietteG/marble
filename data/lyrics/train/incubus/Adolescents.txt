I'm feeling out of bounds, out of bounds.
I'm running out of time, out of time.
I know there's no such thing as either of them, but it doesn't make me feel any better. 

Out of sight, out of mind,
Out of sight, out of mind,
We're out of time,
We're out of mind,
Out of mind, out of mind.
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm feeling overwhelmed, overwhelmed,
It's getting out of line, line, line, line.
I know I'm not alone just adolescents, you and I,
It doesn't make me feel any better.

Out of sight, out of mind,
Out of sight, out of mind,
We're out of time,
We're out of mind,
Out of mind, out of mind.

Yeah (x6) ooooooo

Out of sight, out of mind,
Out of sight, out of mind,
We're out of time,
We're out of mind,
Out of mind, out of mind, 
We're out of line. Yeaaah---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
