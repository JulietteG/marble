I was lost but now I am found.
A line was crossed, a vessel run aground.
The boy has gone, let's grieve and let him go.
He left at dawn, but it's a new day don't you know?

In the company of wolves I sat in silence
observant and afraid

It was there with their eyes like glowing embers
the man you see was made.

I was low but now I am high.
It helps to know serenity from ennui.
Something's wrong, something's wrong, when it all remains the same.
So face the fire, come into your name.

In the company of wolves I sat in silence, observant and afraid.
It was there with their eyes like glowing embers, the man you see was made. Ohhhhhooo..

Even I can't recall how many days I have been out there
For when Aurora's lights ceased to shine, I was alive I think for the first time.
Infinity it falls, in feathery folds but she bites like loveless ice,
and with her belly full she called this rite of passage, it was the longest night of my life.

(It was, it was, it was, it was
It was, it was...

It was the longest night of my life.

(It was, it was, it was, it was
It was, it was, it was...

Even I can't recall how many days I have been out there for
But when Aurora's lights ceased to shine, I was alive, I think, for the first time.
Infinity it falls, in feathery folds but she bites like loveless ice,
and with her belly full she called this rite of passage, it was the longest night of my life.

(It was, it was, it was, it was
It was, it was...

It was the longest night of my life.

(It was, it was, it was, it was
It was, it was, it was... ---Lyrics submitted by Tot Taylor.
