Walking alone tonight
Cause Ive only got room for two.
Me and my burdened black heart,
Its all we know how to do.

Yet I look for a bigger bang
Than the kind I continually see.
Sick of all this inertia,
Oh, wont you mend me?

Lover, can you help me?
Im a child lost in the woods.
A black heart pollutes me
And I think

Youre a mountain that Id like to climb,
Not to conquer, but to share in the view.

Pulled by a false inertia,
Pushed out by circumstance.
Pistol firing at my feet
Thats coercing me to dance.


Yet I look for a bigger bang
Than the kind Im sorry to know.
Here I am, first foot of the climb.
Watch me go.

Lover, can you help me?
Im a child lost in the woods.
A lit path eludes me
And I think

Youre a mountain that Id like to climb,
Not to conquer, but to share in the view.
Youre a bonfire and Im gathered round you.
Set this old black heart inertia aflame.
Send it away (8X)

Youre a mountain that Id like to climb,
Not to conquer, but to share in the view.
Youre a bonfire and Im gathered round you.
Set this old black heart inertia aflame.

Set it aflame, send it away (6X)---Lyrics submitted by migl.
