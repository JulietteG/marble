Nobody gets what you got without getting all hot with the bosses daughter
Taking her out on the town to see up spin around making out with the dress turned upside down
Have a drink what ya think shes all heels and kick bet you thought you landed
Then like a pink Boba Fett she calls you on your bet and your hat is the least of what youre handed

Dance because youre young and you dont need a reason
Dance just like you got your legs from a cartoon
Dance just like youre dumb like you dont need the money
Dance under the moon cuz you never know never know

You were gift with the biz, now youre tired of the risk to the boss mans daughter
You thought singing her praises would get you a raise now youre just like a horse being led through the water
If I come on in take you on the chin is a price worth payin
For a glimpse just a look lets have one of the books
Shes a pink Boba Fett and thats all Im sayin

Dance because youre young and you dont need a reason
Dance just like you got your legs from a cartoon
Dance just like youre dumb like you dont need the money
Dance under the moon cuz you never know never know

Never know, never know
Never know, never know
Like you dont need a reason
Yea you dont need the money
Yea you dont need a reason
Like you dont need the money

Just when you thought you were done cuz you breathe too much fun, now the red lights flashin
She kept a rainbow of pills, she was up on her thrills, both her brains and her body, like, took a bashing
Of course in her mind Im not trying to put it all on her
Put it on who, city boy, take a look its just you, now Im just like a lamb headed to the slaughter

Dance because youre young and you dont need a reason
Dance just like you got your legs from a cartoon
Dance just like youre dumb like you dont need the money---
