Friday night I'm going nowhere 
All the lights are changing green to red 
Turning over TV stations 
Situations running through my head 
Well looking back through time 
You know it's clear that I've been blind 
I've been a fool 
To ever open up my heart 
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule 

Saturday I'm running wild 
And all the lights are changing red to green 
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing 
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream 
Only wish that you were here 
You know I'm seeing it so clear 
I've been afraid 
To tell you how I really feel 
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made 

If you want it 
Come and get it 
Crying out loud 
The love that I was 
Giving you was 
Never in doubt 
Let go your heart 
Let go your head 
And feel it now 

Babylon, Babylon 

Sunday all the lights of London 
Shining , Sky is fading red to blue 
I'm kicking through the Autumn leaves 
And wondering where it is you might be going to 
Turning back for home 
You know I'm feeling so alone 
I can't believe 
Climbing on the stair 
I turn around to see you smiling there 
In front of me 

If you want it 
Come and get it 
Crying out loud 
The love that I was 
Giving you was 
Never in doubt 
And feel it now 
Let go your heart 
Let go your head 
And feel it now 
Let go your heart 
Let go your head 
And feel it now 
Let go your heart 
Let go your head 
And feel it now 
Let go your heart 
Let go your head 
And feel it now---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
