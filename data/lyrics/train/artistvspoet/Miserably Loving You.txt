Another day, another day I decide to
Waste away and contemplate how
Everything has changed.
And though we tried, not to compromise what burns inside
Your complex mind that changes everyday.

These deep breaths repeating
(My heart stops its beating)
And I don't know why these deep breaths repeating
(My heart stops its beating)
The sun has yet to set and you've already said good night.

Emily, please, there's nothing wrong with the way I light up when you're around.
Do anything you want, but don't leave me out.
Emily, please, just get closer to me.

A month went by, a month that I can't describe,
A month I've been trying to push aside and forget in time.
And now we are inches away, but we're miles apart,
So I'll dream of the day and how we felt at the start.
But dreams don't come easy these days,
And the colors, they fade into grays.

These deep breaths repeating
(My heart stops its beating)
She's determined to start a fight.
These deep breaths repeating
(My heart stops its beating)
The sun has yet to set and you're not here to say good night.

Emily, please, there's nothing wrong with the way I light up when you're around.
Do anything you want, but don't leave me out.
Emily, c'mon, this was going somewhere,
I won't let go of what we had
'Cause I'm a broken record that keeps on skipping back.
And I still miss her.

And I never thought that you'd leave me here all on my own.
And I never thought you'd be willing to take away my home.
'Cause there's no one to call and I'm so sick of being all alone.
And I'm stuck miserably loving you.

Emily, please, there's nothing wrong with the way I light up when you're around.
Do anything you want, but don't leave me out...
Emily, please, there's nothing wrong with the way I light up when you're around.
Do anything you want, but don't leave me out.
Emily, c'mon, this was going somewhere,
I won't let go of what we had.
Now I'm a broken record that keeps on skipping back.
Emily, please, just get closer to me.---Lyrics submitted by Zoey.
