Im just about ready to give up on you
(One more fight)
And i will be through with you
A change that i would not have expected to occur
And every time that I 
(Look at you)
Im reminded of what
(We have been through)
This routine has become so tiring 
(Im at a loss for words)

Cause its so hard, so hard 
When you have lost control 
It was never as easy as it was before you and i lost touch
This might sounds crazy 
(But i don't know)
How to let you go 
Its hard to keep on fighting 
When all you know is loosing 

Let me tell you how its been these 2 weeks have been a living hell
Overcoming the fact that this would never be
(Dont tell me it was that easy)
To give up on something that you never fought for

Cause its so hard, so hard 
When you have lost control 
It was never as easy as it was before you and i lost touch
This might sounds crazy 
(But i don't know)
How to let you go 
Its hard to keep on fighting 
When all you know is loosing 

Maybe we could 
(Take some time)
To think about what we should do
And maybe we could take some time 
To think about 

I would have said that we could have had the best of times
Have changed since you and me lost that something we had 

Cause its so hard, so hard 
When you have lost control 
It was never as easy as it was before you and i lost touch
This might sounds crazy 
(But i don't know)
How to let you go 
Its hard to keep on fighting 
When all you know is loosing---
