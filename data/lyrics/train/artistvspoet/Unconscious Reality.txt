lay down and watch the sun come up
don't know how long it's been since my eyes were shut
and they're burning, i'm twisting, and turning
a lonely night, a tired morning

i'm isolated, awake at five am
unmotivated, unplugging the clock again
i lose track of when this day ends and the next one begins
so eventually..

i'll take another pill to fall asleep
and slip into unconscious reality
i slowly fade away and begin this dream
where the pieces fit so easily

i walk around like an outcast to all the lights and sounds,
losing grip of everything
i daze away and dream more in the day
wasting time losing sleep, i can't escape
i'll make it somehow, i'm not sure
just how that may be
i'll fake it 'till i find a cure,
i'll just assume for now i'll have to..

take another pill to fall asleep
and slip into unconscious reality
i slowly fade away and begin this dream
where the pieces fit so easily

i'm never really awake
but i'm not asleep, no i'm not asleep
i slowly fade away and begin this dream
where the pieces fit so easily

and don't wake please wake me up
('cause i'm not here to answer)
and don't wake, please wake me up
(can't you hear my pleading?)

i'll make it somehow, i'm not sure
i'll just assume for now i'll have to..

take another pill to fall asleep
and slip into unconscious reality
i slowly fade away and begin this dream
where the pieces fit so easily

i'm never really awake
but i'm not asleep, no i'm not asleep
i try to fade away and begin this dream
where the pieces fit so easily

i'm never really awake
but i'm not asleep, no i'm not asleep
i try to fade away and begin this dream
where the pieces fit so easily

(woah oh oh, woah oh oh-oh
woah oh oh, woah oh oh)---Lyrics submitted by Zoey.
