It happened again,
You're afraid to open up or just give in
'Cause someone's gonna hurt you
Like you've been in the past
Heal the wounds, be broken glass,
Now you're jaded but please don't fade away

If you only knew how much you made me feel alive
Where do we go
How do we find ourselves
When this world brings so much pain
And how do we cope with the things we hate?
(The things that made us feel this way)

Oh girl, can't you see
The effect you have on me
And I'm not the only one
You stay inside, try to hide, just deny
Those who just want to make you smile

If you only knew how much you made me feel alive
Where do we go
How do we find ourselves
When this world brings so much pain
And how do we cope with the things we hate
(The things that made us feel this way)

How do we know when it's alright to take
The jump and not look back
We may never know,
That's what makes this life worth living
Taking chances, loving, giving yourself away

And woah, woah-oh
I can't stand this to see this state you're in
And no, no, oh
I want to make your fears all go away
'Cause you make me weak every single day

Where do we go
How do we find ourselves
When this world brings so much pain
And how do we cope with the things we hate
(The things that made us feel this way)

How do we know when it's alright to take
The jump and not look back
We may never know
That's what makes this life worth living
Taking chances, loving, giving yourself away
Giving yourself away---
