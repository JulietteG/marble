(I'm broke, but I'm not broken)
Like the mirror I stare into
Distorting my own view of how I see myself,
So untraceable to everybody else.
Shattered pieces fell as I tell myself
That everything is alright
As I stand here left with nothing.
I'm broke, but I'm not broken.

Like the mirror, that's my rear view
Distorting my own views of how I see myself,
It's not erasable, I'm miserable as hell.
As the pages turn, I begin to learn
That I have every reason to resent myself.
I'm broke, but I'm not broken.

Don't take this away, 'cause I need it.
And I can't let go of this feeling.
And these walls, they fall and my time is
Slipping further, I can't fight it.

I stand outside of my front porch and look at photographs of when
Things seemed simpler.
But I pushed away, so this is where I am
At a different place where I lost track
And everything's not alright.
So I'll stand here left with nothing.
I'm broke, but I'm not broken.

Don't take this away, 'cause I need it.
And I can't let go of this feeling.
And these walls, they fall and my time is
Slipping further, I can't fight it.

I'm holding on to what I know,
Don't wanna change.
I may be wrong, but after every word that's spoken,
I'm broke, but I'm not broken.

I'm holding on to what I know,
Don't wanna change.
I may be wrong, but after every word that's spoken...
I'm not broken. (na nana na)
I'm not broken. (na nana na)
I'm not broken. (na nana na)
But after every word that's spoken,
I'm broke, but I'm not broken.---
