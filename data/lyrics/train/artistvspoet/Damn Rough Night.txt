Its gonna be a damn rough night
For the designated driver
'Cause it's me and whoever
And you know we won't remember
Sorry for what I'm about to do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through

Before we take a drink let's toast
To the "never have I ever"s
'Cause tonight is the night
That we'll talk about forever
So take my keys and hide my cell phone
If I turn into trouble, at least I warned you

Let's recap and get caught up
No one said enough's enough
I let go the better part of me

I guess I had a damn rough night
I'm still piecing it together
There's a girl in my bed
And I haven't even met her

I had a damn rough night
And I can't even remember
Threw my clothes in the fire
and I turned into a streaker

Sorry for what I'm about to do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
All these crazy things we do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through

I heard I was a big chaotic mess at the occasion
Was a total disaster and now I'm fading faster
I'll keep the score never realized
So I pass the time until I feel alive
and I am not like this all the time

Let's recap and get caught up
No one said enough's enough
I let go the better part of me

I guess I had a damn rough night
I'm still piecing it together
There's a girl in my bed
And I haven't even met her

I had a damn rough night
And I can't even remember
Threw my clothes in the fire
And I turned into a streaker

Sorry for what I'm about to do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
All these crazy things we do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through

And if I had the chance
You know Id do it all again
(Id do it all again)
And if I had the chance
You know I'd do it all again

Looks like I had a damn rough night
I'm still piecing it together
There's a girl in my bed
And I haven't even met her

They say I had a damn rough night
And I can't even remember
Threw my clothes in the fire
And I turned into a streaker

Sorry for what I'm about to do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
All these crazy things we do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through

Sorry for what I'm about to do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
All these crazy things we do
Turning 21 is a bitch to go through
Is a bitch to go through---Lyrics submitted by Zoey.
