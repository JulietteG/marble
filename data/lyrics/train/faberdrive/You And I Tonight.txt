Tonight, a candle lights the room
Tonight, its only me and you
Your skin like gravity
Is pulling every part of me
I fall, you and I collide

and what if I stay forever
What if there's no goodbye
Frozen for a moment here in time, yeah
If you tell me the sky is falling
We'll see that the stars collide
The only thing that matters in my life
Is you and i tonight

Our eyes close, the candle burns away
But I know the fire still remains
This love is all we need
We fit together perfectly
I fall, you and I collide

and what if I stay forever
What if there's no goodbye
Frozen for a moment here in time, yeah
If you tell me the sky is falling
I'll see that the stars collide
The only thing that matters in my life
Is you and I tonight

I wanna see this through
I'm gonna give it all to you

Tonight a candle lights the room
Tonight it's only me and you

and what if I stay forever
What if there's no goodbye
Frozen for a moment here in time, yeah
If you tell me the sky is falling
We'll see that the stars collide
The only thing that matters in my life
Is you and i tonight (Tell me to stay forever)
Just you and I tonight (Tell me to stay forever)
Just you and I tonight---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
