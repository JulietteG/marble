i count down the days,
until we say goodbye,
i wish there was a way,
that i could just stop time,
forever, remember,
summer nights we've spent together,
on my car , counting stars,
just wishing i, 

could stay,
(i know we only met a month ago)
with you 
(it's always hard to let the feelings go)
when summer fades to fall
(whoa, whoa)
i'd stay 
(i should have known that this would come and go)
with you
(and now we'll only get the afterglow)
when summer fades to fall
(whoa, whoa)

far away from you, only time will tell
when you're back in school, will you meet someone else
remember, forever
summer nights we've spent together
holding hands, making plans
just wishing i, 

could stay
(i know we only met a month ago)
with you 
(it's always hard to let the feelings go)
when summer fades to fall
(whoa, whoa)
i'd stay 
(i should have known that this would come and go)
with you
(and now we'll only get the afterglow)
when summer fades to fall
(whoa, whoa)

everytime i think of you
i don't wanna face the truth
why wait forever knowing
we may never follow through
guess i should get over you
but i can't let go soon
i'll wait forever knowing 
we may never follow through
(i'll wait forever just for you)

i count down the days,
until we say goodbye,
i wish there was a way,
that i could just stop time,
just wishing i, 

could stay
(i know we only met a month ago)
with you 
(it's always hard to let the feelings go)
when summer fades to fall
(whoa, whoa)
when summer fades to fall
(whoa, whoa)
when summer fades to fall
(whoa, whoa)

(yeah, yeah, yeah,)

i should have known that this would come and go,
and now we only get the afterglow
when summer fades to fall---Lyrics submitted by Mikolaj.
