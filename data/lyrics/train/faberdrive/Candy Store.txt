I can't wait another night to see you
Gotta satisfy my sweet tooth 
A little like reeses fallin' into pieces
Tell me there's a way to do this
I just wanna kiss your hot lips
girl you make me melt like chocolate 
Jaw breaker you got the kiss and I wanna savour

oh [x4]
Life saver you're my life saver
oh [x4]
You got the love with the thousand flavours

oh [x4] and I really want more oh [x4]
I know your love is such a sugar rush and I can never get enough
I'm like oh [x4] and I really want more oh [x4]
yeah honey you're the sweetest thing I've ever seen before
I'm like a kid in a candy store 

Baby I'm love sick
I just gotta get my next fix
Pour a little sugar on this 
heart breaker 
You be the dough and I'll be the baker
Mr. Christie never knew
a recepie as hot as you
You're Rihanna I'm Eminem
Melts in your mouth, not in your hands 

oh [x4]
Life saver you're my life saver
oh [x4]
You got the love, you got the good flavour

oh [x4] and I really want more oh [x4]
I know your love is such a sugar rush and I can never get enough
I'm like oh [x4] and I really want more oh [x4]
yeah honey you're the sweetest thing I've ever seen before
I'm like a kid in a candy store 

How you doin' sugar
You're sweeter than dessert nice to meet you
The name is Ish, I'll admit it I gotta sweet tooth
But that's ight, I promise that I won't bite
Girl, unless that's something that you're into
I'm playin', I'm sayin' you're with it in the song
And there ain't no competition
You're in a league of your own
Gotcha hooked soon as I get you alone
You could bet that
Now break me off a piece of that kit-kat

I can't wait another night to see you
Gotta satisfy my sweet tooth
Life saver you're my life saver
You got the kiss with the thousand flavours

oh [x4] and I really want more oh [x4]
I know your love is such a sugar rush and I can never get enough
I'm like oh [x4] and I really want more oh [x4]
yeah honey you're the sweetest thing I've ever seen before
I'm like a kid in a candy store 

oh [x4] and I really want more oh [x4]
I know your love is such a sugar rush and I can never get enough
I'm like oh [x4] and I really want more oh [x4]
yeah honey you're the sweetest thing I've ever seen before
I'm like a kid in a candy store---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
