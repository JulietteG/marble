(feat. Swoope and Trip Lee)

[Intro:]
Its goin down
[repeat]

Hey, I know you think you the one, homie
But cant nobody escape Gravity

[Verse 1 (Trip Lee):]
Yes sir, its about to go down
Its spiralin to the ground, but I dont think its gon slow down
This fallen world is fallin, this buildings bout to blow down
We just goin in circles, we dont get another go round
(Its goin down) What happens when your life is leveled, bro?
A storm is comin, cant nobodys levies hold,
Its heavy, bro, but I gotta let you know
Itll help you look beyond this world like a telescope
(Itd be easy) Yeah, stack your money in the air
Til its rainin hundeds all around your atmosphere
(Itd be easy) You can build a mansion sky high
Til cant nobody see the roof when they drive by
But deathll hit you like a drive by
And to that stuff you acquired you gotta say Bye, bye
I aint gon lie, you might go down in history
But everything will go down eventually
Everything is falling (down)

[Hook:]
Everything is falling down, down, down.
Its goin down
Its goin down
I see the sky fallin
Its goin down
And aint no way to solve it
Its goin down
I hear the Lord calling

[Verse 2 (Swoope):]
Its goin down, rather comin down wit it
Cold world, condition is sin, here is the illness
Its sickenin, affliction so erotic, sickness so hypnotic
Desirin this virus even though we know its toxic
Godless, hallowin the gods that is counterfeit
We live from de party o de dearly departed
The darkness is flowing from my nostrils
Were so psychotic, we still partyin like we not sick
YOLO, homie, so pour another glass
Roll another one up, lets put on another mask
Another bundle o cash, another shorty to bag,
Same thing eeryday, groundhog under grass
Man, turn the music up cuz I dont wanna hear the truth
Bout the things Im living fo is dead and Im the living proof
Shoot, the skys fallin, aint no need to panic
Unless we party til it cracks, seeing Jesus standin
Coming down

[Hook]

You scared, Im not
Theres a time for everything,
A time to be born and a time to die
Theres a time when the world as we know it will end
When that is, I dont know
But it is goin down

[Verse 3 (Lecrae):]
Listen, its goin down, down, down holla Mayday!
Them fiends looking for candy and them dealers got that pay day
I seen them child soldiers; they was loading up some AK's
Aint playin Modern Warfare. Don't you know aint a war fair?
Scales are never even, but they be triple beamin
They keep them fiends fienin, the Devil stay scheming
And dreamers steady dreamin, but aint no hope here
Aint no satisfaction in money, women, and clothes here
Oh yeah! Them Christians in Christian Audigier
Hey, can't some young men say the stuff we gotta say
Cause everything is fallen, it could happen any day
Your world come tumbling down and aint no way to get away
You aint never gon say you aint hear it from Lecrae
If I die before I wake I pray to the Lord your soul He'll take
All these drunken nights are empty like the bottles that we break
And you can't get high enough to escape
It's going down!
