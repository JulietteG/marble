Come on everybody sit down
People wanna act like they are in and out
Well I'm here to wipe off your smile
And tell you what's the word around town
I know you don't wanna hear the truth
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof
But I just need you to believe
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly

Remember back in '02
When I was in school and actin' a fool
My soul got saved, my debt had been paid
But still I kept running off on my crew
Sex on my brain, and death in my veins
Had a main thing, we stayed up 'til 2 (Smoke!)
Waking and thinking we naked, my body was loving it
Soul was hating it, man
Time and time after time, our bodies were close
The girl was so fine
Heard a heart beat that wasn't hers or mine
The miracle of life had started inside
Ignored the warning signs
Supressed that truth I felt inside
I was just having fun with this, I'm too young for this
I'm thinking me, myself, and I
Should I sacrifice this life to keep my vanity and live nice?
And she love and trust me so much that whatever I say, she'd probably oblige
But I was too selfish with my time
Scared my dreams were not gonna serve
So I dropped her off at that clinic
That day, a part of us died

Come on everybody sit down
People wanna act like they are in and out
Well I'm here to wipe off your smile
And tell you what's the word around town
I know you don't wanna hear the truth
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof
But I just need you to believe
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly

I remember back in the day
I was barely in the first grade
Got teeth missing, watching Tom & Jerry
Tryna go outside so I could play
I was told to watch out for strangers
Keep my eyes out for danger
Folks workin' late, I had a babysitter
I ain't 'bout to sit here and name her
I was almost 8, when she came in late
Woke me up with a game to play
Did a few things that's hard to say
Told me to keep that secret safe
How a young boy supposed to deal
I'm tryna act like it ain't real
Had my innocence just stripped from me
I still don't know how to feel
And I'm wondering how to address it
Can't tell my family, too messy
So I just embrace it, it's hard to face it
I'm too ashamed to confess it
So I kept it in and ain't speak
Can't think, it hit me so deep
So into it, I got promiscuous
And only God can help me get free
But I've been forgiven, my Savior risen
I'm out the prison, I know that
I got the power to say to no to all of my struggles
God will control that
Every time we slip and we fall
Gotta get back up and fight on
We are not defined by our past
The future look bright, I see the light on

Come on everybody sit down
People wanna act like they are in and out
Well I'm here to wipe off your smile
And tell you what's the word around town
I know you don't wanna hear the truth
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof
But I just need you to believe
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly---
