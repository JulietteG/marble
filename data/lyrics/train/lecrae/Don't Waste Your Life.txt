Lets Go
Don't waste your life man
I know a lot of people that are scared they gonna die,
Covered up on thinking Ill be livin in the sky,
While Im here living man I gotta ask why,
What am I here for I gotta figure out,
Waste my life, no I gotta make it count,
If Christ is real then what am I gon do about,
Everything in Luke 12:15 down to 21 ya really gotta go and check it out,
Paul said if Christ aint resurrected we wasted our lives,
But that implies that all lifes built around is Jesus being alive,
Gotta keep on living, gotta show the world why,
Christ is more than anything Id ever try,
Tryin to pretty women and sinning and living to get a minute of every woman there that you admire,
It aint no lie!
We created for Him,
Out of the dust he made us for Him,
Elects us and he saved us for Him,
Jesus comes and he raised us for Him,
To magnify the Father, wont bother with something lesser,
He made us so we could bless Him,
To the world we confess Him,
Resurrects Him,
So I know I got life,
Matter fact better man I know I got Christ,
If you dont see His ways in my days in my nights,
You can hit my breaks you can stop my lights,
Then I lost my rights, cost my life,
Forget the money, cars and toss that ice,
The cost is Christ,
They can never offer me anything any better that would cost that price,

(Chorus): Dont want to waste my life, life, life,
Dont want to waste my life, life, life,
Dont want to waste my life, life, life,
Dont want to waste my,
Dont want to waste my, (x2)
Dont want to waste my life 

Oh, check it, listen,
Armed and dangerous
So the devil jus can't handle us
Christian youth them a stand wid us
Livin' n driven, given a vision, fullfillin the commission he handed us
London to Los Angeles
The rap evangelist
Ma daddy wouldn't abandon us
"I gotta back pack fulla tracts plus I keep a Johnny Mac"
So are you ready to jam with us
So lets go, gimme the word an lets go
Persecution lets go
Tribulation lets go
Across the nation lets go
Procrastination bes go
Hung on the cross in the cold
Died for da young and the old
Can't say you never know
Heaven knows
How many souls are going to hell or to heaven so we gotta go in and get em

(chorus)

Suffer, yea, ya do it for Christ,
Youre trying to figure out what to do with ya life,
Ya make a lot of money hope your doin it right,
Because the money is Gods you better steward it right,
And stay focused, you aint got no ride,
Your life aint wrapped up in what you drive,
The clothes you wear, the job your work,
The color your skin, nah youre Christian first,
People get to living for a job,
Make a little money start living for a car,
Get em a wife, a house, kids and a dog,
Then they retire, they living high on the hog,
But guess what they didnt ever really live at all,
To live is Christ, and thats Paul I recall,
To die is gain so for Christ we give it all,
He is the treasure youll never find in a mall,
See your money, your singleness, marriage, talent, your time,
Theyve been loaned you to show the world that Christ is divine,
Thats why its Christ in my rhymes,
Thats why its Christ all the time,
See my whole world is built around Him,
Hes the life in my lines,
I refuse to waste my life,
Hes too true to chase that ice,
Heres my gift to time,
Cuz im constantly tryin be used to praise the Christ,
If Hes truly raised to life, 
Then this news should change your life ,
And by His grace you can put your faith in the place that rules your days and nights,
YES!
