(feat. For King & Country)

Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers

We've been given a call
Been forgiven, risen
We livin' to give him our all
Rise up from your past
That's holding you down
This moment is all that matters
The future is now
How will the people know if we don't tell 'em?
If we fail 'em
They're stumbling in the dark
But the lighters that we carryin'
Don't have to wonder your purpose
Or what you're here for
Reflect his image
And show the world what he cares for

And I know it's all right
And you know it's your life
And we know that time's running out
Can't wait around cause

Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers

I've been a lot of places where the scene ain't pretty
I've seen plenty of hate, death and destruction
Where ignorance kills many
The blind leading the blind
We turnin' a blind eye
That alone is a crime
We've got the power to life
I know that we make mistakes
Don't let 'em keep you away
Mercy, love, and His grace
The reason we movin' here
Speak out
Though we've never been qualified to do it
I ain't earned it
I was loved into it
I'm brand new

And I know it's all right
And you know it's your life
And we know that time's running out
Can't wait around cause

Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers---
