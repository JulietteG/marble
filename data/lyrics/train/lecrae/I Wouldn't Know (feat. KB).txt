I'm living like you should wanna know what I know
Remember this, you will always reap what you sow
Gotta keep it real, hold it down on the low
Never been fearin' nah nah nah nah
So I wouldn't know
I wouldn't know
I wouldn't know
(I wouldn't, I wouldn't)
I wouldn't know
(I wouldn't, wouldn't)

They say I'm going out my head right now
They say I'm gonna fail right now (right now)
Maybe you were countin' bands all night
Trappin' out the band all night
I wouldn't know
You ain't runnin' the streets you just runnin' your mouth I don't hear what they speak (I don't hear you)
I just walk like I talk I got that light to my ... and ... to my feet
But the feeling so sweet
Got me feeling like a beast
A sickness ain't got us more witness for the foreign car making my pockets pretentious, Lord
Somebody Help me
I'd have seen things I don't wanna see
I'm out running through the streets
Heard somebody calling me saying we should meet
But I wouldn't Know
Yea they probably talking 'bout me
Probably ... saying that they doubt me
Keep the ... 'round me
Father, keep me grounded
I wouldn't Know 'cuz I never be around them, No

Hundred bands, you got a hundred grand, hundred grand
That is easy a scholarship
You'd rather go the club and blow all of it
I don't wanna judge, but you won't get your honor yeah
We don't care what you did on the gram
Boy, you aborted the mission and I got the sonogram
Haven't you, haven't you noticed
Rappers they flex on the place they come from
They brag that they eat, while we got no groceries
American Dreams
Barely Americans really do dream
That couldn't leave, heritage we
...
Start from the bottom and never do leave, geez
I am for the people you are for the paper
Breakin' cycles, make disciples that's all that I do
...

I'm living like you should wanna know what I know
Remember this, you will always reap what you sow
Gotta keep it real, hold it down on the low
Never been fearin' nah nah nah nah
So I wouldn't know
I wouldn't know
I wouldn't know
(I wouldn't, I wouldn't)
I wouldn't know
(I wouldn't, wouldn't)---
