Hair check, shoes check, 
brand new fit looking cool check, 
looking in mirror like "ooooh yes!" 
cover for an insecure dude check, She won't feel me and they wont like me if I ain't in them J's or them brand new Nikes,lets dig deeper inside my pysche
when it's all said and done even I don't like me
He live in the gym and his hair stay faded
late model car so they think he made it
he's Christian he gave his life
but he still ain't satisfied in the savior Christ
still finds his identity in looks and cars
if he only knew that he ain't have to look so hard
If looked in God it may seem odd he be so satisfied he could leave it all.

[ Chorus ]
I'm not the shoes I wear, I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm am not the house I live in, I'm not the car I drive
I'm not the job I work, You can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth, my identity is found in Christ.

How do I gauge success,Why do I say I'm blessed,
Huh,Is it the car that I drive or the place that I rest or the way that I dress, 
now Is the cause of my pride, 
the stage and the set or my face in the press, 
now Cause the applause it dies
When the praise is less if my face is depressed, 
then/It's cause my value and worth is in the volume of the work I produce in the booth 
It's a prize and a curse if defined by the perks when the truth is through
Man I'm goin' feel like I don't want to live no more, no more, no more
Cause they don't like me like they did in 04,04,04
So, I swallow my pride empowered by God, 
I'm complete in Him
He's got peace God's priest I'm in In 
His presence weak-His strength
Meet His kin We His brethren Read this list 
Me forgiven 
He's dismissed guilt and my sin and
I find my worth cause I'm Jesus' friend

[ Chorus ]
I'm not the shoes I wear, I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm am not the house I live in, I'm not the car I drive
I'm not the job I work, You can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth, my identity is found in Christ.

Got her hair done, toes and nails
is that Her? well it's hard to tell
cause she's so caked up in so much make up
It's like she's tryna make up for what she ain't 
but she's a saint but so confused
cause she's been rejected by all these dudes
they tell her on a scale of 10 she's a two
but that ain't true if she only knew
In Christ she is loved she secure and accepted
never be rejected by God who's elected her 
Her beauty is her Godliness
And she ain't gotta flaunt it cause it's obvious 
[ Identity is found in the God we trust
Any other identity will self destruct.x2 ]

[ Chorus ]
I'm not the shoes I wear, I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm am not the house I live in, I'm not the car I drive
I'm not the job I work, You can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth, my identity is found in Christ.---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.
