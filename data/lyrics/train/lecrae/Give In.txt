(feat. Crystal Nicole)

Im giving it all away
No more hiding
No more stallin'
I hear you calling' me
And Im coming
See me running
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)

I try but I just cant keep this thing to myself
Look tire low, and I know ain't nobody else
But Im focused now and I know its all about you
You always see me through that what you do
Tell me
Tell me where would I go, where would I be?
Love is hard to find but you blind and loosing your way
And now aint nobody else for me, its just you
You got my time, all the time, anytime, my minds on you

Im giving it all away
No more hiding
No more stallin'
I hear you calling' me
And Im coming
See me running
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)

They laugh at me and say Im going too far
But its satisfying my soul to give you my all
They dont understand what I got its so real
They can talk about me, they can kick me out, but cant take away what you give
People telling me that Im probably too far gone
But they dont understand where I been and they walk the roads that Ive walked on
Tell me who Im gon call on
Whose solid ground can I fall on
You everything that I never dreamed youd give to me and its all on you
You know you got me deep off in this thing Im all in
I swear aint no love like this love that Ive been given
I cant resist its just too much your love is endless
And I dont care what they say no more no way I give in you

Its time to cut the cord
Sever the ties from the life before
From here on out Im yours
I cant run no more
Cause youre pulling me in
Like a tornado wind
And I cant pretend
I try leaving
But your love so strong
And it wont let go
Youre holding on to me

Im giving it all away
No more hiding
No more stallin'
I hear you calling' me
And Im coming
See me running
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
I give in (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)
You win (uh oh oh, uh oh oh)---
