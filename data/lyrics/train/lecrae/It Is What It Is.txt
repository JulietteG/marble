Im hearin screams and they sayin we sold out
But Im hearin screams from the stands cause we sold out [its so loud!]
Ive got one life so I spend time tryna live till the next one
If you dont like it, boo
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
My plate too full to sample that dish
It is what it is
It is what it is
Im handling biz, it is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is

Some like I aint really feeling that bro
I aint with religious rap, bro
Some say it is devil rap
Illuminati-on-another-level rap
Fell flat from heaven went to hell and back, huh?
A lot of radio aint giving no play
But its OK
Cause my day 1s been A-1
Before the co-signs and the pros came [uh!]
Where you been been boy boy?
You aint been keeping up
Church Clothes 1 and 2 and Anomaly mmm
Prolly need to turn your speakers up
And now Im on my third tape
And I just might drop it on a Thursday
So tell the industry and my enemy
That your man wouldnt follow in they rules in the first place [yeah]
Thirty plus in the residential
In the truck feelin presidential
With my girl lookin detrimental
Killing anything
Tryin to be a side piece
Out my mental
Outta your mind
You thinkin Im leavin my baby by marchin for dimes?
You get that curve
You way out of line!
Gave her that rock
Im stayin with mine
I keep the huddle mad tight
Too many players I dont trust now
You wasnt with me on the 4th down? [huh?]
Then you can miss me when I touchdown
And thats no shade, no shade
Its just those games, I dont play
Im gettin wiser with more age
And realizin some gonna hate
And thats OK

Im hearin screams and they sayin we sold out
But Im hearin screams from the stands cause we sold out [its so loud!]
Ive got one life so I spend time tryna live till the next one
If you dont like it, boo
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
My plate too full to sample that dish
It is what it is
It is what it is
Im handling biz, it is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is

Hold up
Let me get a minute from the flexin
Foreign cars and the million dollar jets and
Futuristic clothes feelin like a Jetson
Cause keep it trill, it aint really that impressive
Blessed, but I aint frontin with the Grammys or the fame
Im just stuntin with my family unashamed
And cats say Crae, you done got it all
In the gym working hard, you should show it off!
Nah, that aint never been my forte
Pride come before the fall what the Word say
And Ive been eatin off the wordplay
Working hard on the lyrics that the world play
Remember where I came from in the first place
Its all a gift
Every breath is a birthday
So I spend time tryna find all of these souls lost
Cause its a wasted time if I got it all and they souls lost
I aint tryin to ball
If thats what you feel then your goals off
Its a different game tryna get this Truth
Put you on and then go off
So yeah I may swag at award shows
Get some jet lag from a tour show
Keep a couple abs on my torso
But none of that is gonna matter when the horn blow
I aint trying to front
But them flashin lights, man they had us
Life is a gift
So if last night was my last night them Im good
It is what it is

Im hearin screams and they sayin we sold out
But Im hearin screams from the stands cause we sold out [its so loud!]
Ive got one life so I spend time tryna live till the next one
If you dont like it, boo
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
My plate too full to sample that dish
It is what it is
It is what it is
Im handling biz, it is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is---
