Never been no one to waste time
Keep that beat like a drummer on a bass line
No momma tryna hit me with the waistline
She don't see I got my lady on FaceTime
I'm unashamed, can't stop that
You feelin' like a hater, please stop that
They say "hold up 'fore you drop that"
I'ma do it, pull the top back
I was six, top down
Four fours, block now
I'ma do me, let the crics gon talk now
Writing with a kuckle, not worrying 'bout what my left hand doin'
How you gon worry about what the next man doing

Lock 'em ...
In the sky where I gon go
They throwing shade but it's cool though
I'ma do me and we on the same team
Yeah, watch how I'm doing me
I can't do you, cause I'm doing me
Yeah, I know they feel how I'm doing me
But they gon get a thrill how I'm doing me

They call me E-40 but not the signal brush
Got my name from trigger 40s, used to rush
Cars cookin' cookin' them jelly jars
Yeah you ...
Now I'm getting a microphone profit
Lookin like a got sandbags in my pocket
Maybe I'm on boots but it's too late
She hungry to her I look like a plate
Let me be straight up
You need to get your weight up
Stop worrying about the next get your ...
When my money was low I stayed high
With my chin in the sky, do or die

Lock 'em ...
In the sky where I gon go
They throwing shade but it's cool though
I'ma do me and we on the same team
Yeah, watch how I'm doing me
I can't do you, cause I'm doing me
Yeah, I know they feel how I'm doing me
But they gon get a thrill how I'm doing me

They hopin' I keep it cookin' and keep it poppin'
The studio the kitchen, we mixing up the product
Got couple critics, couple haters, never stoppin'
Me and Gawvi talkin', he told me not to bother
I got a master plan from the Master
So let 'em talk about me while I'm looking crazy dancing
My clothes don't matching and my holes got pants
Wait, I think a man said it backwards
It's cool though, how you do that there?
Acting like nobody know what you do back there
... I know it's you back there
I ain't dwelling on it, I ain't tryna do that there

Lock 'em ...
In the sky where I gon go
They throwing shade but it's cool though
I'ma do me and we on the same team
Yeah, watch how I'm doing me
I can't do you, cause I'm doing me
Yeah, I know they feel how I'm doing me
But they gon get a thrill how I'm doing me---
