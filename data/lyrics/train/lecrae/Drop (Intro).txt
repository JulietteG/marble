"The Drop (Intro)"

Turn the music up inside my session
These folks gotta hear my message
You put that beat on, I beat on this track to relieve my stressin
I see more trials than Cochran, while TV tryna box me
Them magazines ain't on my page, but aint none of that gon stop me
Keep the fame and acclaim, I wont be a slave for a chain
And why stay the same for the change, lets talk bout change for a change
Mundane, killa bang, sell cane for the gain, pump vanity in your veins
No, they hopin I quit, fact they hopin I die, no, they hopin I'm plain insane
Cause they know I ain't playing, got my faith on display
And I got some ridas behind me, and they mean what they saying
Knock, knock. Open up. We at yo door. Hope you prepared now
And I think it's clear now, potna we here now
And don't plan on goin no where, consider yoself infested
And these strings all up in yo veins, consider yoself infected
And what we say we live out, fo we give in we give out
And when we die we come back, tell Death hell never win out
They ain't never stop us, pop us, drop us, watch us pop right back up
And we never gone die, thats why we ride & rise like Pac got back up
Gon back up, call back up, everybody go home, just pack up
We plugged into the Highest power, that why we ain't gotta act tough
No poker faces, just smokin aces, my house is full
My temple is a dwelling place, my Masters masterful
You just full of yoself, you just food on the shelf
Eaten for breakfast, talkin reckless ,boy I know the chef
You dont want hes cookin, its not easy to stomach
And your words will be eaten, folksll be readin yo vomit
The recipe for disaster asks for blasphemy
And as for me, ask for me, I give you gravity---Lyrics submitted by Jose Jimenez.
