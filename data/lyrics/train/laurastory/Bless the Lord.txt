You give and take away, for my good
For who am I to say, what I need
For you alone see, the hidden parts of me
That need to be stripped away

And as you begin, to refine
I'm learning to let go, and rely
On one who walks with me, as hard as it may be
You're teaching me all the while to say

Bless the Lord, oh my soul
All that is in me bless your name
Forget not your power untold
Not your glory or your fame
For you came to heal the broken
To redeem and make me whole
Bless the Lord, oh my soul

Lord you give and take away, for my good
For who am i to say, what i need
For you alone see, the hidden parts of me
That need to be stripped away

And as you begin, to refine
I'm learning to let go, and rely
On one who walks with me, as hard as it may be
You're teaching me all the while to say

Bless the Lord, oh my soul
All that is in me bless your name
Forget not your power untold
Not your glory or your fame
For you came to heal the broken
To redeem and make me whole
Bless the Lord, oh my soul

Though my faith may falter, my strangth may fail
I pray for eyes to see
The richness of your mercy shown to me

Bless the Lord, bless the Lord
Bless the Lord, oh my soul
All that is in me bless your name
Forget not your power untold
Not your glory or your fame
For you came to heal the broken
To redeem and make me whole
Bless the Lord, bless the Lord, oh my soul

Oh my soul
Bless the Lord
Bless the Lord---Lyrics submitted by Angel.
