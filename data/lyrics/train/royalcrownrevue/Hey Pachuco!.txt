Hey Pachuco!

Summer '43 the man's gunnin' for me
Blue and white mean war tonight
They say damn my pride and all
The other cats livin' down eastside
And there's no place to hide

Oooh Marie you better grab my jack
And zip gun for me
And I'll face no shame
'Cause tonight's the night I die for our name

Well I died to be swingin'
Babe we've been singin'
Just having a time
Free to do whatever
Now more than ever
I got to stick to that gang of mine!---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
