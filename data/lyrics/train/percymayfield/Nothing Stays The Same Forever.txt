Nothin' stays the same forever
No, nothin' livin'..ever stays the same
A little child turns into a big kid
And by and by...you'll see a change
(why), Big oak trees from little seed rows
And so does every...every thing in life
So in return...your fellow men, he (?)
Just be glad you have arrived
'Cause nothin'...stays the same forever
So, try to live...and watch the change
Best to be...among the livin'
Hmm, can't you feel...the joy it bring
(why) Babblin' brooks...and runnin' water
Hills and dells...and countryside
You defy...your saddest memory
and make tomorrow be worthwhile
'Cause nothin'...stays the same forever
Every night must turn to day (yes, and yesterday)
And if you are...a thinkin' person (he-he-he-he)
Take a little time to pray
(why) Father Time and Mother Nature
Married long before our time
Count your blessings...past and present
Uh, then only search for peace in mind
'Cause nothin'...stays the same forever
And I don't care how much you try (no)
Man was born..to witness wonder
And man was also born....to die
Man was born to die....born to die---Lyrics submitted by Phil Berkowitz.
