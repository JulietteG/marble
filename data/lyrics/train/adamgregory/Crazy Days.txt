Baby lets take a drive
Top down underneath the Carolina sky
We can watch the fireflies try to outshine the stars
I wanna lay a blanket down
Find a way back to where our love was found
Baby lets go right now

Chorus:
Back to our hearts beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies
First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on baby take my hand
Lets find a way back to our crazy days

Don't worry about what to wear
Those faded cut off jeans are my favorite pair
Don't go messin with your hair
Let it all blow around
Move over in the middle by me
Just like you did when your daddy couldn't see
Why his little girl loved a boy like me

Chorus:
Back to our hearts beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies
First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on baby take my hand
Lets find a way back to our crazy days

Bridge:
You remember cuttin' class
Heading to the creek
Doin 95 down a two lane streets
Staying up all night talkin about forever you and me
I can see that look in your eyes
And if I know you, they don't lie
They're telling me you're think about going back
About getting back

Chorus:
Back to our hearts beating wild
In the back of my beat up truck
Back to those butterflies
First time we felt in love
Back to your smiling eyes
Come on baby take my hand
Lets find a way back to our crazy days---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
