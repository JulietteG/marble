I used to be someone you knew
from the beginning he dreams of conquering
the obsession of his life had begun to outdo

anything anyone had ever done before

from a clear sky he stared
upon where he had started from
(all that's left to own is yourself)
all that's left to own is yourself
(all that's left to own is yourself)
I have a cold sidewalk to sleep on
and I brave city walls
that have eaten men alive

I am the hitchhiker
where will I be tomorrow?

please feel sorry so they won't have to
the first person that listened to me was you

where I'm from
where I'm going
is not important
you'll probably never see me again
all that's left to own is yourself

all that's left to own is yourself---Lyrics submitted by daniel.
