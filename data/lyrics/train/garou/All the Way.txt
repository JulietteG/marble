I wish I'd know you better 
Then it wouldn't be so hard 
Face to face we're heads up 
Our future's written in the cards 
I bet it's gonna cost 
For me to buy your trust 
I wanna go all the way 
But something tells me that won't happen 
You're starting to take this game too far 
I wanna go all the way 
But going there would leave me broken 
Heading up straight into contradiction 
I gotta stop gambling that sweet addiction 
I guess you got me blind 
When you led me by the hand 
There can't be 3 of this kind 
Only you and I can stand 
You called me 
If you raise me up I am all in 
I wanna go all the way 
But something tells me that won't happen 
You're starting to take this game too far 
I wanna go all the way 
But going there would leave me broken 
Heading up straight into contradiction 
I gotta stop gamble that sweet addiction 
There's just one too many consequences 
Down the river it can break 
If you just pretend and still believe it 
You will lie down with your faith 
If you really wanna play 
Together we can make it happen 
you shouldn't push this game too far 
I wanna go all the way 
But going there will leave me broken 
Heading up straight into contradiction 
I gotta stop gambling that sweet ...addiction---Lyrics submitted by *.
