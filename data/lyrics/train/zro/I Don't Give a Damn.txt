[Intro:]
I need Christ, that's the only thing I know*
I really can't breath right,
I'm strangled by animosity from by own people,
Lately it's hard to be nice,
My face is frowned up everywhere I go,
And I can't sleep nights
I'm in my ride tryin to find my foes (Why You Be Trippin Z-ro?)

[Verse 1:]
They say my music won't make it,
Cause I don't rap cars or dancing,
I rap pain, poverty and fraud romancing,
Who gon' represent for that brother on death row
And let him know whether he did it or not
God has his back from the get go,
A lil' mama that's hustlin' riskin' her freedom,
House full of kids and none of the baby daddies around
And she just tryn to feed em,
Even if she's layin on her back for bread,
Instead of talkin' about her show her to earn it without opening legs,
Why my people rather point fingers and turn up their noses,
Showin love then strikin' a match, ya ain't that so explosive,
And I'm guilty just like everobody else
Cause when I'm talkin to ya'll I'm talkin to self,
I know your tired of shown love and never gettin it showed back to ya
When all you need is a hug, people show they backs to ya,
Well hear me when I tell you everytime the world in a devil dig shift,
God s your homie, can't nobody in the world fuck with ya...

[Hook:]
If you feel like you wanna die
Sometimes you can release stress to this,
Just keep god first in your life,
Even when you feel like he ain't blessin it,
If you get mad like I get mad, then you be agged like everyday,
But all u gotta do is learn to let go and let god handle it,
Ain't nothin' you can say...
I don't give a damn, but all these fellas droppin' salt on your name,
I don't give a damn, but you can't pay your bills
Cause your short on your change,
I don't give a damn, man I just saw your woman huggin and kissin another man,
I don't give a damn, Cause God got me & if u don't know you better ask somebody...

[Verse 2:]
800 days minimum wage about to lose your house
If you don't get a raise just stay close to goin to work with the 12 gauge,
Ya you see a new millenium but feel like your in the stone age,
Stressin' every 7 minutes from livin' with aids,
Subtracting days from your life but because of the virus,
You dyin' from worry and thangs you can't change,
Be mad at Satan it's too many other name's to blame,
Only god can bring forth rain to smother pain flames,
And then the sun gon shine, no matter what the doctor tell you,
The lord decide when it's the end of your time,
Just look at magic, ya it was tragic,
But he's still at it, lookin, functionin, and feelin fantastic,
I know my people cry a river and it's alright to cry,
But don't commit suicide, you can't make it to heaven taking your own life,
So repeat after me, the devil ain't pimpin me,
Cause I can do all things through Jesus Christ who strengthens me...

[Repeat Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Look 'lil mama I can feel what your goin through,
Your another diamond dancin' at the player's club
Tryin' to pay your way through school,
And to the brother that's out jackin brothers who don better,
Homie you ain't gotta do it like that,
I know it's diffcult tryin' to make it if you ain't havin cheddar
But what you gon' do when brother's strike back,
And just because your white and I'm not,
Doesn't mean tryin' to plot on takin' your last dime
But I know just because I got a diamond grill in my mouth,
U thinkin I wanna steal dolla bills out your house,
Even though u think I'm an animal I don't give a damn,
A true hero under god is what I am...
