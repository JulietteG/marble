[Z-Ro]
No more pain I'm 'bout to open toughts on it
I ain't never had no good times I put my dawgs and my locs on it
Chain smoking cigarattes back to back
Unless I was pillow fighting with the kids I miss that
But it's a different day and time and I'm all alone, with nobody to call my own
Different area codes poppin up in my phone
Probably just another hoochy searching for some sex
It ain't got nothing to do with me it's all about my check
If it wasn't for the music you niggas would keep me down
Wouldn't give a fuck about how I'm doing it's all about a rap
Realizing I ain't nothing without paper and pen
So lord forbid I get in a wreck like the deal she was in
Let me make my mama proud if she can see me
Cause heaven ain't to far away from the ghetto but touchin' it ain't easy God
Give me the victory and bring me out the rain, give me something to smile about and

[Hook]
No more pain, somebody tell me what heaven this is 'cause I'm sick of living so low
In my life, to many problems bottled up inside I promise I can't take it no more
No more pain, if there's a brighter day let it come my way let me see the sunshine
In my life, 'cause i can't tell if I'm comin' or going i just wanna die sometimes

[Z-Ro]
First off i gotta say that I'm thankful for Trae
If I ain't never told you I love you I'm tellin' you today
Cause you made me keep my head on straight
When I was talking suicide you made me keep my info red on safe
Instead of me sleeping outside you would open your home
And tendin' your cousin even tho' you had problems of your own
I appreciate you my nigga it's deeper than rap
Somebody else would of wanted to see me fall off track
See i remember when i couldn't afford to get a wing dinner
Put my 2 dollar's with yours and we split a wing dinner
Doing bad even tho' we had a album selling
The distrabution company was stacking but they wasn't telling us
Steady robbing us blind, wasn't no money flowin'
Till' we got independent and we could see our money growing
So maybe now we can afford to give our people some change
Witnessing nothing but better days and

[Hook]
No more pain, somebody tell me what heavin this is 'cause I'm sick of living so low
In my life, to many problems bottled up inside I promise I can't take it no more
No more pain, if there's a brighter day let it come my way let me see the sunshine
In my life, 'cause i can't tell if I'm comin' or going i just wanna die sometimes

[Z-Ro]
Now when i say no more pain let me explain
Cause God bring certain events to happen that can't be changed
I used to cry when my friends died
But then i realize I'm the one who's still facing hard times
I recall fiending for my last breath, 'cause I was struggling
And still ain't got what I'm supposed to have yet
As far as these woman I've been through so many make-up's just to break up
I'd rather bee all alone when I wake up
No more pain, I'm not insane I'm just hurting
But i've been looking for feel good's, 27 years and still searchin'
If it ain't one thing it's anoter
I'm livin' on memories when I used to get along with my brothers
Since I never been to much of a man to cry, i shed tears like it's a 95
So to relieve pressure from my brain
I try not to give a damn about anything so i can feel

[Hook]
No more pain, somebody tell me what heaven this is 'cause I'm sick of living so low
In my life, to many problems bottled up inside I promise I can't take it no more
No more pain, if there's a brighter day let it come my way let me see the sunshine
In my life, 'cause I can't tell if I'm comin' or going i just wanna die sometimes---Lyrics submitted by Eduardo.
