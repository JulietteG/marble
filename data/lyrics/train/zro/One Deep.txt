[Intro: Z-Ro]
Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep.

[Z-Ro:]
Right now, For my next selection
All you bitch ass niggas & all you bitch ass bitches... this ones dedicated to you.
'Cause y'all muh'fuckers ain't shit. I promise y'all ain't shit.

Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep.
Y'all niggas don't have to...

[Verse 1:]
Come around my way 'cause I don't need another fair weather friend with a trick up his sleeve
Actin' like he really my partner but he after my cheese
I'm suffocated by the weak, please leave let me breathe.
Remember? Y'all Ain't want me to hit the weed
Now I'm rappin' you see me & tell me to hit the weed
Thinkin' you can get a VIP pass & get in free
But Joseph McVey is enough company for me
Wanna kick it with me 'cause I kick it with the high class
Y'all didn't wanna kick it when I was down on my ass
In my corduroy bitches y'all was in Louis Vaton
Laughin' & pointin' at a nigga tryin' to ruin my fun
For usin' the millennium or money by the ton
You niggas ain't help me get it, I did it with no one
Fuck showin' love back, I ain't showin' none.

Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep.
Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep.
Y'all niggas don't have to...

[Verse 2:]
Come to none of my shows or buy none of my tapes
'Cause with or without your support I'm a still be straight
The less niggas around me, the better I can concentrate
When I can't think straight, or open up my chest plate
It could be your death date, get beside yourself.
We ain't cool? I think you better rewind yourself
Before a cemetery, be where you can find yourself
So get your feet & let the door close behind yourself
I don't need no friend, I don't need no broad
Only thing I need is the help of the good Lord
Tryin' to kick it but muh'fuckers seem too hard
I'm a be keepin' it real, they gon' be keepin' it fraud
A hundred & 52% are real with me
Instead of runnin' with the game keep steel with me
I can do bad One Deep, so I chill with heat.

Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep.
Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep.
Y'all niggas don't have to...

[Breakdown:]
If you know a bitch ass nigga throw up your hands.
And if you know a bitch ass bitch throw up your hands.
If you know a bitch ass nigga throw up your hands.
And if you know a bitch ass bitch throw up your hands.
If you know a bitch ass nigga throw up your hands.
And if you know a bitch ass bitch throw up your hands.
If you know a bitch ass nigga throw up your hands.
And if you know a bitch ass bitch throw up your hands.

"Y'all niggas ain't gotta..." Fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep.
Y'all niggas don't have to fuck with me 'cause I can do bad just bein' One Deep.
Y'all niggas don't have to...

"I remember how you niggas decided to player hate.
I'd like to take this time out & give a special thanks to y'all.
Thanks to y'all.
I remember how you fellas decided to player hate.
I'd like to take this time out to give a special thanks to y'all.
Thanks to..." ---Lyrics submitted by kattie.
