Sittin' At A Bar lyrics

Bar tender I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time

When I got home it was 6 a.m.
The door was locked so I kicked it in
She was trippin' on the bills
I think she was high on some pills
She threw my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard
And in my drunkin' stooper
I did what I should of never done
Now I'm sittin' here talking to you
Drunk and on the run

I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
and Crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away



You know Mo I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers' till they get here

Yeah I know the sun is comin' up
And Yall are probably gettin' ready for closin' up
But I'm trying to drown my soul
I'm tired of this life on a dirt road
And everything that I love is gone
And I'm tired of hangin' on

She got me sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
and Crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away

          (Rap. vi: perform music with spoken rhythmic vocals: to speak in verse using rhythm and rhyme over music with a strong beat, usually hip hop) 

I guess it's meant to be
Romance is misery
So much for memories
And now I'm headed to the Penitentiary
See me on T.V.
The next cop series
I am a danger
I guess I should've done something about my anger
But I'll never learn
Real things I don't concern
I pour kerosene on everything I love and watch it burn
I know it's my fault
But I wasn't happy it was over
She through a fit so I crashed that piece a shit nova

            (Real Singing, Not Rap)
And now I'm goin' back again
Back to the Pen to see my friends
When we all pile out that County Van
They'll ask me where I've been

I've been at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
Eye Crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away.

La, La, La,  LaLa,

La, La, La,  LaLa,

La, La, La,  LaLa,
