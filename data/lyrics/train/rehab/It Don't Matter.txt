It don't matter


Sittin' in traffic another day of feeling nothing trying to find something I guess it's back to huffin' paint and model glue oh how i die when I look at 
you smilin' lovin' life and how all i know is blue
rainy days and cold stares
Broken love affairs Everything's beautiful as long as i aint there I guess i wasn't meant to crack a smile, Who cares I think i'll go to sleep for a while.


I'm barely livin' in my skin depression's my only friend and i dont know
where i am heading trying to forget where i've been, and i'm so sick of lying, god please show me that silver lining cuz i've heard tale and i'm not well my head's  full of hell and this world's a jail but....

{Chorus}
And it dont matter  i dont care I let my pain my pain into the air cuz  everything good's over there and everything here's hard to bare {x2}


And as the pain begins to displace  had it to ear level with this place you see it on my face a suspended grace gradually i erase and find comfort in the sickest womb I might be present but not in the room to whom it may consume  melting ensembls bleeding chellos running through bordellos drama like othello hidin' out from poncharello dead off in the median   fallin apart like usual handin' out flyers to my funeral! So they say life's a play and all the world's a stage, and for another part i pray the show ends the same way everyday and my heart carries the pain of a brain i cant explain, Am i insane? Am I insane?


{Repeat Chorus}

Everything good is gone {x6}

It doesn't really matter now does it?  {Repeat Chorus}---Lyrics submitted by jay.
