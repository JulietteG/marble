You know, they say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned 
So vengeful and mother earth has been done wrong
And I think she's sick
Yo, she's pukin up LAVA
Her nerves tremble along fault lines ready to drop an entire city of filth 
that's been forced upon her
We built these towers of Babel and feel remorse for nada
The momma divorce the father
The children are droppin bottles
The rich get richer, poverty's hot under the collar
Takin prayer outta schools and we're tryin to raise scholars
Creationism vs. the theory of evolution
Air, water, land, mind, body and soul pollution
Kids steppin on land mines from wars we're all losin
We're chasin false idols, erasing from our bibles the golden rule 
the youth are becoming more suicidal
Who teaches them, you and I do
No wonder they want to fight you
Raised by hypocrites, you feel lied to. 

Hook: 
Graffiti the land with skyscrapers
Graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
Graffiti the minds of children with your man-made laws
Graffiti the world, I saw the writing on the wall

We've got ABC, NBC, MTV, TNT, the BBC, DVD, VHS, DSL, A and E, XTC, mp3, FCC, THC, NRA, GOP??.. ADD
The fight for free speech, lack of responsibility
Thieves in positions of power
Internet pornography
Guns in the home for fear that the next knock at the door could be death
The terrorists are in the White House and oversees
Racists, separatists, vicious militias
The Buddhists, the Hindus, the Muslims, the Christians
Could it be our biggest barrier is language
Or is oil that important that one would inflict anguish
So cars can deplete the ozone on highways 
That stretch across the land where Indians once raised families
We're in denial, the world is afraid
And you say there's no more slaves

Hook: 
Graffiti the land with skyscrapers
Graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
Graffiti the minds of children with your man-made laws
Graffiti the world, I saw the writing on the wall

We're addicted to planes, trains and automobiles
We're addicted to addiction
We dig livin in fiction
For money, power, respect, the Army's got to go kill
They're under contract so let the blood spill
Sorta morbid ain't it this picture that I just painted
It's an epiphany I had 
I realized just how tainted our thinking really is
While in New York when I saw a teenager being arrested for taggin a fuckin wall. 

Hook: 
Graffiti the land with skyscrapers
Graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
Graffiti the minds of children with your man-made laws
Graffiti the world, I saw the writing on the wall---Lyrics submitted by lindsey.
