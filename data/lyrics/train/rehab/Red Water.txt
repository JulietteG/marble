When I was twelve, while checking the mail
I was admiring the car of the man next door
And thinking to myself, man, one of these days
I'm gonna have me a house like that with a big, red door
And his yard was mowed, and his grass was green
And the driveway was edged and all the shrubs were trimmed so perfectly
I had a crush on his wife and I played ball with his son
I pondered how much money he made, went inside and turned the TV on

[Hook:]
And he was laying in an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said, he had a smile on his face
His final offer, the steam on the mirror said
One more thing to say

I was watching TV, having one of mom's famous rice crispy treats
Watching Tom and Jerry, I heard a car horn beep
I ran to the window, his wife and son were home
With bags of stuff they had got at the mall
I went in my room and got my glove and ball
I leapt off the stairs, and asked his son could he play
And his son looked at his wife and his wife told his son I guess it'll be okay
And that beautiful woman, she walked in that beautiful house
When I realized I forgot my hat, I said I'll be back and turned around
And he was laying in an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said, he had a smile on his face
His final offer, the steam on the mirror said
One more thing to say
There was screaming and there was crying
There was sirens, I thought I was dreamin
And the sun was shining, it was a beautiful day
His wife was talking to an officer
Through the noise I heard her say

[Hook:]
And he was laying in an overflowing bathtub of red water
The first and the last time he ever relaxed
And they said, he had a smile on his face
His final offer, the steam on the mirror said
I got one more thing to say---Lyrics submitted by kellie.
