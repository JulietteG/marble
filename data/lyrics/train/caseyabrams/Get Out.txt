Girl you, hit me harder than a freight train
Right in the middle of my membrane
Driving backwards in the fast lane
Head lights off after midnight
Saw you shinning in the starlight
Girl you got me like a bug bite
And now youre under my skin

I know, you know, I dont know which way to go to loose you
To get away from you girl

Lately, Ive been going crazy
Cuz I want you baby
But you dont, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cuz Im breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I cant have you
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
Just get out, get out, get out

Play me, like boy you never gonna get me
Youre just lucky that you met me
Ill make sure you dont forget me again

I dont what I would do if I was without you
Even though I am, Im always thinking about
Spending all my waking time forgetting about you
But youre under my skin

I know, you know, I dont know which way to go to loose you
To get away from you girl

Lately, Ive been going crazy
Cuz I want you baby
But you dont, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cuz Im breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I cant have you
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
g-g-get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart

And Im lying alone in my bed
Wondering why love makes me feel like Im dead
Baby, you gave me a taste now Im wasted

Lately, Ive been going crazy
Cuz I want you baby
But you dont, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cuz Im breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I cant have you

Lately, Ive been going crazy
Cuz I want you baby
But you dont, so get out, get out, get out, get out
Cuz Im breaking
And my soul is shaking
Like my world is quaking
If I cant have you
Get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart
Just get out, get out, get out, get out of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart---
