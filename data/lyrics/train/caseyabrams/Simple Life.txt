Don't need no TV I don't need no phone
Don't need a speedy car to get me home
Don't need no nothing all i need is time - for the simple life
Go get your butt out off that lazy couch
Put down the laptop and get out of the house
Don't need no nothing all i need is time - for the simple life

I got a brand new scratch on my Cadillac
Try to call the body shop but my phone is dead
Tried to email my brother but the wifi's down
This stuff is haunting me all year round

I'm fixing one thing and another one's coming lose
It's making me think - how much it stinks
I keep on buying new things that i can't really use
If it just gets you annoyed - then what is the point

Don't need no TV I don't need no phone
Don't need a speedy car to get me home
Don't need no nothing all i need is time - for the simple life
Go get your butt out off that lazy couch
Put down the laptop and get out of the house
Don't need no nothing all i need is time - for the simple life

I'm taking one step forward and three steps back
Kick myself for letting go of the things i had
Guess you don't know what you got till that junk goes bad
Never should have dumped that hand me down i got from dad

I'm solve one problem and another one's popping up
Ain't it ironic how the problem get's chronic
Cause when you got it good - you just don't know when to stop
Don't worry bout the earning - if it stops you from living

Duhm duhm duhm's and Scooby-Doo's

Don't need no TV I don't need no phone
Don't need a speedy car to get me home
Don't need no nothing all i need is time - for the simple life
Don't need no TV I don't need no phone
Don't need a speedy car to get me home
Don't need no nothing all I need is time - for the simple life
Go get your butt out off that lazy couch
Put down the laptop and get out of the house
It doesn't hurt if you would try some times it's the simple life---Lyrics submitted by robert j chavez.
