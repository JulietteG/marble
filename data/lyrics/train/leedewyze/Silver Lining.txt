Remember when I met you on a park bench
And you smiled at me and said that we should be friends
Cause I was drowning bad up on the dry land
And then sat beside and put your hand in my hand
And then you picked me up and you put me in a straight line
You looked at me and said that it would be fine
We take our time to find the silver lining
We can make these crying waters into wine
Well be alright
Well be alright

Remember when you found me on the cold ground
You were looking up as the sky was looking down
And you said that you were jealous of the bright stars
I said darling, youll be brighter than they all are
So then I picked you up and I put you in a straight line
You looked at me and I said that it would be fine
Take our time to find the silver lining
We can make these crying waters into wine
Well be alright
Well be alright

Cause they, they dont know our heart
And they wont break us apart
And we, we dont have so much
But we, all we need is us

If we take our time to find the silver lining
We can make these crying waters into wine
Well be alright
Cause they, they dont know our hearts
And they wont break us apart
And we, we dont have so much
But we, all we need is us---
