You couldn't find your peace
Within the bitterness that burns
For the sleeping dogs that lie
Forever to return
Forever to return

Gone but not forgotten
You cut me down just to watch me bleed
Gone but not forgotten
I gave you the last word
And that's the last thing you'll take from me

This injustice that you hold
Belief in the story that you sell
For the sleeping dogs that lie
They're alive and well
Alive and well

Gone but not forgotten
You cut me down just to watch me bleed
Gone but not forgotten
I gave you the last word
And that's the last thing you'll take from me

Last thing you'll take from me
Last thing you'll take from me---
