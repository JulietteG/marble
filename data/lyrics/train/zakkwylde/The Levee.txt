There was a time when your waters had run still
I don't know where, but those waters have died
As you held hands with the hell beneath your feet
You turned your back and waved heaven goodbye

When the levee fell away
For you lost more than yourself that day
When the levee fell away
Forever is just a word you say

For all of the colors in your dreams have gone astray
Just like a blind man who's lost his way
As the clock ticks and the end is near
You left town, yet your troubles are all still there

When the levee fell away
For you lost more than yourself that day
When the levee fell away
Forever is just a word you say

This train has run out of track
As the engines fade
Far, far, far away, you fall
And that's where you'll stay

When the levee fell away
For you lost more than yourself that day
When the levee fell away
Forever is just a word you say---
