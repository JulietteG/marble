i've been around this world, yet i see no end,
all shall fade to black, again and again,
this storm that's broken me, my only friend, yeah!

in this river all shall fade to black,
in this river ain't no comin' back,
in this river all shall fade to black,
ain't no comin' back!

 withdraw a step away, just to find myself,
the door is closed again, and the only one left,
this storm that's broken me, my only friend, yeah!

in this river all shall fade to black,
in this river ain't no comin' back,
in this river all shall fade to black,

in this river all shall fade to black,
in this river ain't no comin' back,
in this river all shall fade to black,
ain't no comin back!

(solo)

in this river all shall fade to black,
in this river ain't no comin' back,
in this river all shall fade to black,

in this river all shall fade to black,
in this river ain't no comin' back,
in this river all shall fade to black,
ain't no comin' back!---Lyrics submitted by Tucker.
