As you sink to the bottom of the silence you embrace
The lonesome worry and all it's replaced
Lost within your darkness is where you wish to be
The truth stands before you and yet you choose not to see

The light that burned
Has all but gone away
As you drown within your harbors of pity
And their lifeless waves

As you drift far far away
Broken dams of resentment
With nothing to say
Your ship of joy has long disappeared
Ceaseless descent upon the weight of one's tears

The light that burned
Has all but gone away
As you drown in your harbors of pity
And their lifeless waves---
