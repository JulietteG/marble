She thinks she needs to buy more jewelry
She thinks she needs a guy with strings
She thinks she needs all new friends
She thinks she needs to be a perfect teen
She needs to get straight
She needs to stop shakin
She needs to stop makin everybody rich, everybody rich

I think I need to enlist in the navy
I think I need a dominatrix
I think I need to live in the desert
I think I need to take a little trip
I need to stop sleepin
I need to stop dreamin
I need to stop makin everybody guess, everybody guess

Heres that perfect photograph
Of dogs and cats and how they act
So quit with the guilt trip it just aint done
Ive tried safe sex but its no fun

Now, everybodys fine.  Everybodys fine.
Everybody were all fine.

Weve got to stop breakin down
Weve got to stop wakin up
Weve got to stop makin everybody mad, everybody mad

He thinks he needs a higher office
He thinks he needs a bigger muzzle
An he thinks he needs a younger woman
Well, maybe he just needs another station
He needs to shut up
He needs to listen
He needs to stop makin everybody tired, everybody tired
The roots in the cellar are on the make
The birds in the trees, yeah, theyre all fake
You cant find what you cant hide
Dont look for me, I aint outside

Now, everybodys fine.  Everybodys fine.
Everybody were all fine.

Everybody were all fine.---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
