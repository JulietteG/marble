Save the plastic bag, but let the lettuce rot
Instead of sayin what we are, we renew what we are not
Forget to buy the vodka, but remember the vermouth
Let you go for a lie, kill you for the truth

Last nights judgment day is this mornings cartoon
I just wanna see some light
Sun king of light is there to remember

Remember (Remember) Remember (Remember)

Sail through the red, stop for anything pink
Talkin black and white, get up what you think
Make love for a second, hide for a week
Keep the perfect secret, talk in your sleep

Last nights judgment day is this mornings cartoon
I just wanna see some light
Sun king of light is there to remember

Remember (Remember) Remember (Remember)

Forget to buy the vodka, but remember the vermouth
Let you go for a lie, kill you for the truth---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
