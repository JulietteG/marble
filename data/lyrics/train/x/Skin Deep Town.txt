They want each other
The bigger the better
Not enough brains to go around.
But theres plenty of bodies
 In this skin deep town skin deep town skin deep town.
Well their nerves are all burnt up
from laying in the sun.
They care more about their carburetors than their livers.
Convertibles overflow with idiots having fun,
Yelling Its always summer on the beach.
Cause they want each other
The bigger the better
Not enough brains to go around.
But theres plenty of bodies,
In this skin deep town skin deep town skin deep town.
Well, the sun came up
Out of the Atlantic,
And them and teenagers and skin traders 
They took it away in their car.
Yknow they wear wet T-shirts to bed,
and Live behind bars,
And ladies can always drink free.
Cause they want each other
The bigger the better
Not enough brains to go around.
But theres plenty of bodies,
In this skin deep town skin deep town skin deep town.
Them 40-year olds were there too.
They were still after that adolescent season,
You know Winter is what they fear most (thats what theyre gonna get).
When they see me dressed in black,
They nudge each other and laugh,
And I wish that it would snow in Fort Lauderdale,
or at least
Rain and hail rain and hail rain and hail
In Fort Lauderdale.
