Theres a little girl dancing out on the street
You cant tell if shes hungry
Young man offers her a cigarette
All his clothes are soakin wet
Papers blow by just like her luck
He looks so good when he dresses up

You want a new life, better than this one
It aint so fair, just want it different
You want a new life, better than this one
It aint so fair, you just want it different

Theres a turquoise house out in the suburbs
Clothes hangin on the line
One just like it burned down last week
Right next to mine

You want a new life, better than this one
It aint so fair, just want it different
You want a new life, better than this one
It aint so fair, you just want it different

New life                     New life
New life                     New life

That same little girls dancing in her living room
Ship came in not a minute too soon
An old man thinks of her at Union and Main
Handin out smokes in the pourin rain

You want a new life, better than this one
It aint so fair, just want it different
You want a new life, better than this one
It aint so fair, you just want it different

New life                     New life
New life                     New life---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
