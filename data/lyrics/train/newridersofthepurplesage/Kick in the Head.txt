Do you think we can work it on out?
Change the whole proposition about?
Im in no position for an act of sedition
But i really love to scream and shout

Half a loaf is better than a kick in the knee
Is there gonna be some tea
Or just more sympathy?
I really got a pumper on the line this time
Its mine, mine, mine

I ran to the king of creation
I told him: save a bit for me
The way things look i could have written the book
You know i can hardly read

Sally does your dog bite? No, no, no
Keep him on a choke chain, reel him out slow
Got a little place, call it my own
It never really was a home

Went to the college of evil,
The smoke nearly drove me away
Id go crazy if i wasnt so lazy,
What more can i say?

The white-face lydian judge
Wont you give a little one-two-three
Him down on the corner
Singing "little jack horner"
But you gotta let the gravy be

A whole loaf is better than a kick in the head
If you tell me what you mean
Ill tell you what i said
I sent you for jelly, you come back with jam
Who exactly do you think i am?---Lyrics submitted by addie corn.
