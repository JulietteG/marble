Called me screamin'
Tellin' me your leaving
You can't take it no more
But that's so crazy
Cause it's me
Whose fed up
You been messin' up
I been sittin'
And waitin'
But now I'm goin' on
You pushed me over
And over again
Don't know how to
Talk to me
Don't know how to
Treat me
But your twisted
In your head
Somehow you reversed it

I make you
I make you
Mad
Is what you say
I make you baby
You ain't seen
Mad
Baby until you seen
What you created in me

Many years gone by
My life gone
With them
Thinkin' you change
But I don't know why
Givin' everything
Gettin' nothin'
But your promise
Bogus
Total disregard
For me and my feelings
Don't have to
Deal with this
Lookin' at you
Makes me sick
Ooh oh ooh
You treat me so nasty
The thought of you
Touchin' me
Makes me wanna vomit baby
But somehow you reversed it on me

I make you
I make you
Mad
Is what you say
I make you baby
You ain't seen
Mad
Baby until you seen
What you created in me

I make you
I make you
Mad
Is what you say
I make you baby
You ain't seen
Mad
Baby until you seen
What you created in me

Done nothin' but
Takin' advantage of me
Mistaken my niceness
For someone weak
Now you gon' tell me
That you gon' leave
Well after all you
Done to me
That would be
The nicest thing

Called me screamin'
Tellin' me your leaving
You can't take it no more
But that's so crazy
Cause it's me whose takin
All I can take
I have crossed over
From love to hate

I make you
I make you
Mad
Is what you say
I make you baby
You ain't seen
Mad
Baby until you seen
What you created in me

I make you
I make you
Mad
Is what you say
I make you baby
You ain't seen
Mad
Baby until you seen
What you created in me ---Lyrics submitted by Marie Williams.
