What you did to me this morning
Had me late for work I'm stressing
Missed my meeting all I'm thinking bout is you, you, you, you
And now I'm looking at the clock
Counting the hours 'til I'm back in your arms
Wish I never had to let you go

Time can't move fast enough
Until I, get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to, ooh

Stuck in transit off daydreaming
I miss you, there's so many reasons
Most of all I really wanna lay with you, and just feel your touch, babe
And now I'm looking at the clock
Counting the hours 'til I'm back in your arms
Wish I never had to let you go

Time can't move fast enough
Until I, get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to, oh

Time can't move fast enough
Until I, get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to, ooh

Baby I'm addicted to every single part of you
But I swear this addiction is healthy
Serve me up another dose
Be ready babe I gotta go
Ooh, ooh, I
Wish I never had to let you go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh I

Time can't move fast enough
Until I, get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to, ooh

Time can't move fast enough
Until I, get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to my baby
Get right back to, ooh---
