I feel alone and Ill pray for this,
but I never want to be so clear.
I hold my head and Ill beg for this,
but I never want to be so clear.

I came back for you,
even if you wont too.
Know I came back for you,
even if you wont too.

Two years have gone, I cannot wait for this,
but Ive never seen so much fear.
Computers on, I cant be late for this,
because theres nothing that will keep you here.

I came back for you,
even if you wont too.
Know I came back for you,
even if you wont too.

You see what I see.
Nothing left to talk about.
Nothing left to comeback.
Nothing left to honor yourself.

Your love in my head.
Nothing left to talk about.
Nothing left to comeback.
Nothing left to honor yourself.

Youre made to see
what has been wronged.
Im out at sea
your Sirens song
is supposed to be
what keeps me going.
If they should meet,
the cast is gone.

You see what I see.
Nothing left to talk about.
Nothing left to comeback.
Nothing left to honor yourself.

Your love in my head.
Nothing left to talk about.
Nothing left to comeback.
Nothing left to honor yourself.---Lyrics submitted by Eros.
