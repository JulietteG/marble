Where we come from
We keep to ourselves
Always dot our I's
And then get battered around
Because it always was
And it always is
Shattering cold ground
And without a sound
You cannot acknowledge
All the things you've done in college
You know we've already been charged with it
You can't go on kicking yourself
He tell you you're no son
And you could never be one
Through the darkest turns
Of the MRI's
That eats away
As if the sun burst from the sky
You cannot acknowledge
All the things you've done in college
You know we've already been charged with it
Oh, can't get myself down
Oh, can't find my way
What I can't face ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
