You're a big girl now
And responsible
For all the things you've got
And all the things you know
(Ooooohh)
And for everything you don't
Well you'll find out eventually
(Eventually)
Hey!
You think you know it all
When you really don't
Just live the dream
Your dream 
But somehow you won't
And you're trying just too hard
You gotta find it naturally
(Naturally)
What's meant to be is meant to be
(Meant to be)

Baby if you're down on your luck, 
Then you build it up

So if you're down on your luck
Then you build it up
There's only one thing to do 
When there's not enough
Don't turn around now
Give yourself another second last chance
Second last chance

And when you're down on your luck 
Then you build it up
There's only one thing to do 
When there's not enough
Don't turn around now
Give yourself another chance

You're not on your own
I'm always by your side
Just keep pushing on 
And keep your head held high
Don't you throw it all away
Relax and count from one to ten
(One to ten)
Patch it up and try again

Baby if you're down on your luck
Then you build it up

So if you're down on your luck
Then you build it up
There's only one thing to do 
When there's not enough
Don't turn around now
Give yourself another second last chance
Second last chance

And when you're down on your luck 
Then you build it up
There's only one thing to do 
When there's not enough
Don't turn around now
Give yourself another chance

Whoooo
Yeah, yeah
Baby, yeah

Just give yourself another 
Second last chance 
(Now baby come on)

You owe yourself another 
Second last chance
(You, you, you, you gotta gotta give yourself)

So if you're down on your luck
Then you build it up
There's only one thing to do 
When there's not enough
Don't turn around now
Give yourself another second last chance
Second last chance

And when you're down on your luck 
Then you build it up
There's only one thing to do 
When there's not enough
Don't turn around now
Give yourself another chance

(You got to give yourself)
Ooo-ay
Ooo-o
(Another last chance)
Ooo-ay
Ooo-o
(You owe it to ya. you owe it to ya. you owe it to yourself)
Ooo-ay
