It's a big world to walk through honey
And if you got love, you don't need money
You're gonna get caught in the toughest times
You hold each other and you hold a life
You kiss on the mornings when the sun won't shine
And that don't cost a dime

It's a big world to walk through honey
And if you got love, you don't need money
You can't get lost in the dollar signs
You take each night one day at a time
You live on water until it turns into wine
And that don't cost a dime

I'm out of bed and step outside
Look up ahead its all blue sky
You already have what really matters most in this life

It's a big world to walk through honey
And if you got love, you don't need money
You're gonna get caught in the toughest times
You hold each other and you hold a life
For what it's worth there's my advice
And that don't cost a dime

Don't cost a dime
And that don't cost a dime
Don't cost a dime
Yeah, love don't cost a dime---Lyrics submitted by Mandi.
