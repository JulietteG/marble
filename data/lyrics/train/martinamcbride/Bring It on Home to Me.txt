If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Oh oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself
Oh-oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

I'll give you jewellery and money, too
That ain't all, that ain't all I'll do for you
Oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

You know I'll always be your slave
Til I'm buried, buried in my grave
Oh honey, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

I tried to treat you right
But you stayed out, stayed out every night
Oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
