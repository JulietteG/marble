If you don't know me by now
You will never, never never know me

All the things that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now boy I know the difference, between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to upset our happy home
Don't get so excited if I come home a little late at night
And we only act like children when we argue, fuss, and fight

If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me

We've all got our own funny moods, I've got mine
And boy, you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do
Please get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye
Cause what good is a love affair when you can't see eye to eye

If you don't know me by now
You will never, never never know me
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never never know me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
