There used to be a graying time all alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remains, a drug gets me high, that's how I feel.
Did you know, that when i snows
my eyes become enlarged
and the light that you shine can be seen

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
The more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the grey

There is so much a man can teel you
so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a grown addiction that i can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy babe
but did you know that when it snows, my eyes become enlarged
and the light that you shine can be seen

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
The more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom on the grey

I've been kissed by a rose on the grey, 
I've been kissed by a rose
I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
I've been kissed by a rose on the grey

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me your like a grown addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy babe
But did you know, that when it snows, my eyes become enlarged
and the light that you shine can be seen

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
The more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the bloom on the grey

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
The more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the bloom on the grey

Now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the grey---Lyrics submitted by Daniela.
