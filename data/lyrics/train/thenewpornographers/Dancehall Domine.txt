They love you with the lights on, repeating, reciting
Whenever you feel gentle, whenever you'll be nice
Yet someone will have to break the lines
But then that turn you right
They love you with the lights on, turn them on but don't bother
Never been so loved but you're handling it well, lover
Just like every idea, want to be like no other

When we go to dancehall domine
And let it.. don't let it, never let it be said
We go to dancehall domine
You're covered in... don't let it, never let it be said
I've got, got to go
Now I've got, got to go
In the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart

They love you with the lights on, defeated, delighted
You'll never say the right thing, so keep it exciting
You don't have to break the lines, no they're letting you right in

When we go to dancehall domine
And let it.. don't let it, never let it be said
We go to dancehall domine
You're covered in... don't let it, never let it be said
I've got, got to go
Now I've got, got to go
In the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart---
