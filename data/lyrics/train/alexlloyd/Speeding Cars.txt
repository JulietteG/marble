Here's the day you hoped would never come
Don't feed me violence, just run with me
Through rows of speeding cars
The paper cuts, the cheating lovers
The coffee's never strong enough
I know you think it's more than just bad luck

There, there, baby
It's just text book stuff
It's in the ABC of growing up
Now, now, darlin'
Oh don't lose your head
'Cause none of us were angels
And you know I love you, yeah

Sleeping pills, no sleeping dogs lie never
Far enough away
Glistening in the cold sweat of guilt
I've watched you slowly winding down for years
You can't keep on like this
Now is as bad of time as any

There, there, baby
It's just text book stuff
It's in the ABC of growing up
Now, now, darlin'
Oh don't kill yourself
'Cause none of us were angels
And you know I love you, yeah

It's okay by me
It's okay by me
It's okay by me
It was a long time ago

It's okay by me
It's okay by me
It's okay by me
It was a long time ago

There, there, baby
It's just text book stuff
It's in the ABC of growing up
Now, now, darlin'
Oh don't lose your head
'Cause none of us were angels
And you know I love you, yeah

There, there, baby
It's just text book stuff
It's in the ABC of growing up
Now, now, darlin'
Oh, don't kill yourself
'Cause none of us were angels
And you know I love you, yeah---Lyrics submitted by allison.
