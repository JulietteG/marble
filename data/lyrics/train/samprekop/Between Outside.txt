Still on my
Two long days
If you don't know me this morning
I'm allowed to get along
By myself
Ignore other ones
By myself

I don't suppose I
I coulda started sooner
Rewriting the letter, the last one
We get along both sides now

Two long days
Feels like weeks
Keeping up since I just started
Spell it out, but who's to blame?
All my friends used to say I knew you

I don't suppose I
I coulda started sooner...---Lyrics submitted by Kevin Irlen.
