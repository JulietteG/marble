Who I was before is meaningless
Yeah, I killed him good, there's nothing left

I'm nothing without you
I'm tired of living a lie
Pretending that I deserve your call
Sometimes I'm truly surprised
You've kept me alive this long

I will be your love
Holding you close to my heart and forever
I will endeavor to show

That I will be your love
And I won't let go
Now that I know you well
I've tried to make it alone
But I can't atone for this spell

I will be your love
Holding you close to my heart and forever
I will endeavor to show

I'm nothing without you

I will be your love
Holding you close to my heart and forever
I will endeavor to show

I'm nothing without you---Lyrics submitted by maria.
