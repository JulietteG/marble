I don't wana have to learn the hard way
I don't wanna fall along the side
While I keep on running out this good race
I will testify

I just wanna listen to your heartbeat
Tell your people Lord, you're still alive
And there ain't nothing sweeter than your mercy 
I will testify
That it's all for you

I don't wanna keep on living my way
I don't wanna keep believing lies
I don't wanna wait until it's too late
I will testify

I just wanna listen to your heartbeat
Tell your people Lord, you're still alive
And there ain't nothing sweeter than your mercy
I will testify
That it's all for you

That it's all for you
I'm gonna do it all for you

I don't wanna have to learn the hard way
I don't wanna fall along the side
While I keep on running out this good race
I will testify

I just wanna listen to your heartbeat
Tell your people Lord, you're still alive
And there ain't nothing sweeter than your mercy 
I will testify

It's all for you
I'm gonna do it all for you
Oh I'm gonna give it all for you
I'm gonna do it all for you---Lyrics submitted by maria.
