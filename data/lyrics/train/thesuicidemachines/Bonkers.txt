I don't have a lot to say because i lose my mind each day
 So lock me in a padded room, straight up, straight out
 Straight jacket doom
 Goin' nuts, insane you see this padded room so leave me be
 This padded room here all the time. cause you see
 I lost my mind

I bust a nut an lost a bolt, now you know my lifes on hold
 Cause all these doctors think im crazy, but all thi shit it doesn't please me
 Oh yeah , imgonna lose it now, can't stop me no way , no how
 There's a word, i hink its zonkers, all these people think im bonkers

Society is smothering me, this place is where people fuck quietly
 And they have bland orgasms, suburbia is so beautiful
 Expansive green lawns for expensive white people
 And that mailman he smiles and says hello
 (i just wanna roll his ass)
 You wanna know why?
 Cause now are the days you've got to be crazed
 You've gotta live your life your own way

I'd really like to run away, go out and have some fun and play
 But i'm still locked in this padded room
 With this world's fucked up, shitty gloom
 Competition sucks, you see this padded room is killing me
 This padded room, i'm here to die. just tripped out
 No reason why
 I pound a spike and lose a screw
 My brains scrambled
 Nothing you can do
 Be great to play while someone pays me, not called bonkers its called lazy
 I'll stand up and take a bow what do you think of me now?
 There's a word i think its zonkers,
 All these clones they say i'm
 Bonkers!---Lyrics submitted by Sergio.
