(Verse 1)
Don't tell me what to do, what to wear, what to say.
Don't wanna follow rules, gonna do it my way.
I've got a brain, I can think for myself.
I don't wanna be like everybody else.

(Chorus)
Na nana na nana na nana na.

Don't wanna be like everybody else.

Na nana na nana na nana na.

Don't wanna be like everybody else.

(Verse 2)
Don't tell me to be quiet, to be a good girl.
Wanna see more of this wild wild world.
Don't learn anything sitting at home.
I wanna be free, I want to roam.

(Chorus)
Na nana na nana na nana na.

Don't wanna be like everybody else.

Na nana na nana na nana na.

Don't wanna be like everybody else.

(Guitar solo)

(Verse 3)
Wanna pick up the guitar and start to play.
Bash my drums all night and day.
I wanna play it loud this ain't no toy.
I wanna be wild, wanna make some noise.

(Chorus)
Na nana na nana na nana na.
Don't wanna be like everybody else.
Na nana na nana na nana na.
Don't wanna be like everybody else.
Na nana na nana na nana na.
Don't wanna be like everybody else.
Na nana na nana na nana na.
Don't wanna be like everybody else.---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
