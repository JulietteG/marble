Tells everyone what she said
Gossip makes her feel less dead
She laughs so hard so she don't cry
So you can't see her life's a lie
Telling lies about her friends
In all those messages that she sends
Meeting people left and right
They won't stay without a fight

She's the pleaser whose never pleased
Always trying to get what she needs
She'll say anything to agree

She's the pleaser
She's the pleaser
Pleased to meet her
She's the pleaser
Pleased to meet her
She's the pleaser

Tells you want you want to hear
Looks over your shoulder, whispers in your ear
Can't find a reason to talk to you
Makes up stories that just ain't true

She's the pleaser whose never pleased
Always trying to get what she needs
She'll say anything to agree

She's the pleaser
She's the pleaser
Pleased to meet her
She's the pleaser
Pleased to meet her
She's the pleaser

She follows people like she follows trends
Whatever it takes for a few fake friends
She can't please herself at the end of the day
Where will she go when they all go away?

She's the pleaser whose never pleased
Always trying to get what she needs
She'll say anything to agree
She's the pleaser

She's the pleaser whose never pleased
Always trying to get what she needs
She'll say anything to agree

She's the pleaser
She's the pleaser
Pleased to meet her
She's the pleaser
Pleased to meet her
She's the pleaser
She's the pleaser
Pleased to meet her
She's the pleaser
Pleased to meet her
She's the pleaser---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
