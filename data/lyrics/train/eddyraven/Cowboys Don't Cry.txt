Shoulda seen it coming
Shoulda know you werent that kind of girl
Ya didnt like the life style
Ya didnt understand the cowboys world
Lookin back I wonder
When it was I finally realised mmmmmm
No matter how you hurt me
Cowboys dont cry

Cowboys dont cry they move on
One more rodeo and a few more broken bones
Nothins better than one good eight second ride
You play you win you lose you try
Cowboys dont cry

For me it was a passion
For you it was a fashion show each day
I was boots and saddles
You were double D and santa fe
But you never said forever
So I guess you never did tell me a lie mmmmm
Honey that still hurts me
Cowboys dont cry---Lyrics submitted by Nelly.
