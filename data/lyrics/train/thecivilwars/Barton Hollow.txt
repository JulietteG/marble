I'm a dead man walking here
That's the least of all my fears

Ooooooooooooh underneath the water

It's not Alabama clay
that gives my trembling hands away

Ooooooooooooh please forgive me father

Ain't going back to Barton Hollow
Devil gonna follow me e'er I go
Won't do me no good washing in the river
Can't no preacher man save my soul

Did that full moon force my hand 
or that unmarked hundred grand

Ooooooooooooh underneath the water

Ooooooooooooh please forgive me father

Miles and miles in my bare feet
still can't lay me down to sleep
If I die before I wake
I know the lord my soul won't take
oooooooooooooh

I'm a dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking

Keep walking and running
 running for miles

Keep walking and running
running for miles

Oooooooooooooh

Ain't going back to Barton Hollow
Devil gonna follow me e'er I go

Won't do me no good washing in the river
can't no preacher man save my soul---Lyrics submitted by aubree.
