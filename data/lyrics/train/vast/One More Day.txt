Have you heard
Have you tried to understand
It's all right
It gets easier with time

How are you
Are you ever coming back
I have changed
And i've realized i was wrong

I was wrong
Now i'll never see your face anymore
Oh my love
I'd give anything for one more day with you

I'm getting through
I wish you felt the way i do
I have changed
And i've realized i was wrong

I was wrong
Now i'll never see your face anymore
Oh my love
I'd give anything for one more day with you

I was wrong
I was wrong
Now i'll never see your face anymore
Oh my love
I'd do anything for one more day with you

I'd do anything for one more day with you
I'd give anything for one more day with you---Lyrics submitted by Holly.
