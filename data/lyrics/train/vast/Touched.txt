touched, you say that i am too
so much, of what you say is true
i'll never find some quite like you again
i'll never find some quite like you, like you
the razors and the dying roses
plead i don't leave you alone
the demi-gods and hungry ghosts
oh god, god knows i'm not at home
i'll never find someone quite like you again
i'll never find someone quite like you again
i, i looked into your eyes and saw
a world that does not exist
i looked into your eyes and saw
a world i wish i was in
i'll never find some quite as touched as you
i'll never love some quite the way
that I loved you---Lyrics submitted by Dariusz.
