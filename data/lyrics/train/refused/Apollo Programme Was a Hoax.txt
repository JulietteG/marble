Petrol bombs and barricades
Anything to have our say
Consequence of no choice at all
Empires rise and empires fall

Now it's time to flip some coins
And it's time to turn some tables

Suck on my words for a while, choke on the truth of a million dead
There is no prestige in your title, we are after your head
The destruction of everything is the beginning of something new
Your new world is on fire and soon you'll be (too)

Sabotage will set us free
Throw a rock in the machine
Sabotage will set us free
Throw a rock in the machine
Throw a rock in the machine
Throw a rock in the machine---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
