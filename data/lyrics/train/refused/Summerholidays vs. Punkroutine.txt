I'm tired of losing myself in some 
Stupid childhood dream of what I could've been. 
Money proves the point, and I'm stuck between 
Summer holidays and punk routine. 

I shoot off a 100 things to remain 
more sorry than safe you see, 
I only get this chance once, 
and I just can't let it be. 

And I'm still certian that what motivates me 
Is more important than any piece of paper could be. 
Well adjusted and corrupt, 
All those icons that stole our teenage lust. 

A scenario of simplicity, A scenario of you and me(2x). 

(Chorus) 
Rather be forgotten, than remembered for giving in 
Rather be forgotten, than remembered... 
(..than remembered...) 
..for giving in!! 
Rather be forgotten, than remembered for giving in 
Rather be forgotten, than remembered... 
(..than remembered...) 
..for giving in!! 

(Short Instrumental Break) 

(Bridge) 
We're all tired of dying. 
So sick of not trying 
Scared that we might fail 
We'll acomplish nothing. 

We're all tired of dying. 
So sick of not trying 
Scared that we might fail 
We'll acomplish nothing!! 

Not even failure(4x). 

(Chorus) 

..Giving in!!(4x)---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
