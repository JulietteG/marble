Getting healthy is just time and money
Running free is just fools gold
Keeping busy that's just kind of funny.
Playing dead that just gets so cold
Living lazy can be forgiven
Living wild is a game for the young
Living quiet that is the road to heaven
Living dirty that's just to much fun

Once in a while

Making a money is an empty promise
Staying strong as a stone in the sea
Seeing to much, that just keeps you honest
Laying low that's the place to be

Once in a while

Weep like rain falling down
Keep that good luck around
Weep like rain falling down
Keep that good luck around

Loving crazy is a kind of sickness
Loving free is the burning of leaves
Loving lonely that just leads to sadness
Loving you friend that's to love all three

Once in a while

Weep like rain falling down
Keep that good luck around
Weep like rain falling down
Keep that good luck around

That's it for me
That's it for you
That's the color of the truth

That's it for me
That's it for you
That's the color of the truth

Weep like rain falling down
Keep that good luck around
Weep like rain falling down
Keep that good luck around---Lyrics submitted by Steve Drake.
