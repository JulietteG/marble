Now that it's over
You really must agree
That you and me
Were aiming for different things

Junking into sober
Our long bender over
You and me we missed it by degrees

Fractured wind
Fade my functioning
It's a new world [order] mama
Ain't nothin' what it's been

Backing out on different nights
Waking up in different ways
You and me I'd say we had our days

You got to skinny
I guess I got to old
You and me was hot for it when cold

Fractured wind
Fade my functioning
It's a new world [order] mama 
Ain't nothin' what it's been

The hat that I'm wearing
Don't fit my head
The color is to bright
The straw is splintering in

I used to just shop man
Dapper in trend
Now you should see
These shoes that I'm in

x2
Fractured wind
Fade my functioning
It's a new world [order] mama
Ain't nothin what it's been

It's a new world [order] mama
Well let it all begin.---Lyrics submitted by Steve Drake.
