On my wedding day
Gonna run to the mountains
Drink a bottle of whiskey
And go to sleep in a cave

Im sure he was very nice
I just couldnt be bothered
With forever and ever
You know it sounds so insane 

You were looking so good in your Dockers and jeans
Drinking scotch on the rocks 
Makes me wanna believe you
Come on next to me
I just wanna be on your side

Its astronomical
Ive got stars in my eyes for you 
My eyes for you
An illusion of light 
Ive got stars in my eyes for you
My eyes for you, oh
Promise you do too

On our wedding day
You wont care about flowers
Well get busy for hours
And have sangria for lunch

In the light of this bar you look exactly like James Dean
Maybe Ive had a drink or three
Maybe Ive had too much

One more sip and then I might sing Dock of the Bay 
Or something by the Police
If they let me on stage
Anything to impress you
I just wanna be on your mind

Its astronomical
Ive got stars in my eyes for you 
My eyes for you
An illusion of light 
Ive got stars in my eyes for you
My eyes for you
I dont wanna be wrong
Ive got stars in my eyes for you
My eyes for you
Promise you do too
But its never a real thing
It was only a good thing
Yeah it seemed like a good idea
Time is meant to be wasted
When youre young and its 3 a.m 
And youre happy again
Think Im happy again

You were looking so good in your Converse and jeans
Drinking rye on the rocks 
Makes me wanna believe you
Come on next to me
I just wanna be on your side

Its astronomical
Ive got stars in my eyes for you 
My eyes for you
An illusion of light 
Ive got stars in my eyes for you
My eyes for you
I dont wanna be wrong
Ive got stars in my eyes for you
My eyes for you
Promise you do too
Promise you do too---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
