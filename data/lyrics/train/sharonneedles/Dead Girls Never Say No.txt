Verse 1:
I'm six feet underground now
And I'm six feet tall
Extend your shovel down now
Down to my acrylic claws

Pre-Chorus:
Dig me up and dig me out
Come down on in and take me out

Chorus:
With the scent of a girl who has been embalmed
It was me and the maggots till you came along
When you're already dead love can never die
I'll be your Rosemary's Baby tonight
Dead girls, dead girls
Dead girls, dead girls never say no
Dead girls, dead girls
Dead girls, dead girls never say no

Verse 2:
Dress me up from head to toe tag
Your taboo fantasy
Treat me good before I go bad
We're making hearse-tery

Pre-Chorus:
Dig me up and dig me out
Come down on in and take me out

Chorus:
With the scent of a girl who has been embalmed
It was me and the maggots till you came along
When you're already dead love can never die
I'll be your Rosemary's Baby tonight
Dead girls, dead girls
Dead girls, dead girls never say no
Dead girls, dead girls
Dead girls, dead girls never say no

Bridge:
I'll fall for you I'll fall apart
I could be your Tanzler bride
I'll fall for you I'll fall apart
And you could be my Vincent Price

Chorus:
With the scent of a girl who has been embalmed
It was me and the maggots till you came along
When you're already dead love can never die
I'll be your Rosemary's Baby tonight
Dead girls, dead girls
Dead girls, dead girls never say no
Dead girls, dead girls
Dead girls, dead girls never say no---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Levy.
