please sing to me,I can see you open up to breathe because fast words make it easier on me
If the points to never disappoint you, somebodys got to tell me what to do
I just wish you, could have seen me when it used to come so easy
I'd like to say that its easy to stay but it's not for me, because I'm barely here at all

[pre-chorus]
slow down now the secrets out, and I swear now, everything is perfect...

[chorus]
What you want, what you need has been killing me
trying to be everything that you want me to be
I'll say yes, I'll undress,I've done more for less
I will change everything till its perfect again

coming down, coming around giving a frown to the sound when I hit ground
I hate the way that I should stay when I know I dont give a fuck about it anyway
I shake hands and shoot smiles all around as I sell my body by the pound
sign my name on the dotted line, that would be fate do not resuscitate

[pre-chorus]
slow down now the secrets out, and I swear now, I'll still make this perfect...

[Chorus]
What you want, what you need has been killing me
trying to be everything that you want me to be
I'll say yes, I'll undress,Ive done more for less
I will change everything till its perfect again

I think it's better this way
This is good in a bad way
it's better this way
I'll make this perfect again

I'll make this perfect again!

[chorus x2]
What you want, what you need has been killing me
I will change everything, you want me to be
I'll say yes, I'll undress,I've done more for less
I will change everything...
What you want, what you need has been killing me
trying to be everything that you want me to be(I'll make this perfect again..)
I'll say yes, I'll undress,I've done more for less
I will change everything(everything..)

I'll make this perfect again...---Lyrics submitted by Teresa.
