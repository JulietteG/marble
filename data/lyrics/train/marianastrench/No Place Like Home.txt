There's no... yellow
bricks to follow back, and run from that disaster.
Familiar sins, come crashing in.
And sever forever and after.
My old friend, it's time I leave you here
For whats for all in frozen alabaster.
Believe me.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

A shallow grave, where I can keep it safe
for hide away for just in case I need it.
my old friend, it's time to say goodbye again.
no need to tell me where you've been, I feel it.
Shallow graves for shallow hearts.
For pick-me-ups and fall aparts.
For promises that never started right.

Carolina, Carolina, tell me how I'm gonna get down from here?
You only ever just disappear, but I can't let you go.
Carolina, Carolina, tell you how am I getting the ending right.
I know I started it wrong but I...
I think that it's as easy as 1,2,3
Do you see what I do?
Truth or dare, yes I double dare you.
You, you mean now I think you got it right.

(There's no place like home... there's no place like home)
(There's no place like home... there's no place like home)
(There's no place like home)

Oh, another day on the assembly line.
Everybody better march in time.
'Cause the fact that we don't care why.
you been saying could've, should've, would've.

Oh, another day on the assembly line.
Everybody better march in time.
'Cause the fact that we don't care why.
you been saying could've, should've, would've.

Oh, another day on the assembly line.
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
Everybody better march in time.
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
'Cause the factory don't care why.
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
you been saying could've, should've, would've.
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)

Oh, another day on the assembly line.
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
Everybody better march in time.
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
'Cause the factory don't care why.
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)
you been saying could've, should've, would've.
(Toy soldiers will you follow?)

I face the music when it's di-ei-ire!

This is true love, ever after.
This is true love, ever after.

True love! ever after!
This is true love! ever after!
This is true love, ever after.

Once upon a time
This place was beautiful and mine
But now it's just a bottom line
(There's no)
Yellow bricks and happily. ever after we lived.
The End. ---Lyrics submitted by Atourina Slewa.
