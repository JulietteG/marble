When your tears are spent on your last pretense 
and your tired eyes refuse to close and sleep in you defence.
when it's in your spine like you've walked for miles 
and the only thing you want it just to be still for a while.

(oh eh, oh eh, oh ewwwww)

if your heart wears thin i will hold you up 
and i will hide you when it gets too much.
i'll be right beside you.
i'll be right beside you.

when you're overwhelmed and you've lost your breath when the space between the things you know is blurry nonetheless.
when you try to speak but you make no sound 
and the words you want are out of reach 
but they've never been so loud.

if your heart wears thin i will hold you up 
and i will hide you when it gets too much.
i'll be right beside you.
i'll be right beside you.

i will stay, nobody will break you.

trust in me, trust me, don't pull away, just trust in me, trust me, 
i'm just trying to keep this together, because i could do worse and you could do better

When your tears are spent on your last pretense 
and your tired eyes refuse to close and sleep in you defence.

if your heart wears thin i will hold you up 
and i will hide you when it gets too much.
i'll be right beside you.
nobody will break you.

if your heart wears thin i will hold you up 
and i will hide you when it gets too much.
i'll be right beside you.
nobody will break you.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
