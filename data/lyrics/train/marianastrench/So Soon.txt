You say sometimes it's like I hardly know you, 
And maybe, there's some things I never showed you,
Sometimes you're certain, 
But you just can't get it working at all.

You say to yourself somebody better,
Will understand you more than I ever,
I'll shake his hand and smile,
And say I understand
Well I do.

That don't mean I don't think about you.

[Chorus]
I know we,
Said it just as well that I won't keep,
Keep you for myself but, 
I don't wanna see you happier with somebody else,
Oh,
Why can't you just be lonely,
La-lonely, la lonely,
Why can't you just be lonely
La-lonely, la-loney,
Why can't you just be lonely
La-lonely, la-lonely
I know you need someone to,
this just feels so soon.

I know some things should just stay broken, 
I'm well aware this should remain unspoken,
But I've been workin' on the things that I was learning all wrong

Oh,
I know sometimes I only twist you,
And maybe,
I'm too proud to say I missed you,
But what is here and now,
I tell you that I'm all figured out,
Or maybe I just like how that sounds.

[Chorus]
I know we,
Said it just as well that I won't keep,
Keep you for myself but, 
I don't wanna see you happier with somebody else,
Oh,
Can't you just be lonely,
La-lonely, la lonely?
Why can't you just be lonely
La-lonely, la-loney?
Why can't you just be lonely
La-lonely, la-lonely?
I know you need someone to,
This just feels so

And I know it seems beneath me,
But sometimes it's not so easy,
To wish you well and let you go.

And I said it's just as well,
That I just can't keep you for myself
I don't wanna see you happier with somebody else

Lo-lo-lonely, la-lonely, la-lonely
Why can't you just be lonely,
La-lonely, la lonely,
Why can't you just be lonely
La-lonely, la-
This just feels so, this just feel so,
Feels so soon
Why can't you be,
Why can't you be,
This just feels so,
This just feels soo...

This just feels soon.---Lyrics submitted by Jake Donahue.
