This might sting a bit
You got here just in time to see everything fall apart
I'm not upset at all
But it's sad to see that everybody knows
That I've been down in here before and maybe I could want it more
I know I never tried to stop I never try

(Chorus)
Shut your mouth and hey
So what's one more excuse, guess
I just like the abuse
Dizzied up in my never try vertigo
They're calling out for blood, guess it's just understood
Said we'd always try, as long as
I just don't do

Disappointed
And no one thought that this would be me and my everything
Is this pound of flesh enough
And I'll cut away until you say enough
I've been down in here before and maybe I could hit some more
I know I never tried to stop I never try

(Chorus)
Shut your mouth and hey
So what's one more excuse, guess
I just like the abuse
Dizzied up in my never try vertigo
They're calling out for blood, guess it's just understood
Said we'd always try, as long as
I just don't do

Heartbeat, heartbeat

(Chorus)
Hey
So what's one more excuse, guess
I just like the abuse
Dizzied up in my never try vertigo
They're calling out for blood, guess it's just understood
Said we'd always try, as long as
So what's a little vertigo? (Tell me what you wanna know)
So what's a little vertigo? (Tell me what you wanna know)
So what's a little vertigo? (Tell me what you wanna know)
So what's a little vertigo? (Tell me what you wanna know)
So what's a little vertigo? (Tell me what you wanna know)---Lyrics submitted by jawzyln.
