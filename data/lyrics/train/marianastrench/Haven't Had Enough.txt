Testing, testing
I'm just suggesting
You and I, might not be the best thing
Exit, exit
Somehow I guessed it right
Right

But I still
Want ya, want ya
Don't mean to taunt ya
If you leave now, ill come back and haunt ya

You'll remember,
Return to center now, now

Well I just wish we could go back,
One more time, and begin it!
Back before, I lost myself somewhere
Somewhere in it.

We've been stuck now, so long
We just got the start wrong
One more last try,
Imma get the ending right
You can stop this
And I must insist, 
that you haven't had enough,
you haven't had enough

Stuck now so long,
We just got the start wrong
No more last place
You better get your story straight
You can stop this
And I must insist that you haven't had enough
You haven't had enough

I still need ya, need ya
Don't mean to tease ya
If you want me, ill come back and meet ya
Whisper, whisper
You must admit you want it
You, you want it


Well I just wish we could go back,
One more time, and begin it!
Back before, I lost myself somewhere
Somewhere in it.

We've been stuck now, so long
We just got the start wrong
One more last try,
Imma get the ending right
You can stop this
And I must insist, 
that you haven't had enough,
you haven't had enough

Stuck now so long,
We just  got the start wrong
No more last place
You better get your story straight
You can stop this
And I must insist that you haven't had enough
You haven't had enough

Don't you need it!
Don't you want this at all
(Testing, testing I'm just suggesting)
Don't you need it! 
Don't you want this at all!
*Josh's awesome scream*

Stuck now so long
We just  got the start wrong
One more last try
Imma get the ending - YOU
You haven't had, you haven't had enough!
Not the best!
Don't you need it
Don't you want this at all!

Testing, testing
I'm just suggesting
You and I might just be the best thing.---Lyrics submitted by Keyasia Hollis.
