He made you feel plain
When he forgot your name
Well let me tell you something,
I have felt the same.
I know you're in pain
But there'll be another Boy along the way and
God he made you beautiful and
There's nothing about you that's plain.

[CHORUS]
You are jewel you're a treasure
You are one of a kind
And you shine just as bright
As the stars in the sky
You're a rare kind of wonder
Created just right
So keep your head up no matter the pain
There's nothing about you that's plain

You tell me you're not the type
The kind of girl that they like
And your a little insecure about
How you look in their eyes.
Well fashion will change,
Trends come and go everyday,
But God only made one of you and
There's nothing about you that's plain

[CHORUS]
You are a jewel you're a treasure
You are one of a kind and
You shine just a bright as
The stars in the sky.
You're a rare kind of wonder created just right
So keep your head up no matter the pain
There's nothing about you that's plain.

See your mind, it is precious
Though your heart may be restless
And your eyes they will see
All that you're meant to be
'Cause your spirit is strong
And your soul carries on
You'll keep your head up no matter the pain
There's nothing about you that's plain

You know I've had my days,
When I feel out of place....yea
I look at who I am,
Cover what I can ,
I wish it all would change. But...
Take the makeup away
You see the same girl still remains..
She may not feel that beautiful
But there's nothing about her that's plain.

[CHORUS]
You are jewel you're a treasure
You are one of a kind
And you shine just as bright
As the stars in the sky
You're a rare kind of wonder
Created just right so keep
Your head up no matter the pain
There's nothing about you that's plain

You may have felt plain,
But...God, He knows your name
Let me tell you something, yeah...
There's nothing about you that's plain---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
