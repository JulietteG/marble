here i am alone with You
quietly i talk to You
You said the truth would me free
so here i am, surrendering

i know, i can let Your promise be my hope and
i know, until You take me home

*chorus
i'm safe, (i'm safe) safe cause You love me
safe, (i'm safe) safe all because Your name
has power to calm the ocean
when everything changes, i'm safe
i'm safe

my heart is overflowing, with peace beyond all knowing
this love is deep, it shelters me
and i'm safe within Your reach.

i know, i can let Your promise be my hope and
i know, until You take me home

*chorus

*bridge
though the odds are stacked against me, though i'm running out of time
my heart is breaking, but i know that You are mine
so i let You see into me, as You hold me in Your hand
my heart is on my sleeve, i'm safe because You understand
You understand 
You understand

*chorus

i'm safe (5x)---Lyrics submitted by Meghan.
