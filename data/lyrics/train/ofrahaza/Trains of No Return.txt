YEH, YEH, we need the rain,
YEH, YEH, to wash the trains,
Endless nights,
Tortured days,
Trains of no return.

LO'EL ANI AKRO ANENI
AVKA BACHOL LAILO ANENI
TEN TAL UMOTOR ANENI
HO, ANENI

Don't let them grow again,
Oh, no, not again!
Don't let them roll again,
The trains of no return!

YEH, YEH, we need the rain,
YEH, YEH, to wash the trains,
Endless nights,
Tortured days,
Trains of no return.

LO'EL ANI AKRO ANENI, ANENI, ANENI
SHAM ZA'AKU KOLOT ANENU
BA'ARU OROT ANENU
HU LO YESHAKER

KOL HA'OR, KOL HACHOSHE
SHE YOFER MIKOL RA'U EICH
DIN HA'ELOHIM MOLECH
HEM GAM ME VAKSHIM

YEH, YEH, we need the rain,
YEH, YEH, to wash the trains,
Endless nights,
Tortured days,
Trains of no return.

Don't let them grow again,
Oh, no, not again!
Don't let them roll again,
The trains of no return!
Don't let them grow again,
Oh, no, not again!
Don't let them roll again,
The trains of no return!
YEH, YEH, we need the rain...---Lyrics submitted by Emma.
