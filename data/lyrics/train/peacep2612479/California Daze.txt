Here's one for the diamonds in the dark (California daze)
And all the people in the park (never feels the same)
Especially for the amblers in the gloom (it's the darkest gloom)
And all the feathers feeling blue

(CHORUS)
She tastes like sunlight
And she's always gonna be there in the back of your mind
There's no time to rewind
Were you born to live or born to die ?
Forget or forgive, there's a place you can live

Go and watch the pretty girls in town (California daze)
When you're feeling kind of down (never feels the same)
Lean into a California daze (it's the darkest gloom)
It's always been the fastest way

(Repeat CHORUS)

(Repeat CHORUS)

Forget or forgive, there's a place you can live---Lyrics submitted by Sophie Ash.
