Close your eyes and don't let the hearty boys 
Such a waste, cut your silky nose 
Ooh-ooh, I don't wanna see you 
Ooh-ooh, I don't wanna see you 

(Chorus) 
You could be my ice age sugar 
You lay me down, you make me shiver 
Blow me like a floating feather 
A movie doll, movie doll, movie doll forever 

It's no surprise, she's in spiky jagged clothes 
She's such a wraith, a lady of the sword 
Ooh-ooh, I don't wanna see you 
Ooh-ooh, I don't wanna see you 

Ooh-ooh, I don't wanna see you 
I don't wanna need you 

(Chorus) 
You could be my ice age sugar 
You lay me down, you make me shiver 
Blow me like a floating feather 
A movie doll, movie doll, movie doll 

You could be my ice age sugar 
You lay me down, you make me shiver 
Blow me like a floating feather 
A movie doll, movie doll, movie doll forever---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
