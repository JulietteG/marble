There... 
There must be an easier way to release these feelings 
So, so far from home
In need of your voice to hold my head together 
So, so far from home 
In need of your voice to lift my lonely state of mind 

You... 
You can't but wait for me to return, for me to show you how I felt 
These months have blurred and they just fly by
I need to feel you right by my side

So, so far home 
In need of voice to hold my head together
So, so far from home 
In need of voice to lift my lonely state of mind

Oh there must be an easier way
Oh there must be an easier way
Oh there must be an easier way to release these feelings

As the sea breeze hits my lungs it takes me back to where I belong
To where I belong 
As the sea breeze hits my lungs it takes my back to where I belong
To where I belong
As the sea breeze hits my lungs it takes me back to where I belong 
To where I belong---Lyrics submitted by Stacey Whelan.
