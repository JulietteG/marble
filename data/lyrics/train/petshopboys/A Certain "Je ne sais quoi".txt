Un, deux, trois, quatre...

I feel like sending you a love letter
Lets face it, nobody does it better
You're a promising prospect 
from what I've seen
If you wanna take me out on a detour
I'm not feeling too demure
I like the cut of your jib
If you know what I mean

There's something about that look in your eyes
There's something about the way that you smile
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi

In Berlin you're dancing to techno
before you catch the first flight to Moscow 
You know your way around an espace d'affaires
On the coast you're such a creation
and though New York's just an obligation
I've every confidence you'll amuse yourself there

There's something about that look in your eyes
There's something about the way that you smile
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi
There's something about the way that you think
There's something about the wine that you drink
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi

It's all perception
How people see you
And when they see you
they want to be you

Un, deux, trois, quatre

In Tehran they've known you for years
in spite of clerical fears
they think you understand their point of view
In the old days it would have been Rome
but now Beijing's a second home
It started in the eighties, just Bertolucci and you

There's something about that look in your eyes
There's something about the way that you smile
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi
There's something about the words you employ
There's something about the clothes you enjoy
You've really got a certain je ne sais quoi

When people see you
they want to be you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
