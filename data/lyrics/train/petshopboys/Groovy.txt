Will someone please say the unsayable?
Will someone please tell me I'm wrong?
I live every day like a sad beast of prey
For I have to appear to be strong
And that's wrong
I'm too weak to be strong

Today I met with the generals
And the head of my secret police
Discussing conspiracies and prison facilities
For opponents I can never release
And there'll be no peace
Until they're released

Of course I'm in league with the army
It's not like I've got any choice
They officially adore me and my father before me
But gunpoint has a firm voice

The joke is I'm not even a demagogue
Have you heard me giving a speech?
My facts are invented
I sound quite demented
So deluded it beggars belief
It would be such a relief not to give another speech

Can someone please say the impossible?
Crowds should be out on the street
I've lost any will to threaten or kill
I'll be easy for you to defeat
And any resistance I meet
I'll beat a retreat

I'd rather that you didn't shoot me
But I'd quite understand if you did
Watch out for the army
The generals will go barmy
At the thought of a takeover bid

Oh please will somebody put me
Out of my misery?
This sad old dictator must sooner or later
Flee so that you can be free

If you get rid of me
We can all be free---
