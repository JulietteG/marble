WE ARE SELDOM FULLY CONTENTED
WE MAY HAVE THIS CROSS TO BEAR
WHERE ELATION MEETS DISASTER
YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND US THERE

YES OUR WISDOM HOLDS THE SECRET
AND OUR FOOLISHNESS THE KEY
WE ARE ARCHITECTS OF INNOCENCE
DELINQUENTS OF PRESTIGE

DONT HOLD US DOWN
DONT CRAMP OUR STYLE

THIS IS LOVERS DAY

THIS IS LOVERS DAY

WE BUILT BOATS AND PLANES TO GET HERE
LINED THEM UP ALONG THE SHORE
TO CROSS THIS SEA OF EMPTINESS
THAT WILL BRING US TO YOUR DOOR

WHILE UPSTAIRS IN THE PENTHOUSE
TIGERS CLAW THE VELVET SUITE
WITNESS INTELLECT AND PLAYFULNESS
NOW THEY'RE FILED AND OBSOLETE

DONT HOLD US DOWN
DONT CRAMP OUR STYLE

THIS IS LOVERS DAY

THIS IS LOVERS DAY

THIS IS LOVERS DAY

THIS IS LOVERS DAY

THIS IS LOVERS DAY

DONT HOLD US DOWN---Lyrics submitted by KIRK.
