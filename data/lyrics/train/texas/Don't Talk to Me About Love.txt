They exchanged a look
An hour later her voice shook
When her whispering died, she cried
Never wants to recover, she cried

Don't talk to me about love
(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)
Don't talk to me about love
(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)

Since that gaze
Roaring by went her days
When her whispering died, she cried
Never wants to recover, she cried

Don't talk to me about love
(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)
Don't talk to me about love
(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)
Don't talk to me about love
(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)

(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)
Don't talk, don't talk to me
(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)

Don't talk to me about love
(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)
Don't talk to me about love
(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)

It couldn't be that good, although they said it would
Just couldn't be that good

Don't talk to me about love
(Yesterdays shatter, tomorrows don't matter)

Be that good
It couldn't be that good, although they said it would
Just couldn't be that good

Be be be that good
Be be be that good
Be be be that good---
