1 - I am in the wilderness
You are in the music 
In the man's car next to me
Somewhere in my sadness
I know I won't fall apart completely

2 - When I need to be rescued
And I need a place to swim
I have a rock to cling to in the storm
When no one can hear me calling
I have you I can sing to

3 - And in all this
And in all my life

4 - You are the lovers rock
The rock that I cling to
You're the one
The one I swim to in a storm
Like a lovers rock

Repeat 1
Repeat 3
Repeat 4
Repeat 4

When I need to be rescued you're there
When I need a place to swim to in a storm
I sing to you
And all my life
And in all my life

Repeat 4 ---Lyrics submitted by Cera.
