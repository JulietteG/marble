I was the one
I who could
Pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet
And I gave you my love
You are the one that got me started
You could have let me
Love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did you make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time
You'll always know the reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go
You lay me down and left me for the lions
A long, long time ago
You left me there dying
But you'll never let me go
You'll always know the reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go
You'll always know the reason why
The song you heard
Will stay on your mind
It ain't gonna let you go, no
'cos you were the moon
And I the endless sky
You'll always know the reason why
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go
Ain't gonna let you go
You had the keys to the car
You had every star
Every one of them twinkling
Baby what were you twinkling
Baby what were you thinking
We had the moon and the sky above
And I gave you my love---Lyrics submitted by TupacLove.
