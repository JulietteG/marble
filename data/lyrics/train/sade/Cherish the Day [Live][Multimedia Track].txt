You're ruling the way that I move 
And I breathe your air 
You only can rescue me 
This is my prayer 
If you were mine 
If you were mine 
I wouldn't want to go to heaven 

I cherish the day 
I won't go astray 
I won't be afraid 
You won't catch me running 
You're ruling the way that I move 
You take my air 

You show me how deep love can be 

You're ruling the way that I move 
And I breathe your air 
You only can rescue me 
This is my prayer 

I cherish the day 
I won't go astray 
I won't be afraid 
You won't catch me running 
I cherish the day 
I won't go astray 
I won't be afraid 
Won't run away 

You show me how deep love can be 
You show me how deep love can be 
This is my prayer 

I cherish the day 
I won't go astray 
I won't be afraid 
Won't run away 
Won't shy 

I cherish the day 
I won't go astray 

I cherish the day 
I cherish the day 
I cherish the day 
I cherish the day 
I cherish the day---
