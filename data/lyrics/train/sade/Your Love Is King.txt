Your love is king 
Crown you with my heart 
Your love is king 
Never need to part 
Your kisses ring 
Round and round and round my head 
Touching the very part of me 
It's making my soul sing 
Tearing the very heart of me 
I'm crying out for more 
Your love is king 
Crown you with my heart 
Your love is king 
You're the ruler of my heart 
Your kisses ring 
Round and round and round my head 
Touching the very part of me 
It's making my soul sing 
I'm crying out for more 
Your love is king 

I'm coming on 
I'm coming 
You're making me dance 
Inside 

Your love is king 
Crown you with my heart 
Your love is king 
Never need to part 
Your kisses ring 
Round and round and round my head 
Touching the very part of me 
It's making my soul sing 
Tearing the very heart of me 
I'm crying out for more 

Touching the very part of me 
It's making my soul sing 
I'm crying out for more 
Your love is king

Blind faith 
This is no 
Sad or sorry dream 
This is no 
Blind faith
