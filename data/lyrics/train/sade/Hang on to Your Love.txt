In heaven's name why are you walking away 
Hang on to your love 
In heaven's name why do you play these games 
Hang on to your love 
Take time if you're down on luck 
It's so easy to walk out on love 
Take your time if the going gets tough 
It's so precious 

So if you want it to get stronger 
You'd better not let go 
You gotta hold on longer 
If you want your love to grow 

Gotta stick together 
Hand in glove 
Hold tight, don't fight 
Hang on to your love 

In heaven's name why are you walking away 
Hang on to your love 
In heaven's name why do you play these games 
Hang on to your love 

Be brave when the journey is rough 
It's not easy when you're in love 
Don't be ashamed when the going gets tough 
It's not easy don't give up 

If you want it to get stronger 
You'd better not let go 
You gotta hold on longer 
If you want your love to grow 

Gotta stick together 
Hand in glove 
Hold tight, don't fight 
Hang on to your love
