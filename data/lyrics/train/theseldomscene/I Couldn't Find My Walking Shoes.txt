I fell asleep in my chair
Our Beds cold without you there 
and I dreamed you woke me with your tender kiss
but it's coffee alone because you never come home
how can I go on like this

Now it's my shattered pride and a pain deep inside 
and I know just what a smart girl would do 
so I found my old suitcase put on my goodbye face 
but I couldh't find my walking shoes

CHORUS
I couldn't find my walking shoes
but I found my heart aching and breaking in two
I found the door but I couldn't walk through
because I couldn't fine my walking shoes

BREAK

Now he'll find his way in with his ring on his hand
and some old alibi that's he's already used
oh it's over I know but I still can't go
because I couldn't find my walking shoes


CHORUS
I couldn't find my walking shoes
but I found my heart aching and breaking in two
I found the door but I couldn't walk through
because I couldn't fine my walking shoes---Lyrics submitted by Dee MacWilliams.
