I've been loving you
Without you even knowing
I'll never forget those days

Three days in a row
You were mine alone
And I haven't seen you since that day
I'm sorry, baby

Baby boy, when I saw you the first time
I knew right away that you and I
Were connected in a way

I believed that there was way something more
That I could ever express in my own words
I just knew at the time

I belonged to you but it all felt so wrong
To do the things that my heart gave in
Baby, I'm telling you

I've been loving you
Without you even knowing
I'll never forget those days

Three days in a row
You were mine alone
And I haven't seen you since that day
I'm sorry, babe

With loads on our minds, a few goodbyes
We could never have given it a real try
But you were in my head always

And at this point of my life I just know
That if you let me back in
I won't let go of you and me spending our lives

I just know it's a matter of time
Before it all falls back into place
Baby, believe me

I've been loving you
Without you even knowing
I'll never forget those days

Three days in a row
You were mine alone
And I haven't seen you since that day

I walk the line and for you I will shine
Just be prepared for a hell of a ride
Don't ever doubt 'bout the way I feel
For heaven sake, boy, I'm begging you

I've been loving you
Without you even knowing
I'll never forget those days

Three days in a row
You were mine alone
And I haven't seen you since that day---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
