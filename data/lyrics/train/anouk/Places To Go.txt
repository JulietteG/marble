This aint my home anymore
My beating heart and restless mind, in one
My eyes have closed on my way back home,
To a place that no one knows
I travel light, no more starless nights
Makes me shine from head to toe

Ive got places to go in this life
Ive got places to go anytime

Whats yours aint mine anymore
But somehow the roads are travelled
It feels like home right now
My eyes have closed on my way back home,
To a place that no one knows
I travel light, no more starless nights
Makes me shine from head to toe

Ive got places to go in this life
Ive got places to go anytime
Ive got places to go in this life
Ive got places to go anytime

Aint my home, anymore

Ive got places to go in this life
Ive got places to go anytime
Ive got places to go in this life
Ive got places to go anytime

Ive got places to go in this life
This aint my home anymore---
