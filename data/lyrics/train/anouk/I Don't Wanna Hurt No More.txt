We're breaking things we can't repair
None of us will take the blame
No nothing can be done this time
All the memories that we've made
I threw them all away
There's no need to talk it over
Don't let me get you down
Let's just move on 
I'm setting you free

[chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more
No I don't wanna make you go
Through one more rainy day
No I don't wanna hurt no more
Strange enough I always knew
I'm taking off today
Don't wanna hurt no more

The darkness you left in my soul
Do we know how much we've lost
Will the moon be shining as bright as before
And as I'm singing this song
The tears well up my eyes I will always wonder
Why I will never have the life I wanted
Now I'm letting go

[Chorus]

So why wait 'till morning comes
You've made it clear that it has been
Only pain lovin' me
Things that we won't do for love
I am setting you free

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Taja.
