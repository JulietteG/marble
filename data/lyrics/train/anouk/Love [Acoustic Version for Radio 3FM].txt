It's funny how I blind myself
So I don't have to see
You're taking me down
And bringing me to my knees
Letting me know I'm alone

I'm not afraid to die no more
The house above yeah
Oh heaven won't you pick me up now

Love
All I needed was love
Someone give me some lovin'
I guess it's only meant for some of us
Oh oh yeah oh yeah yeah

Life has made me lose my mind
I'm not doin' allright these days
Lying naked on my kitchenfloor
So cold....well I,
I thougt I had a lion's heart
I guess I was wrong
I feel so damn lonely
Yeah yeah

Love
All I needed was some lovin'
Could someone give me some sweet lovin'
'Cause this is more than I can bare

My nights are getting darker as time goes by
How I tried to keep these walls from falling down
One way or another
They shut me down 
They shut me down

Love 
All I needed was some love lord
Could someone give me some sweet love
Some sweet love yeah
I guess it's only meant for some of us
Oh oh yeah oh oh yeah yeah love
Give me love though
Give me love lord
Love love love love love love love
Why why won't you give me some sweet loving
Oh baby oh maybe all right all right yeah

Love
I guess it's only meant for some
Oh yeah yeah yeah
I guess it's only meant for some of us---Lyrics submitted by greet.
