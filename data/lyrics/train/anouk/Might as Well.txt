I might as well be cheating on you  	I do
I might as well be cheating on you

I also knew that you would be
Cheating on me finally
I never knew it be this soon
I didnt see it coming
Yesterday you let me down 
The only friend I thought I found

Sleepless nights hunted you
Maybe who was kissing you

If this would have happened to me ten years ago
Id make sure that youd be lying six feet underground
Little girls we grow up knowing love will find a way
So now we have an understanding and I can see who I may
I might as well be cheating on you  
I might as well do all the things you do
I might as well have a little fun
Baby you inspire its the way to carry on

Heavy steel is all you see that is what is left of me
No remorse no dignity can we get any higher
To every other happy fool his loyalty will come for you 
Lights go out on your own so much for pretending

Now if this would have happened to me ten years ago
Id make sure that youd be lying six feet underground
But little girls we grow up knowing love will find a way
So now we have an understanding thats just rock and roll 
I might as well be cheating on you  
I might as well do all the things you do
I might as well have a little fun
Baby you inspire its the way to carry on Yeah Yeah

Have you ever been in love before it doesnt matter
Cause nothing ever seems to be the way it should be 
Tell me why dont you love me like the way you used to do
It might be worth while to take a step back and ask your self how
This is gonna last when its all al lie
Here me out everybody ditch your spouse for someone else

I might as well be cheating on you  
I might as well do all the things you do
I might as well have a little fun
Baby you inspire its the way we carry on Yeah Yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah


I might as well be cheating on you  	I do
I might as well be cheating on you    I do
I might as well be cheating on you    I do
I might as well be cheating on you    I do---Lyrics submitted by larissa.
