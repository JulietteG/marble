Another year
Has come and gone again
Look around
And think where have you been

Trace the lines
On your face tonight
And dont forget
That this will pass in time

Its cold out this morning
You should be getting into bed
Cant believe its that time
Of year again

Curled up tight
A darker shade of white
Thinking back
Could be here for a while

Its cold this morning
And its getting hard to pretend
Cant believe its that time
Of year again

Can you believe the life you led
Did you achieve the goals you set
Did you lose your mind
Now and then

Is there a reason you wont mend
Is it a season that wont end
Cant believe its that time
Of year again

Another year
Has come and gone again
Look around
And wonder what happened

Its cold out this morning
You should be getting into bed
Cant believe its that time
Of year again

Youre fresh out of warnings
Maybe its time you called a friend
Forget that its that time
Of year again

Forget that its that time
Of year again---Lyrics submitted by Ianna.
