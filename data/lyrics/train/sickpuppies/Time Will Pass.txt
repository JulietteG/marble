Your closed off from all the light,
You haven't got the will to fight,
You'll drown yourself in your sorrow,
And push yourself until you get sick,
When everything is all around,
You wont bother to make a sound,
Your too impatient to sit and wait,

(chorus)
So listen to the knocking on the door,
It sounds so big its hard to ignore,
Just listen to your friends as they try,
Your watching the days go by,
Time will pass and you will corrode,
You will not know which is the road,
Or journey your supposed to take,
The journey your supposed to take,
I just hope you don't leave it too late,

So heaven help me for what i am about to say,
Heaven help me i seem to have lost my way,
My way,

(chorus)
So listen to the knocking on the door,
It sounds so big its hard to ignore,
Just listen to your friends as they try,
Your watching the days go by,
Time will pass and you will corrode,
You will not know which is the road,
Or journey your supposed to take,
The journey your supposed to take,
Yeah,

So listen in time as it passes you by,
Inseparably till the end of time,
Watching your days go by,
Watching your days go by,

Watching your days go by,

Time will pass and you will corrode,
You will not know which is the road,
Or journey your supposed to take,
The journey your supposed to take,
Yeah,

Time will pass and you will corrode,
You will not know which is the road,
The road.---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
