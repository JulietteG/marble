I'm feeling so afraid
Cause everything that I do lately,
Makes you angry.
I've never been so ashamed
It really felt like you and me were
Getting better

I hope that you still want me
I hope it's not too late.

(chorus)
Don't walk away
And leave without a reason
When there's too much to say,
That hasn't been said.
I know I was wrong
And i'm sorry for making the same mistake.
Don't walk away


Can you really throw away
All the time that we've recovered
One another
And i know i make it hard
but how long should i pay for being unappealing

i know you wanna want me 
i see it in your eyes

(chorus)

Wish I could take it back
But you know that I can't
(know i can't)
I hope on day you understand
No, this can't be the end. 
This is the end.

I know I make it hard

(chorus)

Don't walk away
[repeat x4]

It felt like you and me were getting better.---Lyrics submitted by chelsea.
