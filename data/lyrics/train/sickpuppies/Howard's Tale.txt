Age 5, just a little boy shy
Is he ready for the big surprise?
He'll be playin' lego in a dream
When the shadows come to life.

Age 9, and he should've been fine
With the secret he's sure to keep
Two times, had to tell a little lie
For the sake of him and me.

Now it's, over.
I need, closure.

~Chorus:
Hey, look what you did to me!
When you were takin' me home,
Gettin' me stoned,
Leave me alone!
I've waited
For mom to comfort me
But when I opened my mouth,

"Don't say nothin', shh."

Age 12, and it isn't going well
Now it's 3 years to the day,
Confused, but unlike you
This feeling won't go away.

16, and the woman down the street, 
Has invited him to come inside. 
The first time, it didn't feel right 
It'll be the last time he tries

~Chorus

"Don't say, nothin's wrong."
I won't say, nothing's wrong.

I won't say(6x)

17, all he's ever seen 
Is a little in between the lies 
It's kind of funny how a mind 
Can keep living in denial.

18 is a very strange scene 
He's still playing with the past 
Expelled, maybe someone could've helped 
If someone had known to ask.

~Chorus

"Don't say nothin', shh."

19 and he's innocently 
Parked right beside a school.
He stares at a boy sitting there 
And the boy stares at him too.
He walks over,
He needs closure.---Lyrics submitted by Dick.
