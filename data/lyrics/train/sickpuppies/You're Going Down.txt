Define your meaning of war

To me it's what we do when we're bored

I feel the heat comin off of the blacktop

And it makes me want it more

Because I'm hyped up, outta control

If it's a fight I'm ready to go

I wouldn't put my money on the other guy

If you know what I know that i know

It's been a long time comin
And the tables' turned around
Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin', it's a little different now
Cause one of us is goin'
ONE OF US IS GOIN' DOWN!!!

Define your meaning of fun

To me it's when we're gettin' done

I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop

So get ready for another one

Let's take a trip down memory lane

The words circulate in my brain

You can treat this like another all I'm saying

But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

It's been a long time comin
And the tables' turned around
Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin', it's a little different now
Cause one of us is goin'
ONE OF US IS GOIN' DOWN!!!

This is hardly worth fighting for

But it;s the little petty shit that I can't ignore

With my fist in your face, and your face on the floor

It'll be a long time comin
But you got the message now
Cause I was never goin'
Yeah, you're the one that's going down!

One of us is going down
I'm not runnin', it's a little different now
Cause one of us is goin'
ONE OF US IS GOIN' DOWN!!!

ONE OF US IS GOIN' DOWN!!!---Lyrics submitted by jared.
