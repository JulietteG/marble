Waiting for another line
Because you throw them at me all the time
Gotta get away from all her lies
And i gotta get away from mine

(Chorus)
Tell me where to go
When fate won't deliver
Cause I can't forgive her
When I let her know
This pain I been living
Will her next collision be me?

Brings this situation down
And her temper's always on the rise
I'm living what I've seen before
Well I won't take this anymore
It's time to hold this to the light

(Chorus)
Tell me where to go
When fate won't deliver
Cause I can't forgive her
When I let her know
This pain I been living
Will her next collision be me?

Cause her mental prison
Is not my decision
So I'm cutting my loses this time
I'm no longer living
Through her tunnel vision


(Chorus)
Tell me where to go
When fate won't deliver
Cause I can't forgive her
When I let her know
This pain I been living
Will her next collision be me?

Gotta get away from, gotta get away, gotta get away this time



(Chorus)
Tell me where to go
When fate won't deliver
Cause I can't forgive her
When I let her know
This pain I been living
Will her next collision be me?---Lyrics submitted by Kay Peters.
