I waited for you yesterday
I waited and missed the last train
I watied to say that I'd fallen in love with your way

I waited for you yesterday
Eventually walked home in the rain
I waited to see
If you felt the same for me

[Chorus]:
But you don't
And you won't
Go against
Your asshole father
Going broke
Quitting dope
For your folks
Why did I even bother?
Why did I?

I waited for minds to change
Pointing their fingers of blame
It's not my fault you're ashamed
Of how you feel

[Chorus]

Cause you don't
Just admit it
Cause you won't
Just admit it
Just admit it
Just admit it
Just admit it
Just admit it

I called you a whore
And broke down your door
But you don't even hate me!

And how could I heal
When you won't even feel? 
Why won't you hate me?!

[Chrous]

But you don't 
Cause you're nothing
But broken down daddy's 
Little daughter
AREN'T YA?

Going broke
Quitting dope 
For your folks
Why did I even bother?
Why did I?---
