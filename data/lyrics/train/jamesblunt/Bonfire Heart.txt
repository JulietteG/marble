Your mouth is a revolver firing bullets in the sky. 
Your love is like a soldier, loyal till you die. 
And Ive been looking at the stars for a long, long time. 
Ive been putting out fires all my life. 
Everybody wants a flame, but they dont want to get burnt. 
And today is our turn. 

Days like these lead to, nights like this leads to love like ours, 
You light the spark in my bonfire heart. 
People like us, we dont need that much. 
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts. 

This world is getting colder. Strangers passing by. 
No one offers you a shoulder. No one looks you in the eye. 
But Ive been looking at you for a long, long time. 
Just trying to break through, trying to make you mine. 
Everybody wants a flame, they dont want to get burnt 
Well today is our turn. 

Days like these lead to nights like this leads to love like ours, 
You light a spark in my bonfire heart. 
People like us, we dont need that much. 
Just someone that starts, starts a spark in our bonfire hearts. 

Hmm, our bonfire hearts 
our bonfire hearts 
Uh, our bonfire hearts 
You light the spark 

People like us, we dont need that much. 
Just someone that starts, starts a spark in our bonfire hearts. 

Days like these lead to nights like this leads to love like ours, 
You light a spark in my bonfire heart. 
People like us, we dont need that much. 
Just someone that starts, starts a spark in our bonfire hearts. 
our bonfire hearts 

Days like these lead to nights like this leads to love like ours,
