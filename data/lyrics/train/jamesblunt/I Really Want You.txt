I really want you,
I really want you.

Many prophets preach on bended knees,
Many clerics wasted wine,
Do the bloodied sheets,
On those cobbled streets mean,
I have wasted time.

Are there silver shores on paradise?
Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a faraway land,
My enemy untold.

I really want you to really want me
But I really dont know if you can do that.
I know you want to know whats right
But I know its so hard for you to do that.
Times running out as often it does
And often dictates if you can do that.
And fate cant break this feeling inside,
Thats burning up through my veins.

I really want you.
I really want you.
I really want you. 
Now.

No matter what I say or do,
The message isnt getting through,
And youre listening to the sound,
Of my breaking heart.

I really want you,
I really want you.

Is a poor man rich in solitude,
Or will mother earth complain,
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day but,
Lady luck for rain.

They say a million people bow and scrape,
To an effigy of gold,
I saw life begin,
And the ship were in,
And history unfold.

I really want you to really want me
But I really dont know if you can do that.
I know you want to know whats right
But I know its so hard for you to do that.
Times running out as often it does
And often dictates if you can do that.
And fate cant break this feeling inside,
Thats burning up through my veins.

I really want you.
I really want you.
I really want you. 
Now.

No matter what I say or do,
The message isnt getting through,
And youre listening to the sound,
Of my breaking heart.---Lyrics submitted by Joseph.
