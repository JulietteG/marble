Twas in Dublin's fair city, where girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she pushed her wheel barrow, through streets broad and narrow
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive alive-oh!"
Alive alive-oh-oh, alive alive-oh-oh!
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive alive-oh!"

She was a fish monger, and sure twas no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they eached wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive alive-oh!"
Alive alive-oh-oh, alive alive-oh-oh!
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive alive-oh!"

She died of a fever and noone could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive alive-oh!"
Alive alive-oh-oh, alive alive-oh-oh!
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive alive-oh!"---Lyrics submitted by Jody.
