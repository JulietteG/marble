Got this Information I don't want to act upon
Taking advantage of the situation would be wrong
All the wrong reasons
I give myself away

Every time you walk into the room 
I can't hide the way I feel for you
I trip over my words
And end up feeling like a fool
When you tell me he's the one for you

But you don't hear him talk
You don't know his game
His intentions and desires aren't the same

Chorus
Pride ego selfishness
Trying to fill some emptiness
Girl he's making love to you 
For all the wrong reasons
I could give him up so easily
And move in with my sympathy
But i don't want you here with me
For all the wrong reasons

You trust me like a friend
And tell me all the little things he does
He makes you feel like your'e the lucky one
But secrets I can't tell
The way he's playing you around
It's killing me to watch it all go down

If you could read his mind
See behind his eyes
You'll know yourself
His love is just a lie.

Chorus

Got this information I don't want to act upon 
Taking advantage of the situation would be wrong
And i wish I never knew
What he's doing to you

Chorus-Out---Lyrics submitted by Matthew.
