For so long
You and me were findin' each other for so long
And the feelin' that I feel for you is more than strong girl
Take it from me
If you give a little more than your askin' for
Your love will turn the key

Darlin' I
I would wait forever for those lips of wine
And build my world around you darlin'
This love will shine girl
Watch it and see
If you give a little more than you're askin' for
Your love will turn the key

[chorus:]
I-I-I
I just wanna be your everything
Open up the heavens in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string
Oh-ohh
I, if I stay here without you darlin' I would die
I want you layin' in the love I have to bring
I'll do anything to be your everything

For so long
You and me were findin' each other for so long
And the feelin' that I feel for you is more than strong girl
Take it from me
If you give a little more than you're askin' for
Your love will turn the key

[chorus 3x until fade]---Lyrics submitted by Cecily.
