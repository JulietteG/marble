Ill never leave you
But fate has come to silence me
Darkness is all that I see
I cannot reach you
And soon the earth will cover me
Its become so hard to breathe

Forever is waiting
The final steps your taking
Will soon be buried in the sands

All of the battles
They say we won
They leave another 1000 lives undone
Another 1000 lives undone

Forever is waiting
The final steps youre taking
Will soon be buried in the sands

Youre gone but not forgot
Another Hero Lost
The sorrow builds with every passing
All the lessons that you taught
And all the life you brought
Lives on in the eyes of your son

[Guitar Solo]

Forever Is waiting
The final steps youre taking
Will soon be buried in the sands

Youre gone but not forgot
Another Hero Lost
The sorrow builds with every passing
All the lessons that you taught
And all the life you brought
Lives on in the eyes of your son.---Lyrics submitted by Mark.
