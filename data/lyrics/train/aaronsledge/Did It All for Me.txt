1st verse
I'll never know why you gave us your son
I'll never why he saved all of us
Out of all the things that you could've done
You decided to give your life for all of us

Chorus
You didn't have to do it
but I'm glad you did
You could have called ten thousand angels
angels to save .....you from that rugged cross
but I'm glad you stayed there
and you DID IT ALL FOR ME

Repeat 1st Verse

Chorus
You didn't have to do it
but I'm glad you did
You could have called ten thousand angels
angels to save .....you from that rugged cross
but I'm glad you stayed there
and you DID IT ALL FOR ME

B-section
If I had to make sense of all of this
I would still come out empty because it is
too much for me to bare
but all I know is that I'm glad you did oh

Chorus
You didn't have to do it
but I'm glad you did
You could have called ten thousand angels
angels to save .....you from that rugged cross
but I'm glad you stayed there
and you DID IT ALL FOR ME---Lyrics submitted by kalyn.
