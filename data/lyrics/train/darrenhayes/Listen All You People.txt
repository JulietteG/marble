Listen all you people.
All you lonely and deserted.
The departed and the broken hearted.
I've got time for you.

You can call your friends
For we're headed on a journey.

All the lonely the mad.
All the bad apple sad got a message for you.
Nothing's peaches and cream.
Nothing's quite what it seems.
They've been lying to you.

All you unhappy wives.
All you pregnant brides.
All you geeks and you queens.
All you sick and you poor.
All the drunks on the floor.
Well I'm calling to you.

Listen all you people.
All you lonely and deserted.
The departed and the broken hearted.
I've got time for you

You can call your friends
For we're headed on a journey.
Weve been held down.
Weve been pushed down now were through.

All the freaks all the queers.
All the phobes and the steers.
Well it's time to give in.
There's a crack in the door.
It's ok to want more you've been dying for years.
All the races you lost.
All the loveless that cost you the heart on your sleeve.
All the stifled reactions.
The screams youve been acting like no one can hear you.

Listen all you people.
All you lonely and deserted.
The departed and the broken hearted.
I've got time for you.

Sending out a message
Gotta get to you.
Sending out a message
Is it coming through?

Listen all you people are you lonely and deserted?

Listen all you people are you lonely and deserted?
Weve been held down.
Weve been pushed down now were through.

Listen all you people are you lonely and deserted?---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
