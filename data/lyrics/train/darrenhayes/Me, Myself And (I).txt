I'm kinda reeling.
Dj vu feeling.
We've been together in another life.
Got me extended.
That network's ended.
The future echoes with your memory.
Now darlin I don't know what the future will bring
But I am willing sing till I drop.
Now baby I don't know how it happened to be
But when we met it was like future shock.

Tell me what to do.
Me myself and (i)
Gonna take a time machine to get it right.
And it's so cruel.
I wanna take you home.
I'm gonna speed those hands of time right up
So I don't leave here all alone.
Woo Hoo!

The death of romance.
Thought there was no chance.
Then you appeared right in front me.
I got to thinking.
Loneliness sinking.
I felt a cloud lifting over me.
Now darlin I don't know what the future will hold
But I'm not willing to do as I'm told.
Now baby I don't care how it happened to be
I see my future is right before me.

Tell me what to do.
Me myself and (i)
Gonna take a time machine to get it right.
And it's so cruel.
I want to take you home.
I'm gonna speed those hands of time right up
So I don't leave here all alone.
Woo Hoo!
Woo Hoo!
Woo Hoo!

Did you ever get the feeling that universe is leaning
It's accelerating it will never stop?
Did you ever wonder if the number one divide by zero
Is infinity if that's the case then what?
If imaginary numbers are abstractions of the real thing
Then could someone make the clock of time stop.
If we were always meant to be together like forever then it
Must have been a future shock.

I don't know what the future will bring but I am willing to sing 'till I drop.

What to do?
Me myself and (i).
Gonna take a time machine to get it right.
And it's so cruel.
I wanna take you home.
I'm gonna speed those hands of time right up
So I don't leave here all alone.
Woo Hoo!---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
