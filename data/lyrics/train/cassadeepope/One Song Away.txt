Late at night
Can't go to sleep
It's just me and the radio
Every single melody
Is wrecking me
And I know I'm getting close
To losing all control
And picking up the phone

I'm one song away
From breaking down and calling you up
And each one that plays is telling me that I'm still in love
Every word in every line
Is singing how I feel tonight
It's all I can take
Now I'm one song away
I'm just one song away

I could turn it off or tune it out
But I'm too gone for saving now so
What's the use
No matter what I try to do, I'm back and forth
I toss and turn and think of you
The later that it gets
The more I wanna give in

I'm one song away
From breaking down and calling you up
And each one that plays is telling me that I'm still in love
Every word in every line
Is singing how I feel tonight
It's all I can take
Now I'm one song away
I'm just one song away

I'm one song away

Oh, and every word in every line
Is singing how I feel tonight
It's all I can take
Now I'm one song away
I'm just one song away

Late at night
Can't go to sleep
It's just me and the radio ---
