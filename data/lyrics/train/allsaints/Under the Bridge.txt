Sometimes I feel, like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of cities
Lonely as I am, together we cry, we cry we cry

I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Oh...oh oh

I drive on the streets, 'cos he's my companion
I walk through his field 'cos he know who I am
He sees my good deeds and he kisses me windy

I never worry...now that is a lie

I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Oh... Oh... oh oh

It's hard to believe, there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have his love, the city he loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love...take me all the way....

Repeat chorus x2
