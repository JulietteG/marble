Let me introduce myself (Big Bang)
(Yeah)

Are you ready for the show?

I'll be ready in an hour, jump in the shower
crispy and clean now I got the power
blasting music from my speakers
T-shirts fresh, brand new sneakers

Ready to flow
ready to go
ready for the spotlight
ready for the show
let me tell you something that you already know
i am a hard-working man
and i work for my fans

Chorus)
Girl, I love your style, love your smile
it's the truth to be, only mine
be only mine (for sure)
I cant let it go,
I dont know What you're doin to me
(yeah)
you are so fine (Uh huh)
ooh, you are so fine (Let's go)

Gettin hot in the club, I can see they want some more
(I will give you more,
I'm your number one)
Once i get up
i will rock
never stop
you can be sure
yeah you can be sure
I'm your number 1

I (uh), you know what (yes)
you know what (yo)
i'm your number one

Crazy hot, mad party
Shorty drop it low for me You can keep me company
Your look sweet smell like honey

I need a girl who is in it for me.
not for the money
not for the fame
not for the glory
not for the name
It aint easy as long as youre sayin this

Chorus)
Boy, I love your style, love your smile
it's the truth to be only mine
be only mine (for sure)
I can't let it go
I don't know what you're doing to me
you are so fine
ooh, you are so fine

Gettin hot in the club, I can see they want some more
I will give you more,
I'm your number one
Once i get up
