No
 Don't
 Give me your hand
 I can save you from the fall
 Go
 I'm in your shadow
 Run until your feet are aching to the bone

 I see you looking back at me
 As this might be the end of me
 Misfortune in my history
 And even more awaiting me
 Tired of such controversies
 Sometimes I long for sweet release
 I've found a place that welcomes me
 A greener grass and bluer sea
 Free from all the sudden grief
 No clenching fists no gritting teeth
 I feel the freedom as I breathe
 A nature and its calm relief

 It all comes to life right before your eyes

 And I wander through ideals
 Reflecting all I know and how it falls into focus
 It seems my progression lays behind this wall
 So I plant a seed and lead erosion to the wall
 And lead erosion to it all

 And I'll be here
 Looking for purpose in the sun
 And I'll be ever here

 The horizon bears such a beauty
 We'll never know how much we can't see
 Your atheist terse solemnity
 It bruises me

 And it all comes to life
 Why do I still feel?
 Dead inside---Lyrics submitted by nizmo.
