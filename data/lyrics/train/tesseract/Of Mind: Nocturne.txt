Climb (you're dehydrated ).
 Fly (your wings are jaded).
 Cry (you're enervated).
 Die (for what you believe in).
 Try (you've nearly made it).
 Why...

 You're the plague within my dreams;
 Soaring through an atmosphere of an adequate lack of strength,
 (and we're responsible) the truth is that it will end here,
 Denial's an impairment of your fear.
 Can we save us from ourselves? (can we save us from ourselves?)
 This is the saviour and it's form...

 You can break through,
 wake me up,
 tell me it's gone.
 False hope sells lies.
 I won't buy.
 We are still one.
 Let's attempt escape,
 Melancholia will feed,
 We'll admit defeat,
 The vox populi will cease.
 The air is thickening.
 We are drifting.

 You're the plague within my dreams;
 Soaring through an atmosphere of an adequate lack of strength,
 (and we're responsible)(we're responsible!)
 The truth is that it will end here,
 Denial's an impairment of your fear.
 Can we save us from ourselves? (can we save us from ourselves?)
 This is the saviour and it's form...

 What's done is done,
 One more second chance would be enough.
 Only on the brink can we see so clearly.
 YYYEEEEEEAAAAHHHHH!

 Wake me up
 Wake me up
 Wake me up
 Wake me up---Lyrics submitted by nizmo.
