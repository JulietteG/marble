This rhapsody of tension has lifted from my chest
As my flying cannot destroy the nest
It is merely a new chapter of this dream
Shining brightly does not quell the flame
It merely adds to the symphony of colour
That is this tapestry we weave

And I dont believe it sings any louder or soars any higher
But it will not fly at all if not given freedom to be

Bluebird fly
Bluebird fly
Bluebird fly
Bluebird fly

At each turn there's more to ignore, more to pretend isn't there
More of the cons on the lists I fear they make
My wings slowly curl out of this cracked shell cause I need to be taught
I need you to hold my hand, baby steps on this new flight

And I dont believe it sings any louder or soars any higher
But it will not fly at all if not given freedom to be

Bluebird fly
Bluebird fly
Bluebird fly
Bluebird fly

I hope you dont want to pretend it's all the way it was
Cause I cried more than you think of
But now Im trying to let go of our past
The nest we've made is stronger than you think
And though we all fly we still come home
Guilt is a dark room I cannot live there

And I dont believe it sings any louder or soars any higher
But it will not fly at all if not given freedom to be

Bluebird fly
Bluebird fly
Bluebird fly
Bluebird fly
