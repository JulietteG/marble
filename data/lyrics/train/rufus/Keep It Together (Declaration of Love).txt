When in the course of nature
Two people trying to get along
It take much love,
and even more understanding
So many little things can go wrong

We must disagree, many times
That's just a little fact of life
but let us always know
that WE are more important than you or me
and we can keep it together
in all kind of weather

oh whether, things look cloudy, or bright
we know ( we know )
it will be alright
when we see ( we see )
our guiding light
no sooner said than done

Let's keep it together
Let's keep it together
keep it to
keep it together
Let's keep it together

When in the course of emotions
we fall in love
sometime our heart goes one way
and our mind goes another
as we fall, and fall, and fall, and fall

but to fall in love
is to rise in love
and to shine like the sun
oh oh oh oh let the bad thoughts go
let the good part grow
let us become one
and love will be done

oh whether,( whether ) things look cloudy, or bright
we know ( we know )
it will be alright
when we see ( we see )
our guiding light
no sooner said than done

oh whether,( whether ) things look cloudy, or bright
we know ( we know )
it will be alright
when we see ( we see )
our guiding light
no sooner said than done

oh whether,( whether ) things look cloudy, or bright
we know ( we know )
it will be alright ---
