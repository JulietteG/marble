I'm walkin' to the sound, 
The blood that moves around inside me. 

The beat drops in my heart, 
Below my feet the stars can lift me. 

The lanes are all clear 
i've always dreamed that i'd be here, 
but this seems to weird. 

So close i can taste it,iv'e waited all my life (for this) 
And i don't wanna waste it, i've chased this all my life.(i'm so close). 

This town will test your fate, 
will put you in your place and leave you. 

Where everyone's a name and everythings a game of who's who. 

The card are in play. 

I'm sittin on a hand that no one can take away. 

So close i can taste it,iv'e waited all my life (for this) 
And i don't wanna waste it, i've chased this all my life.(i'm so close). 

So close ,Close close 
I've been so close all my life. 

I'm in need and I believe that i'll find a way somehow all my life. 

The lanes are all clear , 
i'd always dreamed that i'd be 
So close i can taste it,iv'e waited all my life (for this) 
And i don't wanna waste it, i've chased this all my life.(i'm so close). 

All the ways i've been shut out 

yeah, iv'e been lost and found, 
the tears and the break downs 
Have made me stronger now 

I'm in need and I believe that i'll find a way somehow all my life.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
