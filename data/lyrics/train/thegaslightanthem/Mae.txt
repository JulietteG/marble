Stay the same, don't ever change
Cuz I'd miss your ways
With your Bette Davis eyes
And your mamas party dress
While this city pumps its aching heart for one more drop of blood
We work our fingers down to dust
And we wait for Kingdom Come
With the radio on

Now I wanna see you tonight
Would you come for a drive?
You can lean into me
If you ain't, oh you ain't been in love for a while

I was born beside a river that flows to a raging sea
That will one day serve to quell
Or one day be the death of me
In my faded jeans & faraway eyes & salty carnival kiss
That all my former lovers say
Was once magnificent

I wanna see you tonight
Would you come for a drive?
You can lean into me
If you ain't, oh you ain't 
I wanna see you tonite
Would you come for a drive?
You can lean into me
If you ain't, oh you ain't been in love for a while

Still this city pumps its aching heart for one more drop of blood
We work our fingers down to dust
And we wait for Kingdom Come 
With the radio on
With the radio on

It's been so long Mae, so long
It's been so long Mae, so long
But since the radio was on---Lyrics submitted by Jan Ballerstein.
