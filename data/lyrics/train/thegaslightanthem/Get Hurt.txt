Sometimes I wake up in the morning
Sometimes I dream some more
I keep my wounds without a bandage, baby
As I come stumblin through the door
Spend my nights in dislocation
Talkin to spirits on the floor
I think I came to find the feelin, baby
Between what was mine and what was yours

And I came here to get hurt
Might as well do your worst to me
Have you come here to get hurt?
Have you come to take away from me? From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

I think Im gonna move to California
Mama, can you say a prayer for me?
I heard they dont get so low down
I heard they never bleed
Not like we bleed

I came here to get hurt
Might as well do your worst to me
Have you come here to get hurt?
Have you come to take away from me? From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

And it gets pretty late
And the stations will change
And the things once in order
Now seem so strange
Once I could tell
All the hurt apart from myself
Now all I can see is the need, the need that

I came here to get hurt
Might as well do your worst to me
Have you come here to get hurt?
Have you come to take away from me? From me, from me
Might as well do your worst to me

And maybe you needed a change
And maybe I was in the way
Maybe some things they stay
And some things go away
And maybe I was mine
And maybe you were not the same---
