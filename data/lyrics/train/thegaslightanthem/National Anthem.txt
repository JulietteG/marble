I never will forget you my American love
And I'll always remember you wild as they come
And no, if I saw you I'd pretend not to know
The place where you were in my heart is now closed
I already live with too many ghosts

Now everybody lately is living up in space
Flying thru transmissions on invisible airwaves
With everything discovered just waiting to be known
What's left for God to teach from His throne
And who will forgive us when He's gone

So take what you need now honey
And do what you like
Don't worry 'bout me mama I'm alright

And I can't stand the weather 
No, I never liked the rain
We'd drink on the job 
And then we'd go home early
And I remember she used to look so good in that dress
Now she just screams how I promised her more than this
Take it easy baby, it ain't over yet

So take what you need now honey
And do what you like
Don't worry 'bout me mama I'm alright
And if there's something you need
And if there's something you find
Whatever gets you thru the night
Whatever gets you thru the night

And I never will forget you my American love
And I'll always remember you wild as they do come---Lyrics submitted by Jan Ballerstein.
