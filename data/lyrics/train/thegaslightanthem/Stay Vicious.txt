Now, I feel just like a stranger
I dont sleep at all anymore
In the arms that used to hold me
Well, now theyve done me harm

And I feel just like a murderer
And I feel just like a gun
Ive been shaking in the hands
Of somebody whos finally had enough

As you step out into the city
No one to find you or recognize
As your black heels kick out the beat
Of my heart in perfect time
Singing, la la la la la-la-la-la
Look at you saving my life
Singing, la la la la la-la-la-la
Tonight youre saving my life, yeah

Now, Ive had the saints and patience
And I wait on a telephone
I have pills for this, tabs for that
And something that used to resemble the soul
So wont anybody take my hand
And wont anybody ease my ache
I still love rock and roll
And I still call somebody baby

As you step out into the city
No one to find you or recognize
As your black heels kick out the beat
Of my heart in perfect time
Singing, la la la la la-la-la-la
Look at you saving my life
Singing, la la la la la-la-la-la
Tonight youre saving my life, yeah

As you step out into the city
No one to find you or recognize
As your black heels kick out the beat
Of my heart in perfect time
Singing, la la la la la-la-la-la
Look at you saving my life
Singing, la la la la la-la-la-la
Tonight youre saving my life

Singing, la la la la la-la-la-la
Leave it on the end of the knife
Singing, la la la la la-la-la-la
Tonight youre saving my life, yeah---
