You hear it every time
One day that tears are dry
In time the pain subsides
And then you start to live again

I know you're asking why
This seems to keep happening
You give her everything
To find yourself alone again

If I could go through this pain
I fear I would
I know it's not because we're the same
I fear I could
Because nothing in the world is worse
Than watching you lose your faith
Now I can think of someone who deserves
Real love a thousand times more

Real love
A thousand times more
Real love
A thousand times more
Real love
A thousand times more
Real love

I wish there was a way
To reassure your heart
Now I can promise anything
Except to say this hurt will pass

I know right now it seems
You've got to fight to breathe
As long as I'm alive I'll be
The air to breathe

You back
I'll be the one to bring
You back
I'll be the air to breathe
You back
I'll be there to bring
You back

If I could go through this pain
I fear I would
I know it's not because we're the same
I fear I could
Because nothing in the world is worse
Than watching you lose your faith
Now I can think of someone who deserves
Real love a thousand times more

Real love
A thousand times more
Real love
A thousand times more
Real love
A thousand times more
Real love---
