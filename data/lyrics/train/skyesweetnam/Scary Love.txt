What is love, my love
Tell me do you know
To me it's dirt and blood and seed
That's how my garden grows

What is this pain inside my veins
It turned to frost
Is there an operation, please
And how much does it cost

This love is a scary love

If I had one day left to live
I'd lock the doors and windows
And keep you in
If I had one day left to live
I'd wrap myself around you
And breathe you in

Scary love
It's a scary love

What is love, my love
Tell me why it burns
Like rage and fire inside of me
It causes no concern

I'm quite used to it
The ashes on my hands
At least I've felt the pain of love
Of what no one understands

This love is a scary love

If I had one day left to live
I'd lock the doors and windows
And keep you in
If I had one day left to live
I'd wrap myself around you
And breathe you in

This love is a scary love
Like birds in the place of doves
Clenched fist in a velvet glove
Like a train running over us
Like being nailed to a cross

If I had one day left to live (if I had one)
I'd keep you in, I'd keep you in
If I had one more day to live
I'd wrap myself around you and breathe you in---Lyrics submitted by Dezzie.
