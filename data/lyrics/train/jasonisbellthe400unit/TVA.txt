I grew up 2 hours north of Birmingham
Me and my daddy used to fish next to Wilson Dam
He told me the stories of Marrow and J W Dan
When i got a little older, I wouldn't, now daddy came



But I thank G-d for the TVA
Thank G-d for the TVA
Me and my daddy used to bow to the river and pray
Thank G-d for the TVA

When I was 15, me and my girl sat out on the lock
watching the racoons and terrapins dance on the rock
She let me put my hand up under her shirt
I wanted her, so bad it hurt
So I thank G-d for the TVA
Thank G-d for the TVA
While me and my baby used to hide out and wait on the day
Thank G-d for the TVA

My granddaddy told me, when he was just seventy-so
His daddy lost work,and they didn't have a road to hold---Lyrics submitted by Frankenschmidt.
