Yeah, yeah, yeah look at god!
Yeah, yeah, yeah look at god!
Yeah, yeah, yeah look at god!
(wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist)

Said she didn't wanna keep it
Look at God!
Guess that will be our little secret...
Hold that down (hold that back) (x4)
Pack after pack all summer
Gas guzzler I remind her of her hummer
She remind me of Corolla
Hot boxing in the middle of August windows rolled up

Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
I want my wrists so cold pneumonia in my fist
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Never had to whip a brick but I get the gist
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
I want my wrists so cold pneumonia in my fist

My wrists done turned so cold
My arm got runny nose
I flip it for the high and get it for the low
I'm booked for all these shows
I cook for all these hoes
We turned a neighborhood kitchen into a 5 star stove
Super chef Makonnen might sprinkle serotonin
Be careful when you rolling because my wrist so goddamn potent
Oh bitch is you snoring?
Will wake up in the morning
Because wrist game stupid
And the wrist be going like

Ok, I hurt my fucking wrist tryna jizz on your bitch
I hurt my fucking wrist doing donuts in the six
Hey wrist, wrist, wrist man I hurt my fucking wrist
Pulling risk, man you wouldn't understand about this shit
If I catch a opp
I'mma catch a opp
It ain't shit
I ain't from the Chi, this Atlantastan
Boy that's it
Man I'm outside
Man I'm outside
With my old ass
Shit look sad
Man pull up, your fucking pants
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Boy like im hooping hey
Wrist, wrist wrist
Catch your girl if you're losing hey
Wrist, wrist, wrist
All my niggas ready for jail
Wrist, wrist, wrist
But none of us is going to hell
Repent!---
