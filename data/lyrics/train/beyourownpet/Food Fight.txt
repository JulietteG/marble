Lunch time is just not fair hot dog mustard in your hair 
Sucks for the janitor food on! sucks for the janitor food on! food on! 
Food Fight!

Crash a six year old's birthday party, throw the cake in their face make him grab their mommy
You gotta stand your fuckin ground fight on! you gotta stand your fuckin ground
Fight on! Fight on! 
Food Fight!

Pizza party on a friday night, who would of known its gonna be a Food Fight!
Hawiian style and lots of meat goin in your pants and then to your feet
Extra cheese, in your face, don't give up you gotta keep up the pace 
A pizza party on a friday night, who would have known its gonna be a Food Fight!

Lunch time is just not fair hot dog mustard in your hair 
Sucks for the janitor, food on! sucks for the janitor, food on!---Lyrics submitted by justine.
