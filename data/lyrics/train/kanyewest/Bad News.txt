Didn't you know, I was waitin on you
Waitin' on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waitin' on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When'd you decide to break the rules?
Cause I just heard some real bad news

People talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you, how long have you known dude?
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When'd you decide to break the rules?
Cause I just heard some real bad news

Real bad news [x3]

Oh you just goin' keep another, no you wont
Oh you just goin' keep it like you never knew
Oh you just goin' keep another love for you
Oh you just goin' keep em like you never knew
While im waitin on a dream that'll never come true
Oh you just goin' keep em like you never knew
My face turned to stone when I heard the news

Whats on the news?
