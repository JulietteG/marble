I'm not sure anymore (more) (more) who is knocking at my door (door) (door)
all the friends that I know their but so sorry and sure

CHORUS
I don't wanna say goodbye to you so I'll just say goodnight to you
My people wonder why to you I'm just gonna say goodnight

VERSE 1
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could re-live it
Me and my grand parents on a field trip
and I'm a little kid trying to test the exhibits but 
In a faithful I get to get a hold of that
Men I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I would know the laugh
Men, I wouldn't let a moment pass
What would it mean when you dream that you're falling
What would it mean when you dream that you're balling
What would it mean when you never dream at all and u don't really know
but you can't recall them
It's all a fight to get a chance to say hi to 
people you never got the chance to say hi to
Maybe you could put them up out of your dream into real life if you try to
So close (so close) So far (so far) so far (so far) no cigar (no cigar)
you can't dwell on the past all we got is today so Ima live like there is no tomorrow

CHORUS

VERSE 2
If I promp my uncle live through you 
dream beautiful and unusual
wake up like every day new to you
stay true to you a whole musical
my uncle live through you
dream beautiful and unusual
wake up like every day new to you
stay true to you a whole musical

CHORUS

I'm not sure anymore (more) (more) who is knocking at my door (door) (door)
all the friends that I know their but are so sorry and sure---Lyrics submitted by Richmond.
