Im livin in the 21st century
Doin something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the 80s, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his own theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
(21st century schizoid man)

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We aint got nothin to lose, mafucka, we rollin
Huh? Mafucka, we rollin
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin
Huh? I see you in the mornin
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
Til then, fuck that, the worlds ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
Im an asshole? You niggas got jugs
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice, brought the Dodies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, fuckin gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin up with me
Takin my inner child, Im fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece

Nigga, no one man should have all that power
The clocks tickin, I just count the hours
Stop trippin, Im trippin off the power
Til then, fuck that, the worlds ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)

Holy, powers, Austin, Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin nation
They say I was the obamanation of Obamas nation
Well, thats a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit, Im killin this shit
I know damn well yall feelin this shit
I dont need yo pussy, bitch, Im on my own dick
I aint gotta power trip, who you goin home with?
How Ye doin? Im survivin
I was drinkin earlier, now Im drivin
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin?
I got the power, make yo life so excitin (So excitin)

Now thisll be a beautiful death
Jumpin out the window
Lettin everything go
Lettin everything go

Now thisll be a beautiful death
Jumpin out the window
Lettin everything go
Lettin everything go

Now thisll be a beautiful death
Jumpin out the window
Lettin everything go
Lettin everything go

Now thisll be a beautiful death
Jumpin out the window
Lettin everything go
Lettin everything go

You got the power to let power come---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
