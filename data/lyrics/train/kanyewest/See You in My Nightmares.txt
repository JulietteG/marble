(Featuring Lil' Wayne)

[Kanye West]
I'm cold (Yeah), I'm cold (Yeah), I'm cold (Yeah) (Yeah)

[Lil Wayne]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh well how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is fair well

[Kanye West]
I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So goodnight, I made it out the door X 4
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road

And that you know
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know...

Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gone do mine
You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine
Okay I got you out my mind
And The night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well now you know...
Tell everybody everybody that you know!
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know

[Lil Wayne]
I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
See you in my nightmare, oh but how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is fair well

Baby girl I'm finished
I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented
I really thought we meant it
But Now we just repenting
And Now we just resenting
The clouds is in my vision
Look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you
Girl we through
You think your shit don't stink but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you with me no more
Now tell everybody that you know
That you know!

[Kanye West]
That you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know
That you know
Tell everyone that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing that you know
That you know...---Lyrics submitted by Kharin.
