Centuries,
I respect them, please,
Come on!

I know now,
But it isn't easy.
And I transform, into energy.
With your mouth, ooh (x3)

Let them fly(?),
Movement overflows,
Come on!

I know now,
But it isn't easy.
And I transform, into energy.
With your mouth, ooh (x3)

Let them fly...
The rest is like a cup of tea.
And I transform, into energy.
With your mouth, ooh (x3)

Energy, oh (x4)
I transform, into energy... (x4)

(With your mouth)
I know now,
But it isn't easy.
And I transform, into energy.
With your mouth, ooh (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Heather Carvellas.
