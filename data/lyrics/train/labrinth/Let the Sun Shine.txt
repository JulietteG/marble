I feel a cold flush going through my hair
And hey you know what
I don't even care
The time has passed me by
It's gone with the wind
It's all because the sun shined once again
Now the party's on
Everybody's there
And if you don't know anyone
You'll still meet some new friends
That's the way it is
When I have myself a drink
All because the sun shines once again

Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby

So turn the lights off
Ain't no one afraid
When the night comes
It'll be just like the day
And without the day
I am glowing from within
All because the sun shined once again
So play that sweet tune
Play it through the air
And the volume
Blazing up
Don't you ask me twice
You know I'm gonna bid
All because the sun shined once again

Let the sunshine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby

I know that the world is gonna smile again
When we go from the darkness into the light
Ohhh

Let the sun shine...

Let the sun shine...

Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let the sunshine
Let the sunshine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Yeah eh eyy yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
