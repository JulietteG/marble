When I talk you listen, when I move you watch
I wonder what would happen if I told you what I thought
When I tell you secrets, how they all get out
Trust is everything so what's it all about?

You don't know bout, you don't care bout anything but me
so get out of my life, outta my way
I don't care what you say
I'm loosing this fight day after day
I'm not backing down, 
cuz baby i'm here to stay (here to stay)
cuz baby i'm here to stay (here to stay)
cuz baby i'm here to stay

When I signed up to play your little game
I never had expected it would turn out quite this way
You dressed me all pretty I was hanging by the strings
waiting waiting waiting for the next big thing

You don't know bout, you don't care bout anything but me
so get out of my life, outta my way
I don't care what you say
I'm loosing this fight day after day
I'm not backing down, 
cuz baby i'm here to stay (here to stay)
cuz baby i'm here to stay (here to stay)
cuz baby i'm here

you can't tell me what to do and
you can't tell me what to say and
you can't tell me what to do and
you can't tell me what to say and
you can't tell me what to do and
you can't tell me what to say
anymore! anymore!

so get out of my life, outta my way
I don't care what you say
I'm loosing this fight day after day
I'm not backing down, 
cuz baby i'm here 
so get out of my life, outta my way
I don't care what you say
I'm loosing this fight day after day
I'm not backing down, 
cuz baby i'm here to stay(here to stay)
cuz baby i'm here to stay (here to stay)
cuz baby i'm here to stay---Lyrics submitted by Reilly.
