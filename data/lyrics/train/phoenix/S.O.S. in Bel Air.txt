Well, I really got to go now
Phony eyes, and you're not just anyone
Even though we're not supposed to
I would rather be too close to anything
Is it not far to something I don't want

And you can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying [x8]

Alone, alone, alone... [x4]

Crystal opened blue
Why you have a canoe
Crystal opened blue
Do you need another one?
Someone to talk to?

Put my name in your list
S.O.S. in Bel Air!

When tired, you're no fun
When idols are boredom to everyone
When every piece of every costume
A stolen mess and I recall the pretty things
Is it the last of me or lesson 1?

And you can't cross the line
But you can't stop trying [x8]

Alone, alone, alone... [x4]

Crystal opened blue
Why you have a canoe
Crystal opened blue
Do you need another one?
Someone to talk to?

Put my name on your list
S.O.S. in Bel Air! ---Lyrics submitted by tyler lloyd.
