City and desert coexist
Depending on the things youre wearing
White lie binoculars
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want me

Theyll teach yourself not to resist
Too much intention Presbyterian
Mentulate testosterone
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want me

Cool
Im just trying to be cool
Its all because of you
So tonight aint better too
Were all gone

Oh girlfriend business says it all
You cant go wrong
Is innocence a word where youre from?
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want it all

Two dozen pink and white binoculars
Why, why I got no problems to show
To part-time holy bachelors
Tell them that you want me
Tell them that you want me

Cool
Im just trying to be cool
Its all because of you
Something that aint better too
With no gone

Oh girlfriend business says it all
You cant go wrong
Can women sound cynical where youre from?
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want it all

Ooh, son, I dont care where youre from
Nothings that personal
There is no physical evidence
of cannibal boyfriends ---
