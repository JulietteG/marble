Dally used to come for me.
Go on mister, get well.
Dally wasn't thinking that you know I'm good.
Don't worry cause I'm not the kind to kiss and tell.

Dally using cherry trees,
I don't recall them anyway.

So as long no one there going to wear out two inches in the sane?
Look what you wasted.

When the lights are coming out
And I come down in your room.
Our daily compromising is written in; your signed armistice.
And when the lights are coming out
And I come down in your room.
Well well, the sign is always, here is your signed armistice.

It's time to fall out
And let the heater out.
Look west and this plane's propeller is in the middle of the coast.
When ambitions are low

Head on close, hang on before you lose control.
We ought to go
And look how to rip it off, send the phone message
Some love is, no, it ain't gonna wear out
To which is all the same
What else is wasted

When the lights are coming out
And I come down in your room
Our daily compromise, it is
Written in your signed armistice
And when the lights are coming out
And I come down in your room
Well well the sign is always
Here is your signed armistice

Fallin' out, he's in a rush, fallin' out, he's goin in, fallin out, he's in a rush
Keep your promises
Fallin' out, he's in a rush, fallin' out, he's goin in, fallin out he's in a rush
Fallin' out he's always, Fallin' out, he's in a rush
Keep your promises
Fallin' out, he's in a rush, Fallin' out, he's always---Lyrics submitted by Jasmin.
