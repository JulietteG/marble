What Happened?
Why Don't People Look At Me The Same No More

[ Massari:]

Weinek Ya Dunya Wein?
Were Living Life In The Shadows
The Rain And The Clouds Won't Clear
Tryin To Survive This Battle

Weinek Ya Dunya Wein?
Why Do Our Dreams Get Shattered
Why Is There So Much Hate
Let people Die Like It Don't Matter

Weinek Ya Dunya Wein?
Everybody Get Together
We Need The Truth Right Now
We Cant Take No More Pain
Keep Our Heads High, Gotta Try
To Make It Through Some How

Waynik Ya Dunya Wein?
We Cant Stand By And Watch 
The Whole World Fall Right Down
And All We Do Is Hope For A Change
Im Closin My Eyes Tryna Fade Away

[Belly:]
Woo
Im Tryin To Relax Here
I Feel Like The World's Fallin' Off Of The Axes
We All Know About Where Im From But The Fact Is
U Think It's All Sand And Cactus
A World Of Killers And Terrorist, Suicide Bombers
Ossamas Screamin Death Threats In Arabic
They Don't Tell You About The Treasures We Inherited (It's Beautiful)
We Got The Whole World To Share It With
The Rocks Garden, The Pyramids Egypt
Palestinian Soil, The Birth Place Of Jesus
(Lebanon)
The Accomplishments Of Pheonicians
Most Prophets Come From These Regions
I Keep Trying To Swallow My Pride, But It Hurts Though
The Vicious Circle Of The Earth As It Turns Slow
Sit Back And Let The Shisha Burn Slow
We Need Help, I Ask Myself Where'd The World Go?

[Massari:]

Weinek Ya Dunya Wein?
Everybody Get Together
We Need The Truth Right Now
We Cant Take No More Pain
Keep Our Heads High, Gotta Try
To Make It Through Some How

Waynik Ya Dunya Wein?
We Cant Stand By And Watch 
The Whole World Fall Right Down
And All We Do Is Hope For A Change
Im Closin My Eyes Tryna Fade Away

[Belly:]

In My Heart Where I Keep The Land, Left Arm Where I Keep The Dove
The Art Work Mean Peace And Love
Don't No Body Got No Love
Our Hearts Should've Froze, To The People With Cold Blood
We Don't Know How Freedom Should Taste
Its The People That Face
The Consequences Of The Leaders' Mistakes
We're Not Evil, We're A People Of Grace
Don't Preach Us, Speak The Truth
So That People Relate
How Many Decades Were Taught For Racism To Fade
And Now U're Gonna Change The Books
Now I Need Permission Any Where I Lay My Foot
Interrigated On The Bases Of The Way I Look
I Don't Gotta Be A Psychic
(We Invented Zero)
Now U Wanna Treat Us Like It
Algebra, The Science Of The Stars, It's Priceless
We Helped Invent Life
How They Got Us Feelin' Lifeless?

[Massari:]
Weinek Ya Dunya Wein?
(Weinek Ya Dunya)
Everybody Get Together
We Need The Truth Right Now
We Cant Take No More Pain
Keep Our Heads High, Gotta Try
To Make It Through Some How

Waynik Ya Dunya Wein?
We Cant Stand By And Watch 
The Whole World Fall Right Down
And All We Do Is Hope For A Change
Im Closin My Eyes Tryna Fade Away---Lyrics submitted by Ranoosh.
