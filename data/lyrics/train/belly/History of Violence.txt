[Intro:]
Middle east 
Lets go 
Chyeaaa 
Got a lot of shit on my chest 
Lot of weight on my shoulders 
too much shit on my mind 
I gotta let it out 
My people need me 
Hah, look, we 

[Verse: 1]
Eighty four, I was born on a war torn corner, 
Jeneen, Falasteen, where the bombs stormed on us, 
Tried to escape but they never fore warned us, 
Wed end up with the weight of the whole world on us, 
Whats the difference between peace and war 
You can make war from peace, but not peace from war, 
Maan, why you think they teach us for, what are speeches for, 
Cant nobody fuckin speak no more, 
Maan, im getting to the point I cant breathe no more, 
Cause all I ever breathe is disease and war, 
Young soldiers die before there seeds are born, 
It go back and forth like somebodys keeping score,
And if i know that means somebody else know, 
We all know that dont mean that help is close. 
I want peace, I guess that makes me a dreamer, 
This is for the victims of the Middle East and Katrina, yeea 

[Hook:]
Do we deserve this, is it worth it, 
Why the fuck they got us feeling like we worthless, 
They do it on purpose, and its working, 
Heyy, I aint tryin to say to be perfect 
We had a history of violence 
We had a history of violence 
We had a history of violence 
We had a history of violence 
We had a history. 

[Verse:2]
We aint askin you to love us, stop tryin to judge us, 
Who made the decision to go ahead and say fuck us, 
What you seeing them hover, 
no matter how high them warplanes fly, Gods above em. 
What happened to Palestinian rights, Lebanese freedom, 
A war aimed at civilian life, 
buildings get shot down, Children go fight, 
millions watch but they keep on killing despite, 
im watching daughters cry, over fathers that die, 
Hit the power plants, no power, no water supply, 
Forget the lies, this is when the truth comes in, 
They hit airports and ports and no food comes in, 
Mind spinning as the worlds revolvin, 
right now we teaching our kids, 
if there is problems only war can solve it 
truth or dare, tell the truth I dare, 
Discount boys with toys like they who dont mayor, 
there is people out there, too broke to give us their 2 cents, 
I speak for them, if you relate I speak for you too then, 
They say peace, but.. we dont have clue when, 
How we let them drop bombs on the UN, 
Tears trickled down my face, This is a war on my race, 
So dont expect me to fall in my place, 
think of the kids, they can't be replaced, 
its a disgrace, over four million civilians displaced, 
tryin to hold back the cries, one hand on his mouth, 
his pops died at eleven, he the man in no house, 
aint no planning it out, this what this land is about, 
and he'll be damned if he let them kick his family out, 
I have seen it, am i dreamin, 
they call us names when they acting like extremists, 
they left us in pieces, thats not what peace is, 
thats not the teachings of Muhammad, Moses, Jesus, 
come on.

Do we deserve this, is it worth it, 
Why the fuck they got us feeling like we worthless, 
They do it on purpose, and its working, 
Heyy, I aint tryin to say to be perfect 
We had a history of violence 
We had a history of violence 
We had a history of violence 
We had a history of violence 
We had a history. 

What happened to our history, 
All the good we have done, 
Yall base your opinions on us, 
based on what 2 percent of 
our religion thinks, 
or the race thinks, 
we lost a million civilians in Iraq, 
thats more people than any terrorist strike ever took, 
we lost more american soldiers 
than we did innocent lives on September 11, 
how does that equal out, 
and so for all of you, 
money, political game, fame. 
What happened to bein civilized people, 
we are a civilization, arent we? 
For all the people that lost their lives in 
Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, 
anywhere else across the world, this is for you.---Lyrics submitted by Ranoosh.
