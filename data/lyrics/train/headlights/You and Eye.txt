You came running with a note in your hand
You Said, You made a promise that i'd understand
But it Wasn't the same at all
No it wasn't the same at all

I'd been waiting since you came by
I thought we were staring eye to eye
But it wasn't the same at all
No it wasn't the same at all(3x's)

You came running with a note in your hand
You said that, you made a promise that i'd understand
But it wasn't the same at all
No it wasn't the same at all(3x's)---Lyrics submitted by JosslynGrijalva.
