You and I moving in the dark 
 Bodies close but souls apart 
 Shadowed smiles and secrets unrevealed 
 I need to know the way you feel 

 I'll give you everything I am 
 And everything I want to be 
 I'll put it in your hands 
 If you could open up to me oh 
 Can't we ever get beyond this wall 
 'Cause all I want is just once 
 To see you in the light 
 But you hide behind 
 The color of the night 

 I can't go on running from the past 
 Love has torn away this mask 
 And now like clouds like rain I'm drowning and 
 I blame it all on you 
 I'm lost - God save me... 

 I'll give you everything I am 
 And everything I want to be 
 I'll put it in your hands 
 If you could open up to me oh 
 Can't we ever get beyond this wall 
 'Cause all I want is just once 
 To see you in the light 
 But you hide behind 
 The color of the night 

 God save me... 

 ...everything I am 
 And everything I want to be 
 Can't we ever get beyond this wall 
 'Cause all I want is just once 
 Forever and again 
 I'm waiting for you, I'm standing in the light 
 But you hide behind 
 The color of the night 

 Please come out from 
 The color of the night---Lyrics submitted by Svetlana.
