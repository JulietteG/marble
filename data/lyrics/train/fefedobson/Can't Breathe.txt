It's been 37 days since you turned and walked away.
Baby, you were foolish. You were wrong.
You should have made it better.
You broke the promise you made 'cause you were jealous and afraid.
Baby, I was rising, you let me down. We should've stood together.

(CHORUS)
Now I can't breathe (if I'm not breathing with you)
I can't sleep (if all I'm dreaming is you)
Can't you see? (I've got no air without you)
I can't breathe, I can't breathe

(So I, So I, So I) So I cracked and called you today, and the tears froze on my face.
'Cause you said we were over, you were so cold.
We should've been forever.

(CHORUS)
Now I can't breathe (if I'm not breathing with you)
I can't sleep (if all I'm dreaming is you)
Can't you see? (I've got no air without you)
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
[ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/cant-breath-lyrics-fefe-dobson.html ]

We could have everything, but all we got is heartache and pain.
I can't catch my breath. It's getting harder to speak.
You should be proud of me, but you're too insecure and too vain.
We should've been forever. I wanted you forever.

(CHORUS)
Now I can't breathe (if I'm not breathing with you)
I can't sleep (if all I'm dreaming is you)
Can't you see? (I've got no air without you)
I can't breathe, I can't breathe

(GUITAR SOLO)

Why couldn't you just be a man?
Why couldn't you just understand?
All I want to do is hold your hand.
Why couldn't we walk hand-in-hand?
Why couldn't you just be a man?
Why couldn't you just understand?
All I want to do is hold your hand.---Lyrics submitted by Kari.
