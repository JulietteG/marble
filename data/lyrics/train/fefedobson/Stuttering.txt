Theres a whole lot of things that i will forgive but i just cant take a liar
i was by his side till the very end till you pushed me in the fire
i tried to believe you but something is wrong

you wont look in my eyes tell me whats goin on
its you and me against the world thats what you said thats what you said
if you cant be honest with me then im afraid this is the end

(chorus
hurry up hurry up if you ever forget about me
tell the truth give it up your still guilty
cuz your stutterin 

oh-o-o-oh-oh-e-e-eh-eh-ehh-o-o-o-oh-ohh
yeah your stutterin (x 4)

seconds turn into minutes now 
but you wont give me an answer
you can tell me this you can tell me that but dont say you dont remember
cuz i know you better then you know yourself
so dont say im crazy i know very well
its you and me against the world thats what you said thats what you said
if you cant be honest with me then im afraid this is the end

(chorus)
hurry up hurry up if you ever forget about me
tell the truth give it up your still guilty
cuz your stutterin 

oh-o-o-oh-oh-e-e-eh-eh-ehh-o-o-o-oh-ohh
yeah your stutterin (x 4)

I-i-i-do-dont-wanna here you so-orry-now the-e-e best thing you can do for me is just spit it out
I-i-i-do-dont-wanna here you so-orry-now sto-stop stutterin your words
its only making you look worse

(chorus)
hurry up hurry up if you ever forget about me
tell the truth give it up your still guilty
cuz your stutterin 

oh-o-o-oh-oh-e-e-eh-eh-ehh-o-o-o-oh-ohh
yeah your stutterin (x 4)---Lyrics submitted by hugo.
