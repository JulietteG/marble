From the fire in your words
to the dagger in your eye
I just have to
lay my body down
go and
lay my body down
I pretend to be asleep
but I knwo you hear my cry
I just have to
lay my body down
go and
lay my body down

but if I
really want a change
then I must admit
that I'm the one to blame

chorus:
if I could break away
cut the cord
for worse or better
if I could turn the page
at last and say
goodbye forever
but on the other side
of yesterday
beyond the heartache
what if all I am
without the pain
is empty hearted
I could break away

is it true what people say
that it's darkest before dawn?
I just have to
lay my body down
go and 
lay my body down
any hope we might have saved
is too weak to let live on
i just have to 
lay my body down
go and
lay my body down

and if I
really want a change
then tonight I'm gonna need
all of my strength

chorus

oh, anything is better than this
I know
anything is better

chorus

if I could break away

if I could turn the page

but on the other side
of yesterday
beyond the heartache
what if all I am
without the pain
is empty hearted
i could break away---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
