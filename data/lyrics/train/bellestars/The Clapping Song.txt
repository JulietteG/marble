Three-six-nine the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the street car line
The line broke the monkey got choked and they all went to heaven in a little row boat
Clap pat, clap pat, clap pat, clap slap
Clap pat, clap your hand, pat it on your partner's hand, right hand
Clap pat, clap your hand, cross it with your left arm
Pat your partner's left palm
Clap pat, clap your hand, pat your partner's right palm with your right palm again
Clap slap, clap your hand
Slap your thighs and sing a little song, go
My mama told me if I was goody that she would buy me a rubber dolly
My aunty told her I kissed a soldier
Now she won't buy me a rubber dolly
Three-six-nine the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the street car line
The line broke the monkey got choked and they all went to heaven in a little row boat
Clap, clap, clap your hands and prepare to pat
Clap, take your right arm, pat your partner's right palm with your right palm
Clap, take your hand back and clap and clap and clap and clap
Clap, take your right arm, cross your right arm with your left arm
Pat your partner's left palm with your left palm
Clap, now back with a clap

Slap, take the pats of your palms and slap your thighs and watch the fun materialize as you sing this little song
My mama told me if I was goody that she would buy me a rubber dolly
My aunty told her I kissed a soldier
Now she won't buy me a rubber dolly
Three-six-nine the goose drank wine
The monkey chewed tobacco on the street car line
The line broke the monkey got choked and they all went to heaven in a little row boat
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, slap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, slap
My mama told me (Told me) if I was goody (Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, slap) (If I was good)
That she would buy me a rubber dolly (Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, slap) (A rubber dolly)
My aunty told her I kissed a soldier (Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, slap)
Now she won't buy me a rubber dolly (Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, slap)
My mama told me (Clap, clap, clap, clap)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
