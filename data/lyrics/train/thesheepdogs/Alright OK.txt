Tears run down my face
the shame I can't erase
damn those bastards all
you can't persuade them all

I miss you, some time I meet you
if only to just complete you
ever you can't call
it helps to please them all

I say now, alright, I'm OK
I got time
it helps me clear my mind

I say now, alright, I'm OK
I got time
It helps me clear my mind

Memories they faded
dreams of yesterday
I hate to see it's o'er
but forward we must go

Gettin' tired of the new one
steppin' out for this cool one
a viscious game to play
but it had to be this way

I say now, alright, I'm OK
I got time
it helps me clear my mind

I say now, alright, I'm OK
I got time
it helps me clear my mind

Yeah...
feels like dreams of yesterday
feels like dreams of yesterday
feels like dreams of yesterday

I say now, alright, I'm OK
I got time
it helps me clear my mind

I say now, alright, I'm OK
I got time
it helps me clear my mind

Yeah...
yesterday
yeah, yesterday
feels like dreams of yesterday
feels like dreams of yesterday---Lyrics submitted by Troy Roberts.
