Everythings the way it is
Its got to be the way it is
Everythings the way it is

Its got to be the way it is
Everythings the way it is
Its got to be the way you say it is
I need a heartache, but it wont be long
Till I get to where its coming on
A little fame and I know its true
You can feel it and its coming for you
No matter how hard Ive tried to stay
I feel you ulling me further away

Eh, eh, eh
Uh, uh, uh
Eh, eh, eh
Uh, uh, uh

Everythings the way it is
Its got to be the way it is
Everythings the way it is
Its got to be the way it is
Feel like its a trivial game
You get in order but you Stay the same
You look good when you shaking my way
But let me think of something awful to say
Ye-e-e-ah, uh-uh-uh
Ye-e-e-ah, uh-uh-uh

Everythings the way it is
Its got to be the way it is
Everythings the way it is
Its got to be the way it is

I step back take a total view
I take some little, baby its hard to do
But Ill call, Ill try to change
Its better than to stay the same

Eh, eh, eh
Uh, uh, uh
Eh, eh, eh
Uh, uh, uh
Eh, eh, eh
Uh, uh, uh
Eh, eh, eh
Uh, uh, uh

Everythings the way it is
Its got to be the way it is
Everythings the way it is
Its got to be the way it is---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
