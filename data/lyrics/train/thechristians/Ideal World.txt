Before you point the finger 
and hope the whole thing disappears
remember empty words will fall, will fall upon the deafest ears
You wont give in without a fight, foul play without a doubt
no silver lining to be seen, in this thundercloud 
Oh thats not allowed..
In the Ideal World  we'd be free to choose
But In my real World you can bet were gonna lose
oooh  ooh ooh 
Your money fills their pockets, fear fills their tiny minds
at last the world is talking now, this aint no way to treat mankind
a sudden blackout stops the show but doesnt stop the way I am 
for all my life Ive been oppressed your not the first to say I am 
I do all I can for an Ideal World where were free to choose 
But in my real world you can bet were gonna lose...
In the Ideal World we can start again 
but in my real world depends on the colour of your skin...
We could be free forever if they would only change, but fools never change
..A speck of blue up in the sky, a song of hope a noble thought 
but how long must the people die before the guilty ones are caught
Oh will you spare a thought for an Ideal World 
where were free to choose for in my Ideal World
Oh were no longer born to lose In the Ideal world we can start again 
In the Ideal World, lets put an end to suffering ..... 
end suffering In the Ideal World (Were now free to choose,) 
In my Ideal World now we are set to  air our views
In the Ideal World we can start again now in my real world 
it matters not about the colour of your skin ooh oooh 
Oh were no longer bear the news... (Ideal World...start again) like to start again ...---Lyrics submitted by David.
