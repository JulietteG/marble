Nyce 2 know ya [x3]

I live inside your head just like the day before tomorrow.
And spending most our lives with calling things we already know.
I tried so hard to skill the sky and call it heaven bound.
At times I feel like I'm alone like a new kid in town
She said I need your love that's what she said
She said she had to break the mirrors that exist in her head
I often wonder if I could keep you gone from minds and 
But then I feel the heat and wind beneath these angel wings

Nice to know ya
Can't believe it's almost over now and you just wanna let me go
Nice to know ya
And when I look up at your picture I see somebody I seen before
Nice to know ya
Cause every time you talk about it how come I'm always the last to know
Nice to know ya
Even though you don't deserve me cause you would rather close the door
Nice to know ya

I'd rather run then work this out
You left the sun cause you burned it out
Ain't no time to waste
I already had my taste I gotta find another way
You and I go in and forever out of place because I'm leaving you today
Ooh never change always be the same driving slow on purpose up in my fast lane
Then again I think you reason with the heaven perception is reality perceived that I be leaving
I know the reason you need something to believe in,
God she's the type to kick a sleeping dog
Raw when I eat the beef like a freak I'ma [?] turning the other cheek

I don't wanna be the one to tell you it's over
I'm wise enough to see the sun I'm finally sober
I'm moving on you can't prove me wrong girl
There's nothing left to say cause I'm goooooone

Nice to know ya
Can't believe it's almost over now when you just wanna let me go
Nice to know ya
And when I look up at your picture I see someone I seen before
Nice to know ya
Cause everytime we talk about it how come I'm always the last to know
Nice to know ya
You know you don't even deserve because you would rather close the door
Nice to know ya.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
