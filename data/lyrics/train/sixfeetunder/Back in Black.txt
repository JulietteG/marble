Back in black,
I hit the sack,
It's been too long I'm glad to be back,
Yes, I'm let loose,
From the noose,
That's kept me hanging around.
I'm just looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives
Cat's Eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild

CHORUS:
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
oooh... I'm back now,
Yes, I'm back
well, I'm back.... back
back in black
(Well) I'm back in black!

Back in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes I'm in a bang
With a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
Cause I'm down on the track
And I'm beatin' the pack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my pay
Dont try to push your luck just get out of my way

CHORUS

'Cos, I'm back, 
Yes I'm back.
oooh, I'm back now,
yes, I'm back!
oooh, I'm back....back...now
Back in black,
Well, I'm back in black.....
Angus solo..........

Oooh.... yeah
Ohh yeah
Yes I am
Oooh yeah, yeah Oh yeah
Back in now
Well I'm back, I'm back
Back, I'm back
Back, I'm back
Back, I'm back
Back, I'm back
Back
Back in black
Yes I'm back in black---Lyrics submitted by bug.
