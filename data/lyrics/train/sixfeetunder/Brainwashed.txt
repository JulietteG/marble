You will die - no love there for you
There's no guiding light
to lead you through the night
Only screams of torment, only fear and emptiness
No life after the grave - only pain
Lies- lies to live and die by
Passed down through the years
The truth? They'll never let you hear
Only screams of torment, only fear and emptiness
No life after the grave - only pain
Pain - pain
The disease of life continues
Only the blind will follow
And rot in the dirt
Afraid to live - dead before you died
Brainwashed - you live blind
Brainwashed - they rot alive
Brainwashed - preach your lies
Brainwashed - I watch you die
You will die - no love there for you
There's no guiding light
to lead you through the night
Only screams of torment, only fear and emptiness
No life after the grave - only pain
Only screams of torment, only fear and emptiness
You're the one who is lost - brainwashed---Lyrics submitted by Akos.
