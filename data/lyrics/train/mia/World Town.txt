Hands up
Guns out
Represent the world town

Sick of all the shit that's keeping me down
Dead from the waist down
It's easy staying down
I never thought about it twice
But you do pay the price
It aint your weekly cash that feeds my mum the rice

Yo don't be calling me desperate
When I'm knocking on the door
Every wall you build I'll knock it down to the floor
See me see me bubbling quietly
See me see me acting like you ain't met me
See me see me bubbling quietly
See me see me acting like you ain't met me

Hands up
Guns out
Represent the world town

Look at what you did, you done it before
Every little dollar just keeps me down more
I never had you on my side bubbling on my side
Why they tell me different
When they make me explodified

Yo dont be calling me desperate
When i'm knocking on the door
Every wall you build i'll knock it down to the floor
See me see me bubbling quietly
See me see me acting like you ain't met me
See me see me bubbling quietly
See me see me acting like you ain't met me

Hands up
Guns out
Represent the world town---Lyrics submitted by lucy.
