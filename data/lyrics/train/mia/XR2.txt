Where were you in 92?(x4)
92,92,90,90,92

This is how we do in the xr2
The boyz look fine, stereo's alpine
20/20 , thunderbird at 12 0 9
Took a pill good time all the time[x2]

Brick lane massive
We were like grime
Labrynth, world dance
Bagleys time
High top fades
We aint never paid
Roll up jeans e 's lucozade
Versaci jeans shades and chains
We roll in there like we late
Dj mcs private raves
Keep it secret , light it mate.

Whistle, whistle
Blow, blow

Here we, here we
Go, go

Some of them drink heineken
And some of them drink bacardi
Some of them talk a lot of shit
And act rowdy
Some say people follow me
Some say people is the key
When the music's got a beat
Then that's what gets me

Some people think we r stupid but we r not

Xr2 808
