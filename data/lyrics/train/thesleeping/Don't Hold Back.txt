yeah open
now let me see the way you work it
let me see you work it

just lay down...

you've got me right here where i need it
i'll hold out just as long as you
don't worry, don't worry, we are
we're weak in the knees and i can't take this
heat stroke, our burning bodies melt away
just work it, just work it, i've been
i've been waiting, i've been waiting
i've been craving away, i need this
i will hold out just as long as you
(tonight is the night we sink wishes deep into our skin)

Don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me
don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me
oh yeah!!

are you nervous?
spending your days away in space
thicker than air, than air
we've been waiting, we've been waiting
we've been craving away, we need this
i'll hold out just as long as you
(tonight is the night we examine ourselves tip to top)

don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me
don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me

stop.

work, work, just let this work
just let it take control, fusing you to me
oh, just let it take control, fusing you to me
just let it take control, fusing you to me
just let it take control, fusing you to me

don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me
don't hold back, hold nothing back tonight
oh, we'll let it take control, fusing you to me

yeah open
now let me see the way you work it
come on and take control right now, now, now, now.---Lyrics submitted by Not.
