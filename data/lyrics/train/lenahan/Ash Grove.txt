Down yonder green valley where streamlets meander
When twilight is fading I pensively rove
Or at the bright noontide in solitude wander
Amid the dark shades of the lonely ash grove

Twas there while the blackbird was cheerfully singing
I first met that dear one, the joy of my heart
Around us for gladness the bluebells were springing
Ah! Then little thought I how soon we should part

Still glows the bright sunshine oer the valley and mountain
Still warbles the blackbird its note from the tree
Still trembles the moonbeam on streamlet and fountain,
But what are the beauties of nature to me

With sorrow, deep sorrow, my heart it is laden
All day I go mourning in search of my love
Ye echoes oh tell me, where is the sweet maiden?
She sleeps neath the green turf down by the Ash Grove---Lyrics submitted by David.
