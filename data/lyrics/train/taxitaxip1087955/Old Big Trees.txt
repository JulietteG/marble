Bachelor oh bachelor
I can set you free
This ground could turn from stone to a humble bird nest
Our souls could grow wings from our back
See what I've got in my hand
Can't you hear I'm singing that
I love you?

Ohh your hand could be my hand
In which we had a heart
In which we were hiding from the old big trees around us
That are trying to offer the branches to us
We protest, insist screaming
We grow our own leaves

Maybe my skeleton would be quite beautiful beside yours
And when we're eventually free from this weight there is now
We would still be pretty 
Deep in the soil
And we would still be singing
Everywhere we go

Bachelor, oh bachelor
I can set you free
This ground could turn from stone to a humble bird nest
Our souls could grow wings from our back
See what I've got in my hand
Can't you hear I'm singing that
I love you?

I love you
I love you---Lyrics submitted by Sophia Soray.
