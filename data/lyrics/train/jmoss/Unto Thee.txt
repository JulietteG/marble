Unto thee, Oh Lord 
I dedicate my service 
Unto thee, Oh Lord 
In truth I give my worship 
Behold the King of glory 
Strong and mighty 
I love to be 
In the presence of His majesty 

I lift my hands 
And I'll lift my voice unto the Lord 
I give my life 
I give my soul for my reward 
I submit my all unto thee 

Unto thee, Oh Lord 
I dedicate my service 
Unto thee, Oh Lord 
In truth I give my worship 
Behold the King of glory 
Strong and mighty 
I love to be 
In the presence of His majesty 

I lift my hands 
And I'll lift my voice unto the Lord 
I give my life 
I give my soul for my reward 
I submit my all unto thee 

[BRIDGE:]
I live to praise and please You 
O, God of all the heavens and earth 
The Father who's so high and holy 
Depp in my temple, rests 
A heart that won't be persuaded not to serve You 

I lift my hands 
And I'll lift my voice unto the Lord 
I give my life 
I give my soul for my reward 

I lift my hands 
And I'll lift my voice 

I submit all unto thee---Lyrics submitted by Ashli.
