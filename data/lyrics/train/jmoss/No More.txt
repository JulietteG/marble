(intro)

i ain't never gonna let no stick
i ain't never gonna let no stone
they ain't never gonna break my bones
no, no, no, no
i ain't never gonna hurt my future
by hanging with a bunch of losers
i'm never gonna choose to die
no, no, no, no

(break it)
no weapon formed against me shall prosper, uh uh (break it)
never gonna fall a victim to your debacle, uh uh
i'm part of a posterity
with a bloodline of royalty
what i am is a child of The King
and what that means is I am free

Chorus:
no more tangled, (no more) twisted  (no more) livin'
no more tainted, (no more) crooked (no more) livin'
no more hurtful, (no more) fearful (no more) livin'
no more painful, (no more) shameful (no more) livin'

(no more)

i ain't never gonna stop from dreamin'
never stop my faith from streamin'
there ain't nothin' that my Dad can't do
no, no, no, no
ain't nothin' gonna pull me down
even if it's in my background
i am never gonna choose to lose
no, no, no, no

for we walk by faith and not by sight
i will not be blinded by the temptations of the night
i'm part of a posterity
with a bloodline of royalty
what i am is a child of The King
and what that means is I am free

no more tangled, (no more) twisted  (no more) livin'
no more tainted, (no more) crooked (no more) livin'
no more hurtful, (no more) fearful (no more) livin'
no more painful, (no more) shameful (no more) livin'

Bridge: ***
if God be for us who shall against us? 
my riding star, sword and shield 
man, all these things... we are more than conquerors 
so i struggle in these words no more

(no more) uh, uh
and the struggle?
no more... uh, uh... no more

(no more) uh, uh
and the pain?
no more... uh, uh... no more

(no more) uh uh
the stress?
no more... uh, uh... no more

(no more) uh, uh
the headache?
no more... uh, uh... be free!

no more tangled, (no more) twisted  (no more) livin'
no more tainted, (no more) crooked (no more) livin'
no more hurtful, (no more) fearful (no more) livin'
no more painful, (no more) shameful (no more) livin'
(repeat 2x)

it's over... it's over...
