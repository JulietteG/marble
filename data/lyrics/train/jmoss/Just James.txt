I'm not one to make excuses
I'm not one to place the blame on others
I'm not one to take the easy way out
I'm just a man trying to do the best I can
The greatest commandment is to love one another
and even more love the Lord even better
but when its all said and done
and when a rainy day comes
Take my hand and understand I'm human

CHORUS
I keep thinkin' bout where I went wrong
its keeping me awake at night all alone
but I realize underneath all of us are really just the same
I'm just James
I'm just James

Live another day to tell somebody
If you're in trouble we can pray about it
and I don't really need to know what happened
but since I love you, I can feel your sadness
I'm a witness God can set you free
Cuz I remember what He did for me
when its all said and done
and your rainy day comes
I'll take your hand and understand that your human

I keep thinkin' bout where I went wrong
its keeping me awake at night all alone
but I realize underneath all of us are really just the same
I'm just James

I keep thinkin' bout what went wrong (where I went wrong)
its keeping me awake at night all alone
but I realize underneath all of us are really just the same
(I'm just James), I'm James, (I'm just James)

You see I'm not perfect (James)
but I keep on working (James)
I'm full of blemish (James)
Never said I'm flawless (James)
See I wanna be used (James)
but I get confused (James)
Able to be tempted (James)
But what I did was I called on Jesus
You see me plus Him (Jesus)
Makes me walk different (Jesus)
Makes me talk different (Jesus)
Even sing different (Jesus)
But I'm a work in progress (Jesus)
And I know He's not finished (Jesus)
He's working on me (Jesus)
He's working on meeeeeeee (Jesus) Uh oh

I keep thinkin' bout where I went wrong
its keeping me awake at night all alone
but I realize underneath all of us are really just the same
I'm just James 

He's working (He's working on me)
from the inside out (He's working on me)
He scrubbed me down (He's working on me)
Turned it around (not through with me yet)
He's working (He's working on me) on my anointing (He's working on me) 
on my commitment (He's working on me) 
on my commitment (and not through with me yet)
He's fixing me (He's working on me)
He's fixing me (He's working on me)
He's changing me(He's working on me)
Yeah Yeah Yeah (and not through with me yet)
He's working (He's working on me)
Breakking me open (He's working on me)
cleaning me out (He's working on me)
and I thank Him (and not through with me yet)
I'm just James

TALKING
Before I was afflicted, I strayed away.  
But now, I'm keeping your word
Just James---Lyrics submitted by Cynthia.
