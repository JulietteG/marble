[INTRO:]
Oh no, I thought it'd never come 
That day that I tell that I gotta run 
Run, run back to my Savior 
To my labor, cause His word is razor sharp 
I forgot I had it in my heart 
I gotta do a clean sweep from the start 
I drop everything that ain't clean 
Don't take it for being mean 
A brother's gotta fufill his dreams 
You feelin me?

[VERSE:]
You made my toes, bring my balance to the floor 
You made my feet, walk right over to your door 
You had my ankles, tangled, and puzzled 
You had my knees to the point they'd buckle 
the light of day hadn't stumbled over your way 
Didn't wait for the night time, the high time, the right time 
Bein as it was, we had to close the door 
It's like turnin away from a million bucks 
But I can't see you no more

[CHORUS:]
It's like the cold of a lonly night 
The draft of a window not shut tight 
I've got a hunger for bein right 
That's what I'm livin for, I'm livin for 
Inticed by the things you do 
It's a one way ticket to devil's hell foolin wit you 
My soul wants to be true 
That's what I'm livin for, I'm livin for

[VERSE:]
You had my legs on the verge of Virtual restrainer 
I could not move without permission from my trainer 
You had my arms and hands Wrapped around your lust 
You made my heart buzz 
the light of day hadn't stumbled over your way 
Didn't wait for the night time, the high time, the right time 
Bein as it was, we had to close the door 
It's like turnin away from a million bucks 
But I can't see you no more

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
I'd give my life 
Not under tempation, nor condemnation 
For my slavation is more important to me
