Forgive me, Oh Lord
It's me again
Forgive me, Oh lord
It's me again
I've disobeyed Your word
I've slipped out of Your will
Regretful I stand
Me again

Forgive me, Oh Lord
It's me again
Forgive me, Oh lord
It's me again
I've disobeyed Your word
I've slipped out of Your will
Regretful I stand
Me again

Forgive me, Oh Lord
It's me again
Forgive me, Oh lord
It's me again
I've disobeyed Your word
I've slipped out of Your will
Regretful I stand
Me again

Send Your mercy
Down from glory
Lord, please purge me
Renew me, fix me
Again, again

Send Your mercy
Down from glory
Lord, please purge me
Renew me, fix me
Again, again

Send Your mercy
Down from glory
Lord, please purge me
Renew me, fix me
Send Your mercy
Down from glory
Lord, please purge me
Renew me, fix me
Again, again

Again, again

Me again---Lyrics submitted by qui.
