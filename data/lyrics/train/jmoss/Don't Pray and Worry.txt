[J moss laughing] Whew, come on let's keep it going

He knows all that's before you
He will never neglect His child
Nor will ignore tears in your eyes
Lay your cares to rest

[Chorus:]
The righteous won't be forsaken
Just hold to your faith
And His word will be manifested
Be steadfast and don't fear
Don't pray and worry

Why is it that we will spend time
going to church but don't understand why
Why we must pray
And then belive
Things we pray for will soon be recived

The prayers of the righteous availeth much
Be not weary in well doing
God of Heaven can do anything
Lay your cares to rest
For the righteous

[Chorus]

He who holds the future
Also rules this land
And responsible for each breath we take
Just pray and then leave it there
Pray and then leave it there

Maybe you've lost all hope
And can't see past tomorrow
Speak His word into your life
And stand on His promise to you

[Chorus x2]---Lyrics submitted by joe jolex.
