Showing my love will be faithful, proving my heart won't change
Giving you more than the day before, for no day will be the same
Giving you time of substance, maintaining the place that you dwell in
Deeper than the ocean floor, I never want us to end

I wanna give you more, I wanna share my life with you
More than money can pay for, Allow me to give you more
I have so much to say, the day that I see you face to face
More than an army can fight for, Allow me to give you more........nadadanadadda

Paying attention to detail, Letting no praise go unspoken
Joy streamming from heart to heart, That they may never be broken
Giving my mind, body and soul, To show you how much I am grateful
To have and hold you close to me, That I may never be alone

I wanna give you more, I wanna share my life with you
More than money can pay for, Allow me to give you more
I have so much to say, The day that I see you face to face
More than an army can fight for, Allow me to give you more

Like a tree is to a leaf, You are what I need to breathe
Words can't explain the affection that I have for you
I wanna be what brings to you a smile on your face,
Because you feel it more from my heart, more from my soul 
Each Day! Each Day! Let me give you more.....

CHORUS:
I wanna give you more, I wanna share my life with you more than money can pay for
I wanna give you more, I have so much to say.....................---Lyrics submitted by samke.
