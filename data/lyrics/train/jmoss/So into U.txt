TALKING
I found a new place
That place is in you
Drop

Its Amazing
That I've never been into you this much
Kinda feels like hey now
I can't find the words but it just feels like
hey now (hey now)
It feels like hey now (hey now)
If you know what I'm talking about 
say hey now (hey now)
Listen

I'm so into you, Its my love song
I'm so into you
You're the God of grace, the God of hope
and I'm so into you

Father,  I'm so into you (ooohhh)
I'm so into you (been so good)
God of grace, God of hope
and I'm so into you

If you love Him can you help me?
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you (Its real simple)
God of grace, God of hope (God of hope)
I'm in love (I'm in love with you)

And when He does something spectacular 
we're just in awe
I'm in awe of you, Oh God
I'm in awe of you,
The way you changed my life Jesus (God of grace)
and you gave me hope (God of hope)
I'm in awe (I'm in awe of you)

There'll be no God
(There's no God above you)
Nor before you (Nor before you)
Ruler (Ruler of Nations)
Father of Nations (Father of Patience)
Your word (Your word through Christ is living inside)

I'm so into you (4x)

And I just can't get enough, I need more

I need more of you
more of your spirit Jesus (I need more of you)
Won't you let me spend a little more time with you (God of Grace)
to teach me (God of Hope) 
and to build my faith up (I need more of you)

Please give me more (I need more of you)
More of your anointing Jesus (I need more of you)
More power to withstand temptation (God of Grace)
I wanna do better (God of Hope)
Wanna be in order (I need more of you)

There's no God above you (There's no God above you)
Nor before you (Nor before you)
Ruler (Ruler of Nations)
Father (Father of Patience)
We can't live without your words (Your word through Christ is living inside)

I'm so into you (repeating)
I wanna be more like ya
I wanna walk more like ya
I wanna be pleasing
I wanna be pleasing
I'm not nothing without ya
I'm not nothing without ya
It was your favor
took away the haters
It was your mercy
that forgave me
Nothing else matters
No one else matters
You control my every move so I 
dedicate my life to you
No one better
No one's better
Greater is He 
that is in me
than he
that is in the world
I'm all in
I'm so into you

You need to get into Him
For His grace is sufficient
and his strength is made perfect in weakness
So shout through the storm 
and may his power rest upon you

I'm into that (2x)

I'm into you---Lyrics submitted by Cynthia.
