All this time we've together 
Everyday a new adventure 
Times enough to last forever and a day 
Our love was sometimes all we have, 
Through good times and through bad, 
I loved you all the way

All our days would bright and sunny, 
There were times we had no money, 
You could always find some funny thing to say, 
And looking back on where we've been 
I'll do it all again 
I loved you all the way

Chorus:
I loved you all the way...
Hey.. every might, 
Every night 
Everyday

Times id thought i couldn't take it 
Wondering if we'd ever make it, 
You could hold me close and make it go away, 
And though i've said it all before
I never meant it more, 
I loved you all the way.... (2x)---Lyrics submitted by Henry.
