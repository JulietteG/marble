If I fall in the ocean, would it take me home?
If I fall in the ocean, would it take me home?
If I fall on the stars, would I get lost?
If I fall on the stars, would I get lost?

Look to the side and I'll be near.
Look to the side, I'll be near.

If I climb the mountain, would I get there?
If I climb the mountain, would I get there?

Look to the side, I'll be near.
Look to the side, I'll be near.

If I fall in the ocean, would I get home?
If I fall in the ocean, would I get home?

Look to the side, I'll be near.
Look to the side, I'll be near.

Look to the side....Look to the side....---Lyrics submitted by Andrey Bugatti.
