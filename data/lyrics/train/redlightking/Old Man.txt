He did'nt have much,
A pair of hard working hands,
Everything that I needed,
 I got it from the old man,
With a 9 second dream,
He drove the redlight bandit,
And the grease on his hands,
Was the way he comanded,
And the life he demanded, 
That kept us all in a struggle,
When he ruled with his fist,
He kept us all outta trouble,
Even though he would leave,
He wore his heart on his sleeve,
By the way that he walked,
He taught me how to beleive,

Old man look at my life,
Take a look take a look,
Old man Old look at my life, 
Cause i'm alot like you,
Old man Old man take a look at my life,
Take a look take a look,
Old man Old man take a look at my life,
Cause i'm alot like you,

Growing up at the track,
He had a reason for being fast,
His heart felt like braking,
He looked right up at the ceiling and,
Start again and never breath a word of his loss,
Cause it's not about winning,
It's the rivers you cross,
And the pain that you feel,
Can be the fuel that you use,
And if you need the direction, 
Be it the path that you choose,
My old man is a legend,
He cast a shadow so great,
I think of how he is wise,
With every move that I make,

Old man look at my life,
Take a look take a look,
Old man look at my life, 
Cause i'm alot like you,
Old man Old man take a look at my life,
Take a look take a look,
Old man Old man take a look at my life,
Cause i'm alot like you,

If there's no slowing down,
There's only second the pace,
No more dreams to be stolen,
Just the right ones to chase,
We've been through the worst,
Now you know who to trust,
Leaving something for high, 
Before the ashes and dust,

Old man look at my life life life life life,
Old man look at my life life life life life,
Old man Old man take a look at my life,
Cause i'm alot like you,
Old man Old man take a look at my life,
Cause i'm alot like you,
Old man Old man take a look at my life,
Cause i'm alot like you,
Old man look at my life,
Take a look take a look,
Old man look at my life,
Cause i'm alot like you,
Old man look at my life,
Take a look take a look,
Old man look at my life,
Cause i'm alot like you,---Lyrics submitted by Tracy Flynn.
