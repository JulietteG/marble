i wonder, if he knows iv been watching him
and i wonder, if he knows i can feel him
and i wonder, in my dreams when im sleeping
and im keeping him close to me
im thinking, he the thunder, im the lightning 
and im thinking, maybe we could come togher
and im thinking, we could bring the rain with 
a lovely breeze and such harmony
CHORSE
like a train on a track like spokes inside a wheel 
involuntarty motion, like rolling down hill
and theres no way to stop it
its a natural thing like sunrise and dusk
snow flakes, waterfalls same thing like us
and theres no way to stop it
once you fall in love

im glowin, an overflow of happy lagher
and im growing, closer to you more than ever
im blowing, dafodils and kisses, baby breath and roses
gently touchin noses
im sailing without a destination
im sailing explore uncharted places 
im exhaling, no more lonley seasons im breathing 
drowning in the sea of love

COURSE

i heard a bird, a seed came through the earth
strangers holding hands, a crowd cheering in stands
iv already seen all the evidence
it's obvious love's in the air again
saw dark clouds blow, chased by rainbows 
saw two roses bloom just like me and you
caught up in the magic i cant pretend
it's obvious love's in the air again

there's no way to stop it, no way
boy you and i
are l..u..v in love you see
that you and i are l..u..v in love
ther's no way to stop it, no way
boy you and i
are l..u..v in love you see
that you and i are l..u..v in love---Lyrics submitted by darnetta.
