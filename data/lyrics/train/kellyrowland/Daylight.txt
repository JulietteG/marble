[Intro: Travis McCoy]
Yeah,
You know what it is,
Its your man travis
Gym class heroes
Kelly Rowland
Oh so beautiful
Baby Girl,stay up all night
Now tell 'em ,show'em how we do
Here we go! Oh!

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
It's five o'clock am,
And the party is still going strong.
There is a conversation in the corner,
Tell a friend, bring everyone.
(C'mon let's go)
Cus the FM music is groovin'
Folks getting down, getting down in 
thier shocking feet.
Sleepy eyes are peeping,
(They're watching baby)
From the window across the street

[Chorus:]
And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again.
(damn right and im lovin every minute)
Most people like getting up when im just getting in.
(I'll be back in three days like Paris's jail sentence)
And oh, its the only only time,
Its the only time when i can unwind

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
I swore to myself time and time again,
That I would give up the night life,
(yeah right)
Start laying in.
But it ain't easy, no, no,
(no, no, no)
Saying no to my friends.
(That's right)
Cus the real, cus the real set don't get started,
Till everyone else is in

[Chorus:]
And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again.
(damn right and im lovin every minute)
Most people like getting up when im just getting in.
(I'll be back in three days like Paris's jail sentence)
And oh, its the only, only time,
Its the only time when I can unwind.

[Rap:]
Hello world, good morning sunshine
Great to see you again,
Homie, I'm doin fine
Chasin daydreams, you know still pursuing mine,
Sleep is so foreign,TV is so boring,
New York is New York,
Travie is aight,
The freaks come out at night like a vampire.
Nocturnal lurking
The daylight creeps up 

[Chorus:]
And it looks like daylight's gonna get me up again.
(Damn right and im loving every minute of it)
Most people like getting up when im just getting in.
(I'll be back in three days like Paris's jail sentence)
Daylight's gonna get me up again
(Damn right and im lovin every minute)
Most people like getting up when im just getting in.
