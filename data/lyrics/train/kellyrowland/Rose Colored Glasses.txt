Everybody's saying that we should get back together
And everybody's saying that we meant to be together
Everybody's saying how the love was so damn perfect
And I ain't never seen a bit of it, don't think it's worth it cuz
They ain't been through the things that you put me through and
They ain't seen all the things that I've seen in you
and they ain't never cried the tears you made me cry
So, they can't be the judge 'cos...

They don't know what I know
They never seen that part of you
They know the lies I know the truth
They say stay I say go
They never seen our scars before
They think our love is beautiful

'Cos everything is beautiful when you're looking through 
Rose colored glasses
Everything seems amazin' when you see the view
In rose colored glasses
Take 'em off 

Now everybody's thinking I was just too scared to love you
You got em all believin' that I folded under pressure
It's crazy how I gave my best I tried so hard to love you
I can't believe that all this time my pain just bought you pleasure
But they ain't been through the things that you put me through
And they ain't seen all the things that I seen in you
And they ain't never cried the tears you made me cry
So, they can't be the judge 'cos...

They don't know what I know
They never seen that part of you
They know the lies I know the truth
They say stay I say go
They never seen our scars before
They think our love is beautiful

'Cos everything is beautiful when you're looking through 
Rose colored glasses
Everything seems amazin' when you see the view
In rose colored glasses
Take 'em off 

Hey (take 'em off)
No (take 'em off)
Yeah
Take 'em off, take 'em off

Take 'em off 
Take 'em off off off
'Cosss...

They don't know what I know
They never seen that part of you
They know the lies I know the truth
They say stay I say go
They never seen our scars before
They think our love is beautiful

'Cos everything is beautiful when you're looking through 
Rose colored glasses
Everything seems amazin' when you see the view
In rose colored glasses
Take 'em off---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
