Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me

Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, Lay it on me, now, now
Lay it on me

What time do you get out? I wanna see you tonight
What time would you be? I wanna hold you tonight, yeah
I wanna just kiss you now, I wanna just touch you now
I wanna just give you all my love tonight

And tell 'em you'll be here in the morning, oh no
And tell you little friends that you're rolling solo
Tonight boy make my body go...oh
Lay it on me

Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me

Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, Lay it on me, now, now
Lay it on me

I don't mind I can wait up,
Cause i'mma enjoy the ride
And I know when you show up, imma be satisfied
So come, come lay me down
One more time around
Boy just get me all that love tonight

And tell 'em you'll be here in the morning, oh no
And tell you little friends that you're rolling solo
Tonight boy make my body go...oh
Lay it on me

Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me

Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, Lay it on me, now, now
Lay it on me

Lay it down, down, down, down
Lay it down, down, down, down
Lay it down, down, down, down...oh, oh

Lay it down, down, down, down
Lay it down, down, down, down
Lay it down, down, down, down...oh, lay it on me

The king of the californian king, you gotta call me sir
Watch me lay it down, and I ain't even tired
Put work in and I ain't even hired
Hidden high low, neighbors thought you joined the choir
You drop it, and ride with it, cuz she know that i'm liking it
Turn my lap into a show, for I spend all day just ridin' it
Tryin' clone that, uh!, just have a menage with it
Just a red light special, but I swear aint no stoppin this
She yellin' go Sean go, so shorty bring it back
Call my d*ck curiosity cause it killed the cat
And satisfaction brought it back
Girl it's your world, i'm just chillin' on the nap, saying


X2
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, baby
Lay it on me, oh
Lay it on me

Lay it on me, put it down on me, oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me, Lay it on me, now, now
