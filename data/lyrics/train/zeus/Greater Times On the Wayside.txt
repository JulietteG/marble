If you can hear me
Let me see you breathing
I'll tag along in the meantime
I'm asleep tonight for
Greater times on the wayside

When you're dreaming
Who do you see and how do you feel when you think of it?
Cause I've been thinking a lot about
Giving you all I've got in a standstill---Lyrics submitted by Eric Inostroza.
