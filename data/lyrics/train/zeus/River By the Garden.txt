Diamond mines are closed
And the forest knows it's old
I have walked through the river by the garden

Nothing there to see
Other than the trees
I have walked through the river by the garden
I have walked through the river by the garden

Doo doo doo doo doo-doo-doo
Doo doo-doo-doo
Doo doo-doo-doo doo doo-doo-doo
Doo doo-doo-doo

She was my best friend
Till she found another man
She don't know how badly she has hurt me

Well I could hurt her too (Waaaa-waaaa)
If I wanted to (Waaaa-waaaa-waaaa)
She don't know how badly I could hurt her

My heart keeps breaking every morning
My head keeps aching every night
My heart keeps breaking every morning
And my eyes are sick of crying

I led her down there
I could feel her fear
I left a mark in the river by the garden

When she turned her back
That's when I had my chance
Yeah I left a mark in the river by the garden
Yeah ehh-bleh-bleh by the river by the garden

My heart keeps breaking every morning
My head keeps aching every night
My heart keeps breaking every morning
And my eyes are sick of crying
Yeah my eyes are sick of crying---Lyrics submitted by Eric Inostroza.
