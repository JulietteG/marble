You told me I should get away
I tried but I got caught up again
You're the one who brought the renegade
But he's not gonna steal my mind away

Oh no I'm not telling you anything
Oh no I'm not giving them anything
Oh no I'm not losing anything
Oh no I'm not telling

Hooray for the ones who seized the day
I'm not gonna wait for them to say

Oh no I'm not telling you anything
Oh no I'm not giving them anything
Oh no I'm not losing anything
Oh no I'm not telling you anything

Oh no I'm (not telling you anything)
Oh no I'm (not giving them anything)
Oh no I'm (not losing anything)
Oh no I'm (not telling you)

You shut me up, I shut you out
I push and pull, you sit and pout (Aaaa-haaa-haaa-aaaa...)

Oh no I'm not telling you anything
Oh no I'm not giving them anything
Oh no I'm not losing anything
Oh no I'm not telling you anything

Oh no I'm not telling you anything
Oh no I'm not telling you anything
Oh no I'm not telling you anything
Oh no I'm not telling you

Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo 
Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo [fade out]---Lyrics submitted by Eric Inostroza.
