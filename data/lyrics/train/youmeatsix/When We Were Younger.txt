When I was younger I always thought
I could be someone if I tried enough
When I was younger my father said
wear a smile and show respect

When I was younger you never said
when I was older I'd feel helpless
When I was younger you shone the light
now that I'm older it doesn't shine bright

When I was younger you always said
That as I grow older it'd always be there

Im singing oooh x4

When I was younger I used to care
about everything that my father said
When I was younger you even told me
to show evil the utmost respect

When I was younger I never thought
that when I was older I'd see you give up
Now that I'm older I'll carry the torch
just promise you'll stand and you'll be strong

I'm singing oooh x8

When I was younger I never thought
When I was younger I never thought
When I was older I'd find you
When I was older I'd find you

I knew we'd find you x4

When I was younger I only dreamed
When I got older you'd be proud of me
When I was younger I promised you both
That when I was older you'd be proud of me---Lyrics submitted by Eden.
