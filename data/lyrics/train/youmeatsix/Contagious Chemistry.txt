If I could have a minute please, 
then I'll bring you to your knees.
This contagious chemistry is killing me.
Oh you'll never dissapear, 
until I give permission dear.
'Cause you're always gonna, always be knee deep.
So please.

Dearest enemy, off of that
You have just lost me along the way
Somewhere between the fake smiles and your free drinks
Please don't smother me, 
I swear that I need some room to breathe.
What with you all up, down and over me, 
you're not a name, you're just a face.
It's contagious, so catch it. 

This love is dirtier than you think.
Don't believe your eyes, believe your ears, trust me.
This won't sink lower than you think.
Don't believe your eyes, believe your ears, trust me.

Dearest enemy, you should listen to those dreams.
Because they tell you all you need to know 'bout who and what you are.
No smoke without a fire, with that - our names are a pure lie.
This suit of skin and bones, we've not all got...exactly what you are.
It's contagious, so catch it.

This love is dirtier than you think.
Don't believe your eyes, believe your ears, trust me.
This won't sink lower than you think.
Don't believe your eyes, believe your ears, trust me.

This is the first and the last time, I swear.
There's more where that came from, she said.
Do you know what that means? 'Cause I know what that means.
This is the first and the last time, I swear.
It's a numbers game and I was there.
Do you know what this means?
Do you know what this means?

No, oh!, who did you think I was, him?
No, oh!, is he the only lead you were working on?
No, oh!, and you were caught with the best yeah.
Oh forget the rest: hotel rooms, cheap thrill dress.
Lack of common sense can make this happen.

If I could have a minute please, 
then I'll bring you to your knees.
This contagious, contagious chemistry.

Dearest enemy, you should have never trusted me. You bitch.---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
