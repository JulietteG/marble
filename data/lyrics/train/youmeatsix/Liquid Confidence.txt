if one drink 
could make tonight 
slip my mind then i 
should drink up 
so i can forget 
that i haven't lived my life 
you are an example of 
better things to come 
so why wait on some other escape 
that leads me nowhere fast 
i've got to ask.. 

you've got nothing to lose 
except for me and you 
and i love that attitude 
when you know i can do.. 
i'll do better than you 

if one drink 
could make tonight 
slip your mind then you 
should drink up 
so you can convince 
yourself that i'm cute 
we are an example of.. 
why not to fall in love 
it takes a turn and then it hurts 
more than you could dream of 

well you've got nothing to lose 
except for me and you 
and i love that attitude 
when you know i can do.. 
i'll do better than you 

you've got nothing to prove 
oh no wait yes you do 
you wear it so well that we think it's true 

you can't stay, i want you gone 
for pulling the carpet i was standing on 
you can't stay, i want you gone 
for pulling the carpet i was standing on 
you can't stay, i want you gone 
for pulling the carpet i was standing on 
here's the exit, exit, exit 

you've got nothing to lose 
except for me and you 
and i love that attitude 
when you know i can do.. 
i'll do better than you 

we are an example of.. 
why not to fall in 
why not to fall in love 

we are an example of.. 
why not to fall in 
why not to fall in love
