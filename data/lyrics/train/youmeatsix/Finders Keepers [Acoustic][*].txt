You've got a nerve
Giving me the cold shoulder
Giving me the twice over, that's not deserved.
We'll talk, again when you're sober
You said I've got cold and our heat has gone

I wanna be your eyes
So you can't see, what you've done
I wanna be your ears
So you can't hear, everything that's been missing

Chorus
Finders keepers
Will you keep me in mind?
I like secrets
Cause they keep me in line
Old habits die hard
But I'm too young to die

I guess it's a mess
That you make your bed
So why are we still laying in it?
And I could barely sleep
I could barely eat
And it's been three whole weeks
Since I heard you speak

So you're sober today
Feeding months of bills to break
Oh I love mistakes
Especially ones you've made

(I bet you're sorry)

Chorus
Finders keepers
Will you keep me in mind
I like secrets
Cause they keep me in line
Old habits die hard
But I'm too young to die
No ..

Finders keepers
The whole thing is a lie
You won't find her
Cause she's too hard to find
So my advice and only run a mile

And have another drink
And then think this one over
You'll dig yourself a grave
Everyday, when you're sober
Do you see, what I mean?
At your best interest your all over me
I could never be what you need

Chorus:
Finders keepers
Will you keep me in mind?
I like secrets
Cause they keep me in line
Old habits die hard
But I'm too young to die

Finders keepers
The whole thing is a lie
You won't find her
Cause she's too hard to find
Take my advice and boy run a mile
And I bet, you guess, me right 
(You guess me, yes, you guessed me right)
I bet you guess me right---Lyrics submitted by Theresa.
