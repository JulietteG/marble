Well look at the world my friends
We used to live for the weekend
We don't live twice just let that sink in
I said when we colour the good days
The days we didn't need a stage
Just to have a room that's full of it

Oh I hope for the best
I'm prepared for the worst
If you were in my shoes
You wouldn't know, you wouldn't know, how it felt

You're always out for the highs
And never for the lows
You're always focused on my cons
And never on my pros (never on my pros)
You gotta keep the dream alive
Or else it will die
I long for the simple days
When things were less contrived

Oh I hope for the best
I'm prepared for the worst
If you were in my shoes
You wouldn't know, you wouldn't know, how it felt

And I don't know how, yeah I don't know how
We're gonna make it through this
We're gonna make it through this
Oh I don't know how
Oh I don't know how
We're gonna make it through this
We're gonna make it through it

Oh I hope for the best
I'm prepared for the worst
If you were in my shoes
You wouldn't know, you wouldn't know, how it felt
You wouldn't know, you wouldn't know, how it felt ---
