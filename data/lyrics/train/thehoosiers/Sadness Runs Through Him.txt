People are puppets held together with string 
There's a beautiful sadness that runs through him 
As he asked me to pray to the God he doesn't believe in 

Time and again boys are raised to be men 
Impatient they start, fearful at the end 
But here was a man mourning tomorrow 
He drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow 

He could not break surface tension 
He looked in the wrong place for redemption 
Don't look at me with those eyes 
I tried to unheave the ties 
Turn back the time that drew him 
But he couldn't be saved 
A sadness runs through him 
Through him 

Time and again boys are raised to be men 
Impatient they start, fearful at the end 
But here was a man mourning tomorrow 
Who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow 

He could not break surface tension 
He looked in the wrong place for redemption 
Don't look at me with those eyes 
I tried to unheave the ties 
Turn back the time that drew him 
But he couldn't be saved 
A sadness runs through him 
Through him 

Don't look 
Don't look 
Don't don't 

Don't look at me with those eyes 
I tried to unheave the ties 
Turn back the time that drew him 
But he couldn't be saved 
No he couldn't be saved 
A sadness runs through him 
A sadness runs through him 
A sadness runs through him 
A sadness runs through him 
A sadness runs through him---Lyrics submitted by James.
