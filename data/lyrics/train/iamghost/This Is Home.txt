Close your eyes 
It's easier that way... 
A golden cup 
And a toast to kings 
Lost and decayed, we are cut beyond our saving 
But we are home now, the room is still warm. 

I fell in love with an Angel, a heart that isn't cold 
Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on
Bless these shadows and tested every one 
They can't steal our love tonight. 

A century of open arms that shield the light 
This battle scar is healing 
Cast all the pain to the tourniquet that binds me 
But we are home now, the sun won't hurt you anymore... 

I fell in love with an Angel, a heart that isn't cold 
Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on 
Bless these shadows and tested everyone 
They can't steal our love tonight. 

Love has given me a reason to live... 
And love has given me a reason to die. 

I fell in love with an Angel, a heart that isn't cold
Say goodnight, we are dying, just hold on
Bless these shadows and tested everyone 
They can't steal our love tonight. 
I fell in love with an Angel, a heart that isn't cold, isn't cold, isn't cold
I can feel the pain of the sun as it lights up the air 
I can taste the hope, it's everywhere 

Love has given me reasons to live 
And love has given me a reason to say... goodbye.---Lyrics submitted by gtk.
