Fortune and Hades are the last hope, 
Swallow...
Forgive the Leper King and the hangman's gallows
Shark People Wear Shark Clothes!
The bite was ugly as sin...
But we were ready, disguised the malice stone
Our friend Lazarus sleeps, 
Her lips shake with every... with every word...
You were my favorite
We both know our love will never end
Comform me in, into the wicked...
Into the fallen mass grave four-legged dancers
Silence the Spider Queen and watch her eyes glow
Inside the fake I see, I'll burn this halo
Shark People Wear Shark Clothes!
The bite was ugly as SIN!!!
But we were ready, disguised the malice stone
Our friend Lazarus sleeps
Her lips shake with every, with every word
You were my favorite
We both know our love will never end
Conform me in, into the wicked
Into the fallen mass grave four legged dancers
(Whispers: just listen to these words i speak. The devil wants me dead, and the dark angels wants your soul, but i will never ever let them have you. I will never let you GO!)
You were my favorite
We both know our love will never end
Conform me in, into the wicked, into the...
You were my favorite
We both know our love will never end
Conform me in, into the wicked, into the young---Lyrics submitted by Lucy.
