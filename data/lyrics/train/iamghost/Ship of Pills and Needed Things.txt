Die by the sword
And the millions have taken away this reward
Stolen the laugh and a kiss
It was burned all in grey across her tender lips
Never the meek (in lust)
Forget what we've done(inside)
Protect what we built
Never ending
The ship of pills has crashed on heaven's shore
So kiss the girl, let the games begin with
broken arrows

Lakes and fire storm
Please wear my wings tonight
And shield the plague of birds
My voice screams for you
We are in love, I will never (never give up)
We are ageless, ageless

Tonight this is war
Allegiance of faith to the dead and shallow
I remember your kiss
Now it's burned all in grey across my tortured lips
Silently cast a shadow
Let these gates hear the crash and the scorn of two
lost lovers
So kiss the girl, let the games begin with
broken arrows

Lakes and fire storm
Please wear my wings tonight
And shield the plague of birds
My voice screams for you
We are in love, I will never (never give up)
We are ageless, ageless

Crashed the ships they built
Pills and needed things
Sink the bellow's core
Nomad repent silently
It's gifted, so gifted inspiration lost in its meaning
and unnoticed when explained

Lakes and fire storm
Please wear my wings tonight
And shield the plague of birds
My voice screams for you
Lakes and fire storm
Please wear my wings tonight
And shield the plague of birds
My voice screams for you
We are in love, I will never (never give up)
We are ageless, ageless
We are in love, I will never (never give up)
We are ageless, ageless
