This blood is mine, this blood is mine, 
this blood is mine, this blood is mine

This blood is blue, 
just don't forget it's mine! 
Kiss me now like you wanted
We will not die, and i will never ever tell, 
so kiss me now like you wanted
We will never tell just what you wanted from "Love"...
I cant breathe without you... and for today we will-
Just like an angel, she is just like you, 
the sixth dimension of emotion,
She turns my head, this bloody head, but today...
We will never tell just what you wanted from "Love"...
I can't breathe without you... and for today we will burn!!!
(inside of me, inside of me, we will burn!)

This blood is mine, this blood is mine, 
this blood is mine, this blood is mine!

We will never tell just what you wanted from "Love"...
I can't breathe without you... for today we will burn!
We will burn, yes this is mine, this is mine, this is mine! ---Lyrics submitted by Roy Mitchell.
