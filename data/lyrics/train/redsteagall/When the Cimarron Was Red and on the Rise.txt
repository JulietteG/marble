Riding back to Texas from a ride to Abilene
with the wagon, the remuda and the crew,
the Cimarron was boiling red and rising by the hour,
it was suicide to push the horses through.

Cotty Bill was pining by his Darling Anna Lee,
he left her crying back in San Anton.
A thousand times he red the note he carried in his jeans,
Cotty, darling, wont you hurry home.

But trailing longhorn cattle is a life at wild and free
and the prairie is a punchers paradise.
But it was dark and deadly in the spring of '83
when the Cimarron was red and on the rise.

We were at the wagon playin cards and tellin lies
when he announced that he was goin on.
We told him he was crazy, he would never make it through
but Cotty smiled and saddled up the roan.

Then I made him a promise; Id look after Anna Lee
in case he didnt make it through the night.
He turned his collar to the wind and bid us adios,
and whistling Dixie he ruled out of sight.

And trailing longhorn cattle is a life at wild and free,
but the devil is playing hell in paradise.
Cause it was dark and deadly in the spring of '83
when the Cimarron was red and on the rise.

It was nearly seven days before we got across,
the roan was in the shadow of a hill.
He was skinned from head to toe and covered up with mud,
but there was not a sing of Cotty Bill.

Oh, I guess we knew that he was gone when we looked anyhow
the road for a mile and searched on either side.
We combed the brush and dragged our ropes in every waterhole,
but Cotty Bill had taken his last ride.

And I kept my promise and I married Anna Lee,
and the boy were raising has his daddys eyes.
Someday Ill tell him more about the spring of 83
when the Cimarron was red and on the rise.

Cause it was dark and deadly in the spring of '83
when the Cimarron was red and on the rise.---Lyrics submitted by Jos-Fernando Rey Ballesteros.
