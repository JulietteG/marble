We are the strange, we are injected
We are the cure, we are infected
We are the cracks you cant repair
You are the righteous ones, you are the righteous ones

We are the freaks, we are the queers
We are the shockers, we are all here
Theres something coming, its in the air
You are the righteous ones, you are the righteous ones

You can close your eyes if you want to
Lock your doors and hide if we haunt you
Get your guns tonight if we scare you
But we aint goin nowhere, no, we aint goin nowhere

You can pass a law if you need to
Punch us in the jaw when we beat you
Use your shock and awe if you dare to
But we aint goin nowhere, no we aint goin nowhere

We are the gods, we are the stars
We are the lovers who rule the arts
We are the nerds, we are the spark
You cant deny us, you cant deny us

You can close your eyes if you want to
Lock your doors and hide if we haunt you
Get your guns tonight if we scare you
But we aint goin nowhere, no we aint goin nowhere

You can pass a law if you need to
Punch us in the jaw when we beat you
Use your shock and awe if you dare to
But we aint goin nowhere, no we aint goin nowhere

We can turn the pleasure into suffering
Do it under pressure when its happening
We can see the treasure inside everything
Inside everything, inside everything

We can turn the pleasure into suffering
Do it under pressure when its happening
We can see the treasure inside everything
Inside everything, inside everything

You can close your eyes if you want to
Lock your doors and hide if we haunt you
Get your guns tonight if we scare you
But we aint goin nowhere, no we aint goin nowhere

You can pass a law if you need to
Punch us in the jaw when we beat you
Use your shock and awe if you dare to
But we aint goin nowhere, no we aint goin nowhere

We can turn the pleasure into suffering
Do it under pressure when its happening
We can see the treasure inside everything
Inside everything, inside everything

We can turn the pleasure into suffering
Do it under pressure when its happening
We can see the treasure inside everything
Inside everything---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
