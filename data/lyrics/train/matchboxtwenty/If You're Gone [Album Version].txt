I think I've already lost you
I think you're already gone 
I think I'm finally scared now 
You think I'm weak
But I think you're wrong

I think you're already leaving
Feels like your hand is on the door 
I thought this place was an empire 
But now I'm relaxed and I can't be sure

And I think you're so mean I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life 
And I think I'm scared and I think too much
I know it's wrong It's a problem I'm dealing
If you're gone Maybe I's time to come home 
'Cause There's an awful lot of breathing room 
But I can hardly move
If you're gone baby you need to come home
There's a little bit of something me 
In everything in you

I'll bet you're hard to get over 
And I'll bet the room just won't shine 
But I'll bet my hands I can stay here 
And I'll bet you need more than you mind

And I think you're so mean I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life 
And I think I'm scared that I know too much
I can't relate And that's a problem I'm dealing
If you're gone maybe it's time to come home
'CauseThere's an awful lot of breathing room 
But I can hardly move
If you're gone baby you need to come home (come home)
There's a little bit of something me 
In everything in you

Well I think you're so mean I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life 
And I think I'm scared do I talk too much?
I know It's wrong It's a problem I'm dealing 
If you're gone Maybe I's time to come home 
'Cause There's an awful lot of breathing room 
But I can hardly move
Well If you're gone baby you need to come home (come home)
There's a little bit of something me 
In everything in you.---Lyrics submitted by Ron.
