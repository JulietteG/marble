Come inside
The air I breathe
While the band still plays
It's the end of the coldest week
Come down into the sea

Cause everybody wants to get away sometimes
And everybody needs mistakes

When the sun breaks
Over the edge of an English town
It pulls me away
From a bad dream
I don't know why
But I know I'm not
Ever going back

In the dark we can lose our sleep
We can both be kind
Cause I don't need the pulling apart of sheets
Just to know who you are

When everybody wants to get away from something
Everybody lose their way

When the sun breaks
Over the edge of an English town
It pulls me away
From a bad dream
I don't know why
But I know I'm not
Ever going back

It's a non stop voice
That can lead you on
But cannot change it

When the sun breaks
Over the edge of an English town
When the sun breaks
Over the edge of an English town
When the sun breaks
Over the edge of an English town

la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la-la-la
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh---
