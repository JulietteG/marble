Well, well

[Chorus]
its gonna be nice
Its gonna be nice
What ever is in store for me its gonna be nice
It crazy right now lord but thats when you'll shine
I cant stop shouting oh its gonna be nice

Well well,
You never promised me that my days will be problem free
But you did promise to always take care of me
Right now it seems that my troubles will never end
I know you promise to be my closest friend
And its gonna be nice 

[Chorus]

Well Well,
A gotta remind myself daily who lives inside of me
And when i stay close to you, close to me you're gonna be
No more crying about my situation I know what I gotta do
I gotta pray, gotta trust, gotta believe
Depend on you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I dont have the right to give up

You're gonna bring me through sure

I dont have the right to give up
I dont have the right to give in
You always brought me through so Im gonna put my my my my trust in you

[Chorus]

Its crazy right now lord but thats when you'll shine
I cant stop shouting oh its gonna be nice.---Lyrics submitted by Tavi.
