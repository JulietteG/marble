Shattered, but I'm not broken
Wounded, still time will heal
Heavy the load, the cross I bear
Lonely, the road I trod I dare

Shaken, but here I stand
Weary, Still I press on
Long are the nights, the tears I cry
Dark are the days, no sun in the sky

Yet, Still I Rise
Never to give up
Never to give in
Against all odds

Yet, Still I rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel low
Yet Still I Rise

Sometimes, I'm troubled
But not in despair
Struggling, I make my way through
Trials, they come, to make me strong 
I must endure, I must..... hold on

Yet, Still I Rise
Never to give up
Never to give in
Against all odds

Yet, Still I Rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel low
Yet Still I Rise

Above all my problems
Above all my eyes can see
Knowing God is able
To Strengthen me
To Strengthen me

Yet, Still I Rise
Never to give up
Oh , Never to give in
Against all odds

Yet, Still I...... Rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel low

Yet, Still I.....
I need to know.. which way to go

Yet, Still I....
At times I feel low...

Yet, Still I....
Oh... I........
Rise


Yet, Still I...... Rise---Lyrics submitted by Ranesha.
