I say a prayer every night, whatever I do, I'll get it right
 With no regret, no guilt or shame this time, no not this time
 Once I surrender, I won't dare look back, cause if I do, I'll get off track
 Move ahead in faith, and patiently await your answer, what will it be

[Chorus:]
 Sight beyond what I see
 You know what's best for me
 Prepare my mind, prepare my heart
 For whatever comes, I'm gone' be ready

Strength to pass any test
 I feel like I'm so blessed
 With you in control, I can't go wrong
 'Cause I always know, I'm gonna be ready

I was free to do, what I wanted to, lost everything, but I still had you
 You showed me your grace, now my life's renewed and I thank you, yes.. I thank 
You
 So I'll tell anyone who'll listen, I'll testify
 About how good you were to me, when so call friends passed me by
 The fact that you would show somebody so broke down, so-much-merccccyyy...

[Chorus:]
 Sight beyond what I see BEYOND WHAT I SEE
 You know what's best I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR ME 
Prepare my mind...PREPARE MY MIND AND PREPARE MY HEART
 For whatever comes...FOR WHATEVER COMES I GONNA BE READY

Strength to pass any test GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO PASS ANY TEST
 I feel like I'm so blessed I KNOW THAT I'M SO BLESSED
 With you in control...YOUR IN CONTROL LORD, CAN'T GO WRONG NO 
'Cause I always know...CAUSE I KNOW THAT I'M GONNA BE READY

So use me as you will, I'll pay the price
 'Cause made the ultimate sacrifice
 It's all because of you, that I even have life
 And I'll give my love, as a tribute, to how great you are...

[Chorus:]
 Sight beyond what I see BEYOND WHAT I SEE
 You know what's best I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR ME OHH OOHH
 Prepare my mind...PREPARE MY HEART AND PREPARE MY MIND
 For whatever ...FOR WHATEVER COMES I GONNA BE READY YEAH YEAH YEAH

Strength to pass any test I WANNA PASS THIS TEST
 I feel like...I KNOW THAT I AM, KNOW THAT I AM, KNOW THAT I'M SO BLESSED
 With you in...YOUR IN CONTROL OF MY LIFE LORD, I CAN'T GO WRONG NO 
'Cause I always know...AND I KNOW IT I'M GONNA BE I'M GONNA BE READY 

I'm gonna be ready THIS TIME I'M GONNA BE
 I'm gonna be ready CAUSE YOU LIVE DEEP INSIDE OF ME
 I'm gonna be ready AND I KNOW IT'S IN YOUR WILL FOR ME TO BE READY
 YEAH YEAH YEAH UUUHHHHH
 I'M GONNA BE READY---Lyrics submitted by Kabria Murphy.
