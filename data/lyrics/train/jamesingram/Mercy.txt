my tears are dry
dry tears so full of sorrows
Troubled am I  - hoping You'll see tomorrow
save this heart and soul- Save this soul

I hear a sound
beyond the distance crying
Black winds blow cold
where dreams are dying
Jesus wont you pleaseeeeeeeeee

 (have mercy-have mercy on me)
and I Know I'm so weak so weak and your strong
 (Jesus)
take him by the hand and lead him on
 (have mercy-have mercy on me)
 Have mercy-have mercy.Oh

I speak Your name
Oh Lord please hear me callin
He's lost his way- help him to keep from falling
Tell me that you will - i know you will

Praise be Thy name
oh Lord a God of mercy
help ease my pain
wash all these sins away
Jesus wont you please

(have mercy-have mercy on me)
have mercy on me-
(Jesus)
help him climb to the mountaintop
(Jesus)
Bring my baby home he's all l got
(Jesus)
send away all my stumbling blocks
hey-hey
 (have mercy-have mercy on me)
have mercy on me Jesus
 (Jesus)
forgive my son for all the wrong he's done
(Jesus)
on my Knees I'm beggin  you please
(Jesus)
Oh let the winds let the  trumpet sound
Let the little lamb be found
(Jesus-Jesus-Jesus)
Jesus
have mercy
do   oh Lordy    
 who do I lean on
have mercy---Lyrics submitted by joshua tuisawau.
