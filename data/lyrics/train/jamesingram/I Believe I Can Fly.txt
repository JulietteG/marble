I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But  now I know the meaning of true love
Im leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, heres nothing to it

Refrain:
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, heres nothing to it
 (repeat refrain)

Hey cuz I believe in me, oh
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, heres nothing to it

(repeat refrain)---Lyrics submitted by ANTHONY.
