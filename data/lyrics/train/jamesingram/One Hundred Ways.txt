Compliment what she does
Send her roses just because
If it's violins, she loves
Let them play 
Dedicate her favorite song
And hold her closer
All nite long
Love her today
Find one hundred ways
Don't forget, there could be
An old lover in her memory
If you need her so much more 
Why don't you say
Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay
Find one hundred ways
Bein' cool won't help you keep a love warm
You'll just blow your only chance 
Take the time to open up your heart
That's the secret of romance
Sacrifice, if you care 
Buy her some moonlight to wear
If there's one more star she wants
Go all the way
In your arms tonight, she'll reflect
That she owes you, the sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay
Find one hundred ways
Love her today
Find one hundred ways---Lyrics submitted by cedric.
