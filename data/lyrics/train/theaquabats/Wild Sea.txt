We ride the Wild Sea
and if you want adventure it's the pace to be.
The sea wolves and the giant squids
are comin' up from the Wild Sea. 

And here's we'll stay
for ten years and a day.
We're on a quest to find hidden treasure,
a mystery of the Wild Sea.

Now the sun, she's shining, for everyone,
but we'll set sail
and we'll be gone,
we're sailing on,
we're sailing on,

CHORUS
Sailing on, and on and on and on,
into the ocean, into the sun,
my boat, a viking, my dad and me,
on the Wild Sea! x2

Now we're taking on water in the dead dogs galley,
a man overboard every day.
Captured by pirates in the Isle of Donuts,
rescued by some maidens who then ran away

And here's where we'll be,
ya never know what we'll see,
we can battle ghosts at the bottom of the ocean,
or ride the waves of the Wild Sea. 

And now the sun, she's shining, on everyone,
but we'll set sail
and we'll be gone, 
we're sailing on, 
we're sailing on,

CHORUS x2

(spoken)
Captain's log, 1978. 
We've been on the sea now for over three years,
and the unbelievable things we've found and seen,
no man can write.
Things like the discovery of the Purple Pearl of Panash, 
the mysterious island of Bigfoot women, 
the sea ghosts on the Isle of Tread,
pirates on the sea, pirates that no man can name. 
The underwater bison family,
and much more... homeboy. 

CHORUS x2

Do you hear that, son?
That's the voice of the Sirens,
calling from the sea.
Quick! Put some cloth in your ears.
Don't steer toward the island.

The Wild Sea is calling me! x4---Lyrics submitted by Nicholas.
