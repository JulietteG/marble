I cant open the door to my car anymore
But I dont care
You dont call me on the phone anymore
But I dont care
I got hit on the head with my new surfboard
And its making me bored
Cuz I dont know I dont care anymore

I got a littering ticket at the dump
Such a tragedy
My parents fired me for mowing my lawn
Finally
My hair gels obsolete
My shoes dont fit on my feet
Juicy Fruits not as sweet
Cuz I dont know I dont care anymore

Must be a voodoo doll with my name on it
Maybe a black cat has crossed my path
But I never get sad and I never look back

Cuz no matter what I do
I just cant lose
And even if I do
Ill jump your bike
Right off of your roof
Cuz if I crash real bad
Your sister will think Im rad
No matter, no matter what I do
I just cant lose

I stepped on a crack and
It broke my mommas back
But shes okay
Im a hypochondriac and
I think I had a heart attack
But Im okay
Things are looking up
Didnt get hit by a bus
Maybe Im starting to care
A little more than before

Must be a voodoo doll with my name on it
Maybe a black cat has crossed my path
But I never get sad and I never look back

Cuz no matter what I do
I just cant lose
And even if I do
Ill jump your bike
Right off of your roof
Cuz if I crash real bad
Your sister will think Im rad
No matter, no matter what I do
I just cant lose

Yeah I broke my leg but
I guess thats just my style
Its a victory because
It made your mamma smile

Cuz no matter what I do
I just cant lose
And even if I do
Ill jump your bike
Right off of your roof
Cuz if I crash real bad
Your sister will think Im rad
No matter, no matter what I do
I just cant lose

And even if I do I can always move
And even if I do
I can auction off all of your shoes---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
