I put my head down on my desk, 
to help me get through this mess.
I fell asleep and before I was done,
I woke up in shock; my whole am was numb.
I woke up in shock my whole arm was numb.
I woke up in shock-

CHORUS
I fell asleep on my arm, and now it's totally numb!
I fell asleep on my arm! My arm's like a big limp stump! x3

The bell rang; class dismissed,
I'm sitting here a little bit dissed,
I step to the door, but I can't leave,
I can't turn the doorknob; my arm's asleep.
I can't turn the doorknob; my arms asleep.
Who's gonna carry my books? I'm so embarrassed.
What if I got to pee? I can't bear it.
What if I got to pee? I can't bear it.

CHORUS x3

Corporate America makes pencils for the man with the right hand. 
They make pencils for the man with the left hand.
But what about the man with the numb hand?
Four hundred grand to see the Rage, 
but from back here I can't see the stage.
It's time to start my own parade,
so lift your arm up and wave!

I fell asleep on my arm, and now it's totally numb, 
I fell asleep on my arm; my shoulder's like a big limp stump!
I fell asleep on my arm; my arm's like a big limp stump!

I feel no pain
in my arm.
I feel no pain
in my arm. 
When's it gonna change?
It feels so strange
It's just one of those days
In my arm
I'm gonna slam it in the door
I'm gonna wiggle it around
'Cause I feel no pain
In my arm
It feels so strange
It's just one of those days.

Boom da bop da boom diggy diggy...---Lyrics submitted by Nicholas.
