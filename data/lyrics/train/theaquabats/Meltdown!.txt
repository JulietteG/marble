I am just a man
I do the things I can
there is capacity
for I am a human
cars and radios
television codes
noisy animals
jam transitions
I will go to work
just like captain Kirk
I will hear the noise
the standard feedback
I will smell Chee-tos
that is how it goes
and then the nachos in my head explode, yeah!

And then he had a meltdown
he had a meltdown
he didn't wanna
he didn't wanna
have a meltdown
but he had one
and then he had a meltdown
he had a meltdown
well he was tryin'
really really tryin
not to have one
but he had one!

I cannot control
I am overload
so many of these things
can control me
there is Murphy's law
there is Newton's law
things go wrong
and then they
then fall down on me
why so many things
change around me?
What? my comfort zone
has been invaded
it has come to this
and no I must
and now I must surgically remove myself!

And then he had a meltdown
he had a meltdown
he didn't wanna
he didn't wanna
have a meltdown
but he had one
and then he had a meltdown
he had a meltdown
well he was tryin'
really really tryin
not to have one
but he had one!

And then he had a meltdown
he had a meltdown

he had a meltdown
well he was tryin'

not to have one
but he had one! 

And then he had a meltdown
he had a meltdown
he didn't wanna
he didn't wanna
have a meltdown
but he had one
and then he had a meltdown
he had a meltdown
well he was tryin'
really really tryin
not to have one---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
