Uh oh, uh oh - Whoopsie!
Uh oh, uh oh - Whoopsie!
Uh oh, uh oh - Whoopsie!
Uh oh, uh oh

I had a birthday and grandma gave me money
She said
"Don't spend it all in one place, honey"
Then I got twenty bucks for Columbus Day
And I found sixty-five in The Everglades
Oh can't you see me check... a look at me
Running round town on a shopping spree
G-G-Got some new skis
And some break dance shoes
Like boogaloo shrimp
And a shabba-doo!

I spent all my money! I can't believe myself
I spent all my money! I can't believe myself
Uh oh, uh oh - Whoopsie!
Uh oh, uh oh

I bought some tropical fish
For my Japanese cat
And some ostrich feathers
For my black leather hat
Got some shiny gold rings
And an X-ray machine
So I can take a few pictures Of the inside of me
Oh can't you see me
Can't you see me oh?
Running round town like an Eskimo
In a fuzzy fur coat
On a fondue bike
This is my money baby
Gonna buy what I like

I spent all my money! I can't believe myself
I spent all my money! I can't believe myself
I spent all my money! I can't believe myself
I spent all my money! I can't believe myself
(Whoops!I dropped it, I dropped it, I dropped)

You got some money
And POOF!! It's gone again
That's just the way it goes
No No No don't you worry
You just go to grandma's house
That's where the money tree grows!

So come one come on come on
Let's spend some money now
come on come on come on
Roll up those quarters
come on come on come on
Let's spend some money now
come on come on come on

I spent all my money! I can't believe myself
I spent all my money! I can't believe myself
I spent all my money! I can't believe myself
I spent all my money! I can't believe myself

Whoops!---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
