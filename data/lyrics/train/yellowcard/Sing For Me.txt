Look at me, and listen close
so i can tell you how i feel before i go
just a year, it's not much time
for me to show you
i am proud that you are mine
i wish i had known 
the future in my heart was just about to start

Chorus
say tomorrow, i can't follow (you there)
just close your eyes
and sing for me
i will hear you, always near you
and i'll give you the words [ahhahhahh]
just sing for me

every lock on every door
i put them there
 to try and hide you from the world
and you kicked, yeah you screamed
and never understood you're everything to me
i just hope you know
the future in your heart is just about to start

Chorus #2

no looking back when i am gone [sing for me]
follow your heart it's never wrong [sing for me]
no looking back when i am gone [sing for me]
don't second guess the note you're on [sing for me]

(all) out of time, all out of fight
you're (you are) the only thing in life that i got right

Chorus #3
