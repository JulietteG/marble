Its 4am, you call to spit some fire out
But did you think that I would listen to you now?
Its nothing new so get in line with all the rest
And I will wait till you realize youre out of breath

Can you hear the crowd? They all go wild
For you and your denial
Theyre watching you break down(Break Down)
Hate me all you want, Ill be okay
Im half the world away
Im letting you go now (Go Now)

Youve got sadness twisted up with jealousy
You show your fists to make them look like loyalty
And I have seen what holding on can take away
If its the past you love then thats where you can stay

Can you hear the crowd? They all go wild
For you and your denial
Theyre watching you break down (break down)
Hate me all you want, Ill be okay
Im half the world away
Im letting you go now (go now)
Go Now (go now)

Desperation kills
But when its on your sleeve you wear it well
Underneath it all youll always have this war inside yourself

Im letting you go now (go now)
Can you hear the crowd?
They all go wild
For you and your denial
Theyre watching you break down (break down)
Hate me all you want, Ill be okay
Im half the world away
Im letting you go now (go now)
Go Now (go now)
Go Now (go now)
Go Now (go now)---Lyrics submitted by nowanadzieja95@gmail.
