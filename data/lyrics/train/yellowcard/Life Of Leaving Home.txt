I can see all the footsteps left behind,
Every second I gave
Every song was a snapshot of my mind,
I needed something to say

Started out in the last slow-motion scene,
Watching everyone change
Made a map of the one-way road from here,
Had no reason to stay

I am awake and alive
There is something caling me
More than a moment in time,
Its a dream I'm following
On my own (on my own)
On my own
More than a moment in time
It's a life of leaving home

Think of me when the start come out toningt
Take a look at the sky
I never said that I could burn out that bright,
But I needed to try

I am awake and alive,
There is something calling me
More than a moment in time,
It's a dream I'm following
On my own (on my own)
On my own
More than a moment in time
It's a life of leaving home

The day that I found my voice, 
I knew that I had no choice
The only way I'd ever learn to love,
Is if I found it 
On my own,
On my own

I am awake and alive,
There is something calling me
More than a moment in time,
It's a dream I'm following
On my own (on my own)
On my own
On my own
On my own
More than a moment in time
It's a life of leaving home---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
