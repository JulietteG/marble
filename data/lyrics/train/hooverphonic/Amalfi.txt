Morning sunshine
You are always smiling when I open my....
My eyes do shine
Radiate like a nuclear dense cloud

You're like a real strong cup of tea
Giving me more than energy
Caffeine is just a small advance
For all the triggers that make me

Na nana nana nananana boy you make me dance
Na nana nana nananana you put me in a trance

Good night sleep tight
feels as if I could swim across the ocean
My Film star
Playing the lead in my nightly stop motion

Ginseng is weak compared to you
I'm wandering round without a clue
By enforcing my sweet fantasy
My pheromones are making me

Like the amalfi
Coast you are wildly curling beautiful
Hypno-tising
Water makes me fond of the un useful

Long time ago I fell for you
But we had so much more to do
It took a while to synchronize
But now we're locked it makes me---
