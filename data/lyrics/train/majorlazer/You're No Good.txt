(Intro)
Youre no good for me
But the way you movin at me, oh it might be
You want a Jamaican one

(Verse)
She say she love me and Im nice
Nothing after he return, nothing at the night
She say its loving, make this down
No time at all, she dont wanna line
She touch me, it all become nice
She love me, for the rest of her life
D drop it down, round kiss on mi spine
Touch and make a sweet song, on top of all things

My uh uh uh uh uh
My ee ee ee ee ee
My uh uh uh uh uh (my baby)

(Chorus)
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
I know youll come back around
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
You want a Jamaican one
I know youll come back around

(Verse)
If I had you back
Ill never let you go another way
Not for the life of me
How could you imagine that?
Well my mistake that send you on your way
Well nothing I can say
To you like drops of water
Dont ask me what went wrong
Cant turn back the damage Ive done
Cant take em back after Im gone
A fool to keep on trying
Cant make me walk away
Cause baby Im back and as Im getting strung that youll be back one day
(Chorus)
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
I know youll come back around
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
You want a Jamaican boy
I know youll come back around

(Verse)
Girl you think you love me baby
And you know so mi love is for my lady
Deserve no faith to deserve no Slim Shady
Go Shawty, its yo birthday
No if and no maybe
Take and attack it, youre the thing, ordinary
Me as boyfriend, girl come on and come save me
Me and youre tinking me, com e with me
Surely inside the long shorty
Til it wind, pan the flow and wind, pan the flow
And if you want to get girls that do me
Come here, lick it more, lick it more
Mean everything, as I me love you
So no one kill how I ever want
Any time, get chug upon the doorway
Man rest assured, pan the girl next door
Oh yes I did did

My uh uh uh uh uh
My melodea
My ee ee ee ee ee
I know youll come back around
My uh uh uh uh uh
My melodea
My ee ee ee ee ee
I know youll come back around now

Youre no good for me
But the way you movin at me, oh it might be
No one ever made me feel so sweet
Now you got me begging on my knees
Baby get it for me
Its for your eyes only, living for you solely
Its for your eyes only, living for you solely
Its for your eyes only, living for you solely
Its for your eyes only, living for you solely

(x2)
Its for your eyes only, living for you solely
Its for your eyes only, living for you solely
Its for your eyes only, living for you solely
Its for your eyes only, living for you solely

(Chorus x2)
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
I know youll come back around
My aa aa aa aa me
My melodea
My L L L LSD
I know youll come back around
