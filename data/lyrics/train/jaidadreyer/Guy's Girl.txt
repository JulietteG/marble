I like football sittin' in trees 
K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
I like snakes, snails, and puppy dog tails 
drinking long necks iced down in a pale 
I like cowboy boots and old guitars 
ridin' shot gun in muscle cars 
I like a good cigar every now and then 
what can I say I'm attracted to men 

I'm a guys girl 
in a guys world 
its all good if you like what you see 
don't be shy go on and whistle at me 
'cause in a guys world 
I'm a guys girl 
lucky for me 
yeah yeah 

I like southern rock on my radio 
and in the back of my truck i've got a fishin' pole 
I like counting the stars on a dropped tailgate 
now thats my kinda perfect date 
I hate doing my hair and I don't like to shop 
its okay we don't have to talk about nothing 
but i was wondering could you blow off work and just take me hunting 

I'm a guys girl in a guys world 
its all good if you like what you see 
don't be shy go on and whistle at me 
'cause in a guys world 
I'm a guys girl 
lucky for me your like you 
lucky for you I'm like me 

cause I'm a guys girl 
in a guys world 
its all good dontcha worry 'bout me 
I won't say L-O-V-E 
'cause in a guys world 
I'm a guys girl 
lucky for me 
I'm a guys girl 
lucky for me 
(yeah yeah) 

makes me go 
do do do do do do do do do do do 
I like football sittin' in trees 
K-I-S-S-I-N-G---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
