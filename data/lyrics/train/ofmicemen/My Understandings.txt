I don't mind it
I don't mind if you're overrated
Or if you're staring at the edge of the world
But keep in mind that I'm a sore eye, with blurry vision
But I can see, yeah it has to be you love
That I've been dreaming of and if we climb this high
I swear we'll never die

Yeah

I don't mind it
I don't mind if you're overrated,
Or if you're staring at the edge of the world
But keep in mind that I'm a sore eye, with blurry vision
But I can see, yeah it has to be you love
That I've been dreaming of and if we climb this high
I swear we'll never die
I'll never die---Lyrics submitted by Kourtnie McCoy.
