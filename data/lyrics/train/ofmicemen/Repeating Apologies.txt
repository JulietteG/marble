I hope you know, 
I swear Ive never done this before, 
And I care, Im so sorry
Scarred you for life, please come back to me, 
Down on my knees, repeating apologies

Why do I deny the heart thats grown colder? 
Too quick to criticize the lullaby
Why do I deny the heart thats grown colder? 
Too quick to criticize 
Sweet serenity. I wish you, sweet serenity

Back on mistakes Ive made, please come home to me. 
Ill show you truth. Im all for you
Ill hold your hand, ease your mind, yeah well be okay, 
Repeating apologies 

Why do I deny stay here with me, 
Let what I am, let it speak more
More than words they cant compete with
Its always been you and me

Why do I deny the heart thats grown colder? 
Too quick to criticize the lullaby
Why do I deny the heart thats grown colder? 
Too quick to criticize 
Sweet serenity I wish you, sweet serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
Ive never done this before, done this before, and I 
I hope you know, I hope you know, 
Baby youre not alone, youre not alone 
(Youve ruined me) I hope you know
I swear Ive never done this before, and I care

I bet youre sorry
Youve lied to my face 
All these words that I say, 
are the words I wanted to hear from you to me.---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
