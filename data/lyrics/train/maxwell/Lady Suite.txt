It's been so long since I've seen you
and your chocolate legs wrapped around me
Your sexy smell drives me crazy
Let's get married

Suitelady...Will you marry me?

I never thought I would ever
Want matrimony forever
But you brought that Suite deep familiar
Let's get married

Suitelady...Will you marry me?

Hey!
What you wanna do with me?
Do you wanna be with me?
C'mon baby let's get married?
Hey! ---Lyrics submitted by ShaheedMuhammad.
