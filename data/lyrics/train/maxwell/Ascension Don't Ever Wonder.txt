Oooooh...

It happened the moment, when you were revealed
'Cause you were a dream that you should not have been
A fantasy real
You gave me this beating baby
This rhythm inside
And you made me feel good and feel nice and feel loved
Give me paradise

So shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder

So tell me how long
How long it's gonna take until you speak, babe
'Cause I can't live my life
Without you here by my side
Ooh...
You gave me the feelin', feelin' in my life---
