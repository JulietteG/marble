In the light of the sun
I was dazed, I was burned, I was lost
Deep in the storm of a grave
Had a bed as a coffin
You were only the one that made me fulfilled
Only the thing that made me reveal
My destiny was before us, beach of a forest
Anything ain't nothing, it's just

It's just you, just us
Nobody but love
On trust, on us, nobody now
Can we swim a lake by the ocean
We'll be one like drops in slow motion
Lake by the ocean

Oh tell me the way that is
Waves like it is the drops of colors
Why do I live inside of you baby
Want to be every part of you
It's just, it's just right, it's just left
We can be strong, we can wave, we can live oh so long
Live in a flame where we'll never burn
No one could ever, ever return
You are reason I'm on ya, reason I love ya
You're the thing I need cause it's just

It's just you, just us
Nobody but love
On trust, on us, nobody now
Can we swim a lake by the ocean
We'll be one like drops in slow motion
Lake by the ocean

All I see is just
Everything is lust
Lake by the ocean
Sweet like the motion
Love is the medicine
I can heal us
All I see is love
All I want
Is love

It's just you, us, body, love
Trust, us
(Lake by the ocean)
Can we swim a lake by the ocean
(Lake by the, by the ocean)
Drops slow motion
Lake by the ocean---
