HE THINKS I STILL CARE

JUST BECAUSE I ASKED A FRIEND ABOUT HIM
JUST BECAUSE I SPOKE HIS NAME SOMEWHERE
JUST BECAUSE I RANG HIS NUMBER BY MISTAKE TODAY
HE THINKS I STILL CARE

JUST BECAUSE I HUNG THE SAME OLE PLACES
WELL THE MEMORY OF HIM LINGERS EVERWHERE
JUST BECAUSE IM NOT THE HAPPY GIRL I USE TO BE
HE THINKS I STILL CARE

BUT IF HES HAPPY THINKIN I STILL NEED HIM
THEN LET THAT SILLY NOTION BRING HIM TEARS
OH HOW COULD HE EVER BE SO FOOLISH
OH WHERE WOULD HE GET SUCH AN IDEA

JUST BECAUSE I ASKED A FRIEND ABOUT HIM
JUST BECAUSE I SPOKE HIS NAME SOMEWHERE
JUST BECAUSE I SAW HIM THEN WENT ALL TO PIECES
HE THINKS I STILL CARE
HE THINKS I STILL CARE---Lyrics submitted by Marie.
