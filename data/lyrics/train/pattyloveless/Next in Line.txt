see him there at the table 
watch him tear at the label
from the bottle that he just drank dry
in his mind theres a burning
it took a long time but he's learning
and just look at the tear drops hes cried

chorus
everybody knows i love him
but his mind is on another
and just look at what shes done to his pride
and if he should change his mind
give up the music and the wine
ill be standing by to be the next in line

i know his favirote song so well
and hes happy i can tell
just as long as he can hear the jukebox play
so ill keep playin it loud
ill spend every dime i had to keep him happy
in my own kind of way

repeat chorus

yes, ill be standing by to be the next in line---Lyrics submitted by Marie.
