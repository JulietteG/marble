I been burning Bright
For so long I can't remember
Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I can't stay this high forever
This man's had all he can stand, time to lay this body down

Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart I've been livin in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
And my bark will lose it's bite
But don't give up on me
Sweet Annie.

Sweet Annie
I know I promised you a life
But an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, Find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and I pray it's not too late

Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart I've been livin in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
And my bark will lose it's bite
But don't give up on me
What will be will be

Sweet Annie.

Turn out the lights
These hands alone to hold you
Fall all over you
All over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over, and over again

Ohhh...

Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart I've been livin in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
And my bark will lose it's bite
But don't' give up on me

Sweet Annie.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
