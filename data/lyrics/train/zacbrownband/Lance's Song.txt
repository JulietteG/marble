Anybody here, pass me a beer
And Im a keep playing this music that you hear
And if you know the song, then come and sing along with me
Walking with the beach to my left, sea to my right
And Im gonna get faded at the tiki bar tonight
Then Im a roll one up, like my name is Bob, yea
Im a party like Im a Jamaican

If you really wanna know, where you can find me
Ill be unwinding
Down in the islands, down in the islands
The ocean, lose track of your timing
Grab a drink beside me
Down in the islands, down in the islands

And Anybody here, pass me the rum
Then we can find somebody that can play the steel drums
And if you like the speed, then everybody dance with me

We got the ladies to the left, the fellas to the right
And everybodys faded at the tiki bar tonight
Then were all gonna dance to the rhythm of the waves
While we drink Bacardi by the bon fire flames

If you really wanna know where you can find me
Ill be unwinding
Down in the islands, down in the islands
The ocean, lose track of your timing
Grab a drink beside me
Down in the islands, down in the islands

You dont need, no invitation no
If youre looking for relaxation
Get away, get away with me
Make your destination, my location

If you really wanna know where you can find me
Ill be unwinding
Down in the islands, down in the islands
The ocean, lose track of your timing
Grab a drink beside me
Down in the islands, down in the islands

If you really wanna know where you can find me
Ill be unwinding
Down in the islands, down in the islands
The ocean, lose track of your timing
Grab a drink beside me
Down in the islands, down in the islands---
