(You're a capsule)
Borrowed from the ground
Forced into a lie
You create an assembly of thoughts
A network inside

Burrowed and ripped from your sleep
Taken away from the things
That you weren't able to keep

The days are numbered
We're watching closely
The time has come
The decision will be made

One day your vision will return

Burrowed and ripped from your sleep
Taken away from the things
That you weren't able to keep

Now at the crossroads
Will you grab control
And save yourself? (save yourself)
Have you not learned a lesson?
Being alive means changing your mind

Keep telling yourself
That if there's anything wrong
There's no need to worry
No need to think for yourself
x2

Oh!
And now there's nothing to be done with the rest of your life

Borrowed from the ground
Forced into a lie
You create an assembly of thoughts
A network inside---Lyrics submitted by Logan Pollaro.
