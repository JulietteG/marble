(Say it)
(Say it isn't so)
(Say it)
(Say it isn't so)

Say it isn't so painful
To tell me that you're dissatisfied
Last time I asked you
I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen
You see 'em goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way
That bites it even more
(Say it)
Tell me what you want, yeah
I'll do it, baby
I promise right now
(Say it)
Who propped you up
When you were stopped low motivation
had you on the ground
I know your first reaction
You slide away
Hide away, goodbye
But if there's a doubt
Maybe I can give out
A thousand reasons why
You have to say it isn't so
(It isn't so)
I say it isn't so (it isn't so)
Oh, no
I say it isn't so (it isn't so)
Oh, say it isn't so (it isn't so)
Oh-oh, no
(Say it)
We like to be the strangers
At the party
Two rebels in a shell (say it)
You like to move
With the best of them
You know we move so well
Don't need someone to lean on
I know where there's an open door
But if I'm faced
With being replaced
I want you even more
So baby, say it isn't so (it isn't so)
Oh-oh, say it isn't so (it isn't so)
oh-oh, no
Say it isn't so (it isn't so)
Whoooa, say it isn't so (it isn't so)
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
(Say it)
(Say it isn't so)
(Say it)
(Say it isn't so)
(Say it)
(Say it isn't so)

Why you gonna go
Do you half ta say
You wanna go
Ooh-ooh baby, say it isn't
(Say it isn't)
Say, say, say it isn't
(Say it isn't) so (so, say it isn't)
Why do you have to say it isn't
(Say it isn't) so
(Say it isn't) so (say, say it isn't)
I know it's so hard for you (say it isn't)
So hard (say it isn't)
Don't say, baby (so, say it isn't)
There must be some other way
Don't have to (say it isn't)
Some other way (So say it isn't)
Aah, you don't have to say (say it isn't) ---
