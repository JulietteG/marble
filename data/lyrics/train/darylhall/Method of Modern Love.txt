In the moonlite
Under startlite
Songs old as the night are what I've been dreaming of
Everybody's hard as iron
Locked in a modern world
Dreams are make of a different stuff

I believe love will always be the same
Ways and means are the parts subject to change
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love

I can call you
Got your number
Share my life with you a thousand miles away
If you've hurt me
I haven't shown it
Time's too tight to fight
And we're never face to face
Style is timeless and fashion's only now
We've got the ways no one needs to show us how ---
