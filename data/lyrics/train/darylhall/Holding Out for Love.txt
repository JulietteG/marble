Why does that restless part of me always see
Did I know love wouId show
And Id find the passion I need
Look up ahead
All I see are worlds apart
Broken hearts
Looking for something more
Some magic they might feel

That's why l hold on
I'm holding out for love
There's only one Im dreaming of
That's why l hold on
I'm hoIding out for love
Will that one heart wait for me

You know we take those twists and turns
Never learn
Goin' on
Takes so long to find all the passion we need
Look what we have
Dont wanna be two worlds apart
Loving hearts stay live
Strong survive
Just matters what we both feel

That's why l hold on
I'm holding out for love
There's only one Im dreaming of
That's why l hold on
I'm hoIding out for love
Will that one heart wait for me

I watch the time go by
I swear now baby
I have never been so sure in my heart
So close to my dreams

That's why l hold on
I'm holding out for love
There's only one Im dreaming of
That's why l hold on
I'm hoIding out for love
Will that one heart wait for me---
