Tell me what world you're living in
I'm trying so hard to understand
Searching my soul just so find any line
That connects me to whatever you are hiding
Remember how we used to be
We shared the best baby, the best of everything
Now it seems like we're slowly drifting apart
Tell me when did we stop communicating
Heart to heart

What's in you world
What'cha trying to hide from me
I can't fight what I can't see
I need so know what's going on
What's in your world
I'm standing here with a broken heart
Trying to stop before l start
Falling all over again
Baby I need to know
Need for you to show
What's in your world

Girl, l'm not ready to walk away from you
Unless you say that it's over and done, I know
I'II do what I gotta do
lt's time to remind you that love's on the line
So baby say what you gotta say
But if you're gonna walk away (tell me)

What's in you world
What'cha trying to hide from me
I can't fight what I can't see
I need so know what's going on
What's in your world
I'm standing here with a broken heart
Trying to stop before l start
Falling all over again
Baby I need to know
Need for you to show
What's in your world

What's in you world
What'cha trying to hide from me
I can't fight what I can't see
I need so know what's going on
What's in your world
I'm standing here with a broken heart
Trying to stop before l start
Falling all over again
Baby I need to know
Need for you to show
What's in your world

What's in you world
What'cha trying to hide from me
I can't fight what I can't see
I need so know what's going on
What's in your world
I'm standing here with a broken heart
Trying to stop before l start
Falling all over again
Baby I need to know
Need for you to show
What's in your world---
