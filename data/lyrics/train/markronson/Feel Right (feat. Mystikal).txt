Ladies and gentleman give it up for Mystikal!

Calling all cars in here for the Prince of the South
Kill that yabba dabba doo shhh... I just got out!
Still rapping slapping kittens and grabbing my crotch
I'm the artist the godfather still hard as a rock!

You gon' mess around and make me knock ya fruit juice loose
Ya banana, ya watermelon and pomegranate too!
Rhyming kung fu that split bamboo
Crowd rocking ain't no stopping that rapping ass fool!
I been bad bruh whatcha getting mad for?
I'm a have to light you up
I eat flames up
And crap fire out!
Don't make me light my butt!

Excuse me, who me?
I got a lot of groupies
I aught have a freakin doghouse like Snoopy!
Curtains go up!
It's going down!
Tear that thing out the frame like my band
Ow!

C'mon!

Grabbing on my pants she trying to pull it out my pocket
Don't yank on it so hard you going to pull it out the sockit!
It's exercise with thighs and hip muscles
Next exercise we gon' burn some lip muscles
Let the music work ya ear muscles
And if you skinny then use ya lil muscles
Bag back or tea bag with these duffles!
Pow pow get smash when we hustle!
When the last time you had a knuckle sandwich? Huh?
When the last time somebody had they foot so far up your ass you couldn't handle it?
You can't stand it!
To make matters worse you gotta go to the studio with Bruno Mars on another planet!
Don't get mad I'm just sayin
Don't believe it cuz I'm saying it
Believe it cuz I'm tellin ya!
I'm doing the rapping and bussing
Ronson on the scratching and cutting!

Give it to 'em on the one!

Uhhh!
This the intermission
Break it down so the people listen
Take a second to wipe my sweat
Might be the only chance you get to catch your breath
Don't get too comfortable in here
Better believe I'm bringing back the rumble in here
Just when you thought you could cool down and sip some of that water
shhh...
I'm back
Say it again!

Ladies and gentlemen one more time
