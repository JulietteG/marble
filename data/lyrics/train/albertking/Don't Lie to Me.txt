There's two kind of people
I just can't stand
Evil-hearted woman
And a lyin' man

Don't you lie to me
Now don't you lie to me
Because it makes me mad
Evil as a man can be

When you told me
That you loved me long time ago
The fellow that you got
You don't want him no more

Don't you lie to me
Now don't you lie to me
Because it makes me mad
I get evil as a man can be

You told me
That you loved me long time ago
The fellow that you have
You don't want him no more

Don't you lie to me
Now don't you lie to me
Because it makes me mad
I get evil as a man can be

Don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me
No, don't lie to me
Now don't you lie to me
Because it makes me mad
I get evil as a man can be---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
