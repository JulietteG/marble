Somebody let me down
Somebody show me love
I wouldn't care much either way

I'd rather the sticks and stones
Than dragging the ball and chain
Of what if the world won't take me

Even if the hole should crack
Even if the blood flows red
Nothing could be worse than numb
So please, use me up

I just want anyone
To use me up
'Cause no one ever does
Use me up

I've carried it all too long
The fear of the pain it brings
Feeling the panic building up

I'd rather the broken heart
Than live in the emptiness
Of what if the world won't save me

Even if the bow should break
Even if the blood runs cold
Nothing could be worse than numb
Please, use me up

I just want anyone
To use me up
'Cause no one ever does
Use me up
Use me up

Treat me somewhere cruel
You can throw me away
As long as I feel it
Show me something real
You can't deceive me
I am yours to use

Use me up [x3]
