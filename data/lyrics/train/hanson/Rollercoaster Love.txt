I think Im losing my grip
I think Im losing control
Youre creeping under my skin
Youre getting into my soul
You give me love I can touch
But its the criminal kind
Sometimes it can be too much
I really need your roller coaster love
You take me up and down
And send me for a twist
You lift me off the ground
Your roller coaster love
You take me fast and slow
And send me for a tryst
Well now I want some more of
Your roller coaster
Your roller coaster
Youve got me down on my knees
Youre gonna be my demise
The way you trick and you tease
It should come as no surprise
I feel the temperature change
I feel the heat on the rise
I want to go for a ride
I really need your roller coaster love
You take me up and down
And send me for a twist
You lift me off the ground
Your roller coaster love
You take me fast and slow
And send me for a tryst
Well now I want some more of
Your roller coaster
Your roller coaster
I feel the temperature change
I feel the heat on the rise
I wanna go for a ride
I really need your roller coaster love
Your roller coaster love
Your roller coaster
Your roller coaster
Your roller---Lyrics submitted by Grant Taplin.
