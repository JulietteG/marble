True love is a precious thing
Few will ever find it or keep it
My heart is an open book
For you to believe in
Sell me out, sail me down the river
But always keep me at your side
Love me, hate me, all the same
I dont care what it takes
I will keep you warm at night
I wanna go on and on with you
I dont care where to, if Im there with you
I wanna go on and on its true
Id give all this up if it means your love
Real love shows you everything
Teaching even sorrow and weeping
I have but one life to give
Here yours for the taking
Sell me out, sail me down the river
But always keep me at your side
Love me, hate me, all the same
I dont care what it takes
I will keep you warm at night
I wanna go on and on with you
I dont care where to, if Im there with you
I wanna go on and on its true
Id give all this up if it means your love
I will love you all my life
And even til the end of time
If you will just be mine, all mine
I do believe Ill make your dreams come true
I wanna go on and on with you
I dont care where to, if Im there with you
I wanna go on and on its true
Id give all this up if it means your love
Every hair, every part
Every stop, every start
I cant quit you---Lyrics submitted by Grant Taplin.
