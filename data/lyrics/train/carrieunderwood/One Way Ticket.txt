If youre tired of your life and the way that you feel
Like a fish on a hook,
Like a bug on a dirty windshield, its ok
Its time to take your chips and cash them all in
Cause it matters where youre going
Not where you been, say hey
Goodbye yesterday
Well if life dont go your way
Maybe its time to take a break,
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, just kick it
We got a one way ticket
Sunshine and bright and its meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it
We got a one way ticket

So pack up your smile and your new flip flops
Were headed to a heaven where the beach dont stop
Dance the day and the night away
Grab yourself a gal,
Grab yourself a fella,
Grab yourself a drink with a pink umbrella
Goodbye yesterday
Well if life dont go your way
Maybe its time to take a nice long break

[Chorus:]
Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, woo, just kick it
We got a one way ticket
Sunshine and bright and its meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it, eh
We got a one way ticket

[Outro:]
Ou la la la la la
Raise your hands in the air tonight
Raise your hands in the air tonight
Push that clock and call it a day
Say adios to the minimum wage
Tell your boss man where he can stick it
We got a one way ticket
Life is so good, its sticky sweet
Its a carnival cotton candy treat
All wrapped in a lollipop, lick it
We got a one way ticket ---
