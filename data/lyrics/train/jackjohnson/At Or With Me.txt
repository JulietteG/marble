Are they laughing at or with me
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes 
I think that I'm so happy now 
And I think this is a bitter you

            (chorus)
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh
Are they laughing at or with me
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh
Why can't we just say what we mean

People are just trying to fit in
But is there something tellin you
You can't trust anyone in this town
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes

               (chorus)

Don't put your money where your mouth is, baby
We don't wanna see you choke
Nobody's choking around here anymore
Nobody's broken any high score
No dancing shoes will touch these dusty floors
For such a long, long time
For such a long, long time
For such a long time 

             (chorus)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh [x4]---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Parry.
