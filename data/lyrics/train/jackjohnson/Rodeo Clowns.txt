Sweeping the floors
Open up the doors
Yeah, turn on the lights
Getting ready for the night
Nobody's romancing
'Cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music.

Bright lights flashing they cover up you 
Like a so many people so many problems so many reasons
To buy another round drink it down just another night on the town
With the big man money man better than the other man
He got the plan with the million-dollar give a damn
When nobody understand he'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashing
And the women keep on dancing with the clowns yeah yeah yeah
Pick me up when I'm down yeah yeah
Rodeo clowns yeah yeah yeah
Pick me up when I'm down yeah yeah

The disco ball spinning all the music and the women
And the shots and tequila man they say that they need ya
What they really need
Is just a little room to breathe
A teeny boppin disco queen
She barely understands and dreams of belly button rings
And other kinds of things
Symbolic of change
But the thing that is strange is that the changes occur
And now she's just a part of the herd yeah yeah yeah
Man I thought that you heard yeah yeah
The changes occurred yeah yeah yeah
She's just a part of the herd yeah yeah

Lights out shut down late night wet ground
You walk by look at him but he can't look at you yeah
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground because
You understand booze but he only knows let down
By the corner there's another one
Reaching out a hand coming from a broken man
Well, you try to live but he's done tryin
Not dead but definitely dyin' 
With the rest of the clowns yeah yeah
Rest of the clowns yeah yeah

Sweeping the floors
Open up the doors
Yeah, turn on the lights
Getting ready for the night
Nobody's romancing
'Cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music.---Lyrics submitted by matt.
