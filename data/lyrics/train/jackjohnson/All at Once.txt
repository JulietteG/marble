All at once,
the world can overwhelm me
theres almost nothin' that you could tell me,
that could ease my mind
Which way will you run?
when its always all around you
and the feeling lost and found you again,
a feeling that you have no control of.
Around the sun some say,
its gonna be the new hell, some say
its still too early to tell, some say
it really aint no myth at all

Keep asking ourselves, are we really,
strong enough?
theres so many things that we got,
too proud of,
too proud of,
too proud of

I wanna take the preconcieved down from underneath your feet,
we could, shake it off and instead we'll plant some seeds,
We'll watch them as they grow and with each new beat, 
from your heart the roots grow deeper,
the branches will they reach for what?

Nobody really knows
But underneath it all theres this heart all alone
But what about when its gone?
It really wont be so long,
sometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singin' from at all

Theres a world we've never seen,
theres still hope between the dreams,
the weight of it all could blow with a breeze.
But if your waitin' on the wind, dont forget to breath
'cos as the darkness gets deeper, we're sinkin' so we reach for love

At least something we can hold,
But I'll reach to you from where time just cant go.
But what about whens its gone?
It really wont be so long,
sometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singin' from at all.---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
