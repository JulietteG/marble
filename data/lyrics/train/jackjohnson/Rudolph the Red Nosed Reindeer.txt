Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (yippee)
"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history."
Well Rudolph he didn't go for that
He said "I see through your silly games"
How could you look me in the face
When only yesterday you called me names?
Well all of the other reindeers man,
Well they sure did feel ashamed,
"Rudolph you know we're sorry,
We're truly gonna try to change"---
