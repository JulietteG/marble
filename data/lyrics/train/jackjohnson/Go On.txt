In my rear view
I watch you
Watching the twilight
Behind the telephone line
With nothing to prove, or to assume
Just thinking that your thoughts are different than mine
In my rear view
I watch you
I gave you your life, which you gave me mine
I see you slowly swim away
As the light is leaving town
To a place that I cant be
Theres no apologies

Chorus:
(Just go on
Just go on
Theres still so many things I want to say to you
But go on
Just go on
Were bound by blood this moment
And the moment that we stop
The moment that we stop)

I see the perfect little lies
Watch the shadows of the clouds
And the surface of the ocean
Out the window of a plane
I get nervous when I fly
Im used to walking with my feet
Turbulence is like a sigh that I cant help over think
What is the purpose of my life
If it doesnt ever do with learning to let it go
Live life curiously
Ooh you could do the same
Its the least you could do
Cause its a lonely little train
But you dont have to

Chorus:
(So go on
Just go on
Theres still so many things I want to say to you
Go on
Just go on
Were bound by blood and love
And the moment that we stop)

Repeat:
(Just go on
Just go on
Theres still so many things I want to say to you
Just go on
Just go on
Were bound by blood this moment
And the moment that we stop
The moment that we stop)---Lyrics submitted by Chanel.
