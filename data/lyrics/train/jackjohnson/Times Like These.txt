In times like these
In times like those
What will be will be
and so it goes..

And it always goes 
on and on and on and on and on
on and on and on and on and on it goes
mm hmmm hmmm 
mmm hmmm hmmm
mm hmmm hmmm

And there's always been laughin' cryin' birth and dyin'
Boys and Girls with hearts that take and give and break
an Healin' growin' recreatin' and raise and nurture
But then hurt from times to times like these
And times like those 
What will be will be
and so it goes

And there will always be stop and go and fast and slow 
An' action, reaction an sticks an stones
Those for peace an those for war
An God bless these ones not those ones
But these ones 

In times like these
In times like those
What will be will be
and so it goes..

And it always goes 
on and on and on and on and on
on and on and on and on and on it goes
mm hmmm hmmm 
mmm hmmm hmmm
mm hmmm hmmm

Somehow I know
It won't be the same
Somehow I know
Never be the same---Lyrics submitted by Amber Ludlow.
