All my bags are packed
I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside your door
hate to wake you up to say good bye,
But the dawn is breaking it's early morn'
Taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
already I'm so lonesome I could cry 

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go 
I'm leaving on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again 
oh,  babe I hate to go 

There's so many times I've let you down 
So many times I've played around 
I tell you now they don't mean a thing 
Every place I go I think of you 
Every song I sing I sing for you 
When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me 
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane,
I don't know when I'll be back again
oh, babe I hate to go 
Now the time has come to leave you 
one more time let me kiss you
then close your eyes I'll be on my way

Dream of the days to come 
When I won't have to leave alone
About the time I won't have to say
Kiss me and smile for me 
Tell me that You'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go 
I'm leavin' on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again 

leavin' on a jet plane
don't know when I'll be back again
leavin' on a jet plane
don't know when I'll be back again 
Oh, babe I hate to go---Lyrics submitted by Alisha.
