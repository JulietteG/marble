A gentleman is so 1995, so hard for a girl to find
A real husband is so 1999, so hard for a girl to find (What)
Cause most guys just hit it and quit it
And then they wonder why most girls just spit it
A gentleman is so 1995, so hard for a girl to find

You're not a lady if you're always on your knees
Shouldn't have to beg a gentleman, so please be gentle, please
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, I hope you know
He over-compensates by buying you fancy cars
Just to cover up the fact that he stays out all night in bars
If you can't see, then maybe he's not meant to be

A gentleman is so 1995, so hard for a girl to find
A real husband is so 1999, so hard for a girl to find (What)
Cause most dudes just hit it and quit it
And then they wonder why most girls just spit it
A gentleman is so 1995, so hard for a girl to find

You had his baby, so you might got him for now
He already had the milk, so why would he go buy the cow?
Hop in, your chance is slim especially when I'm lying next to him

I wouldn't marry him, no, not if I were you
Cause if he's been cheating on me, then he'll probably cheat on you
Hop in, your chance is slim, especially when, he's lying next to them

A gentleman is so 1995, so hard for a girl to find
A real husband is so 1999, so hard for a girl to find, what
Cause most dudes just hit it and quit it
And then they wonder why most girls just spit it
A gentleman is so 1995, so hard for a girl to find

Don't get me long, I know that
Most girls ain't perfect angels
I'll let you taste my rainbow
You could at least be faithful

A gentleman, with a 9 to 5
A real husband so 1999
A gentleman, with a 9 to 5
A real husband so 1999

A gentleman is so 1995, so hard for a girl to find
A real husband is so 1999, so hard for a girl to find (What)
Cause most dudes just hit it and quit it
And then they wonder why most girls just spit it
A gentleman is so 1995, so hard for a girl to find

I need a Ryan Gosling, I need a Robert Pattinson
Somebody I can take to Mama, I need to find my Obama
I need a Jonas Brother and, how about a Denzel Washington?
I need a Kellen Lutz, and a Channing Tatum, throw 'em my way, I'll date 'em
I need a Drake, I need a Ludacris, I need a Wheezy, I don't care who he is
Heard 'em say I need a Kanye, he ain't a gentleman, but I'll have him anyway
George Clooney, Lamar Odom, Larry King, I like 'em older
All the gentleman from all around the world, holla at me, holla at me, let me be your girl

A gentleman, 9 to 5
A real husband 1999
A gentleman, 9 to 5
A real husband 1999

Go go 90s, go go 90s
Go go 90s, go go 90s
So 1999!
1999
99
So 1999---Lyrics submitted by Courtney.
