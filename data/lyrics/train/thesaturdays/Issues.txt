sometimes i feel like im goin outta my mind 
boy the way you do me is a damn crime
then you smile at me and its alright......with you there aint no in between 
every time that i walk out the door tell myself i wont take it no more
theres a part of me wont let ya go keep sayin yh but my heart sayin no

me and my heart we got issues, dont know if i should hate you or miss you
damm i wish that i could resist you carnt decide if i should slap you or kiss you
me and my heart we got issues issuess ...
we got issues

its so hard boy you leave me hangin for so long 
you empty out my love till its all gone
you change the words but still its the same song
im tired of the melody

change my number and thorw out your clothes
but my feelings for you, it still shows
i keep building the walls round my heart
but then i see you and it all falls apart

me and my heart we got issues, dont know if i shoud hate you or miss you
damn i wish that i could resist you, cant decide if i should slap you or kiss 
you
me and my heart we got issues issues issues
we got issues issues issues

why fight it, cant hide it, truth is i think i like it
confussion, illusion, still i dont know which way to go

me and my heart we got issues dont know if i should hate you or miss you
damn i wish that i could resist you, cant decide if i should slap you or kiss
you
me and my heart we got issues dont know if i should hate you or miss you
damn i wish that i could resist you, cant decide if i should slap you or kiss
you
me and my heart we got issues issues issues
we got issues issues issues, we got issues issues issues, we got issues issues issues---Lyrics submitted by aiesha.
