I gave you all you desired, 
All that you needed, boy I provided.
I let you into my head, 
Into my bed, and that's a privilage.

I had your back in the answers.
You took the dollars,
I took the chances.
Defended battled and fought, 
'Cos I really thought you loved me.

I dont know where to start or where to stop, (No)
But I know I am done Ive had enough.

So fall, out of my head, out of my heart,
And when you hit the ground.
Youll be sorry that Im not around,
I will watch you while you
Fall out of your mind, out of your fantasy
When you hit the wall.
Think of me,
Ill be on the top just watching you fall.

You said that you were the strong one,
I was the girl and I was the young one.
I kept your feet on the ground,
My head in the rounds, I had you.

You told me you were so grateful,
I was with you and I was so faithful.
I stood by in all that you said,
And all that you dared, I loved you.

I dont know how to act or what to say.
But I know I am good. Ill be OK,
And you,

Fall, out of my hands, out of my heart,
And when you hit the ground,
Youll be sorry that Im not around,
I will watch you while you,
Fall out of your mind, out of your fantasy,
When you hit the wall. 
Think of me,
Ill be on the top just watching you fall.

Ill be on the top, just watching you fall.

Fall, fall, fall, fall

Haaa

Fall, fall

I want you to fall..........

Fall out of my head, out of my heart,
And when you hit the ground,
Youll be sorry that Im not around,
I will watch you while you, 
Fall out of your mind, out of your fantasy
When you hit the wall. 
Think of me,
Think of me yeah,
Ill be on the top, just watching you 

[Fall,Fall,Fall]
Fall, out of my head, out of my heart 
And when you hit the ground
Youll be sorry that Im not around,
I will watch you 
[Fall,Fall,Fall]
Fall out of your mind, out of your fantasy
When you hit the wall, think of me,

Ill be on the top, just watching you fall.---Lyrics submitted by Chrissy.
