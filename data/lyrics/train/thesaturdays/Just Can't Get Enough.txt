When I'm with you baby, I go outta my head,
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,
All the things you do to me, And everything you said,
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,
We slip and slide as we fall in love,
And i just can't seem to get enough, No,

We were together, we're walking down the street, 
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you, I know we have to meet, 
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
It's getter hotter, it's a burnin love, 
And I just can't seem to get enough no! 

Yeah, yeah
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough x9

And when it rains, your shinin down to me, 
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow, you know you set me free, 
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

You're like an angel and you give me your love, 
And I just can't seem to get enough oh! 

Oh, oh, I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough x2
I can't get enough, 
I just can't get enough x9---Lyrics submitted by JAYGRIO.
