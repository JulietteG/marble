(feat. Sean Paul)

Oh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating
Oh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating

Boy it's now or never
Time we get together
Been a long time coming, now I need that loving
I like the way you tease me
But let's just make this easy
Put me in control
We can switch roles

And I take the lead
You're so far behind me
You know what I need
I'm not gonna stop

Whatever the weather
We gon' be better together
So what's up baby?
What about us?

'Cos I've been watchin' and waitin'
Why don't you give it or take it?
So what's up baby?
What about us?

Watcha doin' to my head? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Should be here with me instead! (Na, na, na, na, na, na)
What about those words you said? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)
What about us?
(What about us?)

Oh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating
Oh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating

I love to hear you whisper
Take it take it lower
Don't be 'fraid to show her, what you freakin' do
Cause we can do it nightly
You get me excited
Now it's my turn (yes it's my turn)

So give it to me, why are we waiting?
I know what you need
And I'm not gonna stop

Whatever the weather
We gon' be better together
So what's up baby?
What about us?

'Cos I've been watchin' and waitin'
Why don't you give it or take it?
So what's up baby?
What about us?

Watcha doin' to my head? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Should be here with me instead! (Na, na, na, na, na, na)
What about those words you said? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)
What about us?
(What about us?)

[Dance break]

Watcha doin' to my head? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Should be here with me instead! (Na, na, na, na, na, na)
What about those words you said? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)
What about us?
(What about us?)

Let me take the lead
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
You know what I need
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Put my mind at ease
And Tell me what about us
What about us ---
