V1
We used to go together
Lookin after each other
I thought that you were better
Look at you, Look at you, Look at you ,Look at you

You used to be so layed back
You always kept it so cool
I loved you cuz of all that
That's the truth
That's the truth 
That's the truth
That's the truth

I don't think you know where your head is
I was always there to help you break the fall

(chorous)
And now you wanna pretend that your a superstar
And now you want us to end what's taken you this far
Don't tell me that you're done as far as we go
You need to have a sit down with you ego ego
When everyone's gone and you are by your self
You know that you're gonna come to me for help
Don't tell me that it's time for goin solo
You need to knock some sense into your ego ego ego ego

V2
You act like you're on fire
Livin your delusion
You just need you to take you higher
Off you go, off you go, off you go, off you go

You can take the call when your ready
I will not be there to help you break the fall

(chorus)
And now you wanna pretend that you're a superstar
And now you want us to end what's taken you this far
Don't tell me that you're done as far as we go
You need to have a sit down with your ego 
When everyone's gone and you are by your self
You know that you're gonna come to me for help
Don't tell me that it's time for goin solo
You need to knock some sense into your ego ego ego

V3
And when it's time for you to come back down to
Where you started
But we parted
You'll find that it is very hard 
To face
Reality
It's the simple thing

(chorous)
