Don't hold back
 It's nice to see somebody make an effort
 You know I like it in the street lights
 Like, like, like the spotlight
 Do you like me?

I la-la-love this track
 So if you wanna come with me you should know
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like this beat, yes
 Crazy and infectious
 I'm a give my business
 Boy my resume says "I'm a bad girl"

[Chorus]

Closer baby look in my eyes
 Do you recognize me?
 I've been a bad girl
 I'm a bad girl, I'm notorious

I'm a outlaw
 I'm the big boss
 I'm a ganster
 On the dancefloor

I'm a outlaw
 I'm the big boss
 I'm a ganster
 On the dancefloor

[Verse 2]

Boy beware
 I got a record and I'm known for my style
 And everybody knows my name here
 I'm the head of game here
 Pleasure and the pain, yeah
 Because my resume says "I'm a bad girl"

[Chorus]


 Closer baby look in my eyes
 Do you recognize me?
 I've been a bad girl
 I'm a bad girl, I'm notorious

I'm a outlaw
 I'm the big boss
 I'm a ganster
 On the dancefloor

I'm a outlaw
 I'm the big boss
 I'm a ganster
 On the dancefloor

[Bridge]

Baby tell me can you get it from my energy
 I've been a bad girl
 I'm a bad girl, I'm notorious

I'm a outlaw
 I'm the big boss
 I'm a ganster
 On the dancefloor

[Chorus]

Closer baby look in my eyes
 Do you recognize me?
 I've been a bad girl
 I'm a bad girl, I'm notorious

I'm a outlaw
 I'm the big boss
 I'm a ganster
 On the dancefloor

I'm a outlaw
 I'm the big boss
 I'm a ganster
 On the dancefloor---Lyrics submitted by huz.
