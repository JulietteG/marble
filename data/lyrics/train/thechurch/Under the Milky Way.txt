Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty
Sound of their breath fades with the light
I think about the loveless fascination
Under the milky way tonight

Lower the curtain down in Memphis
Lower the curtain down all right
I got no time for private consultation
Under the milky way tonight

I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find

And it's something quite peculiar
Something that shimmering and white
Leads you here despite your destination
Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight

I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find
I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find

Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight

I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find
I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find
(Milky way tonight)

Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight---
