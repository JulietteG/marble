She only smiles, 
He only tells her, 
That shes the flowers the wind and spring, 
In all her splender sweetly surrendering
The love that innocence brings.

Almaz, pure and simple, 
Born in a world where love survives. 
Now men will want her, 
Cause life dont haunt her, 
Almaz you lucky lucky thing.

Now I watch closely 
And I watch wholly, 
I cant imagine love so rare. 
Shes young and tender, 
But will life bend her, 
I look around is she every where?

Almaz, pure and simple, 
Born in a world where love survives. 
Now men will want her, 
Cause life dont haunt her, 
Almaz you lucky lucky thing. 

He throws her kisses, 
She shares his wishes, 
Im sure hes king with out a doubt. 
With love so captive, 
So sorely captive, 
Id ask if I could play the part. 

Almaz, pure and simple, 
Born in a world where love survives. 
Now men will want her, 
Cause life dont haunt her, 
Almaz, you lucky lucky thing. 
Almaz, you lucky lucky thing. 
Almaz, you lucky lucky thing.---Lyrics submitted by That.
