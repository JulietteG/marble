Coming in from Colorado takin' a late night chick out of the snow
Need to see your face tomorrow just an hour or two before you go
Hangin' around for days and nights I come around to see your point of view
I can see through all the glitter and marbles that's the reason I'm coming home to you

I'm leaving town so you better take hold
I'm stepping out from the river of old
Everybody's hustling for a place on the screen 
But I'll hang around and I'll share your dream - that's right

Say time always runs like a river, tell me then kindly how come I ain't got no time
Risks and Illusions tell me to hold on, hey brother can you spare a dime

I'm hangin' around wherever you go
I'm headed down to the river of old
I'm tryin' to step out of this scene
I'd like to step into your dream

I know exactly what you mean
I know the secrets you dream

Every street I walk alone
Every girl upon a throne
Every bloodhand full of gold
Just tryin' to reach down into your soul
~I know the secrets that you need~

Hangin' around with saints and sinners, losers, winners I try to pay no mind
I can see through all that shakes and quivers, everybody's soul strung out on a line
There's a girl alight in the sky tonight with ten thousand soldiers staring at feet of clay
Secrets to be told will keep for the night and we will soon be on our way

I'm leaving town so take a good hold
Carrying it back to the rivers of old
It's a blood red curse that'll set you free
Standin' in the snow waiting on a dream
I know the secrets that you need
You know exactly what I mean
I know the secrets that you dream
You're upside down and painted green
I know the secrets that you need
I --- (???)---Lyrics submitted by Scott Wohlers.
