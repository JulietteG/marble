There's a penny on the floor and your gone
The television's on
Have you found another man to take my place?
There's a penny on the floor and I'm wise
I try to see in your eyes
But all I see is the reflection of my face

There's a penny on the floor and your gone
I'm trying to right what's wrong
A stronger man might do it with more grace
There's a penny on the floor and I'm wise
I look up to the skies
I cry and pray and stare out into space

There's a penny on the floor and your standing at the door
Turn around and say goodbye
A woman like you comes around just once a life

There's a penny on the floor and I'm strong
I'll try to carry on
I realize that no one can take your place
There's a penny on the floor and I'm fine
I know it's gonna take some time
Before I look at you without looking at my own face

A penny on the floor
I'm tired of the war
A penny on the track
Are you coming back?

There's a penny on the floor and it stays
As a tribute to the days
That we spent with you 
No one can take them away
There's a penny on the floor and it stays
As a trubute to the ways
That you filled my soul with courage hope and grace

There's a penny on the floor and you're standing at the door
Turn around and say goodbye
A woman like you comes around just once a life 
There's a penny on the floor and you're standing at the door
Turn around and say goodbye
If a woman like you comes around
It won't bring me down---Lyrics submitted by lynn.
