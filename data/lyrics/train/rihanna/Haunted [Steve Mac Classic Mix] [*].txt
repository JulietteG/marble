(Whoo..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh)

Footsteps on the stairs, they aren't really there,
Feel like there's someone watchin' me,
Shadows on the wall footsteps down the hall,
But when I look there's nothin' to see,

You said that you let her go, 
Turned the page and closed the door,
I can't get inside your head,
'Cause when I try, she's there instead,

(Hook/Chorus)
I can't compete with a memory,
How can I fight with someone that I can't see,
There's two of us, but it feels like three,
I wish her ghost would just let us be,
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted,
But I gotta let you go cause this love is, Haunted, Haunted

(Whoo..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh)

(Verse:2)
You say that she's gone, that you moved on,
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain,
Won't you please tell her set you free,

Sometimes when you look past me,
Your eyes see someone I can't see,
So I'm givin' up this war,
Cause I can't fight it anymore,

(Hook/Chorus)
I can't compete with a memory,
How can I fight with someone that I can't see,
There's two of us, but it feels like three,
I wish her ghost would just let us be,
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted,
But I gotta let you go cause this love is, Haunted, Haunted

(Whoo..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh)

(Bridge)

Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave, Oh no,
The walls are closing in it's so damn hard to breathe,

Spoken: And ain't nothin' I could do about it...

(Yeah, eh, ah! Ooh..ooh..oh)

(Hook/Chorus)
I can't compete with a memory,
How can I fight with someone that I can't see,
There's two of us, but it feels like three,
I wish her ghost would just let us be,
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted,
But I gotta let you go cause this love is, Haunted, (Haunted) Haunted, 

(Whoo..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh)

Haunted, Haunted,
I don't wanna fight anymore, someone's walking out that door,

Haunted, Haunted,
(Whoo..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh..ooh)
