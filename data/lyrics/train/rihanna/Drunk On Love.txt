I feel like Im a hopeless romantic
I cant help fallin in love
I fiene for love 
I want it I crave it 
I just cant get enough

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I maybe a little naive
Yeah 

(chorus)
You know Im drunk on love
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
Its all that I need
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Ive been let down
But never been tainted 
So I stay thirsty for more
No I wont hold back
No drop is wasted
I let love run its coarse

Take me away 
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead 
I maybe a little naive
Yeah

(CHORUS)

You Know that Im drunk on love
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up 
You know Im 
Drunk on love 
Drunk drunk on love 
Nothing can sober me up 
Its all that I need


Im so intoxicated
I love the way you taste
On my lips 
When we kiss
You got me so additicted
So much I cant resist 
Fallng into your arms

Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve 
Always let love take the lead
I maybe a little naive
Yeah

(chorus)

You that Im drunk on love
Drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know Im drunk
Drunk Drunk on love
Nothing cane sober me up
Its all that I need 
Its all that I need 
Its all that I need---Lyrics submitted by Marie Williams.
