911, it's a critical emergency, yea
Better run run run,
Come and charge him with the 143, yea yea
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now he's done done done and his love is no more for me
hand in the air as he wave me goodbye
He said he care but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga is you blind

Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah yeah yeah
Boy, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Fe fo fum like the sky is falling down on me
Numb numb numb, he's so cold he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Gwan and put 'im away
He's the only one one one I ever let get the best of me

hand in the air as he wave me goodbye
He said he care but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga is you blind

Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah yeah yeah
Boy, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?

No love, no love, no love allowed

Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed---Lyrics submitted by Mommy Katie.
