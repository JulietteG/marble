[Hook]
So give it to me like I want it
This is for your, eyes only
Rock me out, back and forth
Rock me out, on the floor

Give it to me like I need it
You know how to make me feel it
Rock me out, more and more
Rock me out, on the floor yeah

[Rihanna]
Come over boy im so ready
You're taking too long to get my head on the ground
And my feet in the clouds, oh oh

I'm so clean feeling dirty
Come right now, you better hurry
Before you miss out, and i finish it off, oh yeah

I've been a bad girl daddy
Won't you come get me

[Hook]
So give to me like I want it
This for, your eyes only
Rock me out, back and forth
Rock me out, on the floor

Give it to me like I need it
You know how to make me feel it
Rock me out, more and more
Rock me out, on the floor

[Rihanna]
Keep it up for me, you can do it
Put your hands on me, watch me lose it
Boy blew it out, like its the only way out

I'll show you my dirty secrets
Real hush you baby, don't just speak
Whatever we do, it's between me and you

I've been a bad girl daddy
Won't you come get me

[Hook]
So give it to me like I want it
This is for your, eyes only
Rock me out, back and forth
Rock me out, on the floor

Give it to me like I need it
You know how to make me feel it
Roc me out, more and more
Roc me out, on the floor yeah

[Bridge]
It's gonna be different tonight
The best time of your life
I just want you to know baby
Take a peek at the girl I hide
I'll let you in on a dirty secret
I just wanna be loved

[Hook]
So give it to me like I want it
This is for your, eyes only
Rock me out, back and forth
Rock me out, on the floor

Give it to me like I need it
You know how to make me feel it
Rock me out, more and more
Rock me out, on the floor yeah---Lyrics submitted by kaha.
