I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cos I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships dont get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they loved me truly
But at the time it didnt mean a thing

My mind is gone
Im spinning round
And deep inside
My tears ill drown
Im loosing grip
Whats happening?
I stray from love
This is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now Im in this condition
And I got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what
Youll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
Cos its hurting me to let it go
Maybe cos we spent so much time
And I know that is no more
I should have never let you hold me baby
Maybe why im sad to see us apart
I didnt give it to you on purpose
can't figure out how you stole my heart

My mind is gone
Im spinning round
And deep inside
My tears ill drown
Im loosing grip
Whats happening?
I stray from love

This is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now Im in this condition
And I got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what
Youll never see me cry

How did I get here with you
Ill never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do
To stay away from love with you
Im broken-hearted
I cant let you know
And I Wont Let It Show
You wont see me cry

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now Im in this condition
And I got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what
Youll never see me cry

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now Im in this condition
And I got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what
Youll never see me cry

all my life...---Lyrics submitted by maranda.
