It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.

The wait is ova, The wait is ova
The wait is ova, The wait is ova
The wait is ova, The wait is ova
The wait is ova, The wait is ova

I pitch with a grenade...
Swing away if ya feeling brave
There's so much power in my name...
If you pop up and you say it steady
I'm gon do da wave

I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up.

It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.


It's getting crowded over here...
But babe...the wait is ova!
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is ova
Fumble don't you fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait

But together we gon be taking over
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn.

So you don't wanna wait
I hate to hear-That's such a shame
Cause if you play it sideways
Aint no time out in ma game
Dey aready on da way
I know you wanna win
and you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play, but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.

It's getting crowded over here...
But babe...the wait is ova!
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is ova
Fumble don't you fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together we gon'be taking ova

It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.

Baby put the work in like a champion
Look the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else
You're the only way I'll win

Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe you're up...
the time is now
And now the wait is ovaaaaaaa!

The wait is ova, the wait is ova
the wait is ova, the wait is ova 
Just wait your turn
The wait is ova, the wait is ova
the wait is ova, the wait is ova 
Just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here...
But babe the wait is ova!
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is ova
Fumble dont' you fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together we gon be taking ova

It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.

Just wait your turn
The wait is ova, the wait is ova 
the wait is ova, the wait is ova---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
