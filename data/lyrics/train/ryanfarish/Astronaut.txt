(Feat. Dave Moisan)

Verse I
Count down, deep breath, wait til Im ready
Feet close to jumping
But they become heavy on my own
I was all alone, trying my best to get by
But You saved me, and You gave me wings
I think Im ready to fly

Chorus
(You make me feel like) Im an astronaut
My feet lift off of the floor
Seems like I forgot what we need gravity for
We dance like fire across the sky
In blazing power we trot
You make me feel like I could be an astronaut

Verse II
Mission objective:  continued rejection
Waiting for directive, Im not afraid of rejection
If I go leave the earth below, onward into the sky
Youre beside me and remind me that
I was born to fly
