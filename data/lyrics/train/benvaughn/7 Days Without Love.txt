Seven days without love makes one weak
A man can't stand on his own two feet
He can't do his job
He can't get no sleep
Seven days without love makes one weak

The first day it's quiet at home
You're enjoying all your time alone
The second day you're doin' alright
You're goin' out with your friends at night
But the third day well that's something else
You're gettin' tired of being by yourself

Seven days without love makes one weak
A man can't stand on his own two feet
He can't do his job
He can't get no sleep
Seven days without love makes one weak

The fourth day it's the same old thing
Sittin' there waitin' for the phone to ring
The fifth day it's a cryin' shame
You're walkin' in circles calling out her name
And the sixth day well there's no use tryin'
If she don't come back you gonna lose your mind

Seven days without love makes one weak
A man can't stand on his own two feet
He can't do his job
He can't get no sleep
Seven days without love makes one weak

You're a nervous wreck
Ever since she left
Another week goes by
You thing you think you gonna die

Seven days without love
Seven days without love
Seven days without love makes one weak
A man can't stand on his own two feet
He can't do his job
He can't get no sleep
Seven days without love makes one weak

Seven days
Seven days
Seven days...---Lyrics submitted by Philippe.
