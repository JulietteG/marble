Trial waves are gonna swallow your town alive
Terrorists are gonna poison all our skies
Bodies are gonna wash up on the beach 
Hell is gonna bring your parents to their knees

 You escape, I'll stay
 I'm so tired of running away

I wanna stay at home for the end of the world
Falling asleep when They're dropping the bomb
         This is all a dream
       That's what I'll be saying [repeat]

Pack all your bags and lock all your doors behind
Clear out the cities and pray for your little lives
   You've all escaped, I've stayed
  I'm so tired of running away

                  [chorus]

Everything around you is gonna turn into 
the biggest pile of ashes that you could ever imagine

Everything around you is gonna turn into the biggest pile of nothingness
So keep on running, keep on running[repeat]

                   [chorus]

I wanna stay at home(x4)---Lyrics submitted by Michele.
