There's Plenty of Space For Me
 in The Back Of Your Car
I can Move All Your Things Around
Was Standing alone on the side of road 
till i saw Your Headlights catch me

I keep to myself on the ride
trying hard to hide all the dirt that covers me
you only can hide who you are 
if you dont care where you're going anyway

Chorus:
I don't Wanna be who I was back then
I almost lost You again
I don't Wanna see Through the Eyes of a liar
Hold The Door For Me

I set them on on fire back there
They didn't know what hit them
Its Always the ones you never suspect
Don't want to accept what I've become

Chorus: [1x]

don't wanna take the wings of you
just keep on driving
just keep on driving
just tell me what you want me to do
just keep on driving
just keep on driving

[I dont wanna be who i was back then, i almost lost {lost} you]

Chorus: [2x]

Hold the Door for Me.---Lyrics submitted by suzzy.
