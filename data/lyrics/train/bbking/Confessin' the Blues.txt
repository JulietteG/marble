Baby, here I stand before you with my heart in my hand
I want you greet it mama hopin' that you'll understand
Oh baby, mama please don't dog me around
Well, I'd rather love you baby, than anyone else I know in town

Well, because you're so nice and lovely
And you have such pleasant ways
If you take to your home I'll be there the rest of my days
That's the truth mama
Yes, you know I wouldn't lie
Well, if I don't love you baby
I swear I hope I die

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
Yeah baby, don't you want a man like me?
Well, you think only about our future
And forget about your used to be

Well now, this is my confession mama
And I'm thrilled by all your charms
It seems that I'm in heaven when you hold me in your arms
Now baby, you can have me for yourself
Well now, you was meant for me baby
And I don't want nobody else

Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?
Yeah baby, don't you want a man like me?
Well, you think only about our future
And forget about your used to be---
