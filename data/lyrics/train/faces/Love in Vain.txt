Johnson

Well, I followed her to the station, a suitcase in my hand
Yeah, I followed her to the station, a suitcase in my hand
It's hard to tell, it's hard to tell when all your love's in vain.

Easy.

When the train pulled in the station, I looked her in the eye
When the train pulled in the station, I looked her in the eye
I felt so sad, so lonesome, I hung my head and cry.

Oh, my loves in vain.

When the train left the station, it had two lights on behind
When the train left the station, it had two lights on behind
The green light was my baby and oh the blue light, the blue light, the blue light was my blues
And all my loves in vain.

My love's in vain. ---Lyrics submitted by vladimir almuna.
