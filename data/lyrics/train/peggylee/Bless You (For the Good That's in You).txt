Bless you for the good thats in you  Peggy Lee

Ooooh ooooh oooh 
Bless you for the good thats in you, bless you every day
Theres some good in everybody, were just made that way
Good Morning, oh miserable, youre not as bad as you make out 
That frown dont set right get right up and shout
Bless you for the good thats in you, bless you every night
If you shine like a love light beamin youll make out all right 
Now if any old evil comes around today, just turn it right around and chase it away 
Bless you for the good thats in you, bless you every day

You know that life is like an old steam engine, you can either go ahead, or in reverse
Now the road ahead may look pretty rocky, but the road behind is bound to be worse
If you close your eyes you wont see the sunshine if you plug your ears you wont hear a thing
And if you shut your heart youll shut out the feeling and therell never be any reason to sing
Bless you, yeah bless you, yes Bless you, yes bless you 
That frown dont set right get right up and shout
Oh bless you for the good thats in you, bless you every night
If you shine like a love light beamin, youll make out all right
If any old evil comes around today, turn it right around and chase it away
Bless you for the good thats in you, bless you every day
Bless you, mmm bless you, yes bless you
Bless you for the good thats in you, bless you every day---Lyrics submitted by Eclectikat.
