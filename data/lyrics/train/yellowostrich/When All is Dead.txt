When the bridges all fall down
and you think your words are dead sound
I will wait for you
Thats all I will do

When the bears and tigers are chasing
all the streetcar vendors erasing
The fashion stops
The curtain drops

When your boyfriend leaves for the outside
but hes cold the minute the horns cry
I will see you then
when weve reached the end

A mass of black to pierce through
a chance to focus on you
The hunt of one
The journeys done

When all is dead and I am
the only one with legs to stand
Will it be right when were at the end?

And to Adam, Eve was the only
Cause nobody wants to be lonely
So they settled down
and she came around

So if they could do it, its easy
If you have no choice but to love me
Will you settle down?
Will you come around?

When all is dead and I am
the only one with legs to stand
Will it be right when were at the end?---Lyrics submitted by alek gene mcgre.
