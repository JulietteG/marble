Like lullabies you are,
Forever in my mind.
I see you in all,
The pieces in my life.
Though you weren't mine,
You were my first love.

I wanted to go away with you,
And I will leave all my troubles here.
I wanted to run away with you,
And I will bring all my dreams and fears.

Like lullabies you are,
Forever in my mind.
I see you in all,
The pieces in my life.
Though you weren't mine
Like lullabies you are,
Forever in my mind.
I see you in all,
The pieces in my life.
Though you weren't mine

Though you weren't mine,
You were my first love.
You were my first love.

I wanted to start again with you,
And I will leave all my worries here.
I wanted only you.
I know that I fell for you.

Like lullabies you are,
Forever in my mind.
I see you in all,
The pieces in my life.
Though you weren't mine
Like lullabies you are,
Forever in my mind.
I see you in all,
The pieces in my life.
Though you weren't mine,

Though you weren't mine,
You were my first love.
You were my first love.
You were my first love. ---Lyrics submitted by Dalia Smith.
