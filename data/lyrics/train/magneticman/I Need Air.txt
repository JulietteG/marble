Electrify my body
And youre makin me feel
Like Im so electric
Everything you do is makin me
Blow Blow Blow

Dont know what to do about it
Cant see how Id live without it
All I wanna do is just
Know Know Know

You suffocate my mind
And now my atmosphere is crowded
And you being here is makin me
Blow Blow Blow

You penetrate my space
And now Im looking out of place
And youre makin it hard for me
I need air!

(Chorus)

I
Breathe
Air!

(x4)

Kaleidoscope colours that you bring to me
Youre freaking out my energy
Im loosin and youre makin me
Low Low Low

Dont know what to do about it
You and I cant live without it
All I wanna do is just
Go Go Go

You smother my emotions
Now Im drowning in your ocean
And Im runnin and Im feeling like
I dont care

You penetrate my space
And now youre looking out of place
And youre makin it hard for me
I need air!

(Chorus)

I
Breathe
Air!

(x4)

Makin my body so erratic!
Just makin my body so erratic!

Give me air!
I need air!

You penetrate my space
And now youre looking out of place
And youre makin it hard for me
I need air!

(Chorus)

I
Breathe
Air!

(x4)

ya makin me air---Lyrics submitted by holger.
