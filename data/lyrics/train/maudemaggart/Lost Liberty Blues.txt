As you fly away on your holiday,
take a last look at me, 
I'm an innocence,  
public momument, 
called the statue of liberty, 
and I am a slave in the home of the brave and land of the free, 
now once my country friends had a yank romance, 
so they gave me to uncle sam, 
but he treats me so,
that I no longer know what im meant for or who I am, 
hes made a mess of my  chance of success, 
and I'm not worth a damn, 
I've got those lost liberty blues, 
lost liberty blues, 
where a pair of handcuffs on my wrist,  
and pad locks on my shoes, 
can you expect me to be gay, 
or ask me to enthueze. 
while reformers lead em from the battle cry of freedom,
to the lost liberty, 
liberty blues---Lyrics submitted by Brigitte.
