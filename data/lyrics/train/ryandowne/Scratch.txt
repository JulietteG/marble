Down from the mountains where lovers take stones
A woman in black descended alone.
His mouth was parched and felt inflamed
It was no use, he was to blame.

A riddled fate, a feeling strange
A burning ache, and the clouds
As a shroud sent to cover my face.

And when it's all been said and done
And I have paid for what I've done
The earth will roll and then you'll know
That I'm coming from the deep and the down below.

Well I had the power to attract you here
Out of the hollow and into the clear
A tempest's wrath I could not save
To send you to an early grave.

A riddled fate a feeling strange
A burning ache and the clouds
As a shroud sent to cover my face.

And when it's all been said and done
And I have paid for what I've done
The earth will roll and then you'll know
That I'm coming from the streets and the town below.---Lyrics submitted by Cat Knapp.
