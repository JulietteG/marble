(VERSE 1) 
Cock back the hammer, The Takeover has begun 
Were millions strong now all united as one 
We compose the whole globe from the east to the west 
And if seeing is believing, 
Youre looking at the best 

Patiently wait, anticipating the arrival 
Of a crew to lead the whole world through and shine a light 
So we can make it through these dark times and spread a new word 
For now is the moment 
And we will be heard 

(CHORUS) 
WE 
One Youth, One Nation 
WE 
One Generation 
WE 
United like soldiers 
WE ARE THE TAKEOVER 

(VERSE 2) 
Weve been through so many years of tears, sacrifice and pain 
Gave buckets of sweat, drip-dried our last vein 
Watched everything weve ever loved forever say goodbye 
But instead of killing us, 
It brought us to life

We live each day to the fullest now and we choose to make a change 
In return our own existence is what we exchange 
If we have to give up everything to do something great 
We are ready, we are willing, 
Cause this is our fate 

(BRIDGE) 
We are the 
We are the 
We are the 
ON YOUR FEET---Lyrics submitted by A W.
