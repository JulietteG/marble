(VERSE 1)
I'm standing at the edge of space and time
Deciding if my being alive is a crime
And if I jump and sail out into the abyss
How much will I really miss? 

I'm inching closer, closer to my fate
Lacking a backup plan or escape
And I'm just about to finally go and move ahead
When a voice calls out to me
Here's what it said:

(CHORUS)
STAND
Every woman and man
This is a call for all to rise up and stand
STAND
Every woman and man
Raise up your voice and say that I can
STAND
Every woman and man
This is a call for all to rise up and 
All rise up and say
I CAN

(VERSE 2)
Get back up on your feet
Youre much to strong to quit on me
Now dry your eyes and brace your back 
Prepare for warfare 
Here comes the attack

Youre nearly there so dont you stop
Making your very own way to the top
And when you see your victory
Together we will be
Were now free

(BRIDGE)
Everybody now
I CAN!---Lyrics submitted by A W.
