I often wonder in my mind
If Ive made a mistake
Cause your soft spoken spirit
Seems to have had all it can take

Then you look at me and smile
And thats all you have to do
Your eyes tell me everything
And I no longer worry about you

Chorus:
I love to dream about you
And how quite you love to be
Girl your perfect silence
Is perfect to me

I watch you walk into a room
You never have too much to say
I guess its in the way you move
Girl it just carries me away

I may never know why 
Why you happened to me
I may never understand
How you set me free

Chorus

I must have done something right
To get to stare at you everyday
All my hopes, dreams and love
The things you ask for when you pray

You captured all that I am
Mind and body and soul
The way that you do everything
Without even saying a word

I may never know why 
Why you happened to me
I may never understand
How you set me free

Chorus

Yea girl your perfect silence
is perfect to me---Lyrics submitted by Paige.
