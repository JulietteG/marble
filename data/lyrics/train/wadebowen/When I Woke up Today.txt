This morning found me wandering through my mind 
Another hangover hiding from the sunshine 
Put some sunglasses on and stared out the window 
Yeah, was looking for a way to tell the world hello 

Dealing with the pain of trying to make a dream fly 
Taking the good and the bad with a big smile 
Uncertain roads and the thrill of the chase 
Man, I sure felt life's embrace when I woke up today 

I saw a girl at the bus stop crying on her telephone 
And a funeral procession heading down cemetery road
A bride and groom outside the Church of Christ 
Its a cut of the cards, its a roll of the dice 

Dealing with the pain of trying to make a dream fly 
Dealing with the pain of trying to make a dream fly 
Taking the good and the bad with a big smile 
Uncertain roads and the thrill of the chase 
Man, I sure felt life's embrace when I woke up today 

Every day brings another chance for you to take 
And every day brings another choice for you to make

When you wake up the pain of trying to make a dream fly 
Taking the good and the bad with a big smile 
Uncertain roads and the thrill of the chase
But I'd have to say I'm in a pretty good place

Dealing with the pain of trying to make a dream fly 
Taking the good and the bad with a big smile 
Uncertain roads and the thrill of the chase 
Man, I sure felt life's embrace when I woke up today---
