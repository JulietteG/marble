I have been restless, 
I have been reckless
Ive been a strain on my moms heart
Ive been a drunk
Ive been a dreamer
Pulling the strings on this old guitar
Ive found a few answers
Ive still got questions
Kept it together and fallen apart

I got secrets and stories
Old shoebox memories
And choices that Id like to change
Teardrops and laughter
And me chasing after
Years that go as quick as they came

Like a west Texas rain
Like a west Texas rain

Well, Ive been a lover
Ive been a father
Ive been a brother
And Ive been a son
Well, Ive been a preacher
Ive been a sinner
If you can name it
Ive probably been one
Im strong for the struggle
Constantly reaching
Reaching for something that Ive never down

And I got secrets and stories
Old shoebox memories
Choices that Id like to change
I got teardrops and laughter
And me chasing after
Years that go as quick as they came

Like a west Texas rain
Like a west Texas rain

So close your eyes and hold on
Were here and were gone
It goes as quick as it came

Just like a west Texas rain
Just like a west Texas rain
Just like a west Texas rain
Just like a west Texas rain ---
