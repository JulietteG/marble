Bent Or Broken is the family tree.
 Bent or broken is the family tree. 
Each branch a part of a part of me. 
This is my tree, and its a big ol tree. 

Dwarf or a giant, its a family tree. 
Dwarf or giant its a family tree. 
Growing just as tall, as it was meant to be, this is your tree, and its a beautiful tree. 
What a beautiful tree; What a beautiful tree, what a beautiful tree, what a beautiful tree.

Strong or Fragile is the family tree; Strong or Fragile is the family tree.
See how the sun shines through the leaves, this is our tree, and its a beautiful tree.
What a beautiful tree, What a beautiful tree, what a beautiful tree, what a beautiful tree.
What a beautiful tree, What a beautiful tree, what a beautiful tree, what a beautiful tree.

Sure its broken but its a family tree. Sure, its broken, but its a family tree.
I can feel the sap, running through me. This is my tree, and its a beautiful tree.---Lyrics submitted by Sandy.
