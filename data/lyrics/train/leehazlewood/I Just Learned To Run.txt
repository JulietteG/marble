sometimes I think
of all the joy
you must get
when you destroy
who'll pick up all the bodies when you're done?
it won't be me
'cause I just learned to run

who's gonna patch those damaged hearts?
your sick young mind has blown apart
who'll pick up all the bodies when you're done?
it won't be me
'cause I just learned to run

no one's safe from your abuse
you warp their worlds
then turn 'em loose
who'll walk the ghosts of men you've known?
who'll take their hands and lead 'em home?
who'll pick up all the bodies when you're done?
it wont be me
'cause I just learned to run

who'll walk the ghosts of men you've known?
who'll take their hands and lead 'em home?
who'll pick up all the bodies when you're done?
it wont be me
'cause I just learned to run---Lyrics submitted by ronvineyard.
