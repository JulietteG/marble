We all come from broken homes
Broken hearts and broken bones
We will live and die alone x2

Welcome to the end
Tonight we will desend
We are not the enemies
But we cannot be friends

I wanna go on record to say
That I wanna live to see the day
Where the world starts grasping for air
We hear your cries, nobody cares
I wanna breath my final breathe
Knowing you died a painful death
The fucking world is an ugly place
But I will die with a smile on my face

My life, is a shooting range
People never change

We all come from broken homes
Broken hearts and broken bones
We will live and die alone x2

Welcome to the end
Tonight we will desend
We are not the enemies
But we cannot be friends

My life, is a shooting range
People never change---Lyrics submitted by carlos.
