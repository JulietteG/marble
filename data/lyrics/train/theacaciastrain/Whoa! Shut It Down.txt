whoa!
i'm so sick of these lies
so sick of your mouth 
i know where you live 
i see where you sleep
so lets settle this here and now
i'm not wasting away my life 
because you dont like 
what i have to say
sorry i'm not just like you
sorry
who are you again 
remind me cause i dont care
i hope you like this 
i really hope you do 
i hope you like this
as much as getting your face 
busted in with a hammer
you will die a silent life 
(every one will suffer)
i have given up on you 
so who the fuck do you think you are
you will learn to breathe through a straw
who the fuck do you think you are
give it up 
do the world a favor 
pull your bottom lip over your face and swallow
i dont mean any disrespect
but i hope you are burried alive
your world is about to come crashing down
every one will suffer
your world is about to come crashing down
everyone will suffer---Lyrics submitted by Abbie.
