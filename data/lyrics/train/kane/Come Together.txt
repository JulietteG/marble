I've got a thing for you
I've got a thing for you
and I don't really mind

I know a thing to do
I know a thing to do
'cause we're two of a kind

Don't say no, cause you don't understand
Don't let go, while it's still in your hands

I've got a thing for you
I've got a thing for you
and it's under my skin

Don't say no, saying this isn't real
Don't let go,'cause you don't really feel

Come together 
Come together 
Ohohooh
More than ever
More than ever

I've got a thing for you
I've got a thing for you
and we don't have to know why

All the things we'll do
Oh, all the things we'll do
if you give it a try

This ain't over, this ain't even begun
One step closer, now we got to move on

Come together 
Come together 
Ohohooh
More than ever
More than ever

Don't say no, cause you don't understand
Don't let go, while it's still in your hands

I've got a thing for you
I've got a thing for you

(Ooooohhh)

Come together 
Come together 
Ohohooh
More than ever
More than ever

Come together 
Come together 
Ohohooh
More than ever
More than ever

Don't say no, cause you don't understand
Don't let go, while it's still in your hands
Don't say no, we've got nothing to fear
Don't let go, the future is already here---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
