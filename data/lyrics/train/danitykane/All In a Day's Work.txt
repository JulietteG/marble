Just closed a deal
All in a day's work
Damn, I'm so thrill
All in a day's work
I made a mill without touching yo man
Kiss 'em back and put you down next
Once or twice and still a bad ass bitch
(What you doing?)

I'm making it
I'm taking it.
I'm breaking it
Yes sir
I'm racking in some bacon
In some high heels and a skirt
I'm industry
I'm in the streets
I'm corporate and secure
I'm bossin' and you basic
And that there is just absurd

Just closed a deal
All in a day's work
Damn, I'm so thrill
All in a day's work
I made a mill without touching yo man
Kiss 'em back and put you down next
Once or twice and still a bad ass bitch

I'm making this shit look easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
I'm making this look easy
Please believe me
Come and see me
I'm making this shit look easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
I'm making this look easy
Please believe me
Come and see me
(What you doing, huh?)

I got you, babe
I'll take care of my own
Telephone interview
While ironing your clothes
Multi-fascinating, classy, fine
Just know
That thing will be waiting
When you walk through that door

I'm making it
I'm taking it 
I'm breaking it
Yes sir
I'm racking in some bacon
In some high heels and a skirt
I'm industry
I'm in the streets
I'm corporate and secure
I'm bossin' and you basic
And that there is just absurd
