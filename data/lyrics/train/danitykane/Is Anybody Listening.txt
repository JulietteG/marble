been waiting to see the light
been waiting now all my life
show me a way
wont you show me a way

i want to come out of the dark
but breaking away is so hard
show me a way
just show me a way

show me which way to go 
cant do this by my self(cant do this know oh oh know)
dont know how i should play the card that ive been dealt
anybody hear

CHORUS: is anybody listening
can anybody answer my payer(ooh answer my praayer)
please say yes(ooh say yes)
does anybody feel the same
and is there anybody who cares? 
lifes unfair
its so unfair

i want something more that this
i've given all i can give
show me a way
just show me a way

i just want to feel i belong
i just need the stength to be strong
show me a way
yeah just show me a way

don't know which way to go can't do this all alone
(ooh i cant do this all alone)
don't feel like i know how to make it on my own
(own) can anybody hear

chorus:

is anybody listing ohhh wow ohh wow ohh ohh
is anybody listening ohh wow ohh wow ohh ohh
is anybody listening?
