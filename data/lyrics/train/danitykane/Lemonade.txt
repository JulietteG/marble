(feat. Tyga)

Love it when I'm flexin' up in my car
Door swing, open from my passenger
Look up in the mirror, fix my mascara
People wanna know who the Hell is her
Drop top riding in my coupe deVille
[I, I]I stay my mobbin', in my hoopty still
Rattlin' the trunk when I play the track
Words to the left, yelling holler back

Ooh, these haters got a sour ass look upon their face
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
They lookin' so thirsty
They might just need a drink
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade

I feel your eyes on me,
I like how it feels
I hope that you enjoy your five
But I'll take it from here
I'm late to the party, but always on time
Misunderstood, but I'm always on your mind

Who cares if we turn up every night the top down
When we pull up at the light
Don't listen to what nobody say
So loud, I can't hear nobody say nothing
I wish you'd say something
While me and my girls is stuntin'
Ain't no problems here,
See, I'm just trying to have me a good time

Ooh, these haters got a sour ass look upon their face
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
They lookin' so thirsty
They might just need a drink
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade

I'm rockin' my sunnies
To block all this shade
We over here settin' up shop
Slingin' lemonade
I'm late to the party, but I'm always on time
Misbehaving, always up to no good
Who cares if we turn up every night the top down
When we pull up at the light
Don't listen to what nobody say
So loud, I can't hear nobody say nothing
I wish you'd say something
While me and my girls is stuntin'
Ain't no problems here,
See, I'm just trying to have me a good time

Ooh, these haters got a sour ass look upon their face
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
Uuuu, they lookin' so thirsty,
They might just need a drink
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade

[Tyga:]
What you mad for
The ice in my charm,
Forget no flaws, I'm daddy T-Raww, trips around the world
I'm open arms to a door, you my chicks spoil
Be loyal, lord I'm royal
Whipping that brief, catch a case if they try follow
She top dollar!
No events already got it.. Intoxicated,Faded,
How we got home
Glad we made it, I know they hate it
Smug up on their faces, blue in the face
Smur faces what I do for you
Morning in the bank statement
What she do for me
You know they turn crazy
I like that I like that
Im so serious she get serious
I bite that dont bite that
I like that go like that
Come right back she right back
You mad my chick bad

Ooh, these haters got a sour ass look upon their face
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
Uuuu, they lookin' so thirsty,
They might just need a drink
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade ---
