I've met some people along the way,
Some of them split some of them stay, 
Some of them walk some walk on by, 
I've got a few friends I'll love till I die
From all of these people I try to learn,
Some of them shine some of them burn,
Some of them rise some of them fall, 
For good or bad I've known them all

We live our life in our own way, 
Never really listened to what they say, 
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away 
We are the true believers
We are the true believers

Well you can fight or you can run, 
Hide under a rock till the war is won, 
Play it safe and don't make a sound, 
But not us we won't back down 
True believers all the way, 
You and I...

We live our life in our own way, 
Never really listened to what they say, 
The kind of faith that doesn't fade away 
We are the true believers
We are the true believers
True believers---Lyrics submitted by Andy.
