Now when I'm with you, I get this feeling 
That I can't let go, it's like I'm losing 
Control all over my body, yeah, yeah 
Now just a spect of you getting closer 
One touch from you boy it's over 
You turn me on 
You turn me on 

Tell me what you're doin' 
'Cause I  aint never really had a man that make me feel this way 
Something that you do it's so hard to believe 
Boy you leavin' me so amazed 
You make me say yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Whatever, whenever 
Just as long as you keep on turnin' me on 

Ooh, it feels so good to be your lady 
Ooh, it feels so good to be your lady 

You're givin' me chills up and down my spine 
You're makin' me lose my mind 
I don't want this to be ever be over, to ever be over 
See I'm lovin' you by my side 
You do it right every time 
You turnin' me on 
Turnin' me on, turnin' me on 
Turnin' me on, turnin' me on 

Tell me what you're doin' 
'Cause I aint never really had a man that make me feel this way 
Something that you do it's so hard to believe 
Boy you leavin' me so amazed 
You make me say yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Whatever, whenever 
Just as long as you keep on turnin' me on 

Ooh, it feels so good to be your lady 
Ooh, it feels so good to be your lady 

Tell me what you're doin' 
'Cause I aint never really had a man that make me feel this way 
Something that you do it's so hard to believe 
Boy you leavin' me so amazed 
You make me say yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
Whatever, whenever 
Just as long as you keep on turnin' me on 

Ooh, it feels so good to be your lady 
Ooh, it feels so good to be your lady 

Turnin' me on---Lyrics submitted by precious.
