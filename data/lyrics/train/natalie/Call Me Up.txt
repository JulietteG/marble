Hi, this is Natalie 
Leave a message after the beep 
And I'll give you a call back 
Remember if you don't leave a message 
I don't know who called 
Thanks 

Aye, yo, Natalie what's up, girl 
I ain't heard or seen you in a while 
Just like to see what's up with you 
Get with me man 
Holla

I got your message today 
I was happy to hear your voice 
Automatically saved 
When it comes to you, I had no choice 
I must act like I don't wanna call you back 
I stayed up last night, waiting for the phone to flash 
What would it be like if I don't call so fast 
Let a few hours past, see if my patience coud last 

Everytime you call me up I'm playing hard to get 
I really wanna pick up, I keep hitting end 
I don't know what to say, you got me speechless 
Leave a message babe 
Maybe at a better time, when I can get online 
And tell you what's on my mind 
And then we can conversate, maybe we can conversate 

Baby, I know you might think I'm just playin' 
You don't see the smile I get, baby 
When the phone rings, you call me 
I really wish you would come and hold me 
Baby, I know you might think I'm just playin' 
You don't see the smile I get, baby 
When the phone rings, you call me 
I really wish you would come and hold me 

Now it ain't my style to have you guess how I feel about you 
I'm always thinking about you, I'm always talking about you 
Don't wanna let you know I have the words 
I end up all jittery 
And all the words I can't control what you do to me 
All it takes is one little thing 
I hear a ring, I see your name 

Everytime you call me up I'm playing hard to get 
I really wanna pick up, I keep hitting end 
I don't know what to say, you got me speechless 
Leave a message babe 
Maybe at a better time, when I can get online 
And tell you what's on my mind 
And then we can conversate, maybe we can conversate 

Baby, I know you might think I'm just playin' 
You don't see the smile I get, baby 
When the phone rings, you call me 
I really wish you would come and hold me 
Baby, I know you might think I'm just playin' 
You don't see the smile I get, baby 
When the phone rings, you call me 
I really wish you would come and hold me 

Here's how I'm gonna tell you 
I'm gonna call you up tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight 
Be up-tight and honest with you 
If I'ma do it tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight 
No more holding back or acting shy 
I'm gonna call you up tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight 
Iet you know you're the one i like 
If I'ma do it tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight 

Baby, I know you might think I'm just playin' 
You don't see the smile I get, baby 
When the phone rings, you call me 
I really wish you would come and hold me 
Baby, I know you might think I'm just playin' 
You don't see the smile I get, baby 
When the phone rings, you call me 
I really wish you would come and hold me 

Baby, I know you might think I'm just playin' 
You don't see the smile I get, baby 
When the phone rings, you call me 
I really wish you would come and hold me 
Baby, I know you might think I'm just playin' 
You don't see the smile I get, baby 
When the phone rings, you call me 
I really wish you would come and hold me
