There's a bar room 
Just a place to spend my time
With crowds and whiskey
To help ease what's on my mind
The same tired faces
All pretending life is fine
The same tired eyes in the mirror
Pretending they won't cry

She said down we go for the last time
She picked up her life and drove away
Down we go for the last time
I'm so afraid i can't go on
A place to prove she's really gone
Down we go

She was an angel
Like once upon a time
Like the story
That keeps playin on my mind
And all her smiles
That used to fill my days
Are faded memories
In the smokey neon haze

She said down we go for the last time
She picked up her life and drove away
Down we go for the last time
I'm so afraid i can't go on
A place to prove she's really gone
Down we go

Oooh sometimes in my life it seems
All my hopes and dreams just fade to gray
And like the whiskey in my glass
Tonight i'll drown her memories away

She said down we go for the last time
She picked up her life and drove away
Down we go for the last time
I'm so afraid i can't go on
A place to prove she's really gone
Down we go

I'm so afraid i can't go on
A place to prove she's really gone
Down we go---Lyrics submitted by MICHAEL MAY.
