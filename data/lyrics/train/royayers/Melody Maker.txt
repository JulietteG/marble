Melody Maker.....Play it for me,
Life in all it's Melodies.
Melody Maker...Play it for me,
The mysteries that surround me.

Everything does change. This I have Learned,
And if I'm to see my way through,
I'll need to know what Life's about,
Play me Your sweet Melody.

Melody Maker, Lead Me to Know
The forms that each man's heart can be.
Melody Maker, Lead Me to Know
The discords..and harmonies.

And when I have grown older,
And the World treats me Cold,
I'll continue my life with a smile.

And if One should Ask,what Life's about?
I'll sing. I'll sing...
I'll sing your sweet, sweet Melody.

(instrumental Bridge)

Melody Maker.....Play it for me,
Life in all it's Melodies.
Melody Maker...Play it for me,
The mysteries that surround me.

Everything does change. This I have Learned,
And if I'm to see my way through,
I'll need to know what Life's about,
Play me Your sweet Melody.---Lyrics submitted by Ron Chavis.
