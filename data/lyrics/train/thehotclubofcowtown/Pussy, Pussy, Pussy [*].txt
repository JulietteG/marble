*meowing*

Say fellers! I can't seem to find my pussycat. Could you help me find him?

Of course, of course, of course, of course! Come on gang, let's call him!

Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, where can you be?
Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, come back to me.
Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, where do you roam?
Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, please come home.

Hey lady, is this your cat, lady?
No, no.
What about this one, lady. Is this your cat?
No!
Hey lady, how about this cat over here?
*knock*
No, no, no!

My pussy has no stripes, and besides, it ain't never smelled like that!
Call my cat boys, call my pussy!

Ah, yeah sir.

Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, where can you be?
Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, come back to me.
Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, where do you roam?
Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, please come home.---Lyrics submitted by Shannon Lagasse.
