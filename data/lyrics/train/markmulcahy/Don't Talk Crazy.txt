In my blind romantic eye
I made a simple supposition
To go away and come one day
Pick it up right where we left off
I was wrong and you went along
Smiling and waving as the bus pulled out of town
It was my mistake to make you wait
And now I know Ill be lucky if you even want me to come back

Well dont talk crazy I couldnt bear saying goodbye
All I did was wish that you wouldnt die
Just come back to me with that same look
Just come back to me baby with that same look in your eye

You make it seem like you always knew
Had a premonition like I never do
Now Im flat out in a hospital bed
Staring at the ceiling fan spinning slowly over my head
I dont want to hear you say Im a hero
Cause honest to God I was just trying to get out of the way
They gave me Purple Heart, but honey I dont want it
Maybe wed both be better off if I just came home in a box

Well dont talk crazy and please dont make me
More afraid than I already am
Not for myself, its you, Im fine
Im fine as long as I know Ill be seeing you soon

Yea maybe I feel the same way
But all this time, and now Im
Im just a part of what I was
I wanted to carry my daughter upstairs to bed at night
Are they right, its a sacrifice
Its all yours, not mine
And youre there but Im here
You got everything and baby all I got to offer is me

Well dont talk crazy about how its gonna be
Baby you are never far away from me
Maybe things are different, but nothings changed
Just come home to me baby, please come home---Lyrics submitted by Burrell.
