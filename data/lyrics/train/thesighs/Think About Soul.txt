Use to Think That I
Would never be the foul again
Then I realized my limit defense
Close my eyes
I'm never going back again
Changed my mind

Now I only think about
(Soul)
Think About
(Soul)
I Think About
(Soul)
Think about keeping myself controlled
(Soul)
Think About
(Soul)
I Think About
(Soul)

When they ask me why
I never tell them were I've been
The reaction might 
send me to us then
Close my eyes
I'm never going back again
Changed my mind

Now I only think about
(Soul)
Think About
(Soul)
I Think About
(Soul)
Think about keeping myself controlled
(Soul)
Think About
(Soul)
I Think About
(Soul)

Now I only think about soul

And the bizzare
to get by
Had to close my eyes
and let it die

Now I know
That you
and I
Are never going be again
Till you change
your life

Now I only think about
(Soul)
Think About
(Soul)
I Think About
(Soul)
Think about keeping myself controlled
(Soul)
Think About
(Soul)
I Think About
(Soul)

Now I only think about
(Soul)
Think About
(Soul)
I Think About
(Soul)
Think about keeping myself controlled
(Soul)
Think About
(Soul)
I Think About
(Soul)

Now I only think about Soul

Yeah, Yeah
