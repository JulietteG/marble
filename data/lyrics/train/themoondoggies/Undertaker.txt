Oooh-oooh-ooooh Oooh-ooh-ooh Oooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooh Oooh-ooh-ooh Oooh-ooh-ooh

Oh when that old world died
I went looking for a place to hide
And with no one to confide
And this loneliness I can't fight
I ain't bettin' on a worried hand
I keep walkin' through the worried land
I ain't bettin' on a losin' hand

Ooooh-ooh-ooh

I do not fear the Undertaker
When he comes to
Lay my soul down
Lay my soul down
Oh touch the hands of those behind
Passerbys gonna sing goodbyes
To those who fear
Hold on sweet dears
Nothin's gonna change how you dream
There's no way home
Wander down old days
Wander still on old ways
Still as ever

I'll do whatever it takes to set my heart free
I'll do whatever it takes to set my heart free
I'll do whatever it takes to set my heart free
To set my heart free

Words get overused
Lose all meaning too
Oh I've been such a fool
So I've been told
So I've been told

I'll do whatever it takes to set my heart free
I'll do whatever it takes to set my heart free

Oooh-oooh-ooooh Oooh-ooh-ooh Oooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-oooh-ooooh Oooh-ooh-ooh Oooh-ooh-ooh

Oh when that old world died
I went looking for a place to hide---Lyrics submitted by Troy.
