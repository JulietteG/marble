I don't expect you to understand
What exactly is inside a man
But you were all resolved 
To flee into the ocean

But you're in my mind now
And I guess I'll blame the sun
'Cause all it's done, is make me dream
And when I dream, I dream, I dream 
About your red [brown] hair

Oh's

And I know I should take it easy
Well maybe I'm wrong
'Cause you're off to seep in
Into a reason

Or disappearing behind the season
Ever soon the light of the moon
Will stop you in your tracks
Yeah, I hope the light of the moon
Stops you in your tracks

Yeah

There's been a lot of talk about the big walk
With a suit case, and the road block
La da da da da dum da

Oh right here, riding the heiress
Oh my dear, home
'Cause you know I'd
You know I'd be at rest

Oh's

I don't expect you to understand
What exactly is inside a man
But you were all resolved 
To flee into the ocean---Lyrics submitted by Troy.
