we met one day in wet cement
 where we glued our eyes shut
 and pressed with our fists
 and while the trees are shrinking now
 they forgot their roots
 and sloped in the ground
 and while I'm picking out my favorite names
 where our future is concerned
 in the steady blur of the days
 what brought us here, why we try to say
 we face back all the way

now the cement's hardened in my chest
 a world of wax
 scraped in through text
 and someone was calling just before I woke up
 my broken record spits good and bad luck
 and with my broken, pale black eyes
 I still see white when the snow falls lightly
 in the steady blur of the days
 what brought us here, why we try to say
 but we face back all the way---Lyrics submitted by leah.
