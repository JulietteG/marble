Hold me tonight 
What happend to me 
My head in the clouds 
Fallen so deep 
You came in soft 
No shoes on my feet 
Cold and afraid 
It feels like I could break down 
Right here on this shore 
I'll go a straight 

Here I stand, 
Where earth meets water 
The wind blows smoke, 
across the land 
So hear me out, 
our lives get harder 
It slips through our fingers, 
like this fist full of sand 
like a fist full of sand 

Lay down tonight 
The stars as our spine 
Summer will fade 
And it feels like I will lose you, 
with each of the turning tides 
Till the first snow arrives 

So here I stand, 
Where earth meets water 
The wind blows smoke, 
across the land 
So hear me out, 
our lifes get harder 
It slips through our fingers, 
like this fist full of sand 

Here I stand, 
Where earth meets water 
It slips through our fingers, 
like a fist full of sand 

It slips through our fingers---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
