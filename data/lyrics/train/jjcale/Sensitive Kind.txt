Dont take her for granted, she has a hard time
Dont misunderstand her or play with her mind
Treat her so gently, it will pay you in time
Youve got to know shes the sensitive kind
Tell her you love her, each and every night
And you will discover she will treat you right
If you believe, I know you will find
There aint nothing like the sensitive kind
She gets lonely waiting for you
You are the only thing to help her through
Dont take her for granted, she has a hard time
Youve got to know shes the sensitive kind---Lyrics submitted by ido.
