Just below San Diego
Tijuana, land of broken dreams
Senoritas dancing in the moonlight
Flashing Spanish dark eyes
to everyone, it seems

They say "Hey, gringo
Can you take us across the border
Just tell them I'm your daughter
un poco loco

Down the backstreets, through the alleys
All the young men stand with pride
They guard the palace to the kingdom
Called Tijuana, the entrance they disguise

They say "Hey, gringo
Can you take us across the border
We'll work for just a quarter
On the other side" ---Lyrics submitted by Ins Benyounes.
