I never wanted you to leave
I only said those things
Because I knew they'd hurt you
You can believe what you believe
I'll be here in the dark
Until you find me

I don't wanna be the last one to know
Even if I have to hear I have an incurable disease
Please call when you reach your decision
Tell the truth even if it hurts
It will hurt me too

Castaway
I was floating in blue skies
Barely hanging with a broken hand
Wait and see if I sink or swim
You pull me up hopefully
Why do I want you to save me
When I was castaway

I stare ahead into a dream
I'm losing a part of me
Systems failure
In a crowded room
And I'm all alone
Watch my face turn into stone
And somehow drift away

I don't wanna be the last one to know
Even though I know whats coming
And it's typical typical
Your minds made up
There's no decision
Tell the truth even if it hurts
It will hurt me too

Castaway
I was floating in blue skies
Barely hanging with a broken hand
Wait and see if I sink or swim
You pull me up hopefully
Why do I want you to save me
When I was castaway

But now I'm stronger
Now I'm stronger
Now I'm stronger

Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
I was floating in blue skies
Barely hanging with a broken hand
Wait and see
(If I sink or swim
You pull me up)
Hopefully
(Why do I want you to save me
When I was)
