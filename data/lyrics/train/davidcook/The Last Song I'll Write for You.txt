I can tell something's not the same
Cause we're both losing at the loving game
We're hanging from words
Your tongue is a fire
And I can't keep putting out the flames

There was a time when you could tell the world
That you, you knew I would fight for you
You knew I would fight for you
But now I know that I can't let you go
Cause I wrote the last song I'll write for you
The last song I'll write for you

I've been waiting just to feel this way
Where my night's not made by every day
That you ever had, the good and the bad cause I
I'm through calling out your name

There was a time when you could tell the world
That you, you knew I would fight for you
You knew I would fight for you
But now I know that I can't let you go
Cause I wrote the last song I'll write for you
The last song I'll write for you

We're just drifting apart
Two beats in two different hearts
Before I say goodnight, I want you to know

There was a time when you could tell the world
That you, you knew I would fight for you
You knew I would fight for you
But now I know that I can't let you go
Cause I wrote the last song I'll write for you
The last song I'll write for you

Now I know that I can't let you go
Cause I wrote the last song I'll write for you
The last song I'll write for you ---
