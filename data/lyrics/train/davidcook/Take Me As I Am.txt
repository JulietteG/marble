Versus

This is no escape, this is no surrender my dear... 
This is my parade, my happy ever after, 
But only if your here... 
When I'm lost and broken... 

Chorus

Take me as I am, right here where I stand... 
Open up your arms and let me in.
Out here on my own, I know I'm not alone.
Let me in your heart right where you stand... 
Take me as I am... 

Versus

We could take tonight, make it last forever
If you dare... 
Ooooo, we could run away and take the world together, 
But only if you care... 
With these words unspoken... 

Chorus

Take me as I am, right here where I stand... 
Open up your arms and let me in.
Out here on my own, I know I'm not alone.
Let me in your heart right where you stand... 
Take me as I am... 

Versus

Give a second chance, 
We could take tomorrow make it better, 
You and me... 

Give me one more try before we say goodbye.
Right here in this moment, 
Here forever, everyday... 

Take me as I am.
Right here where I stand.
Open up your arms and let me in... 

Chorus

Take me as I am, right here where I stand... 
Open up your arms and let me in.
Out here on my own, I know I'm not alone.
Let me in your heart right where you stand... 
Take me as I am... 
Take me as I am... 
Take me as I am... 
Take me as I am... 
Take me as I am...---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
