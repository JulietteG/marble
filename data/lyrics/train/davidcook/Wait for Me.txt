I was drunk as the morning sun
A ball of fire and I just begun
To drink you in, oh
Another picture in a broken frame
And I remember I'm the one to blame
Where do I begin

'Cause I've been crying salt into an open wound
Since I don't remember when
So as I slowly opened up my eyes
Oh I can see you on the other side
The other side

No matter where you go
Yeah, will you let me know?
Will you wait for me, wait for me?
More than I ever knew
Yeah, all I need is you
Will you wait for me, wait for me?

Falling faster by the afternoon
Connecting dots around the black and blue
It's sinking in, oh
And I can smell you on my pillowcase
But I may never get to see your face
Here again, oh

So I'll keep crying salt into this open wound
Until I feel again
And if I ever open up my eyes
Will I see you on the other side?
The other side

No matter where you go
Yeah, will you let me know?
Will you wait for me, wait for me?
More than I ever knew
Yeah, all I need is you
Will you wait for me, wait for me?

So I'll keep dying slowly from this open wound
Until you come home again

No matter where you go
Yeah, will you let me know?
Will you wait for me, wait for me?
More than I ever knew
Yeah, all I need is you
Will you wait for me, wait for me?

No matter where you go
Yeah, will you let me know?
Will you wait for me, wait for me?
More than I ever knew
Yeah, all I need is you
Will you wait for me, wait for me?

I'm as drunk as the morning sun
A ball of fire and I've just begun
To drink you in---
