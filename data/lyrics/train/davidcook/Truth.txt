Two steps removed from every thing I thought I knew
There's no remedy
I see your face in every single thing I do
You change me
Your laugh intoxicating
One touch and I'm negating everything around
Take me and I'm yours
I only want you anymore
I kiss the ground

If you want to know the truth,
You make or break my day
If you want to know the truth
I wouldn't have it any other way

I rest my head from running circles 'round my mind
On why you let go
No answers to be found, romances don't rewind
I guess I'll never know
Why your absence is devastating
No touch to calm my head and everyone around
You leave me when I'm yours
'cause you don't want me anymore
I hit the ground, yeah

If you want to know the truth,
You make or break my day
If you want to know the truth
I wouldn't have it any other way, yeah

If you want to know the truth,
You make or break my day
If you want to know the truth
I wouldn't have it any other way

If you want to know the truth,
You make or break my day
If you want to know the truth
I wouldn't have it any other way
Any other way
If you want to know the truth,
You make or break my day
Any other way
If you want to know the truth,
You make or break my day
Any other way---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
