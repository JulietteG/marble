Where did you hide yourself
For these searchlights are growing dim
I know this isn't much to recollect
Better now to close this puppet show
And say that it's the end
But for me,
Could you ready yourself
And hold on for a moment?
Just for me,
Could you bury it all
And hold on to this moment?

You made me fall forever
With no end in sight
When everything around is broken
Could you say that this felt right?

You are, for contradiction's sake,
Everything I remember that I swore I'd forget
You life has served you well
But everyone around has perished
From this fire that you've lit
Under me
I can ready myself
To hold on for a moment
Lock and key,
Trying to bury it all
And begin in this moment

You made me fall forever
With no end in sight
When everything around is broken
Could you say that this felt right?

You made me fall forever
With no end in sight
When everything around is broken
Could you say that this felt right?

You made me fall forever
With no end in sight
When everything around is broken
Could you say that this felt right?
Say it felt right
Say it felt right
Say it felt right
Say it felt right---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
