Here we are at the starting line
Of a race that goes till the end of time
You and I

Take a long deep breath and I'll take one too
As the seconds fade and the minutes move
I'm by your side

Lfe's a countdown that never ends
And the world we know keeps on caving in
We can hold on
I will hold on

Till the clocks run out
Till the sun breaks down
I'll be all the love you need
Till the stars turn cold
I'll never let you go
From here to zero

A love we sent from a second look
Like a flower pressed in your favorite book
By the window sill

We got lost in a passing glance
As the winter frost melted in our hands
And time stood still

Life's a countdown that never stops
Will it all fall down as we count the cost
We can hold on
I will hold on

Till the clocks run out
Till the sun breaks down
I'll be all the love you need
Till the stars turn cold
I'll never let you go
From here to zero

And every point in between
From curtain up to closing scene
(The spotlight we've been living in)
Look in your heart and please believe
I'll never go I'll never leave
From here until the end

Till the clocks run out
Till the sun breaks down
I'll be all the love you need
Till the stars turn cold
I'll never let you go
From here to zero

Till the clocks run out
Till the sun breaks down
I'll be all the love you need
Till the stars turn cold
I'll never let you go
From here to zero---Lyrics submitted by Sue.
