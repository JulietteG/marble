Tearin' all over the forests of Maine
And the snow is all white on the pines
And the sad laughing cry of the seagull dies
Just like mine.
Oooooo oooo oooo.  Oooooo oooo ooooo.

I walked all over these dark windy woods
With my hunting spear and my disguise.
But the green trees all groan at
The sight of the woe in my eyes.
Oooooo oooo oooo.  Oooooo oooo ooooo.

Soft is the voice that I hear in my heart.
Cold as the steel traps outside
As I stare in the ember it's you I remember
My sweet summer bride.
Oooooo oooo oooo.  Oooooo oooo ooooo.---Lyrics submitted by Tom baker.
