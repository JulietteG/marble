They ran through hills and forest
As two under a spell
He was a city boy Floyd the outlaw
But I thought I knew him well.

Long after that great summer
When I first came into my fame
And the avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to my name
The avenger I became.

Well they call me avenging Annie
Im avenger of womanhood
I spend my whole life telling lies
Leads them on a mess and over good

I take all you spoilt young hippies
Running around playing games
They're surrounding your bed, I'll blow your head
I'll put you through a change.

What you've done to others
I'll do unto you.

But then I met my sensitive outlaw
He was the best thing I had ever seen
I want to be his wife want to give him my life,
I was so blind I could never had seen.
No!

So I joined up with my outlaw
And headed for California.

He treated me worse than I ever imagined
He didn't say he don't want me around
Kept it up so long, I couldn't be strong
He run me right into the ground.

After five long years,
He picked me up and then he slapped me down.

Then I told my friends about him
They all were on my side
But I could see through the haze he looked so crazy
I put my head right down and I cried.

And for my poor lover
Who cried like a mother for her poor lover.
And I felt so bad about him
But I knew I couldnt do him no good
He was so far gone was standing all alone
When I left him I knew I shouldnt
I knew I couldnt do him no good

And now I live out on a mountain top
And Im almost thirty-five
And I found my peace and found my release
And Im happy just to be alive.

And I might go back to my Floyd
If I think it's the thing to do
He gave up murder and theft right after I left
And you know I still love him too

Just like your woman loves you  (15x)

Well they call me avenging Annie
Im avenger of womanhood      
I spend my whole life telling lies
Leads you on a messy life
