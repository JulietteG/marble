Oh baby you're too pure 
You're too pure for this wicked world 
Your data's uncorrupted 
But does something skip inside you? 

That's what takes up time in this life 
Add up the sum of the slights and 
Sooner or later 
Love comes inside you, gets behind you 
Takes you under it's wing 
Is it some kind of function? 
A reconstruction of what you've always been? 

Sense memory, that's so passe 
Is that what passes for vision these days? 
I engineer no strangeness 
I don't have that modern streak 
What fills up this space in your life? 
Does the sum of the slights hurt? 
Sooner or later 
Love comes inside you, gets behind you 
Takes you under it's wing 
Is it some kind of function? 
A reconstruction of what you've always been? 

Time can't hurt you 
I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world 
You can do it youself, but make your ends known to your means and your lovers 

Drop your guard, get over yourself 
Kick your shoes to the floor and 
Run from your cover, run to the other side of your head and I'll stand right by you 

Love comes inside you, gets behind you 
Takes you under it's wing 
Is it some kind of function? 
A reconstruction of what you've always been? 

Love comes inside you, gets behind you 
Takes you under it's wing 
Is it some kind of function? 
A reconstruction of what you've always been? 

Time can't hurt you 
I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world---
