To hit the mark,
To bring the rain,
To take a climb,
The path to fame.

I sat dreaming alone,
Then it came out of nowhere.
An all too familiar voice with a false face:
The voice of the jealous.
It's less than encouraging.
Walls have been closing in.
Though in droves the masses came.
Years from now they'll say:

From the way out, from the way out
Fools rushing over the hills,
There to watch him fall,
There to watch him fall.

And there amidst the sleepless night it came to me.
Endurance, endurance, it came to me
And now nothing can stop me or keep me in line.
Get out of the way as I take to the sky.

It's hard to discern all the motives I see.
One thing's for sure, when the crowds have dispersed and forgotten me
And forgotten their dreams,
I'll still be all that I am.
I am more than a clown for you
Hear me, and know it to be true.

From the way out, from the way out
Fools rushing over the hills,
There to watch him fall,
There to watch him fall.---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
