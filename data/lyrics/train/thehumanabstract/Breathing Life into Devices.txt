Tap the primal circuit,
The current lets you know you're alive.
Make this crushing power ceaseless,
You could capture the world.
When embracing the electric kingdom,
Know that it could all come crashing down.
With unseen surges coming closer,
I fight to defend my denied throne.

I took selected analysis.
That day I never felt more addicted.
Barely surviving the shock,
Soon I found myself in a cruel revolving door.
You said failure, I said you're turning to

Cruel sources,
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources,
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from cruel sources.

Change up the trend for the hell of it,
Then you'll see I never did support it.
Carving away at the block
I became the light I'd so long been searching for.
You said savior, I said you're turning to

An electric current fuels the lust again.
Like a feral god 
I've stepped far outside the lines
But I feel no shame.
I stole the scales and I cleared my name.
Now try,
Try to pry them from my dead hands.
Now try,
Try to pry them from my dead hands.

Cruel sources,
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources,
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from you.---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
