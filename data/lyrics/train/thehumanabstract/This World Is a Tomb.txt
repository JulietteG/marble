Slaving for my solace of mind
Digging in the sand until there's blood on my hands,
Careless to the state I'm in,
I've so long been alone,
I've so long been alone.
I can't go on.

Rain down, rain down
Cleanse my soul, flow like a river.

Forging insight by pagan torchlight,
In cadence warlike,
We draw tears from the sky
Because the well's run dry.

Rain down, rain down
Cleanse my soul, flow like a river.

I've spread out my seed,
It's gone in all directions.
It starts to feel like 
The promiseland is a fantasy
And heaven has been swallowed by the desert.

In a drought without submission,
Not a cloud in the sky,
This course keeps getting harder,
The more I try.
I dig up dry bones
And the corpses cry as they open their eyes
To see the world's decay.
This world's a tomb,
There's a clamor in my heart and it's over
Where is my prize?
It's over
Where is my prize?
My promised prize.

Forging insight by pagan torchlight,
In cadence warlike,
We draw tears from the sky

Rain down, rain down
Cleanse my soul, flow like a river.---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
