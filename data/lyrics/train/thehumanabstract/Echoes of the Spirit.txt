Until you're ready to break
Until you're ready to bend
Critical condition, critical.

The years will wear down every brick you lay.
There's more to life than selling your days.
Money makes sense in the world today, they say.
I'm not living that way.

Setting off, setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own.
I won't be a product on the industry line,
You stand for nothing or you stand alone.

Leave it to us to cross the final line.
Can you feel the dawning of our time?
Take a moment to turn and see the signs.
Can you feel the dawning of our time?
Time to wake up and turn the light on,
Come on turn the light on.

Setting off, setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own.
I won't be a product on the industry line,
You stand for nothing or you stand alone.

Pitiful,
Doing what you're told.
In turn,
They granted you power.
In a condescending tone,
You stand on the watchtower,
Here in our last hour,
And say that you know.
Typical
Of those that will never see.
Say that you know.
Typical
Of those that will never be free.
Just like that,
Took our strongest years
In the name of greed.
Just like that
And made commercials out of our broken dreams.

As pitch black factory stacks turn all the world's beautiful colors to gray,
Empower the rights that they can't take away:
Raise your voices!

Echoes of the spirit,
Echoes of the spirit,
Resounding in tones that set you free.
Shout with me:
We are awake!

Setting off, setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own.
I won't be a product on the industry line,
You stand for nothing or you stand alone.

We're in critical condition, critical condition.
Figured it out because we've all been here before.---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
