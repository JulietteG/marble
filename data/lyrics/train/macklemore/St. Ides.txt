I think happiness went the other way
Sometimes you just have to wait
I never believed in God
But things got so fucked up
That I had to pray
I used to steal my Daddy's cabernet
Never thought it would turn into a rattlesnake
Thinkin', everything will be all right
If we could get thru the week
Maybe see another Saturday
All the while where we know where to go
Argue with the homies bout who's gonna row
Throw on Goodie Mob
Some food for the soul
Till it's two in the morning
When rain hits the windshield
And everything is still
Nothing really is a big deal
One hand on the steering wheel
And we gonna be all right

I had a brown paper bag
St. Ides in that motherfucker
Around the city we smash
5-0 comin' then you know I'm running
Crawling the broken fences, when shit gets hard
You know who your friend is
And when I lose perspective
Need to go to a place where I lose reception
Looking at the satellites pass by
Reflect there on my past life
I can barely remember last night
Another morning, swearing it's the last time
Where would I be?
Can't start over you don't get a new ID
I know the devil fancy me
But that don't mean that motherfucker get to dance with me!

I bought a house, second guess of what I own now (What?)
Traffic movement kinda slow now (What?)
I watch a population grow wild (What?)
A bunch of people I don't know now (What?)
My city's changed and I'm zoned out
I thought about New York, maybe SoCal
Put up condos people can't afford now
Landmarks bulldozed been tore down
Overpopulated but can seem like a ghost town
Keep a couple real ones with me
When it goes down
Lack of diversity, I think about Sloane now
Only reason I would ever leave my hometown
If I still drink, I would crack a 40 ounce
Parents finally left, moved away, and they sold the house
It's really hard to ignore it now
Wish that we could sort it out
Last couple sips pour it out
St. Ides---
