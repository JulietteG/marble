what kind of car does she drive,
is her hair as soft as mine
where does she live 
does she have any kids
does her touch make you weak
whast it like to love her
and to lose me

what kind of purfume does she like 
does she melt in you arms on rainy nites
how long have you know ive know all along what did the 
two of you reach
whats it like to love her and to lose me

i hope shes everything you need and dream about
dont let what we had hit you on ur easy way out
when u lay down with her tonight we'll see who loses sleep
whats it like to love her and to lose me.

i hope shes everything you need and dream about 
dont let what we had hit you on ur easy way out
when u lay down with her tonight we'll see who loses sleep
whats it like to love her and to lose me

what kind of car does she drive, 
is her hair as soft as mine.....---Lyrics submitted by Morgan.
