Lay your gentle hands 
Softly on my skin 
Baby make sweet love to me 
Don't let this moment end 

I wanna taste your kiss 
Hear you whisper in my ear 
Help me make this feelin' 
Last a thousand years 

I wanna get so lost 
In your eyes I'll fall into 
Don't you know that lovin' you 
Is all I wanna do 

Turn the lights down low 
And i'll pour the wine 
I'll surrender to you 
Just take this heart of mine 

Take me to a place 
I've never been before 
Won't you lay me slowly down 
I couldn't want you more 

I wanna get so lost 
In your eyes i'll fall into 
Don't you know that lovin' you 
Is all I wanna do 

I wanna get so lost 
In your eyes i'll fall into 
Don't you know that loving you 
Is all I wanna do 

And forever loving you 
Is all I wanna do---Lyrics submitted by Maddy.
