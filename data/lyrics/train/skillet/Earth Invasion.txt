One man, one mission
One life to save the world
Reclaim all races and embrace our destiny.
Changing history!
When the colliding comes
Where will you run?
Come with us if you wanna meet

Join us in the army that's arising
The truth invasion love
Everyday the kingdom is advancing
The earth invasion has just begun

Without sound, without fear
It attacks the heart and soul
To rule all life and display His government

Changing history! 
When the colliding comes
Where will you run?
Come with us if you wanna meet

Join us in the army that's arising
The truth invasion love
Everyday the kingdom is advancing
The earth invasion has just begun(Repeat x2)

The earth's frustration to be whole again
We'll see a nation living without sin.
(The earth invasion)

One man, one mission
One life to save the world

Join us in the army that's arising
The truth invasion love
Everyday the kingdom is advancing
The earth invasion has just begun(Repeat x2)

The earth invasion has just begun!---Lyrics submitted by elle.
