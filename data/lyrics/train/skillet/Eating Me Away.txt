"It's eating me away"
I said to God,
"It's writing in my mind
It's like a cancer
Is there anything, anything at all
To numb the nothingness
I need a reason to breathe
It's eating me away"

Save me! (save me)
From my rage and my humanity
I want nothing to be.
Is this my legacy?
Feel it eating me away

Eating me away
It nibbles at my brain
The question of my existence
And the matter of pain
I shake my fist, I shake my fist
At the cosmos and my insignificance
I need a reason to breathe
It's eating me away

All that I am, all that I want
All that I lack, come on and save me (Repeat x2)

Save me! (save me)
From my rage and my humanity
I want nothing to be.
Is this my legacy?
Feel it eating me away

All that I am, all that I want
All that I lack, come on and save me (Repeat x2)

It's eating me away

Save me! (save me)
From my rage and my humanity
I want nothing to be.
Is this my legacy?
Feel it eating me away(Repeat x2)---Lyrics submitted by elle.
