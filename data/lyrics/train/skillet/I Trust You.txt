Learning again that I am not my own 
Crawling back to where I belong 
Caught in between knowing You and trusting me 
Come on take a ride out of the in betweens 
Now I know I need You 

Chorus: 
When I cant see, I will trust You 
And when I get weak, I trust You 
And when I just cant let it go 
I trust that You are in control 

Shelter me so I can find some peace 
Grabbing hold of You is letting go of me 
It's easy when I remember I possess all that lays beyond my grasp 
Your power commands the weight off my back 
Now I know I need You 

Chorus: 
When I cant see, I will trust You 
And when I get weak, I trust You 
And when I just cant let it go 
I trust that You are in control 

Now I know I trust Yo---Lyrics submitted by jason.
