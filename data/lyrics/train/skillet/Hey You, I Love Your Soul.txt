Am I a man who knows how to love 
When you hate what you fear the most yeah, yeah
I'll wash your feet as you spit in my face 

Hey you, I love your soul 
I'm going love you when you hate 

You can't outrun or escape this liquid 
My life poured out like water 
I'm gonna drown you with maddening forgiveness 
Hey you, I love your soul 

I can't depend on your hate to define my love 
Am I strong enough to love your soul 

Love doesn't care to receive what it gives 
Bleeding compassion to extreme 
Love stretches out to die for its enemies 
Hey you, I love your soul 

I can't depend on your hate to define my love 
Am I strong enough to love your soul 
No bounds on the deep, no bounds on the wide 

Am I deep enough to love your soul 
God I want to swim in the deep of You 
God in You I'm strong enough, 
Strong enough, strong enough 

I can't depend on your hate to define my love 
Am I strong enough to love your soul 
No bounds on the deep, no bounds on the wide 
Am I deep enough to love your soul---Lyrics submitted by olivia.
