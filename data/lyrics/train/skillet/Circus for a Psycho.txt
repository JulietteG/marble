Psycho, go, go, go
Psycho, here we go

You push until I break
And the anger turns to rage
Why cant you just leave me alone
Got your finger on the trigger
You think that youre the winner
Youre gonna get kicked off of your throne

You think youre gonna hurt me
Get ready to get dirty
You created this beast inside
Pull the noose tighter
And lift a little higher
Because youre killing me slow
I aint ready to die

Killing me slow but I aint ready to die

Tonight, get ready for a fight
So now you know its time
To ride my circus for a psycho
Round and round we go, look out below
Because I want off this
I want off this

Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, go, go, go)
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, here we go)
Psycho, here we go

Everybody down
Gonna burn it to the ground
Cant keep this beast inside
Never again, never again
Youre killing me slow but I aint ready to die

Killing me slow but I aint ready to die

Tonight, get ready for a fight
So now you know its time
To ride my circus for a psycho
Round and round we go, look out below
Because I want off this
I want off this

Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, go, go, go)
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, here we go)

You think youre gonna hurt me
Get ready to get dirty
Gonna burn this place to the ground

Tonight, get ready for a fight
So now you know its time
To ride my circus for a psycho
Round and round we go, look out below
Its time to ride my circus for a psycho

Never again, never again
Youre killing me slow but I aint ready to die
Round and round we go, look below
Because I want off this
I want off this

Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, go, go, go)
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, here we go)

Circus for a psycho
Circus for a psycho
(Psycho, here we go) ---Lyrics submitted by Dragos DCD.
