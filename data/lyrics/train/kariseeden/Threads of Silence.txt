If i gave you every inch of me
could you show me how
if i learn to be more brave
could you show me how
i take a deep breath
straighten up my back
stand tall and walk along

he said you could do anything
but anything is nothing when you need a bit of helpin out
you could go anywhere but anywehere is nowhere
but when emptiness is where you stand

holdin, holdin, holdin
the threads of silence
holdin, holdin, holdin
the threads of silence
that lead me to your door

if i hadevery book in the world
would you still tell show me how
if i was not who i am now
would you still see me now
i take a deep breath
straighten up my back
stand tall and walk along

he said you could do anything
but anything is nothing when you need a bit of helpin out
you could go anywhere but anywehere is nowhere
but when emptiness is where you stand

holdin, holdin, holdin
the threads of silence
holdin, holdin, holdin
the threads of silence
that lead me to your door

holdin, holdin, holdin
the threads of silence
holdin, holdin, im holdin
the threads of silence
that lead me to your door
that lead me to your door---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
