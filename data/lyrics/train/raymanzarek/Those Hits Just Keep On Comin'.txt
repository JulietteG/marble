Lyrics and Music: Roy Rogers / Chops Not Chaps Mesic (BMI)

Well I went down to the river
And I found my baby there
Makin' love to a friend of mine
They didn't need no rockin' chair
I didn't know what to tell her
What to say or what to do
She put a bullet through my heart
They shoulda laid me out that day

Now it's early in the mornin'
But I'm thinkin' mighty clear
The book is done for me you know
It's time to leave you here
And those hits just keep on comin'
When it comes to lovin you
I'm gonna find myself a woman
That has the time to love me too

Too much time is wasted
Tryin' to read between the lines
We tried to love each other
But it faded with the time
And those hits just keep on comin'
When it comes to lovin' you
I'm gonna find myself a woman
That has the time to love me too---Lyrics submitted by Yury.
