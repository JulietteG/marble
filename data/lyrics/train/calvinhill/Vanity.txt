Verse 1:
I claire this mess is vanity, its just vanity
Its one thing I cant stand to see
Is these money cars and clothes  and this music take humanity
man pimps and thugs are now role models 
getting high they smoking week they throwing money and they popping bottles 
when evil leads man we still follow
we still blinded by sin nature
we'll sell out to get quick paper
we yelling out that we're self-made 
we self-righteous and self-paid
idolizing our own lives 
with the lust of flesh and a heart of pride
our selfishness got me sick and tired
got me looking round as they said

Verse 2:
All it is is vanity
its just vanity 
it trips me out when I have to see
these young boys chase fools gold 
and they lose all insagnity 
it aint cool that we die young
we get drunk and we live strung
we wilding out and we chasing women 
they gang banging and still stealing
we in affair with this vanity
we so blinded by vanity
we living life in this vanity 
we so enticed by this vanity 
they lost and fooled by their own flesh
dont take the blame for their own mess 
man vanity comes in its own dress
I'm looking round as they say
