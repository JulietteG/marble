It was the cheapest of gifts
Its like a weight has been lifted
and I'm sorry I missed it
'cause it sounds like a blast
we've got trophies for boredom
like check mail they sort em'
I'm not wasted I'm saved
one foot shakin' in the grave

and this sounds like our lives have been tight
it takes money to help ourselves get right
this feels like it isn't real like
I'm sad that your so lonely, floatin' in space

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

you can do what you want to me
or kill me off comfortably
its not like I mind you poking me in the eye
but she's another story
and rather long and boring
with a rip in her spine
I'm traidin' up from my life

Is this what bein' killed feels like
Were just bugs that gather 'round the porch light
It  so long  most gone
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on

It was a promise un-kept
Another day that's been slept
We were a love that went stale
Another lover for sale
And she's got all sorts of problems
And now somehow I've got em'
She spreads like a rash
I have to feed her with cash
She's spreadin' thin on my soul
now I've got no place to go
Can you help me I'm cheap
I'm passin' out in my sleep

Is this what dead people feel like
We're all bums and someone doesn't sit right
So goodbye darlin' don't cry
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on
Just give me something to hang on---Lyrics submitted by Leroy.
