Is it alright 
If I'm with you for the night?
Hope you don't mind, 
If you stay by my side 

We can drive in your car
Somewhere into the dark,
Pull over and watch the stars
We can dance, We can sing, 
Do whatever you think
As long as I'm with you

[Chores]
When we are together 
It's the time of our lives
We can do whatever,
Be whoever we like
Spend the weekend dancing,
'Cause we sleep when we die
Don't have to worry 'bout nothing
We own the night [x4]

Its all a blur
It's getting late
But I don't care (I don't care)

I don't know where
We'll end up and that's okay

We can drive in your car
Somewhere into the dark,
Pull over and watch the stars
We can dance, We can sing, 
Do whatever you think
As long as I'm with you

[Chores]

Nothing last forever,
Let's live it up,
When we're together. 
Nothing last forever,
Let's live it up
Just do whatever 

[Chores x2]---Lyrics submitted by venny.
