You left me spinning like a disco
Trying but I don't know
If it can stand straight
You took me, left, when you knew I was right
And now I gotta fight just to make it through the day

I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up
Baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know what it's done

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this,
Alone but now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

You left me broken like a record
Baby, I'm hurt and I don't want to play anymore
Missed every sign
Believed ever lie
And I was waiting for more

I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up
Baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know what it's done

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this,
Alone but now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

You took my heart off my sleeve
But now I'm taking it back, back
Baby, here I come
You took advantage of me
I don't appreciate that, that
You son of a gun

It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this,
Alone but now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
