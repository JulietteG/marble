Turn my back to the door 
Feel so much better now 
Dont even try anymore 
Nothin left to lose

As the voice thats in the air 
Sayin dont look back no where 
Theres a voice thats always there

And Ill never be quite the same as I was before 
This part of you still remains oh its out of focus

Your just somewhere that Ive been 
And I wont go back again 
Your just somewhere that Ive been
Im breathin in, breathin out 
Aint that what its all about? 
Livin life crazy loud

Like I have the right to 
No more words in my mouth 
Nothin left to figure out 
That I dont think Ill ever break through 
The ghost of you 
And Ill never be like I was the day I met you 
To naive? Yes I was 
Boy, thats why I let you in

Wear your memory like a stain 
Cant erase none of the pain 
Here to stay with me forever

Breathin in, breathin out 
Aint that what its all about? 
Livin life crazy loud

Like I have the right to 
No more words in my mouth 
Nothin left to figure out 
That I dont think Ill ever break through 
The ghost of you
One of these days 
Ill wake up from this bad dream Im dreamin 
One of these days I pray that Ill be, over,over,over you 
One of these days Ill realize that Im to tired of

Feelin confused 
But for now theres a reason 
That youre still here in my heart 
Breathin in, breathin out 
Aint that what its all about? 
Livin life crazy loud

Like I have the right to 
Know the words in my mouth 
Nothin left for me to doubt 
That I dont think Ill ever break through 
The ghost of you

Breathin in , breathin out 
Breathin in, breathin out 
Like I have the right to

No more words in my mouth 
Nothin left to figure out 
But I dont think Ill ever break through 
The the ghost of you---
