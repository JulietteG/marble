You've been riding this horse a long time
Why can't you find what you where looking for?
Always greener on the other side
Always believe there must be something more

Never stay very long anywhere
As the next girl you leave gets smaller
In you raer-view mirror

(Chorus)
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

If you tear her world apart
You have no regrets
If theres a key to your heart
No one has found it yet

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

Your reputaton's gettin out of control
I can believe, she believe's one word you say
Before I let you take my girlfriend home
I've got to warn her about the price on your head

It must feel so alone out there
Always running away from someone
But you get nowhere

(Chorus)
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

If you tear her world apart
You have no regrets
If theres a key to your heart
No one has found it yet

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

(Bridge)
I'm from the Lone Star State
I'm ready to bring you in
(Oh..)

I'm gonna see your face make you pay for all of your sins
Oh...Oh, oh

You've been riding this horse a long time
Ive had my eye on you all night
Im gonna find a way to make you mind
I know, even though

(Chorus)
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

If you tear her world apart
You have no regrets
If theres a key to your heart
No one has found it yet

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love
