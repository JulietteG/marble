I picked you out of in a crowd
Of a thousand faces
Yeah, I found you, oo, oo, oo
I chose the whys and the whens
All around and places
Yeah, I chose you, oo, oo, oo

I let you see me
Let you believe it was your move
So smooth, my rules

(Chorus)
Well, you think you are the one
Who got me, boy
No, I got U
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got U
I got U
I got U

You'd be surprised all the
Times that I almost told you
But I stayed cool, ohhh
I almost broke, but
I knew I would get to hold you
Cause I'm no fool, ohhh

You came back to me
And did the very thing I knew
That you'd do, oh oo oh

(Chorus)
Well, you think you are the one
Who got me, boy
No, I got U
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got U
I got U

You gave me all control
(I got U)
I took your heart and soul
(I got U)
For me, I'm gonna roll
I got U, you, you, ooo

(I got U, ohh yeah)
(I got U, and I love it)
(I got U)
(Yeah, I got U)
(I got U, and I love it)
(I got U)
(Yeah, I got U)

(Chorus)
Well, you think you are the one
Who got me, boy
No, I got U
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got U
I got U

(I got U, and I love it)
(I got U)
(Yeah, I got U)
(I got U, and I love it)
(I got U)
(Yeah, I got U)---Lyrics submitted by Chan.
