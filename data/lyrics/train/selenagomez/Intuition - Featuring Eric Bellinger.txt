I feel like im walking in the sky
whoa oh, whoa oh
Yesterday's tears were in my eyes
whoa oh, whoa oh

What a bad day, yeah ive been there before
but i keep my head up so i dont have those anymore
i made a choice, to be the best that i can ever be
gotta stay positive, ignore the negativity

I'm gonna follow my Intuition, tellin my self to listen
Everything's gonna be okay, it's gonna be a good day
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
it's gonna be a good day
follow my intuition, it's gonna be a good day

I gotta go with what feels right
whoa oh, whoa oh dont know
his native reason why?
whoa oh, whoa oh

whats the problem, compared to weight of the world?
Quite trying, to please every man, women, boy and girl
better pick up the pace, there aint no time to waste
tomorrow's never promised, so start living for today

I'm gonna follow my intuition, tellin myself to listen
Everything's gonna be ok, it's gonna be
a good day, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
it's gonna be a good day
follow my intuition
it's gonna be a good day

All i know is that i just gotta let go
gelic come back it;s always easy to know
sometimes it just gets so confusing feel 
like i dont know what im doing

but i trust in my heart, and in the end
it turns out that we are better than anything 
see whats meant to be is gonna happen
You knwo it's gonna be a good day

i'm gonna follow my intuition

i said it's gonna be a good day

Everything's gonna be ok!
it's gonna be a good day
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
it's gonna be a good day
follow my intuition
it's gonna be a good day 

oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh   
it's gonna be a good day

Follow My Intuition!---Lyrics submitted by valerie.
