You know fairytales don't come true
Not when it comes to you
Open up for the first time
And you can bet that it's the last time

And I'm cool with laying low
Saturday night, and I'm staying home
I'm feeling good for the first time
It's been a while since the last time

I'll wave goodbye when you say hello
Woah

I'm sick of the sleepless never ending nights
I just don't care who was wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumors and the alibis
You tear me up
I'll cut you down to size
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all the girls by your side
What you don't know 
Is how great it feels to let you go

I cracked your game, it's so see through
You know I'm way too good for you
Moving on to the next time
Drop the baggage and I'll be fine

When it's time to reminisce
You're gonna realize you miss this
You're on my mind for the last time
And at the most, you were a past time

I'll wave goodbye when you say hello
Woah

I'm sick of the sleepless never ending nights

I just don't care who was wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumors and the alibis
You tear me up
I'll cut you down to size
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of feeling bad by your side
What you don't know 
Is how great it feels to let you go

I'm happier alone
Taking down your pictures
And I'll throw those memories out the door
I'm sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies

I'm sick of the sleepless never ending nights
I just don't care who was wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumors and the alibis
You tear me up
I'll cut you down to size
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
So sick of you
So sick of you
So I'm getting on with my life

So sick of you
So sick of you
So sick of you
Oh woah
So sick of you
So sick of you
So sick of you
Oh woah

What you don't know 
Is how great it feels 
To let you go---Lyrics submitted by lexi.
