Can you feel me
When I think about you
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place

Like I've been wonderin the desert
For a thousand days (oooh)
Don't know if it's a mirage
But I always see your face, Baby

[Chorus:]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help that im in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how Ill survive
But a day without you is like a year without rain (oooh) whooo

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind (voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me calling
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean is running dry
Catch me I'm falling

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me
There's gonna be a monsoon
when you get back to me (ooooh Baby)

[Chorus]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help that im in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how Ill survive
a day without you is like a year without rain (oooh) whooo

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
and i need you here, i cant explain
the day without you 
is like a year without rain (oooh)

[Chorus]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help that im in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how Ill survive
a day without you is like a year without rain (oooh) whooo
hoooo (ooooo)---Lyrics submitted by adriana.
