Hey! Hey! Hey!
La La La La La
Hey! Hey! Hey!
La La La La La

Selena:
You come from here 
I come from there

Demi:
You rock out in your room 
I rock a world premier

Selena:
we're more alike than anybody could ever tell

Demi: 
Friday we're cool Monday we're freaks


Selena: 
sometimes we rule
sometimes we can't even speak

Demi:
But we can get up, let loose and lol

Selena:
it may seem cliche for me to wanna say, that your not alone

Demi:
and you can call me uncool but its a simple fact 
I got your back

yeah, yeah, yeah

Both:
Cuz we're one and the same 
we're anything but ordinary 
we're one and the same
I think we're almost legendary
you and the perfect team chasing down the dream
we're one the same

Hey! Hey! Hey!
La La La La La

Demi: 
I'm kinda like you 
you're kinda like me

Selena:
We write the same song in a different key

Both: 
It's got a rhythm you and me can get along

Selena: and it may seem cliche for me to wanna say that your not alone

Demi:
and you can call uncool but its a simple fact I still got your back

Selena:(I Still got your back)

Both:
Cuz we're one and the same 
we're anything but ordinary
one and the same
I think we're almost legendary
you and me the perfect team, shaking up the scene
we're one the same

Selena:
we're one and the same

Demi: 
We're anything but ordinary 

Selena: 
One and the same

Demi:
We're something more than momentary

Selena:
Cuz were one 
YEAHHH
cuz we're one 

demi: 
we're anything but ordinary

Both:
you and me, the perfect team
chasing down the dream
Oh
you and me the perfect team
shaking up the scene
We're one and the same

Hey! Hey! Hey!
