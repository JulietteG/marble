Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
its so hard to break it
there's no way to fake it

everybody tells me that it's wrong what i'm feeling
i shouldn't believe in
the dreams that i'm dreaming

i hear it everyday
i hear it all the time
it's never gonna amount to much 
but they're never gonna change my mind
oh
Chorus
Tell me tell me tell me somthin 
i don't know somthin 
i don't know  somthin i don't know
Tell me tell me tell me somthin
 i don't know somthin
 i don't know  somthin i don't know
Like how many inches in a mile 
what it take to make you simle
getcha not to treat me like a child 
baby 
Tell me tell me tell me somthin 
i don't know somthin 
i don't know  somthin i don't know
Tell me tell me tell me somthin
 i don't know somthin 
i don't know  somthin i don't know
(end of chorus)
everbody is tells i don't know what im doing
 this life pursuin 
the odds are blozzin
everbody tells me its that its 1 in a million (no) 
1 in a billion (oh) 
one in a ZILLION 
i hear it everyday
i hear it all the time
it's never gonna amount to much 
but they're never gonna change my mind
NO
Chorus
 yeah im ready for it   yeah im ready for it 
Im on my way i know im gonna get there someday 
it dosen't help when you say it will be EASY
