Another year went by 
Oh I need this time 
To unravel like these lights 
That all hang outside 
We made it through just fine 
Though a part has died 
But up from its ashes grew a tree 
With the star that lit the night 

I will lie in the snow 
And melt all of the cold 
With a burning fire in my soul 

Because nothing turns me to stone 
Cold as the winter is 
And makes me feel alright each Christmas time 

And Ill count the photos 
In the hallway of my family that have passed 
The stories through the evening keep us smiling 
Hurts less if we can laugh 

I will lie in the snow 
And melt all of the cold 
With a burning fire in my soul 

Because nothing turns me to stone 
Cold as the winter is 
And makes me feel alright each Christmas time 

No, nothing turns me to stone 
Cold as the winter is 
And makes me feel alright each Christmas time 

Each Christmas time 
Each Christmas time 
Each Christmas time 
Each Christmas time---
