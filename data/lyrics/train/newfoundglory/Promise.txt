im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say
i know they dont sound the way i planned them to be
but if you wait around a while il make you fall for me
i promise
i promise you i will

if you need a friend,
dont look to a stranger
you know in the end,
il always be there
and when your in doupt
and when your in danger
take a look all around
and il be there

im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say
(i promise you)
i know they dont sound the way i planned them to be
(i promise you)
but if you wait around a while il make you fall for me
(i promise you)
i promise
i promise you i will

when your day is through
and so is your temper
you know what to do
im gonna always be there
sometimes if i shout
(if i shout)
its not whats intended
these words just come out
with no grip to bear

im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say
(i promise you)
i know they dont sound the way i planned them to be
(i promise you)
but if you wait around a while il make you fall for me
(i promise you)
i promise
i promise you
im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say
(i promise you)
i know they dont sound the way i planned them to be
(i promise you)
if i had to walk the world id make you fall for me
i promise you
i promise you i will

gotta tell ya
need to tell ya
gotta tell ya
i gotta tell ya

im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say
(i promise you)
i know they dont sound the way i planned them to be
(i promise you)
but if you wait around a while il make you fall for me
i promise 
i promise you
im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say
(i promise you)
i know they dont sound the way i planned them to be
(i promise you)
if i had to walk the world id make you fall for me
i promise you
i promise you i will
i will
(i will)
i will
(i will)
(i will)
