I'm sorry 
I heard about the bad news today
A crowd of people around you 
Telling you it's okay
And everything happens for a reason

When you lose a part of your self
To somebody you know
It takes a lot to let go
Every breath that you remember
Pictures fade away but memory is forever

An empty chair at all the tables
And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down
But it's better where you're going anyway

I'm sorry 
I heard about the bad news today
It's really hard to get through
Tough times and long days
But it really just depends on the season

For now we'll say goodbye 
We know it's not the last time
I've lost the best part of my day
But it's better where you're going anyway

This is the last thing
I will remember 
It's better where you're going anyway---Lyrics submitted by Connor.
