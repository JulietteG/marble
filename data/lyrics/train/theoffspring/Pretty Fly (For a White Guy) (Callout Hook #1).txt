Give it to me baby, uh-huh, uh-huh
Give it to me baby, uh-huh, uh-huh
Give it to me baby, uh-huh, uh-huh
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy

You know it's kind of hard
Just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool 
But he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue
And he may not have style
But everthing he lacks
Well he makes up in denial

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
He's gonna play the field and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabe's
Hey, hey do that brand new thing

Give it to me baby, uh-huh, uh-huh
Give it to me baby, uh-huh, uh-huh
Give it to me baby, uh-huh, uh-huh
And all the girlies say I'm pretty fly for a white guy

He needs some cool tunes
Not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube
So he bought Vanilla Ice
Now crusin' in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice they're gonna kick his lily ass

So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
He's gonna play the field and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate just overcompensate
At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world loves wannabe's
Hey, hey do that brand new thing

Now he gettin' a tattoo
Yeah he's gettin' ink done
He asked for a '13' but they drew a '31'
Friends say he's trying too hard
And he's not quite hip
But in his own mind
He's the, he's the dopest trip

Give it to me baby uh-huh, uh-huh
Give it to me baby uh-huh, uh-huh
Give it to me baby uh-huh, uh-huh

So don't debate
A player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
He's gonna play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabe's
The world loves wannabe's
So let's get some more wannabe's
Hey, hey do that brand new thing---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
