Deep inside your soul, there's a hole
You don't want to see
Every single day, what you say
Makes no sense to me
Even though I try
I can't get my head around you

Somewhere in the night, there's a light
In front of me
Heaven up above, with a shove 
Abandons me
And even though I try
I fall in the river of you
You manage to bring me down too

All your faking
Shows your aching

Every single day, what you say
Makes no sense to me
Letting you inside isn't right
Cause you'll mess with me
I never really know
What's really going on inside you
I can't get my head around you

All your feeding
Shows you're bleeding

Deep inside your soul, there's a hole
You don't want to see
You're covering it up, like a cut
With the likes of me
You know I've really tried
I can't do any more about you

The cut's getting deeper
The hill's getting steeper
I guess I'll never know
What's really going on inside you
I can't get my head around you
I can't get my head around you
I can't get my head around you
I can't get my head around you---Lyrics submitted by Shazza.
