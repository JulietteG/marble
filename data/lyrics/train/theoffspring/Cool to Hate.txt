I hate a lot of things,
I hate a lot of people that are lame.

I like to hate stuff
'Cause then I don't have to try and make a change

I hate the teachers,
I hate school,
I hate the the cheerleaders
And anyone who's cool
I hate the office
I hate the quad
Don't wanna learn nothing
I want to be a slob 

It's cool to hate,
It's cool to hate,
I don't like nothing and I like that fine.
It's cool to hate,
It's cool to hate,
I don't like nothing and I like that fine,
I don't like nothing and I like that fine,
Yeah I hate everything
I even hate you too
So fuck you

I'm always thinking bad
 I never have nothing good to say,
I'd rather tear things down
 than build them up,
It's easier that way,

I hate the jocks and,
I hate the geeks,
I hate the trendies,
But I also hate the freaks yeah.
I hate Doc Martens,
And Muscle Tee's,
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery,

It's cool to hate,
It's cool to hate,
Liking something's just a waste of time,
It's cool to hate,
It's cool to hate,
Liking something's just a waste of time,
Liking something's just a waste of time,
Yeah, I hate everything
 I even hate me too
So fuck you

It's cool to hate,
It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate

I'll cut you down and give you lip,
Being positive's so unhip,
I'll cut you down cause I'm a fool,
Being positive's so uncool,


I hate the jocks and,
I hate the geeks,
I hate the trendies,
But I also hate the freaks yeah.
I hate your band
And I hate T.V.
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery.

It's cool to hate,
It's cool to hate,
Don't like nothing and I like that fine,
It's cool to hate,
It's cool to hate,
Don't like nothing and I like that fine,
Don't like nothing and I like that fine,
Yeah, I hate everything
I even hate you too
So fuck you---Lyrics submitted by Chance.
