Head over heels I've fit in before,
now, I don't want to do it no more.
I've held it all in with blood on my face,
built it up man so bad you can taste.

I don't slag no one,
I don't even judge.
Don't give a shit cause I'm not gonna budge.
I just want to be who I want to be,
Guess that's hard for others to see.

I'm not a trendy asshole.
I do what I want,
I do what I feel like.
I'm not a trendy asshole.
I don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you.
Cause I'm alive.

Smash is the way you feel all alone,
like an outcast you're out on your own.
Smash is the way you deal with your life,
like an outcast you're smashing your strife.

Head over heels I've fit in before,
now, I don't want to do it no more.
I just want to be who I want to be,
guess that's hard for the others to see.

I'm not a trendy asshole.
I do what I want,
I do what I feel like.
I'm not a trendy asshole.
I don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you.
'Cause I'm alive.

Head over heels I've fit in before,
now, I don't want to do it no more.
I just want to be who I want to be,
guess that's hard for the others to see.

I'm not a trendy asshole.
I do what I want,
I do what I feel like.
I'm not a trendy asshole.
I don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you.

I'm not a trendy asshole.
I do what I want,
I do what I feel like.
I'm not a trendy asshole.
I don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you,
'Cause I'm alive.
I am alive.
I am alive.
I am alive.---Lyrics submitted by cathy.
