You brace and hold it all inside
Its more than you can stand
No one around even tries
Tries to understand

Dont turn away, dont turn away
Come out swinging
Come out alone
Theyre in your way
But as long as youre swinging
Strong then youll get by

Your pacings wearing out a line
Right beside your bed
The scene replays a million times
Stuck inside your head

And though you stand in place
Your mind escapes
Read between the lies
Smiles on your face
You fake like youre ok

Dont turn away, dont turn away
Come out swinging
Out on your own
Theyre in your way
You may be stinging
But youll get by
Dont turn away, dont turn away
Come out swinging
Never alone again
The pain inside can guide your way

Midnight, no sleep
Inside, you scream to
No one, hears you fall
Daylight, prove me today
One more try

Dont turn away, dont turn
Come out swinging
Come out alone
Theyre in your way
You may be stinging
But youll get by
Don?t turn away, dont turn away
Come out swinging
Never alone again
Pain inside
Leads you through so youll get by---Lyrics submitted by liz.
