If you could only read my mind
You would know that things between us
Ain't right
I know your arms are open wide
But you're a little on the straight side
I can't lie 

Your one vice
It's you're too nice
Come around now can you see 

I want you 
All tattooed
I want you bad 

Complete me
Mistreat me
want you to be bad bad bad bad bad

If you could only read my mind
You would know that I've been waiting
So long
Someone almost just like you
But with attitude, I'm waiting
so come on 

Get out of clothestime
Grow out those highlights
Come around now can't you see 

I want you
In a vinyl suit
I want you bad 

Complicated
X-rated
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad

Don't get me wrong
I know you're only being good
But that's what's wrong
I guess I just misunderstood 

Go!

I want you
All tattooed
I want you bad

Complicated
X-rated
I want you bad 

I mean it
I need it
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, really really bad---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
