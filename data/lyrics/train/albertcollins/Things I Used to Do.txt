Thing that I used to do
Lord, I don't do no more
The thing that I used to do
Lord, I don't do no more
I used to sit and hold your hand
Beggin' you to not to go

Searched all night for you, darlin'
Lord, and my search was in vain
Oh, I searched all night for you, baby
And babe you know, my search was in vain
Well, and I knew all the time
You was hid out wit' your other man

Well, I'm goin' to send you back to your mama
Lord, I'm goin' back to my family too
Oh, goin' to send you back to your mama
Lord, I'm goin' back to my family too
Oh, you know I just can't stand
Oh, this low down way you do---
