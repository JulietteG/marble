Ive got a cold, cold feelin; Its just like ice around my heart. 
Ive got a cold, cold feelin; Its just like ice around my heart. 
I know Im gonna quit somebody, every time that, feelinstarts. 

You treat my like a prisoner, because my hands are tied. 
Everything you do to me, is stackin up inside. 
Its a cold, cold feelin Yea, Youre just like ice around my heart. 
I know Im gonna quit somebody, every time that, feelinstarts. 

Theres a change in me baby, once I was blind but now I can see. 
Theres a change in me baby, once I was blind but now I can see. 
Im gonna put everybody down baby, 
That ever made a fool outta me.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
