We're killing space and wasting time and dying hard and spilling beans
We're moving fast on intuition in the world of stupid things
We are the flyers no return and no regrets and no delay
Into the frenzy this is crazy burning wheels to get away

Time of the moon in the sky cloud is breaking
Voice of the doom for the birds in the making

The time is wasted
On intuition
We are the flyers
Into the frenzy
We're spilling bids
On stupid things
With no delay
We get away

Time of the moon in the sky cloud is breaking
Voice of the doom for the birds in the making

No destination is the way we're talking of accelerate
Get rid of garbage, yes you may they draw the bridge but it's too late
We are the final revelation shooting through the burning sky
Abandoned cargo hits the ground on broken wings we are flying high.---Lyrics submitted by ezequiel.
