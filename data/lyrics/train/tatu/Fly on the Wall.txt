When you're naked in the shower
When you're sleeping for an hour
When you're big, when you're small
Oh, I wish i was a fly on the wall

When you're with her after midnight
When you kiss her in the dim light
When you break, Barbie doll
Oh, I wish i was a fly on the wall

Wanna see who you are
Every inch, every scar

From your head to your toes
I would be there
From your bed to your clothes
I'm in the air

When you think you're alone
I'll be down the hall
I could see it if I was a fly on the wall
What you do in your room
I could see it all
You undress, I wish I was a fly on the wall, yeah, yeah (Break)

For the drama that you're drinking
And the dark thoughts you are thinking
And the love notes that you scroll
Oh, I wish I was a fly on the wall

Silently I arrive
You don't know I'm alive

From your head to your toes
I would be there
From your bed to your clothes
I'm in the air

When you think you're alone
I'll be down in the hall
I could see it, if I was a fly on the wall
What you do in your room
I could see it all
You undress, I wish I was a fly on the wall, yeah, yeah
Wish I was a fly on the wall yeah, yeah, yeah

Ever closer, ever nearer
When you're looking in the mirror
I would know who you call
If I was a fly on the wall
ooo ah ah

From your head to your toes
I would be there
From your bed to your clothes
I'm in the air

When you think you're alone
I'll be down in the hall
I could see it, if I was a fly on the wall
What you do in your room
I could see it all
You undress, I wish I was a fly on the wall, yeah, yeah
Wish i was a fly on the wall yeah, yeah, yeah

From your head to your toes
I would be there
From your bed to your clothes
I'm in the air
What you do on your own
I could see it all
When you think you're alone
I would crawl

When you think you're alone
I'll be down in the hall
I could see it, if I was a fly on the wall
What you do in your room
I could see it all
You undress, I wish I was a fly on the wall, yeah, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Joey.
