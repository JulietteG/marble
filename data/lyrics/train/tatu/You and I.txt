You and I
Holding tight
You and I
Gotta fight
You and I
Side by side
You and I
Sanctified

You and I
Feels so right
You and I
Holding tight
You and I
Side by side
You and I
For the rest of our lives

Every night
We're all alone every night
My only hope is a light
That's shining from inside you

'Cause we believe
In what we are you believe
In what we'll be in this dream
So I can stand beside you

No truths to confirm
No lies to deny
Too hopeless to care,
We're too scared to cry

You and I
Holding tight
You and I
Gotta fight
You and I
Side by side
You and I
Sanctified

You and I
Feels so right
You and I
Holding tight
You and I
Side by side
You and I
For the rest of our lives

Cast aside
To an endless street we recess
For what believe we will hide
Maybe we can make it through this

Is it fair,
To run away,
Is it fair to belive this, we're victimized
For a life we didn't ask for

No truths to confirm
No lies to deny
Too hopeless to care,
we're too scared to cry

You and I      Holding tight  
You and I      Gotta fight
You and I      Side by side   
You and I      Sanctified

You and I      Feels so right 
You and I      Holding tight
You and I      Side by side  
You and I       For the rest of our lives

You and I       Holding tight  
You and I       Gotta fight
You and I       Side by side
You and I       Sanctified

You and I       Feels so right 
You and I       Holding tight
You and I       Side by side   
You and I       For the rest of our lives---Lyrics submitted by MJ.
