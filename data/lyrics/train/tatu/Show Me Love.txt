Allo
Allo
Vidish' veter
Nu i chto
Posmotri v okno
Nu i chto
A vchera bylo solntse
Nu i chto
Zachem ty vse vremya govorish' odno i tozhe
A ya avtootvetchik

This was an accident
Not the kind where sirens sound
Never even noticed
We're suddenly crumbling
Tell me how you've never felt
Delicate or innocent
Do you still have doubts that
Us having faith makes any sense

Tell me nothing ever counts
Lashing out or breaking down
Still somebody loses 'cause
There's no way to turn around
Staring at your photograph
Everything now in the past
Never felt so lonely I
Wish that you could show me love

Show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Till you open the door
Show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Till I'm up off the floor
Show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Till it's inside my pores
Show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Till I'm screaming for more

Random acts of mindlessness
Commonplace occurrences
Chances and surprises
Another state of consciousness
Tell me nothing ever counts
Lashing out or breaking down
Still somebody loses 'cause
There's no way to turn around

Tell me how you've never felt
Delicate or innocent
Do you still have doubts that
Us having faith makes any sense
You play games, I play tricks
Girls and girls, but you're the one
Like a game of pick-up-sticks
Played by fuckin' lunatics

Show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Till you open the door
Show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Till I'm up off the floor
Show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Till it's inside my pores
Show me love, show me love, show me love
Show me love, show me love
Till I'm screaming for more

Show me love, show me love
Give me all that I want
Show me love, show me love
Give me all that I want
Show me love, show me love
Give me all that I want
Show me love, show me love
Till I'm screaming for more

Mama, Papa - forgive me---Lyrics submitted by myrddyn.
