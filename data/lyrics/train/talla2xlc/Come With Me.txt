Come with me,
This aint no dead end street.
Can't you see,
The place where spirits meet?

Come with me...

What does the future look like:
Is it black or white?
Don't you think too much about it,
What is wrong or right?

I see you at the other side

Come with me,
This aint no dead end street.
Can't you see,
The place where spirits meet?

Come with me...

Take my hand and let me guide you
Through the twilight zone.
Just believe in a hour of yourself;
You're not alone

Don't you make it all your own?

Come with me,
This aint no dead end street.
Can't you see,
The place where spirits meet?

Come with me...---
