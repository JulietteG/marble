A contribution made
A man-made self brigade
An imposition of that's dwelled
And hospitality far from reality
Casts neglecting yourself
And in the process of these lies
Heroes never live, legends never die

Preserve one's self, in safety for growth
Preserve one's self
Preserve one's self, in safety for growth
Preserve one's self

Finding strength in yourself
A massacre of your dignity
A fortune for someone else
Inspired by insufficiency
Interrogation and hypocrisy
Inspired by insufficiency
Interrogation and hypocrisy
And in this world full of lies
Heroes never live, legends never die
A masquerade
A disposition of everything that you believe
A front put for success
Only one could see
Only one can see

Preserve one's self in safety for growth
Preserve one's self in safety for growth
Preserve one's self in safety for growth
Preserve one's self in safety for growth
Why kill a dream?
Why kill a dream?
Feed off the weakness of your kind
Feed off the weakness for your prime---Lyrics submitted by Reese.
