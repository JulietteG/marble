A mass suppression depressed by life unsure what he's to live for.
But then away came the better days when life opened its new doors.
Struggling for a way every day to live life not to fail but succeed.
Over coming on overwhelming load of power and greed.

Break the chains!
That grab ones soul!
Break These Chains!
That Take Control!
Break These Chains!

Wasting all that's left of a day, watching time just fly away on his own.
Dreams are surpassing him by, why not live life to its fullest and give it a try!
How much will does one simply have to conquer what he's become?
And how many others can say my fears have become phobias!

How much should one take for granted?
He's changed by life in order to see that he can succeed!
And how can you?

We'll Break The Chains!
We'll Break The Chains!

A mass suppression depressed by life unsure what he's to live for.
But then away came the better days when life opened its new doors.
Struggling for a way every day to live life not to fail but succeed!

Overcome!

I will believe!
I will believe!
I will believe!
I will succeed!---Lyrics submitted by Jake.
