(talking) 
its so perfect tonite
you and me alone, stay naked
come here, stay butnaked 

{chorus}
im sit'n here lookin at ya body baby baby baby
ive never seen somethin so beautiful here lately lately lately
i love the way the candles bringin out your skin tone baby baby baby
dont ever put your clothes again on stay butnaked baby baby baby

{hook}
i love the way you sound 
when i let you in
that sweet low moanin

{chorus}
im sit'n here lookin at ya body baby baby baby
ive never seen somethin so beautiful here lately lately lately
i love the way the candles bringin out your skin tone baby baby baby
dont ever put your clothes on again stay butnaked baby baby baby

{verse 2}
the neighbors gonna damn sure hear us tonite
i know ya gonna do some eatin at my table tonite
your bodys so bangin you dont need no protection tonite
(damn did i just say that, i guess i did, lets do this)

{chorus}
im sit'n here lookin at ya body baby baby baby
ive never seen somethin so beautiful here lately lately lately
i love the way the candles bringin out your skin tone baby baby baby
dont ever put your clothes again on stay butnaked baby baby baby

{hook}
i love the way you sound when i let you in
that sweet low moanin
(the way your lookin at me, does somethin to me)
