A light in my eyes,
Crystally morning is definately... 
in my room
Hands to the sky,
My heart is open like a flower
in full bloom...

So clean and so pure
You are with me 
that's for sure
Good, good morning...My Lord
This day...I live for you

Breakfast in bed... 
my heart is feasting 
on the bread and the butter
of your word
Now that I'm fed,
ready to give of the treasures
that I heard...

Use me this day
So others can say
Good Good Morning
My Lord
This day I live for you!


Use me this day
So others can say
Good Good Morning
My Lord
This day I live for you!---Lyrics submitted by tonty.
