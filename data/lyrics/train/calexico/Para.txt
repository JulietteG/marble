I hold your wrist
You bite your lip
The push becomes an embrace

I touch your face
You close your eyes
The embrace becomes a shove

I walk away
You follow too close
The shove takes hold
And there's no where to go

Take it down
Take it all the way
Take it down
Take it all the way down below the waterline

I see you now
Through a glass wall
All that is you stays with you
All that is me stays with me
But we see it all
We feel it all
And there is no place we can't go

Take it down
Take it all the way
Take it down
Take it all the way down below the waterline---Lyrics submitted by ozhan ertekin.
