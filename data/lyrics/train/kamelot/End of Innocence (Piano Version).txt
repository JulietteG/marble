Tell me do you remember
The games and the laughter?
Far from the choices we'd have to make
A kiss on the lips
Turned the toad to a prince
And the end was a lifetime away

I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember me...

It's the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence

Now it's me and my knife
And my will is my temple
Numb from the choices I have to make
Slowly we all took a bite of the apple
And laughter's a lifetime away
Remember me...

I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember me...

It's the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence

Of innocence...
Where do we go from here?

It's the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence---
