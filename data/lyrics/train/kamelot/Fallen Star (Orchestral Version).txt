You are my reason to stay
Even if daylights a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes the weight of the worlds
Coming over me
A feeling I cant forget
Sometimes I find myself caught in a storm
And my futures a nightmare away
When Im dreaming

Sometimes I fear
I am losing your sympathies
A liar demands respect
Sometimes I fell I am losing control
And feed on the absence of love

Walking this world like animals
And into the light were fading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylights a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes Im lost in the silence of empathy
A moment I cant reflect
Sometimes I feel like Im loosing control
And feed on the essence of hate

Walking this world like animals
And into the dark were wading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylights a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Somewhere in time
A story seldom told
Somewhere in history
Our destiny behold

In the dead of the night Im just a corpse
Awoken the enemy sleeping inside
In the eye of the storm were just the same

'cause you are my reason to stay
Even if daylights a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven
My song for the lost
My song for the children unforgiven---
