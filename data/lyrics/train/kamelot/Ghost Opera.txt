Walls so white
Where your sorrows have a name
And day is dark as night
There's no remorse and no redemption

Close the door
Can you hear the crowd is waiting?
For a last encore
Screaming out for my attention

Chanting my name

[CHORUS]
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra
Like a crescendo of gratitude
This is my song

Like the dead
I am on the other side
They're howling in my head
There's no remorse and no redemption

Hush my dear
Let the music fill the night
And soon it's all we hear
Screaming out for my attention

Chanting my name
Chanting my name

[CHORUS]
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra
Like a crescendo of gratitude

Don't wake me
Until it's over
I, I may be dreaming
And awake

[Solo]

Chanting my name
Chanting my name

[CHORUS]
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra

Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra---Lyrics submitted by Micky.
