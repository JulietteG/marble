I wait to surface
Above these bellowed growls
To sweep the shallows of utopia
I am the anchor
And the rope around your feet
In a river deep I hold you down

Ive come to stage your abdication
Im the creation of your sins
Embrace me

When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep

In the center
Of your greed infected wounds
I am a thorn of endless sorrow
Just one of thousands
In your self selected crown
A king to wallow in the mire
And roll in defeat

I will protect the incubation
I am your bottomless decease
Embrace me

When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep

Pater noster
Invidia
Ira gula
Superbia acedia
Luxuria
Avaritia
Pater parce meis peccatis

All I see
Is mine to take
To have and to hold
To suffocate
All I want
Is mine to keep
And I want it all
So father forgive me

When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep---
