There's a pain within
That I can't define
There's an empty space
Where your love used to shine

From the night we met
Till the day you died
Do you think I wished?
Do you still believe I tried?

All too soon we were divided 
And life had just begun

Will you revive from the chaos in my mind 
Where we still are bound together?
Will you be there waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever?

I belong to you
You belong to me
It's the way things are
Always meant to be

Like the morning star
And the rising sun
You convey my life
And forgive me what I've done

All too soon we were divided
In the darkness and light

Will you revive from the chaos in my mind
Where we still are bound together?
Will you be there waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever? 

Save me
Reverse how I'm thinking of you
Every breath I take bring me closer
Closer to forever, to you
I'm waiting for the day that I'm gone

All too soon we were divided
And life had just begun

Will you revive from the chaos in my mind
Where we still are bound together?
Will you be there waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever?
Will you be there waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever?---Lyrics submitted by Lotte.
