I opened my lungs
To breathe in forgiveness & love
Haunting me now
Reminders of how
I used to be

And on down the road
My troubles are sure to follow
But looking out the window
Hell if I know 
Where I would go
So I'll just keep on driving

On my way to L.A.
Looking into the rearview
As the roads fade away
I swored off my past
The first and last bad call that I ever made

And tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line just changed my mind
And guess my heart I'll follow this time

Who would've known
That pride is too hard to swallow
As I rest on the shoulder
Of a road growin' colder
With the trouble I own
Should I just keep on drivin'?

On my way to L.A.
Looking into the rearview
As the roads fade away
I swored off my past
The first and last bad call that I ever made

And tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line just changed my mind
Well it's my heart I'll follow this time

(bridge)
I know I must be doing something right
Head the other way
Back to where I started out
Ask myself if I can turn it all around tonight
And stop living with doubt
Yeah...

On my way to L.A.
Looking into the rearview
As the roads fade away
I swored off my past
The first and last bad call that I ever made

And tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line just changed my mind
Well it's my heart I'll follow this time

I swored off my past
The first and last bad call that I ever made
Well it's my heart I'll follow this time
I swored off my past
The first and last bad call that I ever made
I'm gonna turn it all around tonight
Turn it all around tonight
Turn it all around tonight
I'm gonna turn it all around tonight
At the Tennessee line---Lyrics submitted by Lloyd.
