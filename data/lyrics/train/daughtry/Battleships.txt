I'm sinking inside
And the masts and lines are broken down tonight
I've swallowed my pride
But we're drowning in the ocean
And it's tearing my heart open baby

We're high, then we're low
First it's yes then it's no
And we're changing like the tides
But I want you, I need you
And I guarantee you we'll make it out alive

'Cause I don't wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don't wanna see the day we say we've had enough
And I don't wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns
And we love like battleships
Like battleships

Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes

Bombs fly through the air
And I know that we're both playing not so fair
Show, show me you care
Got my white flag up and it's waving
'Cause you know this love's worth saving baby

We're high, then we're low
First it's yes then it's no
And we're changing like the tides
But I want you, I need you
And I guarantee you we'll make it out alive

'Cause I don't wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don't wanna see the day we say we've had enough
And I don't wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns
And we love like battleships
Like battleships

Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom

And we love, yeah we love
(Boom boom boom b-boom)
And we love, yeah we love
(Boom boom boom b-boom)

I'm sinking inside
Can we finally put our weapons down tonight?

'Cause I don't wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don't wanna see the day we say we've had enough
And I don't wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns
And we love like battleships
Like battleships

Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom boom boom b-boom
We love like battleships---
