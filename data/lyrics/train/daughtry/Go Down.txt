Say what you need to say
Say, say it when I'm gone
Stay if you need to stay
Stay, oh get ready to run

Time's running out on the clock
Tell me, what have you done?
Well I'm here, right here, when you're ready, when you're ready to come
Come

So get your freak on
Get your heels off the ground
Like a drum solo
Yeah it's about to go down
Now get your rocks off
Body move to the sound
Like an hour clock
Yeah it's about to go down
Down

Take, take it all the way
Take it all the way to the grave
Break, breaking all the rules
Just so you can come out and play

Time's running out on the clock
And I'm turning the page
Well I'm here, right here
Get you out, get you out of your cage
Cage

So get your freak on
Get your heels off the ground
Like a drum solo
Yeah it's about to go down
Now get your rocks off
Body move to the sound
Like an hour clock
Yeah it's about to go down
Yeah it's about to go down
Yeah it's about to go down
Yeah it's about to go down

Yeah it's about to go down
(Yeah it's about to go down)

So get your freak on
Well kick a hole in the sky
Like a drum solo
Yeah, it's about to go down
Now get your rocks off
Body move to the sound
Just like an hour clock
It's about to go down
Yeah it's about to go down
Yeah it's about to go down
Yeah it's about to go down
Yeah it's about to go down
Yeah it's about to go down
Down---
