I've been me,  i've been following my dreams
Tryin to find the scene where you believed me
I've been true, i've been waiting here for you
I've been patient, understanding, and believing

Every time you turn around
I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But i won't let you down
I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But i won't let you down
Every time you turn around, Yeah

I've been good, i've been doin what i should
Workin hard to make a world that we can live in
I've been strong, i've been holdin out so long
That i don't want you to forget you are forgiven

I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But i won't let you down
I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But i won't let you down 
Every time you turn around, Yeah

All the reasons you believe what you believe
Never seeing that the truth is a part of me
And all i wanna do is show you what it really means to love
What it really means to love

I know you're standing there waiting for me 
To take it on back down the other road baby
But i won't let you down
I see you're standing there waiting for me 
To take it on back down the other road baby
But i won't let you down
Every time you turn around x4---Lyrics submitted by tyler.
