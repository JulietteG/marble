I've been waiting for tomorrow to come
Another change it's seems like time erases,
reason's gone.
I've been waiting for something like a change
But well never, ever turn to better and

Once again
I'm drifting. I'm falling
Once again
You hold me down and nothing's time again
I'm drifting, I'm falling
Once again
It's like everything around me crush me down.

A revolution within the need to breathe
I got to run away as far as I can see.
With freedom will as gasoline
Coz' we will never change, never and

Once again
I'm drifting. I'm falling
Once again
You hold me down and nothing's time again
I'm drifting, I'm falling
Once again
It's like everything around me crush me down.---Lyrics submitted by Jules.
