Forgive, sounds good
Forget, Im not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But Im still waiting

Im through with doubt
Theres nothing left for me to figure out
Ive paid a price
And Ill keep paying

Im not ready to make nice
Im not ready to back down
Im still mad as hell and
I dont have time to go round and round and round
Its too late to make it right
I probably wouldnt if I could
Cause Im mad as hell
Cant bring myself to do what it is you think I should

I know you said
Cant you just get over it
It turned my whole world around
And I kind of like it

I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I dont mind sayin
Its a sad sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That theyd write me a letter
Sayin that I better shut up and sing
Or my life will be over

Im not ready to make nice
Im not ready to back down
Im still mad as hell and
I dont have time to go round and round and round
Its too late to make it right
I probably wouldnt if I could
Cause Im mad as hell
Cant bring myself to do what it is you think I should

Im not ready to make nice
Im not ready to back down
Im still mad as hell and
I dont have time to go round and round and round
Its too late to make it right
I probably wouldnt if I could
Cause Im mad as hell
Cant bring myself to do what it is you think I should

What it is you think I should

Forgive, sounds good
Forget, Im not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But Im still waiting ---
