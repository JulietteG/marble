Along the sand, let's walk the shore together now
Yes hand in hand, it's gonna be fair weather now
When the stars come out, stop to count them in the sky

Love California nights
When I'm walkin' with you hand in hand by the shore
Yes, I love California nights
At the beach where we'd swim with the tide rolling in

And there will be beneath the midnight sky above
Just you and me and we will whisper words of love
While the fire light softly flickers in the sand

Warm California nights
With the breeze blowin' in, the time for love to begin
I would miss California nights if I went on my way
Thinkin' now that I'll stay

Ooh, baby
Love you, baby
Mm, baby

Love California nights
Always close as a kiss, nothing's sweeter than this
And we'll spend California nights
Always close as a kiss---
