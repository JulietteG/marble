I wish I lived in the Golden Age, giving it up on the Broadway stage. 
Hang with the rats and smoke cigars, have a break with Frank and count the stars. 
Dressed to the night, weve had to much. Shiny jewels, casino cash. 
Tapping feet, wanna take the lead. A trip back in time is all I need! 

Sing it out loud, gonna get back honey! 
Sing it out loud, get away with me! 
Sing it out loud, on a trip back honey! 
Sing it out loud and let yourself free! 

Im on my way, gonna make it big, gonna make the songs for the chicks to dig. 
Its really hot and a little bit sour, were getting your strength to maximum power. 
Flying away from reality, whatever ever happened to gravity? 
I see it clear, a shooting star! Im a really good singer la-di-da-da-da! 

Sing it out loud, gonna get back honey! 
Sing it out loud, get away with me! 
Sing it out loud, on a trip back honey! 
Sing it out loud and let yourself free! 2x 

Ooooh, Silver screen on a rainy day, sally balls in a cabaret. 
Shaking sticks, oh what a show, rushing joy from tip to toe. 
Rambling down the boulevard, with a fire burning in a wooden heart. 
My mind is set, I walked the line! 
But I never really thought it would feel this fine! Yeah! 

Sing it out loud, gonna get back honey! 
Sing it out loud, get away with me! 
Sing it out loud, on a trip back honey! 
Sing it out loud and let yourself free! 2x---Lyrics submitted by cool.
