Linda, when your eyes are cold
Do you remember who you cannot hold?
Are you living like you lost your will?
Do you surrender what you cannot feel
What you cannot feel
What you cannot feel

Linda, when your eyes are lights
Are you dreaming, are you lost in flight?
Are you buried in the darkest hole?
Will you surrender what you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control

Every time you turn around
You think someone will be there following you
But there ain't no one around
Just a past you can't see through
And a big sky getting ready to fall on you

Linda, you know you drink too much
And your friends are ones you've never even touched
When you're walking down that lonely hall
Will you surrender anything at all
Anything at all
Anything at all

What you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control
What you can't control

Every time you turn around
You think someone will be there following you
But there ain't no one around
Just a past you can't see through
And a big sky getting ready to fall on you---Lyrics submitted by Yanoff.
