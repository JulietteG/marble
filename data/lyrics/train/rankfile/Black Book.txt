King of the mountain, you thought you were the top of the heap
You like takin what other guys tried to keep
Heres a fact, its fair to warn ya
She bought a ticket to California
California
California

Chorus:
So look whos laughing now
Youd find out somehow
Babys got a black book
Your babys got a black book
Say, babys got a black book
Shes got a black book too

Alright

Check out the smile, behind your back shell turn around
Its such a gas to see somebody put you down
The way you treat her, how long you think youd hang around?
I watch your smile fallin to the ground
Fall to the ground
Fall to the ground

Chorus

Im in her black book
Its where I wanted to be, yeah
Im in her black book, on page number three
In that black book

The word is out, you dont believe it, but its true
How does it feel when she does what she does to you?
Its all been spent, youve nothin for a rainy day
How does it feel to hear all the people say
What she does to you
What she does to you?

Chorus

Thats right
Take a page from me
Do it, turn around
