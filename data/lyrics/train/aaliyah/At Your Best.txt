let me know 
let meknow 
Ah-ha let me know
let me know 
let me know  

when I feel 
what I feel
sometimes it's hard to tell you so
you may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know
there are times when I find
you wanna keep yourself from me
when I don't have the strength im just a mirror
of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a postive motivating force with in my life
Should you ever feel the need to
wonder why
let me know 
let me know

lo-oo-ve

let me know 

when you feel 
what you feel
ha-ha-hard for me to understand
so many things have taken place before this love affair began
but if you feel oh like I feel
confusion can give way to doubt
for there are times when I fall short of what I say
what I say what I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love 
You're a postive movating force with in my life 
Should you ever feel the need to
wonder why 
let me know
let me know

tell me what it is 
(tell me what it is)
theres no need to make believe
(make believe, no need to make believe)
look beyond your world
(look beyond your world)
try to find a place for me
(try to find, find a place for me)

'cause at your best your are love
You're a postive moviting force with in my life 
should you ever feel the need
to wonder why
let me know
let me know

let me know 
let me know 
let me know 
ohh ohhh ohhhh
Ah, hah, hah, hah
see, stay at you best baby---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
