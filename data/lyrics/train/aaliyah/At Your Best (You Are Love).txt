Let me know, let me know 
Ah - ha, let me know, let me know 
Let me know 

When I feel what I feel 
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so 
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know 

There are times when I find 
You want to keep yourself from me 
When I don't have the strength; I'm just a mirror of what I see 

But at your best you are love 
You're a positive motivating force within my life 
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why 
Let me know, let me know. . . 

When you feel what you feel 
Oh, how hard for me to understand 
So many things have taken place before this love affair began 

But if you feel, oh, like I feel 
Confusion can give way to doubt 
For there are times when I fall short of what I say, 
what I say I'm all about, all about 

Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is) 
There's no need to make believe 
Look beyond your own (Look beyond your own) 
Try and find another place for me 
Cause. . . 

Ah, ah, ah - ha 
See stay at your best baby ---
