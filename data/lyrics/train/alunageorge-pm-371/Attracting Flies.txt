Hold on now I'm choking
Give me a second to collect myself
You must be joking, otherwise I'm laughing to myself
Why you here again,
Hold on a minute, let me check this out
Your invitation's a fake, must from a take it out
I hear you out, hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm now stepping out
I hear you out, hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm now stepping out

[Chorus]
Let away fairy tales and, little white lies
Everything you exhale
Is attracting flies
And we can go off the wales and you can cry your eyes out
But everything you exhale is attracting flies

Please stay it's your moment
I'll give you all the listening that you need
Don't be so mean
Who needs the drama, who said you have to bleed
I'm excited, come on surprise me,
Sweep me off my feet
Oh enlight me, what is special think bout you I need
I hear you out, hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm now stepping out
I hear you out, hear me out
I hear you shout, I'm now stepping out

[Chorus]
Let away fairy tales and, little white lies
Everything you exhale
Is attracting flies
And we can go off the wales and you can cry your eyes out
But everything you exhale is attracting flies

How'd you think you know when you stop igniting
You know my heart right and you had me aching
How about a piece of your own medicine
Know you're outside there tryina get in
Baby, what would I care if you want me
Baby, what would I care if you don't
Baby, what would I care if you need me
Baby, what would I care if you don't

[Chorus]
Let away fairy tales and, little white lies
Everything you exhale
Is attracting flies
And we can go off the wales and you can cry your eyes out
But everything you exhale is attracting flies.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
