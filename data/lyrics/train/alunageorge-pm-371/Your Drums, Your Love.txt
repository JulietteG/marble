Your drums, we're drumming, your drums 
Your drums, we're drumming, your drums 

You can't say that I'm going no where 
Cause you don't know where I'm coming from 
And you can't say that I'm going no where 
When I have been trying to reach you for so long 

Your drums, we're drumming, your drums 

Friends say I've got something wrong, 
Cause I've been trying to reach you for so long. 
For so long, I've tried 
To reach you baby, don't you know that 

I've been treading water for your love, 
Whether I sink or swim, it's you I'm thinking of. 
I've been treading water for your love 
As my light grows dim maybe you're not strong enough boy 

Your drums, we're drumming, your drums 
Your drums, we're drumming, your drums 

I can't say where I'm going... no where 
This feeling goes on and on. 
I can't say that I'm going somewhere 
When I've been failing to reach you for so long 

For so long, I've tried 
To reach you baby, don't you know that 

I've been treading water for your love, 
Whether I sink or swim, it's you I'm thinking of. 
I've been treading water for your love 
As my light grows dim maybe you're not strong enough boy 

Maybe all along (all along) 
I've been holding on (holding on) 
To the promise that you need some time. 
Making everything into a story 
Making sure I never get to feel happy 
Taking everything you do my own way 
Thinking that you're begging me please 

I've been treading water for your love, 
Whether I sink or swim, it's you I'm thinking of. 
I've been treading water for your love 
As my light goes dim maybe you're not strong enough boy 

Your drums, we're drumming, your drums 
Your drums, we're drumming, your drums---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
