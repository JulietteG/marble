There was just one at the top 
of a pile of one million
and she hasn't got a clue she's become
a good samaritan

I missed her name
before i blinked from the scene
she'd run away if i got the chance
to meet her once again
would it be the same?

It was just one of those things
i needed to deal with
It was just one of those things.

It was just one of those things
I needed to deal with

There was just one at the top
of a pile of one million
and there's no way you've 
counted all our loves
What was i thinking of?

As it kicked off
I kept myself to myself and looked away
she would've put her foot in
but i just stayed in my own world

It was just one of those things
I needed to deal with
it was just one of those things

It was just one of those things
I needed to deal with

There was just one at the top
of a pile of one million
and she will be there
for many years to come
wondering where I am

It was just one of those things
I needed to deal with
It was just one of those things

It was just one of those things
that I should have dealt with
it was just one of those things

this is just one of those things
I needed to deal with
this is just one of those things

This is just one of those things
I needed to deal with
This is just one of those things

This is just one of those things
I needed to deal with
This is just one of those things---Lyrics submitted by Faern.
