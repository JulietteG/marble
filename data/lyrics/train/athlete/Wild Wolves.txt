As a friendly fire
Wasn't quite enough
You go and drop this
Bomb on us

The devil stood there
Drenched in sand
I'm here to give you a
Helping hand

Wild Wolves, always stare me out
I'm not running
I'm not running away

And the desert brought
News from the West
This could be your biggest test
Grab your gun and your survival kit
We're gonna get through the very worst of this

So, Wild Wolves, always stare me out
I'm not running
I'm not running
Wild Wolves, always stare me out
I'm not running
I'm not running away

And my soul is a dark place
But I know your love
I know your love
My soul is a dark place
And my soul is a lonely one
And I'm not alone
I'm not alone
My soul is a lonely one
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

Wild Wolves, always stare me out
I'm not running 
I'm not running
Wild Wolves, always stare me out
I'm not running
I'm not running away---Lyrics submitted by Katy.
