And I can't believe
Forever it seems to live out these dreams
When you start to think about taking a chance
You can't give a damn

Huh I'm a hopeless romantic
Fell in love with a simple idea
With a little bit luck and a whole lotta work
I can make everyone of these visions real

So we don't care what the people say
And we don't care what they want to do
And we don't care about it anymore
We do what we want
I ain't wasting a no more time
Its now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never Whoa
It's now or never Whoa
It's now or never.

We don't care what the people say
And we don't care what they want to do
And we don't care about it anymore
We do what we want
I ain't wasting a no more time
Its now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never

It's time to decide if its worth the fight or letting it slide
And I drew the line at wasting away or waiting to be saved
Yay y'all made my own luck in my head on straight and kicked up the dust
And the money well it don't mean much
I did it for the love and that was enough
The way I dreamed it ain't the way it played out
Missed every road that looked to be the safe route
No directions I made my way out
I don't give a damn what they say no way now.

We don't care what the people say
And we don't care what they want to do
And we don't care about it anymore
We do what we want
I ain't wasting a no more time
Its now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never Whoa
It's now or never Whoa
It's now or never

We don't care what the people say
And we don't care what they want to do
And we don't care about it anymore
We do what we want
I ain't wasting a no more time
Its now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never

I'm about to get mine mine mine Its about that time

We don't care what the people say
And we don't care what they want to do
And we don't care about it anymore
We do what we want
I ain't wasting a no more time
Its now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never Whoa
It's now or never Whoa
It's now or never

We don't care what the people say
And we don't care what they want to do
And we don't care about it anymore
We do what we want
I ain't wasting a no more time
Its now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never
I'm about to get mine
It's now or never---
