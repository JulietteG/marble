I've been feeling real good, came a long way from misunderstood
Far away from the days where I wouldn't wanna go home cuz I was afraid of the truth
See I was scared to admit that failing was in the back of my head
Comes a point when lying no longer works so you have to stand up for how you want to live

Chorus:
Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off

Everybody go
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
yea yea yea yea
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
yea yea yea yea

And I don't know better but as far as I came it felt like forever,
Seconds turn to hours days turn to months another year pass by but don't feel like much
So if I got one chance, motherfucker I'ma make yall dance
I'mma have as much fun as I can and figure out the rest when I etch out a plan


Chorus:
Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off

Everybody go
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
yea yea yea yea
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
yea yea yea yea

I'm feelin better than I ever thought, it's possible but now I know
I'm feelin better than I ever did, impossible don't exist
Impossible don't exist

Everybody go
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
yea yea yea yea

Everybody go
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
yea yea yea yea

Chorus:
Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off
Tonight is the night is the night that were losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off---Lyrics submitted by changuanhao.
