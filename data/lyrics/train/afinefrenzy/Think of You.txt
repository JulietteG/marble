It's one hundred and nine degrees in this crowded room
No room to breathe with walls as cold as a gallery
This is no place for me
Such hard faces set in smoke
The smell lingers in my clothes
It's a bad night to be alone
But that's the way it goes

And I think of you whenever life gets me down
I think of you whenever you're not around
And you rest your bones
Somewhere far from my own
Yeah, but you still pull me home

I thought I had it figured out in a brand new life
With a great big house
And green initials on the towels
I should be happy now
Well, you got yourself a family
And you planted roots down by the sea
I saw you once on the street
You didn't notice me

But I think of you whenever life gets me down
I think of you whenever you're not around
You rest your bones
Somewhere far from my own
Yeah, but you still pull me home

Just to put your mind at ease
You don't owe me anything
You paid me well in memories

And I think of you whenever life gets me down
I think of you whenever you're not around
And you rest your bones
Somewhere far from my own
Yeah, but you still pull me home
Yeah, you still pull me home
You still pull me home---Lyrics submitted by Cheyenne.
