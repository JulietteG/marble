Help me out, 
said the minnow to the trout,
I was lost and found,
myself swimming in your mouth.

Woah woah

Help me cheif,
I've got plans for you and me.
I swear upon this riverbed,
I'll help you feel young again.

Woah

Not your everyday curcumstance;
The hummingbird,
taking coffee with the ants,
And I said:

Please,
I know that we're different.
But we were one cell in the sea,
in the beginning.

And what we're made of,
Is all the same one.
We're not that different,
after all.

Help me out, 
said the eagle to the dove,
I've fallen from 
my nest so high above.

Woah woah

Help me fly,
I am too afraid to try.
Now sattled with a fear of hights,
I'm begging you can set me right.

Woah

Not your everyday curcumstance;
The elephant,
sharing peanuts with the rats.
And I said:

Please,
I know that we're different.
But we were one cell in the sea,
in the beginning.

And what we're made of,
is all the same ones.
We're not that different,
after all.

We are tied in history,
quite connected like a family.

We are tied in history,
quite connected like a family,
family.

So please,
I know that we're different.
We were one cell in the sea,
in the beginning.

And what we're made of,
is all the same as,
all the same.

We're not that different.
After all.---Lyrics submitted by Shealia.
