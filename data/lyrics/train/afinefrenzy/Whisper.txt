running the race 
like a mouse in a cage
getting nowhere, but Im trying
forging ahead
but Im stuck in the bed
that I made, 
so Im lying

but if you keep real close
yeah, you stay real close
I will reach you.
Im down to a whisper 
in a daydream on a hill
shut down to a whisper
can you hear me still
eager to please, 
trying to be what they need 
but Im so very tired
Ive stopped trying to find 
any peace in my mind 
cause it tangles the wires

but if you keep real close
yeah, you stay real close
I will reach you.

Im down to a whisper 
in a daydream on a hill
shut down to a whisper 
can you hear me
can you hear me
still the sound, 
it dies on my lips
to fade away 
and to forget 

Im down to a whisper 
in a daydream on a hill
shut down to a whisper 
can you hear me, can you hear me (repeats) still.---Lyrics submitted by Nuwong.
