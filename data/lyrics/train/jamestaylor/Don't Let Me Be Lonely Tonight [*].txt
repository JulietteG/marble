Do me wrong, do me right. Tell me lies but hold me tight.
Save your good-byes for the morning light, but don't let me be lonely tonight.

Say goodbye and say hello. Sure enough good to see you, but it's time to go.
Don't say yes but please don't say no, I don't want to be lonely tonight.

Go away then, damn you, go on and do as you please,
You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees.
I'm undecided, and your heart's been divided, you've been turning my world upside down.

Do me wrong, do me right, right now, baby. Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight.
Save your good-byes for the morning light, morning light,
but don't let me be lonely tonight.
I don't want to be lonely tonight, no, no, I don't want to be lonely tonight.

I don't want to be lonely tonight.---
