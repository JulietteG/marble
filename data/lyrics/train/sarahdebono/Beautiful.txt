Living in a perfect world
Where everybody's beautiful
But no-one knows who you are

Everyone's a perfect ten 
Almost a superstar
How do you compare yourself to them ?

It seems
The way she looks is so plastic
How tragic,
Oh,
But there's more to life than what you see
Look in the mirror carefully
In time where gonna get it right

You got the power to be 
Anything that you
Wanna be ,
Wanna be baby
Gotta be  
If you wanna look a little deeper
Give yourself room to grow
Because your beautiful

Beautiful beautiful
Because your beautiful

People get caught up in fortune and fame
I don't believe that
Were one and the same
Trying to be just like that
Girl in the magazine

You got that power to be
Just anything that you wanna be
Wanna be baby gotta be
If you only look a little deeper
Give yourself room to grow

Cause you got the power to be anything that
Anything that you wanna be yeah
Anything that you wanna be yeah
Look a little deeper
Ohh yeah
Because you're beautiful---Lyrics submitted by tiegan.
