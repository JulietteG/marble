It's a cruel cruel world, to face on your own,
A heavy cross, to carry along,
The lights are on, but everyone's gone,
And it's cruel

It's a funny way, to make ends meet,
when the lights are out on every street,
It feels alright, but never complete,
without joy,

I checked you, if it's already been done, undo it,
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it,
On the rainy nights, even the coldest days,
you're moments ago, but seconds away,
The principal of nature, it's true but, it's a cruel world,

ooooh oooh oohh, ooh ooh oooh ooh, ooo wooah

We can play it safe, or play it cool,
follow the leader, or make up all the rules,
whatever you want, the choice is yours,
So choose,

I checked you, if it's already been done, undo it,
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it,

ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye oh oh,
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh,

I just knew, it's already been done, undo it,
It takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it,

I just knew ---
