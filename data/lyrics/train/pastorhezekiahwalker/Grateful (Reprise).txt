I am grateful for the things that You have done 
Yes I am grateful for the victories weve won 
I could go on and on and on about Your works 
Because Im grateful, grateful so grateful just to praise you, Lord 
Flowing from my heart 
Are the issues of my heart 
Is gratefulness 
(repeat 2x) 

Grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful 
Grateful, grateful, grateful, grateful 
Grateful, grateful, grateful ^gratefulness 
Is flowing from my heart 

Change pitch twice 
Flowing from my heart 
Are the issues of my heart 
Is gratefulness
