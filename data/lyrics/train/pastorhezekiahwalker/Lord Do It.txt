Lord, do it
Lord, do it for me
Lord, do it
Do it for me right now

You've read the bible
You've read the story
About the blind man
Who could not see

But one day he heard
Jesus was passing by
He said, lay your hand
He said, lay your hand
He said, lay your hand on me

Lord, do it
Lord, do it for me
Lord, do it
Do it for me right now

You've read the bible
You've read the story
About the blind man
Who could not see

But one day he heard
Jesus was passing by
He said, lay your hand
He said, lay your hand
He said, lay your hand on me---Lyrics submitted by nakihia.
