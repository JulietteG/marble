Put a clap in your hands
Put a dance in your feet
Put a praise on your lips
Celebrate the victory
Let all the people praise Him
His kingdon reign forever
Rejoice with a shout of triumph 
With Him we'll always win

(Chorus)
Triumph, overcome
The battles already won
You're a conquerer, defeater with authority
we take it by foce
Rejoice, celebrate, overflows is on the wat
You're a conquerer, defeater, we thank Him for the victory

Tell the world of His freatness
His word will bever fail
Testify of his goodness
His promisses prevail
The spirit of abumdance is in the atmosphere
Reach out and receive your blessing
For He's Lord over everything

(Chorus)

Done
Already done
Already, its already, already, its already done---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
