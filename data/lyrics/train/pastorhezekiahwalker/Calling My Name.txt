How many times do I go against Your will
Then you forgive me
But yet I still 
turn around and do the things
The things I shouldnt do
Cause I belong to You
And I know You will come through

Lord I know I take advantage of Your grace
Here in this Christian race
But yet I still hear You calling my name *


Verse:
How many times would it take for me to learn
That its only in Your will that Ill ever earn
Ill ever earn my lifes reward 
The honor due to me 
Life eternally 
Riches in glory

Lord I know 
I know I dont belong 
With you cause Ive done wrong
But yet I still hear You calling my name

Bridge:
Youre calling my name
To come into Your arms 
To be safe from fear and harm
Knowing this but I still choose to go my way
Then You still say 
You say that I am He
Who will supply your every need
Oh Lord Ive sinned but
Youre still calling my name (3xs)


Oh Lord Ive sinned but
Youre still calling my name(4xs)---Lyrics submitted by Laine'.
