trust in the Lord at all times
pour out your heart before Him
power belongeth to God
God has spoken once and twice have I heard this
power belongeth to God
who can search His understanding
His thoughts higher that ours
all power in His hands, for my life He has a plan
God is our salvation, we find refuge in him
power belongs, power belongs to God

great is our God almighty and He is strong in
battle
power belongs to our God
although a host encamp me, encamp and do
surround me
power belongs to our God
i shall not be afraid of the terror by night
nor the arrow by day, i'm persuaded come what
may
and now troubles behind me,
i've found great joy before me
power belongs, power belongs to God
(repeat)

VAMP

there is nothing too hard for God 
nothing too hard for God power belongs to God
(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by joi.
