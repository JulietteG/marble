Good night, my answer, your dreams are still sweet.
Good night, be careful with yourself, 
Don't worry about the money, 
Forget about the wealth.

You'll be my angel,
Divert me from hell.
Help me, protect me from myself.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

Good night my answer
Good night my answer
Good night...
Good night...---Lyrics submitted by Ariel.
