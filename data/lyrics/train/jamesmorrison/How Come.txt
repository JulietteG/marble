How come you always wind up changing your direction? 
How come you always end up dancing through the room? 
How come you always never wanna use protection? 
How come you're floating like a helium balloon? 

I can't keep up 
You're moving too fast 
I got to know 
Is this gonna last? 
Cause I can't tell whether you're up or you're down 
This whole situation is spinning me round 
Spinning me round 
Spinning me round 

How come you always end up changing your intentions? 
How come you always wind up blowing hot and cold? 
One minute honest then you're full of false pretension 
Head in the clouds but still you're desperate to control, to control 

I just don't know what to believe 
You build me and then you bring me down on my knees 
You say you want me 
Then you're up and you're gone 
I got to know just where you're coming from 
Coming from, where you're coming from 

I got to know before it's over 
One way or the other 
If you're stringing me along 

I can't keep up 
You're moving too fast 
I got to know 
Is this gonna last? 
Cause I can't tell whether you're up or you're down 
This whole situation is spinning me round 
Spinning me round 
Spinning me round 

How come? 
How come? 

How come you always wind up changing your direction?---Lyrics submitted by Polly.
