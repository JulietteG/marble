I'm trying to change to make the best for us,
but I'm just the same, same as I ever was

Oh and if you stay with me honestly it's what I want,
but if you stay with me
 I know I'll hurt you more

So won't you save,save yourself
by leaving me now for someone else 
If I'm crying out ,don't listen to it
It's only my heart

So tell me I'm wrong,please won't you change my mind
This love's so intense sometimes it can leave you blind

Oh and if you stay with me honestly it's what I want,
but if you stay with me
 I know I'll hurt you more

So won't you save,save yourself 
by leaving me now for someone else
If I'm crying out,don't listen to it
It's only my heart

And I don't wanna let you go but I know
It's the right thing to do,baby
And I don't think that I'm that strong to say goodbye
I don't wanna see you cry

So won't you save,save yourself 
by leaving me now for someone else
If I'm crying out,don't listen to it
It's only my heart, I said it's only my heart

I said it's only ny heart
It's only my heart
Only,only my heart---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
