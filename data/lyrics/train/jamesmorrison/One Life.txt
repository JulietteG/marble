When I was a young boy
I was living for the moment
The world was wide open
I had every choice
But with so many choices
I just didnt know what to do now
All I say is just forget it
If you tell me Ill regret it
Just let it be what it is
Coz its so easy to say

If I knew yesterday what I know today
Where would I be tomorrow
I wont let my soul slide away
Id do whatever it takes
Coz this times only borrowed

I got one life, one life, one life
And Im gonna live it
I got one life, one life, one life
And Im gonna live it right

My daddy sat me down
He said Son, its probably time to start making some plans
And I said No, not right now
With so many choices
I just didnt know what to do now
All I say is just forget it
If you tell me Ill regret it
Just let it be what it is
Coz its so easy to say

If I knew yesterday what I know today
Where would I be tomorrow
I wont let my soul slide away
Id do whatever it takes
Coz this times only borrowed

I got one life, one life, one life
And Im gonna live it
I got one life, one life, one life
And Im gonna live it right

You say the more you think
You know whats right
The less you do
What you feel inside
So I wont pretend that I always know
I just follow my heart wherever it goes
And I may not always get it right
But at least Im living coz Ive only got this

One life, one life, one life
Ive got this one life

If I knew yesterday what I know today
Where would I be tomorrow
I wont let my soul slide away
Id do whatever it takes
Coz this times only borrowed

I got one life, one life, one life
And Im gonna live it
I got one life, one life, one life
And Im gonna live it right

When Im an old man
Hope Ill be rocking in my chair
Smiling to myself
Ill tell my baby girl
You only got one life
So make sure you live it right---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
