So close to midnight, under the streetlights.
Leaving behind what I don't need.
I've walked like a blind man and my eyes are open.
You are the only place for me, yeah.

Won't you hold on just for a while?
Please don't give up on me tonight.

'cause I'm on my way, I chased the day.
And I'll keep running all night.
I just won't rest to catch my breath.
I will run every red light to get to you.
No, I will get to you.
No, I will get to you.

I'll chase past the tail light, head for the skyline.
Hoping that that won't change your faith.
I see them appearing, the cracks in the pavement.
Running I pray I'm not too late.

Won't you hold on just for a while?
Please, please don't give up on me tonight.

'cause I'm on my way, I chased the day.
And I'll keep running all night.
I just won't rest to catch my breath.
I will run every red light to get to you.
No, I will get to you.
No, I will get to you.

I'll get to you.
Just hold on a little longer.
I'll get to you.
Oh just don't give up on me love.
I will get to, I will get to you.

'cause I'm on my way, I chased the day.
And I'll keep running all night.
I just won't rest to catch my breath.
I will run every red light to get to you.
No, I will get to you.
No, I will get to you.
I will.

I will get to.
I will get to you. ---Lyrics submitted by Martin Aron Eid.
