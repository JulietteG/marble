I was born with tears in my eyes
Like everybody else I know
Kicking and screaming
All I could see was a light in a world so cold

No-one to hold you
Feels so lonely
Left out on your own
But we were born with tears in our eyes
And thats how we learned the strength to fight

Its a beautiful life
Well, you wont always see it that way
When youre deep in a hole
With nowhere to go
And you cant see it change

(Its a beautiful life)
Coz its just out of sight
Its a beautiful life

Youre scared, got the fear every day
Sounds like everybody else I know
Takes a hole in the ground
Or the sky falling down
Before we can let it show

If youre just like me
Youre trying to believe
That its all going to work out fine
We can live with the doubt
Were trying to do without
Maybe we dont have to fight

Its a beautiful life
Well, you wont always see it that way
When youre deep in a hole with nowhere to go
And you cant see it change

(Its a beautiful life)
Coz its just out of sight
Its a beautiful life

I tried so hard to keep hanging on
Well maybe you should just let it go
Let the hope in your heart break the fall

Sing with me
Its a beautiful life
Well, you wont always see it that way
When youre deep in a hole with nowhere to go
And you cant see it change

(Its a beautiful life)
Coz its just out of sight
Its a beautiful life---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
