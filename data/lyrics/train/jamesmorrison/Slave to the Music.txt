She pulled me in so easily
Right from the start
She played me like I was a melody
One bang on the drum, she funks me with her sweet kiss
She's touching me with lovers caress,
No I can't fight it
She's got my soul,
She's captured me
Holds me hostage when I hear that beat
I won't take these shackles off my feet
'Cause they're the only thing that make me feel free

That's why,
I'm a slave to the music
No I won't stop until my heart pops
I'm a slave to the music
No I won't give in till I stop breathing

She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
I don't wanna be saved
Slave to the music
I don't wanna be saved
I'm a slave to the music

It's 4.05 and I'm barely alive
But keep on givin'
It's the only way to survive
But I can't help but shuffle my feet
Moving like a zombie, chasin' the beat
She lures me in oh sweet surrender
Locks me down like a repeat offender
I won't take these shackles off my feet
'Cause they're the only thing that make me feel free

That's why
I'm a slave to the music
No I won't stop till my heart pops
I'm a slave to the music
No I won't give in till I stop breathing

She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
I don't wanna be saved
I'm a slave to the music
I don't wanna be saved, no no
I'm a slave to the music

If you feel it with me put your hands out now
If you feel it with me put your hands out now
Arms up, your hands out
If you feel like a zombie, shout it out now
If you feel like a zombie, shout it out now

Zigga, zigga, zigga, zigga, zigga, ziggoh... oo-hoo

She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
She got me rockin'
She got me movin'
She got me dancin'
I don't wanna be saved
I'm a, I'm a slave to the music
I'm a slave to the music, yeah
I'm a, I'm a slave to the music

I'm a slave to the music, yeah yeah

Don't want to be saved now...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
