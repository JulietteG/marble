Theres a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, its bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I leave with every piece of you
Dont underestimate the things that I will do

Theres a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And its bring me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I cant help feeling

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Baby I have no story to be told
But Ive heard one of you
And Im gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
It Reminds you of the home we shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I cant help feeling

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

We could have had it all
We could have had it all
It all, it all it all,
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
And you played it
To the beat---Lyrics submitted by Lauren.
