Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It had only just begun
But now it's over now
And your
In the heat of moments
With your heart
Playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
In my eyes
Your were smiling
In the spotlight dancing
With the night
The night fell
Off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When i dont get nothing back
And for and for and for
When i don't get nothing back
Boy, i'm tired

Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer you
Obviously prefer her

Chorus:
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When i don't get nothing back
And for and for and for
When i dont get nothing back
Boy, i'm tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When i don't get nothing back
And for and for and for
When i don't get nothing back
Boy, i'm tired

(I should have known)

Never mind said
Your open arms
I couldn't help
Belive the trick me
Back into them

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
