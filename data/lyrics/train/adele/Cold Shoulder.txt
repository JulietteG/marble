You say it's all in my head
And the things I think
Just don't make sense
So where you been then?
Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me
Like it's my fault

See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shotts me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with workds made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied

You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at m e and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

Time and time again I play the role of fool
Just for you
And even in the daylight when your gaming
I don't see through
I try to look for thing I hear
But my eyes never find

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her---Lyrics submitted by mika.
