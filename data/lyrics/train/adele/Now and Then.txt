Sometimes the hole
You left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through
The deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth
With words that I cry
How I'm still trying
To stay inside

Hearts break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts
Our hearts break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts

Every now and then
My memories ache
With the empty ideas
Of the ones we'd made
But as time goes on
And my age gets older
I love the ones I know
They're enough
To picture the rain

Cause heart break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts
Our hearts break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts

You know
When to make me
I might
Just your heal (4x)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
