i would toss and turn at night with your voice in my head,
like a broken record all the words you say,
and when i finally fall asleep, you find your way in to my dreams,
but i would never mind you see, coz i get to live my fantasy,

and i know that we make our mistakes,
but your holding every breath i take,
feeling this is more than fate,
so please dont let me go, my baby,
and i know that we make our mistakes,
but your holding every breath i take,
feeling this is more than fate, 
so please dont let me go, my baby,

i tried my best to get away from you so badly,
knowing that id give my heart to you so gladly,
but then it came reality, everywhere i went you came to me,
but now i give myself to you,
im so scared of what your gona do,

and i know that we make our mistakes, 
but your holding every breath i take,
feeling this is more than fate,
so please dont let me go, my baby, 
and i know that we make our mistakes,
but your holding every breath i take,
feeling this is more than fate,
so please dont let me go, my baby,

keep your arm exactly where they are, 
i wanna be here,
i wanna feel you,
and ill keep my thoughts exactly where you are,
i wanna be here,
i wanna feel you,

like a broken record (x10)---Lyrics submitted by laura.
