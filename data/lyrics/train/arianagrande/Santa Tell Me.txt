Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus
When I see him walking cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting now
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe
Until I know it's true love
That he reaks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But I knew you stay
I woke up and you wasn't be my side

Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a swing heart
If this is true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year

Oh, I want to have him beside me like the moon
On the 25th by the fireplace all alone
But I don't want no broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh baby
If you broke me, if you broke me

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away
If he won't be here next year---
