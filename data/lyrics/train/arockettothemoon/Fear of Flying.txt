I took a picture of a girl I once knew
I kept it here incase I'd run into you
The look on your face could light up a room
But instead you left
And now I'm sitting with my head on the dashboard
Push my seat back and close my eyes
I had this dream that I was on an airplane,
Afraid to fly
So i tipped my head to the side and I whispered
To this man that was in the isle
I said "do you know how long it takes before we die?"
And then I rolled awake

Can you take me back to the person I used to be
Back when you were there for me 
I know it seems like forever but do me this favor please
Way back when we were stupid
And held grudges just to help us sleep
Oh my god, how ridiculous were we?

I stop your breathing everytime Im around girl
Your body's sweatin and your hands start to shake
I know you can't control your eyes but i know that your looks are fake
So tease me once and I'll swear I'll to forget
How it feels when youve got nothing left
We'll take it slow and only work this sometimes
Oh yeah..

Can you take me back to the person I used to be
Back when you were there for me 
I know it seems like forever but do me this favor please
Way back when we were stupid
And held grudges just to help us sleep
Oh my god, how ridiculous were we?

Ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh
