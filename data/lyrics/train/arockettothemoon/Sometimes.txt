You're standin' all alone,
Short of breath and tired eyes.
You're shakin' to the bone,
Overdressed and nowhere else to go.
Oh girl, I need to know...

Let's get you from the cold,
I'll help you with your overcoat.
I'll never let you go,
I need you more than I could ever show you.
Tell me now, because I need to know...

Everybody needs somebody sometimes. (sometimes)
Everybody needs somebody on their mind.
So tell me what you want, girl;
I'll be there to hold you.
'Cause everybody needs somebody, sometimes.

Who are you?
I never heard so many lies, so
Tell the truth;
The only thing I ever wanted for you,
Was to show you, I know you.

So now you see,
I've finally found a part of me
That you don't need.
But needing isn't everything when
You want love.
And you want ours,
You need me.

Everybody needs somebody sometimes. (sometimes)
Everybody needs somebody on their mind.
So tell me what you want, girl;
I'll be there to hold you.
'Cause everybody needs somebody, sometimes.

So now you see,
I've finally found a part of me
That you don't need.
But needing isn't everything when
You want love.
And you want ours,
You need me.
You need me.
[chuckle]

Everybody needs somebody sometimes. (sometimes)
Everybody needs somebody on their mind.
So tell me what you want, girl;
I'll be there to hold you.
'Cause everybody needs somebody, 
(everybody need somebody)
Sometimes.

Everybody needs somebody sometimes. 
(everybody needs somebody)
Everybody needs somebody on their mind.
So tell me what you want, girl;
I'll be there to hold you.
'Cause everybody needs somebody, sometimes.---Lyrics submitted by pia.
