[Chorus] 
The block got my back, and my boys do too 
And my baby momma tripping saying she need more loot 
Every block every hood, every ghetto got beef 
Gotta heater on my lap and another in the back 
Shit, how'm I supposed to cope with all this stress on me 
Errybody and their momma call the feds on me 

I don't knew it, I'mma do it, I'mma do it (I'mma do it) 
Look I don't knew it I'mma do it, I'mma do it (I'mma do it) 
I got money in my head but I'm riding in the 
drop (drop) drop (drop) drop (drop) drop (drop) 

[Verse 1] 
Yeaah, feeling just like JFK 
In the city that little fly like JFK 
Sometimes La Guardia, I ain't gonna lie to ya 
If looks can kill then my style might bother ya 

That's why I'm with Nadia, I call my gun Nadia 
When she say hi to ya, Ba-ba-bye to ya 
Make it sound like saudia 
Arabia, maybe ya haters ya 
Watch what he say to her, Ya think 
I can hold my head high or die or I can live and duck 
My attitude is celibate, I don't give a fuck 

[Chorus] 
The block got my back, and my boys do too 
And my baby momma tripping saying she need more loot 
Every block every hood, every ghetto got beef 
Gotta heater on my lap and another in the back 
Shit, how'm I supposed to cope with all this stress on me 
Errybody and their momma call the feds on me 

I don't knew it, I'mma do it, I'mma do it (I'mma do it) 
Look I don't knew it I'mma do it, I'mma do it (I'mma do it) 
I got money in my head but I'm riding in the 
drop (drop) drop (drop) drop (drop) drop (drop) 

[Verse 2] 
Yaa 
Who are you to tell me how to conduct myself 
Why don't you practice safe sex and go fuck yourself 
The rumor is that I'm a hazard to a suckers health 
I coulda told you that, Ya I coulda told you that 
Picture me, now I'm fly, Where is them exposures at 
Right here, on my lap that's where my composure's at 
I'm back like a gun cocked I'm so cool, that 
If go to hell, all I'll need is my sunblock 
Nigga hold your head high and die, or live and duck 
My attitude it celibate, I don't give a fuck 

[Chorus] 
The block got my back, and my boys do too 
And my baby momma tripping saying she need more loot 
Every block every hood, every ghetto got beef 
Gotta heater on my lap and another in the back 
Shit, how'm I supposed to cope with all this stress on me 
Errybody and their momma call the feds on me 

I don't knew it, I'mma do it, I'mma do it (I'mma do it) 
Look I don't knew it I'mma do it, I'mma do it (I'mma do it) 
I got money in my head but I'm riding in the 
drop (drop) drop (drop) drop (drop) drop (drop) 

[Verse 3] 
I mean lets be honest 
Ya never liked a nigga 
Trying to lesbian this 
So I kept the strap on 
Clap off clap on, lights out like flights out 
You could be departed 
Never me who started 
I Lambo gallard it 
I am vehically challenged 
That means the car is retarded 
But regardless, I'm tin man, heartless 
No love hate son, looking for love get a show on VH1 

Nigga hold your head high and die, or live and duck 
My attitude is virgin, still don't give a fuck 

[Chorus] 
The block got my back, and my boys do too 
And my baby momma tripping saying she need more loot 
Every block every hood, every ghetto got beef 
Gotta heater on my lap and another in the back 
Shit, how'm I supposed to cope with all this stress on me 
Errybody and their momma call the feds on me 

I don't knew it, I'mma do it, I'mma do it (I'mma do it) 
Look I don't knew it I'mma do it, I'mma do it (I'mma do it) 
I got money in my head but I'm riding in the 
drop (drop) drop (drop) drop (drop) drop (drop)---Lyrics submitted by yannie.
