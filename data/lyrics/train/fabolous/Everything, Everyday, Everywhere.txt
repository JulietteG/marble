[Verse 1] : Fabolous
Same shit different day
just ride through the city
looking pretty as the usual (this what i do)
its the same old thing
got the name on the chain
just to let em know who's who (in case you aint know so)
and they know im over here
so they come and find me
right after they lose you (what took ya so long)
for you niggas in the way
we can let the gun say....excuse you (pardon, you lames)
at the end of the day
we just tryna find a way
and i might be a come up (nice)
baby you can catch a ride
but you gotta know how to do
more than keep a thumb up (you gotta stick girl?)
its so incredible
that it aint edible
what they know the cakes real (im the phillsbury dough man)
yo i couldnt even say
ask these other silicone niggas
how real fake feel

[Chorus] : Keri Hilson & Fabolous
Yea
Everday is my day
Ima do it my way

Everywhere that i be
Feel VIP

And Everybodys cool but
Ya (ya) just (just) aint (aint) me

[Verse 2] : Fabolous
Somebody better tell em
that we in this bitch
like an unborn baby (hey)
See we be everywhere
and they aint never there
couldnt tell you where they be (where you at baby?)
And you already know
You aint gotta ask me
You can see that every fingers up (whats up son?)
And Im so about my money
you aint talking about no money
you aint even gotta bring it up (huh?)
and i hope you dont think
we give a sugar honey iced tea
or a middle finger up (Hahaha)
I just stay sucker free
Leave the lames where they be
and i let my chips sprinkle up (i need a stack)
Everybody calm down
Its enough to go around
You just gotta say i met you off (talk to me)
Dont know what you looking for
'Less its a problem
My promises aint what you want nigga
