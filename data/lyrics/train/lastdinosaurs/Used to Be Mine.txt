I know that we're different, 
I know that we changed
We both go back to it
It's not how we used to be
People are strange
And now we're strangers

We've got a disease, we can't exist anymore
Something was different, I know
The final release, and now we're falling to stars
Oh we've opened, I know

So many stories, it's hard to believe
That you won't stay the same
I hope you understand
The way that my mind receives
Isn't my decision

I'm fighting to know

Sometimes I get stuck in this dream
It's not the way I want it to seem
Sometimes life can take this idea
It's not the way it's supposed to be

So much time and so many stories
Why did history feel fucking boring?
All our myths and all our exploring
Why do I just feel fucking boring?

So much time and so many stories
Why did history feel fucking boring?
All our myths and all our exploring
Why do I just feel fucking boring?

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

We've got a disease, we can't exist anymore
Something was different, I know
The final release, and we're falling to stars
Oh we've opened, I know

Used to be mine, not anymore, anymore
Used to be mine, used to be mine
Not anymore---Lyrics submitted by Tasmin.
