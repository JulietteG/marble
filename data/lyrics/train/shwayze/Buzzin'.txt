(Cisco Adler)
I met her at a backyard
blockparty by the bar.
And she kept lookin' at me
like she knew who I was.
She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me
like she fell in love.

(Shwayze)
Bang bang baby shot
me in the heart, in the dark,
with the dart of the spark
when it hit.
When we met at the spot
it was hot, like this song
saw the thong, it was on.
Now it's 8 in the mornin'
I move on like the Greyhound bus
I go town to town
and I prey on sluts.
I got to go,
so scream out your area code.
I'm comin' all the way
live from the 310!
I gotta whole lot of love
but none like you.
You make me wanna stay
here in heaven with you.
I'll write your name in the sand,
put your hand with mine.
Come on baby,
shoot your gun in the sky!

She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me
like she fell in love.

(Shwayze)
Bang bang baby hit me one time,
two days on the road
and you're still on my mind.
You'd think that I would learn
'cause I'm young and fine
But I'm broke, so I'm tryin' to make
a hustle out of rhyme.
I gotta see the world one girl at a time,
but you're hangin' on my sleeve
like I care that you're cryin'
and I do
I'm just tryin' to play it cool
I got a rep to protect,
down at the high school.
Why you tryin' to cage me in
and when I leave we both know
that you'll be pagin' him
and when I come back
we gonn' do it again.
I promise we gonn' do it again.

(Shwayze)
Bang bang, I wanna give you my name
but I'm tryin' to put some
diamonds in my Shwayze chain.
Babies change,
they start showin' them fangs
tryin' to take a ride on
those crazy trains.
Choo choo.
What the hell am I to do?
I got a girl in every city
from here to Peru.
When I left you,
I signed my name on your left boob
now go get that tattoed,
I'll be back soon.
Don't cry, I'll bless you
with a text soon.
I gotta go, but I'll
be back next June.
Or July. Sparks in the sky.
She said, 'Boy you crazy.'
Nah, I'm Shwayze.

And she kept lookin' at me
like she knew who I was.
She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me
like she fell in love.

And I don't know what she was on.
Whatever it was, I want some.
She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me
like she fell in love.---Lyrics submitted by john.
