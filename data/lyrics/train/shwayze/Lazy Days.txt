Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it aint your parents, its the damn police
We just wanna get our kicks for free
We just wanna get our kicks for free

Well I was walkin through MacArthur Park
Lookin for some sugar just to cure my heart
And after dark, I talk to the cabbie
Cause he drives me home if I call him daddy
And its alright
Just as long as I can get high
Sit back and watch the sunset in the sky
I dont know if you know what I mean
But its love, in Los Angeles

Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it aint your parents, its the damn police
We just wanna get our kicks for free
We just wanna get our kicks for free

Lazy days in Los Angeles
(Lazy days)
If it aint your parents, its the damn police
We just wanna get our kicks for free
(Lazy days)
We just wanna get our kicks for free
Walkin through Malibu
Not a thing to do
Gotta find a fine young little girl to screw over
I never meant to block your sunshine
I never meant to block your sunshine
I never meant to block your sun
I dont know if you know what I mean
But its love, in Los Angeles

Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it aint your parents, its the damn police
We just wanna get our kicks for free
We just wanna get our kicks for free

Lazy days in Los Angeles
(Lazy days)
If it aint your parents, its the damn police
We just wanna get our kicks for free
(Lazy days)
We just wanna get our kicks for free

Now everybody clap your hands
Were gonna do the dirty dance
Now everybody stomp your feet
To the beat (cmon)
We just wanna get our kicks for free
We just wanna get our kicks for free
(Tryna get em for free)
We just wanna get our kicks for free
(Tryna get em for free)
I dont know if you know what I mean
But its love, in Los Angeles

Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it aint your parents, its the damn police
We just wanna get our kicks for free
We just wanna get our kicks for free

Lazy days in Los Angeles
(Lazy days)
If it aint your parents, its the damn police
We just wanna get our kicks for free
(Lazy days)
We just wanna get our kicks for free

Lazy days in Los Angeles
(Lazy days)
If it aint your parents, its the damn police
We just wanna get our kicks for free
(Lazy days)
We just wanna get our kicks for free

Lazy days in Los Angeles
(Lazy days)
If it aint your parents, its the damn police
We just wanna get our kicks for free
(Lazy days)
We just wanna get our kicks for free
