Dirty minds
Dirty minds think alike
We got our heads in the gutter
And our fingers in the pie

Dirty minds (dirty minds)
Dirty minds think alike (a lot like mine)
We got our heads in the gutter
And our fingers in the pie

Lookin' at you from a distance
You seem so sweet and innocent
I can spot the bad girls a mile away

If you want to come and grab it
Life's too short for silly games
Never fighting off temptations
Take advantage of this nasty situation

Dirty minds (dirty minds)
Dirty minds think alike (a lot like mine)
We got our heads in the gutter
And our fingers in the pie

I get surprised and disgusted
You know damn well that you've been busted
I can see the naughtiness in your eyes

It takes one to know one
It's true, we two, we thing alike
Never fighting off temptation
Take advantage of this nasty situation

Dirty minds (dirty minds)
Dirty minds think alike (a lot like mine)
We got our heads in the gutter
And our fingers in the pie

Dirty minds (dirty minds)
Dirty minds think alike (a lot like mine)
We got our heads in the gutter
And our fingers in the pie

(oh baby you so dirty, I know you dirty baby)

Dirty minds, dirty minds think alike

Oh!

Dirty minds (dirty minds)
Dirty minds think alike (a lot like mine)
We got our heads in the gutter
And our fingers in the pie

Dirty minds (dirty minds)
Dirty minds think alike (dirty minds)
We got our heads in the gutter
And our fingers in the pie---Lyrics submitted by Keeley.
