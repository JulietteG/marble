Baby, baby, baby
So you think I got on evil mind,
Well I'll tell you honey,
And I don't know why,
And I don't know why.
So you think my singing's out of time,
Well it makes me money,
And I don't know why,
And I don't know why, anymore oh no.

Chorus 

So cum on feel the noize,
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild
We get wild, wild, wild
So cum on feel the noize,
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild
At your door. 

So you think
I got a funny face,
I ain't got no worries
And I don't know why,
And I don't know why,
So I'm a scruff bag well it's no disgrace,
I ain't in no hurry
And I don't know why
I just don't know why,
anymore oh no.

Chorus 

So you think we
have a lazy time,
Well you should know better
And I don't know why,
I just don't know why.
And you say I got a dirty mind,
Well I'm a mean go getter
And I don't know why,
And I don't know why, anymore oh no.

Chorus 

So cum on feel the noize,
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild
We get wild, wild, wild...---Lyrics submitted by Horacio.
