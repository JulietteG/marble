We got somethin' no amount of money can buy
We got somethin' more than just a temporary high
We got somethin' more than just a pie in the sky
So much more, so much more, to this life

It's more than just a bunch of tradition
It's more than emotion
We have a destiny

We will live, live
Come whatever may
We will dance, dance
Until the break of day
'Cause there's so much to live for
So much to live for

We're gonna march on
Walking through the thick and the thin
We're gonna make it, press onto the other side
Don't let go, just hang on, it'll all be alright
Come on, stand up, get ready to fight

Troubles will come in this lifetime
It might be a rough year, I will make it through

We will live, live
Come whatever may
We will dance, dance
Until the break of day
'Cause there's so much to live for
So much to live for

la la lala la lala la lala (Repeat 3X)

Troubles will come in this lifetime
It might be a rough year, I will make it through

We will live, live
Come what ever may
We will dance, dance
Until the break of day
'Cause there's so much to live for
So much to live for
So much to live for (Repeat 3X)

la la lala la lala la lala (Repeat 3X)

We will live, live---Lyrics submitted by Katy Burks.
