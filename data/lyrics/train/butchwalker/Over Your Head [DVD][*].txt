did you ever hear this one
about the one who got away
she snuck tight out the back door
it was on the news today
i was fishing for a hit song
when you woke me out of bed
but now im inspired and my brain is tired
and my eyes are blood red
go ahead and eat your sucker
i wont say a word
he gave you the castle
you gave me the bird

everybody is grey (im turning blue)
everything that i say (is about you)
dont take this wrong
i hope your arms are long
cause your gonna need em
when im going over your head

uh hello, can i take your order?
ive been waiting for days
i like a little compassion
with a side or mayonnaise
you never let the glue dry
when you broke me in two
and im not some stupid little model car
that you van abuse

go ahead and eat your sucker
i wont say a word
he gave you the castle
so ill give you the bird---Lyrics submitted by brittany.
