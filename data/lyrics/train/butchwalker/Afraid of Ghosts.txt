Well theres a man
Who dips his feet in holy water
And so he throws the rest of his body in
Says itll take more than wading
To keep the memories fading
Im at least up to my neck in sin

He said Im coming to terms with a ghost
Learning to deal
Im gonna take what scares me the most
And turn it into something real

I try to go to the hospice every Friday
Sit in traffic, thicker than blood
Try to know a man that i never really knew
And swim away from a forty year flood

And Im coming to terms with a ghost
Learning to deal
Im gonna take just what scares me the most
And turn it into something real

Sometimes she takes a little longer getting ready
To pretend theres someone to show
Did she ever find love
Or did this town have enough
I kinda bet, shell never let you know
But i can tell from the caked on powdered makeup
Covering wrinkles from smoking away tears
She wants it either way
And i want so bad to say
Love yourself for once my dear
She said

I bet shes coming to terms with a ghost
Learning to deal
Gonna take just what scares her the most
Turn it into something real---
