Ah don't gimme that (Don't gimme that) 
Don't gimme that (Don't gimme that) 
Don't gimme that 

Take my body, take my soul 
But don't take my rock n roll 
Don't you dare, I'll see your rage 
Hold your tongue but don't gimme that 

Take my money, take my car 
Don't you take my guitar 
It won't play with you 
Hoochie Koo, screw you 

Don't gimme that 
Oh baby you can take everything 
It don't mean a thing 
Anything to me 
Don't gimme that 
But don't control my rock n roll 
No, no, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Shut your head 
Hey baby don't gimme that 

Ah don't gimme that 

Well give me double trouble, heartache and pain 
I'll take the blame but don't gimme that (But don't gimme that) 
Lock me up, hold me in chain 
Ain't too bad but don't gimme that (Don't gimme that) 

Do whatever you wanna do to me 
You can have still my spray 
You're barking up the wrong tree 

Don't gimme that 
Oh baby you can take everything 
It don't mean a thing 
Anything to me 
Don't gimme that 
But don't control my rock n roll 
No, no, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Shut your head 
Hey baby don't gimme that 

Don't gimme that 

Don't gimme that (No, no) 
Let me breathe (Don't gimme that) 
I want another survival 
I won't give up my dreams 
You cannot break my wings 
Baby, I'm a survivor 
So don't gimme that 

Don't gimme that 

Don't gimme that 
Oh baby you can take everything 
It don't mean a thing 
Anything to me 
Don't gimme that 
But don't control my rock n roll 
No, no, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
Shut your head 
Hey baby don't gimme that 

Don't gimme that 
Don't gimme that
