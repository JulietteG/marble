Oh sleepy eyes
I'm by your side
I got those same old feelings going down
So mesmerised
Oh by your sighs
Got those same old feelings going down

Du,du,du,du,du,du,du
Du,du,du,du,du,du,du
Everlovin' man, Everlovin' woman
Du,du,du,du,du,du,du
Du,du,du,du,du,du,du
Lovin' never has
Lovin' never could....
Feel half as right
As it does tonight

The shadows on the walls
Away from all the calls
I've got those same of feelings going down
Beginning and end is gone
There's only now, That's all
I've got those same old feelings going down

Du,du,du,du,du,du,du
Du,du,du,du,du,du,du
Everlovin' man, Everlovin' woman
Du,du,du,du,du,du,du
Du,du,du,du,du,du,du
Lovin' never has
Lovin' never could....
Feel half as right
As it does tonight---Lyrics submitted by Karen.
