Oh, fuck it all!

[V1:]
Sick of being sick and tired, sick of understanding
Tired of feeling sick to my stomach
Demons inside command me

They're saying crush it, break it, smash it
Fuckin' kill 'em all!
Laugh as it falls away
I won't dodge another silver bullet
Just to save a little face

[Chorus:]
I want you to know, I want you to see
I want you to look beyond your own eyes
Past your afflictions

[V2:]
How many people really care?
How many will be standing?
I'll light the match, the flame, the fuse, the bomb
Rescue the world from slavery

I wanna torch it, burn it, scorch it, fuckin' stomp it out
Laugh as it blows away
I won't eat another rotten apple
Though I've grown to like the taste

[Chorus:]
I want you to know, I want you to see
I want you to look beyond your own eyes
Past your afflictions
I want you to hurt, want you to bleed
I want you to look beyond your own face
Past your infections

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm taking back control with my knuckles
I'm taking back control with my knuckles
I'm taking back control with my knuckles
I'm taking back control with my knuckles

Smash it, burn it, break it, kill it
Fuck 'em all!

[Chorus:]
I want you to know, I want you to see
I want you to look beyond your own eyes
Past your afflictions
I want you to hurt, want you to bleed
I want you to look beyond your own face
Past your infections---Lyrics submitted by Tobby.
