I'd give anything 
Just to cut you free
I'd give blood 
Just to watch you
Just to watch you bleed

I see through you and all your lies
You are everything that I despise
You won't take shit when you leave
What the hell do you want from me?

I'm over it
So over it
This is goodbye

I'd give anything
Just to cut you free
I'd give blood 
Just to make you
Just to watch you bleed

I know you better than you do
I'm to fucking blame, so are you
It won't kill me to watch you leave
What the fuck do you want from me

I'm over it
So over it
This is goodbye

I'd give anything
Just to cut you free
I'd give blood 
Just to make you
Just to watch you bleed

Just to make you
Just to watch you 
Just to make you
Just to watch you bleed

I'd give anything
Just to cut you free
I'd give blood 
Just to make you
Just to watch you bleed

I'd give anything
Just to cut you free
I'd give blood 
Just to make you
Just to watch you bleed---Lyrics submitted by Nate Juranek.
