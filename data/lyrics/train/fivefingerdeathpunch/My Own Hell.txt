Twisting and turning,
unable to sleep.
And the voices never stop!

My thoughts speak louder the more I resist.
And theyre driving me insane!
Do they ever go,
inside?

Im a danger to myself.
Im a danger to myself!

Inside.

Im a prisoner of my own hell.
My own hell!

Losing the battle I waged on myself.

Toys in the attic.
Its all getting worse.
Why wont they let me be?
Oh God make it stop!
Inside.

Im a danger to myself.
Im a danger to myself!
Inside.

Im a prisoner of my own hell.
My own hell!

Fit me for a straight-jacket!
Put me in a padded cell!
Im a danger to you all!
And Im a danger to myself.
Inside.

Im a danger to myself.
Im a danger to myself!
Inside.

Im a prisoner of my own hell.
My own hell!
Inside.
Im a danger to myself.
Im a danger to myself!
Inside!
Im a prisoner in my own hell!
MY OWN HELL!---Lyrics submitted by Calvin.
