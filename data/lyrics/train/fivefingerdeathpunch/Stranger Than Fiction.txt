It's stranger than fiction how you've decayed.
It must be so lonely lost within your ways.

you're born alone, you die alone.
The rest is yours to fill the gap.

The world goes on without you here.
You're just a-just collapse.

Is this what you wanted to be?
Alone standing by yourself.

Is this all you wanted to be?
Or was that a cry for help?

(By yourself) X3

Vulgar grenades you throw at me,
I can't believe you stoop so low.

Of all the things you took away,
I miss my mind the most

Is this what you wanted to be?
Alone standing by yourself.

Is this all you wanted to be?
Or was that a cry for help?

(By yourself) X3

Is this what you wanted to be?
Alone standing by yourself.

Is this all you wanted to be?
Or was that a cry for help?

Is this what you wanted to be?
Alone standing by yourself.

Is this all you wanted to be?
OR WAS IT A CRY FOR HELP!

It's stranger than fiction how you've decayed.
It must be so lonely lost within your ways.---Lyrics submitted by Colten James Price.
