Go
Right

Disgusted by your weakness
You have no right to live
To know you is to hate you
But your life's yours to give

[Pre-Chorus:]
You monkey see, you monkey do
You're always doing what they tell you to
You're such a puppet on string
You don't get it!

[Chorus:]
I won't bow to something that I've never seen
I can't believe in something that doesn't believe in me
I'm not blood of your blood, I'm no son of your god
I've no faith in your fate
Still I find salvation

Right

[V2:]
You think you have the answers to every last detail
In your eyes, you're the victor
In mine you've only failed

[Pre-Chorus:]
You monkey see, you monkey do
You're always doing what they tell you to
You're like a puppet on string
You don't get it!
You monkey see, you monkey do
You're always doing what they tell you to
You're like a puppet on string
You don't get it!

[Chorus:]
I won't bow to something that I've never seen
I can't believe in something that doesn't believe in me
I'm not blood of your blood, I'm no son of your god
I've no faith in your fate
Still I find salvation
Still I find salvation
Still I find salvation---Lyrics submitted by Shaina.
