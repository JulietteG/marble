I believe, I believe there's love in you
Grid locked on the dusty avenues
Inside your heart, just afraid to go
I am more, I am more then innocent
But just take a chance and let me in
And I'll show you ways that you don't know

Don't complicate it
Don't let the past to take
Yeah, I have been patience
But slowly I'm losing faith

So please
I know you baby
I know you baby
So please
I know you baby
I know you baby

I believe, I believe you could love me
But you're lost on the road to misery
And what I gave to you
I could never get back
Don't complicate it
Don't drive yourself insane
Yeah, say what you will
But I know that you want to stay

Chemicals rushing in
I know where I belong to
I'm burning like a cannonball in the air
Crashing into who I belong to

I have been patience
But slowly I'm losing faith

The shadows of your heart
Are hanging in the sheets waiting
I know you, baby
The secrets that you hide
Come just to drown us
and it's just like this
I know you, baby---
