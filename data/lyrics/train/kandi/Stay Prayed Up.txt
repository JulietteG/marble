(feat. Marvin Sapp)

Why me Lord
That's what I kept on saying not too long ago
It seems like I was living in the darkest hole
My sadness and my anger start to take control
I had a lot of stuff weighing on me y'all
I shed a lot of tears that you didn't see, no
But I couldn't let grief consume me
Cause I got a little girl depending on me

It can't rain forever
The sun's got to shine again
I remember that old saying
So I kept praying and you should do the same my friend

I stay prayed up, that gets me by
That's how I made it through my darkest times
Yeah I'm a sinner and that's no lie
Thank God my prayers are heard cause He knows I try
Yeah I stay prayed up, yes I stay prayed up
See the only way I made it through my pain is through God's favor

Why me Lord
How am I supposed to raise these kids alone
I do the best I can to keep a happy home
It's hard to do it now, my better half is gone
Got a lot of eyes looking at me y'all
Judging every move that I'm making y'all
I'm just trying to do the best that I can
But it's hard cause I'm just an ordinary man

It can't rain forever
The sun's gonna shine again
I remember the old saying
So I just keep praying and you should do the same my friend

And I stay prayed up, that gets me by
That's how I made it through my darkest times
Yeah I'm a sinner and that's no lie
Thank God my prayers are heard cause He knows I try
Yeah I stay prayed up, yes I stay prayed up
You see the only way I made it through is through God's favor
See I stay prayed up, I stay prayed up
You see the only way I made it through my pain is through God's favor

I stay prayed up, that gets me by
That's how I made it through my darkest times
Yeah I'm a sinner and that's no lie
Thank God my prayers are heard cause He knows I try
Yeah I stay prayed up, yes I stay prayed up
Oh I made it through because of God's favor ---Lyrics submitted by Jayda Renee' McGruder.
