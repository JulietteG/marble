I feel, feel like a cokehead,
I feel, feel like I can't get drunk no more,
'Cause I'm on the floor, 
Looking for some action just to cook up the score.

I feel, feel like shooting up,
I feel, feel like giving up on my skateboard,
'Cause I'm fucking bored,
I wanna perfect life down sunset shore.

I feel, feel like a crackhead,
I feel, feel like I'm not gonna make it no more, 
'Cause I'm on the floor,
Just pick me up and give me some more.

I feel, feel like I'm a grandpa,
I feel, feel like I'm already 80 years old,
And my skin so cold,
I need a new body and I need a new soul.

I feel, feel like getting drunk, 
I feel, feel like fucking up my life,
So yeah, gonna call my friends,
I hope we'll make it til the end.

I feel, feel like shooting up,
I feel, feel like I can't get laid no more,
'Cause I'm on the floor
Just looking for some action just to cook up the score. 

I feel, feel like a cokehead,
I feel, feel like I can't get drunk no more,
'Cause I'm on the floor, 
Looking for some action just to cook up the score.

I feel, feel like shooting up,
I feel, feel like giving up on my skateboard,
'Cause I'm fucking bored,
I wanna perfect life down sunset shore.---Lyrics submitted by Leigh Smith.
