Pregnant teens on the Barton street bus,
Homeless people living off crust,
And theres a beat-up town car - its starting to rust,
Hard soles are kicking up dust,
Half a million people living in the corpse of the brown brick 50s
To the north, all the small town outcasts are now big city bourgeoisie 

All the boys in the halfway houses 
Wave to the girls of Emerald Street

Our calloused fingers, blood red on the brick - but we hold on
Well never falter, though they want us to slip - we hold on 

The desperate, downtown stealing bikes
Drunks in the village are picking fights 

So, police line the streets to read them their rights
No controlling hot summer nights
The sun goes down on the edge of town, at the end of everyday
We sit and watch the stacks, on fire, to the east across the bay 

All the boys in the halfway houses 
Wave to the girls of Emerald Street

Our calloused fingers, blood red on the brick - but we hold on
Well never falter, though they want us to slip - we hold on 


Theres something in the church belfry
At the corner of Victoria and King
And it screams out into the night 
It sings this citys plight 

All the boys in the halfway houses 
Wave to the girls of Emerald Street

(Hold On, Hold On)

Our calloused fingers, blood red on the brick - but we hold on
Well never falter, though they want us to slip - we hold on---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
