I find myself concerned,
For the common man, these days,
Evil are the minds,
That push the divide,
Forced to live a life,
In fear that his future's on the wane,
Midnight regulations,
Midnight regulations,
Burns his candle down,
Working to make ends meet,
But what can be done,
About the way things have become?
Fingers to the bone,
Ready to admit defeat,
Midnight regulations,
Midnight,

Brother! There is no charity,
For the common man,
when hes in need of relief,

And now hes hanging on,
To his final stitch of faith,
So, heres to all the years,
And the deaf ear fallen prayers,
Rich men behind closed doors,
Are trying to keep him in his place,
Midnight regulations,
Midnight regulations,
Oh, all you common men,
You need to fight for a new way,
Old hearts we need to mend,
Its time to start again,
The palace was dismantled,
Brick by brick, you will have your day,
Midnight regulations,
Midnight,

Brother! There is no charity,
For the common man,
When hes in need of relief,

They say just hold onto your hope,
But you know if you swallow your pride,
You will choke,

Brother! There is no charity,
[There is no charity, there is no charity!]
For the common man,
When he is in need of relief,
[When he's in need, when he's in need!]

Brother!
Brother!

Midnight!
midnight regulations.
Midnight!
