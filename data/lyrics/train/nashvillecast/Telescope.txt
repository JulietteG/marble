(feat. Hayden Panettiere)

 Yeah,
Wont do no good, if you run from me
There aint no cheatin, schemin my heart dont see
You left your troubles in my head, in my head
You left your secrets in my bed, in my bed
Youre like the cover of a book thats been read, baby
I know what line is coming next, coming next

You cant hide from me,
There aint no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I dont know
But my eyes, my eyes, my eyes are like a telescope

Youre kissing her, when my head is turned
You must be crazy baby, havent you learned?
You cant deceive me silly child, silly child
I dont believe that greedy smile, greedy smile
My intuition can see for miles and miles baby
Every little sin, and everywhere youve been

You cant hide from me,
There aint no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I dont know
But my eyes, my eyes, my eyes are like a telescope
Yeah, yeah

You left your troubles in my head, in my head
You left your secrets in my bed,

You cant hide from me,
There aint no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I dont know
But my eyes, my eyes, my eyes are like a telescope

You cant hide from me,
There aint no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I dont know
But my eyes, my eyes, my eyes are like a telescoe---
