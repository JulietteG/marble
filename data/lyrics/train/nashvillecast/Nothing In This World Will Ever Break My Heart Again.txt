(feat. Hayden Panettiere)

I finally kept my pride
And hailed a cab
Those cuttin words you said
Were the last stab
Therell be no tears this time
Theyve all dried up
No more sweet poison
I already drank that cup
This tunnels dark
But theres a little light glowing
Bright enough for me to run toward knowing

Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
No pain this life will put me through
Will ever ever hurt like you

Dont need a miracle
A superhero
Theres only one way up
When youre at zero
You took my innocence
But it was knowing
No i dont need you
And that made me a woman
I paid my dues
But thats a debt im done paying
Im standing strong
But Im still on my knees praying

Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
Nothing in this world will ever break my heart again
No pain this life will put me through
Will ever ever hurt like you---
