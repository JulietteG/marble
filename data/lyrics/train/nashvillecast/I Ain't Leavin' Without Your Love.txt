I'm old enough to know that
I'm too young to know a thing
But Ive seen what Ive seen
and if you ask me everything
Ill ever need

I've met a lot of faces and I know a lot of names
But everyone I've come across has all been just the same
But that all changed,
That all changed

CHORUS:
Under the downtown neon lights
That's when you caught my eye
You got me all worked up
I ain't leavin' without your love
Its obvious we both know
This don't end tomorrow
the night ain't long enough
I ain't leavin' without your love
I ain't leavin' without your love

Jukebox died closing time
So take me by the hand
Last call last song
So Give me one more dance

CHORUS: (2x)
Under the downtown neon lights
That's when you caught my eye
You got me all worked up
I ain't leavin' without your love
Its obvious we both know
This don't end tomorrow
the night ain't long enough
I ain't leavin' without your love
I ain't leavin' without your love

Tonight ain't long enough
I ain't leavin' without your love
Tonight ain't long enough
I ain't leavin' without your love
I ain't leavin' without your love---
