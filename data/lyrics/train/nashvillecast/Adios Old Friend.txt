You were headed
For some border town
to find a Spanish rose
And settle down

You hitched a ride
On a southbound
Mexican wind
Adios old friend

I heard you made it
Far as El Paso
Those Texas rangers
would not let it go

They tracked you down
On the banks
of the Rio Grande
Adios old friend

Do angels sing for outlaws?
I don't know
But I know outlaws pray
And I pray
It's so
Old friend---
