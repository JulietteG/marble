She was sitting there
With her beehive hair 
And said, honey, 
That's a waste of good mascara

She handed me a pink kleenex
And I'll never forget
What she said next 

Boys and buses got a lot in common 
They both pick up speed 
When you try to stop 'em 
You could waste your breath 
You could scream and cuss 'em 
But there's no use chasing after 
Boys and buses

Don't worry
We can fix that
Thank God for auto-tune

She said some leave with a guitar case
And some wind up at an army base

Heartbreaker
Moneymaker

Maybe I oughta marry her then
Take the money and run

...in Hollywood

But the cost is lost
Once the ticket's bought 
And you can't catch but
Don't wanna be caught---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
