(feat. Will Chase and Sara Evans)

I never pictured us, ever fighting this much 
Thought we were figured out, but it's so messy now 
Your words they cut so deep, and I think that you should leave 
I'll have to live without, what I can't live without 
It already hurts, so before it gets worst just 

Put my heart down, put my heart down 
Put my heart down, put my heart down 
And walk away 
Just like it was a loaded gun 
Put my heart down, put my heart down 
Put my heart down, put my heart down 
And walk away 
This kind of love is dangerous 

So pack up all your things, just leave some air to breathe 
A million toxic tears, fallin' like rain 'round here 
This is the final hour, the end of our story tonight 
And I don't wanna fight 

Put my heart down, put my heart down 
Put my heart down, put my heart down 
And walk away 
Just like it was a loaded gun 
Put my heart down, put my heart down 
Put my heart down, put my heart down 
And walk away 
This kind of love is dangerous 

It already hurts, so before it gets worse 
I know it ain't easy, but if you really loved me 

Put my heart down, put my heart down 
And walk away 

Put my heart down, put my heart down 
Put my heart down, put my heart down 
And walk away 
Just like it was a loaded gun 
Put my heart down, put my heart down 
Put my heart down, put my heart down 
And walk away 
This kind of love is dangerous---
