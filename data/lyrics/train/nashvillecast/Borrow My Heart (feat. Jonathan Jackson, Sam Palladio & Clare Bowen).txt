Won't you borrow my heart?
Take it, love, as long as you need
Won't you borrow my heart?
And don't you ever give it back to me
Don't you ever give it back to me

It served me well but it's better in your arms
Since the day I fell, I'd never get it all
Oh, my my. Oh, my my
With every beat, inside of my chest
It's all for you, you've made me a mess

No more me
No more I
Only we
We're gonna be

Won't you borrow my heart?
Take it, love, as long as you need
Won't you borrow my heart?
And don't you ever give it back to me
Don't you ever give it back to me

Hold it high
I know you'll keep it safe
Hold it close
Store it at your place---
