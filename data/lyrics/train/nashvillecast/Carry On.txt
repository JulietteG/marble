(feat. Clare Bowen & Mykelti Williamson)

Blue sky
No sign of rain
All of a sudden
Everything changed
I couldn't run
I couldn't stay dry
What do you do
When there's nowhere to hide?

Carry on
When you lost it all
Carry on
When you stumble and fall
Carry on
'Cause you got somethin' to say
Carry on
Here comes a better day

Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah

Carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry on

So young
And so free
The bright lights
Started blindin' me
Back then
Thought I could fly
Turns out I had to swallow my pride

And carry on
When I lost it all
Carry on
When I stumble and fall
Carry on
'Cause I got somethin' to say
Carry on
Here comes a better day

Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah

Carry on, carry on
Carry on, carry on---
