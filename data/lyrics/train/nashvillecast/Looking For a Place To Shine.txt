Like a coin
I was tossed into a wishing fountain
I was only one of a thousand
Looking for a little fortune

And you, you picked me up and put me into
your pocket
Nothing I could do to stop it
It started off full of promise

The shimmer of the shine that I'd never
seen before
The bright lights, I was taken in by the
spotlight
Coming from the stare of your wanting eyes,
like a Vegas green low
Yeah, grasping, wishing I could roll the
dice again.
You can always love, but you can't win
A heart is like no money you blow
Casino

Worthless, I didn't even know I was losing
But I was just a card you were using
A trick that you were good at playing
Oh and luck, didn't built up the Monte Carlo
Just like love never promised tomorrow

You are only looking to borrow
And I thought that I had a chance but I
gave it away to
The bright lights, I was taken in by the
spotlight
Coming from the stare of your wanting eyes,
like a Vegas green low
Oh, grasping, wishing I could roll the dice
again
You can always love but you can't win
A heart is like the money you blow
Casino

The bright lights, I was taken in by the
spotlight
Coming from the stare of your wanting eyes,
like a Vegas green low
Oh, grasping, wishing I could roll the dice
again
You can always love but you can't win
A heart is like the money you blow
