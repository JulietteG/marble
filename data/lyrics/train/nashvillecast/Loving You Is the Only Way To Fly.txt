 I should have moved on long ago
Why I still want you I don't know
These days my best laid plans,
Are built on shifting sands, It's not like I don't know you said goodbye.
Loving you is the only way to fly.

Can't find the strength to stand alone
Can't seem to find my way back home
I fell so far so deep
Can't eat, can't breathe, can't sleep
Don't much care if I live or die
Loving you is the only way,
Loving you is the only way to fly
Somebody said, "Some dreams come true, some pass you by."
That's how it is.

Sometimes I pray you'll come around
We'll find a house somewhere in town
I keep my hopes alive, with one long free-fall dive,
I think, drink, sink into this lie.
Loving you is the only way,
Loving you is the only way to fly
Somebody said, "Some dreams come true; some pass you by."---
