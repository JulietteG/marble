If you've got something else to say
Let's get it out before the end of the day
'Cause it's been too long singin' the same song
When we're losin' time

Trouble may come a-knockin'
But you will always be a friend of mine
A friend of mine
Leavin' what we knew behind
You will always be a friend of mine
A friend of mine

So many battles we have lost
So many bridges we had to cross
But it's been too long singin' the same song
Oh, but we've got time
(we've got time)

All we have is our best (all we have)
We can't give any more or less
Trusting God with the rest
We can open any door

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

You will always be a friend of mine
(You will always be a friend)
You will always be a friend of mine---
