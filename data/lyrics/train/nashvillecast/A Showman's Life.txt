A showman's life is a smokey bar
And the fevered chase of a tiny star
It's a hotel room and a lonely wife
From what I've seen of a showman's life
Nobody told me about this part

They told me all about the pretty girls
And the wine and the money and the good times
There's no mention of all the wear and tear
On an old honky tonker's heart
Well I might have known it
But nobody told me about this part

A boy will dream as children do
Of a great white way, until the dream comes true
And a phony smile in a colored light
Is all there is to a showman's life
Nobody told me about this part

They told me all about the pretty girls
And the wine and the money and the good times
There's no mention of all the wear and tear
On an old honky tonker's heart
Well I might have known it
But nobody told me about this part

And nobody told me about this part

They told me all about the pretty girls
And the wine and the money and the good times
There's no mention of, all the wear and tear
On an old honky tonker's heart
Well I might have known it
But nobody told me about this part
Well I might have known it
Nobody told me about this part ---
