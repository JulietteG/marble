Fighting for the things you give me
I want to share your love
Feeling like a wounded soldier
Strength is not enough
And I can't win this battle on my own

The sword has long been buried
Piled on with dirt
Speak to me your promises
Ressurrect your word

'cuz I cant win this battle on my own
No I cant win this battle on my own

Ill rise up and be your voice
I made my choice.
This is my story.
Your songs are stored inside my heart
So break me apart
Its for your glory.
Let it pour out of me.
Let it pour out of me.
Its for your glory.

So ride out on your wings of love
Show me that you're here
Cast down on my enemies
Trembling with fear

'cuz I cant win this battle on my own
No I cant win this battle on my own

Ill rise up and be your voice
I made my choice.
This is my story.
Your songs are stored inside my heart
So break me apart
Its for your glory.

Ill rise up and be your voice
I made my choice.
This is my story.
Your songs are stored inside my heart
So break me apart
Its for your glory.

Let it pour out of me.
Let it pour out of me.
Let it pour out of me.
Its for your glory.---
