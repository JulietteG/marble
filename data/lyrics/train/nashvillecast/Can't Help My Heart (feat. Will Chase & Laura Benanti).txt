Standing in the driveway
trying to see it your way
knowing you're gone
knowing you're gone

As the night bird starts to sing
Tail lights say everything I need to know
But I won't let you go

I can't help my heart
I can't catch the wind
so every night I'll raise the dead
and face the ghost of us again
I can't stop the flood
or drown your memory
I can be a hurricane
of driving rain and misery
oh, we might be worlds apart
but I can't help my heart

Ever see a lighting strike
far away in the dead of night make a sound
when it hits the ground
when I first looked in your eyes
I fell too hard to recognize the storm
A warning, I should have known

I can't help my heart
I can't catch the wind
so every night I'll raise the dead
and face the ghost of us again
I can't stop the flood
or drown your memory
I can be a hurricane
of driving rain and misery
oh, we might be worlds apart
but I can't help my heart

No I can't help my heart
I can't catch the wind
so every night I'll raise the dead
and face the ghost of us again
I can't stop the flood
or drown your memory
I can be a hurricane
of driving rain and misery
oh, we might be worlds apart (we might be worlds apart)
we might be worlds apart (we might be worlds apart)
but I can't help my heart
I can't help my heart

Standing in the driveway
Trying to see it your way---
