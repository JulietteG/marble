(Christmas)
The snow's coming down
(Christmas)
I'm watching it fall
(Christmas)
Lots of people around
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

(Christmas)
The church bells in town
(Christmas)
They're ringing a song
(Christmas)
What a happy sound
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching them shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home

They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas)
Oh if there was a way
(Christmas)
I'd hold back these tears
(Christmas)
But it's Christmas day
(Christmas)
Baby please come home

(Baby please come home...)
Baby please come home...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
