I can see your eyes staring into mine.
But its a battlefield
and youre on the other side.
You can throw your words sharper than a knife.
And leave me cold
in another house on fire.

I lay low, lay low,
and watch the bridges burn.
I lay low, lay low,
What more could I have done?

Now you only bring me black roses
And they crumble in the dust when theyre held.
Now you only bring me black roses
Under your spell.

She told me twice, all her good advice.
But I couldnt see
I was clouded by your lies.
You can smoke, a vision she foretold.
She said stay away
cause that boy's a warning sign.

I lay low, lay low,
and watch the bridges burn.

Now you only bring me black roses.
And they crumble in the dust when theyre held.
Now you only bring me black roses
Under your spell.

And Im done tryna be the one,
Picking up the broken pieces.
And Im done tryna be the one,
Who says I love you dear.
But Im leaving.

Now you only bring me black roses.
And they crumble in the dust when theyre held.
Now you only bring me black roses
But Im not under your spell,
Im not under your spell,

Im not under your spell,
Im not under your spell,
Im not under your spell.

Oooooooh, oooh---
