I will bend and I will sway
I will fight to stand up straight
When troubled winds blow my way,
I won't break.

I will hope and I will love.
I will give 'til there's enough.
That's the life I'm dreaming of,
I won't give up.

My head's spinning around and round
And the world keeps trying to bring me down, oh.
I bought a ticket to the joy parade
And I ain't jumping off of this happy train, no.

I will stumble, I will crawl.
Bang my head against these walls.
In the end I won't have it all,
But I'll stand tall.

My head's spinning around and round
And the world keeps trying to bring me down, oh.
I bought a ticket to the joy parade
And I ain't jumping off of this happy train, no.

I will sing, I will shout.
Let these words fly from my mouth.
I will live what this life's about,
With or without.
I will live what this life's about,
With or without.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
