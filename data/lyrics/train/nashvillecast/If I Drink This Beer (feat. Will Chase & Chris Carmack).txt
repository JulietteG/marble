If I drink this beer
I'll probably have two or three if I know me
I'll be digging up the past like it's money in the backyard

If I drink this beer
I know it's gonna seem like a good idea
To call you up in the middle of the night
And tell you how I feel

So I should just put it down
That last thing I need to do tonight is push my luck
Drunk, get all messed up
And tell you how bad you need my love
And how you'll never find a guy like me again

If I drink this beer
I know it's gonna lead to more
And I ain't sure what I'd do if I knocked on your door
And your boyfriend answered

If I take just one sip
It's gonna get ugly quick
And, man, it's tough,'cause I'm in love
And I need to ease the pain
So I just put it down

That last thing I need to do tonight is push my luck
Drunk, get all messed up
And tell you how bad you need my love
And how you'll never find a guy like me again

I still won't get you back
And that beer is all I'll have to hold
And it's cold as you at the end of the telephone line
In the middle of the night

So I just put it down
That last thing I need to do tonight is push my luck
Drunk, get all messed up
Yeah I should just put it down
That last thing I need to do tonight is push my luck
Drunk, get all messed up
And tell you how bad you need my love
And how you'll never find a guy like me again

If I drink this beer
I'll probably have two or three if I know me
I'll be digging up the past like it's money in the backyard---
