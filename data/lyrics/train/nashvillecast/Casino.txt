Like a coin
I was tossed into a wishing fountain
I was only one of a thousand
Looking for a little fortune
And you, you picked me up and put me into your pocket
Nothing I could do to stop it
It started off full of promise
The shimmer of the shine that Id never seen before

The bright lights, I was taken in by the spotlight
Coming from the stare of your wanting eyes, like a Vegas green low
Yeah, grasping, wishing I could roll the dice again.
You can always love, but you cant win
A heart is like no money you blow
Casino

Worthless, I didnt even know I was losing
But I was just a card you were using
A trick that you were good at playing
Oh and luck, didnt built up the Monte Carlo
Just like love never promised tomorrow
You are only looking to borrow
And I thought that I had a chance but I gave it away to

The bright lights, I was taken in by the spotlight
Coming from the stare of your wanting eyes, like a Vegas green low
Oh, grasping, wishing I could roll the dice again
You can always love but you cant win
A heart is like the money you blow
Casino
