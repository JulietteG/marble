You should have seen it
Like a flash of lightning
Shouldve been lookin
Out at the dark horizon
But now the storm
Is all around us
Your on the shore
And Im in the ocean now

Dont wanna be swept away
Dont wanna be kept from you
And all of the love we made
Dont want it to fade from view
Dont wanna be swept away
You know my heart is true
I found a dream thats new
Never seen sky so blue
This is my big wave

We couldve saved it
Like a lighthouse in the dark
We could have made it
But I couldnt see the spark
And now the fall its seems rolling
Everything falls
Everythings cold and I

This is my big wave

I dont know up from down
Sight from sound
Spin around in darkness
The ocean braves
I pray for strength
I swore that it was all I could take

And Im just swept away
From you
And all the love we made
Dont fade from view

Swept away
You know my heart is true
I found a dream thats new
Never seen a sky so blue
This is my big wave
My big wave
This is my big wave---
