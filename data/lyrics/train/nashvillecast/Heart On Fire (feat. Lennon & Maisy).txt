You were the girl
With the blazin heart on fire.
Free, as a dress,
In the breeze,
Hangin on a laundry line
In the sunshine
You had the eyes,
Saw the beauty in the mess.
Love in the moment,
On the fly,
And you figured out the rest
You were fearless
Who threw the punch
that you couldn't handle?
What came along,
Blew out your candle?
Love, gotta light it back up
Maybe it's just yourself
that you're fightin
Keepin the shine in
your star from rising up
Gotta light it back up
Won't let you sink,
Like a stone, to the
bottom, bottom
Let me remind you of
the you you've forgotten
It's just a road,
It's just the way
that you're ridin
I know it's rough,
Gotta get back up
Light it back up
Who threw the punch
that you couldn't handle?
What came along,
blew out your candle?
Love, gotta light it back up
Maybe it's just yourself
that you're fightin, keepin the
shine in your star from rising up
Gotta light it back up
Won't let you sink,
like a stone, to the
bottom, bottom
Let me remind you of
the you you've forgotten
It's just a road, it's just
the way you've been ridin
I know its rough,
gotta get back up
Light it back up
You were the girl,
with the blazin heart on fire---
