First you fall, then you fly
and you believe that you belong
up in the sky.
Flap your arms, as you run,
every revolution brings you closer to the sun.
You fall asleep in motion, in unchartered
hemispheres,
and you wake up with the stars
fallin' down around your ears.
And when they hit the ground,
they're nothin' but stones
that's how you learn to live alone.
That's how you learn to live alone.

Bit by bit, you slip away,
you lose yourself in pieces
by the things that you don't say.
You're not here, but you're still there
The sun goes up and the sun goes down,
but you're not sure you care.
You live inside the false,
till you recognize the truth.
People send you pictures,
but you can't believe it's you.
Seems forever since your house
has felt like home
that's how you learn to live alone
that's how you learn to live alone.

It don't feel right, but it's not wrong.
It's just hard to start again this far along.
Brick by brick, the letting go,
as you walk away from everything you know
When you release resistance
and you lean into the wind,
till the roof begins to crumble,
and the rain comes pourin' in,
And you sit there in the rubble,
till the rubble feels like home
That's how you learn to live alone
that's how you learn to live alone
that's how you learn to live alone---
