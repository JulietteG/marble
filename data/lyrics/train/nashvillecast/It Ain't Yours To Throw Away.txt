That same road that brought you here
Will sure as hell take you home
The life you left behind will have you back
You're tired of paying dues in worn out shoes
and Broadway blues
And any fool will tell you
the damn ol' deck is stacked

What if you're just a vessel
And God gave you something special

It ain't yours to throw away
It ain't yours to throw away
Every time you open up your mouth
Diamonds come rolling out
It ain't yours to throw away
No ...

And all of the players, the movers, and shakers
The story maker suits have gone home
You drew the last slot
You thought it was your shot
But now it's just one more chance blown

What if you're just a vessel
And God gave you something special

It ain't yours to throw away
It ain't yours to throw away
Every time you open up your mouth
Diamonds come rolling out
It ain't yours to throw away
No ...

And our town is cold as January
Life comes true, and dreams get buried
Every day ...
Destiny won't be denied

It ain't yours to throw away
No, it ain't yours to throw away
'Cause every time you open up your mouth
Diamonds come rolling out
It ain't yours to throw away

It ain't yours to throw away ...
Throw away---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
