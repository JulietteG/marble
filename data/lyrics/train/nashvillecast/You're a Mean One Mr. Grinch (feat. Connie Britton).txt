You're a mean one Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel.
You're as cuddly as a cactus,
And as charming as an eel,
Mr. Grinch!
You're a bad banana,
With a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch!
Your heart's an empty hole.
Your brain is full of spiders.
You've got garlic in your soul,
Mr. Grinch! I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

Mr. Grinch! No, thank you
Mr. Grinch! Honestly

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch.
You have termites in your smile.
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile.

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch!
You're a nasty, wasty skunk!
And your heart is full of unwashed socks.
Your soul is full of gunk,
Mr. Grinch!

The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote,
"Stink, stank, stunk!"---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
