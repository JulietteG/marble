You wake up early in the morning,
Just another old working day.
But this old world keeps turning,
In the same old way.
Let me take you where the trade winds blow
And the sun is always shining.
And I'll stay with you until you change your mind.

I read a book about the islands
Far away in a coral sea.
All we need is a friendly sailboat,
A good wind, and we're running free.
Let me take you where the trade winds blow
And the sun is always shining.
And I'll stay with you until you change your mind.

I remember days gone by
When people had time for leisure,
Making their stately way across the ocean.

But now, all we do is fly
'Cause we really don't have the time.
And there's only so many hours in a day, they say.
But if you let me take you away.

Well, I guess you're just not listening.
KRLA is on the radio.
Soon you'll be going to work as usual,
Leaving me to dream alone,
Dreaming of where the trade winds blow
And the sun is always shining.
And I'll stay with you until you change your mind.---Lyrics submitted by Stephen.
