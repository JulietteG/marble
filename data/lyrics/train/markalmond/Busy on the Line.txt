Had such a lonely feeling,
Just waiting for you to call.
And it starts to get me thinking,
Did you ever care for me at all?

Each night I spend alone,
Pretending that you really care.
And every time there's a busy on your phone,
You say you were never there.

But tonight is Saturday evening
And I just can't stay home.
Any minute, I'll be leaving.
Tonight is not the night to stay alone.

Maybe somewhere in the night,
I will find a friend or two.
But this time, I've gotta do it right
Instead of waiting here for you.

Maybe I'll try your number one more time.
But if I do, who's kidding who?
There's bound to be a busy on the line.---Lyrics submitted by Stephen.
