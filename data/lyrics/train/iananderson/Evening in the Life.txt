Lyrics and Music By Ian Anderson and James Dodd

Its eight oclock on the west side of town 
And many are lined up to come in.
The lines are long, but the soup is hot.  
A long nights about to begin.

The seasons still change, but a presence remains
With pain written deep on their face.
You wonder sometimes how the people got here,
If theyll ever get out of this place.

An evening in the life of an urban nomad
They still roam tonight;
Theyve found no place to sleep. 

Tommy lives on the east side of town:
A wife, three kids, a place of his own.
A corporate job, that fancy home,
Yet somehow, Tommy still feels so all alone.

The seasons still change, but a presence remains
With pain hidden deep on his face.
He wonders sometimes how he got here,
If hell ever get out of this place.

Caught in the lines,
Caught between the burdens of what we need or want.
Distancing ourselves from Gods word,
We think were so different.

I reach out to lift him up,
knowing this love is not my own.
For Jesus is the truth,
His promise is our home.
