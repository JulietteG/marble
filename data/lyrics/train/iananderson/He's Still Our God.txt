"Be still and know that I am God."  -   Psalms 46:10 

I see you sitting there holding your head down,
With the weight of the world on your shoulders. 
Why do you listen to what the world tells you? 
You know its never, ever enough. 

Have faith.  Listen to me brother. 
Your God knows all your complications (knows all your situation).
Stand up.  Look a little farther.
His love is much greater than that.        
Just be still and know Hes still our God

Hes still our God. Hes still our God.
Thats what Im talking about. Thats what Im talking about.
You wake up in the middle of the night. 
I see you drowning in all your worries. 
Stand up.  Look a little farther.  Greater is He that lives within you.
Just be still and know Hes still our God...

I see you staring at me, thinking what Im saying
Are words youve heard  before. 
Should I remind you of Noah, Joseph, David, or Job;
Is it really that rough?
C 2004, Ian Anderson (BMI)---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
