Lyrics and Music Written By Ian Anderson

I was walking down a lonely back road 
In the middle of a sleepy dream.
Haunted by shadows.  Right before me, 
I saw a holy man from Galilee.

He took me to a place He was bound to show me,
With wide, open fields up on the hill. 
And in the middle, I stood with wonder.
There before me was a host of golden daffodils. 

As I wandered through Gods holy city.  
I saw faces of the love ones Ive known.
My soul sat there longing for nothing.
The Lamb is Worthy, was their favorite song. 

Then, I heard a voice that sound like thunder. 
I heard, Friend its not your time to go.  
But, I was in the middle of wide, open fields. 
I was dancing, dancing with the daffodils.

I was dancing, dancing with the daffodils.
Too busy dancing, dancing with the daffodils.
