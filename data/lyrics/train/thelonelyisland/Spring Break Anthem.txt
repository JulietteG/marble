Alright Spring Breakers, you know what time it is
I'm gonna need all the hot girls to come onto the stage right now
Fellas, let me hear you make some noise

Spring Break y'all
Kings of the pussy, pounding on brewskies
Banging chicks right there in the sand
Bros before hoes and chicks with no clothes and
Slammin' shots and marry a man

Who wanna do a shot? (we do)
I'm gonna get fucked up (me too)
We came for a week, we the kings of the beach
Spread water on the girls (T-shirt see through)
(Cancun) party down
(Lauderdale) another round
(Havasu) crack a brew
Marry a man

Pranks when you're passed out, jokes about roofies
Making girls kiss, marry a man
Giant sombreros, show us your titties
Creatine shakes, marry a man

Spring Break y'all

Oh shit, I'm too fucked up, puke and rally, that's what's up
Booze cruise, raise your glass, snort that coke, off her ass

Two chicks at the dance hall, take it to the damn stalls
Trade these beads for their bra
So-Co in my canteen, got girls jumpin' on a trampoline
Two men bound by the law

Trashing hotel rooms, clogging up toilets
Beer goggles if she's a hag
Planning the menu, picking out flowers
Nailing sluts and writing our vows

Down here it's our time! Springbreakers, let's get fucked up
Then find Mister Right and get monogamous
Picking our invite font as a twosome
Something tasteful but not too bland
Seating arrangements, charming the in-laws
Ripping beer bongs, sex with a man

We'll be so happy, true love forever
Two kings walking hand in hand
Promise to cherish, trust and respect him
Crushing pussy, marry a man
