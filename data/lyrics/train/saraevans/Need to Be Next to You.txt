Been running from these feelings for so long,
Telling my heart I didn't need you,
Pretending I was better off alone.
But I know that is just a lie.

So afraid to take a chance again;
So afraid of what I feel inside.

(chorus:)
But I need to be next to you. (Need to be next to you.)
oh, I oh, I
I need to share every breath with you. (Share every breath with you.)
oh, I oh, I
I need to know I can see your smile each morning,
Look into your eyes each night,
For the rest of my life.
Here with you; near with you.
oh I
I need to be next to you.
(need to be next to you)

Right here with you is  where I belong.
I lose my mind if I can't see you.
Without you there's nothing in this life
That would make life worth living for.
I can't bare the thought of you not there;
I can't fight what I feel anymore.

(chorus)

I need to have your heart next to mine
For all time.
Love you for all my life.
I need to be next to you.

(chorus)
I need to feel you in my arms, baby!
oh, I oh, I (x2)
I need to be next to you.
oh, I oh I---Lyrics submitted by Georgette.
