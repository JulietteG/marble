O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
Come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God, all glory in the highest

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning
Jesus, to Thee be glory given
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ, the Lord---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
