No strangers in this town, no body moves without makin' a sound
You live and die within the borders and lines
No one dies without payin' their fines

No lovers in this town, the moon's full but it sure ain't round
And just because you lie in his bed 
Don't mean he meant the things he said

They marry young in these parts
They work the factories
So I ran as fast as I could 
Through the tall grass and the midnight wood
So no one would sing some Bible Song over me

My cousin died in his sleep,
Forty pills, two kids to keep
How will she explain to those kids 
About the sorry thing that he did

They marry young in these parts,
They raise their kids and set them free
So I ran as fast as I could 
Through the tall grass and the midnight wood
So no one would sing some Bible Song over me

They buried him out in the cold
He was only twenty-four years old
And how his mother came undone
When the choir sang "Hallelujah!"

So I ran as fast as I could 
Through the tall grass and the midnight wood
Yeah, I ran as fast as I could 
Through the tall grass and the midnight wood

Hallelujah, Hallelujah...---Lyrics submitted by kel.
