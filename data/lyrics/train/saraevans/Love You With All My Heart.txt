I can feel you watchin', I can feel your eyes on me
I can hear you whisper and I just get so weak
But I'm a little bit scared, it's been a long time
Since I let my guard down and let someone inside
You don't need to wonder, 'cause tonight you'll get it all

Chorus
When the night closes in, I'm gonna pull you so close
Hold you so tight, gonna let it all go
And you can do what you want, you can take me right here
'Cause I knew from the start I was gonna love you with all my heart

You take my hand now, and I'm ready to begin
Though it makes me crazy when your fingers touch my skin
And I know what you want and you know what I need
There's no reason to pretend that we don't know what this means

>>repeat chorus

I'm gonna rock you, baby
And take away your maybe
And you can rest here in these open arms

>>repeat chorus

I was gonna love you with all my heart
I was gonna love you with all my heart
I can feel you watchin', I can feel your eyes on me
