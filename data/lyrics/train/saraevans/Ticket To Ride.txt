On a morning flight out of Birmingham he started talking
Shed never even met him, but Lord, she thought that
Hed never shut up
If she didnt look up
And pay attention
So she took off her headphones
Closed her book
And started listening

He said I just broke up with my girlfriend yesterday
In a Dear John note she said Im moving to L.A.
Im calling it off
Im taking the dog
And dont try to follow
She thinks she's a big star now
She made the Hollywood round
Of American Idol
Thirty minutes later she felt sorry for him a little
She moved from her seat on the aisle to the middle

Buckle up, here comes love
Looks like cupid just showed up
Let him on
Let him by
Give him room
But dont ask why
Cause love dont need no ticket to ride

She said I just cant believe someone would leave a man like you
You seem like a good one, in these days there are so few
Lord knows Ive tried
To find a decent guy
But its hard to do
The way I hate to shop
And how I love football
Youd think Id have two
A second glass of wine just over the Rockies
They didnt see the signs but it was plain as plain can be

Buckle up, here comes love
Looks like cupid just showed up
Let him on
Let him by
Give him room
But dont ask why
Cause love dont need no ticket to ride

Arrive in LAX, waitin' on their bus
He says "What happens next?" and she said "Do you have to ask?"

Buckle up, here comes love
Looks like cupid just showed up
Let him on
Let him by
Give him room
And dont ask why
Cause love dont need no ticket to ride

Buckle up, here comes love
Looks like cupid just showed up
Let him on
Let him by
Give him room
Dont ask why
Cause love dont need no
Love dont need no ticket to ride ---Lyrics submitted by Chloe Kallberg.
