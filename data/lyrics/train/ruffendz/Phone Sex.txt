Hmm, yeah
(I miss you baby)
I been missin' you
(It's so hard bein' away from you)
Girl, I been missin' you, baby
(Mmm, I want you next to me so bad)
I been thinking about you girl
(I miss you so much girl)

I never felt loneliness like this before
I'm so paranoid
Thinkin' you gonna walk through the door
Girl my heart has so much pain to endure
It's been hurting for so long 'til it feels sore

Girl I don't wanna hurt no more
You're everything worth living for
So baby come back to me
You belong with me naturally
Take me outta my misery
Girl I'm going crazy

Girl I been missing you, like crazy
Every minute seems like hours
Every day seems like weeks
Girl I been missing you, like crazy
Every minute seems like hours
Every day seems like weeks

Girl I been missing you, like crazy
Every minute seems like hours
Every day seems like weeks
Ooh girl, I'm missing you
(Ooh girl, I'm missing you)
You know I'm wanting to
Spend every moment with you

Girl it's been so long since I seen your face
And I'm feeling so out of place
The touch of your fingertips on my back
As we make contact, didn't I react

To the chills you send through my vains
Girl just the thought of you drive me insane
Girl I can't wait to feel that feeling again
It's your sweet love, I'm missing

Repeat 1

[Spoken]
Girl, I'm missing you like crazy
I don't know what it is about you
Each moment without you
Seems like forever babe
I just need to be next to you
And until I'm next to you
I'll be missin' you babe

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I been missing you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, the days have been so long
I been missing you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I been thinkin' about cheatin' Mrs. Jones
I been missing you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Said I'm lost without you baby
Oh baby, baby
I been missing you
I been missing you baby---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
