Baby, i'm amazed at the way you love me all the time,
and maybe i'm afraid of the way i leave you.

maybe i'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time,
you hung me on the line.
maybe i'm amazed at the way i really need you.

baby, i'm a man, maybe i'm a lonely man
who's in the middle of something
that he doesn't really understand.

baby, i'm a man,
and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me.
baby, won't you help me to understand?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh.

baby, i'm a man, maybe i'm a lonely man
who's in the middle of something
that he doesn't really understand.

baby, i'm a man,
and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me.
baby, won't you help me to understand?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

maybe i'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time,
maybe i'm afraid of the way leave you.

maybe i'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song,
right me when i'm wrong-
maybe i'm amazed at the way i really need you. ---
