Fade, you fade out tonight
Taking me to that place, each and every time
The memories call, like a voice in the air

And every time I hear it, I see you again
Always out of the reach, cause you're only in my head

Bare feet sunning on the dashboard
Hearts racing on the backroads
I got pictures of you in mind
Killing me slowly that you're not around
Heart feeling like a ghost town
I got pictures of you in my mind

I wonder where you are tonight
Do the tears still fall?
Am I kept out of sight?

When I'm dreaming I run, run, run to be with you again
But you're always out of reach, cause it's only in my head

Bare feet sunning on the dashboard
Hearts racing on the backroads
I got pictures of you in mind
Killing me slowly that you're not around
Heart feeling like a ghost town
I got pictures of you in my mind

How did I get feeling so low
The pictures fade but they won't let me go

Bare feet sunning on the dashboard
Hearts racing on the backroads
I got pictures of you in mind
Killing me slowly that you're not around
Heart feeling like a ghost town
I got pictures of you in my mind---
