This time, I will rise, do or die,
This time, Ill re-ignite, stand and fight
This time, I will love people cause 
Its a must from above, this time

I was broke, off the road up in smoke, all alone
Saw my pain know my name, made a way
I made a turn, hit the curb, I should a died
Someone came, came for me, I can see, now Im free!!

Standing on a hope
Had know where to go
Its supernatural how you saved me

Lost without a prayer
When no one seemed to care
Its supernatural how you saved me

The supernatural, its supernatural


This time Ill be light I will shine, 
This time Ill re-unite stop the lies
This time I will fall in your arms
Sing the psalms of 91 this time (this time)

I thought it was over,
I thought I was done
Stuck in a shadow of what Ive become

I wouldnt listen I couldnt breathe
Lost my vision -now I can see - you came for me

Standing on a hope
Had know where to go
Its supernatural how you saved me

Lost without a prayer
When no one seemed to care
Its supernatural how you saved me

You showed me the light
When I was blind
Your supernatural 

I thought it was over
I thought I was done

I thought it was over
I thought I was
I thought it was over
I thought I was

I thought it was over
I thought I was done

You came for me

Standing on a hope
Had know where to go
Its supernatural how you saved me

Lost without a prayer
When no one seemed to care
Its supernatural how you saved me

The supernatural, its supernatural---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
