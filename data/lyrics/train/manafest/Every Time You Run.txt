[Verse 1:]
Last night got a little crazy
I don't remember, woke up spun with the pasties
My friends say I was tweaked out,
Passed out on a dirty coach, still in the house
It kind a scares me, I don't know
Am out of control, always waking up still in my clothes
I wrote a note that said goodbye to pain, good bye to shame
But couldn't find a way, I just cry for days
I'm so depressed, soak in wet, I can't rest
These thoughts just beat me to death I'm un-kept
I thought of a song my mom used to sing in church
But it's been so long I can't remember the words

[Chorus:]
Every time you run, every time you hide
Every time it hurts, every time you cry
Every time you run away, every time you hide your face
And it feels so far away, I'm right here, with you

Every time you run

[Verse 2:]
I keep sleeping in don't want to wake up
I keep hearing from the landlord pay up
Hide my face in my pillow till the sunsets
Hung over and I haven't seen a pay check
I took a job downtown at the factory
I was hired and fired with no salary
I keep running from responsibility
It's seems impossible, the pressure is hitting me
I know I need to man up, or sit down
Stand up and get out of this crowd
I thought of a song my mom used to sing in church
But it's been so long I can't remember the words

[Chorus:]
Every time you run, every time you hide
Every time it hurts, every time you cry
Every time you run away, every time you hide your face
And it feels so far away, I'm right here, with you

[Verse 3:]
Well I know I'm not ready to die, But I've
Sure thought about the meaning of life
Cause I can't seem to find a purpose for me
It's just the choices and I fail to proceed
I got a "get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
I hear voices in my mind, ones a devil, ones Jesus
I can feel it can you help me find the pieces
Like an angel on my shoulder, you hold the
Joy of the lord raising up a soldier
You gave me the song my mom used to sing in church
I promised not to quit and I remembered the words
I promised not to quit and I remembered the words
