It's not over till it's over 

I stand and face the day 
I rise and ride the wave 
Half the battle's been won 
'Cause I believe it can be done 
Oh, I believe 

I might fall down but I get back up 
I'm gonna pull my weight and I'll push my luck 
I'm gonna stand and fight, and give it all I can 
This is not the end 
It's not over  
Till it's over 
It's not over  
Till it's over 

I can't change the past 
But tomorrow is coming fast 
I'm too close now to give in  
I won't stop now until I win 
For you I'm gonna win 

I might fall down but I get back up 
I'm gonna pull my weight and I'll push my luck 
I'm gonna stand and fight, and give it all I can 
This is not the end 
It's not over  
Till it's over 
It's not over  
Till it's over 

I might be down, but don't count me out 
It's not over till it's over 
I might be down, but I'll turn it around 
It's not over till it's over 
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no 
It's not over 
Till it's over 
It's not over  
Till it's over 

I might fall down, but I get back up 
I'm gonna pull my weight and push my luck 
I'm gonna stand and fight, and give it all I can 
This is not the end 
It's not over  
Till it's over 
It's not over 
Till it's over 

It's not over 
It's not over 
It's not over 
Till it's over  
Till it's over 
Till it's over---
