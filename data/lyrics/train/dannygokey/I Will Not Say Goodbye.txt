Sometimes the road just ends
It changes everything you've been
And all that's left to be
Is empty, broken, lonely, hoping
I'm supposed to be strong
I'm supposed to find a way to carry on

I don't want to feel better
I don't want to not remember
I will always see your face
In the shadows of this haunted place
I will laugh, I will cry, shake my fist at the sky
But I will not say goodbye

They keep saying time will heel
But the pain just gets more real
The sun comes up each day
Finds me waiting, failing, hating, praying
If I could keep on holding on
Maybe I could keep my heart from knowing that your gone

I don't want to feel better
I don't want to not remember
I will always see your face
In the shadows of this haunted place
I will laugh, I will cry, shake my fist at the sky
But I will not say goodbye

I will curse, I will pray, I will live everyday
I will shoulder the pain 
I will shout out your name
I will laugh, I will cry, shake my fist at the sky
But I will not say goodbye

Will not say, goodbye
Will not say goodbye
Will not say goodbye
Ohhhhh---Lyrics submitted by Alisha Thacker.
