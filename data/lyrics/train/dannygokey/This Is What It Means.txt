I've built some dreams  
I've held them close 
Celebrated perfect days 
I lost the one i loved the most 
Now she's 6 feet of earth away 

I've cried til I thought I couldn't stop 
and I've laughed until it hurt 
and I've prayed in an empty parking lot 
and my friends were my church 

Sometimes the joy can give you wings to fly 
Sometimes the pain will cut you so just like a knife 
There's fear, there's faith, there's loss, there's grace  
I've seen it from both sides 
This is what it means to be alive, alive 
This is what it means to be alive 

I've seen the face of have to have 
Of a child without a home 
A casualty of circumstance  
Written off and all alone 
I've cried for the wars that they've been through 
and i've walked by their side 
I've watched what the power of love can do 
and how it changes lives 

Sometimes the joy can give you wings to fly 
Sometimes the pain will cut you so just like a knife 
There's fear, there's faith, there's loss, there's grace  
I've seen it from both sides 
This is what it means to be alive, alive 
This is what it means to be alive 

This is what it means, this is what it means, this is what it means to be alive, alive. 

This is what it means, yeah 

Sometimes the joy can give you wings to fly 
Sometimes the pain will cut you so just like a knife 
There's fear, there's faith, there's loss, there's grace  
I've seen it from both sides 

This is what it means to be alive---
