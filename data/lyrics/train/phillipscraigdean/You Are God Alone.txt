You are not a God created
by human hands 
You are not a God dependent
on any mortal man
You are not a God in need of 
anything we can give
by your plan 
thats just the way it is 

You are not a God created
by human hands
You are not a God dependent
on any mortal man
You are not a God in need of 
anything we can give 
by your plan
thats just the way it is

You are God alone
from before time began
You are on  your throne 
You are God alone
and right now
in the good times and bad
you are on your throne 
you are God alone

Your the only God whose power 
none can contend
your the only God whose name and praise
will never end
your the only God whose worthy 
of everything we can give
You are God 
and thats just the way it is 

You are God alone
from before time began 
You are on your throne 
You are God alone
and right now
in the good times and bad
you are on your throne
you are God alone

Unchangeable
Unshakeable
Unstoppable
Thats what you are 

Unchangeable
Unshakeable
Unstoppable
Thats what you are

You are God alone 
From before time began
you are on your throne
You are God alone

and right now
in the good times and bad
you are on your throne
you are God alone

Unchangeable
Unshakeable 
Unstoppable
Thats what You are---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
