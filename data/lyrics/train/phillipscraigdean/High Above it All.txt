I've come to seek Your face, I long for You
You are my hiding place, my safe refuge
I find my hope in You
Your peace, it carries me through

Grace deeper than the sea, conquered the grave
You gave it all for me, Your love displayed
There is power in Your name
I give You all my praise

Waters roar and mountains fall
You remain high above it all
You are high above it all
Kingdoms rage and nations shake
You remain high above it all
You are high above it all, Almighty God

I've walked through death's valley, I will not fear
Your blood it covers me, You are my shield
When I'm weary and I'm weak
You are all the strength I need

Waters roar and mountains fall
You remain high above it all
You are high above it all
Kingdoms rage and nations shake
You remain high above it all
You are high above it all, Almighty God

There is triumph in Your presence
Healing in Your peace
So I will lift my voice, proclaiming victory
Victory, victory

You are Almighty God, Almighty God
You are Almighty God, Almighty
There is no one greater than You
Almighty God---
