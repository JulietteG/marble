Father i see that you are drawing a line in 
the sand
And i want to be standing on you side, 
holding your hand 
So let your kingdom come, let it live in me 
This is my prayer, this is my plea

Father i see that you are drawing a line in 
the sand
And i want to be standing on you side, 
holding your hand 
So let your kingdom come, let it live in me 
This is my prayer, this is my plea

[Chorus]
Let the worshipers arise 
Let the sons and the daughters sing
I surrender in my all 
I surrender to the king

Let the worshipers arise 
Let the sons and the daughters sing
I surrender in my all 
I surrender to the king

Father i hear it growing louder 
The song of your redeemed
As the saints of every nation 
Are awakening to sing
From our hearts there comes an anthem
Oh, hear the heavens ring
This is our song, a song to our King!

[Chorus]
Let the worshipers arise 
Let the sons and the daughters sing
I surrender in my all 
I surrender to the king
