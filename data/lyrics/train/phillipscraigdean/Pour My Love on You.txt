(verse)

I don't know how
To say exactly how I feel.
I can't begin
To tell you what your love has meant
I'm lost for words.
Is there a way to show the passion in my heart
Can I express
How truly great I think you are
My dearest friend

(Bridge)

Lord this is my desire
To pour my love on you

(Chorus)

Like oil upon you feet
Like wine for you to drink
Like water from my heart
I pour my love on you
If praise is like perfume
I'll lavish mine on you
Til every drop is gone
I pour my love on you

(Verse)

Is there a way 
To show the passion in my heart
Can I express
How truly great I think you are
My dearest friend

(repeat bridge)

Lord this is my desire
To pour my love on you

(repeat chorus 2)

Lilke oil upon your feet
Like wine for you to drink
Like water from my heart
I pour my love on you
If praise is like perfume
I'll lavish mine on you
Til every drop is gone
I'll pour my love on you
I'll pour my love on you
Yeah, Yeah Ow Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
