I met a girl and I really thought she liked me
I truly thought that I had met the one
It was a fail, To know a fail
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

She's like a witch casting her spell; hypnotizing
She made me drink a potion just to fall in love
She got me drunk and tipsy off her love
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

Hey(x4)

She's always blowing up my phone
I really wish that she'd leave me alone
I gotta change my number
Hard for me to slumber
When she's outside my home

She called the cops and made it seem like I was mean
She's not your average lady, She is fucking crazy
Spelled C U N T

And after all
The rise and fall
You're not worth my time

I'm c-c-calling it quits
Right now, This time
You're playing games
And all we do, Is fight
It's getting late so,
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie Oxen free
All the Bad Girls come cheer with me
Your loves a drug, You got me on the run
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

Hey(4x)

I'm always paranoid
That she's somehow watching me
Follows me on Twitter
Asking if I miss her
Hashtag set me free

She Google's my name
Just to keep some tabs on me
She's not your average lady, She is fucking crazy
Someone help me please

And after all
The rise and fall
You're not worth my time

I'm c-c-calling it quits
Right now, This time
You're playing games
And all we do, Is fight
It's getting late so,
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie Oxen free
All the Bad Girls come cheer with me
Your loves a drug, You got me on the run
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

(Ronnie)
All right, All right, All right
Settle down, Settle down
I need all my bad girls in the house tonight to help me do a cheer
It goes: 1, 2, 3, 4!

(Bad Girls)
Hey sexy boy I got you wrapped around my finger
L O V E Really doesn't mean much

(Ronnie)
You're always like a drug
But it is not enough

(Bad Girls)
Give me a B A D
Were the Bad Girls Club!
Hey sexy boy I got you wrapped around my finger
L O V E Really doesn't mean much

(Ronnie)
You're always like a drug
But it is not enough

(Bad Girls)
Give me a B A D
Were the Bad Girls Club! Yay!

I'm c-c-calling it quits
Right now, This time
You're playing games
And all we do, Is fight
It's getting late so,
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie Oxen free
All the Bad Girls Club's here with me
And off the track, You got me on the rug
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

Hey
Just another victim of the Bad Girls Club---Lyrics submitted by Andrea Keith.
