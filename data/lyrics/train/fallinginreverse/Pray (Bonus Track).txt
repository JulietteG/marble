I was raised in a house with a dark cloud over it 
I just wanted to get out and see the sun again 
But no matter where I went, it followed me around 
I guess it's just my luck, forever 

So I pray for the day that the rain will come and wash away 
All the pain that I face 
It's getting way too hard to take 
I'll run away, run away, run away 
It's getting way too hard to take 
I'll run away 

It's always me versus myself and it's always in my mind 
And the saddest part of all is knowing it won't die 
I have gotten close with pain like a blade across my skin 
But the scars, they still remain forever 

My past seems to haunt me 
My future is blurry 
My addictions, they taught me 
No matter what happens but I'm not sorry for the things I've done 
They made me the person I am now 
It made me the person I am now 

But I'm not sorry 
But I'm not sorry---
