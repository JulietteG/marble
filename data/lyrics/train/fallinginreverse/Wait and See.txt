Woah
This is what we've become

Calling all cards it's an emergency, listen
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at the end of existence
The television is fiction, it's telling lies to our vision
It's like a prison that we live in and we're all in the system
We live in a box and keep our family traditions
We keep our guns cocked, stocked up with more ammunition
We teach our children to kill instead of teaching them wisdom
And politicians waging wars, blame it all on religion

We're dying
I'm feeling like I am losing it again
The only person that we're losing is yourself to this
I'm trying to be all that they want me to be
But it's hard to believe we are the enemy

Will you wait and see
When the world stops spinning and we're all pretending to be okay
But it's hard to be when you find out it's fake
Humanity is trapped in a prison
Open up your eyes, see the vision
Wait and see
When the world stops spinning, I won't stop pretending to be okay

Calling all people, we're in a state of confusion
Because we hate what we love, and it's like a drug, we abuse it
And we're pollutant solutions we're all equal as humans
Truly united we stand, damn let's connect through the music
And all this hatred I'm seeing but it's all an illusion
People using social media to hurt us, it's stupid
All these kids just feel the need to cut themselves on their wrists
The type of shit their parents miss because they're losing their grip

What in the hell have we done to ourselves?
Brick by brick we built this cell
We are nothing left but a hollow shell
Hollow shell

Wait and see
When the world stops spinning and we're all pretending to be okay
But it's hard to be when you find out it's fake

Will you wait and see
When the world stops spinning and we're all pretending to be okay
But it's hard to be when you find out it's fake
Humanity is trapped in a prison
Open up your eyes, see the vision
Wait and see
When the world stops spinning, I won't stop pretending to ...
When the world stops spinning, I won't stop pretending to be okay
But it's hard to be when you find out it's fake---
