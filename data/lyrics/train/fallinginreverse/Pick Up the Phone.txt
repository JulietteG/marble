Pick up the phone!
Answer your texts
Well I apologize about last night
I really did not mean to disrespect

You
You better be alone!
No I'm not obsessed
But you know if I catch you with somebody else
You know that I'm gonna be upset

I truly believe
That the reason I'm here
Is to tell you the truth
Your ending is here
One day you must look at yourself in mirror
Oh I still don't think you are hearing me clear!
You must understand that our friendship is done
Justified by the person that you have become
And because of the fact that enough is enough!
You are the one that is holding the gun!

Whoa
This will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal
I have loved you so much that it hurts me dear
And this will be the end of us!

Pick up the phone!
Pick up the phone!
Pick up the phone!
Well I apologize about last night
I really did not mean to disrespect

Pick yourself up
Up off the floor
Wipe the tears up off your face
Cause the cops are knocking on the door
They're gonna wanna know what's up!

Better tell them that you fell
Cause when they see the bruises on my face
They're probably gonna take us both to jail

I'm sick and tired of fighting each other
The lying, the crying, the calling your mother
The calling of names, we bother each other
We kiss and make up, get under the covers
A dangerous cycle I don't understand
The kicking, the screaming, the breaking of limbs
I'll be damned if I see you with some other man
If I cannot have you, then nobody can!

Whoa
This will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal
I have loved you so much that it hurts me dear
And this, this will be the end of us!

Death do us part
I thought you would never go stray
From my heart
I'm better off without you!

Pick up your phone!
*Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system*
Pick up your phone!
Pick up the phone!

Whoa
This will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal
I have loved you so much that it hurts me dear
And this, this will be the end of us!

Pick up the phone!
Pick up the phone!
Pick up the phone!

Well I apologize about last night
I really did not mean to disrespect

*We're sorry the number you have dialed is not in service at this time,
Fuck you! *---Lyrics submitted by jonathan.
