Walk away from all the pain
Found the piece within again
And after all I've seen, and everything in between
My heart's the one to blame

My heart's to blame
So where do we all go from here?
It's time to say goodbye, you're on your own
And this is where I disappear
So turning back is what I hate the most
It doesn't matter anyway
I guess there's nothing left to say
It's time to say goodbye, you're on your own

I run away from my mistakes
Crashed and burned but I'm okay
The most important thing, learning what
My heart's the one to blame---
