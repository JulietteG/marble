(Verse 1)

My words cut just like razor blades
I'm just like a hand grenade
you pulled the pin now you're too late
excuse me while I detonate 
you live the life of luxury
deep down inside your misery
subsides and thrives for company
now morally you're crumbling 

(Chorus)

Goddamn need some help
I can't help myself
'Cause my girlfriend's in love with somebody else
Goddamn it's too bad
really wished it would last
always wanting what I'll neer have
So Goddamn

(Verse 2)

I must forgive I hesitate
excuse me while i separate 
you lived the life and lied to me
I gave you almost everything
I wore my heart upon my sleeve
I gave you almost all of me..

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

Goddamn need some help
I can't help myself
My girlfriend's in love with someone else.
Goddamn it, what the fuck?

Goddamn need some help
my girlfriend's in love with someone else
Goddamn it's too bad
really wished it would last
always wanting what
I'll never have so goddamn.---Lyrics submitted by steph randall.
