I heard a knock upon my door the other day
I opened it to find death staring in my face
the feel of mortal stalking still reverberates
everywhere I go I drag this coffin just in case 

My body's tremble it sends shivers down my spine
adrenaline kicks and shifts into overdrive,
your secrets keep you sick your lies keep you alive
snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice
I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
the kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house
I wrestle with my thoughts I shook the hand of doubt
running from my past i'm praying feet don't fail me now!

I've lost my god damn mind, 
it happens all the time,
I cant believe I'm actually
meant to be here,
trying to consume,
the drug in me is you
and I'm so high on misery
cant you see!

I got these questions always running through my head
so many things that I would like to understand
if we are born to die and we all die to live
then whats the point of living life if it just contradicts?
I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
the kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house
I wrestle with my thoughts I shook the hand of doubt
running from my past i'm praying feet don't fail me now!

I've lost my god damn mind
it happens all the time
I cant believe I'm actually
meant to be here
trying to consume,
the drug in me is you
and I'm so high on misery
cant you see!

I've lost
myself
you tried to reach me but you just cant help me
so long
goodbye
you tried to save me it wont work this time!

cause now

I've lost my fucking mind
and there's no fucking time
I can't believe I'm actually
meant to be here
trying to consume,
the drug in me is you
and I'm so high on misery
can't you see?---Lyrics submitted by Rodell.
