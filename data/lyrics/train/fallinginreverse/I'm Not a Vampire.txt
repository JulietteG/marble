Well I'm not a vampire
But I feel like one
Sometimes I sleep all day
Because I hate the sunlight
My hands are always shaking
Bodies always aching
In the darkness when I feed

Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed
With me
And Whiskey seems to be my Holy Water
Mothers better lock your doors
And hide your daughters

I'm insane!
Well, I can feel it in my bones!
Coursing through my veins!
When did I become so cold?

For goodness sake!
Where is my self control?
If home is where my heart is
Then my heart has lost all hope

Well I'm not a zombie
But I feel like one today!
Sell me pills, Comatose!
Chemical daze!
My head is always spinning
From this dizzy blurry vision
And my stomach has had enough!
I feel like a lady
That is pregnant with a baby
Cause I'm always throwing up!

Hi, My name is Ronnie!
I'm an addict!
*Hi, Ronnie! *
Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath!

I'm insane!
Well, I can feel it in my bones!
Coursing through my veins!
When did I become so cold?

For goodness sake!
Where is my self control?
If home is where my heart is
Then my heart has lost all hope

God bless all of you now!
Cause I'm going straight to Hell!
And I'm taking you down with me!
Cause you know damn well,

I'm insane!
Well, I can feel it in my bones!
Coursing through my veins!
When did I become so cold?

I'm insane!
Well, I can feel it in my bones!
Coursing through my veins!
When did I become so cold?

For goodness sake!
Where is my self control?
If home is where my heart is
Then my heart has lost all hope---Lyrics submitted by shorty.
