I know I planted flowers
But look around at all my weeds 
I don't play well with others 
The thought occurred it might be me 

I'm so bitter I can taste it (taste it)

I'm not allowed to leave 
But I'm not allowed to stay 
Everything is free 
But you say I gotta pay 

Ask me what I think 
'Cause I got a lot to say 
I know it's gonna hurt 
But there is no other way 

I'll try 
'Til I die 
To break what's yours 
And take what's mine 

Envy is a problem 
And karma knows where you live 
You will not consume me 
I'll throw you out before I'll give 

I'm so bitter I can taste it (taste it)

I'm not allowed to leave 
But I'm not allowed to stay 
Everything is free 
But you say I gotta pay 

Ask me what I think 
'Cause I got alot to say 
I know it's gonna hurt 
But there is no other way

I'll try 
'Til I die 
To break what's yours 
And take what's mine 
(Repeat)

I won't give in (9x)

I know I planted flowers 
But look around at all my weeds 
I don't play well with others 
The thought occurred it might be me

I'll try 
'Til I die 
To break what's yours 
And take what's mine 
(Repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
