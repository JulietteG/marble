I only miss you when you call
So please dont pick up the phone again
In the confusion of it all
Give me time
While my minds unravelling

I just cant escape this feeling
But its taking over me
All over me

I know now I cant try to hide it
Its clear to me that I cant fight it

You wanna take it back to where it was
But I cant make this over
I cant make this over
You want another chance to try again
But I cant make this over
I cant make this over
Now

Dont say I dont miss the way we were
I thought nothing could tear us apart
Why do you have to sabotage our love
And leave me with a broken heart?

You think, that I wont forgive you
Its far beyond a breakup
Kiss and make up

I know now that its not about you
I know that I cant live without you

You wanna take it back to where it was
But I cant make this over
I cant make this over
You want another chance to try again
But I cant make this over
I cant make this over

And now Ill follow my heart
And now youre out of my life
And now

You wanna take it back to where it was
But I cant make this over
I cant make this over
You want another chance to try again
But I cant make this over
I cant make this over [x2]
