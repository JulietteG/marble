Are you ready for the time of your life?
Its time to stand up and fight
Hand in hand, well take a caravan to the motherland
One by one, we gonna stand up with pride
One that cant be denied

Now the children of the world can see
There is a better place for us to be
The place in which we were born
So neglected and torn apart

Every woman, every man join the caravan of love
Stand up
Everybody take a stand join the caravan of love
Stand up

Hes my brother
Hes my brother, dont you know?
Im your sister
Im your sister, dont you know?

Well be living in a world of peace
And the day when everyone is free
Well bring the young and the old
Wont you let your love flow, from your heart?

Every woman, every man join the caravan of love
Stand up
Everybody take a stand join the caravan of love
Stand up

Hes my brother
Hes my brother, dont you know?
Im your sister
Im your sister, dont you know?

Every woman, every man join the caravan of love
Stand up---
