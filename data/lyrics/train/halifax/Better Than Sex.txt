In this bottle, I'm all dressed up for you
In red, my intentions aren't so good
It may take me one miracle
But if you have more I'm sure we could use them

So why do we (why do we), breathe sex like lovers but live like enemies?

Fix me, fix me a new cure for us
One that's stronger
One that will ease the pain
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be there right next to you

As I spread throughout your veins
The tension's getting stronger now with pain
You can have your miracle
But I won't give in to your throne
Royalty means nothing to me

Still why do we (why do we), breathe sex like lovers but live like enemies?

Fix me, fix me a new cure for us
One that's stronger
One that will ease the pain
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be there right next to you

Let's sleep tonight on a bed of nails
So that every other night doesn't seem so painful after all (after all)
Let's sleep tonight on a bed of nails
So that every other night doesn't seem so painful after all (after all) after all

Fix me, fix me a new cure for us
One that's stronger
One that will ease the pain
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be there right next to you

Fix me, fix me a new cure for us
One that's stronger
One that will ease the pain
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be there right next to you

Fix me, fix me a new cure for us
One that's stronger
One that will ease the pain
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be there right next to you---Lyrics submitted by janet.
