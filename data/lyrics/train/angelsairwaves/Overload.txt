Eyes
Wait
Go
Lights
Don't
Haunt
Through
The night

Everybody's coming to be shown
(We see it in your eyes)
Just like that feeling when you run
(We see it everytime)
Come close find someone that you know
(We all enjoy the pain[?])
This spark is burning up the firehouse again

Your lie

When you see it, do you overload?
Do you feel like you should close your eyes?
Everybody to the great unknown
Feet first, jumping in front of the line
When you see it, do you overload?
Can you feel it? Cause you bite your tongue
Every minute is an episode
Took a girl to marry into the night

Everybody is waiting on the rain
(We see it in your eyes)
Held down and high above the fold
(We see it everytime)
Come close, find anyone you can
(We all enjoy the pain ...
This spark is burn right down the fucking house again

When you see it, do you overload?
Do you feel like you should close your eyes?
Everybody to the great unknown
Feet first, jumping in front of the line
When you see it, do you overload?
Can you feel it? Cause you bite your tongue
Every minute is an episode
Took a girl to marry into the night---
