They're down the alley, waiting for me
Just set the dial to the radio free
That intelligent band in the run
Pick them up with the sound of your guns

Call him in to the white of the eyes
Watch him dance when he kicks you aside
Chat her up in a forbidden tone
I got you, with your heart in the hand

A ritual, the words creep out
Like a ghost, the heart sinks down
An animal with teeth, reach out
Holding on, we're coming up strong again

We dance like bullets in the wind
Over and over again, over and over again
Bringing life back from the dead
Keeping the captain alive
Over and over we go, over and over we go
So turn up the transistor radio

Drama, trouble, give me some more
Cutting deep, going down to the core
Great Scott, the kids in the rain
They come together, with the sound of a change

Shut them up, with a four letter word
Bite your thumb, the car's going to swerve
Sound and colour, the crowd, city lights
Hurry up, this kid's in a fight 

A ritual, the words creep out
Like a ghost, the heart sinks down
An animal with teeth, reach out
Holding on, we're coming up strong again

We dance like bullets in the wind
Over and over again, over and over again
Bringing life back from the dead
Keeping the captain alive
Over and over we go, over and over we go
So turn up the transistor radio 

Pick up the beat and drive up with caskets
And call in the masses, and turn up the song
Shuffle the beat, and mix with the blackness
Rise up from the ashes, they're dancing along

A ritual, the words creep out
Like a ghost, the heart sinks down
An animal with teeth, reach out
Holding on, we're coming up strong again

We dance like bullets in the wind
Over and over again, over and over again
Bringing life back from the dead
Keeping the captain alive
Over and over we go, over and over we go
So turn up the transistor radio---
