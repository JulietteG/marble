I want to have the same last dream again
The one where I wake up, and I'm alive
Just as the four walls close me within
My eyes are open up with pure sunlight
I'm the first to know, my dearest friends
Even if your hope has burned with time
Anything thats dead shall be regrown
And your vicious pain, your warning sign, you will be fine

Hey oooh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin

Any type of love, it will be shown
Like every single tree, reach for the sky
If you're going to fall, I'll let you know
That I will pick you up, like you for I
I felt this thing, I can't replace
Where everyone was working for this goal
where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back as pure as gold to recite this all

Hey oooh, Here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin
Tonight, hey ooh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin
Tonight,hey ooh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin

I cannot live, I can't breathe, unless you do this with me[x6]

Hello, here I am (do this with me)
And here we go, life's waiting to begin (do this with me)
Hello, here I am (do this with me)
And here we go, life's waiting to begin
Life's waiting to begin---Lyrics submitted by ipey.
