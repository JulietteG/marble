Do you ever feel like your alone?
Do you ever wish you'd be unknown?
I can say that i have
I can say that i have

Do you ever feel things here arent right?
Do you ever feel that time slipped by?
I can say that i have
I can say that i have

(chorus)
So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
Look for the stars as the sun comes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
Reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
Everything. everything's magic

Do you ever lay awake at night?
Do you ever tell yourself don't try?
Don't try to let yourself down
Don't try to let yourself down

Do you ever see yourself in love?
Do you ever take a chance my love?
Because you know that i will
Because you know that i will

(chorus)
So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
Look for the stars as the sun comes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
Reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic
Everything. everything's magic

(repeat chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
