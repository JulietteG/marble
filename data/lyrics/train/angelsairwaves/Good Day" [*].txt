I should have turned back,
I should have known better,
Than to walk away defeated.

I'll say it tonight,
I'll say it forever.
And this time I really swear I mean it.

Oh, I need you now (need you now).
The Earth fell fast asleep.
This room is safe and sound.
Will you lay here with me,
And feel it?

I think I like today.
I think it's good.
It's something I can't get my head around.

True love is something that comes easy.
Just one kiss, God I swear I want to.
I heard a pin drop and a nervous heartbeat.
Have you ever heard me scream "I love you"?

Oh, I need you now (need you now)
The Earth fell fast asleep.
This room is safe and sound.
Will you lay here with me,
And feel it?

I think I like today.
I think it's good.
It's something I can't get my head around.

I think I like today.
I think it's good.
It's something I can't get my head around.

[Vocals]

*I think I like today.
I think it's good.
It's something I can't get my head around.
