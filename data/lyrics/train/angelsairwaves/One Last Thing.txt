Chalked up in a city street
 Broke glass in bloody scene
 Young guns that are half my age
 Baghdad up to Monterrey
 Cell phones and the magazines
 Death bombs and the human beings
 Hate war and diamond rings
 Nightmares of silly things
 How does anybody sleep at night?
 Out of mind but not out of sight
 Out of love and we just begun
 Livin large in America

 But I found, one last thing
 To believe in
 But I found, one last thing
 To believe in

Close calls and we're holdin on
 Police lines and fire alarms
 High winds with a heavy fall
 Dead birds in a parking stall
 How does anybody sleep at night?
 I lay in bed and I close my eyes
 I kind of rest but it starts to hurt
 Living here is a lot of work

 But I found, one last thing
 To believe in
 But I found, one last thing
 To believe in
 But I found

[Transmission:]
 (Why we's true to breathe in the most righteous breath)
 (A feeling of heartfelt purpose, and a sense of hope)
 But I found
 One last thing
 (For something bigger than ourselves)

[Chorus: x2]
 But I found, one last thing
 To believe in
 But I found, one last thing
 To believe in

To believe in---Lyrics submitted by Rocco.
