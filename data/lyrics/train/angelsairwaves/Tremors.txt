The earth is burning, can't feel my feet
So come on
The floor is sinking, there's holes in the street
Yeah come on
Your eyes are fearing my nightmares to sleep
So come on
Tomorrow's stolen, sharpened my teeth
Yeah come on

I'm a ghost, hesitating
I bide my time at your thrill
Meet me here halfway across elation
I get off this way when I'm in love

Your eyes are poison, you're making me sweat
So come on
I keep a crucifix hung on my neck
Yeah come on
Back to the cradle, you're chasing the rat
So come on
Galactic feedback, that plan of attack
Yeah come on

I'm a ghost, salivating
I crave your soul like my own

Meet me here halfway across the elation
I get off this way when I'm in love
When you scream my name, I feel I'm dying
I get off this way when I'm in love

Ohh, ohh oh
Ohh, ohh oh

Meet me here halfway, across elation
I get off this way when I'm in love
When you scream my name I feel I'm dying
I get off this way when I'm in love

I get off this way when I'm in love---
