Don't you wish for wings to fly
To blow yourself away from the lies
Tell me, don't you dream for will to scream
To keep your grief from mournful colors
Your head out of the water
I just want you to know
We're all feeding illusions,
Aren't we all the same
Hopeless whispers sketching love
From all the shame
We're so much more than noise
We're so much more than noise

Don't you wish for sounds to last
To raise your voice to reach the sky
Tell me, don't you crave for strength to cry
To get your light a drifting blast
A drifting blast

I know that you can't stand those feelings anymore
It's killing you, killing you inside, killing you inside
I know that you can't stand those feelings anymore
It's killing you, killing you inside, killing you inside
It's killing you inside, it's killing you

I just want you to know
We're all feeding illusions,
Aren't we all the same
Hopeless whispers sketching love
From all the shame
We're so much more than noise
We're so much more than noise
We're so much more than noise
We're so much more than noise
We're so much more than noise
Noise
Noise
There's way more, can't you see

I'm wondering if there's a place to lay down
To feel the ground within the wounds of desperation
I've prayed once, got through the door, to touch His crown
Faith is pretty much like pain, hard to let it go all at once
I guess comfort remains somewhere, so much higher
Until we get there, I guess we're nothing
We're nothing but public show, waiting somewhere
For someone else's voice to call us home
To call us home
To call us home
For someone
For someone else's voice
A voice

I just want you to know
We're all feeding illusions,
Aren't we all the same
Hopeless whispers sketching love
From all the shame
We're so much more than noise---
