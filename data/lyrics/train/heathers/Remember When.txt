I remember when, when we sat outside.
Digesting "nourriture" that didn't suit their eyes.
We stood our ground, and took it as a layer to our shells,
And still you laugh at me. Why ?

Remember when, we though we'd known each other all our lives ?
Those are the types, that you, can never really loose.
And when you fell into a trap i knew you more than you knew you.

I need to go, i need to get away from everything. 
I'll have to run to get away from here.
I need to go, i need to get away from everything,
Just for awhile, just for awhile.

And we will slowly, slowly climb, climb over a ladder with no other side.
And we will slowly, slowly climb, climb over a ladder with no other side.


I remember when, when we sat outside.
Digesting "nourriture" that didn't suit their eyes.
We stood our ground, and took it as a layer to our shells,
And still you laugh at me. Why ?

And so i'll be with you one last time,
Just to consider my point of view.
The path on which you walk will never fail to keep you safe,
But it will crumble underneath me, minus you.

I need to go, i need to get away from everything. 
I'll have to run to get away from here.
I need to go, i need to get away from everything,
Just for awhile, just for awhile.---Lyrics submitted by Ava.
