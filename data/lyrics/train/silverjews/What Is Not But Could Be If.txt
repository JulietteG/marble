what is not but could be if
what could appear in the morning mist
with all associated risk
what is not but could be if
what was not but could have been
was my obsession way back when
now I just remember this
what was not but could be if
what was not but could be if

we could be walking 

and your reaching for your very last
once has lived life carelessly
he or she has still to see
that truth is not alive or dead
the truth is struggling to be said

so how do we get out of this
..family shadows all amiss

what was not but could be if
with all associated risk---Lyrics submitted by Rob.
