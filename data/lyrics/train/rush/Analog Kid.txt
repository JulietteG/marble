A hot and windy August afternoon has the trees in constant motion
With a flash of silver leaves as they're rockin in the breeze
The boy lies in the grass with one blade stuck between his teeth
A vague sensation quickens in his young and restless heart
And a bright and nameless vision vision has him longing to depart

You move me, You move me
With your buildings and your eyes, Autumn woods and winter skies
You move me, You move me
Open sea and city lights, Busy streets and dizzy heights
Call me, you call me

The fawn eyed girl with sun browned legs dances on the edge of his dream
And her voice rings in his ears, like the music of the spheres
The boy lies in the grass, unmoving, staring at the sky
His mother starts to call him as a hawk goes soaring by
And the boy throws down his baseball cap and covers up his eyes

You move me, You move me
With your buildings and your eyes, Autumn woods and winter skies
You move me, You move me
Open sea and city lights, Busy streets and dizzy heights
Call me, you call me

Too many hands on my time, too many feelings
Too many things on my mind
When I leave I dont know what I'm hoping to find
And when I leave I dont what I'm leaving behind

When I leave I dont know what I'm hoping to find
And when I leave I dont what I'm leaving behind---Lyrics submitted by john.
