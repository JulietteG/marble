What's the Rumpus?!

I came home late on sunday, the house was a screaming zoo
I couldn't tell if it was a party or a full, on, wrecking crew
Barrels of booze in my bathroom, bodies all over my floor
They were charging me a cover at my own front door

(Chorus)
When the Whole thing's over, there's gonna be hell to pay
'cause when it's upside, downside, inside out
What more can you say?
Hey, Hah! du-du-du dy-uh! Hah, Hey! 
What's the rumpus?(x3)
Cad e an sceil a buachail, What's the rumpus?

A Pack of Peruvian Peddlers, givin' Guinness to the Llamas
One came out of my bedroom, he was wearing my best pajamas
Half a dozen dancers doin' Hornpipes on the bar
Somthing running in the kitchen, and it might've been my car

(Chorus)


Walshies Waltzing with a tree, Pete and Podge were on their backs
Drunken Monkies are drinkin' Drano, and the guards are in the jacks
people hangin' out my windows, bowling down the hall
music loud enough to shake the shingles off the wall

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Conor.
