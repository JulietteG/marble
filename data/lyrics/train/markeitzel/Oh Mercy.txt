Please please invite me to your party
Because I was alone so much when I was young 
I'm a good guest, I could say almost nothing
And I could almost like almost anyone

And I haven't talk to anyone in days
But look, I brought all this imported beer
And it's far too easy to be alone
It's far too easy to disappear

Oh mercy oh mercy
You're  a sight for my sore eyes
You know I just want to believe, honey
The road will rise

And I got party talk for all your party guests
My topic includes fascism and rising crime
And when I outline the coming doom of the USA
Will that ensure everyone's good time 

I'll turn the talk as bright as falling leaves
Like it's a good time even though it's rotten
And I'll lead a drunken cheers to the brave pioneers
Who give all they have and are forgotten

Oh mercy oh mercy
I'm tired of goodbyes
I just wanna believe, honey
The road will rise

I swear they'll love the four dirty jokes I know
I swear I'll hit the kitchen like dynamite
I'll even clean up the mess when I smash my glass
I'm lost, I'm lost but it's all right

Oh mercy oh mercy
Don't look in my sore eyes
I just want to believe, honey
The road will rise

Who who who am I
I'm a gho ho host drifting by---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
