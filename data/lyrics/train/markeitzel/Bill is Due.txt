Who needs the past
It just sticks to your shoe 
You try and move on
But the bill is due 

So you walk away
And you go nowhere 
Your life stumbles on
Without you even there 

Threw away your good luck 
Too good to be true 
You were someone, now you're not 
And the bill is due 

Parties and punchlines 
Makes a life easy to forget 
But you can't rise to the light
When you're full of regret

Don't become a ghost
When your time is through 
The world gives you away
And the bill is due 

A thousand arms hold up the sky 
A thousand hands hold you 
You'll never add up what you owe 
And the bill is due---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
