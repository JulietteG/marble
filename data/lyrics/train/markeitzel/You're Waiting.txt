Like a sailor for the sand
Like a heart for a hand
Like the ocean for the land
You wait

Like a farmer for the rain
Like a devil for a name
Like a party for champagne
You wait

Like a game for the save
Like fortune for the brave
Like debt you forgave
You wait

Like soul for the escape
Like a head for its plate
Like a hero for a cape
You wait

You're waiting
To see if I have a heart

Like a newborn for despair
Like a magician for thin air
Like a cynic for a prayer
you wait

Like salvation for a crook
Like redemption for a book
Like the hope you overlook
You wait

You're waiting
To see if I have a heart

Like a bullet for the pure
Like a poison for the cure
Like a flower for manure
You wait

Likejustice for the lie
Like truth for alibi
Like the ocean for the sky
You wait

You're waiting
To see if I have a heart---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
