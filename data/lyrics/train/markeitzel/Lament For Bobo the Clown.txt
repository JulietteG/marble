No one cares what you lost
Or the rules you keep
Or the breath you hold
On the face of teh deep

You're the clown that can't be drowned
You got to saty high and dry
The world turns its face away
Watch it stumble by

Only 3 for 2, 9 for 5

baby, can we keep it light
No answers, no alibis
Watch the clouds drift
See the dust rise

Only 3 for 2, 9 for 5
Only 3 for 2, 9 for 5

Will you fade like the dawn
Cold and sweet as the rain
When your drreams are gone
Will your love remain---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
