I'm the sad clown that sings
I'm the bad wine the good guest brings
Too self-absorbed for magic
My car is always stuck in trafic

I sleep in an airless cell
I got a rich and deep private hell
Oh why are you with me
Oh why are you with me

I'm white as a lie
Oh why are you with me
I used to say I was bi
Oh why are you with me
Always ready to strike out or hurt
Oh why are you with me
Plus I never take off my short
Oh why are you with me
I am always chewing empty boasts
Oh why are you with me
And plates of cheese and toasts
Oh why are you with me
I claim my music is in demand
Oh why are you with me
I even went to Stonehenge with my band
Oh why are you with me

And I knew from the start
That you could break my heart
You don't laugh at all my jokes
But you wear all my coats
I knew from the start
That you could break my heart
'Cause with you nothing's wrong
'Cause you're where I belong
I knew from the start
That you could break my heart

Romantic comedies and tears
Oh why are you with me
I'm a slave to all my fears
Oh why are you with me
The silhouette of a garden gnome
Oh why are you with me
And I always like to be alone
Oh why are you with me

And I've never been loved 
The way that you love
I've never been loved 
The way that you love---Lyrics submitted by Ligloo.
