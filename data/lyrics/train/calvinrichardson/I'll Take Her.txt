Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah
Listen
Theres a lot of things going on
And every day is growing strong
I want to set the record straight, right in here
Gotta listen to me loud and clear
Im the kind of man that will take a good woman by her hand
Ill wipe her tears away in case you didnt notice Im a little bit country

Chorus:
If you cant treat her right
Let her go on, Ill take her 
(Somebody let me sang this song right here. Dont you try to stop me no)
If you cant love her right
Let her go on, Ill take her 
(Calvin, take your time and sang this, sang this song right here)

Yes you can say Im weak but as long as I got breath in this little old body Im gonna speak it
 You better treat her a little bit sweeter 'cause ill do all the things that it takes to keep her
Dont think of me as your enemy
Call me crazy, call me country 
cause you better treat her right cause if you dont Im gonna love her with all my might, my might, my might

Chorus:
If you cant treat her right
Let her go on, Ill take her 
(Sometimes it may be sad but you gotta do it  let her go)
If you cant love her right
Let her go on, Ill take her 
(Can we get a witness. Somebody, somebody help me and Calvin moan and say)
Shoodoopdoo
(I like the way you sang it)
Shoodoopdoo
Shoodoopdoo
(Sometimes you dont know what to say sometimes)
woowoowoowoo
(All you gotta say is)
Shoodoopdoo
(Oh yeah)
Shoodoopdoo
(When you need me oowee)
Shoodoopdoo
(All you got to do is pick up the phone and call me, call me, call me, call me)
woowoowoowoo

Chorus:
If you cant treat her right
Let her go on, Ill take her 
If you cant love her right
Let her go on, Ill take her
(Somebody, somebody wave your hands. Say yeahhhhh)
Shoodoopdoo
Let her go on
Shoodoopdoo
Ill take her
Shoodoopdoo
woowoowoowoo

Shoodoopdoo
Let her go on
Shoodoopdoo
Ill take her
Shoodoopdoo
woowoowoowoo
(Calvin, I think theyve heard enough)
(No no, no, no Im not ready to go)

Shoodoopdoo
Let her go on
Shoodoopdoo
Ill take her
Shoodoopdoo
woowoowoowoo---Lyrics submitted by D Jones.
