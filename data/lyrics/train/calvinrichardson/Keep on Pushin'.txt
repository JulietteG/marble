MMMMMMM  yeah

Girl i've played but
please forgive me
it's been a few months 
now since i did it 
I don't want to go on living
babe
put it in the past 
i want to make this love last
Listen..

Don't keep on pushin me 
(don't keep doing it)
I just might fall over the 
edge baby
OOOHHHH  Yeah

Girl I'm trying and I don't want to
waste your time 
no longer do I have a one track mind
though i broke your trust babe but 
I loved you too much babe
MMMMMM Listen

Don't keep on pushing me
(if you do)
I just might fall over the 
edge baby
MMMMMMM

sometimes your angers hard for me to grab
I just want baby take my hands
and run my fingers through your hair
Listen 

Don't keep on pushing me
(if you do)
I just might fall over the 
edge baby
OOOOOHHH yeah
(baby please)
Listen

Hush baby don't say a word
never like me had to be first 
I told you before 
I can't take no more 
don't push me 
push me no more
cause of loving you 

I'm fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin
fallin, fallin, fallin out of love
fallin out of love baby

I'm gonna tell you one more time
(say it again)

Some times your angers hard for me to grab
I just want baby take my hands
and run my fingers through your hair
Listen 

Don't keep on pushing me
(if you do)
I just might fall over the 
edge baby
say just might do it 

fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin
fallin, fallin, fallin out of love

fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin
fallin, fallin, fallin out of love

Don't keep on pushing me
(if you do)
I just might fall over the 
edge baby
say just might do it 
(said i just might do it)

fallin, fallin, fallin, fallin
fallin, fallin, fallin out of love---Lyrics submitted by Sheneiqua.
