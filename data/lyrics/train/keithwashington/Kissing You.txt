Thinking of you that's all I seem to do
When you're not here I long to hold you near
Baby this time together we must spare
Holding you close taking time to let you know

Tonight's the night we will share
Turn off the lights come close to me
Tell me I'm all you ever need
Tell me it's not just a dream
And if it is my heart believes
That you are mine, and this is real
(Ooh I'm)

(Kissing you) Loving you all through the night
(Share my love) It will be alright

What's better then a love thats made for two
I cannot count the ways I feel for you
But you should know and starting from today
From this point on, my love is here to stay

Lie close to me, hold on
Lets make our love last all night long
Baby I'm yours, take all of me (Oh_
I'll never try to bring you down
My love will always be around
Yes I'm convinced, you're all I need (Oh)

(Kissing you) Loving you all through the night
(Share my love) Tonight is our night (together) Yeah
(Kissing you) Oh, Loving you all through the night
(Share my love) It will all turn out right

Tonight's the night we will share
Turn off the lights come close to me
Tell me I'm all you ever need (Oh)
Tell me it's not just a dream
And if it is my heart believes
That you are mine, and this is real
This is real (Oh)

(Kissing you) My baby
(Share my love) Oh lady, let me show that
Let me show you that I love you baby (together)
(Kissing you) Yes i do, so do it for me
And I'll do it for you honey
(Share my love) You got me in the mood that I'm in
(Forever) Cant nobody stop me now
(Kissing you) Cant nobody save you now
Cos' you're gonna love me
