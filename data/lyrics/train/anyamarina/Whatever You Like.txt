Stacks on deck, Patrn on ice
We can pop bottles all night
Baby, you can have whatever you like
You can have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex so wet so tight
Gas up the jet for you tonight
Baby, you can go wherever you like
You can go wherever you like

Any time you want to pick up the telephone
You know it ain't nothin' drop a couple stacks on you
You want it? You can get it, my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentleys I swear

I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me, won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke ballast "Be quiet! "

Stacks on deck, Patrn on ice
We can pop bottles all night
Baby, you can have whatever you like
You can have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex so wet so tight
Gas up the jet for you tonight
Baby, you can go wherever you like
Yeah, you can go wherever you like, yeah

Shawty, you the hottest, I love the way you drop it
Brain so good coulda swore you went to college
Hundred can't deposit, vacations in the tropics
'Cause everybody know it ain't trickin' if ya got it
You ain't never ever gotta go in your wallet
Long as I got rubber band banks in my pocket
Five six rides with rims and a body kit
Ya ain't gotta downgrade; you can get what I get

My chick can have what she want
Go in any store, buy any bag she want
I know you ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desires like that

I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me, you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I buy it
Tell them other broke ballast "Be quiet! "

Stacks on deck, Patrn on ice
We can pop bottles all night
Baby, you can have whatever you like
You can have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex so wet so tight
Gas up the jet for you tonight
Baby, you can go wherever you like
Yeah, you can go wherever you like

I'm talkin' big boy rides in big boy ice
Let me put this big boy in your life
Wherever you like
Wherever you like
Wherever you like
You can go wherever you like
Wherever you like
Wherever you like
Wherever you like
You can go wherever you like
Wherever you like---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
