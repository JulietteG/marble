You and I have seen some hard times go by
It's no surprise to see one more
Where's that smile you let me steal
So many times before

Though the world seems darker these days
We've been lucky in so many ways

Chorus:
As long as there's laughter that's shared between us
We can survive any storm like the dreamers we are
Our eyes on the stars
We'll get by I know
If we can remember to keep believing
The doubts will take care of themselves
As long as there's laughter
If we should fall, we're alive after all

You and I have seen our share of blue skies
I promise you they'll come again
Light the fire, come lie with me
We'll forget all the rain

Pack away those tears for today
They're a waste of our time anyway

Repeat Chorus

As long as there's laughter
If we should fall
We're alive after all---Lyrics submitted by Laurie Maitland.
