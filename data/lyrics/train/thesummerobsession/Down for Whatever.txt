I dont care
What we do
Where we go
How we get there
We can drive
We can walk
We can fly
We can sit here

Take your time
(I can do anything I want)
Ill be fine
(I can do anything I want)
Nevermind me
Im alright
(Im down)

Cause tonight
Im down
For whatever
Tonight
Im down
For whatever

Got no flow
Im so broke
Finding change 
Between couches
Up in smoke
All my plans
Got my hands 
In my pockets

Take your time
(I can do anything I want)
Ill be fine
(I can do anything I want)
Nevermind me
Im alright
(Im down)

Cause tonight
Im down
For whatever
Tonight
Im down
For whatever

And all we need is tonight
And I can promise forever
Let the world fade away 
(I can do anything I want)
As we align with the ocean spray
(Im down)

Cause tonight
Im down
For whatever
Tonight
(I can do anything I want)
Im down
For whatever
(I can do anything I want)
Tonight
(I can do anything I want)
Im down
For whatever
(I can do anything I want)
(I can do anything I want)
Tonight
(Im down)
Im down
(Im down)
For whatever
