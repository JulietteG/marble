Hanging over a few lines and still im bored
Swallow pills and chase them down and drink till Im sore
I read a book to stay awake
But all the pages make me wait
For something great

My real friends say
Im waiting for what started long ago
And life is what you make of it
So come on now lets go
But still Im bored lately
Do you feel the same
And being alive drives me crazy
And this worlds insane 
And this worlds insane

I go to a party with an army of mindless fucks
No ones doing anything
No ones interesting so what
I go back home and write a poem
But all the words seem dumb
And I feel numb

My real friends say
Im waiting for what started long ago
And life is what you make of it
So come on now lets go
But still Im bored lately
Do you feel the same
And being alive drives me crazy
And this worlds insane

Come on be straight
Do you really expect me to believe what I cant see
Come on be straight
Do you really think this was
Really think this was meant to be
Come on be straight

My real friends say
Im waiting for what started long ago
And life is what you make of it
So come on now lets go
But still Im bored lately
Do you feel the same
And being alive drives me crazy
And this worlds insane
But still Im bored lately
Do you feel the same
And being alive drives me crazy
And this worlds insane
And this worlds insane---Lyrics submitted by Ally.
