Go!
Lets go go!
Go!
Lets go go!

I need you here, but you're always so far away
I call you up, but you know it's just never the same
Cuz bein' closer to you is my sweet escape
Its all i needed
I need you here, but you're always so far away

(chorus)
This is our night 
The look in you're eyes says we can go all the way
I'm losin' my mind, broken inside
I want you to take my breath away

It's obvious that my heart beats for you(for you)
Just let go(go) tonight
we're so close(go) tonight

I need you here, but you're out there on you're own
Do you still look like the pictures in my telephone?
Hiding out in you're room we can be alone
Laughin' out loud
You need me here, but im always so far away

(chorus)

It's obvious that my heart beats for you(for you)
It's obvious that my heart beats for you(for you)
Just let go(go) tonight
we're so close(go) tonight
Just let go(go) tonight
we're so close(go) tonight

(chorus)2x

It's obvious that my heart beats for you(for you)
It's obvious that my heart beats for you(for you)
Just let go(go) tonight
we're so close(go) tonight
Just let go(go) tonight
we're so close(go) tonight

(chorus)

It's obvious that my heart beats for you(for you)5x---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
