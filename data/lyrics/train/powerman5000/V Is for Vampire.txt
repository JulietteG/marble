nobody loves you when your skin is so pale and your teeth are getting sharper than your black fingernails nobody needs ya when your eyes turn white and the light of day can keep you up all night because

v is for vampire 
b is for blood 
so give me your money ill give you my love

How does it feel when your heart turns black and you're looking at yourself but you ain't looking back. You can't die when you're already dead so forget about forgiveness forget what they said because...

v is for vampire 
b is for blood
so give me your money ill give you my love

The only eyes that you have are red they're filled with the ash of the quick and the dead there's no trick and no surprise you're like the devil in the way that you terrorize 

v is for vampire 
b is for blood 
so give me your money ill give you my love---Lyrics submitted by Jeremy.
