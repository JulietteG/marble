[Now, this is what it's like when worlds collide,
Now, this is what it's like.
Now, this is what it's like when worlds collide,
Now, this is what it's like.] 

What is it, really?
What's goin' on here?
You've got the system for total control.
Now is there anybody out there?
Now watch us suffer, yeah, 'cause we can't go. (clap, clap, clap)
What is it really that is in your head?
What little life that you had just died.
I'm gonna be the one that's takin' over.
Now this is what it's like 
When worlds collide!

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go!
What you gonna do? (baby, baby!)
Are you goin' with me?
'Cause I'm goin' with you.
That's the end of all time!

What is it, really,
That motivates you?
The need to fly?
Or this... fear to stop?
I'll go along, when you realize...
When we get there I say, "9 to 10 drop". (clap, clap, clap)
Now, who's alive and who is the devil?
You can't decide, so I'll be your guide.
And, one by one, they will be hand chosen...
Now this is what it's like
When worlds collide!

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go!
What you gonna do? (baby, baby!)
Are you goin' with me? 
'Cause I'm going with you.
That's the end of all time!

(You... are... a... robot.)

[Now this is what it's like when worlds collide, 
Now this is what it's like. 
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide, 
Now this is what it's like.]

What is it, really?
When they're fallin' over?
Everything that we thought was denied.
I'm gonna be the one that's takin' over.
Now this is what it's like 
When worlds collide!

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go!
What you gonna do? (baby, baby!)
Are you goin' with me?
'Cause I'm going with you.
That's the end of all time!

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go!
What you gonna do? (baby, baby!)
Are you goin' with me?
'Cause I'm going with you
That's the end of all time!

Are you ready?
(Yeah, I'm ready!)
That's the end of all time!
Are you goin'?
Yeah, I'm goin'!
That's the end of all time!---Lyrics submitted by Robert.
