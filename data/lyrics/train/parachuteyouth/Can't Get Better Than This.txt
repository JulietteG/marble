Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this

Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
I said
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this

I don't wanna go away
I watched this happen every day
I'm looking at the bright lights
But still I'm chasing fireflies

We don't know where we are
But we're still dancing on a star
Now we're looking at the bright lights
But I was still chasing fireflies

Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
I said
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this

I don't wanna go away
I watched this happen every day
I'm looking at the bright lights
But still I'm chasing fireflies

We don't know where we are
But we're still dancing on a star
Now we're looking at the bright lights
But I was still chasing fireflies

Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
I said
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Can't get better than this
Can't get better than this---
