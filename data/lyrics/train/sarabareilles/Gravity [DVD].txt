Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long
No matter what I say or do
I still feel you here
'Til the moment I'm gone

You hold me without touch
You keep me without chains
I never wanted anyhting so much
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain

(CHORUS)
Set me free
Leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am and I stand
So tall
Just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're onto me
And all over me

Oh

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile
When I thought that I was strong
But you touch me for a little while
And all my fragile strength is gone

(CHORUS)
Set me free
Leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am
And I stand so tall
Just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're onto me
And all over me

I live here on my knees as I
Try to make you see that you're
Everything I think I need here on the ground
But you're neither friend nor foe though I
Can't seem to let you go
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me
Down
Ooh

You're keeping me down, yeah yeah yeah yeah

You're onto me, onto me and all over

Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long---Lyrics submitted by Jacqueline.
