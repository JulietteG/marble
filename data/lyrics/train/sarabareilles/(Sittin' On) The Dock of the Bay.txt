Sitting in the morning sun
I'll be sitting when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
And I watch 'em roll away again
I'm going sitting on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
sit on the dock of the bay
Wasting time
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
I've got nothin to live for
And nothing's gonna come my way
I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
sit on the dock of the bay
Wasting time
Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same
Sittin here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home
So I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Wasting time
uh ~~ uh ~~
uh ~~ uh ~~
I'm gonna sit ion the dick of the bay
Wasting Time, Wasting Time, Wasting Time---Lyrics submitted by Shawn.
