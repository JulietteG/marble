There's a harvest each Saturday night
At the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride
A place you can stand for one night and get gone

And it's clear, this conversation ain't doing a thing
'Cause these boys only listen to me when I sing
And I don't feel like singing tonight all the same songs

Here in these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
There's nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?

The situation's always the same
You got your wolves in their clothes
Whispering Hollywood's name
Stealing gold from the silver they see
But it's not me

Here in these deep city lights
Girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
There's nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold you?

Calling out, somebody save me
I feel like I'm fading away, am I gone?
Calling out, somebody save me
I feel like I'm fading

No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no

Deep city lights, girl could get lost tonight
I'm finding every reason to be gone
And there's nothing here to hold on to
Could I hold on to you?---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlin.
