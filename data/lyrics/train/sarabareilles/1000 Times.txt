Back of the room, Looking at you,
Counting the steps, between us.
Hundred and five, little blades in a line,
From your skin to mine, and I feel it.
Eyes on the ground, But I can't look up now,
Don't wanna give it away, My Secret.

In another life, my teeth and tongue,
Will speak aloud what until now I've only sung.

Cuz I would die, to make you mine, bleed me dry, each and every time. 
I don't mind, no I don't mind it, I would come back a 1000 times. 
You could make me wait, forever, push me away and tell me never.
I don't mind, no I don't  mind it, I would come back a 1000 times.
Eh eh ehh, hey ey ey.

Kiss me goodnight, like a good friend might.  
Ill do the same, but mean it. 
Cuz love is a cage, these words on a page.
Carry the pain, that don't free it.

In another life, I wouldn't need to,
Tell myself at times i'm to release you.

Cuz I would die, to make you mine, bleed me dry, each and every time. 
I don't mind, no I don't mind it, I would come back a 1000 times. 
You could make me wait, forever, push me away and tell me never.
I don't mind, no I don't mind it, I would come back a 1000 times.

Again again, i'll let it go, let it go, cover my mouth don't let a single word slip out. Wouldn't wanna tell you no, tell you no, nothing could be worse than the risk of losing what I don't have now. We could buy the minute though is it so bad, if I wanna cry out.

I would die, to make you mine, bleed me dry, almost every time. 
But I don't mind, oh I don't mind it, I will come back a 1000 times. 
Make me wait, forever, push me away, tell me never.
I don't mind, no I don't  mind it, I will come back a 1000 times.

I would come back a 1000 times.. yea, yea
I would come back a 1000 times.---Lyrics submitted by Efrain Jimenez.
