So far away
There lies a place that can't touch
I hide the pain
But it's still not enough
Time after time I keep running in circles
I can't deny what is real

[Chorus]:
You're the one
You are the hurt inside of me
You are the one who makes me weak
Shadows that crawl all over me
Swallow the light that lets me see
Have I fallen too far away ?
I keep rnning away
I'm still pushing away
Have I fallen too far ?
Now that its over its hard to stay sober
You're the one.

I lie awake
Inside the darkness I fall apart
I can't escape
From your hold of my heart
Time after time I keep runnig in circles
I can't deny what is real

[Chorus]

Running in circles
Still finding my way
I can live for tomorrow
And not yesteday
I can't deny what is real

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Dominique DuPre.
