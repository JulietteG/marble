I'll Light the sun and the darkness Will turn into light. 
Now I see the world for the first time.

If I don't break all the lies that I make I'll leave them for you
If I could hear your voice on the phone its better than being alone

Chorus

Butterfly flies and a bird doesn't swim
you told me again and again
but If I don't do all the thing that you do
it doesn't mean there's no where to begin.

Chorus.

I'll Take all the gold I thought was mine
and I'd trade it for a minute of time
So I keep waiting and waiting and waiting

Chorus

For the first time with you....---Lyrics submitted by Polly.
