Hello, my love
I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze
The sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls runnin' through my mind

In the garden, I see
West purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins
Dressed in green

Pretty music I hear
So happy and loud
Blue flowers echo
From a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask, "is it cool"
"Is it cool"

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays I sit in for a few

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)

(Ah, ah, ah, ah, aaaaaaah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, aaaaaaah)

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22

I sit in for a few

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)......---
