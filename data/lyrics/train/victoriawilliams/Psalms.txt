Although the Lord be high above
He doth recall the lowly
And deep within thy secret heart
The Lord shall surely know thee

Although I walk in trouble Lord
I know thou wilt revive me
You hold me in thy very hands
And always walk beside me

I'll love thee with mine own true heart
Before the world I'll praise thee
Your love was there before the start
Thy mercy doth amaze me

If I ascend to Heaven Lord
I know thou wilt be with me
And if I make my bed in hell
I know thou wont desert me

How precious are thy thoughts to me
How great thy loving kindness
How blind the man who cannot see
That God will ease his blindness
