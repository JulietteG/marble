We are the sure fire (winners winners winners)

We're coming up like killin' machines
Our big guns gonna shatter your scene
It's pandemonium on the floor
'Cause everybody wants a little more

They wanna ride on our rocket ship
Right 'round the moon for a velvet kiss
'Cause all the girls and the boys wanna know
How far this bad wild child's gonna go

(Chorus)
We are the sure fire winners
Uh oh, yeah big time hitters
We are the sure fire winners
Uh oh, yeah big time hitters
Bringin' the heat and the word is out
Giving you something to shout about
We are, yeah, we are
We are the sure fire winners

Flip the switch and the missile will fire
I'm a heatseeker and I'm full of desire
You're all drawn to the heat of the flame
'Cause you wanna be a star in our hall of fame

I was born with glitter on my face
My baby clothes were made of leather and lace
And all the girls in the club wanna know
Where did all their pretty boys go

(Chorus)

Take a walk on the wild with me
Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe
Never gonna stop 'till we reach the top
Never gonna stop 'till we reach the top

You better get out of the game
It's never gonna be the same
Move over cause the new boy's calling your name

(Chorusx2)

Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe, yeah
Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe
Gonna take you to the top to the brink of what you believe---Lyrics submitted by Sidney.
