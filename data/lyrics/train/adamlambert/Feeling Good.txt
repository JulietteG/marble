Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom in the tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when the day is done,
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me

Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Oh scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
oh for me, for me and I'm feelin, I'm feelin good..
I'm feelin..good.....

And I'm feeling good---Lyrics submitted by Jrene.
