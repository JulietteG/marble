Friends say im fine
Friends say its good
Everybody says its just like Robin Hood

Well i move like a rat
I talk like a cat
I sting like a bee
Babe, i wanna be your man

Well it's plain to see
You were meant for me, yeah
I'm your toy
Your 20 century boy

Friends say im fine
Friends say its good
Everybody says its just like Robin hood

Well i move like cat
I talk like a rat
I sting like a bee
Babe, wanna be your man

Well it's plain to see
You were meant for me, yeah
I'm your toy
Your 20 century boy

20 century boy
I wanna be your toy
20 century boy
I wanna be your toy

Friends say im fine
Friends say its good
Everybody says its just like Robin hood!

Well i move like cat 
I talk like a rat
I sting like a bee
Babe, i wanna be your man

Well its plain to see
You were meant for me, yeah
im your toy 
Your 20 century boy

20 century boy
I wanna be your toy
20 century boy
I wanna be your toy---Lyrics submitted by Cassie.
