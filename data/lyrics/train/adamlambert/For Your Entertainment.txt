So hot out the box can we pick up the pace?
Turn it up, heat it up I need to be entertained
Push the limit, are you with it?
Baby, dont be afraid
Im a hurt ya real good, baby

Lets go its my show
Baby, do what I say
Dont trip off the glitz
That Im gonna display
I told ya Ima hold ya
Down until youre amazed
Give it to you til your screaming my name

No escaping when I start
Once Im in I own your heart
Theres no way youll ring the alarm
So hold on until its over

Oooh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what Im about to do?
Cause its about to get rough for you
Im here for your entertainment
Oooh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
Ya thought an angel swept ya off ya feet
Well Im about to turn up the heat
Im here for your entertainment

Its alright youll be fine baby, Im in control
Take the pain take the pleasure
Im the master of both
Close your eyes not your mind
Let me into your soul
Ima work ya til your totally blown

No escaping when I start
Once Im in I own your heart
Theres no way you'll ring the alarm
So hold on until its over

Oooh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what Im bout to do?
Cause its about to get rough for you
Im here for your entertainment
Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept ya off your feet
Well Im about to turn up the heat
Im here for your entertainment

For your Entertainment
Im here for your entertainment
Do you like what you see?
Let me entertain ya till you scream

oooh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what Im bout to do?
Cause its about to get rough for you
Im here for your entertainment
Oooh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You thought an angel swept ya off your feet
Well Im about to turn up the heat
Im here for your entertainment---Lyrics submitted by Ariel.
