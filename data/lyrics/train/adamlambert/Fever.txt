There he goes
My baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe
Yeah I know we both know
It isn't time, no
But could you be m-mine?

We'll never get too far
Just you, me and the bar
Silly mnage   trois, sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?

Oh baby, light's on
But you're mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone, hey
With this fever, fever, yeah
My one and own
I wanna get you alone
Give you fever, fever, yeah

There it goes
You're still my so and so
'Cause, sweetheart
No-no-nobody a-kno-kno-knows me
Or can find
Time to be m-mine, mine

Let's get inside your car
Just you, me and the stars
Kind of mnage   trois, sometimes
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?

Oh baby, light's on
But you're mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone, hey
With this fever, fever, yeah
My one and own
I wanna get you alone
Give you fever, fever, yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

You burn me, burn me up
Baby yea, yea

baby you're mine
Baby you're mine,
mine,
you're mine

Oh baby, light's on
But you're mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
My one and own
I wanna get you alone
I got this fever that I can't sweat out

Oh baby light's on
But you're mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
My one and own
I wanna get you alone
Yeah give you fever, fever yeah

Give you my f-f-fever my f-fever
Give you my f-f-fever my f-fever
Give you fever, fever, yeah
Give you fever, fever, yeah---Lyrics submitted by kimmy.
