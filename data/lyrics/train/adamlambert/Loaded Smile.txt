If I say I'm sorry
It's just me telling a lie
Mhmmmmmmmmmm
When you're in my arms 
I feel emptier inside
I never felt so satisfied

Everything falls into place
But I think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed
But honestly I don't know if we'll survive

A loaded smile 
An empty glass
And one last dance

Walking hand in hand
You are all I ever want
And when you're not around
yeah don't even notice that you're gone
We are barely hanging on

Everything falls into place
But I think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed
But honestly I don't know if we'll survive

Makes me want you baby
Can't you feel it, can't you feel it, can't you feel it?
I do still want to baby 
It's a certain kind of complicated
(X2)

Everything falls into place
But I think I need a little more time
And yeah I know my life has changed
But honestly I don't know if we'll survive

A loaded smile
An empty glass
And one last dance---Lyrics submitted by Izzy.
