There's a spark of magic in your eyes
Candyland appears each time you smile
Never thought that fairy tales came true
But they come true when I'm near you

You're a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise and...

CHORUS:
Betcha by golly wow (wow) (wow)
You're the one that I've been waiting for... forever
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

If I could, I'd catch a falling star
To shine on you so I know where you are
Paint a rainbow in your favorite shade
To show I love you, thinking of you

Write your name across the sky
Anything you ask, I'll try cuz...

CHORUS:
Betcha by golly wow (wow) (wow)
You're the one that I've been waiting for... forever
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

Betcha by golly!
You're the one, yes you are! (Don't you let 'em tell you otherwise)
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong!

Baby, sometime
A man can't find words to express all the things he feels inside
But every just so often
The words of another who's truly in love seem to work out fine

To say I love you (I love you)
To say I'm thinking of you!

CHORUS:
Betcha by golly wow (wow) (wow)
You're the one that I've been waiting for... forever
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

You're the one I'm thinking of, thinkin' of
Ever will my...
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

I love you, baby ---Lyrics submitted by Lalaahr.
