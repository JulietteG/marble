Yukato may de sanche tu
Chanke who dey tempe poe yo ya he who
Me tumbe bordo ya y whoo
Chala oh ay ee ya ka aye dana kona koya he eykay
Geto ca con a he geto ca con a heyyyayyyyeee

I thought I caught you staring from across the room
Come over to meeee make the first move
Make me believe it's all for me
This is the world protecting me
As for tonight I'll hold your hand
Forget about your lady
Forget my mannn

Chala oh ay ee ya ka aye dana kona koya he eykay
Geto ca con a he geto ca con a heyyyayyyyeee

Chanke who dey tempe poe yo ya he who
Me tumbe bordo ya y whoo
Chala oh ay ee ya ka aye dana kona koya he eykay
