Woah, woah, woah, woah...

This time, I'm serious, this time...
This time, I'm serious
This time it's serious
It's as bad as it looks
This hurts just like it should

The perfect place and the perfect time
Where I was yours and baby you were mine
You don't give me something to believe in
But I'm not believing

Just run, you've won, I'm broken, it's done
Is this, is this your idea of fun?
When dealing with the pro in breaking hearts
Just run, just run.

Woah... (Run away, run away now!)
Woah... (To the games that you played, oh!)
Woah... (Run away, run away now!)
Woah...

Does anybody else feel this way?
Does everybody else hurt the same?

I just have to go!
Run away from this town!
Change my name off the grave from your burial ground!
I just want you to know I have to let you go!

Just run, you've won, I'm broken, it's done
Is this, is this your idea of fun?
When dealing with the pro in breaking hearts
Just run, just run.

We were golden, but now we're broken
You're the artist of our destruction
We were golden, but now we're broken
You're the artist of our destruction

We were golden, but now we're broken
(Before you start to run from me, before you actually can see)
You're the artist of our destruction
(With your hands around my neck, I don't have a heart worth breaking!)

I'll run, you've won, I'm broken, it's done
Is this, is this your idea of...

Just run, you've won, I'm broken, it's done
Is this, is this your idea of fun?
When dealing with the pro in breaking hearts
Just run, just run.

Just run, you've won, I'm broken, it's done
Is this, is this your idea of fun?
When dealing with the pro in breaking hearts
Just run, just run.---
