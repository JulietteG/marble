You dont, you dont notice that Im here
You dont, you dont seem to care that you play with my heart,
Take me for granted, leave me in the dark, no no

And Im not, and Im not, even thinking clear
Today I smile, next day full of tears
Losing my mind, I dont even know
If youre wasting my time, no no

Are you gonna crush my heart, cover me
Cut me off, make your decision, boy
Crush my heart, cover me
Cut me off, make your decision

Rock, paper, scissors
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
I dont know what youre feeling
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
Yeah yeah

Wish I, wish I, had the common sense
To know better and just walk away
Easier said, harder to do when I still think theres hope
For me and you
Always hurts to never be put first
If Im last on your list, really whats the worth?
Keep me in fear asking you questions I dont wanna hear the answers to

Are you gonna crush my heart, cover me
Cut me off, make your decision, boy
Crush my heart, cover me
Cut me off, make your decision

Rock, paper, scissors
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
I dont know what youre feeling
Will it be rock, paper, scissors

Someone should have told me I cant compete
With someone who is impossible to beat (I just dont get it)
Makes my heart beat but is killing me,
Are the odds in my favor, dont know

Rock, paper, scissors
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
I dont know what youre feeling
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Rock, paper, scissors
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
I dont know what youre feeling
Will it be rock, paper, scissors
Yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Courtney.
