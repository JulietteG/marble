If I was a million miles away
Could you promise 
That our love would be safe
Oh
And if a beautiful girl was in your face
Would you remember
Even remember my name
I need to know right where you stand (Ohhh)
Cuz I'd give up everything I have
And baby for your love
If that's what it takes to last
Oh

I swear for you boy I'd go to extremes
Cuz our love is priceless
Our love is priceless (Woah-woah-woah)
Take my car, take my home, take everything
Cuz our love is priceless
Our love is priceless 

(Woah-woah-woah, oh oh 4x)
Woah-woah-woah

If there's ever hurt inside your heart
You'd better believe that
You could run right into these arms 
Oh
Nowhere could ever be too far
For me to come get ya
Cuz nothing can keep us apart
I need to know that you feel the same (Oh)
Cuz I'd sacrifice all that I've got today
And baby for your love
I'm down to go all the way

I swear for you boy I'd go to extremes
Cuz our love is priceless
Our love is priceless (Woah-woah-woah)
Take my car, take my home, take everything
Cuz our love is priceless 
Our love is priceless 

(Woah-woah-woah, oh oh) 4x
ohh-ohh-ohh-woah

To the edge of the earth I'd go to
Save you, that's what your girl supposed to do
But I need to know that
(You'd do the same if the tables were reversed, baby)
Yeah, aint nothing I'd give up in this world for my (man)
Ain't no use in tryna fight this
Cuz this here love is priceless

I swear for you boy I'd go to extremes (to extremes)
Cuz our love is priceless
Our love is priceless (Woah-woah-woah)
Take my car, take my home, take everything
Cuz our love is priceless 
Our love is priceless 

Woahhhh ohhhhh
ohhhh
ohh-ohh-ohhh-woah

I swear for you boy I'd go to extremes (to extremes)
Cuz our love is priceless 
Our love is priceless (Woah-woah-woah)
Take my car, take my home, take everything
Cuz our love is priceless 
Our love is priceless---Lyrics submitted by charlayne.
