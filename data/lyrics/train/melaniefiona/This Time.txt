[Verse 1: Melanie Fiona]

 If only you knew all the love I had inside
 If only I told you
 That you were my greatest pride
 If only I showed you just how good you made me feel
 Maybe I wouldnt be alone and you would be right here but
 I dont wanna do it over
 The first time has gone away
 You cant rewrite the past
 All I can do is say

[Hook]
 This time, Ill do it much better
 Love you like I never
 Ever loved you before
 Oh baby, now this time
 I'll give you my heart and soul
 And every drop of my love
 If you say yes Ill give you my best
 This time

[Verse 2: Melanie Fiona]
 This time, Im gonna be stronger
 This time Ill do it all the way
 This time Ill be a better woman
 This time I wont get in my own way
 I could go back you never would have gone
 If I knew then what I know now
 Ive told you all that I feel for you in my heart
 In my head I know what I shouldve said
 I know what I shoulda did
 But I dont wanna do it over
 The first time is gone away
 You cant rewrite the past
 All I can do is say

[Hook]

[J. Cole]
 If looks kill then Melanie you a felony
 We both hot I guess we couldnt take the jealousy
 All in my ear I had my homeboys telling me
 How to be a player, we fell off like Bill Bellamy
 MTV shhh, we used to watch Law and Order, NBC shh
 But now Im watching solo on some empty seat shit
 Thinking of you, I got a lot more drinking to do
 Reminiscing, though I seen it coming
 Yeah I had a premonition
 Right beside each other and somehow it felt distant
 Lets rewind back when days sunny like Liston
 Smile just glisten, your booty like a cushion
 Is this the moment where we making up
 And realise we tripping forever breaking up
 And then I break you off, put you to sleep know its deep
 When the girl of his dreams is the same one to wake him up
