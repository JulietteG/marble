Pour me another drink.
Just need some time.
A little while, a little while on my own

Another empty evenin', another empty glass.
A chance I took, a dirty look, another glass.

When I was young, the world revolved around me
I was strong and free
But days grew long, and washed away the beauty
Now look at me.

I remember happiness
I remember rain
I remember her dress
But I forget her name

My days are few
But my regrets are many, nothing left to hold on to
I do my best to drink away the memories
But all I see is you.

When I was young, the world revolved around me. I was strong and free
But days grew long, and washed away the beauty. 
Now look at me
Now look at me 

So pour me another drink.---Lyrics submitted by Layla.
