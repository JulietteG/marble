Every morning when I woke up
I was stoked up
I was leaving without a purpose
Always jumping all the hurdles
Doing circles
In the dark with a broken compass

I can't explain the way it feels
I could trip on my own words
I make mistakes, that much is clear
But I made it here my love
Yeah I made it here my love

You're the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah it's a fickle world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right

One thing I got right
One thing I got right

Every morning when you wake up
I wanna hold you
I just need to be wrapped around you
It's kinda funny when you think that
You just got here
Now I know I can't live without you

I can't explain the way it feels
I could show the million words
Sometimes it seems like it ain't real
But you're really here my love
Yeah, you're really here my love

You're the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah it's a fickle world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right

Everytime I see your smile
Everytime I hear your laugh
Baby you bring in new sunshine over house
You are the little dream
And since I was a child
My fairytale comes true when I look at you
May not be here forever
But it'll be a long road together
I already know
We're gonna be fine, fine, fine
We're gonna be just fine, fine, fine

You're the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah it's a fickle world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I would hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right
You're the one thing that I got right

And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right
You're the one thing that I got right

One thing that I got right
One thing that I got right ---
