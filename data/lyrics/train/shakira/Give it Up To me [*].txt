How you doin I'm Mr Mos I'm back 
Timb are you on it 
Timb are you on it 
Give me some 
Is this what you wanted? 
Is this what you wanted? 
Oh 

Uh Wayne's World 
I'm the cashier I change girls 
You can go up my crain girl 
And Imma go down that drain girl 
Hey ah midnight cowboy 
My flow's a dog...down boy 
Hah my girl is a queen 
And she do what I say and I say what I mean 
Then I give it to her uncut 
Shakira, swing those hips like nun chucks 
Now, give it to me 
I want the best and the best things in life are free 

CHORUS 
You can have it all 
Anything you want you can make it yours 
Anything you want in the world 
Anything you want in the world 
Give it up to me 

Nothing too big or small 
Anything you want you can make it yours 
Anything you want in the world 
Anything you want in the world 
Give it up to me 

What you get is exactly what you give 
Never really know until you try 
We're so ahead of this 
Got this she wolf appetite that keeps me up all night 
You know the way it works don't be afraid to ask 
Aim high when the target is low 
FYI I am ready to go 
People say men are just like kids 
Never saw a kid behave like this 

What you give is exactly what you receive 
So put me in a cage and lock me away and i'll play the games that you want me to play 

CHORUS 
You can have it all 
Anything you want you can make it yours 
Anything you want in the world 
Anything you want in the world 
Give it up to me 

Nothing too big or small 
Anything you want you can make it yours 
Anything you want in the world 
Anything you want in the world 
Give it up to me 

Hey can we go by walking 
Or do you prefer to fly 
All of the roads are open 
In your mind 
In your life 
Give it up to me 

Hey can we go by walking 
Or do you prefer to fly 
All of the roads are open 
In your life 
In your life 
Give it up to me 

Hey lil lady 
What's your plan 
Say lil mama 
Come take a ride jump in 

Hey there baby 
What's on your mind 
Don't need approval tonight, tonight 
Give it up 

CHORUS 
You can have it all 
Anything you want you can make it yours 
Anything you want in the world 
Anything you want in the world 
Give it up to me 

Nothing too big or small 
Anything you want you can make it yours 
Anything you want in the world 
Anything you want in the world 
Give it up to me 

You can have it all 
Anything you want you can make it yours 
Anything you want in the world 
Anything you want in the world 
Give it up to me 

Nothing too big or small 
Anything you want you can make it yours 
Anything you want in the world 
Anything you want in the world 
Give it up to me---Lyrics submitted by samantha.
