I hear your voice, its like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think Im falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name its like a little prayer
Im down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know Ill take you there

Like a child, you whisper softly to me
Youre in control, just like a child
Now Im dancing

When you call my name its like a little prayer
Im down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know Ill take you there

Just like a prayer, Ill take you there
Ill take you there, Ill take you there
Its like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, Ill take you there
Ill take you there, Ill take you there
Just like a dream to me
Just like a prayer
Just like a dream to me
Just like a prayer
Just like a dream to me

When you call my name its like a little prayer
Im down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know Ill take you there---
