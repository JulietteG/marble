Show me your tears
Show me your scars
Show me your flesh wounds
Show me your heart

Show me your death bed
Your death bed
So that I may rest in peace

Show me your fangs
Show me your claws
Break all my bones
Break all my loss

Show me your darkest heart
Your darkest heart
So that I may rest in peace

Eat my arms
And eat my legs
Eat the flesh inbetween my ribs
Eat my face
Eat my hair follicles
Eat my brain

So that I may
So that I may
So that I may rest in peace.---Lyrics submitted by Mason.
