No more tears
No more crying
No more sighing, lying or dying

No more HIV
No more tweaking
No more drugs or immune systems being weakened

Just happy times and half assed rhymes and mimes
Because mimes are dears
But most of all, I want no more tears

No more bad times
No more bummers
No more SUVs and no more Hummers

No more racism
No more discrimination
No more fat dumb fucks keeping people out of our nation

We're all one big band across this land and we should sing in tune
Let us grow the balls to break the walls
We've got to do it soon

But most of all, I want no more tears
No more crying
No more sighing, lying, or dying.---Lyrics submitted by Mason.
