I wish I had more money than I have
And I know that that's not punk
But I'd like to pay my rent
And I can't survive without money
I can't survive without money

And I want to eat rare red meat
I want to feel it digesting
Inside of my tummy
I support animal testing
I'd kill a kitten
To save a human being

The human race
They are big big dicks
We fuck holes in the world
And fuck everybody else
And we fuck, because we are lonely
We fuck, because we are lonely

And we oughtta give it
One more shot
We have to save the world
And bathe ourselves with love
Because love is all we need
Except love, isn't all we need

We need compasion
And we need empathy
And we need love, a little bit
And we need some money
Or a way to fulfill our 5 basic needs
That we all have
We all have---Lyrics submitted by Mason.
