No one knew I was Johnnie Ray
At the dead celebrity party
And I even had a fake hearing aid
But still no one paid any attention to me

Isn't it such a cry for help
Pretending to be someone besides yourself?
But it ain't stopping anybody at this stupid party
Till the last bottle of liquor is off the shelf

There's a Mexican Orson Welles
And hey, there's one of the Golden Girls
Anton LaVey talking to Frida Kahlo
Insufferable purgatory world

Oh my stars! What an array!
A parade of thinly veiled self-pity
Living so vicariously
But with no guts to seal the deal already

Nobody danced. Nobody could not stop not dancing

So I waltzed through the stupidity
Looking for brains like a hungry zombie
I saw a girl in her street clothes
Not some ball gown covered in blood
And then I told her, "Don't ever change. I want to dance with you."
And then we danced...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
