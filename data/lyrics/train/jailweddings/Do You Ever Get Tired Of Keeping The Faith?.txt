Can you see all those dumb angels, flying away from me?
Leaving all those handsome Devils, crying next to me?
Say, let me ask you, baby
As the whole world's sleeping
And we are both wide awake
Do you ever get tired of keeping the faith?

Your God is gone
He has left you on your knees
I pull you up and hold you close
But you're still genuflecting
I know what's wrong
And I know insanity
Expecting different results
By doing the same damn thing

And I know I am not weak
But goddamn, this fatigue
Feels like every bone is gonna break
Do you ever get tired of keeping the faith?

I know you can't see the world pass you by
When you're stuck in a hurricane's eye
So we much channel the power of every natural disaster
You can't just say you are just "soul searching"
The more we pray, the more our hands are not working
And all the while, the world will pass us by
Even faster

Can you see me on the tower with my artillery?
Picking off those phony rebels, to infinity
Say, let me ask you, baby
As the dawn is creeping
And we're both still wide awake
Do you ever get tired of keeping the faith?---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
