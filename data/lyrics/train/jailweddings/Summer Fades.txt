Have you noticed that
The older you get
Summer fades
Who'll be the first to admit
How cold we all look wearing shades?
Was every hole we dug in the sand
A secret demand for a shallow grave
I guess I've become a man
The older I get
Summer fades

There's clouds in our mind
Now the sun can't break through the haze
Other seasons were unkind
Now we can't tell apart the days
It's not a crime to still love
The one that somehow got away
But just remember what I say
The older you get
Summer fades

We used to walk along the beach
Cause we couldn't get any further
Did you get burned from the heat
Complete with a nostalgic shiver?
OH! The crippling ignorant bliss of innocence!!!

What a waste of time we spent wondering
"What ever happened to those good old days?"
The gutter empties into the ocean
And the older you get
Summer fades---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
