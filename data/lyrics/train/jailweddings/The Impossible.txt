The Impossible (Hart)

I thought that I knew torture 'till
It made a wishbone of my will
It was so sly and slow burning
Oh my God, what is happening?

That dizzy familiar feeling
I thought I'd never feel again
And she's standing right beside me
But I'm not supposed to do anything

Where her bad reputation lies
I saw a softness in her eyes
I know it's a sight she's saved just for me
Those times we snuck off into the night

And now my heart's so full
And I'm trying to deny it all
But it started with her in the hospital
When I just couldn't do anything

It's so impossible
Now not to want this girl
The stupidest thing in the world
When two lovers can't show their true feelings---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
