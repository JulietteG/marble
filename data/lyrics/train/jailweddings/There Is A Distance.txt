There is a distance
In our lives
I'm not talking about
That space between
Our fetal alcohol-syndrome eyes
It's not the geography
Or the cruelty of time
It's our will to connect
Stillborn yet benign
It's not the radiation
That makes our hair fall out
It's that deeper question 
We just won't talk about
It's the strange resistance
To our mutual magnetic clout
There is a distance...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
