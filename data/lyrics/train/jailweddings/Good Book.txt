She was a good book
The best I ever read
Such a good book
Didn't want it to end

I'd curl up with her at night, after I took my medicine
But I cannot explain that important page that was missin'

That non-fiction mystery
Turned true-crime autobiography
That threatened to end
Over and over again
She was a good book
But I would have preferred
Her to stay open

I took such a good look
She was touching my face
Blurring into a place
Where the words were erased

It doesn't matter, that I think about her as something inanimate
Because I just can't stop wondering what that final line meant

Like I know a good song
Makes me feel like I'm in love
Mixed with the feeling that something bad's about to happen
She was a good book
I took her by the spine
And dove right in

We kept the door locked, and we kept the binds shut so nobody could peek in
I held her so tight, she cried, that her spine was starting to weaken

Now I feel like that fool
That dropped his tray of food at school
The five second rule in a five year plan
She was a good book
One that I 
Stole from a friend---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
