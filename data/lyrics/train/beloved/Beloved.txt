This is a loose translation - but will give you some idea of what is being sung. It is a love song from a woman to the Hindu God Krishna who is known as Shyam (the Dark One). "Re" in this context means "O":

Daras dikhe jaa, Shyam Re
Show me a glimpse of yourself, O Dark One

Daras dikha jaa, Shyam Re
Saawre, saawre
Show me a glimpse of yourself, O Dark One
(Saawre means the same as Shyam)

Chavvi torey nainon ki, taan teri bansi ki
Chavvi torey nainon ki, taan teri bansi ki
The reflection of your eyes and the tune of your flute
The reflection of your eyes and the tune of your flute

Satoan na tum aisay piya, Main hu teri bas teri
Do not torture me like this O loved one.  I am yours, only yours

Saason mein basa tera naam re
Shyam re, saawre
Your name resides in my breath
O Dark One, O Dark One

Itt ud khoju piya
Searching for you here and there O loved one

Jaadu tuney aisa kiya
You have done such magic on me

Samjhi ab lila tori
Now I understand what you are doing

Basey morey man mein piya
You reside in my heart, O loved one
