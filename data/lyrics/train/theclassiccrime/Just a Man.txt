Dripping wet with practiced sincerity,
cute slogans for the intangible mysteries
You reduce your god (pruned to profit your ego)
to a TV commercial,
"But what I sell! (advertise!)" you scream,
"Purchase my lifestyle!"

I once held the key but now I have nothing
You are so naive,
I'm sorry for leading you along
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man

Wake me up and wipe the cliche's from my eyes,
It's killing me when all I see is hypocrisy and lies
I know that my faults bring me down, it's a constant battle
I'm not your saint, I'm not your savior

I once held the key to everything you ever dreamed of
Now I have nothing,
You are so naive
I'm sorry for leading you along
I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
