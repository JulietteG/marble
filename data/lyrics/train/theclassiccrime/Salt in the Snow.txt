Give me wings give me peace these are the things that i need. tormented broken and shamed. are you listening (are you listening) give me shelter from the storm i know its alot to ask for considering how resent i vow the der on your mane are you listening (are you listening) i have heard that winters cold will give way to summers warmth oh! no! like salt in the snow i'm melted and left  all alone on the side of the road is this where i am for your sake stuck between asleep and awake my mind is dreaming of things are you listening (are you listening) i took you for granted again and threw you a sigh and pretended for 1 minute i had control of my life and direction it seemed to be in i was wrong again (i was wrong again) are you listening i have heard winters cold will give way to summers warmth oh! no! like salt in the snow im melted and left all alone on the side of the road and i will wait for you to come to again and i cant pretend like i'm confident and i cant pretend like it makes much since when it doesn't i have heard that winters cold will give way to summers warmth oh!no! like salt in the snow i'm melted and left all alone on the side of the road (on the side of the road) i heard that winters cold will give way to summers warmth oh!no! like salt in the snow i'm melted and left all alone on the side of the road i heard that winters cold will give way to summers warmth oh! no! i'm melted and left all alone on the side of the road.---Lyrics submitted by shay.
