We sing the same song, you and I
With lead feet in deep water, we cry out to live or die
Instead we tread in waves to stay alive
Our heads above the grave but there's no one to save us this time

So I will sing and you will hear me
And join the chorus so we can start again, oh
Our voices raised are flawed but freeing
Our souls so we can change and start again, oh

My life's a painting I've done blind
With each brush stroke you'll watch me blur every solid line
Over this canvas I have stood with no one left beside me
No one to decide if it's good

So I will sing and you will hear me
And join the chorus so we can start again, oh
Our voices raised are flawed but freeing
Our souls so we can change and start again
Again, again, again, again, again, yeah

I will sing and you will hear me
And join the chorus so we can start again, oh
Our voices raised are flawed but freeing
Our souls so we can change and start again
Again, again, again, again, again, again---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
