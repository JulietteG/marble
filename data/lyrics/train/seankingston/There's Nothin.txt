There's nothi'n in this world
There's not another girl that could satisfy my needs
There's nothi'n in this world
Theres not another boy that could make me feel so sweet
Cos' my love lifes so right when she hold me so tight
How she kiss me goodnight
Cos' he fills up my life
Like a star he shines bright
Boy, come with me now
The first night me meet her
Yes me senorita never want to leave her no
Because the gal look so sweet and compure & sweet
And me really want to take her home
Cos' she look so nice and she is one of a kind
When me look up in her eyes then she got mesmerized
Picture Perfect like a Kodak moment
When she kiss me goodnight and she feelin up on me
And we be there from the jump,never front,never stunt
Never done what an average girl done
And I can tell by her body language
She can feel my emotions
And she got me anxious
So that's me type
Me and me angel
And me really have to let her know
She's the women of my life
Oh yes she so right
So please let the chorus go
There's nothn in this world
There's not another girl that could satisfy my needs
There' nothn in this world
There' not another boy that could me feel o sweet
Cos' me love lifes so right
When she hold me so tight 
How she kiss me goodnight
Cos' he fills up my life
Boy, come with me now

I saw you from across the room
Looking so fly
I gotta talk to you yeah,
It didnt take a sec to see
Your the only one who wanna rescue me
I cant lie
Boy your my type of guy
And there's nothin in this world that can stop me from loving you
Girl you put me in a good mood
And me love the way you flex too
We could chill girl, after school
Cos' I aint trippin girl its up to you
And since then we've been inseperable 
Cos' I did everything to get next to you
Since day 1 you know I stay true
So ever since then its been me & my boo
Theres nothin in this world
Theres not another girl that could satisfy my needs
Theres nothin in this world
Theres not another boy could make me feel o sweet
Cos' me love lifes so right
When she hold me so tight
How she kiss me goodnight
Cos' he fills my life
Like a star he shines bright
Boy, come with me now

There's nothin' in this world, there's nothin' in this world
There's nothn, there's nothin

There's nothin in this world, there's nothin in this world
There's nothin, there's nothin---Lyrics submitted by Keana.
