It took so long to get here
Why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna go
It took so long to get here
Why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna go

It took so long for you
To get close to me
Now you wanna go run away girl
Away from me
I know it's got to be hard
Cuz I'm so busy
Not to mention many lonely nights
Just missin' me

Cuz ain't nothing better than you by my side (my side) x4

It took so long to get here
Why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna go
It took so long to get here
Why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna go

It took some time to
Learn to earn her trust (learn to earn her trust)
I ain't goin nowhere anytime
So you can put that on us
Pucci, Louis, Rodeo, we gon' live it up
Now you want to say goodbye
And go and mess it all up

Cuz ain't nothing better than you by my side (my side) x4

It took so long to get here
Why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna go
It took so long to get here
Why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna go

Forgive me x3

I love you x3

My mom say
My pop say
My family say

They love you x3

It took so long to get here
Why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna go
It took so long to get here
Why you wanna go (tell me girl)
Why you wanna leave me
Why you wanna go---Lyrics submitted by Randy.
