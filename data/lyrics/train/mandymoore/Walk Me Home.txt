Walk me home
I don't want to go all the way alone
Baby won't you take my hand
Come with me now to a special land 
Baby won't you walk with me home

3 A.M.
You're on my mind once again
I must have been dreaming 
Thought I felt your heartbeat just then
And I wonder how it would be if 
I was lady 
And you were my friend

I would put my heart in your hand and it would never end

(Chorus)
Baby won't you walk me home (walk me home)
i don't want to go all the way alone (all alone)
Baby won't you walk with me home

I hold your picture next to my heart all the time
You're my dream come true so imagine your mine 
And I wonder how it would be if 
I was your lady 
And you were my friend

I would put my heart in your hand and it would never end

Baby won't you walk me home
Baby won't you take my hand 
Come with me now to a special land
Baby won't you walk with me home

Everyday and night I wanna hold you (hold you) 
Understand that I am gonna love you in my own special way

Walk me home
I don't want to go all the way alone
Baby would you walk with me  home

If you take my hand 
Come with me now to a special land 
Baby would you walk with me home

Baby would you walk with me home 
I don't want to go all the way alone
Baby would you walk with me home---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
