( I had you, I had everything I ever needed)

Verse 1
From that first look i knew i found heaven in your eyes
But who was to know the way it would go
I have no regrets, Glad I let you in
Wouldn't have missed one single moment 
I would do it all over again

Chorus
Cause I was loved, I was touched
And I learned what love is
And i learned what love is
I was blessed, so blessed
Cause I learned what love is 
I learned what love is 
From loving you

( I held you, I held everything I ever dreamed of)

Verse 2
With that first kiss from you 
Oh this world seemed oh so right
But who was to see the way it would be
I'll never forget all the heaven we shared
And I thank God for every moment
Every moment that I had you there

Chorus

Some people search their whole lives
Never find what I found in your eyes
Glad I got to get the chance to have you in my life
I won't be sad when i look back
Cause I was, I was loved, I was touched 
And i learned what love is
And I learned what love is
I was blessed, so blessed
Cause I learned what love is 
I learned what love is 
From loving you

I learned what love is .....
From loving you---Lyrics submitted by Chloe.
