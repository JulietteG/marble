Hey hey, 
The clouds are whey, 
There's straw for the donkeys, 
And the innocents can all sleep safely, 
All sleep safely. 

My, my, 
Sun is pie, 
There's fodder for the cannons, 
And the guilty ones can all sleep safely, 
All sleep safely. 

And all the world is football shaped, 
It's just for me to kick in space, 
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste, 
And I've got one, two, three, four, five 
Senses working overtime, 
Trying to take this all in, 
I've got one, two, three, four, five 
Senses working overtime, 
Trying to taste the difference, 
'Tween the lemons and limes, 
The pain and the pleasure, 
And the church bells softly chime. 

Hey hey, 
Night fights day, 
There's food for the thinkers, 
And the innocents can all live slowly, 
All live slowly, 
My, my, 
The sky will cry, 
Jewels for the thirsty, 
And the guilty one's can all die slowly 
All die slowly. 

And all the world is biscuit shaped, 
It's just for me to feed my face, 
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste, 
And I've got one, two, three, four, five, 
Senses working overtime, 
Trying to take this all in, 
I've got one, two, three, four, five, 
Senses working overtime, 
Trying to taste the difference, 
'Tween the lemons and limes, 
The pain and the pleasure, 
And the church bells softly chime, 

And birds might fall from black skies, 
And bullies might give you black eyes, 
And busses might skid on black ice, 
But to me it's very very beautiful, 
(England's glory!) 
Beautiful 
(a striking beauty!) 

And all the world is football shaped, 
It's just for me to kick in space, 
And I can see, hear, smell, touch, taste, 
And I've got one, two, three, four, five, 
Senses working overtime, 
Trying to take this all in, 
I've got one,two,three, four, five 
Senses working overtime, 
Trying to tell the difference, 
'Tween the goods and crimes, 
Dirt or treasure, 
And there's one, two, three, four,five 
Senses working overtime, 
Trying to take this all in, 
I've got one, two, three, four, five, 
Senses working overtime, 
Trying to taste the difference, 
'Tween the lemons and limes, 
The pain and the pleasure, 
And the church bells softly chime.
