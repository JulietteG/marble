We can't play this game anymore but
Can we still be friends?
Things just can't go on like before but
Can we still be friends?

We had something to learn
Now it's time for the wheel to turn
Grains of sand, one by one
Before you know it, all gone

Let's admit we made a mistake but
Can we still be friends?
Heartbreak's never easy to take but
Can we still be friends?

It's a strange, sad affair
Sometimes seems like we just don't care
Don't waste time feeling hurt
We've been through hell together

Can we still be friends?
Can we still get together sometimes?
Can we still be friends?
You know that life will still go on

We awoke from our dream
Things are not always what they seem
Memories linger on
It's like a sweet, sad, old song

Can we still be friends?
Can we still get together sometimes?
Can we still be friends?
You know that life will still go on

Can we still be friends?
Can we still get together sometimes?
Can we still be friends?
You know that life will still go on---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
