Purple skies, vivid dreams
When you breath next to me
Now your heart is in the gold
There is a mystery that I wanna know

No more hurt into feel
In the dark we can glow
Past the night, there is a field
where the rainbows always shining down
Now we just gotta let them know
Yeah
Yeah, we just gotta let them know
Let it show
And we just gotta let then know
Yeah
Cuz time waits for no one

So bring out your colors
Bring out your colors and make it bright
Turn up your colors
We gotta let them know
Let them know
Let them know

So bring out your colors
Bring out your colors and make it bright
Turn up your colors
We gotta let them know
Let them know
We gotta let them know
Let them know
We gotta let them know
Let them know

Colors
Kaleidoscopes will appear
As we crash into love
Flashing lights as we ride
Leaving everything we left behind

No more hurt into feel
In the dark we can glow
Past the night there is a field
Where rainbows always shining down

Now we just gotta let them know
Yeah
Yeah, we just gotta let them know
Let it show
And we just gotta let them know
Yeah, yeah
Cuz time waits for no one

So bring out your colors
Bring out your colors and make it bright
Turn up your colors
We gotta let them know
Let them know

So bring out your colors
Bring out your colors and make it bright
Turn up your colors
We gotta let them know
Let them know
Colors---
