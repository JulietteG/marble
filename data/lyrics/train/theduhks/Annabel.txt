Annabel Annabel Where did you go?
Ive looked high and Ive looked low
Ive looked low and Ive looked high
Tell me where does the spirit go when you die?
Oh where does the spirit go when you die?

I have packed your satin gloves and lace
All the pictures of your pretty face
And I kept the ones of you on skates
And a picture from your wedding day

Annabel Annabel way up high
Are you kissing the starry birds in the sky
Will you come and visit us down below
Oh Annabel Annabel where did you go
Annabel where did you go?

You will miss the humming of the spring
And the winter wont mean anything
And the summer is a lonesome dale
I am lost without you Annabel
I have lost my faith in everything
Annabel Annabel are you free?
Will you wrap me in your legacy?
In a blanket with your sweet perfume
I am always thinking thoughts of you.

Annabel Annabel where did you go?
Ive looked high and Ive looked low
Oh Ive looked low and Ive looked high
Tell me where does the spirit go when you die?
Oh where does the spirit go when you die?---
