If I ever ever did stray
Would you come back, come back to me?
But you can't call a dog home
No, you can't call a dog home if you don't know it's name

Just as long as you gon' get home, you get home
Just as long as you gon' get home, you get home

Cause she's a million miles away
Oh, a million shores away
And all I can think about, sailing back
Having you here by my side

Oh, stay here with me, don't go!
Oh, stay here with me, don't go!---
