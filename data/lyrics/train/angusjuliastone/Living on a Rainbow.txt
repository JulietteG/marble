Who will lead us when our faith is all but gone
who will be the light when daylight doesnt come
Who will be the ones to sacrifice their souls
who will be the men to live just for love

I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow

I can see now how the child can grow old
and I can see just how the darkness takes it's hold
and I have seen how the compromise is made
and I can see how a light can loose his way

I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow

Who will lead us when our faith is all but gone
who will be the light when daylight doesnt come
Who will be the ones to sacrifice their souls
who will be the men to live just for love

I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
I've been living on a rainbow
I was living on a rainbow
