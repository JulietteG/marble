you
you and i made a pact
a deal that as we lay dying
we'd think about eachother then
and smile as we're taken in

i
i listened like a little child
to the story of your earthbound pilot
he plummeted so violent
a parachute not opening
and rushing to oblivion
he broke into that knowing grin

i
i think about that a lot
cause a lot is what i've not got
and a smile is what i least expect
in the clutches of this darkness

you
you i was surprised to hear
your birdsong velvet in my ear
the phone broke its silent stint
i pulled the cord and i needed it
you billowed like a bowl of silk
and slowed me from my ruining---Lyrics submitted by shineon.
