Now I don't even know the reason why I'm in this 
Crazy messed up world to begin with 
But I'm just trying to make the most of it (most of it) 
It's more than I can say for most of it 

See this world had me feeling like i nearly lost my mind 
Wakin' up to that same feeling all the time 
It's was like I was, getting by just swinging from a thread tho 
Barely hanging on and still I didn't wanna let go 
Through all the errors and the effort there's a lesson I learned 
It's pretty hard to get the best when you're expecting the worst 
It seems simple enough, so why do I make it so hard? 
I don't know but I do... 
And some days I lament it but hey 
It's better than the mundane life that I had (shit) 
Relying on cheap thrills and refills to be filled 
Walking a line where 
You become a lot of things but you're never quite you 
Till life becomes another thing that you never quite do 
And too many of us live like that, in the grips of the mind 
But I'm guessing that why this is life and 

"Some want the money, some want the throne 
Some don't really care and then some they want both 
It gets deep in the game we play 
I guarantee it'll stay the same" 
You know it goes like... 

I nearly came to breakdown, trying to figure this maze out 
Face down getting sick of that cynical sane frown, but 
Now, see I'm refining my escape route 
And its got me thinking i can finally find my way out... 
To lay down was never an option 
I figure losing in the game is better than watching 
Don't you? After all of this shit that we go through 
Yet this whole sees only so few, make it out 
Doubt keeps the many tame 
So the ready keep forgetting that they can escape 
And wait till its too late to then explore 
Or fade away while wishing they made a way to press pause 
It's never coming tho... 
Nah it's like yeah there's another road, there 
Still but there's no way I'm ever gonna go 
So instead I'm getting back back to the 
Place where most exist and it goes like this, it goes 

CHORUS 

But I see now that just ain't right 

See now at every show I've got, people there only really just want one song 
But thinking where I've come from, i ain't gonna run from it never 
I'm not gonna lie... there's nights when I 
Feel like my world is closing in... 
But I just try to keep in mind what I've been focused on since day one 
Man coz really I'm still hoping that that day comes 
Names come and go, yeah I know 
But there's a part of me that's sure that I won't, and as I grow 
I see a lot of new fans tagging along on the bandwagon 
And tho it feels good to finally be in a place where you have them 
It wasn't always that trend thinking back when 
Everybody's ignoring ya, now they're like hey 
We probably should've supported ya, it's ok 
Shit I'm not holding a grudge 
I'm just glad you're not around to keep on holding me up, in this world where---Lyrics submitted by Harley Piper.
