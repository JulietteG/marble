Well I'm coming home again
on a future missing plane
and there's water on the window
a message in the rain

Just when I thought all was lost
nothing could describe it
If you' re fighting for a cause
nobody should hide it

Here's my excuse, here's my excuse
and I don't know any better
who do you lose, who do you lose
when you don't know any better

Well I'm driving home again
try to lose the pain she gain
and the radio explains
someone else just took my place

Here's my excuse, here's my excuse
and I don't know any better
Falling for you, falling for you
cause I don't know any better

You think we are all the same..
You think I'll never change..---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
