Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you married?" We'll say "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter
Walking in a winter
Walking in a winter wonderland ---
