I made the same mistake before
Too many malls, too many stores
December traffic, Christmas rush
It breaks me 'till I push and shove

Children are crying 
While mothers are trying to
Photograph santa and sleigh
Shopping and buying
And standing forever in line
What can I say?

[Chorus:]
I need a silent night 
A holy night
To hear an angel voice 
Through the chaos and noise
I need a midnight clear
A little piece right here
To end this crazy day
With a silent night

December comes, then disappears
Faster and faster every year
Can my own mother
Keep this pace?
Or was the word a different place?

Where people stayed home 
Wishing for snow
Watching three channels on their t.v.
Look at us now
Rushing around 
Trying to buy Christmas peace

[Chorus:]
I need a silent night
A holy night 
To hear an angel voice 
Through the chaos and the noise
I need a midnight clear
A little piece right here
To end this crazy day
With a silent night

What was it like back there 
In Bethlehem
With peace on earth
Good will to our men

There were shepherds out on the fields
Keeping watch over their flocks by night
And the glory of the lord shown around them
And they were so afraid
And the angel said
Fear not for behold I bring you good news of a great joy
That shall be for all people
For unto you is born this day
A savior who is Christ the Lord
And his name shall be called 
Wonderful Counselor 
Prince of Peace

[Chorus:]
I need a silent night 
A holy night 
To hear an angel voice through the chaos and the noise
I need a midnight clear
A little piece right here
To end this crazy day 
With a silent night

To end this crazy day
With a silent night---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
