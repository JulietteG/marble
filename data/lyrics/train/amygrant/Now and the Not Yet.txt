No longer what we were before, but not all that we will be
Tomorrow when we lock the door on all our compromising
When He appears, He'll draw us near
And we'll be changed by His glory
Wrapped up in His glory

We will be like Him
For we shall see Him as He is
No longer what we saw before, but not all that we will see
Tomorrow when we lock the door on all our disbelieving
When He appears, our view will clear
And we'll be changed by His glory
Wrapped up in His glory

But I'm caught in between the now and the not yet
Sometimes it feels like forever and ever
That I've been reaching to be all that I am
But I'm only a few steps nearer
Yet I'm nearer

No longer what we were before, but not all that we will be
Tomorrow when we lock the door on all our compromising
And He appears, He'll draw us near
And we'll be changed by His glory
Wrapped up in His glory

When He appears, He'll draw us near
And we'll be changed by His glory
Wrapped up in His glory---Lyrics submitted by Noel.
