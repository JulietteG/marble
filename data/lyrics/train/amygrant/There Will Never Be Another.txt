My Father's Eyes
There Will Never Be Another
There will never be another
Who will love me like you.
There will never be another
Who could hold me, mold me.
There will never be another
Who could love me purely.
No, there will never be another
Who has loved me like you.

And i know that there will never be another love
Who could ever be the love that you are.
'cause you had so much to lose, but still you gave it up
For your scars.
But that's the way you are.

And if i spent my life attending universities,
Educated in the wisdom of men,
And if i could even quote a guy like socrates,
Even then,
I couldn't comprehend

That there will never be another
Who will love me like you.
There will never be another
Who could hold me, mold me.
There will never be another
Who could love me purely.
No, there will never be another
Who has loved me like you.

And i know i'll never understand the mystery
If i live to be a hundred and three,
How you died to live the love you give to me.

That there will never be another
Who will love me like you.
There will never be another
Who could hold me, mold me.
There will never be another
Who could love me purely.
No, there will never be another
Who has loved me like you.

There will never be another
Who has loved me like you.---Lyrics submitted by katti.
