Its been a long long time since everthing was cool
I should have seen it coming but 
I guess i'm not the only fool

There's something growing on the outside
Too much missing on the inside
Should i waste my time and let you lead me
on and on and on and on

[Chours]
Waiting for the day when i'm complete
Without you i'm doing what i can to let you be
Making sure there's nothing showing on the outside
Somthing's dying on the inside
I'm still broken but i'm free
I'll see you on the flipside

I've got a bruised up heart but i'm still hanging out
I should take it easy but i'm still gonna get around
Theres somehting growing on the outside 
Too much missing on the inside
Should i waste more time when everything is done and done and overdone

Waiting for the day when i'm complete
Without you i'm doing what i can to let you be
Maknig sure there's nothing showing on the outside
Somthing's dying on the inside
I'm still broken but i'm free
I'll see you on the flipside

I'll see you on the flipside

Nothing showing on the outside 
Something's dying on the inside

Waiting for the day when i'm complete
Doing what i can to let you be

Nothing showing on the outside 
Something's dying on the inside

I'm still broken but i'm free
I'll see you on the flipside---Lyrics submitted by Mafia.
