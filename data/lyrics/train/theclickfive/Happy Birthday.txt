Hey you 
I know i'm in the wrong
Time flies when your having fun 
You wake up another year is gone 
Your twenty-one

I guess u wanna know 
Why i'm on the phone
Its been a day a soul

I know its kinda late but happy birthday 

[Chours]
I know your angry
Well i miss you too (Yea yea i know)

I know its kinda late but happy birthday

So hard when your far away
Its lame but i've forgot the date
I wont make the same mistake 
I'm so to blame

So now u know
Dont hang up the phone
I wish i was at home

I know its way too late but happy birthday

I know your angry
Well i miss you too (Yea yea i know)

I know its kinda late but happy birthday

Its not that i dont care
Though i will make it up to you
If i could i been there

Well i miss you too (Yea yea i know)

I know its kinda late but happy birthday

I know your angry
Well i miss you too (Yea yea i know)

I know its kinda late but happy birthday to you---Lyrics submitted by Mafia.
