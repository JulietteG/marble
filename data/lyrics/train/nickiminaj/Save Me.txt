I drove for miles just to find you in my mind
Self only screams all these voices in my head
You gave me strength gave me hope for a lifetime
I never was satisfied

This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up
This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up

Giving up, giving up (2x)
Giving up

It's not your fault
Ima **** ima monster
Yes Ima beast and I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone on my throne, all these witches
I came this way all this way just to say

This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up
This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up

Giving up, giving up (2x)
Giving up

I'm giving up baby yes I'm giving up baby
It seems like I've been driving for miles
Yes I'm giving up baby
And I can't seem to silent these voices in my head
This time won't you save me?
Come save me
This time won't you save me?
Come save me

This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself giving up giving up
This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself giving up giving up

This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself giving up giving up
