So so hot in here it feels like a jungle (yeah)

One time bust a shot for my champion girls

Kn kn know I got the ammo, that's why I bulletproofed the Lambo 
In the Middle East on a camel 
Running through the jungle, Rambo 
Liberaces hand go 
Swinging on a vine, mango (mango) 
So call me Simba little mama 
Cause Mufasa couldnt stop a bitch 
I fly in on that choppa just to buy Balenciaga 
Its just me, Mr. Miyagi, and the phantom of the opera 
Goin' blocka muthafucka
