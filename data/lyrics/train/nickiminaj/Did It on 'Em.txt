[Chorus]
Shitted on em, man I just shitted on em
Shitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em
Shitted on em, man I just shitted on em
Shitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em

[Verse 1]
All these bitches is my sons
and Ima go and get some bibs for em
a couple formulas, little pretty lids on em
If i had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on em
Let me shake it off
I just signed a couple deals i might break you off
and we aint making up I dont need a mediator
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator

[Chorus]
Shitted on em, man I just shitted on em
Shitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em
Shitted on em, man I just shitted on em
Shitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em

[Verse 2]
This stone is flawless F1
I keep shooters up top in the F1
a lot of bitches beggin me to eff one
but Ima eat them rap bitches when the chef come
Throw some fresh ones
more talent in my mufuckin left thumb
she aint a Nicki fan then the bitch def dumb
you aint my son you my muthafuckin step-son

[Chorus]
Shitted on em, man I just shitted on em
Shitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em
Shitted on em, man I just shitted on em
Shitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em

[Verse 3]
All these bitches is my sons
and I aint talking bout Phoenix
bitch I get money so I dos what i pleases
I live where the muthafuckin pools and the trees is
broke bitches so crusty (disgust me)
gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty
trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff b
couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me (EW)
Im the terminator bitch talk slick Ima have to terminate her
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator
you my seed I spray you with germinator
Move back bugs matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used the be here but now you gone Nair

[Chorus]

Shitted on em, man I just shitted on em
Shitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em
Shitted on em, man I just shitted on em
Shitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em---Lyrics submitted by Echo Maglasang.
