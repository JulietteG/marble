Step-tep-tep-tep un in the party like my name was bad bitch,
All these haters mad because im so established,
They know i'm a beast, yeah im a fuckin savage
Haters you can kill yourself.
I'm a space shuttle and im not comin down,
I'm a stereo and shes just so monotone,
sometimes its just me and all my bottles all alone,
I aint comin' back this time.

I cant believe it,

this club is heatin,
this party's blazin,
I cant believe it,
this beat is bangin,
I cant believe it,

Step-tep-tep in in the party like my name was mr. T,
All these hatin naggers aint got nathing on me,
Honestly i gotta stay as fly as i can be,
If you like your willy, you get super OG.
Honeys always rush me cause im fly fly fly,
Dumb as they touch me cause im floatin sky high,
I stay niggerific, you dont need to ask why,
You just gotta see with yo eyes.

I cant believe it,

this party's blazin,
I cant believe it,
this beat is bangin,
I cant believe it,
i cant believe it.

Competition, why yes i would love some,
How the fuck they get mead cause they run done,

Man i cant even handle all the hundreds,
Duffle bag everytime i go to Sun trust,
I leave the rest just to collect intrust,

i just pop up on these hoes like some pimple shit,
And put an iron to your face you old wrinckled bitch.

This is mega nigga.

Oh we just had to kill it,
we on the radio hotter than a skillet,
We in the club makin party people holla,
Money in the bank means we gettin top dolla,
Im a big balla,

step up to my level, need to grow a lil taller,
Im a sharp caller,

You a chihuaha.

I cant believe it,
