Red One
Lets go to the beach, each
Lets go get away
They say, what they gonna say?
Have a drink, clink, found the Bud Light
Bad bitches like me, is hard to come by
The Patrn, on, lets go get it on
The zone, on, yes Im in the zone
Is it two, three, leave a good tip
Ima blow up my money and dont give two shits

Im on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more, til I cant stand
Get on the floor, floor
Like its your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Cant stop cause were so high
Lets do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Lets do this one last time
Hands up...

(Were higher than a motherfucker) [x3]

Jump in my hooptie hooptie hooptie hoop
I own that
And I aint paying my rent this month
I owe that
But fuck who you want, and fuck who you like
Theres no light, theres no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star

Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money cause today's pay day
And if youre a G, you a G-G-G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

Get on the floor, floor
Like its your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Cant stop cause were so high
Lets do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Lets do this one last time
Hands up...

(Were higher than a motherfucker) [x3]

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Cant stop cause were so high
Lets do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Lets do this one last time
Hands up...
