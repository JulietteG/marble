Pictures of you
Oh they're still on my mind
You had this smile
That could light up the world
Now when it rains it seems
The sun never shines

And I drive
Down this lonely, lonely road
Oh I got this feelin'
Girl I gotta let you go

Cause now you've to fly (fly high)
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart
And flowers bloom in your name
Woahh oh
You've got to fly (fly high),
Fly to the angels
All the stars in the night
Shine in your name

Though it hurts me way deep inside
When I turn and look and find
That your not there
I try to convince myself
But the pain,
The pain is still not gone

Still I drive
Down this lonely, lonely road
Oh I got this feeling,
Girl I've got to let you go

But now you've got to fly (fly high)
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart
And flowers bloom in your name

Whoa
You've got to fly (fly high)
Fly to the angels
All the stars in the night
Shine in your name

Fly

And still I drive down
This lonely, lonely road
Oh I got this feeling
Oh, I can't let you go

But I know
That you've got to fly (fly high)
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart
And flowers bloom in your name
Whoa oh oh oh
You've got fly (fly high)
Fly to the angels
All the stars in the sky
Shine in your name,yeah

Ow
oh oh oh oh oh oh
baby, oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh yea
oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna miss you
miss you girl---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
