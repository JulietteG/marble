What's he doing with her man
You know that's that bird
I was telling you about
That messed around
With me and my bro
Ya know I might be young
But I'm not naive ya see
This girl could chew you up
And spit you out
Even after a damn big lunch
So look out boys
Cuz she's a loaded gun
She looked just like
An ordinary girl
How was I supposed to know
She knew the world
Outranked, shellshocked, shrapnel
From the time before
I thought she was the girl
That I was lookin' for
She's like a loaded gun
She's gotta getcha, getcha
Loaded gun... Shoot, shoot, shoot
Loaded gun... Fire.... Loaded gun
Cold as fire with
Shotgun in her eyes
She's got notches in her belt
From the other guys
When she gets ya on her sights
It's like dynamite
She can blow an army apart
She'll shoot a bullet into your heart
I'm tellin' all your soldiers
Now listen to my plan
Go to battle stations
It's red alert
Let's get her while we can
Like a loaded gun
Way deep inside
When I turn and look
And find that you're not there
I try to convince myself
That the pain, the pain
It's still not gone.

Cause what ever you do
It comes back to you
Right back to you babe, I'll tell ya
Burnin' bridges fallin' down
Got a nasty reputation
From town to town
Burnin' bridges fallin' down
Burnin' bridges fallin' down on you
Mirror morror on the way
It always tells you
That you are the best of all
Maybe you're too blind to see
That you're heading for a fall---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
