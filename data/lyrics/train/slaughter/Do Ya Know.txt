It's an illusion in your mind
Imagination runs wild
Well are you satisfied 'cause the picture you paint is so blue
Or do you close your eyes to live the other side
When you're lookin' in the mirror there is no one in sight
[Chorus:]
Do you really know who you are
So ya wanna change your life
Do you really know who you are
'Cause you're gonna have to face it
Tell me why
Why do you cry out in vain
Lost in confusion, is your game
Well are you satisfied 'cause the picture you paint is so blue
Or do you close your eyes to live the other side
When you're lookin' in the mirror there is no one in sight
[Chorus:]
You won't remember what you've done
And now you live life on the run
[Chorus:]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
