Home sweet home
Las Vegas brothers
Oh no, you drive me crazy

Don't you know, know, know
What you're doin' to me
Only you drive me wild
You're my ecstasy

Can't you tell
By the look in my eyes
That I love you
I've gotta show you
What I feel in my heart
'Cause I knew it
Right from the start

That I'm mad about you
I go crazy with
All of the things that you do
I'm mad about you
I'm so angry inside
And it's all over you
I'm mad about you

Don't you go, go, go
Too far away
I need you close by my side
Always here to stay

Can't you tell
By the look in my eyes
That I love you
I've gotta show you
What I feel in my heart
'Cause I knew it
Right from the start

That I'm mad about you
I go crazy with
All of the things that you do
I'm mad about you
I'm so angry inside
And it's all over you

It's been a long time baby
Ooh, I keep this brewin' inside
I can't take anymore
Oh girl, I'm mad about you

I'm mad about you
Can't you tell
When I look in your eyes
I'm mad about you

I'm mad about you
I go crazy with
All of the things that you do
I'm mad about you
I'm so angry inside
And it's all over you

I'm mad about you
I go crazy with
All of the things that you do
I'm mad about you
I'm so angry inside
And it's all over you

Can't you see
When you look in your eyes
Tell me girl, girl---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
