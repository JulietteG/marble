Well alright
Yeah, yeah

I'm in the mood, it's time to go out tonight
You're feeling good
Pulsating, going faster than the speed of light, yeah, yeah
I feel it touch me, oh don't ya know
That it's never loud enough for me

You've got to move to the music
You've got to live on rock and roll, yeah, yeah
You've got to move to the music
Don't ya know it's good for your soul

Out on the town, saw this girl she looked so fine
I'll tell ya now, oh I love it
When I feel her body movin' close to mine, yeah, yeah
I feel it touch me, oh don't ya know
That it's never loud enough for me

You've got to move to the music
You've got to live on rock and roll yeah, yeah
You've got to move to the music
Don't ya know it's good for your soul

Yeah, yeah
You've got to move to the music
Come on move, move, move
Can you feel it

You've got to move to the music
You've got to live on rock and roll yeah, yeah
You've got to move to the music
Don't ya know it's good for your soul

Move, move, move
[Incomprehensible]

You've got to move to the music
You've got to move to the music
You've got to move to the music
You've got to move to the music
You've got to move to the music---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
