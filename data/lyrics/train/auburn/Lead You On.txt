The other day I was just a little curious
Led me to the bed baby you were gettin' serious
I didn't want us to get (To this)
Think I'm en(trusted)
In you more than a friend.

I always noticed all the looks
You give me in class
When a guy would smil at me
I smile back and you get mad.
I shoulda talked to you
(About us)

And told you where 
(My hope was)
I shoulda let it in and I

I think It's time for me 
To walk away
It hurts for me to leave
But even more to stay

I want you to know that
I still love you
I still want to be your friend
(No)

I didn't want to lead you on
Lead you on
Lead you on
Didn't want to lead you on
Lead you on
Lead you on 

No don't ever think 
I don't value this relationship
Didn't mean to lead you on
So now I gotta call it quits
I know it hurts 

You know it hurts
(Me too)
Gotta me and I
(Hurt you)
Am I a better friend
(No)

Don't just turn away from me
Boy I'm tryna talk to you
Why can't we just be cool
Me and you like we used to do

I understand if you don't want to
(Deal with)
Me and how I
(Do this)
This just gotta end
Yeah!

I think It's time for me 
To walk away
It hurts for me to leave
But even more to stay

I want you to know that
I still love you
I still want to be your friend
(No)

I didn't want to lead you on
Lead you on
Lead you on
Didn't want to lead you on
Lead you on
Lead you on 

(Oooh I think it's time)

I think It's time for me 
To walk away
It hurts for me to leave
But even more to stay

I want you to know that
I still love you
I still want to be your friend
(No)

I didn't want to lead you on
Lead you on
Lead you on
Didn't want to lead you on
Lead you on
Lead you on---Lyrics submitted by Jamie.
