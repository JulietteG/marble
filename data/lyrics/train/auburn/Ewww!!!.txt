My Snare 
Chellie B
Wat up Gabby G
Wat u say when a tillzy lookin neezy come up to u

[[Chorus]]
Me and my girl stepped in the function sayin
Youeeooeeooeeooee
You walked up and said baby girl what it 
Doeeooeeooeeooee
And we like naw beezy we
cooleeooeeooeeooee
In the back of our mind we thinkin he
Ewwweeooeeooeeooee

But it's ok, it's alright
You got something that we dont like
But it's ok, it's alright
You got something that she might like


[[Verse 1]]
Allow me to introduce myself they call me Gabby G
I just stepped in the function wit ma girl Chellie B
My people yea we meet up
We juiced up from the feet up
And he wanted to meet us
But he was kinda beat up
Now tell me how it look wit a Coca Cola Mackin Model
Leavin da function wit a crushed up water bottle
Im sorry baby boy but thats just
Not my motto
But like Sean Kingston I might leave u suicidal


[[Pre Chorus]]
I got a confession
Baby boy your affection
Is in the wrong direction
I just got more selection


[[Chorus]]
Me and my girl stepped in the function sayin
Youeeooeeooeeooee
You walked up and said baby girl what it 
Doeeooeeooeeooee
And we like naw beezy we
cooleeooeeooeeooee
In the back of our mind we thinkin he
Ewwweeooeeooeeooee

But it's ok, it's alright
You got something that we dont like
But it's ok, it's alright
You got something that she might like


[[Verse 2]]
Allow me to introduce myself they call me Chellie B
I just stepped out the function wit my girl Gabby G
