She could paint the sweetest picture
All that we're animated by, contaminated lies
And before you knew what you were missing
Find yourself whispering a name, playing all her games
I'm not the only one who wants to get away
But it's too easy just to stay

Every night I close my eyes
And wake up in her grip, the poison on my lips
Every place I pitch my case 
She's turning me to stone, lost and I am far from home, yeah

Never waited for your cue
Fell hopelessly for you, there was nothing else
There was nothing I could do
All the things that I was thinking you were gonna be and I was gonna see
Just a fantasy, had a hold on me
I'm not the only one who wants to get away
But it's too easy just to stay, so

Every night I close my eyes
And wake up in her grip, the poison on my lips
Every place I pitch my case 
She's turning me to stone, lost and I am far from home

There's not much left here to call my own, yeah
There's no one left here to call my friend, yeah
Ooooooh, oooooh.....
I'm not the only one who wants to get away
But its too easy just to stay

Every night I close my eyes
And wake up in her grip, the poison on my lips
Every place I pitch my case 
She's turning me to stone, lost and I am far from home, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Far from home

Every night I close my eyes and wake up, hey, hey, baby
Every night I close my eyes and wake up, so far---Lyrics submitted by Lewie Stevens.
