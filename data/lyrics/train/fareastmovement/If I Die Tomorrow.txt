Take that jello, this your jam
This that flavor for your pants
Drop that top, funk that trunk
Hands up, let me see you dance
Kill that bottle, lets get nice
Hit that clock, its about that time
Pop that vial, last all night
Get that wrong, dont think twice
Say POW!
Let me see you break that back
Girl, go crazy
You got that Superbad
Girl, damn thats right
The way you throw that in my lap
Unh, you so crazy
And if you aint got time to act
Double time girl
Shake it fast---
