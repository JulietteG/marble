Rollin' down the avenue
I got my fist in the air
Checkin' out of the rat race
& I really don't care

I got a knock-down draggin' out fight in my mind
Attitude's a kick in the face
I'm just havin' a good time
Just havin' a good time

Don't ask what the truth is
& I won't tell you no lies
'Cause love can be a BitchSlap, honey
A bleedin' heart in disguise

Livin' in the stratosphere
Ain't always cloud nine
I don't even know if
It's what I was hopin' to find

I got a knock-down draggin' out fight in my mind
Attitude's a kick in the face
Gettin' out of my mind,
I'm gettin' out of my mind

Don't ask what the truth is
& I won't tell you no lies
'Cause love can be a BitchSlap, honey
A bleedin' heart in disguise

Tryin' hard to push me one step over the line
I got the weight of the world on my back
I'll leave it all behind

Don't ask what the truth is
& I won't tell you no lies
'Cause love can be a BitchSlap, honey
A bleedin' heart in disguise

Tryin' hard to fuck me one step over the line
I got the weight of the world on my back
I'll leave it all
I'll leave it all behind---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
