Once I was the youngest,
Now the middle branch hung from the family tree.
Older than my first-born brother,
Never made it quite to forty-three.

Let it ring.
Let the bell ring out for you.
May it sing
Of your beautiful truth.
Take your leave
On the risin tide.
Travel slow.
Enjoy the ride.

Everyone is waiting on the tickin bomb
That lies beneath their skin.
None the less we carry on
Like we were born for breathin poison in.

So, let it ring.
Let the bell ring out for you.
May it sing
Of your beautiful truth.
Take your leave
On the risin tide.
Travel slow.
Enjoy the ride.

Youre right where you belong,
Beneath blue Toowong skies,
Cut so deep in our bones.
You surround those of us you love.

So, let it ring.
Let the bell ring out for you.
May it sing
Of your beautiful truth.
Take your leave
On the risin tide.
Travel slow.
Enjoy the ride.

Let it ring.
Let the bell ring out for you.
May it sing
Of your beautiful truth.
Take your leave
On the risin tide.
Travel slow.
Enjoy the ride.---Lyrics submitted by Robyn Webster.
