making believe 
that you still love me
it's leaving me 
alone and so blue
i'll always dream, but i'll never own you
making believe
thats all i can do


making believe 
that you still love me
it's leaving me 
alone and so blue
i'll always dream, but i'll never own you
making believe
thats all i can do

i can't hold you close
darling, when you're not with me
you're somebody's love
you'll never be mine
making believe 
i'll spend this lifetime
loving you and making believe

i can't hold you close
darling, when you're not with me
you're somebody's love
you'll never be mine
making believe 
i'll spend this lifetime
loving you and making believe

i can't hold you close
darling, when you're not with me
you're somebody's love
you'll never be mine
making believe 
i'll spend this lifetime
loving you 
and making believe
just loving you
and making believe
just loving you
and making believe---Lyrics submitted by emil jensen.
