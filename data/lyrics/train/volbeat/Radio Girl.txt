Oh radio girl play that sweet heavenly song
Well it's Saturday night and we all get into town

Broken by heartache but driven by her sound
Well a spell from the speakers was tearing my soul apart
Oh radio man would you please play that song
One day I know that I'll marry that girl

Come home, baby I know it, please dial me up
Alone I roam

Cause the drive-in is closing, the movies out of work
But the music is playing in my old Bett Betty Ford
Oh radio man would you please play that song
One day I know that I'll marry that girl

Come home, baby I know it, please dial me up
Alone I roam

Standing in the rain with one coin for a booth call
Oh Madeline, the station told my that they didn't even know your name, FOR HELVEDE

Strolling to another city just to catch a song, oh Madeline
The frequency is better, but I'm freezing on a parking lot, it never ends

Broken by heartache but driven by her sound
Well a spell from the speakers was tearing my soul apart
Oh radio man would you please play that song
One day I know that I'll marry that girl

Come home, baby I know it, please dial me up
Alone I roam

Strolling to another city just to catch a song, oh Madeline
The frequency is better, but I'm freezing on a parking lot, it never ends---Lyrics submitted by Dessan.
