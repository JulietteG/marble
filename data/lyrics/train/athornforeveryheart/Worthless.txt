There are times in our lives
When we just can not compromise
Can't take advice
But can deny
All of the things wrong in our lives
Need a reason for a new dream
When it seems like dawn won't come
Search for answers
In the darkness
When it seems that there are none

I'm not coming home
There's nothing left there at all
Now I take this on my own

[We're part]
Of the bridges that we've crossed
[Forget]
Of the loved ones that we've lost
[Scream out]
Till your lungs fill up with blood
Shut up and wait for the break down

Eyes closed
What's the big deal?
Now darkness swallows me alive
Don't know
What's the matter?
Who cares 'cause it doesn't seem to matter now

I'm not coming home
There's nothing left there at all
[We are worthless we are lost]
Now I take this on my own
[We are reckless we are young]

x2
[We're part]
Of the bridges that we've crossed
[Forget]
Of the loved ones that we've lost
[Scream out]
Till your lungs fill up with blood
Shut up and wait for the break down (now)

If I can't sleep tonight
I'm going to have to toss and turn
And go wandering through my mind
For everything I'll never find
And now I'm somewhere in between
Safe from the obscene
And I just want to make you all believe

x4
We are worthless, we are numb
We are reckless, we are young
We are everything you aren't
We are worthless, we are lost---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
