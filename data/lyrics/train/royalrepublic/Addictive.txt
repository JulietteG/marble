I'm addic dic dicted to you

I'm addic dic dic dic dicted to you
You're addic dic dicted to me

Cocaine can't do it like you do it to me
My brain can't take it when you push it on me
And I stick like glue
When I'm sniffing you

Come and give me a fix
I'm addic dic dicted to you
Cocaine can't do it like you do it to me
My brain can't take it when you push it on me
And I stick like glue
When I'm sniffing you
I'm addic dick dick dick dick dick dick

Cause I'll always be a sucker for your dress
And I will always be a sucker for your meth 
So what are we?
You and me
She said baby save me you could be the he-hero-in me 

I'm addic dic dic dic dicted to you
I'm addic dic dicted
You're addicted to me
So ridiculously
I'm addic dic dicted to you

I'm addic dic dic dic dicted to you
You're addic dic dicted to me
I'm a slave for your kicks
Come and give me a fix
I'm addic dic dicted to you

Cocaine can't do it like you do it to me
My brain can't take it when you push it on me
And I stick like glue
When I'm sniffing you
I'm addic dick dick dick dick dick dick

Cause I'll always be a sucker for your dress
And I will always be a sucker for your meth 
So what are we?
You and me
What are we?
You and me
What are we?
What are we?
She said baby save me you could be the he-hero-in me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
