Lookin' at you through a misty moonlight
Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer nights beauty took my breath away

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Every night now once I've been back home
I lie awake at night drifting in my memory
I think about you on your momma's front porch swing
Talking that way so soft to me

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Oh....
Maybe it was Memphis.---Lyrics submitted by laurent.
