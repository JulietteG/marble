I'm the daughter of a workin' man
He built our world with his 2 hands
He gave us everything he had
I'm the daughter of a workin' man

I'm a restless girl from a red dirt town
Like a tumbleweed I rolled right out
The wind will bring me back around
Cause' I'm a restless girl from a red dirt town

And I don't know what's down the road from here
But I can only hope it's something good
If love is to be my compass
Then I'm fine with what's to come
Cause' part of knowing where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm from

There's a burning deep down in my soul
Like a field on fire out of control
Lights my way when I'm far from home
Yes there's a burning deep down in my soul

And I don't know what's down the road from here
But I can only hope it's something good
If love is to be my compass
Then I'm fine with what's to come
Cause' part of knowing where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm from
Where I'm from

And I don't know what's down the road from here
But I can only hope it's something good
If love is to be my compass
Then I'm fine with what's to come
Cause' part of knowing where I'm going
Is knowing where I'm from

I'm the daughter of a workin' man---
