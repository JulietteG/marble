Right time, the right place
The right body, the right face
Timber I'm falling in love

It started slow, it's coming fast
I got a feelin it's gonna last
Timber I'm falling in love

You're so pretty, look so sweet
Your love's sweepin me off of my feet
You're the only one I'm dreamin of
I can't believe that I'm falling in love

Who knows how love starts
I woke up with you in my heart
Timber I'm falling in love

You're so pretty, look so sweet
Your love's sweepin me off of my feet
You're the only one I'm dreamin of
I can't believe that I'm falling in love

Timber I'm falling in love
Timber I'm falling in love
Timber I'm falling in love ---
