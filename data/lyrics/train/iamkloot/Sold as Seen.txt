You know the place where faces fit 
I've heard they've got a name for it 
Lets go back to the sandy shores 
The velvet skies are ours once more 
We're fake, for real 
Our minds are steel 
Our eyes are green 
We're sold as seen 
I heard you joined the main parade 
A hero dressed in ticker-tape 
And go if all the worlds a trick 
I'll take the sky and measure it 
So leave your favourite photograph 
The only thing you had that lasts 
And go back to the sandy shores 
The velvet skies are ours once more 

There all for real 
There is no deal 
They're sold as seen 

You know the place where faces fit 
I've heard they've got a name for it 
Lets go back to the sandy shores 
The velvet skies are yours once more 

You're fake, for real 
Your minds are steel 
Your eyes are green 
You're sold as seen 
Sold as seen 

We're fake, for real 
Our minds are steel 
Our eyes are green 
We're sold as seen 
Sold as seen---Lyrics submitted by Beka.
