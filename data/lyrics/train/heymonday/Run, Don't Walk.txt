I am restless, and I keep trembling
Everyone watch me as I descend
Into a feeling that's overwhelming me
I finally stopped, stopped making sense

I can't stop talking to myself, I'm a desperate cry for help

Run don't walk the sky is falling through
Don't talk, tonight I'm so confused
I'm lost, I'm lost with you
I don't care where we are, or where were heading to
But I know I'm lost, I'm lost with you, with you

Your mouth keeps moving
But I've lost focus now
Clock keeps ticking, times running out
Where were heading there is no heading back
Tripping, ugly, I'm losing ground

I can't stop talking to myself, I'm a desperate cry for help

Run don't walk the sky is falling through
Don't talk, tonight I'm so confused
I'm lost, I'm lost with you
I don't care where we are, or where were heading to
But I know I'm lost, I'm lost with you, with you

For the record, when I'm with you
Things are looking better
For once everything is brighter
Than the darkness before you

Run don't walk the sky is falling through
Don't talk, tonight I'm so confused
I'm lost, I'm lost with you

Run don't walk the sky is falling through
Don't talk, tonight I'm so confused
I'm lost, I'm lost with you
I don't care where we are, or where were heading to
But I know I'm lost, I'm lost with you---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
