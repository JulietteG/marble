The storm is rushing on me
Here's the flood flash
I feel so locked and loaded
Let me out, let me out

Wake up in a wasteland
Where the trees are crashing fast
Make or break
The road explodes
Get out, get out of this town

Let the storm get stronger
Let us speed up
Or get blown over
Time's wasting
How much longer
Before I get myself free
Of these hurricane streets?

Headed for disaster
Way beyond the fear
In the rearview
Watch it all just disappear
Disappear

I don't care where I'm headed
Anywhere but here
Won't waste my life
Can't waste another night
In this town, this town

Let the storm get stronger
Let us speed up
Or get blown over
Time's wasting
How much longer
Before I get myself free
Of these hurricane...

Leaves are blowing down the streets
Wind crawling up our knees
Somebody get the keys
Rain is flowing from the sky
But no fear in our eyes
We're ready to fly

Let the storm get stronger
Let us speed up
Or get blown over
Time's wasting
How much longer
Before I get myself free
Of these hurricane streets? (x2)
