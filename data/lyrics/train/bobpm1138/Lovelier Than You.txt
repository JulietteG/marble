Maybe one day we can go
hand in hand down a golden road
and if i get there before you go
ill be waitin at the door,

in the future hopefully
we'll be together you and me
dont you worry baby please
cause honostly

if i could rewind
both the hands of time
still i would never find
a lovelier design
than you, nothing lovelier than you

maybe one day girl i pray
we can float off to space
hold my hand ill lead the way
and i wont let go and fall astray

aint no if, but and maybe's
your my baby, my lady
dont you worry baby please
cause honestly...

if i could rewind
both the hands of time
still i would never find
a lovelier design
than you, nothing lovelier than you

i'm dangerously, dangerously, dangerously in love
i love her more than i love myself but still that aint enough
if this a dream i dont wanna wake up
we go together like the tub and the shower head above
not even thousands and thousands of miles
could amount to my love,
i'd have countless sky miles
i'd climb up a mountain
climb right back down
i'd run across the world
then jog back around the---
noun and the verb is just a sound
and the word is not profound
enough to show my urge for her smile
i'd shout on the curb with a loud speaker
til the entire town heard, how i felt, and i'm out...---Lyrics submitted by jay.
