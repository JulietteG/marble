(feat. Trey Songz)

You will be mine
Even if you're somebody else's
Girl not for long
Girl not for long
Cause I'm your type
If you've got the wrong impression
Girl not for long, girl not for long

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow
Maybe at the club, maybe at the bar
I wanna show you off like a trophy car (whip it)
Cause anything is better than nothing at all
Nothing at all, nothing on you
I just wanna show you a table for two
All you did was go on a date with a dude
You know he don't fit, he ain't tailored for you
You just on a nigga dick cause cause he sold a brick
Has he ever wrote a hit on some poet shit?
That's who you chillin' on the sofa with?
I ain't trippin', in a minute it'll be over with, aye

You will be mine
Even if you're somebody else's
Girl not for long
Girl not for long
Cause I'm your type
If you've got the wrong impression
Girl not for long, girl not for long

Oooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(But not for long)
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

Oooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(But not for long)
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

When they see us together, hell naw they can't stand it
I wonder if you're matchin' you bras with them panties
A gorgeous skin tan, hit the mall and do damage
The way she hit the high notes, we all gon' have Grammys
This marble not granite
(Tiptoein')
From the counter, to the shower, for a hour
Super powers, super powers
That's that mojo, Austin Powers
Search "real nigga", I'ma pop up in your browser
Aye, so go and get your body wet
Panties off, we ain't made it to the lobby yet
Put you on game girl so it's obvious
I gave you the world if you ain't got it yet
Bobby

You will be mine
Even if you're somebody else's
Girl not for long
Girl not for long
Cause I'm your type
If you've got the wrong impression
Girl not for long, girl not for long

Oooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(But not for long)
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

Oooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(But not for long)
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

You might leave with someone else
But I still see that you fiend a be with a G like me
You'll never need, no one else
And I know you know
I'ma be like I told you so

You will be mine
Even if you're somebody else's
Girl not for long
Girl not for long
Cause I'm your type
If you've got the wrong impression
Girl not for long, girl not for long

Oooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(But not for long)
Girl not for long
Girl not for long---
