God

God came down from heaven yesterday
gave me somethin everybody else threw away
found it made my life  much beter than before
to tell you the truth I cant explain too much at all

I cant tell anybody
what happened to me
I cant tell anybody
How does that make you feel

Crossin the street and the lights all look the same
but people seem hypnotized and incapable of change
You start up your engines and you run all your life
tryin to find somewhere where you finally have time

I cant tell anybody what happened to me
I cant tell anybody how does that make you feel

time is a concept, that ruins everything
time was a mistake, everything is
the whole is impossible to a tiny little mind
gotta take the leap of faith and leave  death far behind

I cant tell anybody
what happened to me
I cant tell anybody
How does that make you feel

I cant tell anybody
the answer is an obvious thing
I cant tell anybody
What am I supposed to sing---Lyrics submitted by Abraham.
