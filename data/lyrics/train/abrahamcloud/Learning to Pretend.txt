When you wake up in the morning,
Can of beer in your hand,
And your mouth feels like a pillow,
And your head is hurting bad,

When the wind comes crawling through your window,
Calling you to follow it again,
You might feel that your life is not your own Its always waiting up around the bend,

LEARNING TO PRETEND

As you drive down crowded freeways,
Bright-White-Fear fills your eyes,
And you think you feel so desperate,
But we all feel that way most the time.

Dont be scared of fantastic new illusions
They may turn out to be your only friends,
Find a groove and let it
take you down the highway,
You might never find
that kind of groove again,

LEARNING TO PRETEND
And the magic of the moment just lasts an instant  When you see it gotta grab it, Wont be hangin round, Wont be hangin round for too long.

LEARNING TO PRETEND
LEARNING ALL YOUR LIFE THEN   YOURE LEARNING ONCE AGAIN
LEARNING TO PRETEND

When the view you used to be so used to
Gets flattened by some fat and angry men,
And you cant remember why you came here
but youre leaving once again, youre
