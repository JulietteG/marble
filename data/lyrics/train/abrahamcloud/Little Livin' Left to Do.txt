All around this town
 theyve been knockin me down,
Sayin Im a hopeless case.
Theyve seen me drunk
on the street too many times,
Fallin down on my face.
I know the drinkins gotta go,
But it feels so good sometimes,
To reset your mind to the universal time,
and simply let your fleshy body go.

 RAISE YOUR GLASS TO ME
CAUSE ILL BE QUITTIN SOON
TIL THEN,
 I GOT LITTLE LIVIN LEFT TO DO

Lazy afternoon in the middle of June,
And the sun has been so kind,
Girls are laughing
and wearing next to nothing,
Gotta get that next to mine.

I fill my glass like I filled up the last,
I know my life is slippin slowlydown the tube,
Soon Im smilin and swayin in the breeze
Of an old familiar tune.

Monday morning, though Ive sworn it all off
I find myself at the liquor store,
Just a few to round it all out,
Soon Im back for more.

Six beers and a pack of smokes later
and Im back on the phone,
Callin friends all around the world
Cause I dont wanna drink alone.

 RAISE YOUR GLASS TO ME
CAUSE ILL BE QUITTIN SOON
TIL THEN,
 I GOT LITTLE LIVIN LEFT TO DO---Lyrics submitted by Abraham.
