Why can't I be in every window every where in the world ?
Looking out at a billion faces, the next one better that this

I will always be trapped inside this mystery
but I will always be the one who sticks around

when you go down

Why can''t I be in every window , everywhere in the world ?
Always bathed in a sea of sunshine every day of the year

I could never be, trapped inside your tragedy
but I will always be the one who sticks around

when you go down

See through me, I'm in your window
Happily, I see it all
Open me, I'm in the arms of a woman who knows
How to give up and let go

I will always be the one who sticks around

when you go down---Lyrics submitted by Abraham.
