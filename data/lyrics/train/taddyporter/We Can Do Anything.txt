I hold her hand while she sleeps
I brush her hair from her cheek
We can do anything while were sleep walking

It feels like it was yesterday
I can feel you breathe and feel you say
We can do anything while sleep walking

And Im lost in your way
Cuz you are so real to me
As Im moving away, I can still see your face while I dream

Even though youre gone
Youre here today
You taught me to dream, I can hear you say
We can do anything while were sleep walking
We can do anything while were sleep walking---Lyrics submitted by Meagan Morrow.
