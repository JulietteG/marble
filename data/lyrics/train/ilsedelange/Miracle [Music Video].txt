Someone put a lock on this old door
It's been beaten up and used and more
It's been kicked a hundred thousand times
Keeping all the memories behind

If you read the lines between the paint
Look beyond the cracks that store away
It's hidden in the windows of the walls
Right behind the eyes that saw it all

Given all the facts of circumstance
I did not believe that a romance
Would show itself in all this dark and blue
That's the only place I ever knew

You put me outside my safety-zone
Outside all the lines that made my home
To find out that no one really lives
Without giving what it is you give

A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle looking in my life, after all
A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle A miracle A miracle

I've been living underneath my skin
Everything I felt I kept it in
It carried all the words without a sound
It got me, it almost got too loud

But now that my arms are holding on
To someone as sacred as a song
To the one who wants to be my own
I have found that blood can come from stone

A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle looking in my life, after all
A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle A miracle A miracle

A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle looking in my life, after all
A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle looking in my life, after all
A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle A miracle A miracle

Someone put a lock on this old door
It's been beaten up and used and more
It's been kicked a hundred thousand times
Keeping all the memories behind---Lyrics submitted by tineke.
