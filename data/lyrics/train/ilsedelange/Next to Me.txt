Forgive me if I seem a little careless
I'm trying, but I'm still so new to this
I'm learning that I need to
Let it, let it, let it be

I'm scared that somehow I will mess it up
That my faith in love will never be enough
But your voice picks me up and
Rescues, rescues, rescues me

And every time I try to see
I am losing sight of what is really there

I just wanna feel like a ship on the ocean
Flying like a bird, floating in the air
We don't need to chase any destination, baby
We can end up anywhere

You can be the anchor that keeps me grounded
You can be my song, and my summer breeze
We don't need to chase any destination, baby
Don't care where we're going
As long as you are next to me

You're strong, it's everything I'm leaning on
Your hands, they keep pulling me along
If you show me, I promise I am
Listening, listen, listening

Feels crazy, but I think we're breaking ground
This love is something we have simply found
Let's put it somewhere we can
Keep it, keep, keep it, keep it safe

'Cause when I'm holding on too tight
I am missing out on what is really there

I just wanna feel like a ship on the ocean
Flying like a bird, floating in the air
We don't need to chase any destination, baby
We can end up anywhere

You can be the anchor that keeps me grounded
You can be my song, and my summer breeze
We don't need to chase any destination, baby
Don't care where we're going
As long as you are next to me

As long as you are next to me

As long as you are next to me

I just wanna feel like a ship on the ocean
Flying like a bird, floating in the air
We don't need to chase any destination, baby
We can end up anywhere

You can be the anchor that keeps me grounded
You can be my song, and my summer breeze
We don't need to chase any destination, baby
Don't care where we're going
As long as you are next to me

As long as you are next to me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
