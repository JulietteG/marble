~Harmonica~

Distance is just miles to other places
Lonesome just a feeling that I'm feeling over you
Blue is just the color of the ocean and the sky
Missin' you's just something the I do.

By the time we get to Menendoza, 
shadows will be making ground this evening, shadows do
Dying day will set fire to the prairie
And I'll be nearly half way home to you.

Leaving's just a reason for returning,
Absence just the time I spent without you by my side
I know I'll be rewarded for the yearning
Cuz sometimes this Ol' world it aint' so wise
By the time we make it to Alberta,
Darkness will be dawn on the valley of the moon,
Twilight will be falling on the Badlands
And I'll be more than half way home to you.

~Harmonica~

Heartache's just a different way of thinkin',
Time's just for killin' till I'm lookin' into your eyes,
So desert aint' know nothin' but the drinking
To help to calm the demons in the night

By the time we see the Rocky Mountains,
the sundown will be turning all the peaks crimson hue,
The sky will fade to black behind the ranges,
And know that I'll be waking up with you

Well I know that I'll be waking next to you...
Know that I'll be wakin' next to you.
