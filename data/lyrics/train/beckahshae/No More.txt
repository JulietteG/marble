Get behind me Im coming through
Im armed and dangerous
Im like an army thats fed up with you
commanding you must
get out my way and go back
to where you came from
Oh! Go! Im telling you, no more!

Im sick and tired of all youre lies
nothing you say could make me
Agree with you, I know the truth
nothing you do could break me
You just dont know who your messing with
Im a warrior

Oh! Go! Im telling you, no more!
The weapons of my warfare
they are not carnal

Oh! Go! Im telling you, no more!
The weapons of my warfare
they are not carnal

The victory is mine
Im taking back everything at least seven times
I raise my sword and make you wish
you never even tried
Im telling you, No More!

All your attempts are only making me stronger
Your strategy aint fooling me any longer
I see you loud and clear
You cant hide, but you can run
Oh! Go! Im telling you, no more!

You best be leaving now
cause Im about to bring some glory
You lose, and thanks again
for giving me an awesome story
You just dont know who youre messing with
Im a warrior
Oh! No! Im telling you no more!

Oh! Go! Im telling you, no more!
The weapons of my warfare
they are not carnal

Oh! Go! Im telling you, no more!
The weapons of my warfare
they are not carnal

The victory is mine
Im taking back everything at least seven times
I raise my sword and make you wish
you never even tried
Im telling you, No More

Im not afraid cause Im not alone
so be on your way
Theres nothing here for you
the battles already won
You aint worth my time
I aint messing with you no more
Youve been defeated under my feet
crushed on the floor
You aint done nothing
but make me a better warrior!
So Im telling you, no more!

The victory is mine
Im taking back everything at least seven times
I raise my sword and make you wish
you never even tried
Im telling you, No More!

The victory is mine
Im taking back everything at least seven times
I raise my sword and make you wish
you never even tried
Im telling you, No More!---Lyrics submitted by Brooke Arceneaux.
