All to You, I surrender
All to You, I freely give
I will ever love and trust You
In Your presence daily live
All to You, I surrender
All to You, I freely give

I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender
I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender
I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender
I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender

Im giving up but not giving in
Fought long enough
I dont need to win
Oh so broken

Finally I give all control
Here at your feet Im letting go
Oh so broken
You gave your life for me to know, you always
All that I have, is my confidence in your grace

I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender
I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender
I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender
I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender

No matter how strange, it looks to them
No matter the cost, or how painful it gets
Im drawing my battle line in the sand
Marching forward, determined to give you all I can

In You I declare victory
Since Ive let go of my own will
Now freedom and liberty, reign in me

I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender
I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender
I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender
I Surrender, I Surrender, I-I Surrender

All to You, I surrender
All to You, I freely give
I will ever love and trust You
In Your presence daily live
All to You, I surrender
All to You, I freely give---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
