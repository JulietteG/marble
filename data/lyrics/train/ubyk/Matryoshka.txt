Promises broken & splitting in half
all that I want, is something I had
fell to the bottom
when you cry, it's alright, it's alright

reach out for nothing,
but nothing is there
slips through your fingers
and into thin Air
time at the bottom
when your down
It's alright, It's alright

and for a while
I soar above all the clouds
I'm going up, I'll see you
on the way down
don't be too long
I'm floating up folding time
trying to keep up with the sun
don't wake me

tiny red petals
and big gaping eyes
trying to hold on but there's too many sides
solid inside her
when you lie
it's alright it's alright

and for a while
I soar above all the clouds
I'm going up, I'll see you
on the way down
don't be too long
I'm floating up folding time
trying to keep up with the sun
don't wake me
floating up foding time
higher and higher
floating up higher and higher and..
floating up higher and higher and..
floating up higher and higher and..
floating up higher and higher and..---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
