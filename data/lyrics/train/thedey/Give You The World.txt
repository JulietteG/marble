I'm a give u the world
Give u the world

Through the fire through the rain
Through the joy and the pain
It damn all remains the same
I'm a give u the world
Through the fights through the change
Through the nights through the days
Este Amor will remains the same
I'm a give u the world

I'm a give u the world maa
And everything in it
For the nights that u wanted to leave
And u did it
U stood on your
And these women
Would give their lives to sit where u sat
The best in the best
Damn or they have these
Is that right for me
When they say they love me
I know they're lying to me
In your spots where they try to be
I think I found u finally
She said she wants to
Make a little baby devine for me
She understands where I'm trying to be
She was right here
Before?
I'm a mic rhyme u see
Smoke the finest street
So give me my space and privacy
And I'm honestly try to get for the world
Rap the globe in a bow
Like here u go girl

Through the fire through the rain
Through the joy and the pain
It damn all remains the same
I'm a give u the world
Through the fights through the change
Through the nights through the days
Este Amor Will remains the same
I'm a give u the world

I'll pick u up when u fall
I'm at your side when u call
U just gotta know
That I love u baby boy
And just wanna give u the world

Through the fire and the rain
Through the ups and the downs
You've been always right there
Holding me down

Through the fire through the rain
Through the joy and the pain
It damn all remains the same
I'm a give u the world
Through the fights through the change
Through the nights through the days
It damn all remains the same
I'm a give u the world

Everytime u hold me down boy
I hold u down boy
Another skip town boy
I'll be around boy
U can't count on me
I'm a follow through

I'm a be the truth
Yes see
U ain't ever got nothing to worry about
If u burn by the fire I'm a carry around
Just holla when u need me around
Cause I got u like u got me
And forever baby holding u down---Lyrics submitted by joyce.
