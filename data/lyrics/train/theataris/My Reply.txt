I got your letter and the poetry that you sent me 
Postmarked in December of last year 
I really hope you're doing better 
All of your friends close by your side 
One step closer to recovery 

I wish there was something I could say 
To erase each and every page that you've been through 
Even though it's not my place to save you 
I appreciate but can't accept this 
Thank-you note that's sealed with your last breath 
I won't stand aside and listen to you give up 

If you just hold on for one more second 
Just hold on to what you have 
If you'll just hold on, just hold on 
You will wake up tomorrow 

These arms remained stretched out to you 
Maybe someday you'll accept them 
Or maybe it's too late to save 
A young girl's heart that's long stopped beating 

Wake up, wake up you've gotta believe 
Wake up, wake up you can't give up 
Time keeps going on without us 
Long after we're dead and gone---Lyrics submitted by ayn.
