I must be honest wit you baby ( i just gotta be honest baby)
I love to watch the faces that you make (when we make love ooooooo)
But when i'm behind you holding your hips
And you close your eyes and bite your lip (i can't see you)
So might I suggest a change
Little mama please dont think me strange for what i'm bout to say to you (please dont think me strange)
If you know anthing about me by now you know i'm a freak 
Just follow my lead

Baby i love makin love in front of the mirror (front of the mirror)
So that i can watch you enjoying me (baby tonight)
Baby tonight lets try in front of the mirror (front of the mirror)
Watching ourselves make love girl why dont we

Little mama keep yo chin up please watch me do the (nasty)
I like it when u make it move fast mommy
If i pull yo head back cause i want you to see that we look so good together
I understand that your not ready for me to make my directorial debute (staring you baby)
That's okay with me with me honestly this is the next best thing baby

Baby i love makin love in front of the mirror (front of the mirror)
So that i can watch you enjoying me (baby tonight)
Baby tonight lest try in front of the mirror (front of the mirror)
Watching ourselves make love girl why dont we (why don't we baby)

I see you can you see me watchin you lovin it
I see you can you se me watchin you lovin it
I see you can you see me watchin you lovin it
I see you can u see my watchin you lovin it
I see you can u see me watchin you lovin it
I see you can you see me wachin you lovin it 
I see you can you see me watchin you lovin it
I see you can you see me watchin you lovin it

Baby i love makin love in front of the mirror 
So that i can watch you enjoying me 
Baby tonight lest try in front of the mirror 
Watching ourselves make love girl why dont we 

Can we make love in front of the mirror baby---Lyrics submitted by kel.
