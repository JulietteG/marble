She's a ballerina
Discipline so superb
Blessed with swan leg grace
Curse with Houston curves
The teachers hate her features
Beat her down with words
Saying there's somewhere else she should be dancing with a body like hers
Shawty been lead astray
Considering what they say

No matter what they try to tell ya
Know that you are not lost
When they question your direction
Know that you are not lost
Don't you let nobody tear you away (tear you away)
Don't you let nobody tear you away (tear you away)

She's a ballerina
Through and through
Nothing can contest
Though she's incredible she don't get paid for it yet
Student loans to keep the lights on
She breaks her neck
Thinking about stripping but she don't won't her teachers to be right
She don't want regrets
But shawty got bills to pay
But she don't wanna do it that way

No matter what they try to tell ya
Know that you are not lost
Though they question your direction
Know that you are not lost
Don't you let nobody tear you away (tear you away)
Don't you let nobody tear you away (tear you away)

Most people only thinking about the destination
Never giving any thought to the road
We all want the same thing but we all not the same
All we know is no one really knows
Who's to say was the wrong way to go

No matter what they try to tell ya
Know that you are not lost
Though they question your direction
Know that you are not lost
Don't you let nobody tear you away (tear you away)
Don't you let nobody tear you away (tear you away)---
