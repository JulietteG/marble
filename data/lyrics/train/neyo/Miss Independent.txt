Yeaaaaahh 

Ooh
It's something about
Just something about
The way she moved
I can't figure it out
There's something
About her
(About her)
Say ooh
There's something
About kinda women
That want you
But don't need you
Hey
I can't figure it out
There's something
About her
Cuz she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicured nails
Just sent
The pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
Cuz she move like a boss
Do what a boss
Do
She got me thinking
About getting involved
That's the kinda girl
I need

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Won't you come
And spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Ooh
The way you shine
Miss independent

Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeahhh, mmm
Ooh
There's something
About kinda woman
That can do
It for herself
I look at her
And it makes me proud
There's something
About her
There something
Ooh
So sexy
About the kinda women
That don't even
Need my help
She says she got it
She got it
No doubt
There's something
About her
Cuz she work
Like the boss
Play like a boss
Car and a crib
She about
To pay em both off
And her bills
Are paid on time
She made for a boss
Soley a boss
Anything less
She's telling em
To get lost
That's the girl
Thats on my mind

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Won't you come
And spend
A little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss independent
Ooh

And spend a little time
