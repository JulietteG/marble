Hmm
I remember, sweet smells in the afternoon yeah
Hmm vanilla candles in your bedroom, yeah
I remember slow jams on my itunes
You take a sip you take a puff yeah you'll regret it soon
I remember like it was yesterday
How we used to lay around letting time and the world just fade away
And after all this time to see you now is great
I hesitate but I wanna say come over, come over

You're still so fine
Can we make up for lost time?
Girl I want you to come over, come over
Girl how you been?
Can we pretend we're still in love again?

Do you still like to wear Chanel baby?
I think about you every time I smell that smell oh
Hey and now you and you're man doing well
How did I know that you got a man?
I saw the pictures on your Instagram
With all do respect girl
OOh I'm just saying you can do better
My bad just trying to make you laugh
To take my mind away from how much I wanna ask you to come over, come over

You're still so fine
Can we make up for lost time?
Girl I want you to come over, come over
Girl how you been?
(How you been?)
Can we pretend that we're still in love again?
Oh baby can we run it back?
Can we go back in time?
Back to when I was yours and you were mine
Can we go back to when love was simple and it was just us?
Back to when we were in love

Come over, come over
You're still so fine
Can we make up for lost time?
Can you come over, come over?
Girl how you been?
(Girl how you been?)
Can we pretend we're still in love again?---
