(feat. Jeezy)

You lookin' better than a Scarface starter kit 
All hundreds, small faces nothin counterfeit 
You want this ghetto D? Or that over the counter shit? 
Catch you strippin in the kitchen, on the counter shit (damn) 
Oh shit (sup), I guess Ill pause for these bitches 
Guess Ill ball for these niggas, swear this my last three swishers 
On my grown man shit Im bout to kill this bitches 

Baby you know I got some money 
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me 
But when I look in your eyes 
Baby you got everything money just cant buy 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 

Got a diamond in the back, sunroof top 
Got a diamond on my hat and my sunroof off 
Her mind strong but her body so soft 
Tattoo on her hip read Only for a Boss 
She aint impressed with the way I ball 
She said You seen one ghost, you seen em all 
Even though that thing cold 
She said A Rolls Royce, youre a Civic, Daddy Imma roll with you 
She ride for me, die for me, love me, thats how she do 
I pulled up close and I tell her whats true 

Baby you know I got some money 
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me 
But when I look in your eyes 
Baby you got everything money just cant buy 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 

Shawty where you at? Meet me at the mall 
Told her Let me buy you something, she replied Naw 
She said her love wont be bought 
I dont need to spend some no money, spend some time thats all 
I told her Daddy dont mind spending 
I want to see you shine like the diamonds in my pendant 
She told me she dont care for the flash 
Want affection not cash, girl I aint even mad at you 
She ride for me, die for me, love me, thats how she do 
I pulled up close and I tell her whats true 

Baby you know I got some money 
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me 
But when I look in your eyes 
Baby you got everything money just cant buy 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 

Whats happening with it baby? Hope you dont think that Im crazy 
Say me and you, get us some practice makin' a baby 
I will take some out the stash and buy you that new Mercedes 
Then be all up in that ass in the back of that new Mercedes 
You call for the protectin', yeah, send me your issues 
They aint bout to be playing with her, me and these pistols 
See that thirty-six for DUsse, Im the provider 
Come scoop me in that 458, you be the rider 
(Yeah) Oh well, thats that, back to the party 
Bet you niggas anything Im leaving here with shawty 
Got a feeling that she fuckin with me for me 
She got me feeling like I got a million on me 

Baby you know I got some money 
Girl, the dough ain't a problem for me 
But when I look in your eyes 
Baby you got everything money just cant buy 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy) 
(All the things money cant buy)---
