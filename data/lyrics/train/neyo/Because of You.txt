Want to, but I cant help it
I love the way it feels,
Its got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I dont
Tell myself Ill stop everyday, knowin that I won't

I got a problem and I dont know what to do about it
Even if I did, I dont know if I would quit but I doubt it
Im taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, Im so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

And its all because of you [3X]
And its all because
Never get enough,
Shes the sweetest drug

Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done,
Only concern is the next time, Im gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession wont let me leave

I got a problem and I dont know what to do about it
Even if I did, I dont know if I would quit but I doubt it
Im taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, Im so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

And its all because of you (all because of you) [3X]
And its all because
Never get enough,
Shes the sweetest drug

Aint no doubt, so strung out [2X]
Over you, over you, over you

Because of you,
And its all because of you,
Never get enough
Shes the sweetest drug, shes the sweetest drug---
