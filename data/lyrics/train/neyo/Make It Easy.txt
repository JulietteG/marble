Do you love me for me though?
The real me not my fly alter-ego
I know I'm never not fly
But if I ever was would you still ride?

If it's early in the morning and my breath stink
Would you still roll over kissin' on me like it ain't?
If I didn't have millions in the bank
I'm talkin' cardboard box and a fish tank
Better yet a fish bowl
And if the fame got old
If the cameras didn't flash when I walk through
If I wasn't makin' them bands when I walk through
Is it where I lost you? Or is you holding me down?
You never let 'em bring me down
All the haters in the world right now
Would you add to the stress or would you make it easy

For me to take it easy
That's what I'm lookin' for, baby let me know
Would you make it easy?
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)
Easy to take it easy
That's what I'm looking for, baby let me know

Ooh girl I know what I need
Sex appeal, intelligence, positive energy
When the drama comes, she become serenity
Lady when I need a lady
Freak when I need a freak
Shawty ride like me like I ride the beat
Everything 'bout her quality
Why I send her and her girls to Dubai
For 'bout a week
Just a little reward for, for when she hold me down
Never let 'em bring me down
All the haters in the world right now
You the one that I'm lookin' for to make it easy

For me to take it easy
That's what I'm lookin' for, baby let me know
Would you make it easy?
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)
Easy to take it easy
That's what I'm looking for, baby let me know

Where you at?
Shawty where you at?
Baby girl we got bags to pack
We got trips to take if you cool with that
Show me that you got my back
Let me see that you got my back
Then we'll get into all that
Said we'll get into all that
If you make it easy

For me to take it easy
That's what I'm lookin' for, baby let me know
Would you make it easy?
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)
Easy to take it easy
That's what I'm looking for, baby let me know---
