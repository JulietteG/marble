I hear something out there callin' my name.
No matter where I turn it all looks the same.
I never sleep at night, I just stay up and wait.
But the burning in my blood never came.

Will I know it?
Will I know it?
Will I know it when I see it?
Will I know it?
Will I know it?
Will I know it when you're here?

I need you now, I need you more than ever before, before.
I need you now, I need you more than ever before, before.

I know the man I am is not who I should be.
The Devil take my hand says, "Child come with me."
My body shivers and aches. I can't break free.
Why do the things I hate come so naturally?

Will I know it?
Will I know it?
Will I know it when I see it?
Will I know it?
Will I know it?
Will I know it when you're here?

I need you now, I need you more than ever before, before.
I need you now, I need you more than ever before, before.
I need you now, I need you more than ever before, before.
I need you now, I need you more than ever before.

When we see the light when we're going home.
We'll dance on our graves with our bodies below.
We'll sing glory and Hallelujah.---Lyrics submitted by Jacie.
