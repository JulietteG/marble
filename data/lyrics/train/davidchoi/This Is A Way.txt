I got a cold
And you got one too
My silly heart says you're a fool

Go take care of her
She's all that you've got
All that you've wanted
And all that you're not

I'll leave my head for thinking
This job's for a heart that's beating

I don't care if I'm down
I don't care how I feel
I love you so much
That I'll always be here

Don't worry about me
I'll take care of you
This is a way to say that I love you

You tell me I'm sick
With a giggle and stare
I hope that you know
That I really care

You get out of bed
You're so messy and sweet
A kiss on my cheek

I'll leave my head for thinking
This job's for a heart that's beating

I don't care if I'm down
I don't care how I feel
I love you so much
That I'll always be here

Don't worry about me
I'll take care of you
This is a way to say that I love you

To say that I love you

Not only today
But forever more
Until I die
Or you just get bored

I'll give you my all
Everything I've got
Because of this heart

I'll leave my head for thinking
This job's for a heart that's beating

I don't care if I'm down
I don't care how I feel
I love you so much
That I'll always be here

Don't worry about me
I'll take care of you
This is a way to say that I love you

To say that I love you
To say that I lo- lo- lo- love you
To say that I lo- lo- ohh love you---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
