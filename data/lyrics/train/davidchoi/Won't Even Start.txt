1st stanza: 
What happened, after last summer?
When we broke up, in September.
I havent seen you, feels like a long time. 
Sometimes it still hurts.
But I always get by.
Still got a piece of you, under my skin.
Its always there no matter where Ive been.
Chorus:
So if I ever see you on the street.
Ill pretend that I didnt see.
And turn my face, no use in small talk anyways.
Coz if I look into your eyes, then Ill have to say goodbye.
And thatll break my heart.
So I wont even start.
No, I wont even start.

2nd stanza:
I wish you love, and I wish it true. 
That s the best I can, do for you.
Coz youll probably find love, in someone new.
I have to let go, yeah its hard to do. 
So if I run into you, and youre on by his side.
Just know itll cut me like a knife.
Repeat Chorus
Ill be ok 
Ill be ok 
Oh thats what Ill say
