You make me burning, yes I'm burning away

I know you're not afraid of the truth girl
I know you want them for show what to do

So that's why I'm singing to you (3x)
Baby we can do it, we can do it all night
Put your body right into it and we do it alright,
People singing, people dance until the sunlight
And we gonna do it all night

Baby we can do it, we can do it all night
Put your body right into it and we do it alright,
