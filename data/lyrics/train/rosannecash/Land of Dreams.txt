I heard you calling from the start
A river runs through both our hearts
A thousand shades of something new
I cannot wait to play for you

So play your songs and make them real
Theres a place for all we feel
And its closer than it seems
Come and find your land of dreams

Land of dreams, land of dreams
Come and find your land of dreams
And its closer than it seems
Come and find your land of dreams

The world is smaller in our eyes
The city streets and moonlit skies
The shining waves and evergreens
I will give you everything

Well you can hear the bells and strings
Just wait until you make them ring
And its closer than it seems
Come and find your land of dreams---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
