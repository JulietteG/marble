Woahhh x4

Sweating out another tantrum
Reads the book of poetry
Words believed in the anthology
You all need to calm down

I can see it that you want to be with me
Yes I can see it that you want to be with

Enter the world of society
Girls that make you go weak at the knees
The fun starts on the balcony
The perfect girl from the bond film

Yes I can see it that you want to be with me
I can see it that you want to be with me

Woahhh x4

I can see it that you want to be with me x2
I'm indecisive but you keep looking at me
I'm indecisive but you keep looking, looking, looking---Lyrics submitted by Elise.
