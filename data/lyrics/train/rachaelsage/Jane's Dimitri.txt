The moment that she realized
She'd already had the love of her life
It was fifty years, five minutes too late.
He followed her halfway across the earth,
He followed her far from his Russian birth,
He followed her like he was Tarzan and she was Jane.

The moon belongs to no one
He promised it was hers.
She was sixteen on a class trip
Clutching freedom like a purse.
And they met one night in Moscow
He had chips upon both shoulders
Like a baby Johnny Rotten
Hypnotizing as a scream.

What is Jane supposed to say?
What is Jane supposed to do?
As she finally recognizes
What's always been more than true?
What is Jane supposed to feel,
When she finally hears his voice,
A lack of days between the truth
leaving her no other choice?

Oh Jane's Dimitri.

When he showed up at her doorstep
She was shipwrecked and confused.
Disbelief is a defensive
Like a round of "I love you's."
No one teaches girls to stand up
To their parents or their fears.
No one preaches to the elders
To bow down to teenage years.

What is Jane supposed to say?
What is Jane supposed to do?
As she finally recognizes
What's always been more than true?

Will they lock her up in madness?
Will they throw away the key?
She has seen his face in strangers,
Made sweet love with enemies, 
Doesn't matter but she's wandered
Like a gypsy dandelion in the air
Kissing demons with the desperateness
Of Judas in despair.

Oh Jane's Dimitri.

Her regret is like arthritis
Gripping wisdom by the joint
And you're gasping and you're drowning
While love's sharpening her point
Sixty five and still a virgin
To no wistfulness of risk
She stopped crying after twelve months
She stopped writing after six.

What is Jane?
What is Jane?
When she finally recognizes
What's always been in her way,
What is Jane supposed to feel
When she finally hears his voice?
Like the days between the Sabbath
Leaving her no other choice,
Doesn't matter that she's wandered
Like a gypsy dandelion in the air,
Kissing demons With the desperateness 
Of Judas and despair.

Oh Jane's Dimitri.---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
