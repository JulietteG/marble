You never doubted it,
You're so proud of it,
You straight shouted it, 
There's no doubt of it,
You couldn't care less,
You love goodness,
You think it's endless, endless, endless,
You think it's gotta diss,
It doesn't bother us,
No, nobody know never knew about it,
And in the spotlight,
You get to sit tight,
You wanna hit that, ahh, ahh, 

Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah, [x6]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ah-ah,
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah,

You need to know how,
To say you'll backtrack,
Between the clear bag,
Somewhere in your habitat,
You have a little thing,
You think you're bothering,
The class is ending, ending, ending,
You never did know,
You don't wanna know,
There's another show playing in your window,
The perm'nent thought of you,
Has never bothered you,
You're gonna have to, have to, have to,

Set, set that crown on the ground and-ah, [x6]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ah-ah,
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah,---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
