It was a Wednesday
I got the kool-aid
I hear my diction
Talking to my baby
I wanna feel the ocean
Put on my sunset lotion
I see the sun glow
Water flow in slow motion
I got a beach chair
I see the blonde hair
Pick up my feet there
I feel the cool air
The breeze is nice now
I'll tell you right now
I sip my kool-aid
I'm feeling better now

Do I need any vacation?
Just need to get away for a while
Wait, did I forget my sunglasses?
No
Got 'em

I paint my nails pink
There in the sand dome
I hear the oh-so calling on the radio
I see a young boy
He on the upswing
He gets a nose bleed
And I hear the girls sing
I hop on the water slide
Gotta get my swims on
I pull my straps up
I'll see your better slides
Oh no no no no no no no no

Talking about boys
Put the music on
I'll just start dancin' ---Lyrics submitted by Zachary Evergreen.
