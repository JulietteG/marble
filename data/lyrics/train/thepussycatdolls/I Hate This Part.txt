were driving slow through the snow
on fifth avenue
and right now
radio's all that we can hear

man we ain't talked since we left
its over due
its cold out side
but between us 
it worse in here

the world slows down but my heart beats faster now
i know this part were the end starts

i cant take it any longer
thought that we were stronger
all we do is linger 
slipping through our fingers
i don;t wanna try now 
all thats left goodbye to
find a way that i can tell you
i hate this part right here
i hate this part right here
i just cant take your tears
 i hate this part right here

every seven takes the same old scene
seems were bound by the laws of the same routine
got to talk to you now fore we go to sleep 
but will we sleep once i tell you whats hurting me

The world slows down but my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't want to try now
All that's left is goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing is wrong
But there is no more time for lies
Cause I see sun set in your eyes

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't want to try now
All that's left is goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you

But I gotta do this
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part

I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take these tears
I hate this part right here---Lyrics submitted by dani-elle.
