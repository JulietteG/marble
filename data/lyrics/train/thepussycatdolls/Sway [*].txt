When the rhumba rhythm starts to play 
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me 
Stay with me, sway with me 
Other dancers maybe on the floor
But my eyes will only see you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak 
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins 
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Sway me, take me
Thrill me, hold me
Bend me, ease me
You have a way with me
Sway(sway)
(Instrumental)
Other dancers maybe on the floor
But my eyes will only see you
Only you have a technique 
When we sway i go weak 
I go weak
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Sway me
Sway me 
Sway me now---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
