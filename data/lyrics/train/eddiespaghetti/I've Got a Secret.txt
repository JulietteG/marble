Who's gonna be the one that gets to know you
Who's gonna be the one that gets inside
who's gonna be the one that has to show you
all of the things of which you've been denied

I got a secret
I'm gonna tell the whole world
Can you hear me
Are you listening my girl?
I got a secret
I'm gonna tell the whole world

I'm gonna be the one who has to hold you
I'm gonna take you for a little ride
I'm gonna be the guy who needs to scold you
I'm gonna be the one who's in your eye

I got a secret
I'm gonna tell the whole world
Can you hear me
Are you listening my girl?
I got a secret
I'm gonna tell the whole world

I got a secret
I'm gonna tell the whole world
Can you hear me
Are you listening my girl?
I got a secret
I'm gonna tell the whole world

I got a secret
I'm gonna tell the whole world
I got a secret
I'm gonna tell the whole world
I got a secret
I'm gonna tell the whole world---Lyrics submitted by Emilia Keskinen.
