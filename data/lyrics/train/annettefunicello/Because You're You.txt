Verse 1:
Every time you hold me
I know its real
My heart once told me
How it would feel 

Refrain 1:
Why?
Just like you told me
Why?
Each time you hold me
Why?
Because youre you

Verse 2:
Every time Im near you
Stars from the skies
Somehow appear to
Shine in your eyes

Refrain 2:
Why?
They just appear to
Why?
Each time Im near you
Because youre you

Verse 3:
Every time we kiss now
Its plain to see
Im sure of this now
Youre meant for me

Refrain 3:
Why?
So sure of this now
Why?
Each time we kiss now
Why?
Because youre you
Because youre you
Because youre you---Lyrics submitted by Nat Sanders.
