Youve fall over our lies
rising from hell
and scaping from heaven
wide open to me
your arms rounded this dream
an now it lives in your flesh

Hold us, with litte loving hands
feed our winds, with your life breath
save my hopes, feed my heart
be by my side and never, never shut your voice

Blessed are your summer flights
blessed are your winter scars
i want to see you, scape from lonelyness
your tired steps, your giants wark

I want you beside me
upon my dreams
you smiles in my winds
              Beside me
              Beside me

I want you beside me
upon my dreams
you smiles in my winds
              Beside me
              Beside me


Blessed are your summer flights
blessed are your winter scars
i want to see you, scape from lonelyness
your tired steps, your giants wark


I want you beside me
upon my dreams
you smiles in my winds                                     
              Beside me
              Beside me---Lyrics submitted by SeNTeNciA.
