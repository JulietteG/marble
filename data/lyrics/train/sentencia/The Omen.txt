The one whos on the cross
Such holly as you are
Such weak as you have been
We are so big too
Their children are crying in blood
From which new demons will born
Hes looking but nothing can ends
All we bastards will rise again

Evil eyes is the only I see
Rotten flesh in every sin
Dead bodys twist around us
I see no sun in this awake
Theres no father in this woods
No escape from a dark fate
This chaos is ours now
The omen has began

Take my hand
Feel my scars
I got no hopes
Our savior is gone---Lyrics submitted by SeNTeNciA.
