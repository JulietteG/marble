I rise my soul to the sky
waiting to understand why
i know youll never go away
its hard but i have to say

Photos and memories are helping me through
every moment that i lived with you
you are a piece of me
and you will live through me

you'll live through me
ill go on with my life for you
your soul has been released
but i know youll never go away

your soul has been released
I`m trying to understand
The only thing I have to say
That it will never be the same

how can i erase that day?
That words that you said
Will help me through life
And will give me strength

you'll live through me
ill go on with my life for you
your soul has been released
but i know youll never go away
In that single moment
Our lives changed forever
you have gone to a better place
but you will stay with us forever

one life has gone away.
but so many are better.
thanks to you my friend.
this are my words to you.---Lyrics submitted by SeNTeNciA.
