Why we stand in our dreams?
is this life what it seems?
we are so tired of fighting
im sick of all these goodbyes

in this endless nightmare
we are like prisioners
running and running
what are we afraid of?

Running and running
what are we afraid of?

its a farewell.... 
my soul is fading away
and my body still cold
but my heart is like a flame


give me one good reason
why we still fighting
for these broken dreams
my soul falls apart

this roads have no end
i am tired of walk alone
give me your soul
and walk with me

Running and running
what are we afraid of?

its a farewell....  
my soul is fading away                                                                 
and my body still cold
but my heart is like a flame---Lyrics submitted by SeNTeNciA.
