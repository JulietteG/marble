When you are set to throw in your hand
When you are far from home 
When what you believe is buried in your hands
When you feel outgrown

Ill be the one to pick you up again
When you decide youve had enough of it 
Ill be the one
Ill be the one 

When your speech is slowed
when your eyes are closed
when you feel betrayed 
when your heart is frayed 
when your feet are cold 
when your sights are low

Ill be the one to pick you up again 
When you decide youve had enough of it 
ILl be the one 
ill be the one---Lyrics submitted by Molly.
