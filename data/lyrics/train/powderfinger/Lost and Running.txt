Oh, I was sick and tired of waiting lost
And you were mad at me for so much more.
I was bored listening to the same old chords,
You would complain that i was never around.
And we shouldn't hope,
No, we shouldn't hope.

If love is so easy then why am I stuck?
If life is so smoothe, why can't I get enough?

Oh, I'm still lost and running
I can't get enough. 
No, I'm still lost and running
I can't get enough.

Oh, everyday moves like a hurricane
It's dragging me around no matter what I say.
Night time in the city streets, I'm outta luck
The cobblestones are dark and wet, theres no-one I trust
And it comes around,
Yeah, it comes around.

Mr So-Easy say, where have you gone?
Im looking for somwhere that I can lay down my arms.

Oh, I'm still lost and running
I can't get enough.
No, I'm still lost and running
I can't get enough.
No, I'm still lost and running,
Somwhere I lay down my arms.
Oh, I'm still lost and running
I can't get enough.
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

I'm taking my time I'll let it float away,
Spare me no lies and you got nothing to say.
The further we slip into this rabbit hole,
The harder we look for a new place to go.

Oh, I'm still lost and running
I can't get enough.
No, I'm still lost and running
I can't get enough.
No, I'm still lost and running
Somewhere I lay down my arms.
Oh, I'm still lost and running
I can't get enough.---Lyrics submitted by Scott.
