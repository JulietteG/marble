Josie's on a vacation far away

Come around and talk it over.
So many things that I want to say

You know I like my girls a little bit older.
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight.

I ain't got many friends left to talk to

Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble.
You know I'd do anything for you

Stay the night but keep it under cover.
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight.

Try to stop my hands from shaking

But something in my mind's not making sense.
It's been a while since we were all alone

But I can't hide the way I'm feeling.

As you're leaving please would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told you.
Just 'cause you're right that don't mean I'm wrong

Another shoulder to cry upon.
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight.

I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight.
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight.
Use your love, lose your love, your love!---Lyrics submitted by J Smith.
