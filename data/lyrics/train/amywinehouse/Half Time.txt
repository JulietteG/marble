Simple, sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
When the beat kicks in 
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I cant help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you wont get the chance
Half time, time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time, time to think it through 
Consider the change

Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
Cause the music is a gift
And its stronger than all else
Provides me with a bliss

Half time, time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time, time to think it through
Consider the change

My lyrics reveling
Some natural vide
Its a kind of laid back feeling
Just does it right
Every phrase Sinatra sings
Its too much to say, yeah
So I sing this standard sheet 
It pacifies my ache

Half time, time to think it through
Consider the change
Sing it from a different view
Half time, time to think it through
Consider the change---Lyrics submitted by Nichele Jelks.
