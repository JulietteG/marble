Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lovers heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to, my lovers heart for me

I dont want to bother you but im in distress
Theres danger of me losing all my happiness
For I love a man who doesnt no I exist
And cupid, yes you can fix

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lovers heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to, my lovers heart for me

Now cupid if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I swear Im gonna love him till eternity
I no that between the two of us is how we can stay
Cupid, help me, help me help u out

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lovers heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry and let your arrow fly
Straight to, my lovers heart for me---Lyrics submitted by Jodene.
