Well, a Cherokee chief as he dances along
He does an Indian boogie to a white man's song
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
A well a hey ho a lina, wup wup a witten a yeah

Well, he dances over here and he dances over there
And he keeps on a dancin' everywhere
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
A well a hey ho a lina, wup wup a witten a yeah

Well, he dances on the hill and he dances on the rock
But he keep on shakin' that tomahawk
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
A well a hey ho a lina, wup wup a witten a yeah

Well, he sings to the hills and he sings to the clouds
And he keep on singin' so big and proud
A now hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
A well a hey ho a lina, wup wup a witten a yeah

He's a Cherokee cheif as a you might know
And he keeps on sittin' nuven-yo
A now hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
A well a hey ho a lina, wup wup a witten a yeah

Well, a Cherokee chief as he dances along
He does an Indian boggie to a white man's song
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
A well a hey ho a lina, wup wup a witten a yeah---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
