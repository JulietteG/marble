Save me set me free
You dont know what youre doing to me 
Why cant you see it? 
Im not hiding anything
Its written all over me

I been waiting patiently
This isnt how I want it to be
So why you acting like a player 
I dont like games
Its time that you get closer to me

Cause we got to show pain the door
And I never leave this club alone x3

True love cant take the heat 
Im dying for our eyes to meet
I wanna lay down like a page in your diary
So you can lay your feelings on me

We got to show pain the door
And I never leave this club alone x3

Want all of the bad things to stay outside
The dance floor is only for the good times
All of my demons can leave this club alone 

When music is magic I disappear 
Memories vanish like you were never here
The devils and demons can leave this club alone

Cause we got to show pain the door 
And I never leave this club alone x3

You could be my wavelength 
My frequency 
Dont you want to tune it with me?
Our bodies have a future a destiny 
All you got to do is believe 

Cause we got to show pain the door 
And I never leave this love alone x3---Lyrics submitted by Charlie Carter.
