I miss you
I want you
I need you
To hold me
I can't take
The distance
Come closer
No resistance
I need you now, baby listen
You're the puzzle piece that I'm missing
I would do things that have never been done
To get you close to me

Why can't you see?
Why can't you see
That you should be close to me?

Close to me
You should be close to me
I would do things that have never been done
To get you close to me

You make me
So naked
My heart pumps
Anticipating
I fall from
The sky down
If you don't come right now

Close to me
You should be close to me
I would do things that have never been done
To get you close to me

I need you now, baby listen
You're the puzzle piece that I'm missing
I would do things that have never been done
To get you close to me

Close to me
You should be close to me
I would do things that have never been done
To get you
To get you
Close to me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
