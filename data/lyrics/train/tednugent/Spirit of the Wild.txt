Spirit of the Wild
Toby was alive & feelin` free
Cutting loose to see what he could see
Searchin` for a friend to share my time
Lookin` for a mountain I can climb
I aint afraid of death or no voodoo
Do the best that I can do

With the spirit of the wild running free
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me

Angry at the state of world affairs
Angry at the fools that just dont care
Excuses guaranteed to go nowhere
Feeling like a dog thats been abused
I will never, ever lose 

The spirit of the wild inside of me
I got the spirit of the wild running free
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me

(solo)

Wont believe the lie that time will tell
Gonna tell the world to go to......

The spirit of the wild is running free...........
I got the spirit of the wild inside of me........---Lyrics submitted by greg.
