Well I dont know where they come from but they sure do come
I hope they coming for me
And I dont know how they do it but they sure do it good
I hope they doing it for free

They give me Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever

Well the first time that I got it I was just ten years old
I got it from some kitty next door
I went and see the doctor and he gave me the cure
I think I got it some more

They give me Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
I got the Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever

Its nothing dangerous, I feel no pain
I got to ch-ch-change
You know you got it when you going insane
It makes a grown man cry, cry oh wont you make my bed

Well I make the pussy purr with the stroke of my hand
They know they getting it from me
And they know just where to go when they need their lovin man
They know Im doin it for free

I give 'em Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
They got the Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever

Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever
Cat Scratch Fever

Cat Scratch Fever
