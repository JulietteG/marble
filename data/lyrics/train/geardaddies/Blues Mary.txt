First round, fate is grinning
You run straight down the line
The last round, your bladder's giving
You're under the table this time

The first time I saw your sunshine
I knew that you'd always be sad
Your new clothes are wearing thin, girl
I guess I don't feel so bad

CHORUS
It's only blues, Mary
It's only blues, Mary
It's only blues, Mary
For a while don't smile and say that to me

Don't smile and say you're gloomy
Turn your face up towards mine
I'm sure that suburb apartment is roomy
If you choke in the city, that's fine

REPEAT CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
