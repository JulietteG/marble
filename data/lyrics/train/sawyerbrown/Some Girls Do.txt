She turned up her nose as she walked by my Cadillac
From the corner of my eye, I saw you and you laughed
You were sittin' on the swing on your front porch
Paintin' your nails like you were bored
And you yelled she was sure impressed with you

Well, I ain't first class but I ain't white trash
I'm wild and a little crazy too
Some girls don't like boys like me
Aw, but some girls do

I yelled and asked if you would like a ride
When we pulled out of your yard, I bald a tire
You was laughing at me, I was doing James Dean
You was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen
When you rolled your eyes and twirled my pink fur dice

Well, I ain't first class but I ain't white trash
I'm wild and a little crazy too
Some girls don't like boys like me
Aw, but some girls do

Well good ole' boys don't get no breaks
And rich boys think they got what it takes
But there's someone for each of us they say

Well, I ain't first class but I ain't white trash
I'm wild and a little crazy too
Some girls don't like boys like me
Aw, but some girls do

Well, I ain't first class but I ain't white trash
I'm wild and a little crazy too
Some girls don't like boys like me
Aw, but some girls do

I said, some girls do
You know some girls do
Like boys like me
You know some girls do---
