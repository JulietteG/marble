Storming outside, rain
She keeps me home
Quiet conversation makes me warm
So

Summer rain
Whispers me to sleep 
And wakes me up again
Sometimes I swear I hear her call my name
To wash away the pain
My summer rain

In the middle of the night when I'm alone
I feel her kisses on me even when she's gone
Can't wait 'till she gets home

Summer rain
Whispers me to sleep 
And wakes me up again
Sometimes I swear I hear her call my name
To wash away the pain
My summer rain

I don't mind if it rains forever
Let it rain, rain, let it rain
I said I don't mind if it rains forever
Let it rain, rain, let it rain

So go ahead and make it rain
You bring the sunshine back again
So go ahead and make it rain
Your tender touches wash away my rain

Summer rain
Whispers me to sleep 
And wakes me up again
Sometimes I swear I hear her call my name
To wash away the pain
My summer rain

Summer rain
Whispers me to sleep 
And wakes me up again
Sometimes I swear I hear her call my name
To wash away the pain
My summer rain

So go ahead and make it rain
You bring the sunshine back again
So go ahead and make it rain
Your tender touches wash away my rain

So go ahead and make it rain
You bring the sunshine back again
So go ahead and make it rain
Your tender touches wash away my rain

Summer rain
Whispers me to sleep 
And wakes me up again
Sometimes I swear I hear her call my name
To wash away the pain
My summer rain---Lyrics submitted by Sandy.
