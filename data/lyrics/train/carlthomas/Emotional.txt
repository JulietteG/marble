Uh ,oh, oh yeah
Oh ,oh ,oh, oh ,oh yeah
I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, but i was wrong
When i looked into your eyes
I didn't see all the things i used to see
What's going on?

[Faith Evans]
You gave me reason to believe that 
We were always meant to be 
But now i see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me 
With all those baby, baby pleases
No more ,no more

[Faith&Carl;]
Never imagined
You would be a painted picture
I'm emotional
You saw me leaving
No decieving, it's official  
I'm emotional

[Faith Evans]
I can't forget that night i saw you in the 
corner
Wrapped up tight, you were wrong ooh
Slow dancing on the floor
While i was watching from the door
So hurt there you were

You gave me reason to believe that
We were always meant to be
But now i see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me 
With all those baby baby pleases
No more, no more

Never imagined
You would be a painted picture 
I'm emotional
You saw me leaving
No decieving, it's official 
I'm emotional

You had your chance
But you threw it all way
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don'y understand
Why you think that we could stay in total
unhappiness

Repeat Faith&Carl; till end---Lyrics submitted by khadeja.
