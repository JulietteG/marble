Roozi bod, asheghe to bodam
Az daste to kheyli razi bodam
Aman to bad sheitoni kardi
Nazdike man naya to

Boro boro delam toro toro nemikhad
Digeh digeh nemikham bebinamet
Boro boro delam jaye digeh digeh hast
Digeh digeh nemikham bebinamet
(Repeat 2X)

Rozi bood, asheghe to bodam
Az daste, kheyli razi bodam
Aman to bad sheitoni kardi
Delam asan toro digeh nemikhad

Rozi bod, asheghe to bodam
Az daste to kheyli razi bodam
Ama to bad sheitoni kardi
Nazdike man naya to

Boro boro delam toro toro nemikhad
Digeh digeh nemikham bebinamet
Boro boro delam jaye digeh digeh hast
Digeh digeh nemikham bebinamet
(Repeat 4X)

English Translation:

Once, I was in love with you
I was very happy with you
But then you played around
Don't come close to me

Go away, I don't want you anymore
I don't wish to see you anymore
Go away, I love someone else
I don't wish to see you anymore
(Repeat 2X)

Once, I was in love with you
I was very happy with you
But then you played around
I do not desire you anymore

Once, I was in love with you
I was very happy with you
But then you played around
Don't come close to me

Go away, I don't want you anymore
I don't wish to see you anymore
Go away, I love someone else
I don't wish to see you anymore
