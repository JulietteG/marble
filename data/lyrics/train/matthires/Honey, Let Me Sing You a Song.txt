Maybe I'm blind, maybe I'm blind
Oh I couldn't see you shine
And shimmer right in front of my eyes
Front of my eyes, oh no

I thought I saw light, thought I saw light
Oh it was a faded mirror, just a dim reflection
But you shine, you shine so much brighter, oh

CHORUS:
And honey let me sing you a song
And listen to my words as they come out wrong
But don't run away, run away this time
(And) honey let me look in your eyes
You open them one at a time
But don't look away, look away this time

Open your mind, open your mind
And let your beauty flow like wine
But please don't leave me,
Don't leave me outside, leave me outside, oh no

And honey I'll try, honey I'll try 
To hold you like the starry skies
We lay beneath tonight
And you shine, you shine so much brighter, oh

CHORUS

And honey let me sing you a song
And listen to my words as they come out wrong
But don't run away, run away this time
Oh, and honey let me look in your eyes
You open them one at a time
But don't look away, don't look away
Don't look away, don't look away oh

And honey let me sing you a song
And listen to my words as they come out wrong
But don't run away, run away this time
Honey let me look in your eyes
Oh they burn like fire
But don't look away, look away this time
But don't look away, look away this time
Don't look away, look away this time
