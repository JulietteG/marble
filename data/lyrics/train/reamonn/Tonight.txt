She never took the train alone
She hated being on her own
She always took me by the hands
And say she needs me 
She never wanted love to fail
She always hoped that it was real 
She'd look me in the eyes
and said believe me.
And then the night becomes the day
And theres nothing left to say 
If there's nothing left to say
Then somethings wrong.

[Refrain]
Oh tonight, you killed me with your smile.
So beautiful and wild, so beautiful.
Oh tonight, you killed me with your smile.
So beautiful and wild so beautiful and wild.

And as the hands would turn with time
She'd always say that she was mine
She'd turn and lend a smile,
To say that she's gone.
But in a whisper she'd arrive
And dance into my life.
Like a music melody,
Like a lovers song.

[Refrain]
Oh tonight, you killed me with your smile.
So beautiful and wild, so beautiful.
Oh tonight, you killed me with your smile.
So beautiful and wild, so beautiful and wild.

Through the darkest night
Comes the brightest light.
And the light that shines
Is deep inside.
It's who you are.

[Refrain]
Oh tonight, you killed me with---Lyrics submitted by Ekin.
