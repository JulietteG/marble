A child like screaming
Get me out of here
You're the chosen one
And I believe
I saw you sleeping under skies so clear
You're the broken glass under my feet
And I can see the light
Tell me can you see the light
Of these Open skies
These open skies
These open skies
Wanna take me to you

Up here is freedom
From a world so blind
We're disappearing from who we are
We found a reason
To work it out
We found a clearing
Somewhere to start

Can you see the light
Tell me can you see the light
Of these Open skies
These open skies
These open skies
These open skies
Have come to save me

Don't panic now I can see the light
Don't panic now I can see the light
Don't panic now I can see the light
We'll make it through these open skies
These open skies
These open skies
These open skies
Gonna bring me to you

Don't panic now I can see the light
Don't panic now I can see the light
Don't panic now I can see the light---Lyrics submitted by Jay.
