Today I am stitched, I am sewn 
Patch me up, I've got want in my bones 
Like some doll you thought you could throw away 
I found my legs 

Ready to climb out from under concrete 
Only I get to be sickened by me 
My body a smudge 
Can't make out the details 
Want to start over and come into being 

Exhume our idols and bury our friends 
We're wild and weary but we won't give in 
We're sick with worry 
These nerve less days 
We live on dread in our own guilded age 

This dark world is precious to me 
My scars make me breathe in so deep 
My body has no need for sleep 
This time around 

Ready to find fragments of stillness 
Only I get to be punished by me 
Your voice is a crumb, it leads me from the wildness 
Wanna start over, forget everything 

Make me a headline 
I wanna be that bold 
Make me a spotlight 
So I can see the gold 

Make me a headline 
I wanna feel that bold 
Make me a spotlight 
So I can see the gold 

We speak in circles 
We dance in code 
Untame and hungry 
On fire in the cold 
Exhume our idols and bury our friends 
We're wild and weary but we won't give in---
