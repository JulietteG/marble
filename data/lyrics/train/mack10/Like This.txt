VERSE 1:
If it start off soft,I can turn it to hard,
Then hit the boulevard in a drop top with a broad,
I walk the green import and push fast cars,
With a fetish for bank wads and cuban cigars,
Yo, peep the way i do it,
I'm young,fly and flashy,
I'm so L.A, so hood and so classy,
Lookin' for that good stuff?
Dont hesitate to ask me,
Bet i got what you need,
So be sure to run it past me,
And just incase it's on,
Keep the blue steel and chrome,
The homies hop in and roam,
With khaki suits on,
And we real with it homes,
These rap dudes is clones,
Mess around with Mack Dime,
And foe' sho it be on,
As for my resume respect it,
Or be sure to check it,
I got a batch of that aquatic sure to get you naked,
So play your cards right and win before you deck it,
When i heard this beat knockin' foe' sho i had to wreck it,
C'mon!

HOOK:
Disrespect, get checked,
Snatch you up by your neck,
Young money tryin'a be the man too quick,
Homie this ain't checkers this a game of chess,
Why do i do it like this?
'cause you like it like this.
Talk alot of mess 'cause i do it the best,
Some of y'all don't like me but ya gimme respect
When i'm lying in the grave i guess i'll give it a rest,
Why do i do it like this?
'cause you like it like this

VERSE 2:
I got a large clientel for whatever i sell,
I don't guess the weight i tell with a digital scale,
I got money cut for bail,
But before i see a jail,
Im'a change clothes and roll like Jay and Pharrell,
I like to switch up my game and rotate my pros,
Park the GT Bentley and pull out the Phantom Rolls,
And i pack the kinda heat that you can't expose,
So my stash box enclosed with Fo'Fo's and calicos,
'cause your boy One-0 is ever so gun-ho,
No scope,I get up close my vision tunnel
Got that white by the bricks and green by the bundle,
With a crew of broads workin' its never just One-0 oh,

HOOK:
Disrespect, get checked,
Snatch you up by your neck,
Young money tryin'a be the man too quick,
Homie this ain't checkers this a game of chess,
Why do i do it like this?
'cause you like it like this.
Talk alot of mess 'cause i do it the best,
Some of y'all don't like me but ya gimme respect
When i'm lying in the grave i guess i'll give it a rest,
Why do i do it like this?
'cause you like it like this

VERSE 3:
I know you like it like this,
Like i said if it ain't ready i can rock it like this,
Foe' Sho im'a have the hood poppin' like this,
Mack 10 got that bomb beat drop it like this
I know you like it like this,
Like i said if it ain't ready i can rock it like this,
Foe' Sho im'a have the hood poppin' like this,
Mack 10 got that bomb beat drop it like this

HOOK:
Disrespect, get checked,
Snatch you up by your neck,
Young money tryin'a be the man too quick,
Homie this ain't checkers this a game of chess,
Why do i do it like this?
'cause you like it like this.
Talk alot of mess 'cause i do it the best,
Some of y'all don't like me but ya gimme respect
When i'm lying in the grave i guess i'll give it a rest,
Why do i do it like this?
'cause you like it like this
