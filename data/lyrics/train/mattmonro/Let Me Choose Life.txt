Let me choose life and the living of it
Let me find love and the giving of it
Let me be strong where once I was weak
Let my heart be heard in every word I speak
Let me find tears when its time for sorrow
Let me repay every joy Ive borrowed
Though life be short and the good times few
Let me live my life as a man must do

Though life be short and all the good times few
Let me live my life as a man must do
Let me choose life 
And share it all with you---Lyrics submitted by Matthew Paul.
