He bends and he breaks
If he gives they will take away
His passion
His pain
His grace

He exhales
A thousand black flowers explode
Into butterflies as they're away

Rip them out
Take them
Burn to coals as they crush and leave nothing
That resembles a soul of a man
See him numb
See him crushed
See him numb
See him crushed
Rip them out
Take them
Burn to coals as they crush and leave nothing
That resembles a soul of a man
Leave them numb
Leave them crushed
Leave them numb
Leave them crushed

Took the fire inside
One too many times
He's burning over and out now
He flails
Up against the raging tides
No more fights
Everything you ever wanted to see
See it in his eyes
One more time
One more time

Climb down to test the waters
My hands feel like they're rusting away
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
So I'll pace around like a lamb before the slaughter
I'll stay here as long as you let me
Decisions been made obvious so I will return
Where I started I'll stay here
When I'm finished I'll whither away

Rip them out
Take them
Burn to coals as they crush and leave nothing
That resembles a soul of a man
See him numb
See him crushed
See him numb
See him crushed
Rip them out
Take them
Burn to coals as they crush and leave nothing
That resembles a soul of a man
Leave them numb
Leave them crushed
Leave them numb
Leave them crushed---Lyrics submitted by Shelby Olson.
