Used to be I could make the pieces fit
Break the edges, force-fit all of this
How could I ever be so wrong?
Out of base we are doomed cus we begin
Kinda makes you wonder What's the sense?
How could I ever be so wrong?
And I know that fate keeps moving..

I can't help, but go back to it
The flame still burns at the back of it
And although, there is a lack of it
I won't forget how..

Simply put what's done is dead and gone
Can't forget, not for very long
There is no pride involved in love..
You can't manufacture happiness
Try forever you will be remissed
There is no pride involved in love
No pride involved..
And all that I know is that i know nothing..

I can't help, but go back to it
The flame still burns at the back of it
And although, there is a lack of it
I won't forget how..

You made me feel alive
But nothing lasts forever
Yet something deep inside
It takes me home again

I can't help, but go back to it
The flame still burns at the back of it
And although, there is a lack of it
I won't forget how..

You made me feel alive
But nothing lasts forever
Yet something deep inside
It takes me home again

And all that I know is that I know nothing
All that I know is I know nothing---Lyrics submitted by M..
