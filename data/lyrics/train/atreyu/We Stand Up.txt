I've watched the sun go dancing fall
And watched the night reign
Please note that casual
Observers are always the first to go
So this is for me and the boys
We'll always play our part
To kick and scream
To be the ones you hate to love
I can never turn my back because this is all I know
You know all that is the truth
We are all we have
In a world that corrupts the strongest soul
You know all that is the truth.

If you blink don't do it twice
I've still got something to say here.
I will bare my heart to expose my soul.
If honesty has a price then I won't fucking pay dear.
We will take our dreams straight to the grave.

Go choke on this
And on my words,
And on us,
And on my honesty.
It's of no consequence
Because I've seen the opulence.
The beauty I've held in my eyes
If only for seconds
Words will never take away
What we have built together
With our hands, with our hearts, with our minds.

If you blink don't do it twice
I've still got something to say here.
I will bare my heart to expose my soul.
If honesty has a price then I won't fucking pay dear.
We will take our dreams straight to the grave.

If this is just in our heads then
Then we'll keep on living our perfect lie
One day at a time
God bless our cheating hearts
And damn your lies

If this just in our heads then
We'll keep on living our perfect lie
One day at a time
God bless us.

If you blink don't do it twice
I've still got something to say here.
I will bare my heart to expose my soul.
If honesty has a price then I won't fucking pay dear.
We will take our dreams straight to the grave.---Lyrics submitted by Zach.
