Go!
Yea!

A wraith with an angel's body,
A demon with a smile of gold,
You soul-sucker!
I won't become like you,
A killer with the perfect weapons,
crystal eyes,
and a heart of coal.
You soul-sucker!
I won't lose myself in you.

Look how pretty she is, when she falls down
Now there is no beauty in, bleeding mascara
Lip are quivering, like a withering rose
She's back again!

What the fuck do you think love means?
It's much more than words and feelings,
Sucking, me dry!
Is my marrow that sweet?
Your dead lovers have left a trail of broken hearts and misspent hopes,
Sucking, them dry!
Does their marrow taste of sweetness, sweetness?
I hope you choke

[Guitar Solo]

Look how pretty she is, when she falls down,
Now there is no beauty in, bleeding mascara,
Lip are quivering, like a withering rose,

She's back again!
She's back a..
She's back again!
She's back.---Lyrics submitted by Phil.
