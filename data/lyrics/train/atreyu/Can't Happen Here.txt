[Verse 1]
Tearing his flesh in the dead of night
Subversiveness clouds the clearest of minds
Blink of an eye where the lateral lies
Raise up in heart never knowing why

[Pre-Chorus]
We get what we take when we take nothing
Pull the helmet from your eyes
We're erased and betrayed by mistakes

[Chorus]
Does your gun
know my gun?
This is how the world will end.

[Verse 2]
Indeed begs the questions
With bullets fill up the sky
Taking away the pain of
Thinking for ourselves
Tearing at break down
They break down our doors
Indeed begs the question
Could this save your realm
Stealing away our children
Taking away our dreams!

[Pre-Chorus]
