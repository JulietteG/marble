Standing on the edge,
battle in my head,
I'm dying to know
I'm dying to know


If I take this leap,
to fail or succeed,
I'm dying to know
I'm dying to know

This is it, I've shaken.
My body's aching,
I lose my hold,
I will let go.
This is it, I'm falling.
My wings need to grow.
I lose my hold,
I will let go.

There's so many roads,
pitfalls filled with doubt.
I'm dying to know,
I'm dying to know.

Grabbing what I need,
and rip it til it bleeds.
I'm dying to know,
I'm dying to know.

This is it, I've shaken.
My body's aching,
I lose my hold,
I will let go.
This is it, I'm falling.
My wings need to grow.
I lose my hold,
I will let go.

(Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum)

If I,
If I take this, this leap,
will I be broken?
I'm dying to...

This is it, I've shaken.
My body's aching,
I lose my hold,
I will let go.
I lose my hold,
this is it I'm falling.
I lose my hold,
my wings need to grow,
I lose my hold,
I will let go
I will let go.

I will let go!---Lyrics submitted by sacha.
