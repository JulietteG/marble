you should have ran for days
you embrace you betray
i am sick to say
you're a sad cliche' 
but when you ran you tripped and fell
on a path that lead you straight to hell
this my salt in your wounds
this is my "I told you so"

if you knew what I know
would you move like you do?
with malicious discontent
you went about hell-bent to destroy
but did you have a reason  why?

here's to lowering  caskets,
of old friends
choice and consequence
we'll birth a new day
with the death of an old and
start over , start over
here's to burying hatchets in those 
who you'd never call YOUR FRIEND..
we'll birth a new day with the death of an old day and..
start over , start over

can you breathe in reach and let it out
thee evil inside that's eating you out tonight
with every venomous move I will suck you up and spit you
get out of my life, get out of  my sight!

you let yourself get carried away
don't act like your Ashamed
you let your self get carried away
bow your head now,accept the blame
you let your self get carried away
bury this with you,a waste
And now it's time to see
what you don't mean to me

now it's time to see
what you don't mean to me
now it's time to see
what you don't mean to me

here's  to lowering caskets
of old friends
choice and consequence
we'll  birth a new day
with the death of an old and
start over, start over.
here's to Burying hatchets in those
who you'd never call your friend..
we'll Birth A new day with the death of an old day  And..---Lyrics submitted by guille.
