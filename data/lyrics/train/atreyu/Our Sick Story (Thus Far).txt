And we danced
So pristine and
Knee deep in sin
Balls deep in hate (I see your face)
I see your face and it tears me
It tears me up
My mouth was full of love
My head is held in shame

When you kiss me
Do you still taste her?
Are you thinking of
Are you thinking of me?
With your lips pressed tightly up against his skin
Does your body still scream my name?
Does your body still scream my name?

Hold your breath
And keep it
Trapped with secrets
Till your turning cold blue with guilt
Still no blood is spilt
Had I seen the plot twist coming
Would I have checked out the book?
And even if I was dead
You would never be off the fucking hook

When you kiss me,
Do you still taste her?
Are you thinking of
Are you thinking of me
With your lips
Pressed tightly up against his skin
Does your body still scream my name?
Does your body still scream my name?

Can you take it?
While I fake it
Can I take it?
While I fake it

Cross your heart
False your heart
Cross your heart
False your hear

When you kiss me
Do you still taste her?
Are you thinking of
Are you thinking of me?
With your lips pressed tightly up against his skin
Does your body still scream my name?
Does your body still scream my name?

Cross your heart
False your heart
Cross your heart
False your heart---Lyrics submitted by Katelyn.
