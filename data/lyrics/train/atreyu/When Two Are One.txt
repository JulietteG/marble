Bang!
Explosions in my head that just won't quit
A train has crashed into the wall around my heart
And left the old me dead, obliterated.

Stop!
My breathing in the night when you're not there
The silence ringing through my ears
And all I want to do is hear your voice
But you're not there

Drawn together
Painter's brush stroke
Slight of hand we
We won't go up in smoke
Fates colliding
Love undying

[Chorus (2x):]
Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify
I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes
Hope will never die

Go!
And take away the pain of being me
Soothe my soul, caress my heart
And end my fear, all my bad memories
Eradicated

Ring!
Like gunshots heard against the silent night
My love is louder than these words.
They're stronger than the rest, unstoppable
Unstoppable

Drawn together
Painter's brush stroke
Sleight of hand we
We won't go up in smoke
Fates colliding
Love undying

[Chorus (2x)]

DIE......

Drawn together
Painter's brush stroke
Sleight of hand we
We won't go up in smoke
Fates colliding
Love undying

[Chorus (2x)]

DIE......
