You're always looking back
running from the past
You're always sweating me
about the next big heart attack
you're looking over your shoulder
staring down the path

im falling down
falling down
falling down

-chorus- x2
It's in your head
all the voices mistaken
(shake it off, shake it off)
We're all dying in the end

I terrify me, images so horrible
(so horrible)
To clear my thoughts
I drill a hole into my skull
clean up my brains
sweep them underneath the rug
I need them more than I needed
any other drug

Im falling down
falling down
falling down

-chorus- x 2

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Come on!

Im falling down
falling down
falling down

-chorus- x 2
Dieing in the end!

Hey! Hey!

sing it!---Lyrics submitted by Jackson.
