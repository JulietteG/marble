So I'm afraid of what's to come
I hit the ground and run
Not sure what's coming next and never looking back
Hollow nights and empty days
Something had to change
Before it gets too late and there's no turning back

One by one we fit and then we fall (then we fall)
One by one we fit and then we fall
Lonely, is this what we've become?
So lonely, fragile and unloved
Lost inside ourselves and blindly staring at the sun
So lonely, is this what we've become?

Line them up, they fall
Something to live for
Not sure who's coming next but never looking back
I want something more
Something to live for
Before it gets too late and there's no turning back

One by one we fit and then we fall (then we fall)
One by one we fit and then we fall
Lonely, is this what we've become?
So lonely, fragile and unloved
Lost inside ourselves and blindly staring at the sun
So lonely, is this what we've become?

One by one we fit and then we fall (then we fall)
One by one we fit and then we fall
Lonely, is this what we've become?
So lonely, fragile and unloved
Lost inside ourselves and blindly staring at the sun
So lonely, is this what we've become?

Is this what we've become?
So lonely, fragile and unloved
Lost inside ourselves and blindly staring at the sun
So lonely, is this what we've become?---Lyrics submitted by M..
