Your there for me
through all of my ups and downs
and what i feel you always seem to know.
you find the words when i need comforting
and dry my eyes thats why i love you so.

[chorus]
more then a friend your my first love
i can always depend on my first love.

Feel like i have known you all my life.
i cant explain how close we are.
when somethings wrong (wrong) you know how to make it right.
Thats why you stay close to my heart.

[chorus]
more then a friend your my first love.
i can always depend on my first love.

The first thought in my mind.
the chill up my spine.
the melody in my heart.
you are my very first love.
your the sweet lullaby.
my first kiss goodnight.
the beat in my heart.
music.
my very first love.

[chorus]
more then a friend your my first love.
i can always depend on my first love.

With you in my life im not lonely at all
and if there were tears you'd catch them all.
cause you know my pain
and you know my joy
theres no secrets between us only pretty piano chords


The first thought in my mind.
the chill up my spine.
the melody in my heart.
music.
my very first love.
your the sweet lullaby.
my first kiss goodnight.
the beat in my heart.
music.
my very first love.

i sing because i'm happy
the music sets me free.

your the sweet lullaby.
my first kiss goodnight.
the beat in my heart.
music.
my very first love.---Lyrics submitted by Danielle.
