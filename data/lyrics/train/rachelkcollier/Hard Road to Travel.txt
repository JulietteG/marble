I've got a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
I've got a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see me through

I'm all alone, this lonesome road I roam
I've got no love to call my very own
Oh the river gets deeper, the hills get steeper
And the pain gets deeper every day, yeah

I've got a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see me through

Aah, oh oh
Aah, oh oh

I dream of a home far beyond the sea
Where there is love and peace and joy for me
Oh, in my eyes I see troubles and dangers for me
But destiny where it leads me I must go, hey

I've got a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see me through

Aah, oh oh
Aah, oh oh---
