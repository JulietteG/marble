Come here
ooh ooh
Holiday uh huh
Platinum Brother
Hey girl how you doing
What your name is looking like a model 
Of somebody famous
Where's that nigga that you came with
If you here alone baby we gone have to change this (change this)
Cause you sexy than a mothafucka(mothafucka)
To get to know you girl i'd really love to tonight
Get to show you a good time and get it cracking with a slow grind 
Chorus:
Damn shorty you look sexy as hell 
And now grinding you dont know what it does to me 
i'll put my head right here grab your booty right there 
Baby dont be scared come on
Come here come here
I know you wanna come closer 
Come here come here
I want you closer and closer
Verse 2:
Got me feeling this as were bumping and 
Grinding on some R.kelly shit and i'm feeling good
Cause you breaking it down like you dont know
Who your really messing with
Ah Ah Ah
I wanna pull you closer to me 
Ah Ah Ah
Put my hands on your booty
I wanna show you a good time
And pop it off with a show grind
Chorus:
Bridges:
This is for all my sexy ladies i've been watching
You baby and i really wanna dance with you
And you 
And you 
And you too
So many here for me to choose from
It's hard for me to choose one 
You dont know what it does to me 
But i choose you baby 
You baby
Chorus:
oooooh baby 
aaaaaah baby come on---Lyrics submitted by Jazmine.
