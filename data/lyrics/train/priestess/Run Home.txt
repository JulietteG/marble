I fell for the company girl
And it leaves me in charge
She don't pay what the salary will
And no company car
And it hurts when it pounds along with this heartbeat. 
Well it's taking its toll, but it won't for very long 
I'll run home, I'm gone
Back to the factory wheel
Believe me I'm in charge
I fell back on a factory girl
But they take me apart
And it hurts when they pound along with this heartbeat. 
And if I leave it this way, then it won't be there at all 
I'm back to the factory wheel
And it keeps me coming home
It takes me apart
And it hurts when it pounds with this heart, so I'll run home, I'm gone---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
