I stumble through the wreckage, rusted from the rain
There's nothing left to salvage, no-one left to blame
Among the broken mirrors, I don't look the same
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

Dissect me 'til my blood runs down into the drain
My bitter heart is pumping oil into my veins
I'm nothing but a tin man, I don't feel any pain
I don't feel any pain, I'm rusted from the rain

Go on...crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Go on...strip me of my powers, beat me with your chains
And if...I'm the King of cowards, you're the Queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

You hung me like a picture, now I'm just a frame
I used to be a lap dog, now I'm just a stray
Shackled in a graveyard, left here to decay
Left here to decay, I'm rusted from the rain

Go on...crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Go on...strip me of my powers, beat me with your chains
And if...I'm the King of cowards, you're the Queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain---Lyrics submitted by kristopher.
