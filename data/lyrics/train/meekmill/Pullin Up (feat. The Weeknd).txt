We wanted the world baby
Thats why we ended how we ended
We chose to live how we live
Well now you found the one, baby
And you aint tryna see nobody but him
Nobody but him
Ooh, ooh
But I know you well
Ooh, ooh
Girl I know you well

Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin up
Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up

Pull up on you, put it on you
Fuck you in the car, if he looking for you
Seen you with your man and said what up to ya
Like you aint give me that work
It was California 5 in the morning
I was plotting on ya, we was hot as suana
Tryna pop up on ya and fuck you good on that Purp
We ended up getting faded
We fell in love and we made it
We only fucked we never never dated
Come get your lady
Holla [?] told me she skated
That pussy was good as confessions
Im in the latest
She ride the D like Mercedes
I might just call her Mercedes
Rocking margiela I might just design like a mason
Dont tell nobody you my baby
She fell in love with the real
Now she dont fuck with the fakers
Me and her nigga was sharing a home
Im talking like Clippers and Lakers
And she get the D from a faker
That pussy got me going crazy
I know that these niggas gon hate it
But we only trip when we trip to Jamaica
Just tell em

Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up

Pullin' up on that new thang
Muse and my boo thang
And shes a dime like whos saying
And we kick shit, Liu Kang
Problem is there only one me
Im like Bun B how I screw things
Front stroke, back stroke
I came, you came
And your main nigga aint fuckin with me
He aint fuckin with me
Tell that nigga go wait inside
When I pull up on you, you coming with me
Talk dirty, you say its mines
You say its mine when Im coming in it
Broke boys dont deserve pussy
Therefore, you aint fucking with her
Imma be there when that nigga get fly
Soon as he slippin, Im making you mine
Buy you a rollie to make up for time
And flood it all out to make sure you shine girl
Im never waiting in line, girl
Let me just take you my world, girl
Soon as that man stop frontin on you
You get the D from behind, girl

Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up---
