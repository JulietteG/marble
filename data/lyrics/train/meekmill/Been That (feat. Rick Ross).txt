I been that nigga before the money and the fame
I been that nigga before the diamonds and the chain
I been that nigga before the foams and the clothes
I been that nigga on the corner with the most
I been that nigga I been that nigga
My dogs a shooter please don't make me send that nigga
I been that nigga I been that nigga
If they keep talking I'll make him pin that nigga

I been that nigga on the corner nappy braids and selling hard
Now I pull up on em bitches got them texting oh my god
I got bitches out in paris that be texting oh la la
I hear back like who this she hear back you forgot
Real niggas gone link up but my h town pouring drank up
Just me and ... in the brinks truck
Doing all this shit we ain't think of
Trying to wild out so we draped up
I'm blue-dottin that pink stuff
... putting that pussy on me
Ten bands throw her mink up
I got money all up in my mind ho
What do you think think I grind for?
Condoms all in my condo
Pocket change ...
My niggas my niggas
My niggas my hitters
We're gonna get richer
I'm talking about bigger and bigger
They stealing my swag ...

I been that nigga before the money and the fame
I been that nigga before the diamonds and the chain
I been that nigga before the foams and the clothes
I been that nigga on the corner with the most
I been that nigga I been that nigga
My dogs a shooter please don't make me send that nigga
I been that nigga I been that nigga
If they keep talking I'll make him pin that nigga

Blew a half a kilo on my cuban link to watch it swing
No short, baking soda standing at the sink
Swerving in my wraith I should just pull up at the church
Have these niggas playing on me devils wish it was a hearse
In my all black shades motherfucking Ray Charles
I used to mop the floors now who the motherfucking boss?
I been that nigga that could get em by the ...
Snow white, no spikes, two stacks for my lubes
You a fool for your wifey and I passed her to my crew
Coke white, sour creme, butter all in my coupe
Put my dogs on celery see we all be blowing loud
Chopper still might judge a jury I could take this bitch to trial

I been that nigga before the money and the fame
I been that nigga before the diamonds and the chain
I been that nigga before the foams and the clothes
I been that nigga on the corner with the most
I been that nigga I been that nigga
My dogs a shooter please don't make me send that nigga
I been that nigga I been that nigga
If they keep talking I'll make him pin that nigga ---
