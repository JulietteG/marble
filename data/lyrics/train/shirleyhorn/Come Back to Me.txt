Hear my voice, where you are
Take a train, steal a car
Hop a freight, grab a star
Come back to me

Catch a flame, catch a breeze
On your hands, on your knees
Swim or fly, only please
Come on back to me

On a mule, on a jet
Put yourself in a net
But come back to me yet
I don't care, this is where you should be

From the hills, from the shore
Ride the wind to my door, turn the highway into dust
Break the law if you must, move the world only just
Come back to me

What on earth must I do
Scream and yell till I'm blue
Curse your soul when will you
Come on back to me

Have you gone to the moon
Or the corner saloon
And to crack and to croon
I don't care, this is where you should be

In a crate, in a trunk
On a horse, on a drunk
In a road or a van
Wrap yourself in saran
Anyway that you can
Come back to me

Come back to me
Come back to me---Lyrics submitted by Invisible.
