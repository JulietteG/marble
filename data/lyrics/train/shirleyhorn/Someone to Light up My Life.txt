Go on your way,
with a cloudless blue sky above

May all your days
be a wonderful song of love
Open your arms
& sing of the all the hidden hopes you've ever treasured
and live out your life
in peace

Where shall I look?
for the love to replace you
Someone to light up my life
Someone with strange little ways, 
eyes like a blue autumn haze
Someone with your loving style
& a smile that I know will keep haunting me endlessly
Sometimes in stars or the swift flight of sea birds
I catch a memory of you
That's why i walk all alone
Searching for something I've known
Searching for something or someone to light up my life

That's why I walk all alone
Searching for something I've known
Searching something or someone to light up my life

Searching for something or someone to light up my life---Lyrics submitted by Rachel Pierce.
