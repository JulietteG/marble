~8 Bars~
Why....didn't I see
Your eyes....turning on me
Had I been gentle...when you told me goodbye
I might have caused a smile instead of your weary sigh

But NO...I let you go,
Without letting you know
How I depended on the loves that we shared
Or what is meant to me to know you were there
Quietly there,
Happily there,
I must have hurt you so many quarrels ago.......Oh

No.......you couldn't see
The love hidden in me
I stay out late now,I don't want to go home
Its dawn when I reach the door
What do I have in store
Only the quiet prayer you're waiting quietly there
~16 Bars ~
No... couldn't you see
The love hidden in me
I stay out late now,I don't want to go home
Its dawn when I reach the door
What do I have in store
Only the quiet prayer you're waiting quietly there---Lyrics submitted by Debbie Davis.
