(ro-roll the credits credits credits)
boy, in the beginin'
in the beginin' it was me, and you
i was Bonny you were Clyde
and we were runnin'
we were runnin for the list we knew

(ro-roll the credits)
but then, in the middle,
in the middle 
you went and changed the script
took a pencil and erased my happy endin'
instead of loving you
i feel so sick

(ro-roll the credits)
i know you directed it
i'm sure i produed a bit
so why's that chick stealin my show

[chorus part 1]

baby tell me
who is she
i need to know her name and number
tell me
who does she 
hang out with when you're not together
i aint gonna do nothin' crazy,
i just need you to hear me

(ro-roll the credits) 
Roll the Credits

[chorus part 2]

and tell me 
how many
of your friends you told all about it
they said 
you workin'
last friday night
when i was callin
did you lie to all of them too
or was i just a fool

(ro-roll the credits)
Roll the Credits
(yeah yeah)

you worked under cover
gave her every single line
i owned
and it doesn't make me
feel any better
that you took her places 
we would go
(ro-roll the creits)
i thought you meant for me
my name should be on that screan
tell me whi's that chick 
playin' my roll


(chorus 1)
baby tell me
who is she
i need to know her name and number
tell me
who does she 
hang out with when you're not together
i aint gonna do nothin' crazy,
i just need you to hear me

we weren't even at the end
but you started auditionin'
and let someone else
star in my show

(chorus 1)
baby tell me

hang out with when you're not together
i aint gonna do nothin' crazy,
