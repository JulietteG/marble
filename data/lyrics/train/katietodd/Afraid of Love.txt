Im heading out to where the people cant pronounce my name
Say it loud babe (x2)
The sun is out and shining but the air is tasting gray
Shut your door babe (x2)

Now shes walking without shoes and then she kneels on down to pray
Then youre trying hard to remind her so she doesnt slip away
And over there you are safe in your haven
Over there you are meant to be
All along you were wrong but it was too late you were gone
Moving on, afraid of love

Now its pretty hard to not notice when she uped and ran away
She was seventeen and I think holding it above all was afraid that shed make way
And over there you are safe in your haven
Over there you are meant to be
All along you were wrong 
but it was too late you were gone
Moving on, afraid of love

Over there you are safe in your haven
Over there you are meant to be
All along you were wrong 
but it was too late you were gone
Moving on, afraid of love---Lyrics submitted by Kristi.
