4 a.m and she can't,
get herself any sleep,
too much on her mind.

She wishes she wasn't here,
wish she could disappear,
and leave it all behind.

This girl I know,
this girl she's breaking.
This girl I know
This girl she's fading.

She looks him in the eyes,
behind a smile she cries,
same ole' lies.

She's holding on to a sound,
doesn't want it to end,
but it already died.

This girl I know
this girl she's breaking.
This girl I know
This girl she's fading.

This girl I know...ohhh
She's holding on to nothing,
She won't let go,

This girl..
This girl..

This girl I know
this girl she's breaking.
This girl I know
This girl she's fading....

4 a.m and she can't
get herself any sleep..
too much on her mind.

She wishes she wasn't here,
wish she could disappear,
and leave it all behind....

This girl,
This girl...

This girl i know
this girl.........---Lyrics submitted by ash.
