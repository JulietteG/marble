Every time I close my eyes
Its you and I know now
Who I am

Yea yea yea and I know now

Theres a place I go
When Im alone
Do anything I want
Be anyone I wanna be
But it is us I see
And I cannot believe Im fallin
Thats where Im goin
Where are you goin
Hold it close wont let this go

Dream catch me, yea
Dream catch me when I fall
Or else I wont come back at all

You do so much
That you dont know
Its true
And I know now
Who I am

Yea yea yea
And I know now

Theres a place I go
When Im alone
Do anything I want
Be anyone I wanna be
But it is us I see
And I cannot believe Im fallin
Thats where Im goin
Where are you goin
Hold it close wont let this go

Dream catch me, yea
Dream catch me when I fall
Or else I wont come back at all

See you as a mountain
A fountain of God
See you as as a descant soul
in the setting sun
You as the sound
Just as silent as none

Im young
Theres a place I go
When Im alone
Do anything I want
Be anyone I wanna be
But it is us I see
And I cannot believe Im fallin

Theres a place I go
When Im alone
Do anything I want
Be anyone I wanna be
But it is us I see
And I cannot believe Im fallin
Thats where Im goin
Where are you goin
Hold it close wont let this go

Dream catch me, yea
Dream catch me when I fall
Or else I wont come back at all---Lyrics submitted by Marykate.
