somehow i know i will find a way to a brighter day in the sun ,somewhere i know that he waits for me someday soon he'll see im the one ,i wont give up on this feeling and nothing could keep me away         cause i still believe in destiny that you and i were ment to be i still wish on the stars as they fall from above cause i still believe ,belive in love ,i know whats real cannot be denied although it may hide for a while,with just one touch love can conquer fears turning all your tears into smile its such a wonderous feeling i know that my heart cant be wrong , cause i still believe in destiny that you and i were ment to be i still wish on the stars as they fall from above cause i still believe in love ,love can make miracles change everything lift you from the darkness and make your heart sing love is a river when you fall it's the greatest power of all!!!!!!!cause i still believe in destiny that you and i were ment to be i still wish on the stars as they fall from above yes i still believe believe in loooooooooooooooooove.i still believe in looooooooooooooooooove!!!! in looooooooooooooooooooooove.---Lyrics submitted by Ruth.
