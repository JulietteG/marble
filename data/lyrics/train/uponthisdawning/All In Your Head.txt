Only god owns the truth
 who am I to judge what you do?

I'll pray for all your sins, but those eyes have seen the end
 mercy comes through the hands of death
 I will never give up until you're blessed

No, it's hard to go on when you're lost
 my everything falls
 save me with all your love

Wake up this all in your head
 take a breath, take the deepest breath you can
 drowning in your darkest thoughts
 how do you recognize what's hate or love?

I'll pray for all your sins, but those eyes have seen the end
 mercy comes through the hands of death
 I will never give up until you're blessed

No, it's hard to go on when you're lost
 my everything falls
 save me with all your love---Lyrics submitted by Ohailana Alesansa.
