It's time for me now to leave you
 I was thinking on it from a long time, I have to go
 It's not a problem for you to live without me
 I have to go, I write you a letter
 Dear friends, parents and others
 I've tried to live without your helps, your smiles
 Now I've realize that I was always wrong with you
 So now I go, I have decided to leave me all alone

[Chorus:]
 So I can say that
 I have realized that all what I've done was wrong
 So please don't try 
 I've stopped my life, I've burned my memories and lies

Now that I think I can remember
 There was a time where we made jokes on life of everyday
 They were days full of happiness and hope (but now)
 But those days are dead with my soul

[Chorus]

Don't try to look for me
 Try to put away all my memories
 I won't let you follow my reasons
 This sweet suicide is mine, not yours

Don't try to look for me
 Try to put away all my memories
 I won't let you follow my reasons
 This sweet suicide is mine

(Die alone, this life is so hard) I wish you follow the best way (don't go away)
 (Die alone, burn with my heart) Forget all those bad days with a new life (please stay with me tonight)
 (Die alone, this life is so hard) I know that is no easy to ignore
 (Die alone) I'm dead, I've burned all memories and lies---Lyrics submitted by samia amjad.
