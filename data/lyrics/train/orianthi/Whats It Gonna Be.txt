well he don't need me, cause he wants to be free, well he left me right, went out the door last night. well he calls me cause he needs me, i feel torn inside 

(chorus) 
so what's it gonna be this time, cause all you wanna see is me cry, yeah i don't wanna stay around, cause all you do is you bring me down, so what's it gonna be baby now. 

well i don't need you, cause i want this through, yeah i left you with, with everything i could give, and you text me cause you need me, i just won't reply. 

(chorus) 
so what's it gonna be this time, cause all you wanna see is me cry, yeah i don't wanna stay around, cause all you do is you bring me down, so what's it gonna be 

so what's it gonna be this time, cause all you wanna see is me cry, yeah i don't wanna stay around, cause all you do is you bring me down, so what's it gonna be 

He don't need me, cause he wants to be free, well he left me right 

(chorus) 
so what's it gonna be this time, cause all you wanna see is me cry, yeah i don't wanna stay around, cause all you do is you bring me down, so what's it gonna be 

so what's it gonna be this time, cause all you wanna see is me cry, yeah i don't wanna stay around, cause all you do is you bring me down, so what's it gonna be 

so what's it gonna be
