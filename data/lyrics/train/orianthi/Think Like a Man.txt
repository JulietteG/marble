Must be you if the phone don't ring 
Here i am obsessing 
He loves me ,yea, he loves me not 
I tell myself i should just learn to shut up 
No, I need to be like you 

Ignore my emotions, emotions are dumb 
Surfing the channels, 'till my senses are numb 
Shorten my attention span, 
I should think like a man 

Stick my foot in my mouth and just run away 
Turn up my sound, i ain't got nothing to say 
Disappear and not give a damn 
I should think like a man 
I should think like a man 

Oblivious it must be nice 
Nothing spoils your appetite 
Your checking out every blonde in sight 
Your telling me that it's just all in my mind 
Yeah, i want to be like you 

Ignore my emotions, emotions are dumb 
I'm surfing the channels, 'till my senses are numb 
Shorten my attention span, 
I should think like a man 

Stick my foot in my mouth and just run away 
Turn up my sound i ain't got nothing to say 
Disappear and not give a damn 
I should think like a man 
I should think like a man 

I could save myself so much trouble 
I could save myself this heartache 
But it's the best advice I know I'll never ever take 

Yea I got to, I need to, I want to be like you 

Ignore my emotions, emotions are dumb 
I'm surfing the channels, till my senses are numb 
Shorten my attention span, 
I should think like a man 

Stick my foot in my mouth and just run away 
Turn up my sound, i ain't got nothing to say 
Disappear and not give a damn 
I should think like a man 
I should think like a man 
I should think like a man---Lyrics submitted by Violet.
