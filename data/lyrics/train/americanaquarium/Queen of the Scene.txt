She was tall and pale
She's the queen of her scene
Hates the way I talk
But she loves the way I sing
She spends too much time being something she ain't
When smoke all clears there's always
There's always someone to blame

When you spend all your time trying to make things right
You can't clean it up if its broken inside
Never one to listen to a single word I say
No matter how much I ask her

Chorus:
Well I am what I am 
Babe, I ain't what I ain't
I'm not yet a killer
But I'm far from a saint
I really think it matters what I do
I don't think I'll ever be
Good enough for you

She doubted me like Thomas 
When I needed her like Paul
Turned her back on me like Judas
Then let me take the fall
She called me a traitor
And she called me liar
She fed me to the lions and hung me
Aw, she hung me out to dry

Chorus

So I hear you got a new boy, looks a lot like me
I'll bet he can't sing like I sing
So I'll just sit back babe and I'll play my part
He may have your hand but I still
Oh I still got your heart

Got your heart
Oh, I got your heart
Whoa, got your heart
Oh I got your heart
You know I got your heart
Whoa I got your heart---Lyrics submitted by B Braud.
