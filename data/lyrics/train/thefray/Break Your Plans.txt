I wish I had cheated
At least thats a reason
Id understand why youre leaving now

We both stopped breathing
It could not last
I guess Im just afraid to ask

But what if you dont?
What if you stay and...

Break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
Theres no guarantee well make it, make this thing right
But break your plans for me tonight
Tonight...

You call this closure
Its barely over
How do you move on so fast?

Maybe theres someone
Maybe its all gone
I guess Im just afraid to look back

But all that counts
Is what comes next

Break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
Theres no guarantee well make it, make this thing right
Break your plans for me tonight

And I know better
Than to stay just wondering for it
Will you stay and be with me?

Break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
Theres no guarantee well make it, no guarantee well make it
Just break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
Theres no guarantee well make it, no guarantee well make it
Just break your plans for me tonight---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
