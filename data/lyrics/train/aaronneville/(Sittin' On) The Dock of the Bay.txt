Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Watchin' the ships roll in
Then I watch'em roll away again

Yeah, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
'Cause I've had nothin' to live for
Look like nothin' gonna come my way

So I'm just gon' sit on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Looks like nothin's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to
So I guess I'll remain the same

Sittin' here restin' my bones
And this lonliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Looks like nothin's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to
So I guess I'll remain the same

Sittin' here restin' my bones
And this lonliness won't leave me alone
Two thousand miles away I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
