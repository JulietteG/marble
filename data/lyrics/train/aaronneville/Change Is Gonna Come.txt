I was born by the river 
In a little tent
Oohhh an just like the river rapid
I've been running ever since

It's been a long 
A long time coming
But i know change gonna come
Oh yes it will

Its been too hard living
But i'm afaid to die
Cause i don't know what's up there
Beyond the sky

Ooh It's been a long 
A long time coming
But i know change gonna come
Oh yes it will

Oh When i go to my brother
And i say " Brother help, me please"
But he winds up knocking me
Right down on my, my knees

And there been times that i though
I couldn't last for long
Now i think i'm able
To carry on

Its been a long
Long time coming
But i know change gonna come
Oh yes it will

(X2)
It's been a long
A long, long time coming
but i know change gonna come
oh yes it will---Lyrics submitted by morrise.
