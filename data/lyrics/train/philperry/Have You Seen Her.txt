Ahh, ooo
Ahh, ooo

One month ago today, I was happy as a lark
But now, I go for walks, to the movies, and maybe to the park
I have a seat on the same old bench, and I watch the children play, huh
You know, tomorrow's their future, but for me, just another day
They all gather 'round me, huh - yeah they seem to know my name
We laugh, and we tell a few jokes, but it still doesn't ease my pain
I know I can't hide from a memory, though day after day I've tried
I keep saying, "She'll be back," but today, again I've lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her, tell me have you seen her
Oh I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her, tell me have you seen her

Why, oh why did she have to leave and go away
Oh, I've been used to having someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby I'm lost
Woah, Have you seen her, tell me have you seen her
Woah, Have you seen her, tell me have you seen her

she left her kiss upon my lips
But left a break within my heart
Have you seen her, tell me have you seen her
Oh I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her, tell me have you seen her.

Why, oh why did she have to leave and go away, oh yeah
Oh, I've been used to having someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby I'm lost
Woah, Have you seen her, tell me have you seen her, woah.

As another day comes to an end, I'm looking for a letter
Or something, anything that she would send
With all the people I know, I'm still a lonely man
You know, it's funny, I thought I had her
In the palm of my hand.
