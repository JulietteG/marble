Don't want to be with you
You singing some one else's song
And all the stuff you did before
Before I came along
I'm not the one
We can't be one like this
I want to love you
But I need us to be thinking the same
And all the stuff you holding on to
Baby I'm not to blame
I want to love
I want to love you like this

I want the best for us, I want us to win
I can't keep this up, being like this

I can't love you like this, can't hold you like this
When we argue like this, why we do this?
I can't love you like this, why we going through this?
All this uncomfortableness

Why we going through these changes? 
This is so messed up
Do you remember what I told you when we first hooked up? 
I want to love you, I want to love you like this
You had me thinking I was wrong for you, you know I'm right
You know how good my loving is because you said last night
I want to love you, I want to love you like this

I want the best for us, I want us to win
I can't keep this up, being like this

I can't love you like this, can't hold you like this
When we argue like this, why we do this?
I can't love you like this, why we going through this?
All this uncomfortableness

Why we keep going the wrong direction? 
I just want to give you love and affection
soft words kisses day and night
If you let me Imma love you till the morning light
All I want to do is love you like this
We don't need to be going through this
Oh, I want to love ya, love ya

I get tired of arguing with you baby
Just want to love you baby
Aye I give you everything you ask for from me
Why can't we just be together baby
Aye just want to love you
Aye just want to be there for you baby
Love you baby be there for you baby
Aye just want to love you
like this---
