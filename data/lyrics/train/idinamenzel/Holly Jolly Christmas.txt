Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when we walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone we meet

Oh ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss him once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly
Christmas this year

Oh ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss him once for me

So have a holly jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly
Christmas this year---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
