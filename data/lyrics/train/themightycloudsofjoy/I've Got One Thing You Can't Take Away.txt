Ive got one thing you cant take away from me;
Ive got one thing you cant take away from me;
Ive got one thing you cant take away from me;
You can kill this old body, 
lay it down in the cold rain,
but Ive got one thing 
you cant take away from me.

Ive got Jesus, and you cant take Him away from me.
Ive got Jesus, and you cant take Him away from me.
You can kill this old body, lay it down in the cold rain,
but Ive got Jesus, and you cant take Him away

Ive got His love, and you cant take it away from me.
Ive got His love, and you cant take it away from me.
You can kill this old body, lay it down in the cold rain,
but Ive got His love, and you cant take it away---Lyrics submitted by Reverend Menzel.
