Oh yeah.

Boots and buckles, red clay and sand
My point aint subtle here, Im a Southern man
Where the beer seems cooler and the women seem hotter
Where the world dont seem so damn modern
And a good ole boy like me still has a chance
This is where I was Born this is where Ill die
Yeah, this is where I was born and this is where Ill die

Its all about the South
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina, 
Dont you wanna get down and dirty
Cause, Florida Im thirsty, 
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, you crazy old timer, sweet magnolia, dive bars and diners, oh yeah
Oh, and even if youre up North, cmon down, cmon down
Oh, its all about the South.

From daddys Don Williams to Mamas Patsy Cline
Oh, Were Walkin After Midnight singing Tulsa Time, Oh, yeah
Where the beer seems cooder and the women seem hotter
Where the world dont seem so damn modern
Yeah,This is where I was Born this is where Ill die
Oh Thats Right!

Its all about the South
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina, 
Dont you wanna get down and dirty
Cause, Florida Im thirsty, 
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, you crazy old timer, sweet magnolia, dive bars and diners, oh yeah
Oh, and even if youre up North, cmon down, cmon down
Oh, its all about the South.

[Instrumental]

Cmon
Yeah
Bring it on down and sing it with me now
(Gang vocals)
This is where I was born and this is where Ill die (yeah, this is where Ill die)
This is where I was born and this were Ill die ..

Chorus:
Its all about the South
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina, 
Dont you wanna get down and dirty
Cause, Florida Im thirsty, 
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia, dive bars and diners, oh yeah
Oh, and even if youre up North, cmon down, cmon downoh,
I said
Even if youre up North, cmon down, cmon down
Oh, its all about the South.---
