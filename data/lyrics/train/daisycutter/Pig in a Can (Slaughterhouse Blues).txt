Hard time being a cow
Hard time being a cow
Once you live in the dark, you can't see
Once you live in the dark, you can't see
Once you you feel your life
Once you see the blood
start to flow
Feel. Dark. 
Feel dead
Feeling like a pig in a can
Feeling like a pig in a can
Feeling like a piece of meat, you don't know
Feeling like a piece of meat, you don't know
Once you see the knife
Once you see the blood
start to flow
You feel. Dark
Feel dead---Lyrics submitted by seth.
