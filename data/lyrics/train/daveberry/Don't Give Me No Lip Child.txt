Don't gimme no lip child
Don't talk back to me
Don't gimme no lip child
That ain't the way it's gonna be

If you want my true, true loving
You better cool all your shoving
All your shoving
All your shoving

Don't gimme no lip child
Better watch what you do
Don't gimme no lip child
Or I'll be finding someone new

Someone who will give me true loving
Instead of all this pushing and a-shoving
Pushing and a-shoving
Pushing and a-shoving

Don't gimme no lip child
Don't talk back to me
Don't gimme no lip child
That ain't the way it's gonna be

If you want my true, true loving
You better cool all your shoving
All your shoving
All your shoving

Don't gimme no lip child
I mean what I say
Don't gimme no lip child
Or you'll be sorry one fine day, now

You been breaking all my rules and
You better stop or you're sure to be cooling
Gonna be cooling
Gonna be cooling

Yeah, don't give me no lip child
I mean what I say, now...
