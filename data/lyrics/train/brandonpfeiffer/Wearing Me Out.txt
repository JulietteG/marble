Let's pretend love is just something we don't need
but you were the only one that I could talk to
well take it or leave me, haven't we all seen
the roll, the eyes, the punch, the fight
you know what I mean when I say...

It's wearing me out

now hasn't this all been fun?
and we've all got something, more or less, to show for it
well this time, it's time for me to regret my bets
I can see I gotta cash in, check out, pick up my stuff
baby i've had enough now now now

it's wearing me out---Lyrics submitted by bug.
