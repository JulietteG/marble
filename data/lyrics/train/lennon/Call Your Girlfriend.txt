Call your girlfriend, I think it's time you talked
Give your reasons, say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new

Tell her not to get upset,
Second guessing everything you said and done
And when she gets upset tell her
How you never meant to hurt no one

And tell her that the only way her heart will mend
Is when she learns to love again
But it won't make sense right now
Cause you're still her friend and that you let her down easy

Call your girlfriend, I think it's time you talked (time you talked)
Give your reasons, (ohhh) say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new

And tell her when I give you something
That you never even knew you missed
Don't even try and explain
How it's so different when we kiss

And tell her that the only way her heart will mend
Is when she learns to love again
But it won't make sense right now
Cause you're still her friend and that you let her down easy---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
