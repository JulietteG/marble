I'm not alone
Even when we're apart I feel you
In the air
(yeah)
I'm not afraid
I know what you're thinkin'
I can hear you everywhere

Some people say it'll never happen
And we're just wasting time
But good things come when you least expect them
So I don't really mind

We'll be together come whatever
Not just staring at the stars
Just remember
That no one else could tell us who we are
We'll be together so don't ever
Stop listening to your heart
Cause I can't turn mine off
Oh (yeah, yeah) oh

I can't pretend
This is a rehearsal for the real thing
Because it's not
And I know we're young
I can't help feeling what I'm feeling
And I won't stop

Some things are meant to be and will be there
When the time is right
Even though I know that

I swear I wish you were tonight

We'll be together come whatever
Not just staring at the stars
Just remember
That no one else could tell us who we are
We'll be together so don't ever
Stop listening to your heart
Cause I can't turn mine off

Oh yeah
I like what's happening to me
Oh yeah
Nothing else to say
Oh, Oh yeah
Somebody finally got to me
Carry me away

We'll be together come whatever
Not just staring at the stars
Just remember
That no one else could tell us who we are
We'll be together so don't ever
Stop listening to your heart
Cause I can't turn mine off
Oh oh yeah, yeah
(we'll be together come whatever, come whatever, come whatever, come whatever)
Ah oh

I'm not alone
Even when we're apart I feel you---Lyrics submitted by dhanissta.
