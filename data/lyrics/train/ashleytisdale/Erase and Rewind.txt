I dont wanna feel like this
I dont want to, I dont want to
I dont wanna freak you out
But I

I think I might have said too much
Didnt mean to, didnt mean to
Think I might have said its you and I

Guess I should leave this behind
Guess I should erase and rewind
But somehow I cant seem to stay away
I dont want to sound desperate, but I am
So say that youll come around
Guess I should erase and rewind
Erase and rewind

I dont want to stand in line
Like I used to, like I used to
I dont wanna have to scream and shout
Cause Im the kind of girl that sticks
Like a tattoo, like a tattoo
Yeah Im the kind of girl that wears you out
Ah Oh

Guess I should leave this behind
Guess I should erase and rewind
But somehow I cant seem to stay away
I dont want to sound desperate, but I am
So say that youll come around
Guess I should erase and rewind
Erase and rewind

You never do returns my calls
Just like we never met at all
No matter what, Ill always wait for you
Ill wait for you, Ill wait for you
I dont wanna feel like this, I dont want to
Yeah eh eh eh eh

Guess I should leave this behind
Guess I should erase and rewind
But somehow I cant seem to stay away
I dont want to sound desperate, but I am
So say that youll come around
Guess I should erase and rewind
Erase, erase and rewind

Guess I should leave this behind
Guess I should erase and rewind
But somehow I cant seem to stay away
I dont want to sound desperate, but I am
So say that youll come around
Guess I should erase and rewind
