Th-th-th-this beat is hypnotic
I wanna ride it like a chauffeur
The sound of the sonic's
Controlling me just lika a robot
I go bionic so d-d-dj put in on on
I'm losing logic and cruising deeper in the zone
It's so cinematic charasmatic, it got me frozed up
This acrobatic beat is something I need a dose of
I'm systematically moving every single bone
There's no mechanic that can understand what
I'm on

Chorus:
Let's crank it up
Crank it up
Till the walls cave in
Just crank it up
Crank up
Put the record on spin
'Cause I am ready to party
Gonna get my girls and get naughty 
So crank it up
Crank it up
Till the walls cave in
Just crank it up

Th-th-this beat is melodic harmonic
Got me strinking poses
I get up on it electronically
Feeling so fresh
It's so erotic my body's
Like a cyclone
I'm like a puppet, can't stop it
Dropping like a stone 
It's so cinematic charasmatic, it got me frozed up
This acrobatic beat is something I need a dose of
I'm systematically moving every single bone
There's no mechanic that can understand what
I'm on

Chorus

I systematically move every bone
So crank it up I wanna get in the zone 
I systematically move every bone
So crank it up I wanna get in the zone 

Chorus

I systematically move every bone
So crank it up I wanna get in the zone I systematically move every bone
So crank it up I wanna get in the zone---Lyrics submitted by Rinel.
