Verse 1:
Up above the surface i was just a perfect child
Underneath it all i was craving to be wild
Don't you judge by the cover It's so far from what you see
I'm losing all my patience, waiting on you to believe
I'm suffocating, I can't breath 

Refrain:
Let me out of this cage, i'm not gonna hold on
'Gonna break this chains, i'm taking control
Not gonna give you something to talk about
It's another side of me - I'm acting out

Set me free, i'm ready to show you
This is what i need, it's time to get dirty
I'mma show you what i'm talking about
It's another side of me - I'm acting out

Verse 2:
Welcome to a new beginning, it's time to start the show
No i don't think it matters if it's real or just a role
Once you get a taste of it you'll be begging me for more
I'll give you something to remember once i hit the floor
I'm letting go, of what you know

Refrain:
Let me out of this cage, i'm not gonna hold on
'Gonna break these chains and taking control
Not gonna give you something to talk about
It's another side of me - I'm acting out

Set me free, i'm ready to show you
This is what i need, it's time to get dirty
I'mma show you what i'm talking about
It's another side of me - I'm acting out

Bridge:
I've been waiting just to drive you crazy
Now it's my time and yes it feels amazing
There's nothing left of what you've seen before
Life's too short just to do what you told

Just to do what you told, just to do what you told (Do what you told) just to do what you told, do what - Do what you told

Refrain:
Let me out of this cage, i'm not gonna hold on
'Gonna break this chains, i'm taking control
Not gonna give you something to talk about
It's another side of me - I'm acting out

Set me free, i'm ready to show you
This is what i need, it's time to get dirty
I'mma show you what i'm talking about
It's another side of me - I'm acting out

Life's too short just to do what you told, i'm acting out
Life's too short just to do what you told, i'm acting out
Life's too short just to do what you told, i'm acting out
Yeah yeah, i'm acting out---Lyrics submitted by Rinel.
