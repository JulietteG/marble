Just one more day ,they will stay and they'll play,
in the hay and she'll say that shes yours,

Running through fields then the hills hearing shrills from the bills
of the birds on the moors

This might not of have actually happened
but imagination can be such a good weapon
this might not of have actually happened
but imagination can be such a good weapon for me , for me .

Climbing old trees, picking leaves ,acorn thieves ,making wreaths ,watching bees do their jaws

finding lost streams, misty green shady screen from sunbeams as they dream by the shores.

This might not of have actually happened
but imagination can be such a good weapon
this might not of have actually happened
but imagination can be such a good weapon for me , for me , for me , for me

cynical man do not breathe 
cynical man do not breathe 
cynical man do not breathe 
cynical man do not breathe 

i love my love from here of searching doves, stars above ,show the way that they fall

i love my love from here of searching doves, stars above ,show the way that they fall

This might not of have actually happened
but imagination can be such a good weapon
this might not of have actually happened
but imagination can be such a good weapon---Lyrics submitted by Jeffrey Spragg.
