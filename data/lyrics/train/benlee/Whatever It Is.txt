Are you changing?
Do you know it?
Do you feel it?
Do you know?
But you're waiting
While you're waiting
Why are you waiting?
Just do it - whatever it is

There are secrets
There are places
There are places you can go to
They might tell you
Yeah they'll tell you that you shouldn't
But do it - whatever it is
Go do it - whatever it is
Just do it - whatever it is

And you're dancing
And you're looking kinda crazy
And your arms are making little circles
There are reasons
There are reasons you can find out
So do it - whatever it is
Just do it - whatever it is
Go do it - whatever it is
Whatever it is

It's so quiet
And you're dreaming
I turn to you and say
"Awake is the new sleep"
So wake up
And do it - whatever it is
Just do it - whatever it is

Cos awake is the new sleep
Awake is the new sleep
So wake up
Wake up
And do it - whatever it is
Just do it - whatever it is
Go do it - whatever it is
Just do it - whatever it is
Whatever it is ---Lyrics submitted by Zhang Yang.
