I am just a man
With a name from Japan
In a war like Iran
When they fought, though, I ran
Though I stand, man confused
I don't know who I am
As they tricked me like a scam
Into the army, Uncle Sam
I don't wanna talk about it
Get into it but I'm in it
Born with it like my image as they long for something vintage
Fake games like a scrimmage as I'm pushin' to my limits
I just wanna get up out it like a college but I'm remy
Takin' shots from the rooftop like subliminal
I'm the one shootin' at myself like a criminal
I'm a Flo Rida but I'm something like a Seminole
I'm aimed low man I ain't talkin' about your dinner bro
That's just the start of it
Don't let my family part of it
Influence, truance, in these cuffs that'll scar your wrists
I don't think my heart's in it, it won't get better later
Sorry man I had to let you down like a elevator

No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
I can't get with you
Naw, I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through,
I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
I can't get with you
No, I can't get with you

Pain in my stomach turnin'
Pressure got my heart burnin'
Weird, 'cause the burn of the light doesn't feel as urgent
I remember hazy nights, bass pumpin' head thumpin'
Me extreme goin' off the deep end bungee jumpin'
But the pleasure that I got from that is feelin' like a coffin
That I feel trapped in 'til he came and bought me back
Christ entered in no more me tryna be you
Even more now I'm tryna help you see you
Evil like a serpent, you don't see it but it's certain
Chasin' cars with partitions in the end it's still curtains man
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
But I shaped up, shipped out, in His army now
And He did the work, I just took what he was offerin'
Stopped makin' deals cause he wasn't into bargainin'
And where we come from, we don't have enough to bargain with
So I went all in, matter fact I called it quits

No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
I can't get with you
Naw, I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through,
I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
No I'm done, I'm through
I can't get with you
I can't get with you
No, I can't get with you

I know this sounds strange, morbid to you like a dead body
But I'm somethin' different now get that in your head shawty
I am not a pawn makin' moves like a chess game
I am not who I used to be, yeah a dead man
Resident evil gone, had to find a new home
Sorry that I had to let you down, and leave you alone
Sinnin' it ain't in me matter fact it doesn't master me
Even if I fall, man, the Master's love captured me
Changed like a dolla' I don't want it so I holla'
You will never see me goin' back to it like poppin' collars
So I'm sorry that I had to leave you but I found somethin' better
So I can't be you
And I can't get with ya ---Lyrics submitted by jeff dunham.
