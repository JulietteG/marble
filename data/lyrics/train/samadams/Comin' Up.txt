Yeah! Boston!

Maddie Trump
Yeah!
Uh!

Uh, uh, uh!
I'm comin' up. I'm comin' up on it.
Runnin' airlines from L.A. to Boston.

Can't stop and I told you I promised
That you ain't gon' hear nobody that's hotter.
(hotter)

Hear nobody that's hotter.
Ain't nobody that's hotter.
Nobody hotter.

Ain't nobody that's hotter.
What up haters I'm back so how's my dick taste?
I'm spittin' grimey like months without toothpaste.
Never thought of mixin' blood with my confidence.
See what's in my city, showing love to me's a consequence.

'Cause my wealth's comin' whether not you likin' it.
Feel like the tip of a pin, it's like a counterfit.
Like, your girl ain't ever heard of me. 
Sike! 'Cause she porlly search the world for me.
Ha! Ha, ha! I laugh on tracks.

You, burst veins to go hard 'cause yo ass can't rap.
'Bout to take off, see the stripes and the stars out my window.
Plane flyin' in the air pitck dark.
(pitch dark)
Comin' up.
I'm comin' up on it.
Runnin' airlines from L.A. to Boston.

Can't stop and I told you I promised that you ain't gon' hear nobody that's hotter.
(hotter)
Hear nobody else hotter.
Ain't nobody that's hotter.
Nobody hotter.
Ain't nobody that's hotter.

I told my parents that I was gonna get some.
Up on stage and gettin' higher than a jet son.
I'm getting' love homie, why you never get none?
Born to the game.
Never pose as a step son

I'm that dude on iTunes, what's next?
Shit, rewind a track one time before I exit.
Like I could give a fuck 
Really what y'all think?
Destiny is blessin'.
Bartender gimme a tall drink.
So I can fade out.
Dreams are being played out,  city radio.

I'm good.
And look how good I made out.
Uh!
On dis roll my pops paid, tellin' me to do what I love

So now I'm on stage.
Take a shot son, jus tryne get my own cage.
Comin' up are the number on the fan page

Can't stop 'cause they wanted more than the air waves.
Late night in Boston, West Coast, then to L.A. 
I'm comin' up.
I'm comin' up.

Up on it.
Runnin' airlines from L.A. to Boston.
Can't stop and I told you I promised that you ain't gon' hear nobody that's hotter.
(Hotter)
Hear nobody that's hotter.
Ain't nobody that's hotter.
Nobody hotter.
Ain't nobody that's hotter.

And my skyline's so contagious.
Jet fuel on my tongue and hungover 'cause I'm wasted.
Chewing on success so close I can taste it.
Came too far homie feel like I'ma make it.
Yeah, and you I'm gon' get 'em.
Agencys talkin'.

Never can forget 'em
Slowly movin' strong in positions that I'm winnin'.
Better let 'em know, 
SAMMY ADAMS, YEAH TELL 'EM!

I'm comin' up.
Comin' up on it.
Runnin' airlinds from L.A. to Boston.
Can't stop and I told you I promised that you ain't gon' hear nobody that's hotter.
(Hotter)
Hear nobody that's hotter.
Ain't nobody that's hotter.
Nobody hotter.
Ain't nobody that hotter!---Lyrics submitted by Natalie Garcia.
