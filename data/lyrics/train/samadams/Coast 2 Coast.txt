(Chorus) 
Lifestyle switchin' the illest
Up in the business
I'm hoping to make a killing
And get at me (get at me)
Goin' coast 2 coast
Going coast 2 coast
We going coast 2 coast
Coast 2 coast

I'm not being mean, I'm just being me
Casa Sinatra, get on my team
Girls see me and say "OMG"
He's back on flights going over seas.

Not rich, but aspire to be
Got a new Bentley, but my swagger cheese.
Rather be an ack with a pound of trees
Never been down

And you can not see
Girl problems you think you have some
Hit the beach you won't have none
Big dreams here You Know Platinum

Checks never deposit just cash 'em
Summertime Triple Eight Vodka
Goin' out with my boys lookin' proper
Used to be at the bottom

With the other lobsters
Now I'm in the sky like birds and helicopters.

(Chorus)

On flights traveling to play songs.
Two things Ipod and my Dre's on
Two things on my mind at the same time
Got to go both coasts on the same song
Gotta kill shit, No limit I spit my heart out

'Cause its in this, in the bridges, the beginning
Yeah something like the keys to my ignition
Come fly, yeah get a boarding pass
Too busy all day can't go to class.
Still getting good grade know I'm gonna pass

Hit the West coast I'm leaving mass
Domestic got a press kit
Side life girls impressed with
Girls frontin' like they won't have sex with me?

Haha, yeah right?

(Chorus:x2)---Lyrics submitted by Natalie Garcia.
