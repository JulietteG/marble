Day after day, another minute sold
Day after day, feel the bite from the wind and the cold
Seems fair enough, an even trade
Your time stolen for a minimum wage

Night after night, with no end in sight
Night after night, just in time for the death of the light
The greatest times you've ever known
Never scared, never go it alone
Night after night, this feeling never grows older
Know you could do this over and over and... 

Hey World, you'll never break me
Bring it on, give me your best shot
Hey World, you'll never break me
Try your hardest, try your hardest

Day after day, keeping you awake
Day after day, pushing on just as much as it takes
Feeling worn beyond your age
Is it worth it for a minimum wage?
Night after night, just about to break
Night after night, had as much as a person can take
The best release you've ever known
Never tired, never going home
Night after night, this feeling never grows older
Know you could do this over and over and... 

Hey World, you'll never break me
Bring it on, give me your best shot
Hey World, you'll never break me
Try your hardest, try your hardest

Hey World, you'll never break me
Step it up, give me your best shot
Hey World, you'll never break me
Try your hardest, try your hardest

Tonight's our night, we'll never go it alone
Tonight's our night, we're never going home
With the greatest friends I swear I've known
Yeah

Hey World, you'll never break me
Bring it on, give me your best shot
Hey World, you'll never break me
Try your hardest, try your hardest

Hey World, you'll never break me
Step it up, give me your best shot
Hey World, you'll never break me
Try your hardest, try your hardest---Lyrics submitted by Brodie.
