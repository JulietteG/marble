[verse 1] 
it's Casely 
I'm tryna find you,tryna reach out to you girl 
Oh, cuz I wrote you lettaz, I sent you e-mails 
And I haven't heard back from you, Oh 
When your not around I get so lonely for you baby 

My life is just an open book 
and when you read my lines of my mind 
I'm hoping you take much more than a 2nd look 
to find out what is inside 
cuz it's more than just some silly rhyme 
It's really more like my hearts bleeding words for a 1000x 

[chorus] 

the minutes feel like hours 
the hours feel like days 
I just can't concentrate 
when your not around 
the day moves oh so slow 
when im at work I can't wait to go home 
I walk down a lonely road 
when your not around 

[verse 2] 

Remember when you always say 
that with out you girl I'd be okay 
oh but those words weren't true 
girl no matter what you say I still need you 
cuz I want you by my side 
and if it's up to me it would be tonight 
I'm just a man so in love reaching out 
girl I need your touch 

[chorus] 

the minutes feel like hours 
the hours feel like days 
I just can't concentrate 
when your not around 
the day moves oh so slow 
when im at work I can't wait to go home 
I walk down a lonely road 
when your not around 

[bridge] 

I just can't wait until the day 
when you come back my way 
girl I'm missing you 
I, I cant stand the pain oh 
I guess...I guess it's will take some time 

[chorus] 

the minutes feel like hours 
the hours feel like days 
I just can't concentrate 
when your not around 
the day moves oh so slow 
when im at work I can't wait to go home 
I walk down a lonely road 
when your not around---Lyrics submitted by Darien.
