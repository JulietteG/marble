looking for owls?
the young man asked
hoping to lighten the tension
the scowl he received
as his only reply
made him smile
as he relived the mention 
and the coward fool
who walked on alone
caught pride 
in the fear he instilled 
but later they found him
tied to a log
bent over
and buffalo billed 

buffalo bill, buffalo bill

buffalo bill, buffalo bill

buffalo bill, buffalo bill

buffalo bill, buffalo bill---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
