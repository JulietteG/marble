We're glad glad glad that you're alive
We're glad glad glad that you'll arrive
And we're glad glad glad glad glad glad glad
And we're glad glad glad that you're a glide

We're glad glad glad that you're alive
We're glad glad glad that you'll arrive
And we're glad glad glad glad glad glad glad
And we're glad glad glad that you're a glide

And we're glad glad glad that you're alive
And we're glad glad glad that you'll arrive
And we're glad glad glad glad glad glad glad
And we're
Glad glad glad that you're a 
Glide---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
