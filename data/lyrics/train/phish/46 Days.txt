Lee Foldem's soul made out
46 days 'til the coal ran out
Please come 'round here another day
Sit yourself down when you're ready to stay
She dug down when they took the town
Looking for clues but they couldn't be found
Lee found out she was ready roll
47 days and the coal came home

Taste the fear
For the devil's drawing near
Taste the fear
For the devil's drawing near

46 days and the coal ran out
46 days and the coal ran out---Lyrics submitted by Jerry H.
