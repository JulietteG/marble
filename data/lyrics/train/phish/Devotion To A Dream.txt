No more promises
That no one could keep
No more lies
To keep us from sleep

No more phone calls (it's today the vows are broken)
Where you don't say what you mean 
(it's today that webs were woven)
(it's today the time to turn around)

I've got faith, in a fairy tale (tomorrow I can cross the border)
Devotion to a dream (it's today a new world order)
(yesterday my doors were closing down)

No more knowing glances
Or places we can hide
No more chances
To keep this thing alive

The two of us together
It wasn't in the grand scheme
All it was was a fairy tale and
Devotion to a dream

Devotion to a dream

No more wondering
What do I stay here for
No more promises
No more keeping score

We broke the awkward silence with
Polite but practiced lies
The two of us rehearsing our goodbyes

A long and fruitless journey that
Stranded us upstream
All it was was a fairy tale
And devotion to a dream

It's today a new world order
It's today we cross the border
It's today the time to turn around---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
