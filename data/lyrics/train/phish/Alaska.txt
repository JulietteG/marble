I always had to tell her to relax(that's right)
I always had to tell her to relax(say it three times)
I always had to tell her to relax

And the cat can slip indoors
Through multitudes of cracks
It's funny what they'll do
The cracks lead outside to
When I asked her where she was going 
She said far away from you

Stuck here on my own now
Digging down deep
I don't understand it
But I ain't losing sleep
I'm not gonna lay down
Head north out of town

I don't know but I think I'll go 
And try dog mushing with an Eskimo

In Alaska Alaska 
I think I'll try Alaska 
Somewhere she could wait for me
I'll catch up just wait 'n' see
Idaho Nebraska 
I don't know Alaska 

I think I'll try
I think I'll try Alaska

I sold my old piano for the rent
Loaded up on bug spray 
I Found my daddies tent
Now I'm in a high gear doing forty-five 
Humming a tune I won't see the moon 
'Til sometime in July

I guess I could have flown or toke a train
But you won't see a Moose if you're sitting on a plane
Now there's no more room
I've got a line load
If she isn't in Alaska 
I'll stay and pan for gold

Alaska Alaska
I think I'll try Alaska
Somewhere she could wait for me
I'll catch up just wait and see
Idaho Nebraska 
I don't know Alaska 

I think I'll try 
I think I'll try Alaska 

Just when I thought I'd end up alone
Big ol' 'laskan momma comes walking down the road

Alaska Alaska
I'll stay right here in Alaska
All settled down and having fun
Here in the land of the midnight sun
Is it time to call the Pastor 
I don't know I'll ask her

I'll stay right here
I'll stay right here

I'll stay right here
I'll stay right here

I'll stay right here
I'll stay right here

I'll stay right here
I'll stay right here---Lyrics submitted by jerry.
