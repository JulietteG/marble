In the silence of the garden 
Moss arizing on the wind 
And the beast is pondering love love love 
'Till the rusty nail grow dim 

(Chorus) 
I can't seem to make you mine 
Through the long and lonely night 
And I try so hard, darling 
But the crowd pulled you away 
Through the rhythm and the rain 
And the ivy coiled around my hand 

So I lingered with the people 
In the silent August glade 
But the rain has brought the night 
And the night has brought the rain 

(Repeat Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by LINDA.
