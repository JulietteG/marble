Young men please be careful with
The young ladies
Don't do the things
You know guys do
Cause shes growing up and showing it
You know she believes
So don't make it harder than it have to be
Don't let nobody, Treat her rough
Be the one, To back her up
Weither she do or don't put out


Tell her that she's, 
Wonderful, Beautiful, Fabulous 
Tell her that she's,
Got someone to stand by for the roads
Tell her that she's,
Everything you pried for and even more you adore her
In and out of clothes shes your Ghetto Rose

Grown men please be careful with your own ladies
Don't do the things you know guys do
If there's anyway to you gonna keep a family
And everything that's precious to you
Don't ever ever treat her rough
Be the one to lift her up
And don't you ever shut her out


Tell her that's she's
Wonderful, Beautiful, Fabulous
Tell her that she's 
Got someone to stand by for the roads 
Tell her that's she's
Everything you pried for and even more you adore her
In and out of clothes she's your Ghetto Rose (x2)

Cherish Her (oooooooooo)
Love Her (Ghetto Rose)
When times get hard. Oh baby
Love Her (Oh Oh)
Cherish her ( When she needs you most)
When she needs you mooost


Tell her that's she's
Wonderful, Beautiful, Fabulous
Tell her that she's 
Got someone to stand by for the roads 
Tell her that's she's
Everything you pried for and even more you adore her
In and out of clothes she's your Ghetto Rose---Lyrics submitted by Erin.
