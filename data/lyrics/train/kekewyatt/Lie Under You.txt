I'm laying in the back of my daddy's old pick-up truck
Looking up in the sky at the stars, all I see is you
In, I find myself in a room, sitting here
With the blues, cause I want, all I want is you

You're like a bottle of wine
You get better in time, all I need
Is a glass of you
You're like a 'rise and shine'
And in time
All I wanna do is lie under you

I'm in my living room, talking to my momma
And all I can do is think of you
I'm in my kitchen, frying up an egg
As I'm baking all I can do is think of you

You're like a bottle of wine
You get better in time, all I need
Is a glass of you
You're like a 'rise and shine'
And in time
All I wanna do is lie under you

In time, stand still whenever you're near
I can't breath, I can't sleep, I can't eat,
I can't think, when you're not around

You're like a bottle of wine
You get better in time, all I need
Is a glass of you
You're like a 'rise and shine'
And in time
All I wanna do is lie under you ---
