Lord found a clay and i've been
left out in the sun..
crack and dry from the mud from a sty
still clinging to the prodigal son..

now i'm on my way back home..
yes i'm on my way back home..
into the Hands
that made the wine from the water..
into the Hands..the Hands of the Potter

lord found the clay
and let your living water flow
soften up my edges Lord,
so everyone will know

that i'm on my way back home..
yes i'm on my way back home..
into the Hands
that made the wine from the water..
into the Hands..the Hands of the Potter

Lord when you listen for the
song of my life..
let it be, let it be, song so sweet
let it be, let it be, song so sweet
let it be...

Lord found the clay and laid me down
on the spinning wheel..
shape me into something you can feel
with something real

i'll be on my way back home
yes i'm on my way back home
into the Hands
that made the wine from the water..
into the Hands..the Hands of the Potter

into the Hands
that made the wine from the water..
into the Hands..the Hands of the Potter---Lyrics submitted by denise.
