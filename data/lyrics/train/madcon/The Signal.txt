[Intro: Yosef]
You sending me signals
I send them back to you
I send them back

[Verse 1: Tshawe]
Out of sight, out of mind
Came out of nowhere, started to shine
My eyes they can't take it
Who loves somebody saying it?
You got me weasel from the smoke the way that you set my soul on fire
And the signals I'm sending
Read the signals I'm sending

[Hook: Tshawe]
It don't say stop, it don't say no
I'm sending a call out, I want you to know
Pick it up
I'm sending L-O-V-E
Sending L (sending) O (sending) V-E

[Bridge: Yosef]
You sending me signals, I send them back
Don't take a rocket scientist to see that you sending me signals
I send them back to you
I send them back

[Verse 2: Tshawe]
Oh my god you're redifined
Are you an illusion? Are you a sign?
Please somebody tell me
Are the heavens speaking to me? Yeah
If you're my Venus then forgive me if I can't take my eyes off you
The signals you're sending
I'm reading the signals you're sending

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Yosef]
Just know the reason I'm always feeding signs you
I'm always trying to read to see if what you sending me is true

[Hook]

[Outro: Yosef]
