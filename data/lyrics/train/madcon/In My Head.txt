I let you go
First day, fourth month of the year
I said I never regret nothing
but these empty bags make's me want you here

I see you smile
But if somebody else that has you laughing
I guess I didn't think it was serious
And now I wonder do you still think of us

You're in my head
wish I knew how to get you out
I was trying to give you up, but just for love
I'm missing you being around ( x2 )

You're in my head
( I can't let you go) ( x4 )

I wanna fight
Cause It's holding you the way that I used too
I'm playing of like It's nothing
but I'm burning of and im about too loose my cool

I'm not gonna lie
Girl the truth is that I'm in love with you
That alone has to mean something
if you don't feel the same, take a walk in my shoes
Baby I miss you

You're in my head
wish I knew how to get you out
I was trying to give you up, but just for love
I'm missing you being around ( x2 )

You're in my head
( I can't let you go) ( x4 )

You see life goes on
I know I can't turn back time but I wish I
never stop trying resist what I'm feeling

But without you life is a bitch
go get her my head needs space
minds open needs a session street
I'm sending you one-way ticket out of my head

You're in my head
wish I knew how to get you out
I was trying to give you up, but just for love
I'm missing you being around ( x2 )

You're in my head
( I can't let you go) ( x4 )

You're in my head
wish I knew how to get you out
I was trying to give you up, but just for love
I'm missing you being around ( x2 )

You're in my head---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
