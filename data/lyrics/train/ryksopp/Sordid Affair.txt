There was a time, dark and divine
Exciting and new, shameful untrue
Free to explore, we had it all
Towering trust, insatiable lust
Clouding the truth both of us knew
This sordid affair is ending in tears
Yes, we must go on knowing the wrong
Hunting the day it was taken away

Oh, all of our love fell down to earth
Here, broken and cold, with great remorse
Before a while it all made sense
It might have been just a dark pretense
But you had me and I left it
To be with you, to be the one
To live a lie, it really got me all excited
I felt wanted

Then in the dark a sorrowing sigh
Was taken away, deliverance came
Fell from the sky, heaven replied
Salvation in strings, silent and clean
All that we were, all that we knew
Faded away with tears in the rain
Yes, all that we were, all that we knew
Is fading away like tears in the rain

All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away

All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away---
