[OK]
Only this moment... holds us together
Close to perfection... nothing else out there
No one to guide us... lost in our senses
Deep down inside I know our love will die [OK]

Only this moment... holds us together
Lost in confusion... feelings are out there
Scared of devotion... doubting intentions
Deep down inside I know our love will die

Stay or forever go
Play or you'll never know
What heaven decided
You can't deny it's all you've been waiting for

[OK]

Stay or forever go
Play or you'll never know
Your spirit's divided
You will decide if I'm all you've been waiting for

Clouds in my head have been parted with grace
By the voice of an angel revealing her face
And her words they make sense and I do understand
Falling in love isn't part of a plan

Forces within me mix reason with lust
But I'll try to accept it and not make it worse
'Cause I know I might lose it by taking the chance
But love without pain isn't really romance [OK]

Only this moment... holds us together
Close to perfection... nothing else out there
Always beside her... trusting my senses
Deep down inside I know love will survive

Only this moment... holds us together
Close to perfection... nothing else out there
Always beside her... trusting my senses
Deep down inside I know love will survive [OK]---Lyrics submitted by James.
