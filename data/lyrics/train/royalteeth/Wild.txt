Dont you think its time for you and me to make some history
Tell me now what you say cause we can take anything
Just because were growing up, it doesnt mean weve had enough
When times are hard well smile and say, were not afraid of anything

(cause we feel young and wild)
I believe that I can make you scream
I believe that I can make you scream
For me

Help me see everything we used to be
We wont forget
The lives we lived, the loves we chased
We lost the things we cant replace

(when we were young and wild)
I believe that I can make you scream
I believe that I can make you scream
For me

I believe that I can make you scream
I believe that I can make you scream
For me---Lyrics submitted by harith wafi.
