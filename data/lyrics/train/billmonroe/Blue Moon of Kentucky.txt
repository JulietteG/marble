Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and proved and true
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

It was on one moonlight night
The stars shining bright
And they whispered from on high
"Your love has said goodbye"

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said goodbye

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and proved and true
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

It was on one moonlight night
The stars shining bright
They whispered from high
"Your love has said goodbye"

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Dalton.
