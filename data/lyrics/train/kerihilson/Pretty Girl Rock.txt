Rock to the pretty girl rock rock rock
Now what's your name

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly oh my is a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry looking at my deri
And you can stare but if you touch then ima beri

Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a s
Mad cause I'm cuter than the girl as with ya
I ain't gotta talk about it baby you can see it
But if you want ill be happy to repeat it

And you can stare but if you touch it ima beri

Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad cause I'm cuter than the girl as with ya

I can talk about it cause I know that I'm pretty
If you know it too then ladies sing it with me

All eyes on me when I walk in,
No question that this girl's a 10
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful.
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful.

Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful

If your looking for me you can catch me
Cameras flashing, daddies turned his head as soon as I passed him
Girls think I'm conceded cause I think I'm attraction
Don't worry about what I think why don't you ask him
Owoaah!

Get yourself together don't hate, jealous is the ugliest trait
I can talk about it cause I know that I'm pretty
If you know it too then ladies sing it with me

All eyes on me when I walk in,
