Okay, boys
Class is now in session
Lesson's one through forever
Always give us what we want

This for my ladies who ain't gon' wake up for no man
I hope these fellas get it, I hope they understand
Understand the woman is the boss
And if they don't get-get it, tell em'-tell 'em to get lost
Where my sexy, sexy fellas wit' that money in they pocket
Who can make me-make me holla, keep me screamin' like an opera (oh)
Yeah, I know you want this body, you like the way I flaunt
So boy, don't hesitate, gi-gi-gi-gimme what I want

I'm hollerin' boy, don't tease me
Gimme-gimme what I want
Gimme-gimme what I want
Gimme-gimme what I want
Yeah, yeah, yeah, boy, don't tease me
Gimme what I want
Gi-gi-gi-gimme what I want

Put it down on me now
Up, down, round and round
Put it down on me now
Boy, don't tease me
Gi-gimme what I want
Gimme-gimme what I want

This for my ladies who ain't gon' wake up for no n*gga
Who know that when they want it, they gon' shoot it, 
Pull the trigger (Pow, pow, pow)
Pull the trigger, yeah ladies, shoot 'em up
Turn into Killa Keri wit' that drink up in my cup
Where my sexy, sexy fellas wit' that money in they pocket
Who can make-make-make me holla, keep me screamin' like an opera(oh)
