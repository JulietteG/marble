Ohhhh yeah

You know that I love you
You know that I love you

You know that I need you
Youre my every, I breathe you

You know that I love you 
You know that I love you 

You know that I need you 
Youre my every, I breathe you

So dont try to change me 
So dont try to change me

Why would you change me?
Why would you change me?
 (Baby I will let you go)

So dont try to change me
So dont try to change me 

Why would you change me? 
Why would you change me?
(Baby I will let you go)

You know why
I had my, my boy said
You said you could handle it
But you lied, cause you tried
 To change me, move 
Me and nooo

Everything you loved before
You dont love no more
Everything I did for you 
You dont want no more

Maybe im not the fallin 
Love youre been looking for
Would you agree? 
So how can you not see it?

You know that I love you 
You know that I love you 

You know that I need you 
Youre my every I breathe you

You know that I love you 
You know that I love you 

You know that I need you
Youre my every, I breathe you

So dont try to change me
So dont try to change me

Why would you change me?
Why would you change me?
(Baby I will let you go)

Why must I decide on?
Whether I love you or the world
You met me, you fell
Deeply in love with me
So what is the problem now?

Everything you loved before
You dont love no more
Everything I did for you 
You dont want no more

Maybe im not quite the man
You been looking for
Would you agree?
So how can you not see it?

You know that I love you
You know that I love you

You know that I need you
Youre my every, I breathe you

You know that I love you 
You know that I love you 

You know that I need you 
Youre my every, I breathe you

So dont try to change me 
So dont try to change me

Why would you change me?
Why would you change me?
 (Baby I will let you go)

So dont try to change me
So dont try to change me 

Why would you change me? 
Why would you change me?
(Baby I will let you go)

Why would you wanna change me
Arrange me, is that what you call love
Maybe you need somebody different
Somebody who fits you like a glove
But dont change everything that you love
About me when you know

You know that I love you
You know that I love you

You know that I need you
Youre my every, I breathe you

You know that I love you 
You know that I love you 

You know that I need you 
Youre my every, I breathe you

So dont try to change me 
So dont try to change me

Why would you change me?
Why would you change me?
 (Baby I will let you go)

So dont try to change me
So dont try to change me 

Why would you change me? 
Why would you change me?
