Heh.. not again..
Ohh.. this aint supposed to happen to me..

[Kanye West]
Keep rockin, and keep knockin
Whether you Louie Vouitonn it up or Reebokin
You see the hate, that theyre servin on a platter
So what we gon have - dessert or disaster?

[Keri Hilson]
I never thought Id.. be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in.. and knocked me on my face
Feels like in Im a race
but I already won first place

I never thought Id fall for you as hard as I did
(as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinkin bout our life our house and kids (yeah)
Every mornin I look at you and smile
cause boy you came around and you knocked me down.. knocked me down

[Chorus]
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around love comes around)
and it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
and it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(knocks you down)

[Ne-Yo]
I never thought Id
hear myself say (ooh)
Yall gon head
I think Im gonna kick it wit my girl today (kick it wit my girl today)
I used to be commander and chief
of my pimp ship flyin high (flyin high)
til i met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (ohhh shot me out the sky)

Hey, now Im crashing, dont know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could back, and make it happen faster
Dont you know I would baby if I could
Miss independent (ohh, to the fullest), the load never too much
she helpin me pull it
she shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to u the pimp in me just died tonight,
girl sometimes love

[Keri Hilson]

[Chorus]
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
and it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
and it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(knocks you down)

[Kanye West]
Tell me now can you make it past your caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA
you was always the cheerleader of my dreams that
seem to only date the head of football teams
and I was the class clown that, always kept you laughin
We, were never meant to be baby we just happen
so please, dont mess up the trick.. hey young world Im the new slick rick
they say I move too quick, but we can't let the moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask, someone thats only average
For advice
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Whoa its me
Baby this is tragic
Cause we had it, we was magic


I was flyin, now Im crashin
this is bad, real bad, michael jackson
now Im mad, real mad, joe jackson
you should leave your boyfriend now, Imma ask him

[Keri Hilson]
Say u gotta put the good with the bad, happy and the sad
So will u bring a better future than I had in the past
oh Cause, I dont wanna make the same mistakes I did
I dont wanna fall back on my face again
Whoaa, whoaaa
Ill admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
Whoaa, whoaaa
and if it hits better make it worth the fall

(When it comes around)

[Chorus]
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
and it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
and it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(knocks you down)

Wont see it coming when it happens (hey)
but when it happens youre gonna feel it, let me tell you now
you see when love knocks you down

Wont see it coming when it happens
but when it happens youre gonna feel it, let me tell you now
you see when love knocks you down
yeah---Lyrics submitted by Tamara.
