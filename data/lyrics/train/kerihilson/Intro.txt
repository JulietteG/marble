Oooo Oooo
(We 'bout to get it poppin')

Oooo Oooo
(We 'bout to get it poppin')

Oooo Oooo
Now take it to the floor
I know you like it so tell
the DJ keep it rockin' like

Oooo Oooo
I know you heard of me
Interscope gave me the deal
Soon as they got word of me

Oooo Oooo
Baby please understand
Can't have you all up on
me I roll with some killers man

Oooo Oooo
Polow and Timbaland
I'm in the middle like Mody
They just my homies man

Oooo Oooo
I see her muggin me
She don't want no problems
I got a lil' bit of thug in me

Oooo Oooo
(We 'bout to get it poppin')

Oooo Oooo
(We 'bout to get it poppin')

Oooo Oooo
Now take it to the floor
I know you like it so tell
the DJ keep it rockin' like

Oooo Oooo
(We 'bout to get it poppin')

Oooo Oooo
(We 'bout to get it poppin')

Oooo Oooo
Now take it to the floor
Move it don't stop it
Now tell the Dj keep it rockin like

Oooo Oooo
ATL born and raised
Too many claimin the A
Ain't really from the A

Oooo Oooo
Just saying what I feel
rep where you from not where you live
baby keep it real

Oooo Oooo
You look like you new to this
Don't even have it cuz you don't know what to do with this
(You's a rookie)

Oooo Oooo
Henny And Apple Juice
That's what you give me
if you really tryin to get me loose

Oooo Oooo
Thank you for turnin me on---Lyrics submitted by Natasha.
