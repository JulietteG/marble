Why do our failures seem to have a voice
They say we're lost and we don't have a choice
Theyre telling us that we're not capable
They say our prison's inescapable

Stand up now
They can't hold us down
Stand up now
Get up off the ground

Why does our brokenness keep whispering
Its telling us that we're not anything
I say no fall is going to keep us out
This fear is something we'll forget about

Chorus

Bridge:
Were fallen  it can't hold us down
These failures  they hold us down
Were broken  they can't hold us down
Were fallen  get up off the ground---Lyrics submitted by Olivia.
