[Kelly]
Yo,have u ever thought about being with me?
Naw,i dont being wit be like just being wit me

& nobody else can match the feelings that u have for me
& the love that we share,is so undeniable
Cuz this is how i feel about you

[Chorus]
My lady u know i love her
Nothin else in this world that comes before her
Cuz shes my favorite girl i keep her laid so properly
& yet i let her push the ride cuz she ride for me
