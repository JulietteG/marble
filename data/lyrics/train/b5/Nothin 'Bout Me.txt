Verse 1: Dusitn]
Your friends say i just a player
But girl i'm just tryna love you (love u)
We've been together for so long
Why would i wanna do you wrong

[Bridge: Carnell]
Girl they don't know nothin bout me
What will it take you to see
That my love is true (and only for you)
Girl don't know what else i can say 
My heart is in the right place 
I live for you (you know that i do)

[Chorus:]
They say that i hurt you
They say i don't deserve you
But they don't know nothin bout me 
No they don't know nothin bout me
Your girls are hatin
I can't believe what their sayin
'cause they don't know nothin bout me
No they don't know nothin bout me

You know when we are together 
All we can see is eachother
We both know that they just jelious
