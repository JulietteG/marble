[Lil B:]
I waited for you
I waited for your call
You aint never got time for me
But you always at the mall
I sick and tired of the games you play with me
Can't take this attitude acting rude that's not cool with me

[Chorus:]
Girl i'm sick and tired of the games you play
And the things you say and the things you do
Girl i'm sick and tired of you
Girl i'm sick and sick and tired of you
So step now baby
Now that i know that your full of games
And you'll never change you'll remain the same
Girl i'm sick and tired of you
Girl i'm sick and sick and tired of you
So step now baby

[Carnell:]
I don't know what's up with you
Girl you act so wack with me
If it's all bout a nother dude
Then you sould have kept it real with me
Shorty wipe those tears away 
'cause my mides made up so step now baby
Go ahead with the games you play
Your on your way 'cause your not the one for me

[Chorus (Carnell):]
Girl i'm sick and tired of the games you play (girl your not the one for me)
And the things you say and the things you do
Girl i'm sick and tired of you
Girl i'm sick and sick and tired of you
So step now baby (girl i'm tired of playing games)
Now that i know that your full of games
And you'll never change you'll remain the same (woooo)
Girl i'm sick and tired of you
Girl i'm sick and sick and tired of you
So step now baby (so step now baby)

Girl i'm sick and tired of the games you play 
And the things you say and the things you do (and the things you say and the things you do)
Girl i'm sick and tired of you
Girl i'm sick and sick and tired of you (girl i'm sick and tired of you)
So step now baby (you'll never change)
Now that i know that your full of games (baby)
And you'll never change you'll remain the same (oh)
Girl i'm sick and tired of you
Girl i'm sick and sick and tired of you
So step now baby (so step now baby)

[Carnell's lil rap:]
You had your chance 
And now it's over with me and now you come
Around cryin to me all i wanted was time with you 
I get tired of your attitude. they say that out of sight is out of mind 
And i'm not gonna let you waste my time
What more don't you understand
That's it call it quits so step now baby.

[Chorus (Lil B):]
Girl i'm sick and tired of the games you play (girl i'm sick and tired of you)
And the things you say and the things you do
Girl i'm sick and tired of you
Girl i'm sick and sick and tired of you (oh)
So step now baby (oh)
Now that i know that your full of games
And you'll never change you'll remain the same
Girl i'm sick and tired of you( getting sick and tired of you)
Girl i'm sick and sick and tired of you
So step now baby

Girl i'm sick and tired of the games you play (oh)
And the things you say and the things you do(oh)
Girl i'm sick and tired of you
Girl i'm sick and sick and tired of you (i'm sick and tired of you)
So step now baby
Now that i know that your full of games
And you'll never change you'll remain the same (you aint never gonna change)
