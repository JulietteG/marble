Running my mouth like a cold milk spilling,
your feet stood still but your heart wasnt in it.
The old and rush mine might be rushing next year
in a few months baby while I move you down here.
Early in the morning took the Santa Fe train
with some worn out shoes and a leather suitcase.

I love you in the morning, 
I need you in the evening,
thinking about you every night and day.
When I get the money, 
while hit the ground running,
ive got a feeling that our luck its gonna change, 
my sweet Loraine

Told you money would be raining from the sky, 
but the sun dark cold in the money just that.
Ill be leaving California real soon, 
babe I am coming home to you. 
I read in the paper uncle Sam missed me, 
so I took a deep breath, and I join the army. 
Settled two and two in Europe one day 
with a wife and a kid and another on the way.

I love you in the morning, 
I need you in the evening,
thinking about you every night and day.
When I get the money, 
while hit the ground running,
ive got a feeling that our luck its gonna change, 
my sweet Loraine

This just Julie Ill be home in a week 
while takes this government checks and I will put them in the bank. 
Ten years later I bought an eighty eight spread 
and a truck full of seed and we tailed the land,
I was a dreamer in the rain and the shine 
when the dust ball came and it rubbed us blind

I love you in the morning, 
I need you in the evening,
thinking about you every night and day.
When I get the money, 
while hit the ground running,
ive got a feeling that our luck its gonna change, 

cos theres something you need to know, 
there are a honey but the golds, 
there is no one you love the pays 
other ones you hate the most.

I took a polize all of my life, 
well I hooKed to complaining one day when I buy, 
65 rents should be coming in your name, 
well im sorry for the pay, 
but its easy all this way.

My sweet Loraine. 
My sweet Loraine, 
My sweet Loraine, 
My sweet Loraine, 
My sweet Loraine.---Lyrics submitted by Rohah.
