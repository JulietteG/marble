Written in Cody, Wyoming

You picked a little flower now what's in your hand?
Dazzled by the sunset but you don't own the sand
Questions that never ask why
The little song bird don't fly
So afraid of falling
But nothing really works out so bad.

Your feet are kinda tired but you don't feel the street
War drums pounding but you don't hear the beat
And the words they come from your hand
You're flat on your back when you stand
You say it's overloaded
But nothing really works out so bad.

Milk for the baby but there's nothing to drink
Thoughts are a churning but no time to think
There's a blind girl begging for fame
And silver arrows cast blame
We're all accused of something
But nothing really works out so bad.

People kept trying to have it their way
But what's good wasn't always right
Whistle in the wind with nothing to say
Darker than the brightest light.

Questions that never ask why
The little song bird don't fly
So afraid of falling
But nothing really works out so bad.

There's a blind girl begging for fame
And silver arrows cast blame
We're all accused of something
But nothing really works out so bad.
All accused of something
But nothing really works out so bad.
All accused of something
But nothing really works out so bad.
