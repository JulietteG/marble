New Day Coming
Written by: W. Dire Wolff - 10/15/03

Hey Good People!
Come on gather 'round
Another new days coming
That's why I've come to town
I've been up all night
Why should I be down?
When a new days coming
Come on gather 'round

Don't worry about the night
It's gonna be alright
Come that morning light.

Another new day coming
Come and you will see
Another new day coming
Come on follow me
cuz It's all right here,
Not across the sea
Another new day coming
Come on follow me.

Don't worry about the night
It's gonna be alright
Come that morning light.

Another new day coming
Come on gather 'round
Another new day coming
That's why I've come to town
I've been up all night
Why should I be down?
When a new day's coming
Come on gather 'round

Don't worry about the night
It's gonna be alright
Come that morning light.
