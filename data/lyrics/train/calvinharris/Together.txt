(feat. Gwen Stefani)

Always running from what feels right
Too fast and I didn't know
Then a minute turns to daylight
You're here, no way to let go
Don't look back, when you're holding me
'Cause I know what this love was meant to be

One day
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms

We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
As we wake up together

I got something and it feels right
What I needed to be
Can't control what you feel for me
I was watching you the whole night
I can never explain how the magic was made
Don't look back, when you're holding me
'Cause I know what this love was meant to be

One day
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my 

We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
As we wake up together

One day
you won't wanna go home
And it feels so good in my arms
You won't wanna go home
As we wake up together---
