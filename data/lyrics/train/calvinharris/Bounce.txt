(feat. Kelis)

I can't believe that every day and every night
Its getting better with you out of my life
Its like I flicked a switch and now Im feeling good
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes I know I'll feel alive
You will be the last thing on my mind
No regrets, do you know what that means?

It's hot, it's now, it's when
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

I can love again tonight
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

Bounce, bounce, bounce

It's, it's now, it's when
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that ---Lyrics submitted by Devid Jonson.
