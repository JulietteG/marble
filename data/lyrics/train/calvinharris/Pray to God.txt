(feat. HAIM)

Oh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just dont know anymore
I pray to God, I just dont know anymore
Anymore

I lost the feeling but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just dont know anymore

When theres no getting through
I wont hold back
I will throw down anything in life, I know now
Ive been lying on the floor
Sleeping on the ground
I will give up everything in life, I know how

'Cause I cant stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
Id look up to the sky

And give in
Id give in
Id give in
Id give into you
Give into you

Oh, when the moon was shining bright before morning
I made a deal with the stars to keep holding
Shining bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
The visions in my mind are enough to keep me from fear
I wont let it hold me down
The other way around
I dont want the words to, I cant make a sound

'Cause I cant stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
Id look up to the sky

And give in
Id give in
Id give in
Id give into you
Give into you

Cant hold back reaching out
(Hot, hot, hot)
I was living in the heat of the moment
Between us I told you that
(Hot, hot, hot)
I was living in the heat of the moment

Id give in
(Hot, hot)
I was living in the heat of the moment
Id give in
(Hot, hot)
I was living in the heat of the moment
Id give in
(Hot, hot)
I was living in the heat of the moment
Id give into to you
Give into you

Id give in
Id give in
Id give in
Id give into you
Give into you

Id give in
Id give in
Id give in
Id give into you
Give into you---
