(feat. Stine Bramsen)

It wouldn't stop raining as we sat in the cold
32 daughters and sons
Everyone just waiting at the spot as we were told
Cause we were the abandoned ones

How many times do I have to say
There is a light ahead
Soon there'll be nobody left out there to save

We give up to get by
Our dreams, our voices
We give up without cries
Or scream under water

It wouldn't stop raining as you sat in the cold
32 daughters and sons
Everyone just waiting at the spot as you were told
Cause you were the obedient ones

How many times do you have to say
You see a light ahead
Soon there'll be nobody left out here to save

We give up to get by
Our dreams, our voices
We give up without cries
Or scream under water

We're rising up
We're rising up
Our dreams, our voices
We're rising up
We're rising up
Until the dawn has broken

We're badly bruised but we're not broken
Badly bruised but not broken
We're badly bruised but we're not broken

We give up to get by
Our dreams, our voices
We give up without cries
Or scream under water

We're rising up
We're rising up
Our dreams, our voices
We're rising up
We're rising up
Until the dawn has broken---
