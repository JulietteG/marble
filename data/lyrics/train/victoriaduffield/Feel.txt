Been there, d-d-done it, its the same every day
D-d-dont you, dont you want it, dont you want it to change?
Im on automatic, and Im about to ignite
Theres something deep inside you, wanna set it on fire

Music is hypnotic, move your body, you got it
When the rhythm takes over, you let it, just let go
Love is hypnotic, euphoric, exotic
So when you get the shot out, you gotta take it

I want you to feel, the way that I feel
Tonight I feel like everything that we ever dreamed
Its not as hard as it seems to make it real
But I want you to feel
I want you to feel

Can you feel the rush like youre electric inside?
M-m-moving through our lovers, its a serious vibe
Better take a chance, you know I wont ask you twice
Feel the fever rising baby, this is your life

Music is hypnotic, move your body, you got it
When the rhythm takes over, you let it, just let go
Love is hypnotic, euphoric, exotic
So when you get the shot out, you gotta take it

I want you to feel, the way that I feel
Tonight I feel like everything that we ever dreamed
Its not as hard as it seems to make it real
I want you to feel, the way that I feel
Tonight I feel like
I, I got the music inside and I feel so alive, its so unreal
But I want you to feel

If you dont know where to start
Listen to your heart and feel your way

Feel, feel, I want you to feel, feel...

I want you to feel, oh, the way that I feel
Tonight I feel like everything that we ever dreamed
Its not as hard as it seems to make it real
I want you to feel, oh, the way that I feel
Tonight I feel like
I, I got the music inside and I feel so alive, its so unreal
But I want you to feel

Just let go, let go, let go, feel!---
