Broken glass
Broken heart
There's a picture of you laying on the floor
Empty space on the wall
While I am staring at
Wishing that you'd call
Cause every time you call me up
I'm reminded of the pain you caused
Can't move on it's so hard
When you keep on coming back for more

[Chorus:]
It's time for me to say
I know you're only gonna break my heart
You're getting in the way
I should've seen this coming right from the start
So baby don't come around anymore
Or you'll be standing outside my front door
So listen as I say
Baby I'm tearing us apart
Cause you're only gonna break my heart
I'm tearing us apart
You're only gonna break my heart
I'm tearing us apart

Everyday it's the same I keep seeing you
I keep hearing your name
And I know that one day
I'll get over you and I'll be ok
But every time you call me up
I'm reminded of all the pain you caused
Can't move on, it's so hard
When you keep on coming back for more

[Chorus:]
It's time for me to say
I know you're only gonna break my heart
You're getting in the way
I should've seen this coming right from the start
So baby don't come around anymore
Or you'll be standing outside my front door
So listen as I say
Baby I'm tearing us apart
Cause you're only gonna break my heart

Someday, somehow I might say
These words aloud
And I'll make you see what you're doing to me isn't right
But not right now

[Chorus:]
It's time for me to say
I know you're only gonna break my heart
You're getting in the way
I should've see this coming right from the start
So baby don't come around anymore
Or you'll be standing outside my front door
So listen as I say
Baby I'm tearing us apart
Cause you're only gonna break my heart
You're only gonna break my heart
You're only gonna break my heart---
