[Victoria Duffield]
Headline
Rumors and lies
Something's always going round
Cold eyes judging our lives
Like they know what's going down

They want to read us like a frontpage story
Up in their business like they're paparazzi
They think we're just another tabloid crush
In the end they don't know about us

[Chorus]
If they wanna talk, let them talk
(hey)
If they wanna whisper, then so what [?]
(hey)
They don't know about us
They don't know about us
They don't know about uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-us

If they wanna hate, let them hate
(hey)
Cause I don't matter what they say,
(hey)
They don't know about us
They don't know about us
They don't know about uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-us

[Cody Simpson]
No sound,
Truth cutting out,
Like a game of telephone
New found talk of the town,
They don't wanna leave us alone

[Victoria Duffield]
They draw attention to he said, she say
Yeah you're the only one I hear in my head

[Cody Simpson]
So let them dig they're just a tabloid pressure

[Both]
In the end they don't know about us

[Chorus]
If they wanna talk, let them talk
(hey)
If they wanna whisper, then so what [?]
(hey)
They don't know about us
They don't know about us
They don't know about uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-us

If they wanna hate, let them hate
(hey)
Cause I don't matter what they say,
(hey)
They don't know about us
They don't know about us
They don't know about uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-us

They don't know about us
(hey)
They don't know about us
They don't, no
They don't know about us
(hey)
They don't know about us
No

[Victoria Duffield]
Let them say what they say
Baby they can talk all night and day

[Cody Simpson]
Let them waste their time,
Rumors ain't never gonna change my mind

[Victoria Duffield]
Cause when you hold me tight,
I know it's worth the fight

[Both]
They don't know the truth,
They don't it like we do

[Chorus]
If they wanna talk, let them talk
(hey)
If they wanna whisper, then so what [?]
(hey)
They don't know about us
They don't know about us
They don't know about uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-us

If they wanna hate, let them hate
(hey)
Cause I don't matter what they say,
(hey)
They don't know about us
They don't know about us
They don't know about uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-us

They don't know about us,
They don't know, they don't know
They don't know about us,
They don't know, they don't know
They don't know about us,
They don't know, they don't know
