Here we are, right back at the start
You put your hand on my heart
And you ask me to take you back once again
I don't care cause my heart's on the dance floor
And I don't wanna hear you talk anymore, don't talk anymore

If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Baby don't say you're sorry
If you wanna take me, take me away tonight
I don't wanna hear you say to me
You were wrong to cut and run
Can't this wait until the morning comes
If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Shut up and dance, get up and dance
If you want me
If you want me
Shut up and dance, get up and dance

Now I'm lost in the music again
I don't want it to end
Just let it take you away, yea take me away
Baby don't talk while your heart's on the dance floor
I don't wanna hear you talk anymore, don't talk anymore

If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Baby don't say you're sorry
If you wanna take me, take me away tonight
I don't wanna hear you say to me
You were wrong to cut and run
Can't this wait until the morning comes
If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Shut up and dance, get up and dance
If you want me

There's so much to say, I know yesterday
And that you torn me apart!
But baby I know, you're sorry I know
That you would never mean to break my heart

If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Baby don't say you're sorry
If you wanna take me, take me away tonight
I don't wanna hear you say to me
You were wrong to cut and run
Can't this wait until the morning comes
If you wanna get up and dance with me tonight
Shut up and dance, get up and dance
If you want me

If you want me
Shut up and dance, get up and dance
If you want me
Shut up and dance, get up and dance---
