I bow my knee before Your throne
I know my life is not my own
I offer up this song of praise
To bring You pleasure Lord

I seek the Giver not the gift
My heart's desire is to lift Him
High above all earthly kings
To bring You pleasure, Lord

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Glory to the King ---Lyrics submitted by Mystique Petittat.
