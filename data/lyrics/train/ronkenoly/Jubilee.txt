This is the season of Jubille (echo)
Singing and dancing for you and me (echo)
Thanking and praising because we're free (echo)
Oh this is the year of Jubilee (echo)

Put your hands together
Everybody praise the Lord
Put your hands together
Sing and shout and praise the Lord

Everything that was stolen shall be returned unto me
Mother father sister brother they will all go free
Everything that was stolen shall be returned unto me
Singing dancing praising shouting increase and victory---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
