Holy holy holy holy
Holy is the Lord
Holy holy holy holy
Holy is the Lord of lords

I see the Lord seated on the throne exalted
And the train of His robe fills the temple with glory
And the whole earth is filled
And the whole earth is filled
And the whole earth is filled with His glory

(Repeat Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Emanuel.
