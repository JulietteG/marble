We are soldiers from a different world
Both her and I
We fight the shadow doppelgnger
Of the shady passer-by
The lads go out drinking
The girls keep an eye
But no ones on duty
This side of the sky

The same dark enemy will come and go
With the changing of the tide
Through the mist between the to and from
In the minds on either side
The lads go out drinking
While the girls try to keep an eye
But no ones on duty
This side of the sky

The enemys been landed
A hundred aeons now
Hes married to the queen of the machine
Who wouldnt hesitate
To sell the details of your soul
To the brutal inquisition magazine

The lads go out drinking
While the girls keep an eye
But no ones on duty
This side of the sky

He feels my collar on the slightest little whim
She tries to shield me from the harm
But its inevitably down to me or him

In the eye of such a storm
The lads go out drinking
While the girls keep an eye
But no ones on duty
This side of the sky

We dont live in our own village any more
Metropolis in home
Where the cut-purse and his wolves are at the door
And wildest politicians roam
The lads go out drinking
While the girls try to keep an eye
But no ones on duty
This side of the sky

The enemys been landed
A hundred aeons now
Hes married to the queen of the machine
Who wouldnt hesitate
To sell the details of your soul
To the brutal inquisition magazine

We are soldiers from a different world
Both her and I
We fight the shadow doppelgnger
Of the shady passer-by
The lads go out drinking
The girls try to keep an eye
But no ones on duty
This side of the sky
Yeah no ones on duty
This side of the sky
no ones on duty
This side of the sky---Lyrics submitted by Maria S.
