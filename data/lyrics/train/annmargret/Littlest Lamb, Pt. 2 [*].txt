You are still awake and its just past your bedtime
The Sandman had a date he couldn't keep
But when the lamb's commence to jump across the fence
I'll count them all before you fall asleep
The first little lamb jumped over the fence
And was off to the land of nod
The second and third were close behind
Like three little peas in a pod
The fourth little lamb was too chubby to jump
He crawled under instead
The fifth little lamb wasn't there at all
He must've stayed home in bed
Number six jumped around as confused as could be
He didn't know where he had been
He jumped over its true, but before he was through
He jumped over, jumped back
Then jumped over again
The next little lamb was the littlest lamb
Too little for such a big leap
Though he tried like a scout
He soon tuckered out 
Now the littlest lamb was asleep
The littlest lamb is asleep---Lyrics submitted by Yvette Gordon.
