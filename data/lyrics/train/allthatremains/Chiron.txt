Have not the strongest
and closest ties been bound so long
I've called upon them
they remind me where I'm from
With deep conviction
I am connected cross the miles
with out them nothing worth relying on

It's been so long since I could say
I've needed anything stronger
We can't be wrong when we have ties that bind us
if I rely and I know the strength
in those who taught me of the
power in the ties that bind

when I turn inward
and look for strength within my self
and demonstrations of courage
are the result
if inspiration is wholly shared
then more is the gain
then I will follow
the selfless actions displayed

It's been so long since I could say
I've needed anything stronger
We can't be wrong when we have ties that bind us
if I rely and I know the strength
in those who taught me of the
power in the ties that bind

we are made powerful(we are made powerful)

It's been so long since I could say
I've needed anything stronger
We can't be wrong when we have ties that bind us
if I rely and I know the strength
in those who taught me of the
power in the ties that bind

we are made powerful(we are made powerful)
we are made powerful(we are made powerful)---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
