I've watched the days pass
one by one until the fall of man
and seen the cynics feed the jaded
merely scraps and bones
the kingdom shaken
it's foundation nearly turned to sand
with foolish faith in faulted leaders
that I must disown

now rise again for this darkened heart
betrays what I've always held so dear
now rise again this darkened heart
it bleeds fast for all my family
now rise again this darkened heart
it bleeds fast for all humanity
now rise again this darkened heart
condemns my soul

I've laid to rest the false belief
of average stock in me
I'll not relent no average destiny
I'll reach the pont where mankind's sins
no longer rest in me
A long hard road this manifest destiny
now rise again for this darkened heart
betrays what I've always held so dear
now rise again this darkened heart
it bleeds fast for all my family
now rise again this darkened heart
it bleeds fast for all humanity
now rise again this darkened heart
condemns my soul

I will not be held down again (x5)---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
