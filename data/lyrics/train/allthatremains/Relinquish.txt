Still push harder and still
The facts remain
Just one to an open end
So quickly no quarter
A simple step now
A small matter of time
Lest not regret now
I'll make you push the line

Follow the lead to failure
Relinquish and pay no mind
Follow the lead to failure
Relinquish and pay no mind

Misplace my judgement
Misstep, the card house falls 
That will not be my legacy

This whole creation we've built
Through effort and time
We make this happen
We hold together with pride

Follow the lead to failure
Relinquish and pay no mind
Follow the lead to failure
Relinquish and pay no mind

This whole creation we've built
Through effort and time
We make this happen
We hold together with pride

Follow the lead to failure
Relinquish and pay no mind
Follow the lead to failure
Relinquish and pay no mind---Lyrics submitted by Steven.
