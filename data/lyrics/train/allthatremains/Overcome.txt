Past it haunts again 
the trace of life and fuck this nightmare 
that has no end the shadow of tomorrow 
so this day to day has my corpse shake into my raise 
my spirits high 
i never thought that 

i should never have thought that this would never end 
the moment we started old words you could not mend 

five and day to day 
six six the voice i take away 
my dreams are fallen 
no more to share 
now the end remains 
my one regret my body stays 
I'm sick again 
I fall from grace 

i should never have thought that this would never end 
the moment we started old words you could not mend 
should never have thought that this would never end 
the fear was to much for us to bare 

so this day to day has my corpse shake into my raise 
my spirits high i never thought that 

i should never have thought that this would never end 
the moment we started old words you could not mend 
should never have thought that this would never end 
the feel was to much for us to bare---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
