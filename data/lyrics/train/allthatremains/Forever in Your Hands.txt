I know that I can stand my head high
Forget Not where I Fall
Still I Find why and Reason

Yet that conflict still filling me 
Mistrust Venom inside me 
I am not the Man that you See
Just Look Inside Me

Trust in Me the way I trusted you
I know we could have done this together
If you believed in me like i believed in you
my heart would be forever in your hands 

How i miss February Still
Now that this becomes the moment
Of all our Failures

Yet that conflict still filling me 
Mistrust Venom inside me 
I am not the Man that you See
Just Look Inside Me

Trust in Me the way I trusted you
I know we could have done this together
If you believed in me like i believed in you
my heart would be forever in your hands 

Trust in Me the way I trusted you
I know we could have done this together
If you believed in me like i believed in you
my heart would be forever in your hands 

Forever in your hands---Lyrics submitted by candice.
