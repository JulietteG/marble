Well I fell down, down, down
Into this dark and lonely hole
There was no one there to care about me anymore
And I needed a way to climb and grab a hold of the edge
You were sitting there holding a rope

And well go up, up, up
But Ill fly a little higher
Well go up in the clouds because the view is a little nicer
Up here my dear
It wont be long now, it wont be long now

When I get back on land
Well Ill never get my chance
Be ready to live and itll be ripped right out of my hands
Maybe someday well take a little ride
Well go up, up, up and everything will be just fine

And well go up, up, up
But Ill fly a little higher
Well go up in the clouds because the view is a little nicer
Up here my dear

It wont be long now, it wont be long now
If only I had a little bit more time
If only I had a little bit more time with you

We could go up, up, up
And take that little ride
And sit there holding hands
And everything would be just right
And maybe someday Ill see you again
Well float up in the clouds and well never see the end

And well go up, up, up
But Ill fly a little higher
Well go up in the clouds because the view is a little nicer
Up here my dear
It wont be long now, it wont be long now---
