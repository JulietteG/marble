My blueberry eyes
Full of love 
For life

Can't set his feet
Through starry skies

Dreams are sweet
When they turn real

Dreams are sweet
When they turn real

Oh, beautiful son
Smiling light
Good morning son

Sleep so deep
You wake up with a smile

Chase floating fish
Through space and time
Love in your eyes
Belly laugh
Fill up my heart

Oh, beautiful son
Smiling light
Good morning son
