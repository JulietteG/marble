There aint no bar on the edge of town
Aint no guitar with a lonely sound
There aint no band playing that song
About some girl thats been gone too long

There aint no trucks in Texas
Aint no football in the south
Aint no bourbon in Kentucky, I aint drinkin me some now
Aint no stars in California, Memphis never had the blues
Oh, there aint no trucks in Texas, and I aint missing you

There aint no phone sitting by my drink
I dont hope its you every time it rings
I dont care where you are
I dont wish youd turn around that car
I dont call your friends, I dont want to know
I dont regret letting you go

And there aint no trucks in Texas
Aint no football in the south
Aint no bourbon in Kentucky, and I aint drinkin me some now
Aint no stars in California, Memphis never had the blues
Oh, there aint no trucks in Texas, and I aint missing you

They dont get high in Colorado or party down in New Orleans
Aint no losers out in Vegas
Aint no Jack in Tennessee
I aint had me one too many, and if you believe thats true
Oh, there aint no trucks in Texas, and I aint missing you

I aint missing you
I aint missing you---
