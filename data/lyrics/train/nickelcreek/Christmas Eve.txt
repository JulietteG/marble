It was Christmas Eve
And your message to me read,
"I really need to talk to you today."
We sat in your car that night,
Cried and said it all,
Then parted knowing nothing.

You headed north
And I made my way back south.
Stumbling through the door, I hit the ground.
And there I laid,
With 10,000 words to say
That all amount to one thing.

Please, darling, wait.
It's not all over yet.
Please, darling, wait.
It's not all over yet.
Please, darling, wait.
It's not all over yet.

Now it's New Year's Eve,
So I fake like I'm all right.
To say I'm moving on would be a lie.
'Cause I still believe,
Though you're wounded and so am I,
That we still have something.

Please, darling, wait.
It's not all over yet.
Please, darling, wait.
It's not all over yet.
Please, darling, wait.
It's not all over yet.
Over yet.
Over yet.
Over yet.

Please, darling, wait.
It's not all over yet.
Please, darling, wait.
It's not all over yet.
Please, darling, wait.
It's not all over yet.
(It's not over yet.)
(Please, darling, wait.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(Please, darling, wait.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(Please, darling, wait.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(Please, darling, wait.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(Please, darling, wait.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(Please, darling, wait.)
(Please, darling, wait.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(It's not all over yet.)
(Please, darling, wait.) ---
