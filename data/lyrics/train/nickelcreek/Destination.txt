You don't owe me
one more minute of your wasted time
you act like it's all fine

but all the years I gave you
thinking you knew that you wanted me
I wanted to believe

I've gotta make a destination
find where I'll be loved
This time I've got no hesitation
and I'll be movin' on
(to where I belong)
and I'll be movin' on

I'm tired of trying
to describe what you will never see
how that we could be

gave up and lost her
now you're looking for a little grace
well look at my face

I've gotta make a destination
find where I'll be loved
This time I've got no hesitation
and I'll be movin' on
(to where I belong)
and I'll be movin' on

empty corner gotta keep movin'
taking hits while you've been missing
night after night after I hear you

say we're solid
but I know we're looking through the cracks
in our little patch

it isn't hard to leave
knowing that I'll be getting life on track
never looking back

I've gotta make a destination
find where I'll be loved
This time I've got no hesitation
and I'll be movin' on
(to where I belong)
and I'll be movin' on
(find where I'll be loved)
I'm already gone ---
