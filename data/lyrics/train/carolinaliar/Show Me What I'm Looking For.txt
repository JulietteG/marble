Wait, Im wrong 
Should have done better than this 
Please, Ill be strong
Im finding it hard to resist
So show me what Im looking for

CHORUS
Save me, Im lost 
Oh lord, Ive been waiting for you 
Ill pay any cost 
Save me from being confused 
Show me what Im looking for 
Show me what Im looking foroh lord

Dont let go 
Ive wanted this far too long
Mistakes become regrets
Ive learned to love abuse
Please show me what Im looking for

CHORUS
Save me, Im lost 
Oh lord, Ive been waiting for you 
Ill pay any cost 
Save me from being confused 
Show me what Im looking for 
Show me what Im looking foroh lord

Show me what Im looking for
Show me what Im looking for
Show me what Im looking for

CHORUS
Save me, Im lost 
Oh lord, Ive been waiting for you 
Ill pay any cost 
Just save me from being confused 
Wait, Im wrong
I cant do better than this
Ill pay any cost 
Save me from being confused
Show me what Im looking for
Show me what Im looking for
Show me what Im looking for
Show me what Im looking foroh lord---Lyrics submitted by Kelly.
