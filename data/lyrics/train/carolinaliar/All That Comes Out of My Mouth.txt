Always thought I had a backbone
Never really needed anyone

From the cradle to the grave
Thought I knew how to behave
Thought I lived and learned

Shoot

But you've got me talking backwards
Some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard

Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, 
breathe in... shoot! 

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

'Cause you take my cool and you bottle it up
Make my tongue go numb and now

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

There was nothing that could break me
Always sleeping with the enemy

But when I'm with you on the edge
Something happens to my head and I just can't jump... jump! 

Two thousand people in your army
I'm pretty sure they wanna kill me
You know you're messin' with my brain
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in... shoot! 

Chorus:

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

'Cause you take my cool and you bottle it up
Make my tongue go numb and now

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

Always thought I had some backbone
Never really needed anyone

Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out... 

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey

'Cause you take my cool and you bottle it up
Make my tongue go numb and now

All that comes out of my mouth
Is he shoulda maw ea hey - ea hey---Lyrics submitted by Sophia Dentler.
