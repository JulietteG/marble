Don't you know
We can start again?
Endings are old,
But they help you see.
Can't quite believe
All of this and what it means.
You've become so bitter.

(chorus) 

You think you're better alone
For the sake your sanity.
It won't hurt a soul
If you just learn to breathe again.
You never had the nerve to begin with;
You think you're better alone.

Been here before:
Seeking safety in something to blame. 
You feel so hollow;
You could swear that you've grown.
Were anything
as big as your dream...
You've become so bitter.

(chorus) 

You think you're better alone
For the sake your sanity.
It won't hurt a soul
If you just learn to breathe again.
You never had the nerve to begin with;
You think you're better alone.

Aaaahh

Aaaahh

Aaaahh

Aaaahh

Never had the nerve to begin with.
Got to come to your senses.

(chorus) 

You think you're better alone
For the sake your sanity.
It won't hurt a soul
If you just learn to breathe again.
You never had the nerve to begin with;
You think you're better alone.---Lyrics submitted by G.
