If I had the chance to say 
Remove the walls, 
Let's clean the slate,
Would it make us new?
Should we find a way to start
Without the mess
We've made this far,
Would it make us new?
I've seen this movie 
Once before
Don't need to see the end, no

I can't get away and 
You will never leave me
Addicted to the game
It's time to make it easy
I can't get enough,
So I have to do the right thing
And give you back
'cause I'm done stealin'

If someone looked into our case
And said our files could be erased,
Would that make us new?
Just tell me when and where to sign,
I'll check in and do the time
And tell the truth
'Cause I've seen this movie twice before
Don't need to see the end, no

I can't get away and 
You will never leave me
Addicted to the game
It's time to make it easy
I can't get enough,
So I have to do the right thing
And give you back
'cause I'm done stealin'

I know that we can make our dreams
Come true
It's a crime committed,
We misunderstood oh yeah,
oh yeah...
'Cause I'm done stealin'

If a jury read your mind
You'd go away for quite some time,
Would that make us new?

I can't get away and 
You will never leave me
Addicted to the game
It's time to make it easy
I can't get enough,
So I have to do the right thing
And give you back
'cause I'm done stealin'

I can't get away and 
You will never leave me
Addicted to the game
It's time to make it easy
I can't get enough,
So I have to do the right thing
And give you back
'cause I'm done stealin'

Truely that is something I believe---Lyrics submitted by Shirley.
