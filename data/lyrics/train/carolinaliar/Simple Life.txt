An everlasting cigarette
That's all you are waiting for
A bus to take you back home
'Cause tuesday came too soon 
Wednesday left you feeling used
Oh tomorrow, you hope at least it's warm

Don't you want to live a simple life?
You pray for change before you turn out the lights
Burn a bridge every time it feels right
You don't want to forget where you're from

So tired of feeling cheap 
You're always in need in a cent
At least that's what you think
You've got two beasts to kill
So empty your gun
Oh good intentions, they weren't quite enough

Dont' you want to live a simple life?
You pray for change before you turn out the lights
Burn a bridge every time it feels right
Don't you want to forget where you're from
Don't you want to forget where you're from

You just want to live a simple life
Pray for change before you turn out the lights
Burn a bridge every time it feels right
You don't want to forget where you're from

You just want to live a simple life
You pray for change before you turn out the lights
Burn a bridge every time it feels right
Don't you want to forget where you're from?
Don't you want to forget where you're from?
Don't you want to forget where you're from?---Lyrics submitted by kara.
