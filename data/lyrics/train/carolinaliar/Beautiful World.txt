Here it comes in the morning
I'm just trying to forget
Keep it real, keep it simple
And somehow just get out of bed
And this city is endless,
I'm as cold as it's stone
Yeah, this city is endless and I'm,
I'm walking alone

Sunlight creeps in between the curtains
Lose the sheets there's no time for sleep
I lie, I'll pretend 'til I'm almost certain
It's a beautiful world

I wanna ask for direction
But I don't dare to disturb
I got a thing with affections yeah,
and that's why I am walking alone

Sunlight creeps in between the curtains
Lose the sheets there's no time for sleep
I lie, I'll pretend 'til I'm almost certain
It's a beautiful world

Here it comes in the morning

Sunlight creeps in between the curtains
Lose the sheets there's no time for sleep
I lie, I'll pretend 'til I'm almost certain
It's a beautiful world
(It's a beautiful world)

La la la la la
I lie, I'll pretend until I am almost certain
It's a beautiful world---Lyrics submitted by Shirley.
