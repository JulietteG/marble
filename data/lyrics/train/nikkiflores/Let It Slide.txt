I give you and inch and you take a mile 
We make mistakes then it breaks when you smile
I'm starting to feel like it ain't alright
How can you care if I don't cross your mind 
Cuz I . . 

Say what I want to talk but you just push me away
Tell me you're leaving when I want you to stay , oh oh oh
Never thought that loving you would hurt me this way 
But I'm the only one to blame 
Cuz I'm always sayin
It's okay , it's alright
I put the pain away and let it slide
I forgive and forget it
And then you promise me I won't regret it
But I do
It's not right
Because I turn around and let it slide
Am I crazy for thinking that someday you'll change things 
When you keep on crossin the line

Something about you won't let me go
Maybe it's fear of being alone
I keep saying I'm gonna move on
But it's so hard when you're out to know
But I . . 

Say what I want to talk but you just push me away
Tell me you're leaving when I want you to stay , oh oh oh
Never thought that loving you would hurt me this way 
But I'm the only one to blame 
Cuz I'm always sayin
It's okay , it's alright
I put the pain away and let it slide
I forgive and forget it
And then you promise me I won't regret it
But I do
It's not right
Because I turn around and let it slide
Am I crazy for thinking that someday you'll change things 
When you keep on crossin the line

Boy , I wish I didn't give in so easily
Oh , I don't know what to do
Cause I keep on feedin the fire 
When I should really be telling you we're through
Ohhhh

It's okay , it's alright
I put the pain away and let it slide
I forgive and forget it
And then you promise me I won't regret it
But I do
It's not right
Because I turn around and let it slide
Am I crazy for thinking that someday you'll change things 
When you keep on crossin the line---Lyrics submitted by Leah Townsend.
