One last cup of starlight
Before I wake and start my day
A past so filled with promise
Before I lost, I lost my way

Ah thats ok, and Im alright
I guess Ill be lost again
For one more night
Ooh and thats alright, Im ok
I'll wear the albatross
For one more day

[Solo]

As the past recalls the romance
Before the bets and what you make
I lost my friend in between them
And that was more than I could take

Ah thats ok, and Im alright
I guess Ill be lost again
For one more night
Ooh and thats alright, Im ok
I'll wear the albatross
For one more day

[Solo]

Ah thats ok, and Im alright
I guess Ill be lost again
For one more night
Ooh and thats alright, Im ok
I'll wear the albatross
For one more day
I'll wear the albatross
For one more day
I'll wear the albatross
For one more day

And because I know I'm alright ---Lyrics submitted by Mike Dash.
