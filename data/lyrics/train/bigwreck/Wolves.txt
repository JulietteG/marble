Mark my words
In between the lines
and every little piece of the story entwine

Ive always told my side my way

there was no more room
in the packet of wolves
they wouldnt let me in
So my mission was a foot
They showed us all we were without

I say bleed out your heart
If its still beating for someone else
Drop all those chains that keep you tethered
Keep you safe

Rosy little world
in your packet of wolves
A cozy little hang
in the back of your school

those stories always get so old

I was not my night
going off the grid
I never said you didnt
I never said you did

All of my favorite stories are about you

I say bleed out your heart
If its still beating for someone else
Break all those chains that keep you tethered
Keep you safe

I say bleed out your heart
If its still beating for someone else
Drop all those chains that keep you tethered
Keep you safe

I say bleed out your heart
If its still beating for someone else
Break all those chains that keep you tethered
Keep you safe---Lyrics submitted by Mike Dash.
