There is an answer asleep in my veins
Between the fire and the moment it rains
I can almost see what it means to be free

I'll learn the wave, when they wait, to the world outside
I was an animal trying to hide
It's instincts of being alive
But now it's perfectly yours

But now it's perfectly yours

No more a stranger to myself or a stranger to my fears
The clouds are erupting like missing years
The curtain is closed on a ballet of tears

I'll drift away 'tween the moonlight and the open road
'Tween the bullet and the time to reload
I can finally see what I've never seen
But now it's perfectly yours

Now it's perfectly yours
Perfectly yours
I don't wanna lose this feeling

When I'm out of my mind
When the sun tries to shine
When my heart skips a beat
When you're lost in the sheets
If I try not to scream
If I'm lost in a dream
If I'm not as I seem
I'm Perfectly yours

Perfectly yours
I don't wanna lose this feeling

When I'm out of my mind
When the sun tries to shine
When my heart skips a beat		All I want is to be less alone
When you're lost in the sheets
If I try not to scream				Come and find me
If I'm lost in a dream	
If I'm not as I seem
						        I'm perfectly yours
When I'm out of my mind
When the sun tries to shine
When my heart skips a beat
When you're lost in the sheets		Perfectly yours
If I try not to scream
If I'm lost in a dream
If I'm not as I seem
						        Perfectly yours---Lyrics submitted by Brian Lathrum.
