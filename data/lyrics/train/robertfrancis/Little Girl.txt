You said you want to be outside and you want to feel alive
I said I didn't want to move I just wanted to survive
So I sit here waiting for the sun to come
And I watched it rise like we'd never done

I want to kill myself just to kill all the pain
But then you'd know you'd feel like you're the one to blame
You were just too young and just too smart
Probably the best candidate for a broken heart

Rock and roll my little girl
Rock and roll in your big big world

Rock and roll my little girl
Rock and roll in your big big world

In a drunken state I call your name
From the bottom of my soul to the blood in my veins
Those days in the car when I couldn't pull through
You sang to me and all I wanted was you

I cant seem to do anything right anymore
How the days are so long and the nights are a blur
I want you to know that I'll always be the only one there
While you listen to his heartbeat 
While he runs his hands through your hair

Rock and roll my little girl
Rock and roll in your big big world

Rock and roll my little girl
Rock and roll in your big big world

Each day he works past the 9 to 5
Tell me tell me how does he know if you're even still alive
You made a portrait of myself and it made me cry
And through all the tears I lost I looked myself in the eye

What kind of man have I become that I have to let this go
Fate has made a fool of me I'll reap now what I sow
We were just two people alike indignity
Felt the ancient grudge to the mutiny of me

And I guess this is where we'll end our scene
Where my civil blood leaves my seething hands unclean

Rock and roll my little girl
Rock and roll in your big big world

Rock and roll my little girl
Rock and roll in your big big world

Rock and roll my little girl
Rock and roll in your big big world

Rock and roll my little girl
Rock and roll in your big big world

Rock and roll my little girl
Rock and roll in your big big...---Lyrics submitted by jeanelle.
