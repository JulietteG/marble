I'm in love with the girl that I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl that I can't live without
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time
To be in love, to be in love.

Let her be somebody else's queen, I don't wanna hear about it
There is too many others that know what I mean
And that's why I gotta live without it.

Chorus:
Cause, I'm in love with the girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love but I feel like I'm living it out
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love

All the stories coming back to me
About my friends and the people I don't wanna see
All the stories they just couldn't be true
Least not until I hear them from you

(Chorus)

(Chorus)

A bad time to be in love (such a bad time)
A bad time to be in love (such a bad time)
A bad time to be in love (such a bad time)
A bad time to be in love (such a bad time)
A bad time to be in love---Lyrics submitted by Devils.
