Well all my love I give it to you girl, my life I'll live it with you girl
Worth more to di I man than a diamond and a pearl
So just give it to me girl, and a live it with me girl... I wanna rock your world


I heard about it happenin'
I never thought it could be
the way he looked into my eyes
what he doin' to me
he caught me by surprise
he opened up my life
He wasn't like them other dudes
I wanna be his wife
he said he got played
I told him don't be scared
My mission make you mine
forget the rest
they ain't prepared
He said he liked my style
I said I liked his lips
he took my hand
and then he told me this


Well all my love I give it to you girl, my life I'll live it with you girl
Worth more to di I man than a diamond and a pearl
So just give it to me girl, and a live it with me girl... I wanna rock your world

You ever let a dude
you can't get out yo mind
you go to sleep
he in your dreams
he with you all the time
This was the way it was
thought it was meant to be
till I picked up the phone one night
and it was Tiffany
She said he was her dude
I said is that a fact
She said I let him go and play
but he always come back
I said that can't be true
she said it always is
I hung up, heart stuck
i cant believe this shit


Well all my love I give it to you girl, my life I'll live it with you girl
Worth more to di I man than a diamond and a pearl
So just give it to me girl, and a live it with me girl... I wanna rock your world...
