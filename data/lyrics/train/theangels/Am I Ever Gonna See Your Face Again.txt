Went down to Santa Fe
Where Renoir paints the walls
Described you clearly
But the sky began to fall

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Trams, cars and taxis
Like a wax-works on the move
Carry young girls past me
But none of them are you

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Without you near me
I got no place to go
Wait at the bar
Maybe you might show

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

I've got to stop these tears
That's falling from my eye
Go walk out in the rain
So no one sees me cry

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Can't stop the memory
That goes climbing through my brain
I get no answers
So the questions still remains

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Am I ever gonna see your face again
Am I ever gonna see your face again

Am I ever gonna see your face again---
