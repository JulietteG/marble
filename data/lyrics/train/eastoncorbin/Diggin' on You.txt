You, me, sitting at a red light
Slow rolling 'round the square
You can't help looking just right
Everybody can't help but stare
We can go 'round again
Or we can get outta here

I wanna write your name in the dust on the windshield
Ride you 'round town a time or two
Take you to the top of that big hill
Get a little lost in the light of the moon
Cause I'm buzzin' on, kissin' on, trippin' on
Diggin' on you

Street lights, showin' that suntan off like a neon sign
But that bench seat country girl slow dance
Girl you're making it hard to drive
I can't hardly wait for the rest of this night

I wanna write your name in the dust on the windshield
Ride you 'round town a time or two
Take you to the top of that big hill
Get a little lost in the light of the moon
Cause I'm buzzin' on, kissin' on, trippin' on
Diggin' on you

Got your smile on, got your cool on, got your ride on
Yeah everything I'm diggin' on

I wanna write your name in the dust on the windshield
Ride you 'round town a time or two
Take you to the top of that big hill
Get a little lost in the light of the moon
Buzzin' on, kissin' on, trippin' on
Diggin' on you

I'm diggin' on you
I'm diggin' on you
Buzzin' on, kissin' on, trippin' on
Diggin' on you---
