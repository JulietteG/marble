Girl I ain't quite sure now what just went down
It was all a flash
Whatever happened, happened way too fast
We hit rewind
Hold back the moonshine
Go back to that kiss, make sure that
There's nothing I missed
Nothing I missed

I ain't saying it wasn't good
It felt just like I hoped it would
I'm just saying that the stars up there
Ain't going nowhere
All I know is I can't decide if it was
Sweeter than honey or homemade wine
So girl if you don't mind
Can you kiss me one more time

Now we got all night
Girl it's alright, it's just us you know
It's okay to take it nice and slow
So close your pretty eyes
Hold on real tight
All I'm asking for is just one more
Like the one before
Just to be sure

I ain't saying it wasn't good
It felt just like I hoped it would
I'm just saying that the stars up there
Ain't going nowhere
All I know is I can't decide if it was
Sweeter than honey or homemade wine
So girl if you don't mind
Can you kiss me one more time
All I know is I can't decide if it was
Sweeter than honey or homemade wine
So girl if you don't mind
Can you kiss me one more time
Kiss me one more time---
