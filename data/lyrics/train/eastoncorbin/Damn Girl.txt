I want to dance by the water 'neath the Mexican sky
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me, are you with me?

I want to fall like the Carolina rain on your skin
I want to walk a little too far out on that limb
Take you every place I've been and never been
Are you with me, are you with me?

We can chase the wild dreams, live like crazy
Love me baby, come on, come on, come on
Just throw your arms around me
We can run like we won't run out of time

I want to fly so high that I'll never come down
I want to love so hard, it could rip my heart out
I want to get so lost that I'll never be found
Are you with me? Are you with me?

We can chase the wild dreams, live like crazy
Love me baby, come on, come on, come on
Just throw your arms around me
We can run like we won't run out of time

Are you with me?

We can chase the wild dreams, live like crazy
Love me baby, come on, come on, come on
Just throw your arms around me
We can run like we won't run out of time

Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?

Come on, come on, come on
Just come with me---
