Broken pieces of your life are on the floor
You realize that you never needed help before
Just take a risk and take my hand
Youre new to this, I understand
I promise if you let me in

[chorus]
We can fly away, leave this behind, yeah you and I
To a hideaway, away
Dont hide your pain, please open up, give me your trust
We can fly away, away

You cant find love in an empty room
Barricaded walls and doors wont hide your wounds
Love you should know, Im right outside
And if you open up you might
Let yourself go and touch the sky, and

[chorus]

But if you decide to come back down
Afraid of heights, say its over now
Then well hit the ground running
Cause youre my only one and
We can fix your broken wing, get you back in the clouds

[chorus]
