Victoria:
Driving down sunset on a Saturday night
It's getting kinda crazy under the lights
But we don't care, were passing the time
Watching those LA boyz roll by

Ariana:
In the drop tops, Harley, Escalades too
A hundred different flavors to vary your view
There's one for me and there's one for you
Watching them la boys roll through

Chorus:
Looking so hot down in Hollywood
You know they got got the goods so
Let's give it up for those LA Boys
Riding the waves up in Malibu
They really get get to you
So let's give it up for those LA boyz
Give it up give it up
You don't have no choice
Give it up give it up
For the LA boyz

Ariana:
West side east side everywhere between
Rockstars jam in the promenade for free
Flipping their skateboards on Venice Beach
LA boys come play with me
Turn it up turn it up
Come play with me

Chorus:
Looking so hot down in Hollywood
You know they got got the goods so
Lets give it up for those LA Boys
Riding the waves up in Malibu
They really get get to you
So let's give it up for those LA boyz

Put your number in my phone
Maybe I'll call you maybe not
What you doin' all alone
Come and show me what you got
Boy show me what you got
Got boy what you got boy
Show me what you got

Chorus:
Looking so hot down in Hollywood
You know they got got the goods so
Lets give it up for those LA Boys
Riding the waves up in Malibu
They really get get to you
So let's give it up for those LA boyz

Give it up for the LA Boyz
So lets give it up for the LA Boyz ---
