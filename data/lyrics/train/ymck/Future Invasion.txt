At long last, humanity has made a step to be remembered:
The miracle of 17,000 vacuum tubes
Let us row to the future
To the dream where cars can fly





The newest applications process by giga and tera
With high-speed logistics we can improve the efficiency of business
Seek after speed
For the sake of the pie (chart) over there





The idea of accelerating the world with ever-more-complex calculations,
what do you see beyond that?
No time to think about it.





Increase the speed
Increase the strength
Increase the distance
Increase the numbers





Beyond the seas
Beyond the sky
Beyond people
Beyond gods






At long last, an ability to calculate on par with the Big Bang
There is nothing left in this world that can't calculate
But nobody stops
In order to keep living, forever
But when will it be the future we dreamed of?

(



Increase the speed
Increase the strength
Increase the distance
Increase the numbers





Beyond the seas
Beyond the sky
Beyond people
Beyond gods) ---
