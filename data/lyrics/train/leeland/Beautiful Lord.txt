When the storm is raging all around me
You are the peace that calms my trouble scene
When the cares of this world darken my day
You are the light that shines and shows me the way

Oh the beauty of Your majesty 
On the cross You show Your love for me

Beautiful Lord,
Awesome and Mighty
I'm captured in this love I see
Beautiful Lord,
Tender and Holy
Your mercy brings me to my knees
It's Your mercy that has made me free
Beautiful Lord

When sin is all that I can see
Your grace remains the shelter that I seek
When the weakness is all I give
Your gentle spirit gives me strength again

Oh the beauty of Your majesty 
On the cross You show Your love for me

Beautiful Lord,
Awesome and Mighty
I'm captured in this love I see
Beautiful Lord,
Tender and Holy
Your mercy brings me to my knees

And I am lifted by Your love to sing
Its Your mercy that has made me free
And I am lifted by Your love to sing
Its Your mercy that has made me free

Oh the beauty of Your majesty 
On the cross You show Your love for me

Beautiful Lord,
Awesome and Mighty
I'm captured in this love I see
Beautiful Lord,
Tender and Holy
Your mercy brings me to my knees
It's Your mercy that has made me free
Beautiful Lord

Oh and Your beautiful, my Lord
Your beautiful, my Lord
Your beautiful, my Lord
Your beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Marisa.
