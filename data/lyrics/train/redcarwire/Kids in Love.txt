you got me wishing and im wishing on a thousand stars baby
and im running my mouth
cuz ur so damn pretty
should i drive home?
its 2 in the morning
either way you know it, you know ill be dreaming of
you with me and all the things you said to me like this
"we're cool" "lifes so good with you

Chorus
cuz its me and you
we're all alone baby
sneaking out our windows, we're on top of the city
so make it happen make your move
tomorrow is waiting....

every second that im with you 
i can feel my heart beating
every beat that it makes, its like a new life breathing
for the first time, love is a habit
if ur heart is a drug, im a down hill addict
its you that i would throw it all away for 1 more night, like this drive
i thought i was lost in the city
it was just ur eyes

Chorus
cuz its me and you
we're all alone baby
sneaking out our windows, we're on top of the city
so make it happen make your move
tomorrow is waiting....

sharing secrets share and tell
keep them keep me
say them softly ill never tell
ill never tell, ill never tell
all the words trust me girl
keep them keep me

Chorus
cuz its me and you
we're all alone baby
sneaking out our windows, we're on top of the city
so make it happen make your move
tomorrow is waiting....   (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
