I see it in your broken smile, 
and everytime you hide away. 
You always seem to press rewind, 
whenever there's a cloudy day. 

If you would only see what you've got, 
what you've got
You think that you are weak but you're not, 
you're not

Don't look back, no regrets, 
can't always run away, run away.
The future's not here yet,
 here come  your better days, your better days

You're not alone, you're not alone
Here come your better days
You're not alone, you're not alone
Here come your better days

Let your tears wash away,
all your troubles and pain.

You went and left it all behind,
all you found was loneliness.
Now you wish you could rewrite
all the pages of your past.

If you would only see what you've got, 
what you've got.
You think that you are weak,
but you're not, you're not

Don't look back, no regrets, 
can't always run away, run away
The future's not here yet, 
here come your better days, better days

You're not alone, you're not alone
Here come your better days
You're not alone, you're not alone
Here come your better days

Let your tears wash away,
all your troubles and pain.

You run, you run, you run 
But where are you running to?
You run, you run, you run 
Better days are waiting for you.

Don't look back, no regrets, 
can't always run away, run away
The future's not here yet, 
here come your better days, better days

You're not alone, you're not alone
Here come your better days, better days
You're not alone, you're not alone
Here come your better days

You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone, you're not alone---Lyrics submitted by Isabel Advis.
