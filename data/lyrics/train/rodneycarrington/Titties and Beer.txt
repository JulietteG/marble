Titties and beer
(titties and beer)
Titties and beer
(titties and beer)
I thank god almighty for titties and beer
(big titties and beer)
Huntin' two legged deer
(titties and beer)
Thank god I ain't queer
( titties and beer)
There's one thing daddy likes and thats titties and beer
(big ol' titties and beer) 
unison:
A little titties and beer
Great big titties and my beer
God damn it I love those motherfuckin' titties.....

That ain't the song but it is now. 
We would love to do that for your wedding if you would have us.---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
