That's what I think I need
But when you let me down gently
It still feels it hard, hard
Turn me into someone good
Thats what I really need
Tel me that Im someone good
So were not so far apart, apart
I hope it doesn't seem like Im young, foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it

Set me up Im slowly
Thats what you do to me
Oh you set me up slowly
Now I cant come down, down
Let me down gently
That's what I think you need
But when I let you down gently
And you try to hide your frowns, frowns
I hope it doesn't seem like Im young, foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it

And I hope it's sinking
Left behind your perfect skin
Theres a part of you thats free
And I know theres a place for me

Let me down gently
That's what I think I need
But when you let me down gently
It still feels it hard, hard
Turn me into someone good
Thats what I really need
Tel me that Im someone good
So were not so far apart, apart

I hope it doesn't seem like Im young and foolish and green
Let me in for a minute
You're not my life but I want you in it

And I hope it's sinking
Left behind your perfect skin
Theres a part of you thats free
And I know theres a place for me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
