Beyond the
Basic things
I wish you
I will just recall you to my love

From time to time
I will show this fact 
Preferably to you
Although everything has gone by

I was so sure 
That I would get you
But it was a fight against your heart

And today 
the day I've  met you
is the day 
since I can see 
there is someone 
who's better than me.---Lyrics submitted by Julie.
