I've been down and I'm on hold on for desire
let go and set it free, awake inside of me runs a fever
this time I've got to grow, this time I won't hide undercover
why can't we learn when somebody says?
do you love enough, to make me roll
I can't go on and on this way
do you love enough, to make me roll, the race is on let's roll away
right side is upside down
new thoughts spinning round for the real thing
true love hesitates, true love makes me wait I've been learning
with you I'm gonna ride, someday side by side and we'll run run run
why can't we learn when somebody says? do you love enough, to make me roll
I can't go on and on this way
do you love enough, to make me roll
the race is on let's roll away---Lyrics submitted by Joe Guerrero.
