We started out we were welcome in
We had enough when we needed it
Grip all you saw in a sea of shame
Run down your dream and then lose your place
Im falling back up and feeling good
You opportunity struck just like you thought it would

Dont want to know where the money is
Dont want to know where the money is
Its just a tragedy trying to take its toll again
Dont want to know where the money is

These days are easy they come to life
These colors brighten they all are mine
I want to move in a lovers march
My only grief is when we spend these days apart

Bury your ropes and let the wise mans daughter
Carry us down to where the walls dont speak
Bury my worries in the deep black water
Bury them down and take the weight off me---
