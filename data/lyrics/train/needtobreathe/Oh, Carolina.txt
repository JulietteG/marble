Oh Carolina
When I get back home to you were gonna start a fire
Oh you know I miss you
And when we get back home to you I got a story to give you

I been all mixed up been gathering dust
Down and down for days thinking bout us
I know we both cant deny it
There was a wrinkle in time way back when
We were living fast and I wont back in
Truth is baby I've been surviving
Cuz Im on my way

Oh Carolina
Yeah, when I get back home to you were gonna start a fire
Oh you know I miss you
And when we get back home to you I got a story to give you

I got it pushed to the floor and its almost light
Quarter past an hour and a matter of time
Bodys been gone for miles but heart still driving
Cuz Im on my way
Yeah Im on my way

Oh Carolina
Yeah, when I get back home to you were gonna start a fire
Oh you know I miss you
And when we get back home to you I got a story to give you

Oh Carolina
Yeah, when I get back home to you were gonna start a fire
Oh you know I miss you
And when we get back home to you I got a story to give you

Yeah when I get back home to you
When I get back home to you
When I get back home to you
We're gonna start a fire---
