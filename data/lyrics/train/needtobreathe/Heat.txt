The hurrys gonna bring you to your knees
I know this much is true
Your eyes are gonna rob you of your thunder
Show you everything but you
Were caught when are hands are off the wheel
And our foot is on the gas
Like a moth to a flame, the fire moves us
Were just waiting on the crash

You know we will

Let the drumbeats wash you over
Let the songs come and take you under
Push the life that brought you here away from you tonight
Theres a place where the pain cant touch ya
And theres a fire where the heat wont burn ya
Its in the sound of your voice tonight singing in one song

You can hear it in the trail behind your voice
Theres a multitude who claim
Theyve been through the fire of fallen angels
And theyll never be the same
We live with the weight of what weve done
The cracks that we slip through
No time to forget about our future
Just the things that we wont do

Cause I know youll hear

Let the drumbeats wash you over
Let the songs come and take you under
Push the life that brought you here away from you tonight
Theres a place where the pain cant touch ya
And theres a fire where the heat wont burn ya
Its in the sound of your voice tonight singing in one song

Cause I know youll hear
The power in the way
Your voice can sound 
When theres nothing left to say
I know youll feel
The way that I have felt tonight
Without a single thing in mind
It sounds just right
It sounds just right 
It sounds just right 
It sounds just right 

 Let the drumbeats wash you over
Let the songs come and take you under
Push the life that brought you here away from you tonight
Theres a place where the pain cant touch ya
And theres a fire where the heat wont burn ya
Its in the sound of your voice tonight singing in one song---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
