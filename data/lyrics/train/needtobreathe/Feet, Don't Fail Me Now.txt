I got this target
Right here on my back
Theyre aiming where I was
Not where Im at
Yeh they aint stopped me
Since I was eighteen
Im moving faster
Than my enemies

I cant slow down
I cant get stuck
Id rather die than have to hang it up

Dont wanna look up
And it be over
Dont want to wish that
I had longer
Its my time
Yeah its my town
I pray my feet wont ever slow me down
Dont fail me now

I saw my last dream
Roll out around me
Im trying to chase me
Down a fantasy
I felt the moonlight
Reach down and touch me
I need another night
Before you leave---
