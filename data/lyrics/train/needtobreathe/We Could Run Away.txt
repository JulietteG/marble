Everything stops as we look towards the clock
It feels like were moving backwards
Its easy to find potential in before
But we look the same in the afters

Could we wait long enough to bide my time
Could we stay and say enough to change my mind

We could run away
Maybe we could change
Get back on our feet and then
Maybe make it home again
We could run away
Be on our own again
Maybe in the twilight 
We can break out
Buy ourselves a Cadillac
Never turn around
We could run away
Be on our own again

We could stay here where things became unclear
Fighting whats left of the right way
But everyone hates the chances that we waste
Under the light of the new day

Could we wait long enough to bide my time
Could we stay and say enough to change my mind

We could run away
Maybe we could change
Get back on our feet and then
Maybe make it home again
We could run away
Be on our own again
Maybe in the twilight 
We can break out
Buy ourselves a Cadillac
Never turn around
We could run away
Be on our own again 

We could go away
Maybe we could change
Get back on our feet and then
Maybe make it home again
We could go away
Be on our own again
Maybe in the twilight 
We can break out
Buy ourselves a Cadillac
Never turn around
We could go away
Be on our own again 

We could run away
Maybe we could change
Get back on our feet and then
Maybe make it home again
We could run away
Be on our own again
Maybe in the twilight 
We can break out
Buy ourselves a Cadillac
Never turn around
We could run away
Be on our own again---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
