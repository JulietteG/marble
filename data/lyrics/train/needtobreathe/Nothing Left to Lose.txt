When my dreams are over
And my feet hit the floor
Is my will enough to move on
When we fight to get back
The love that weve lost
Will my hands be enough to push on
Tell me will I have enough to go on

Cause we are alive
We are strong
We cant watch it go for nothing
Watch until its gone
And we are down
But we can choose
Weve got nothing else to live for
Nothing left to lose

Love is just like a war we cant win
We can give, we can give, we can give
When we stand in the face of the world falling down
In your hands you hold the pen
Whats your answer for the end

Cause we are alive
We are strong
We cant watch it go for nothing
Watch until its gone
And we are down
But we can choose
Weve got nothing else to live for
Nothing left to lose

Oh, Oh, Ive got nothing left
Nothing left to lose
Oh, Oh, Ive got nothing left
Nothing left to lose

When theres nothing that we cant afford to sacrifice
Theres no way they can put out your fire
Theres no way they can put out my fire

Cause we are alive
We are strong
We cant watch it go for nothing
Watch until its gone
And we are down
But we can choose
Weve got nothing else to live for
Nothing left to lose

Oh, Oh, Ive got nothing left
Nothing left to lose
Oh, Oh, Ive got nothing left
Nothing left to lose---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
