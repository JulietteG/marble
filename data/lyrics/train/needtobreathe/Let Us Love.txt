We were born to embrace not accept it
We were given nothing more so we kept it
As the color of our boots keep fading
We live a life that we hate without saying

Who would listen to the cries of a poor man 
We never done nothing
How can we be something

Every heart has an hour of existence
Every breath brings a chance for redemption
If somehow we could Wake Up!

Let us love (like we were children)
Make us feel (like we're still living) 
in a world I know is burning to the ground

Give us time (to beat the system) 
Make us find (what we've been missing)
In a world I know is burning to the ground

In the crowd of the dead and disappointed
We're ashamed given up on what we wanted
Take a chance at long shot this time
Aren't we all just at least worth another try

I'm a king in the land of abuses
Undermined by the promise of excuses
Whose to win if we know that it's not fair
Who would fight when it seems that no one cares
If somehow we could Wake Up! 

Let us love (like we were children)
Make us feel (like we're still living) 
in a world I know is burning to the ground

Give us time (to beat the system) 
Make us find (what we've been missing)
In a world I know is burning to the ground

It's hard to stay here but where do we go?
I know we can't feel it anymore
It's true, time is wearing us down
We fall further and further away
Waiting for always to change

Let us love (like we were children)
Make us feel (like we were living) 
in a world I know is burning to the ground

Leave your hurting on the road behind you
Let the wind go with you till the morning comes

Yeah your sorrow, no it can't save you
It won't answer for what you've done---Lyrics submitted by Briana.
