Can we put back all the pieces to the puzzles left behind?
We will soon be back together just before the stars align.
When the curtain falls for one last time and closes out the show.
Marching left, right, left, another step. Keep smiling as you go.

Movin on
Movin on

Im sick of good intentions how they always tend to drown.
But, then, nothing seems to stay afloat living in the saddest town.
When the curtain falls for one last time and closes out the show.
Marching left, right, left, another step. Keep smiling as you go.

Movin on
Movin on
Movin on
Movin

Youre out of room for marking days on the wall
The lines remind of just how long Ive been gone
Youre holding on but now its time to let go.
Just let it go.

Movin on
Movin on
Movin on
Movin on

We could be the story thatll break your heart.
We could be the victim of a fall apart.
Maybe we could last another week or so.
Movin on baby means you gotta let it go.---Lyrics submitted by Leslie.
