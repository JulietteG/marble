Come down to the river 
Come and let yourself in 
Make good on a promise 
To never hurt again 
If you're lost and lonely 
You're Broken down 

Bring all of your troubles come lay 'em down 
All you sinners 
And the weak at heart 
All you helpless 
On the boulevards 
Wherever you are now 
Whatever evil you've found 

Bring all of your troubles 
And come lay 'em down 
We're all tied to the same old failings 
Finding shelter in things we know 
We're all dirty like corrupted small towns 

We'll bring our troubles 
We'll bring our troubles lay 'em down 
All you rich men 
And the high above 

All those with And without love 
All you burdened Broken down 
all  your troubles 
Come lay 'em down
Come lay 'em down
Come lay 'em down
Come lay 'em down

(background singers sing.....sing "come lay 'em down")

(Come lay 'em down)
FOR ALL YOU BROKEN...

(Come lay 'em down)
FOR ALL YOU HELPLESS....

(Come lay 'em down)
BRING ALL YOUR BURDENS...
.
(Come lay 'em down)
JUST LAY 'EM DOWN.....

(Come lay 'em down)
FOR ALL YOU BROKEN....

(Come lay 'em down)
FOR ALL YOU HELPLESS.....

(Come lay 'em down)
BRING ALL YOUR TROUBLES...
.
(Come lay 'em down)

......Just lay 'em down
Come lay 'em down
Come lay 'em down
Come lay 'em down......---Lyrics submitted by Darla Goodman.
