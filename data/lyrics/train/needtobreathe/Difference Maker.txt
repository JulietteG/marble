Yeah ain't it just amazing
How a god can tend a broken man
Yeah let him find a fortune
And then ruin it with his own two hands
Oh isn't it amazing
How a man can find himself alone
Calling through the darkness
For an answer that is never known
He walks on up the hill
The rock on which he stands
Looks back at the crowd
Looks down at his hands and he says
I am a difference maker

Oh I am a difference maker
Oh I am the only one who speaks to him
And I am the friendliest of friends of god

Yeah isn't it amazing
How a man can find himself alone
Calling through the darkness
For an answer that is never known
He walks on up the hill
The rock on which he stands
Looks back at the crowd
Looks down at his hands and he says
I am a difference maker

Oh I am a difference maker
Oh I am the only one that speaks to him
And I am the friendliest of friends of god

Yeah I am on the fence about
Nearly everything I've seen
And I have felt the fire
Put out with too much gasoline
And we're all strangers passing through
Places one afternoon
And life is but a vision
In a window that we're peeking thorough
A hopeless conversation
With a man who says he cares a lot
It's a hopeless confrontation
About who might throw a punch or not
But we are all transgressors
We're all sinners
We're all astronauts
So if you're beating death
Then raise your hand
And shut up if you're not

Oh I am a difference maker
Oh I am the only one that speaks to him
And I am the friendliest of friends of god

I am a difference maker
Oh I am the only one that speaks to him
And I am the friendliest of friends of god

I am a difference maker
Oh I am the only one that speaks to him
And I am the friendliest of friends of god ---
