My mind it ebbs and it flows, ebbs and goes
Though I find 
I can't memorize oh there was something I couldn't find 
And though I'm not very old 

My heart it ebbs and it flows
Ebbs and though I never know why 
I still wonder why
I can't remember why

I feel the rain-shine floating down on me
My body's naked, now I am free 
I was a young one before I knew you 
I leave a message get back to you

Leaving Atlanta I'm in sorry shape 
Mouth is bloody yeah it hangs agape 
I wish my touch could make you come 
turn to something new
It just won't stick it's bouncing through you

The eyes bend it because it won't stop 
it moves like the bowels of a hurricane 
Timing and pace
I want to know why I, I'm in a nutshell 
Oh God I'm locked up, I have no problems 
Everything spins faster, faster 
In the bath tub, locked up
Mad as a mother
Scared of everything locked in another 

We fuck around yeah we play the game
All the while in a pile we still act the same
When I ask you and your peers if you can feel it
Please, please, please don't say that if you don't mean it 

I live in Pearson with the graveyard bones
Singing songs and getting strong and 
watching new plants grow
Make it often make love everytime that you think you can
I am everything I understand
