( Got to be there, Go to be there) In the morning when she says hello to the world
( Got to be there, Got to be there) Bring her good times and show her that she's my girl

Oh what a feeling there'll be a moment I know that she loves me cause when I look in her eyes I realize I need her sharing my world besides me
So I've (Got to be there, Got to be there) In the morning and welcome her into the world welcome her into my world and show her is my girl  when she says, Hello world! ( Got to be there, Got be there) I need her sharing the world beside me
That's why I've (Got to be there, Got to be there) where love beings and that everywhere she goes I've got to be there so she knows that when she's with me she's home
( Oh she's home, oh she's home, Got to be there)
Got to be there to see her (Got to be there)
Got to be there to see her ( Got to be there)
Got to be there to see her ( Got to be there) 
Got to be there to see her ( Got to be there) 
Got to be there to see her ( Got to be there)
Got to be there to see her (Got to be there)...---Lyrics submitted by Gilles.
