Never felt so ugly, pretending that he loves me
Sometimes its just that money, never had to afford me
Now Im sick and tired of you, just taken right off
Knowing I forgive you

You aint here for dinner
Like Im a beginner, I loved you for your inner, inner, inner
And the next guy is out there somewhere,
But you wont dare, cause youre too scared

Chorus:
Have you ever needed someone so bad?
But he aint willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again.
If it makes you cry, cry, cry
And All you do is fight
Can't get no sleep at night?
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again.

Ever felt this sorry? All you did was worry
You didnt want nobody, thought it would get better
But its fallen more than
Oh its fallen more than ever
I just hoped that we would
Cause youre always up to no good
Maybe itll take someone else to show me better
But I dont wanna leave ya
Oh, ey

Chorus:
Have you ever needed someone so bad?
But he aint willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again.
If it makes you cry, cry, cry
And all you do is fight
Can't get no sleep at night?
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again.

Some of you know what it feels like
Caught up just in his life
Dont wanna try again, thinking whats the difference?
Why am I not interested?
Cause when youve been broken, you feel like no one can fix it
Yeah

Chorus:
Have you ever needed someone so bad?
But he aint willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again.
If it makes you cry, cry, cry
All you do is fight
Can't get no sleep at night?
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again.

Have you ever needed someone so bad?
(so bad yeah)
But he aint willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again.
(Sometimes you gotta lose to win again)
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Benti Dix.
