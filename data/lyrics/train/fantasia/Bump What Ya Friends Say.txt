This love is so much better , better  than I ever ever had Whooooa!

There not a better situation...... that i rather be in, some time we go through shit 
but your still my closet friend ,and although we may fight boy and i wanna go insanebut love that have for you still remains the same ,if i would listened to my best friend who said that you wasn't my type, then i would probably be just like them still searching looking for Mr. Right, if i would have listened to my family who said your not the right one for me then i would probably be down... in out... no doubt lonely yeah.... so you gotta 

You got a follow your heart babe (when it speaks)..... so bump what ya friends say yeah cause they might lead you the wrong way ............you no when your in love (repeat 2)

I'm glad I  stayed very patient...... instead of chasing around..... i could of ended up on a dead end but boy im on the right road now .....it's not a accident it was evident that maybe we were meant to be....... the last relationship i was in,  my friends said he was to good for me 
Yeah

(Chours)

Can't  miss this opprotunity, to find someone so sweet..... so i follow my gut baby cause your the only one for me.. you are ..you are ...you are.... you are......you are you are... you know when your in love,  so 
bump what your friend say, Cause they may lead youthe wrong way,  you know when your in love (fade out)---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
