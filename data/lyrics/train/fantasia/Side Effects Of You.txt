I was looking for a cure to pull me through
Try to decide which medicine to use
And every bottle has your name on the label
Doctor said you keep me stable
So now, Im taking three a day to help me smile
They said I should wait and try it for a while
So Ive been ignoring my symptoms
And the small print on the back of my prescription

What Im gonna do is
Fever over 98, you hold me and my body shakes
See nobody told me, nobody told me
The side effects of you
Losing balance, falling down
Sleepless nights whenever youre around
Nobody told me, nobody told me
The side effects of you
The side effects of you

I double checked the recommended dose
Cause recently my headaches getting worse
Sometimes every part of me is shaking
Is this the right pill that Im taking

What Im gonna do is
Fever over 98, you hold me and my body shakes
See nobody told me, nobody told me
The side effects of you
Losing balance, falling down
Sleepless nights whenever youre around
Nobody told me, nobody told me
The side effects of you

Youre supposed to take away the pain
But it hurts the same
And its getting harder
I thought you were taking care of me
But I cant breathe
And its getting harder

Fever over 98, you hold me and my body shakes
See nobody told me, nobody told me
The side effects of you
Losing balance, falling down
Sleepless nights whenever youre around
Nobody told me, nobody told me
The side effects of you
The side effects of you
Baby, the side effects of you ---Lyrics submitted by DJ Pittman.
