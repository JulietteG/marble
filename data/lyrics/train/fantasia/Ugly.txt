Couldn't have been but a hundred pounds
Soakin' wet
All stressed out and worried
Podunk, Missouri
And I don't know how or why or when
Her daddy left
But he drove off in a fury
She grew up in a hurry

Now skinny jeans and Maybelline
Make pretty girls do crazy things
Teenage tears and bathroom mirrors
Will stick with you throughout your years
Trust me, it's so so ugly

Picket fence, two car garage
The man that she don't love
But he makes six figures
She thought he'd fix her
But that iron gate feels more and more
Like an old bird cage than a way
To keep her out of danger
So she takes to liquor

Nor the champagne brunches and upper class shine
Can't keep a woman satisfied
Swimming pools and bows and braids
And the baby thinks her mom's a live-in maid
If you ask me, it's so so ugly

So give me a rusty old grain silo
Give me good food that sticks to my bones
Thank you for that good good man who loves me
With dirt on my hands and scrapes on my knees
The feeling at night when I wash it all clean
I'm telling you girls, it's a beautiful thing
Trust me, it's far from ugly

Eighteen wheels and an open road
I sing my songs all across the country
Cause these people trust me
So give me...

So give me a rusty old grain silo
Give me good food that sticks to my bones
Thank you for that good good man who loves me
With dirt on my hands and scrapes on my knees
The feeling at night when I wash it all clean
I'm telling you girls, it's a beautiful thing
Trust me, please trust me
It's far from ugly---
