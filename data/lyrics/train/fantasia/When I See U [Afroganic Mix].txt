Verse 1:] 
I put your picture on my note book, 
Start to blush when somebody say's your name 
In my Stomach theirs a pain 
See you walking in my direction I go the other way 
I start to studder when i Speak 
Try to stand but my knee's go weak 
What happening to me in the back can you tell me that this mean 
I lay my head on my pillow 
Show a star for a Sang 
Is this the Reason why 

[Chorus:] 
Your always on my mind 
When you come around I'm shy 
when i see you, when i see yuo 
Never no when youu might walk by 
so I gotta be right on time 
when i see you wheni see you 

[Verse 2:] 
I scibble X and O's in my notebook 
checking how my hair and nails look 
I feel my self in the zone 
I get nerves when you call 
so i say im not home 
I see your face when i here my Favorite song 
Should i Send a email at home 
Your the number 1 topic on the phone, 
I wonder if you know od do you have a clue 
I ley my head on my pillow you got me staring out the window 
Show a star for Sang 
What the reson Yeah... 

[Chorus] 

A Something Now is taking over me, 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Im not going run now just go to stand here yeah 
Ooooo 
Yeah
