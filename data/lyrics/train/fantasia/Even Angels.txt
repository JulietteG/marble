Im driving in circles shoulda bought that new phone
Cant find my way to all the places i call home
(Im on my own)
Im at the station pumping gas Yeah 
Im takin out the trash Yeah
(Im all alone)
And whose there, whose there

Since you've been gone i learnt how to move on
How to be myself I dont need no bodies help
Im doing so good 
I forgot that I could, Live like this Woah

First step take a deep breath
You dont need a reason why
You can, You can Take take Time
You can you can walk run dive
Close call think u might fall
All u gotta do is try
Even Angels even angels
Learn to fly

Coming home and its late night shoulda left the lights on
Cant help but imagine all the things that could go wrong
(Im on my own)
Im in the kitchen on a chair reaching for the top shelf
(Im all alone)
And Im ok, Im alright

Since you've been gone i learnt how to move on
How to be myself I dont need no bodies help
Im doing so good 
I forgot that I could, Live like this Woah

First step take a deep breath
You dont need a reason why
You can, You can Take take Time
You can you can walk run dive
Close call think u might fall
All u gotta do is try
Even Angels even angels
Learn to fly

Everyday Im stronger
Cant get better if it if it dont hurt
(Why oh Why oh Why)
See me in my next life
Cuz heart breaks a teacher
Now i love i love a little bit deeper
(oh why oh why oh why)

First step take a deep breath
You dont need a reason why
You can, You can Take take Time
You can you can walk run dive
Close call think u might fall
All u gotta do is try
Even Angels even angels
Learn how to fly 

Close call think u might fall
All u gotta do is try
Even Angels even angels
Learn to fly---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine.
