Same river from my window,
Same moon on the same trees.
I lie in the same bed where I held you,
Through winter nights that are just like these.

But nothing feels at all the same,
The old piano or the sound of rain,
Pick out a memory to keep me company,
To hold beside me while I sleep.

So goodnight my favourite dream,
Share your air,
Share your air, till dawn.
So goodnight my favourite dream,
Share your air,
Share your air, once more.

A terrible thought: my love can not hold you,
Here comes the silence, here comes the quiet.
A terrible ache to feel that I lost you,
How can my soul be satisfied?
Oh, how can my soul be satisfied?

So goodnight my favourite dream
Share your air,
Share your air, till dawn.
So goodnight my favourite dream
Share your air,
Share your air, once more.

I didn't mean to upset you.
I didn't know it was a test.
I was asleep before I met you,
And now you're gone and I can't get no rest.

So goodnight my favourite dream
Share your air,
Share your air, till dawn.
So goodnight my favourite dream
Share your air,
Share your air, once more.

(Repeat)

Share your air, share you air, once more.

So alive, so alive. ---
