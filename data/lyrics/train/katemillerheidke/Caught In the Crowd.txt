There was a guy at my school
when I was in highschool
we'd ride side by side 
in the mornings on our bicycles
we'd never even spoken or faced each other 
but on the last hill we'd race each other
when we reached the wrecks
we'd each go our own way
i wasnt in his classes
i didnt know his name
when we finally got to speak 
he strared at his feet
and mumbled a sentence that ended with James

[CHORUS]
I was young and caught in the crowd 
I didn't know then what I know now 
I was dumb, and I was proud 
And I'm sorry 
If I could go back do it again 
I'd be someone you could call friend 
Please please believe that I'm sorry 


Well he was quite a big guy, kinda shy and quiet 
When the kids called him weird he didn't try to deny it 
Every lunchtime he'd spend walking by himself 
Round the boundary of the grounds til he heard the bell 


Well one day I found him, joined him on his walk 
We were silent for a while until we started to talk 
I told him my family were fighting in court 
He said his step-dad and him always fought 


We talked about music, he was into punk 
Told me all the bands that I liked were junk 
I said I'd never heard the songs the sex pistols sang 
I laughed back at him and then the bell rang 

[CHORUS]

It was after school in the afternoon 
The corridors were crowded as we came out of the rooms 
Three guys I knew pushed him into the cement 
Threw away his bag and said he had no friends 

He yelled that he did and he looked around 
Tried getting up but they pushed him on down 
That's when he saw me, called out my name 
And I turned my back, and just walked away 
Yeah i turned my back, and just walked away 

I was young and caught in the crowd 
I didn't know then what i know now 
I was dumb, and i was proud 
And I'm sorry 
If I could go back, do it again 
I'd be someone you could call friend 
Please please, believe that I'm sorry. 
Please please, believe that I'm sorry.---Lyrics submitted by Jessie.
