Midnight in the Jungle
the monkeys are screaming
wondering what's keeping me sad and blue
oh, midnight on the ocean, __ is dreaming
where is my dream if i'm right here waiting for you, oh

Midnight in the Jungle
the monkeys are screaming
wondering what's keeping me sad and blue
oh, midnight on the ocean, __ is dreaming
where is my dream if i'm right here waiting for you, oh

Do you know what you did to me!

True love's waiting---Lyrics submitted by es.
