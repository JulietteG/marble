where am I going, what comes from you it was being true. were respective, were that wild 
soaking me into you. we'd stand the time amount, we're to never under man, your going down

but the burning of proof may take more than life time to see
Where am I going? what comes from you it was being true, were respective, were that wild, soaking
me into you (Chorus) (Music) (Chorus) la day DA, la day DA, la day DA, la day dahhhh,
