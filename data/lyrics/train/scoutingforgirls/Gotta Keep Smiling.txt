baba baba bada ba ba ba
baba baba bada ba ba ba
baba baba bada ba ba ba
baba baba bada ba ba ba

When a frown is the best you can do
When your down 
When your down in a bad place 
You with the sad face

When your stuck
When your falling apart 
In a rut
Yet your stuck with excuses
oh baby I'm useless!

(chorus)

Boys will be boys 
Girls will be girls
It's a mixed up 
Melted up 
Messed up world

Are you taking the mick?
cos aint life a b*tch sometimes?

You've gotta keep smiling
to the thunder and lightning
You've gotta keep trying
Don't cry before your hurt

You've gotta keep smiling
to the thunder and lightning
You've gotta keep fighting
Because things can't 
Things cant get much worse

Take a break 
Take a day to relax
Get away
Get away to the sunshine
Throw me a lifeline

When life is hard 
When life is just unfair
Well have a laugh 
Have a laugh at the rat race
We'll make a new place

Boys will be boys 
Girls will be girls
It's a mixed up 
Melted up 
Messed up world

Are you taking the mick?
cos aint life a b*tch sometimes?

You've gotta keep smiling
to the thunder and lightning
You've gotta keep trying
Don't cry before your hurt

You've gotta keep smiling
to the thunder and lightning
You've gotta keep fighting
Because things can't 
Things cant get much worse

Things cant get much worse (5x)---Lyrics submitted by Paige Lozowchuk.
