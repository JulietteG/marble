Heres a song you can sing along to
For when Ive gone away (for when Ive gone away)
Its a silly tune I wrote for you (for you)
You can sing it every day (you can sing it every day)

I dont want to leave you (I dont want to leave you)
I dont want to leave you tonight
I dont want to leave you (I dont want to leave you)
I dont want to leave you behind
I dont want to leave you tonight

So if youre down and Im not around
And the days seem far too long (the days seem far too long)
Well Ill be there if youre ever scared (ever scared)
You can hear me sing along (you can hear me sing along)

I dont want to leave you (I dont want to leave you)
I dont want to leave you tonight
I dont want to leave you (I dont want to leave you)
I dont want to leave you behind
I dont want to leave you tonight

And I know its hard but lifes a bit like that
When it pulls you down and stabs you in the back
And I know its hard, well get through this I know
I didnt know youve been gone for so long (for so long)
I didnt know youve been gone for so long (for so long)
I didnt know youve been gone for so long (for so long)
I didnt know youve been gone for so long (for so long)

I dont want to leave you
I dont want to leave you tonight
I dont want to leave you
I dont want to leave you tonight
I dont want to leave you (I dont want to leave you)
I dont want to leave you behind
I dont want to leave you (I dont want to leave you)
I dont want to leave you tonight
I dont want to leave you (I dont want to leave you)
I dont want to leave you behind
I dont want to leave you tonight
