Every night I remember that evening
The way you looked as you said you were leaving
The way you cried as you turn and walk away

The cruel words and the false accusations
The mean looks and the same old frustrations
I never thought that wed throw it all away
But we threw it all away

And Im a little bit lost without you, and Im a bloody big mess inside.
And Im a little bit lost without you. This aint a love song, this is goodbye.

This aint a love song, this is goodbye.


Ive been lost, Ive been out Ive been losing
Ive been tired. Im all hurt and confusion.
Ive been mad, Ive been the kind of man that Im not.

And though Im down, Ill be coming back fighting
I may be scared and a little bit frightened
But Ill be back, Ill be coming back to life.

Ill be coming back to life.

And Im a little bit lost without you, and Im a bloody big mess inside.
And Im a little bit lost without you. This aint a love song, this is goodbye.

This aint a love song, this is goodbye.


You can try, you can try but youll never keep me down.
You can try, you can try but youll never keep me down
I will be lost, I will be down.
I will be lost, I will be down
I will be lost, I will be down
I will be lost, I will be down.
I will be lost, I will be down.

And Im a little bit lost without you, and Im a bloody big mess inside.
And Im a little bit lost without you. But this aint a love song, this is goodbye
Its alright , its alright, cos you can try but youll never keep me down.
Its alright, its alright, I may be lost but youll never keep me down
You can try, you can try but youll never keep me down.
You can try, you can try I know Im lost but Im waiting to be found.

You can never keep me down
You can never keep me down.---Lyrics submitted by breanah.
