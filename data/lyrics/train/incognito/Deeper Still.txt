Deeper I fall, and deeper still, deeper I fall, and deeper still

The way that you love me, I really cant compare
And theres no metaphor or simile, no analogy can take me there
Theres no way I can say it, at least not with words
Youre an ocean that fills up every line of this verse

Im falling down, but it feels like flying
I hit the ground, but I wont be cryin
Can you imagine if we dived in underneath
Wont you come and bathe in this ocean with me

Deeper than the fathoms to the ocean floor and deeper still
The way you love me
Deeper than the feelin that I knew before, and deeper still
Come on, Im diggin it baby

The way that I see you, Its always fresh in my mind
Round every corner than I turn around youre the only face I find
Theres no way I would change this, its just what its supposed to be
Youre ocean that fills up every single inch of me

Im falling down, but it feels like flying
I hit the ground, but I wont be cryin
Can you imagine if we dived in underneath
Wont you come and bathe in this ocean with me---
