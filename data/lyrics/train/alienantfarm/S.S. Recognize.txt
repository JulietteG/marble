I'm back to your game
Impacting for rain
And to the flow when
I think the vessel bent

Now time is precious
Rocky waves we're nauseous
Knocking... Everything is wet!
From us the ocean will be fed

What made us try
To have done what we do
Let's dream of dry
Then I'll tremble in the night sky full-tide

Don't you recognize, I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad
Don't you recognize, I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad

Now it's been days
And the sun won't show it's face
To blame mistakes on me
Now the cold becomes obscene

Will you just spend
Think I'm saving my life again
This ship has made me cry
I think the next we should fly sky fuel side

Don't you recognize? I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad!
Don't you recognize? I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad!

Will bring up all the sharks
Cause all the whales have got my suit
You failed to recognize all the things we do
Check yourself, the boat's just bout to sink
Your gonna choke on the salt if you dry to drink

Will bring up all the sharks
Cause all the whales have got my suit
You failed to recognize all the things we do
Check yourself, the boat's just bout to sink
Cause we don't need you bitch
You think you are the missed link

All the prison in the world couldn't make you
All the rescue that I see don't bring you
Stand up or sit back and walk the plank
Hit the deck and recall [2X]

All the prison in the world couldn't make you [3X]

Jump, Jump, Jump

Sit back and walk the plank
Hit the deck and recall all you used to take
All the things that don't work
Hit the deck and recall
Don't you recognize? I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad!
Don't you recognize? I'll rock the boat again
I'm getting scurvy, bad!

Don't you? [4X]---Lyrics submitted by Nathan Higgins.
