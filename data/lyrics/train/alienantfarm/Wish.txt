Proud, proud is to hear it all yeah yeah
Proud ah proud, proud is to watch us fall yeah yeah

Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
Throw kisses all the time
Make wishes don't break mine
Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
Throw kisses all the time...
don't break mine(x4)

Chime use to break my wish, wish, wish

Cold fire use to inspire all not now
These are tired, maybe they'll find their niche
Or resort to wish

Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
Throw kisses all the time
Make wishes don't break mine
Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
Throw kisses all the time
Make wishes don't break...

Chime use to break my wish, wish, wish

Ehhhh, won't you bring him back? not now
Chime use to break my wish
Won't you bring him back? not now

Don't be low(x3), you better watch the road

Don't be low, you better watch the road
Don't be low, you got the strength and the balls(x2)

Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
Throw kisses all the time
Make wishes don't break mine
Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
Throw kisses all the time
don't break mine(x4)

Don't be low, you better watch the road
Don't be low, you got the strength and the balls

Don't be low, you better...
Don't be low, you got the...
Don't be low, you better watch the road---Lyrics submitted by jonathan.
