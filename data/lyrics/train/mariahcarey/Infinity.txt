Why you mad? Talkin' 'bout you're mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
Thats your bag, yup, thats too bad
Show is over, you aint gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy, you actin' so corny like Fritos
Wouldnt have none of that without me though
Aint none of my business, it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game, you're a free throw
It's nothing that you dont already know

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
Theres an end to infinity
To infinity

How I say this? Fact that you still exist
No disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is
Truthfully Im through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Aint no compliments (duh)
Aint no being friends (duh)
Aint no false pretense (duh)
Aint no make amends (duh)
Aint no come agains (duh)
Thats the story, aint no happy ends

Is it lack of ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt this on your own?
Why you tryin' to play like youre so grown?
Everything you own, boy, you still owe

You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream---
