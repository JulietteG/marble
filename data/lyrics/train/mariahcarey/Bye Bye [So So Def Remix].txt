this is for my people
who just lose somebody
ur best fren, ur baby, ur man
or ur lady

put ur hand way up high
we will never say bye

mama's,daddies,sister, brother
fren n cousins
this is for my people who lost their grandmothers
lift ur head to the sky,
we will never say bye

as a child there were them times
i didn't get it but u kept me in line
i didn't know why u didnt show up sometimes

it's something more than saying 'i miss u'
but when we talked too

all them grow folk things
separation brings
u never let me know it
u never let it show it
because u loved me and obviously
there's so much more left to say
if u were with me today

face to face

* chorus
i never knew i could hurt like this
and everyday life goes on like
"i wish i could talk to u for awhile"
"i wish i could find a way try not to cry"
as time goes by...

as soon as u reach a better place
still i'll give the whole world to see ur face
and i'm right here next to u
it feels like u gone too soon
the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

bye bye bye bye bye (3x)

and u never got the chance to
see how good i've done
and u never got to see me back at number one
i wish that u were here to celebrate together
i wish that we could spend the holiday together

i remember when u used to tuck me in at night
with the teddy bear u gave to me that i held so tight
i thought u were so strong
that u can make it through whatever

it's so hard to accept the
fact u're gone forever

*chorus

this is for my people
who just lose somebody
ur best fren, ur baby, ur man
or ur lady

put ur hand way up high
we will never say bye

mama's,daddies,sister, brother
fren n cousins
this is for my people who lost their grandmothers
lift ur head to the sky,
we will never say bye
