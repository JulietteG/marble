Oh welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel
Oh welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel

Though the lights were low
I could see you both
in a lovers silhoutte
and my heart stood still
I was frozen right there
staring down at her, red dress

So i bolted out the door
jumped right into the car
it's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are
rolled down all the windows just so I can breathe
can't believe you just actually did this shit to me

I'm going about a hundred
mascara running
laughing out of anger
but it don't strike me as funny
been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
to have something like this happen in my own bedroom

Betcha gon know how it feels
when i get you back
betcha gon know how it feels
& your heart`s been cracked
betcha gon know how it feels
we fade to black
and you see your whole world collapse

ima la la la la la laugh
right in your face boy

betcha gon know
betcha gon
betcha gon
betcha gon
betcha gon x2

so i pull to the side of the road to fix my face
but i cant cover with makeup what my tears want to raise
i wake up in a haze morning dew and sunrays as i drive i hide my eyes behind my black____ shades
a block from the house slowly creep in the driveway
tip toe through the door but your there wide awake
your like where you been
im like sorry but i fell asleep on jazmines sofa
i coulda swore that ray-ray called you and told ya
your like you ok im like im alright go to sleep ill be fine
But if only you knew what was in the back of my mind
what you already started what you`d really gon find out there in time

Betcha gon know how it feels
when i get you back
betcha gon know how it feels
& your heart`s been cracked
betcha gon know how it feels
when we fade to black
and you see your whole world collapse

this is for real for real for real
Oprah Winfrey whole segment for real for real
20/20 barbara walters for real for real
60 minutes for real

baby
I had all my trust in you and look at what you put me through
you got my all crazy
somewhere down the line you gon get what you deserve you ***%*$
You were supposed to save me
my Sweet baby

Now were fading away
But you gon know how this feels even if its the last thing I ever do---Lyrics submitted by JoOsTiiN.
