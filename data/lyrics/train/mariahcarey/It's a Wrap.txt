Verse 1
Yet another early mornin'
And you walk in
Like it's nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no doughnuts, ain't no coffee
See I know you seen me callin' and callin'
I should crack you right in your forehead

Hook
Let me take a breath (Let me take a breath)

and regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)

if you effed up it's over
"Cause hen it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You did wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong

Chorus
So just scododododo, scododododo baby
It's a wrap for you baby
(It's a wrap, it's a wrap)
It's a wrap for you boy, oh baby
ooo wee ooo, ooo wee ooo

Verse 2
If I ever misrepresented my self image
Then I'm sorry
I was oh-so acquiescent
But I learned my lesson
Boy you sorry
boo boo boo boo out in the open
Don't make me go call Maury Povich

Hook
Let me take a breath (Let me take a breath)

and regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)

if you effed up it's over
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You did wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong

Chorus
So just scododododo, scododododo baby
It's a wrap for you baby
(It's a wrap, it's a wrap)
It's a wrap for you boy, oh baby
ooo wee ooo, ooo wee ooo

Bridge
Put all your $$@+ in the elevator
It's going down like a denominator
Trying to keep holding on, holding on
Boy let me go
You gonna wake my neighbors
Get away from my door
That was your last chance
You ain't comin' back
It's the martini,

I mean it baby
It's a wrap

When it's it gone, it's gone


Adlibs
Boy I ain't playin' a game
I told u I told u
It's a wrap
If u effed up one more time it's over
So get out of my face,
Don't come over.
Been sitting here all night
Leave me alone
Since one after three
I've been drinking patron
Let the credits roll---Lyrics submitted by JoOsTiiN.
