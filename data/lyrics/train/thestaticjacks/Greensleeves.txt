GREEN SLEEVES

There was a time
When hearts were young, (and) so was I
Adore the past before it all came down
When odds were always on the rise
When we wouldn't have it any other way, but

We could always run
We could always hide, or we could fight it
There was a always room
Just some of it was true, we didn't mind it

And always open door
Always on the move, it was exciting
Now the walls are bare
Now we really care, and not we're trying
To remember life here

One-hand-lover, secret levels
I'll find out what it meant for me to be 
Even if you can see the way, You won't ever lead 
me...
There was a time

When bond were strong, but so I was
Before the crass, before the empty town
And I was always on the rise
But we couldn't have it any other way, so

We would strategize
We would sometimes lie, and we would try it
Gonna find a room
Gonna see you , hope you don't mind it
What happened here 

One-hand-lover, secret levels
I'll find out what it meant for me to be 
Even if you can see the way 
You won't ever lead me back again---Lyrics submitted by Astro Li.
