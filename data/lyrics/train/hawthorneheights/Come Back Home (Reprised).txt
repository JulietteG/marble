Come back home
You're all alone
Everyone is waiting for
The words to say
To make you stay
To keep you in their arms

Hold still so I can feel
The words that hurt, the hit that kills
The latest fights that lasts some nights
Turn off the lights and leave right now

I know, I know
I'm too slow to catch you here
I know, that she knows
She's running far, far from me

Come back home
Pick up the phone
Or just call my name out loud
So i can hear, so loud and clear
Our time is running, running out

I know, I know
I'm too slow to catch you here
I know, that she knows
She's running far, far from me

Slow down, oh no
So i can catch you now
Slow down, oh no
So we can work this out

I'm growing tired
Let's start a fire
And then we'll fall asleep
You and me.

I'm growing tired
Let's start a fire
And then we'll fall asleep
You and me

Forget what you're not, not what you've learned
I know where you are, I know you got burned
I know you got burned

I know, I know
I'm too slow to catch you here
I know, that she knows
She's running far, far from me

Slow down, oh no
So I can catch you now
Slow down, oh no
So we can work this out---Lyrics submitted by Xavier.
