And you will live on,
Our hearts will beat stronger
As we remain as one
We will last a little While longer 
And as we pull ourselves together, 
We can't help but be torn apart
And we will always have each other
Just like it was from the start 

When Five becomes four
and four becomes one
you're not just passing on
you're passing on all the fun we had
you made us laugh
we only cried but once
you made us laugh 
in photographs 
on display for everyone

And the time has come now
And we must figure out
Driving north or going south
growing up or falling down
and as we pull ourselves together
we can't help but be torn apart
and we will always have each other
just like it was from the start

when five becomes four
and four becomes one
you're not just passing on
you're passing on all the fun we had
you made us laugh
we only cried but once
you made us laugh in photographs
on display for everyone

When five becomes four
and four becomes one
you're not just passing on
You're passing on all the fun we had
you made us laugh
we only cried but once
you made us laugh
in photographs
on display for everyone

and the time has come now
and we must figure out
driving north or going south
growing up or falling down---Lyrics submitted by Kendra.
