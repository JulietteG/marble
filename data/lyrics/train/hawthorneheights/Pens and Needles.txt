I miss you most on winter mornings
As we drift we slip through evenings wo-ah
We drive into the cold and dark with fingers crossed
I follow your eyes to avoid from getting lost

And all i had was a memory of what was
So let's pretend it never mattered to us
I hope this message finds you well 
Never thought i'd live to tell

Just to survive
We do what we can 
We read the maps and signs
And we make the plans
By our design and write it down
To get me by
The worst time in my life

And all i had was a memory of what was
So let's pretend it never mattered to us
I hope this message finds you well
Never thought i'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real
The way i really feel

(Screamo...)
I hope this message finds you well
I never thought i'd live to tell
What is dream and what is REAL!!!

So lets pretend this is the ending
To the message i've been sending
Sending....

And all i had was a memory of what was
So let's pretend it never mattered to us
I hope this message finds you well
Never thought i'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real 
The way i really feel---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
