These colors will not change,
You change the way I see them
These words will fade
When you explain
Why you hate them
We are the same

She keeps repeating (echo She keeps repeating)
All that she needed
She said she's right here (echo She says she's right here),
She seems so distant

Saying goodbye, this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry

Just a few last hours, we gotta make this count (echo we gotta make this count)
We're counting backwards
(Just a few last hours, we gotta make this count)
We're falling forwards.

She keeps repeating (echo She keeps repeating)
All that she needed
She said she's right here (echo she says she's right here)
She seems so distant

Saying goodbye, this time, the same old story,
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry,
Saying goodbye, this time, the same old story,
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry.

Saying sorry, we're falling apart
Wish we knew this from the start
Saying goodbyes', the hardest part
Wish we knew this from the start

Saying goodbye, this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry
Saying goodbye, this time, the same old story
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry
Saying goodbye, this time, (echo this time),
Seeing you cry, makes me feel like saying sorry---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
