i know i know i know its over 
upon the platform inside the slaughter house 
just a slip away from murder 
oooooooooover 
in the night a mystery should unfold 
where i wish for waking up unaware 
but its not unclear at all 
underlined in red on your jacket sleeve 
were the curse blank as a toothache 
but its not unclear at all 

I know

i know i know i know its over 
your final descent ick ick ick ick ick 
mixing pills and gas with incest 
on the plane ooooover 
folded up the last year of your life 
every play you tried to write in school 
venice is the right place to kill yourself 
like a cricket blob in the cactus club 
pass away and chirping in my ear---Lyrics submitted by Lilly.
