It started on the real world
A hot tub full of hot girls
Grindin' every frat boy and freak

Line up all the idols
Who paint on phony smiles
Tryin' to ride the fast track for free

Who's the biggest loser?
I'll bust the biggest boozer
Bigger ratings for MTV

All the sole survivors
Still stranded on the island
Lying through their teeth for money

So everybody dance and everybody sing,
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Yeah we can swing it,
Cha-ching
When you take off all your clothes, when you strike a playboy pose
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Then you gotta bring it
Cha-ching

Everybody stop and stare
Kardashian's ass is everywhere
If you missed it watch TMZ

Pretending to be lesbians
The tila's playing all of them
While flavor flav get fucked up for free

Guess who's really livin' large
It's mini me the porn star
Google it i think you'll agree

And all the hotties on the hills
Just getting rich and making deals
While you and i are watchin' TV

So everybody dance and everybody sing,
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Yeah we can swing it
Cha-ching
When you take off all your clothes, When you strike a playboy pose
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Then you gotta bring it
Cha-ching

The all american dream
Is getting 15 for free

The all american dream is so skin deep

It started on the real world
A hot tub full of hot girls
Grinding every frat boy and freak

So everybody dance and everybody sing,
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Yeah we can swing it
Cha-ching
When you take off all your clothes, When you strike a play boy pose
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Then you gotta bring it
Cha-ching

So everybody dance and everybody sing,
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Yeah we can swing it
Cha-ching
When you take off all your clothes, When you strike a play boy pose
If you wanna go far, if you wanna be a star
Then you gotta bring it
Cha-ching

So hurry turn it on, turn it on, get your 15 minutes
15's almost gone, turn it on, turn it on
(cha-ching)
So hurry turn it on, turn it on, get your 15 minutes
15's almost gone, turn it on, turn it on
