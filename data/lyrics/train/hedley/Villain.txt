im so cold and far away from home
you're so tired and so damn alone
it's darker and much harder to be me
so far away from my reality

i hate the way you look, i'm looking back
i hate the way i look you're looking too
i think maybe i'm just
falling (3)

and you kiss me like you know inside of me
(let me lead you, let me follow)
and you watch me fight my own insanity
(let me lead you, let me follow)
and i feel like i'm a villain, Jesus said would never ever leave us
and i'm stronger now than i ever was before

you think i never could have seen it all
it seems you want me just to watch me fall
your fingers and your lips are beautiful
your fingers and your lips are killing me

i hate the way you look, i'm looking back
i hate the way i look you're looking too
i think maybe i'm just
falling (3)

and you kiss me like you know inside of me
(let me lead you, let me follow)
and you watch me fight my own insanity
(let me lead you, let me follow)
and i feel like i'm a villain, Jesus said would never ever leave us
and i'm stronger now than i ever was before
then i was before

{MUSIC BREAK}

im stronger than i've ever been
im stronger than before
but you kiss me like you know it all
you know it all (15)

and you kiss me like you know inside of me
(let me lead you, let me follow)
and you watch me fight my own insanity
(let me lead you, let me follow)
and i feel like i'm a villain, Jesus said would never ever leave us
and i feel like im a villain jesus said would never ever leave us 
and i'm stronger now than i ever was before
and im stronger now than i ever was before
and im stronger now then i ever was before
was before (3)---Lyrics submitted by toni.
