Been losing my mind
Its been a long steady race
Keep closing my eyes
I still see that face
Been bleeding a lot
Like youre bleeding alone
Your hands tied behind your back
There aint nobody home

Its a long way down (2x)

Been losing my way
And a sky so blue
Its the worst part of me
Its the baddest side of you
And the river is high
I never felt so low
I can stick around some more
I aint got no place to go

Its a long way down (4x)
(Take it, Dave)

When you burst through my door
And your eyes fix a stare
I hate seeing you so down, darling
It makes me so damn scared
You said I hate us this way
I dont wanna be alone
I opened up my arms and said
darling, come back home
Cuz it tears me apart
Just to see you this way
See Ive built my life around you girl
Maybe you should stay

Its a long way down (6x)
(Take it away, boys)
Yeah, whoa. Ooh
Its a long way down (4x)---Lyrics submitted by jessie d.
