Say a prayer
say a little common sense 
Stay right there
stay right there in our defense 
Give a little bit, give a little bit more 
Just a little bit, babe a little bit more 

You're amazing
you're amazing and its true 
No one can save me
no one can save me like you do 
This is crazy
yeah its crazy but its true 
Baby save
baby save me like you do 

Stay away 
stay close enough to care 
I love that name
yeah I see it everywhere 
So can we get along
can we get along much more 
Just a little bit
babe a little bit more 

You're amazing
you're amazing and its true 
No one can save me
no one can save me like you do 
This is crazy
yeah its crazy but its true 
Baby save me
baby save me like you do 

And when you found me I was barely breathing 
You take my heart and you make it even 
I'll be your strong side I've grown 
And every part of me will never go back 
Its what you started in me you better know I'm all yours

So believe me when I say 
You're amazing
you're amazing and its true
No one can save me
so baby save me like you do 
This is crazy
yeah its crazy but its true 
Baby save me
baby baby save 

You're amazing
you're amazing and its true 
No one can save me
no one can save me like you do 
This is crazy, 
yeah its crazy but its true 
Baby save me, 
baby save me like you do 
Baby save me like you do---Lyrics submitted by Canadian.
