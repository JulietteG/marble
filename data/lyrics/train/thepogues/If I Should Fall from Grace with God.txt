If I should fall from grace with God
Where no doctor can relieve me
If I'm buried 'neath the sod
But the angels won't receive me

Let me go boys, let me go boys
Let me go down in the mud
Where the rivers all run dry

This land was always ours 
Was the proud land of our fathers
It belongs to us and them
Not to any of the others

Bury me at sea
Where no murdered ghosts can haunt me
If I rock upon the waves
Then no corpse can lie upon me

It's comin up threes boys
Keep comin up threes boys
Let 'em go down in the mud
Where the rivers all run dry

If I should fall from grace with God
Where no doctor can relieve me
If I'm buried 'neath the sod
But the angels won't receive me---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
