Baby, when I think about you
I think about love
Darlin, dont live without you
And your love
If I had those golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the heaven
till Im dyin on the way

Feel like makin
Feel like makin love
Feel like makin'love
Feel like makin'love
Feel like makin love to you

Baby, if I think about you
I think about love
Darlin if I live without you
I live without love
If I had the sun and moon
and it was shining 
I would give you both night and day
Of satisfyn

Feel like makin
Feel like makinlove
Feel like makin'love
Feel like makin'love
Feel like makin love to you

And if I had those golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the heaven
til Im dyin on the way

Feel like makin love
Feel like makin love
(repeat many times)
Feel like makin love to you---Lyrics submitted by Annette.
