Should've told you by now
But I can't find the words
Oh no,
If I could show you somehow
But I don't have the nerve 
Oh yeah
You don't see me looking at you
How could love be so blind
Somehow you don't notice me
Sooner or later, yeah, there will come a time, baby,

If you needed somebody, ah the way that I need you, yeah
If you wanted somebody, ah the way that I want you, yeah
Oh yeah, the way that I want you

If I could hold you tonight
It would last me forever
Though the time's never right, 
Oh,When will we be together
Oh no,
If I could make you understand 
what you're doing to me
Maybe there would come a time
When sooner or later, yeah, I will make you see, baby

If you needed somebody, ah the way that I need you,
Baby tonight 
If you wanted somebody 
Yeah, the way that I want you

Ooh, if I could tell you now
The way you make me feel
Ooh, if I could show you somehow
Don't you know my loving is ... 
Love so real

Yeah, if you needed somebody, ah the way that I need you, baby tonight
If you wanted somebody, ooh ooh, yeah the way that I want you, yeah
I need you, I want you, I gotta tell you
Ah, the way that I need you
If you wanted somebody
Yeah, the way that I want you
Yeah, If you needed somebody
If you needed somebody baby now yeah
The way that I need you---Lyrics submitted by Rhonda.
