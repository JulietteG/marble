The neon lights go flashing by
Electric Land is in my eyes
The underworld is on the move
And everybody's got something to prove

The taxi driver delivers the news
Somebody out there has blown a fuse
We're passing the scene a man is dead
A thirty eight blew away his head

A jolt of lightning set's me back a pace
Feel like a visitor from outer space
Please excuse me if I don't quite understand
I'm just a stranger in Electric Land

Willing to have a good time
You live for the moment the moment is fine
You're up in your room the lights are low
Nefore you know it's time for the show

A jolt of lightning set's me back a pace
Feel like a visitor from outer space
Please excuse me if I don't quite understand
I'm just a stranger in Electric Land---
