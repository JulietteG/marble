I've been alone since I don't know when, and I don't need another lover
I just don't know if I could follow again, it's been gettin' me down

And I never dreamt we could be, something happened and I can't walk away
How could I know I'd get in too deep, I'm not fooling around

Hey baby, I'm scared of letting it out

Ooh, this could be the one
Ooh, this could be the one, I'm not fooling around

Wherever I go, I think of you, I can't believe what I am feeling
And how could I know I'd be losing sleep, I'm not fooling around

Hey baby, we need time to figure this out

Ooh, this could be the one - the one that I've been waiting for
Ooh, this could be the one - and I'm not fooling around

I worry if we get too close, you kick my heart around
If love is what you need the most, don't tear my feelings down

(Solo)

Hey baby, I've been hurt before, hey, hey baby, this time I've got to be sure

Ooh, this could be the one - that I've been waiting for
Ooh, this could be the one - the one I've been waiting for

Ooh, this could be the one - this could be, this could be the one
Ooh, this could be the one - the one that I've been waiting for...---Lyrics submitted by Polly.
