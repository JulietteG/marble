1ST
 if weakness is a wound,
that no one wants to speak of.
then cool is just how far we have to fall.
And i am not immune,
 i only want to be loved.
but i feel safe behind the firewall.

PRE-CHORUS
and i will lose my need to impress,
 if you want the truth.
 i need to confess.
CHORUS
I'm not alright,
i'm broken inside, 
broken inside.
and all i go through,
it leads me to you,
it leads me to you.
2ND

Burn away the pride, bring me to my weakness,
'till everything to hide behind is gone.
and when i'm open wide, with nothing left to cling to,
only you are there to lead me on!
cuz honestly, i'm not that strong.

CHORUS

I'm not alright, i'm broken inside, 
broken inside.
And all i go through, it leads me to you,
it leads me to you.

BRIDGE

And now i move,
And now i move,
And now i move,
closer to you.

And now i move,
And now i move,
closer to you.

And now i move,
And now i move,
And now i move,
closer to you.

And now i move,
And now i move,
And now i move...

CHORUS

I'm not alright, i'm broken inside, 
broken inside.

I'm not alright, i'm broken inside, 
broken inside.

And all i go through, it leads me to you,
it leads me to you.

I'm not alright,
I'm not alright,
I'm not alright,
that's why i need you.---Lyrics submitted by kitkat.
