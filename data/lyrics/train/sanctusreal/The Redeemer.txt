Sometimes I just wanna start over
 Cuz everything looks like a wreck
 And I need the courage to carry on
 Cuz I cant see whats ahead

And there are places Ive wished I could be
 Battles Ive wanted to win
 Dreams that have slipped through my hands
 I may never be back again

But Im still a dreamer
 A believer
 Oh, I lost my faith in so many things
 But I still believe in You
 Cuz You can make anything new

Sometimes I just wish we could say
 All the things that are easy to hear
 Ignore the injustice we see
 And explain every unanswered prayer
 But Id rather speak honestly
 And wear a tattered heart on my sleeve
 Cuz in the middle of my broken dreams
 Redemption is here

And Im still a dreamer
 A believer
 Oh, I lost my faith in so many things
 But I still believe in You
 Cuz You are the answer
 The Redeemer
 Oh, Ive given up on too many things
 But Im not giving up on You
 Cuz You can make anything new

I dont have every answer in life
 But Im trusting You one day at a time
 Cuz You can make a weak heart stay alive
 Forever
 And this is where heaven and earth collide
 I lift my hands, I give my life
 This is how my weary heart stays alive

Oh, Im still a dreamer
 Still a believer
 And You are the answer
 The Redeemer
 Cuz You can make anything new
 Yeah, You can make anything new---Lyrics submitted by Katrina.
