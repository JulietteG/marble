What will they say when Im gone?
In words that Ive written in stone
Under my name 
What will they claim about me?

Well I wanna leave a legacy 
To be remembered 
More than just a memory
That fades a way 
Because we are we are
Yeah one life

Free me my hands are tied
Im so tired of wasting time
These endless inventions 
Steal my attention 
From real life
And when its done
When its over

Well I wanna leave a legacy 
To be remembered 
More than just a memory
That fades a way 
Because we are we are
Yeah one life (life life life life life)

And will the world see Christ
When they look at my life?
(what will the world see?)

Well cmon 
Give me, give me, give me real life 

And no more, no more, no more 
Wasted time 

Because we are, we are, yeah
(one life) Just one life 

Well I wanna leave a legacy 
To be remembered 
More than just a memory
That fades a way 
Because we are (get one shot, at this one life)
we are (one moment in time)
Because we are we are 
(Yeah we only get) one life 
(This one shot, this one life could rearrange, yeah rearrange)---Lyrics submitted by Rebekah.
