Remember when you couldn't wait
To show up early and find your place
Cause you didn't want to miss a thing
And your heart was open, ready for change

Oh, those days
You were never afraid to sing
Never afraid to lift your hands
Didn't care what people would think

You were on fire
And church was more than a place
And people were more than faces
And Jesus was more than a name

Remember when you weren't ashamed
To tell your friends about your faith
A time when you felt the pain
Of just one lost soul that was slipping away
Your heart was soft
You had radiant eyes
But slowly the pressures and burdens of life
Pulled you into the dark of the night
Oh, when did you lose your sight

You were on fire
And you let life put out the flame
But He's still calling out for you
Cause He wants to light your heart again
And set it on fire
Set it on fire

Turn your eyes
Turn your eyes
And don't forget what it was like

Set me on fire
Set me on fire
I want to hold God's people close
Want to feel the power of Jesus' name
Set me on fire
Set me on fire---
