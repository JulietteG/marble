Come closer to the window-frame 
Window to the dark and the field of snow 
I saw you running like summer-flame 
Running through the grass 
Turning gold to black 

Oh, turn the dirt over 
If you want to grow back 
Oh! open up the shutters 
See the moonlight on 
The snow 
On the snow 

You left your brother in a northern town 
Took the ferry o'er the water on the bay 
His body covered by the colors going down 
A statue in the square before the wind could change 

Oh, turn the water over 
If you want to flow down 
Oh! open up the shutters 
See the falling snow 
The falling snow 

Come softly to the window frame 
Window through the dark and the fields of snow 
I saw you running like a summer-flame 
Running through the grass 
Turning gold to black 

Oh, turn the dirt over 
If you want to grow back 
Oh, open up the shutters 
See the moonlight on 
The snow 
See the moonlight on 
The snow 
On the snow---
