Good morning dear
I hope i didn't wake you too soon
Because my mind is growing tired
Too much thinking what I should do

I picture you out there
It must be beautiful this time of year
All those east coast leaves
Flowing 'round like embers from burning trees

Well the the weather here's just the same
But the garden that you planted remains.

Now it's work
Each day bleeding into the next
Barely scraping by
I tire myself out just so I rest

But rest it rarely comes
When it does I cannot go home.
Because it's much too quiet
Seems that I'm not suited to being alone

And everyone around me's changed
But the garden that you planted remains.

I think about you
Maybe more than I should
But the smog is getting old
The drugs aren't taking on so good

So will you talk to me?
Even though you've had a late night
Because I need a little help
Baby, tell me I'll be alright

Cause everything around me's changed
But the garden that you planted remains...---Lyrics submitted by Fiona.
