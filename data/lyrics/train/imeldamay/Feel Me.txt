Baby, baby can I talk to you
I don't know what to do with myself
(If anything is)?? pity isn't my thing
But I really could do with some help

Pull it together
Hold your head up high
Get on with life as you do
But that doesn't happen
when I'm cut up inside
Hurtin' and cryin' over you, oh

Feel me, Feel me
Feel what I'm feeling inside
See me, See me
See all this hurt in my eyes

You've hurt me like never before
Dragged my heart from heaven to the floor
No matter what you do from now
won't be the same anymore, no

Feel me, Feel me
Feel what I'm feeling inside
See me, See me
See all this hurt in my eyes, oh


**Instrumental Break**


Baby your sorry, I'm sorry too
Believe it when I'm talking to you
That I'm so sad that you couldn't turn to me
Instead of finding somebody new
I'm no angel, that I never claim
But I thought I was nobody's fool
But I'm still yours babe and your still mine
I don't know how it works now, do you?

Feel me, Feel me
Feel what I'm feeling inside
See me, See me
See all this hurt in my eyes

You've hurt me like never before
Dragged my heart from heaven to the floor
No matter what you do from now
won't be the same anymore
No, no, no, no-no-no-oh-oh,
No, no, no-oh-oh-oh
No, no, no-no-no-oh-oh
No, no---Lyrics submitted by jaisfem.
