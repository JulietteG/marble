He got me with a hook
Those big bass notes
Thunder in my chest
mmm, stuck in my throat
Pulling me down
Like a rumble in the ground
Crawls up from the depths
With a deep down sound

(CHORUS)
Johnny got a boom boom
Johnny got a bamm
He got a...

Big bomb body
Lonely neck
Swear it was a women
That he had in his grip
Big vibrations yeah
Just one glance
He gonna blow my mind
He's gonna make me wanna
Make me wanna ohh

(CHORUS)

Watch that man
See whats in his hands
Got no joy
He's a big bad boy

He's gonna freak you out
Your gonna shriek out loud
He's got ya in his hands
He's gonna make ya wanna
Make ya wanna ohhh

(CHORUS)

Watch that man
See whats in his hands
Got no joy
He's a big bad boy

He's gonna freak you out
Your gonna shriek out loud
He's got ya in his hands
Gonna make ya wanna
Make ya wanna ohh

Johnny got a boom boom oh yeah
Johnny got a bamm
I said that johnny got a boom boom
Ohh yeah johnny got a
He got a, he got a, he got a---Lyrics submitted by koi.
