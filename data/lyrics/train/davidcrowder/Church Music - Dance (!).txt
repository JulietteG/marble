Dance if you're wounded
Dance if you're torn into
Dance broken open
Dance with nothing to lose

Dance when you're wounded
Dance when you're torn into
Dance broken open
Dance with nothing to lose

(Oh!) Perfectly free
(Oh!) Dance if you wanna be
(Oh!) Perfectly free
(Oh!) Dance if you wanna be

Change the world
Change your soul
Fill it up
Here we go
Here we go

Oh His is a story that saves
Majestic feel
Feel it at a steady pace---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
