Ooh, it's over, over
Nothing left to do
You know that it's over, over

I need space, let me decide
Where to go from here before I lose my mind
We both know it's for the best, till then
I'm counting on the sun that's gonna shine

Till then the darkest clouds stay over me
And I'm torn apart that you're so over me
I'm so over you, not even knowing me at all
I shoulda never made this call

To say to you
You know that it's over, it's over
Nothing left to do
You know that it's over, no

I've left before and you the same
This time it feels as if the end is here again
I know the truth so let me cry
Take half the blame for what's become of you and I

So here's my heart so broken 'cause of you
And I don't know why I'm so in love with you
And it's tearing me apart that I would never know at all
If I'd have never made this call

She began to tell me all the things you don't
Like how y'all still together and leaving you, she won't
How am I supposed to deal when pain is all I feel?
This is all too real

I'll get out your way, boy, I don't wanna stay
I thought I could be strong
But this situation makes me hate the fact
That we can't get along

I'm supposed to be the one for you
And you're my number one
Until you're my forever we're done

You know that it's over, over
Nothing left to do
You know that it's over, over

I'm outta here, I'm outta here, it's over, over
Nothing left to do
You know that it's over, over---Lyrics submitted by Molly johnson.
