My skin feels good against you
You're touching me in places I forgot existed in me
I felt you then I melted
And it was unexpected
Baby how do you know me so well
You knew just what to do when you laid your hands on me baby
You love me like forever
Baby we just go together

It happens every time I'm in your arms
Seems like I'm putting everything on pause
I'm starting to believe your love is also want
You're all I ever need
Give me your
La la la la la la
Do do do do do

My lips I wanna kiss you
Like there's no tomorrow like the world is ending
I just wanna be with you baby
Myself I wanna give you baby
Iota because you know me so well
You knew just what to say
You whispered in my ear a promise
To love me like forever baby
Baby we just go together baby

It happens every time I'm in your arms
Seems like I'm putting everything on pause
I'm starting to believe your love is also want
You're all I ever need
Give me your
La la la la la la
Do do do do do

(Oh love)
It feels so good to me baby
(I need your love)
So damn good to me baby
(Give me your love)
La la la la la la...

It happens every time I'm in your arms
Seems like I'm putting everything on pause
I'm starting to believe your love is also want
You're all I ever need
Give me your
La la la la la la
Do do do do do

So much I wanna tell you baby
How much I really really love you baby
Don't front on me baby
You know I need your love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
