[Verse 1] 
~Frankie J~ 
Check check... this happen for real... Baby bash, yeah Frankie J... obession 
Its early in the morning and my heart is really lonely 
Just thinkin' 'bout you baby, got me twisted in the head 
And I don't how to take it, but its driving me so crazy 
I don't know if its right I'm tossin, turnin, in my bed 
Its 4 o clock in the morning, I still can't sleep 
Thinkin 'bout your beauty it makes me weak 
I'm feeling hopeless in my home 
I don't know what to do 
I think I'm in love baby 

[Chorus] 
Amor no es amor (if this aint love) 
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feeling) 
What am I doing wrong? 
Amor no es amor (if this aint love) 
Its just an illusion (its just an illusion) 
That I have in my heart 

[Verse 2] 
Now I know shes not my lady 
But I'm trying to make this right 
I dont know what to do I'm going out of my mind 
So baby if you let me 
I could kick it with you well maybe 
We could ride together we can do this all night 
(Baby Bash: fo' sho') 
Now I don't care if you got a man 
Baby I'd wish you'd understand 
That I know he can't love you right 
Quite like I can 
Its 5 o clock in the morning 
I still cant sleep 
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me weak 
Im feeling hopeless at home 
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3] 
Oooh I love the way you freak it like that 
Oooh I love the way you freak it like that 
Oooh I love the way you freak it like that 
Its an obsession 

~Baby Bash~ 
Hold up, let me dream 
Shorty got me feelin serene 
Where my candy where my cream 
Got your boy feelin' supreme 
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent 
Lovin everything your representing 
Got alot of money and i love to spend it 
And thats whats up and I dont care what people scream 
Your my blessing when im stressin 
My superfly beauty queen 
I'ma keep it saucy 
Cause mama know how I do 
We go rendezvous, my corazon belong to you 

[Chorus x2] 

Amor---
