[chorus:]
she got a caramel round round brown
make me go crazy when she come around
baby you's my butta cup
ohh I got a sweet tooth
baby you's my butta cup
ohh I got a sweet tooth
when she got those skinny jeans ridin down low
she's my favorite candy gotta let her know
baby you's my butta cup
ohh I got a sweet tooth
baby you's my butta cup
ohh I got a sweet tooth

yeah you crossin out yo label girl you bustin all night
not a top notch top rank or top flight
but it aint a butta finga or it aint a babe ruth
got ya dancin way loose like you off the grey goose
caramel dummy's on my mind on the frappachino
betty crocker dunkin hines taste like rios
her body so cleo colder then alaska
break me off slow she gone break me off faster
and you know she broke me off from the south to the north
east to the west booty do it so soft
got me singin boy yoy boy yoy
she got that goody gum drop oh boy

[chorus]

less feelin taste great thats my thang
honey buns dum dums coconut cream
cut her up clean cuz she sweeter than my swisha
I give her cap a key everytime I get wit her
shes my cover girl lover girl sweet as amaretto
lookin some vicious when she do it in stiletto
hip hop or heavy metal she workin that jello
and she love to bring it home and help me count my spineto
she kisses for my lady cadaver
aint got a square (?) gots me a ryder
put her on the flyer betcha club jump off right
guarantee she gone keep it bumpin all night

[chorus]

let me see ya goody goody gum drop
thicka then a snicka with her body off the liquor
let me see ya goody goody gum drop
if your sexy and you know it and your not afraid to show it
let me see ya goody goody gum drop
and get your frame off the chain make em say main
let me see ya goody goody gum drop
