The Dame's Like a Butterfly
Movin' from side to side
Shakin' that thing in front of my eyes
How about a little taste, would you mind?

Ever had someone, that caught your eye
You get all messed up
Everything is a high
I try and run
But can't get away
I made her the Sun
That shines over me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she can bring me higher
Better than most
and I wanted to be alone
but wherever i go..

[Chorus]
She gives me butterflies
The sweetest feelin' i've ever known
I'm fallin'
So unbelievable

It's in my mind
And flows right down to my toes
I guess I'm fallin'
So unbelievable

The Dame's Like a Butterfly
Movin' from side to side
Shakin' that thing in front of my eyes
How about a little taste, would you mind?

She winds me up
Then shuts me down
They say Wussup?
"Karl, you should look around!"
You don't wanna know
The places she'd be"
It's all for show
Just wait and see

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

The Dame's Like a Butterfly
Movin' from side to side
Shakin' that thing in front of my eyes
How about a little taste, would you mind? [x2]
