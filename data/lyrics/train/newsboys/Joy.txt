You give me joy that's unspeakable
And I like it, And I like it
Your love for me is irresistible
I can't fight it, I can't fight it

If life is water, I was dry as Tuscon dirt
If it's a gamble, I'd already lost my shirt
If it's a journey, I was dazed without a clue
I flipped a 'U' back to the first love I ever knew

CHORUS
You give me joy that's unspeakable
And I like it, And I like it
Your love for me is irresistible
I can't fight it, I can't fight it
You carried the cross and took my shame
I believe it, I believe it
You shine Your light of amazing grace
I recieve it, I receive it

If life's a battle, the invasion is complete
If it's a rhythm, I have found the perfect beat
If it's a renaissance, I've got a new birthday
The world don't give it
And the world can't take it away

CHORUS

I'm bowed and broken, everything's new
All that I need, You're like water to seed
And how Your love, rights everything wrong
And in my weakness
You're ever stronger, You're pulling me back
Where I belong
