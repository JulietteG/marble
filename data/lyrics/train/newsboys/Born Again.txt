Found myself looking into the mirror
Knew I wasn't who I wanted to be
I was living like the way that I wanted
But my eyes reminded me I'm not free
Believe that I saw, everything that I know
Says I gotta go, tired of going solo
But I'm never gonna go there again

This is what it is
This is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't want to fall 
But I don't have to crawl
I met the one with two scarred hands
Givin' him the best of 
Everything that's left of
The life inside this man
I've been Born Again

I see you're walking like you're living in fear
Having trouble even looking at me
Wishing that they give you more than words
Sick of people telling how it should be (how it should be)
What's your download, where'd you get your info
Saw that I'm show, now you're in the in-load
I'm gonna tell you what I believe, OH

This is what it is
This is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't want to fall 
But I don't have to crawl
I met the one with two scarred hands
Givin' him the best of 
Everything that's left of
To live inside this man
I've been Born Again

We are the ones, he called by name
I'm never gonna look back
Let go, let go the guilt, the shame
I said I'm never gonna look back
This is who I am

This is what it is
This is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't want to fall
But I don't have to crawl
I met the one with two scarred hands
Givin' him the best of 
Everything that's left of
To live inside this man
I've been Born Again

This is what it is
This is who I am
This is where I finally take my stand
I didn't want to fall
But I don't have to crawl
I met the one with two scarred hands
Givin' him the best of 
Everything that's left of
To live inside this man
I've been Born Again

I've been Born Again---
