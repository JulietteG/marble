Time after time
Its all the same
I forget who I am
I take Your place
The bigger I get
The harder I fall
I act like I dont need You at all
And one by one
My bridges burn
Until Ive nowhere left to turn
But its You whos right there for me
And its You who writes my story
I need an earthquake
To shake me until it breaks me down
Im giving You everything
My prides crashing to the ground
Shatter my walls
Let my kingdom fall
I dont wanna wear this crown no more
My heart is Yours to take
Its You that can save me
Its You that can shake me
I need an earthquake
I need an earthquake
Ive lived on the edge
For way too long
Walking a tightrope on my own
When out of the dark
I heard You call
Now, into Your hands I surrender all
So take my heart and shape it up
To build me into what You want
Cause its You who sees right through me
Youre the only one that moves me
I lift my hands
I lift my hands high
My heart is open
My heart is open wide
Show me life
Show me a new life
Where all thats left
Where all thats left is You and I---
