You search me You know me You see my every move
There's nothing i could ever do hide myself from You
You know my thoughts, my fears and hurts,
my weaknesses and pride
You know what i am going through,
and how i feel inside..

But even though You know, 
You will always love me
Even though You know
You'll never let me go
I don't deserve Your love
But You give it freely
You will always love me
Even though You know

(Repeat)

You will always love me
Even though You know...---Lyrics submitted by jewel.
