Heart of mine... heart of mine
Whatcha gonna do with your lonely self this time

Well you went and did it this time
When you heard temptation call
Shame won't let you walk back
And pride won't let you crawl 

She'll cry when she finds out
She'll tell us both to leave
And even though you're guilty
She'll blame it all on me

Heart of mine...oh heart of mine
Whatcha gonna do with your lonely self this time
Cross that line
You had to cross that line
I must have fool to listen to you heart of mine

How can ya keep on beatin' 
Actin' like there's nothing wrong
Can't you feel the sorrow 
Are you made of stone

What were you thinkin' of
Ya must have been out of my mind
Oh why must I be shackled
To you heart of mine

Heart of mine... oh heart of mine
Whatcha gonna do with your lonely self this time
Cross that line
You had to cross that line
I must have been a fool to listen to you heart of mine

Heart of mine... oh heart of mine
Whatcha gonna do with your lonely self this time
Cross that line
You had to cross that line
I must have been a fool to listen to you heart of mine

Heart of mine...oh heart of mine
Whatcha gonna do with your lonely self this time
Cross that line
You had to cross that line
I must have been a fool to listen to you heart of mine

I must have been a fool to listen to you heart of mine---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
