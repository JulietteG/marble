If you wanna lead, be a leader
If you wanna dream, be a dreamer
Climb to the top of that mountain and scream it
But remember when you get to the top
Everything you say is gonna matter
Everything you do is gonna add up
It's what you asked for
So don't get mad when it's not what you thought
Careful now, girl, with them Jezebel ways
Crown on your head, but you're queen of cliches
Little one playin' with the big boys now
Hope you're ready when it comes back around

I had a dream that we were born
A generation to behold
Writing fires with our words
Instead of useless smoke that blurs
The lines of right and wrong
Expression that they're told
An army with a sword
That lingers when we're gone
I had a dream

If you wanna preach be a preacher
If you wanna teach be a teacher
Remember that the footprints you're leaving
Will tell us all who you really are
It's too bad you can't see what you're worth
Spreadin' your legs 'stead of usin' your words
Character is shown by the things that we do
The one thing you're never gonna hide is the truth
Cause anyone can tell when you're sellin' out
And anyone can fly when they're fallin' down---
