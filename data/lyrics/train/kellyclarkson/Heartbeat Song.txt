This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long

You, where the hell did you come from?
You were a different, different kind of fun
And still used to feel it now
Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating whats to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Havent felt for a long time

This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and Im gonna play it
Turn it on
But I know you can take it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long

I, I wasnt even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I dont know where Id be know

Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
And I could do this for a long time

Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I cant believe Ill ever breathe without you
Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time, one more time---
