I really hate to let this moment go
touching your skin and your hair falling slow
when a good bye kiss
feels like this

don't you wanna stay here little while?
don't you wanna hold each other tight?
don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
don't you wanna stay here little while?
we can make forever feel this way
don't you wanna stay

let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last
When you're up this high, it's a sad goodbye

don't you wanna stay here little while?
don't you wanna hold each other tight?
don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
don't you wanna stay here little while?
we can make forever feel this way
don't you wanna stay

will you feel so good ?
will you feel so good ?

don't you wanna stay here little while?
don't you wanna hold each other tight?
don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
don't you wanna stay here little while?
we can make forever feel this way
don't you wanna stay?

don't you wanna stay?
yeah yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by AlirezaRahimzad.
