Maybe no one told you
there is strength in your tears
and so you fight to
keep from pouring out.

But what if you unlock the gate
That keeps your secret soul.
Do you think that theres enough 
You might drown?

[Chorus]
If no one will listen,
If you decide to speak.
If no one is left standing
after the bombs explode.
If no one wants to look at you
For what you really are..
I will be here still.

No one can tell you,
Where you alone must go.
Theres no telling,
What youll find there.

And god I know the fear
That eats away at your bones.
Screaming every step,
Just stay here.

[Chorus]

If you find your fists are raw and red,
From beating yourself down.
If your legs have given out,
Under the weight.
If you find that youve been settling
for a world of gray.
So you wouldnt have to face down
Your own hate.

[Chorus: x2]

I will be here still..---Lyrics submitted by cheryl.
