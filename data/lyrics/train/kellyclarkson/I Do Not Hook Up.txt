Oh, sweetheart put the bottle down, you got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure you've found it
Slow motion sparks
You caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys 
Oh, yes they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're lookin' for thrills then get cold feet
     (CHORUS)
Oh, No, I do not hook up, up
I go slow 
So if you want me I don't come cheap
Keep your head on my hand 
Your heart on your sleeve
Oh, No, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight to say 
Goodnight

I can't cook no, but I can clean up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beat, as I kiss your forehead
This may not last but this is now, so love the one you're with
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well!
      (CHORUS)
'Cause I feel 
The distance between us
Could be over with a snap of your finger
Oh,No!
      (CHORUS)
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight to say
Goodnight
Oh, Sweetheart put the bottle down,
'Cause you don't wanna miss out...---Lyrics submitted by Ali.
