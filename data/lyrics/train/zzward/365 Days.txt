Your clothes out on the blacktop 
Scattered suits on the street 
Frames and broken pictures in the mid-September heat 
We set these nights on fire 
So hot, we burned it down 
Now all that's left of us is ashes on the ground 

I told you back in June 
You knew damn well what I would do 

Three hundred sixty five days 
You been making me wait 
So keep your two-timing games 
It's a lot of too late 
The summer's over, over, over 
Over, over, over 

Drop your keys from six stories 
Shout out "It's raining green" 
Don't tell lies in heaven or an angel will get mean 
Diamonds and white gold watches 
Watch how fast they will sore 
You always said you wanted to give back to the poor 

I told you back in June 
You knew damn well what I would do 

Three hundred sixty five days 
You been making me wait 
So keep your two-timing games 
It's a lot of too late 
The summer's over, over, over 
Over, over, over 

I won't be your debutante 
Won't be the fool to your savant 
I can't fix your cracked up dreams 
While the leaves fall off these trees  
I won't spend the winter nights 
Holding on to would and right 
You might break your words real fast 
But mine are made to last 

Three hundred sixty five days 
You been making me wait 
So keep your two-timing games 
It's a lot of too late 
The summer's over, over, over 
Over, over, over 

Three hundred sixty five days 
You been making me wait 
So keep your two-timing games 
It's a lot of too late 
The summer's over, over, over 
Over, over, over now 

Over now---
