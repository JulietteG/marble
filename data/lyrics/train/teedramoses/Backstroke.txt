Intro
Ooooh..

ooh ooh..
oh uh uh ohh.. oh uh uh ohh
Ohh your backstroke..

Picture me in one of those two seater things..
Top down.. so thoughts of you were in th breeze..
And the wind.. And the wind..
And the wind.. Wind is in my hair..
Lord each time they say you'll get me back around..
You get me back around..
And i know you bring me down
But still some time you seem to get me hi..high

Chorus
Oh Papi.. i sit and.. think about.. all of the.. things that we
go through and now..
And i  wonder why i stay with you but there's..
Something in your backstroke..
And it keeps me into to you..
Something in your backstroke..

Here it is..
Imma make it play.. 
Imma lay it on the line..
Mostly i feel you just of waste of my time..
But ooh i want you..
(I want you)
i.. i got to have you..
really do need you 
And i was thinking

About you..
Oh Papi.. i sit and.. think about.. all of the things.. that we
go through and now..
And i wonder why i stay with but there's..
Something in your backstroke..
And it keeps me into you..
Something in your backstroke..

Bridge

Wooo.. Wooo Woooo..
And it keeps me after you..
And it keeps me after you..
And it keeps me after you..
And it keeps me after youuuuuuuu..
I can't do this forever..
But right now i'd rather give it and get your love tonight..


Chorus

Oh Papi.. I sit and.. think about.. all of the.. things that we..
Go through and now..
And i wonder why i stay with you but there's..
Something in your backstroke..
And i keeps me into you..
Something in your backstroke

Woo.. ooh Papi..
