No one was crying
They simply got a little something in their eye
No one was lonely
They just could not get hold of anybody
Over the summer, a lot changed
And they all changed to keep up with it
Too complicated
Too complex to talk to anybody

Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Rolling shadow)
Marks to prove it, got the marks to prove it (Fallen arrow)

All this is sky light
Forget that it's there but it's there, no doubt about it
Take it for a walk, they come back
[?], wondering why it took it
Thousands of people
Tight lines and ropes and weather stays the weekend
Clouds and rain
And no one cares, they got the marks to prove it

Rolling shadow, fallen arrow---
