When you break free
The powers that be
Have failed to discover
The lies we believe

Your mind is clear
Of things that you fear
They fade with how much you
Believe what you hear

Don't let them get away with it
Yeah
Don't let them get away with it

And don't you know
You reap what you sow
The ones now in power
Are the ones who we chose

Oh how they try
To make us choose sides
But it's more than a question
Of who's wrong and right

Don't let them get away with it
Yeah
Don't let them get away with it
Yeah
Don't let them get away with it
Don't let them get away with it---Lyrics submitted by John.
