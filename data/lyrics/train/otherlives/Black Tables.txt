When the whites of your eyes come through
You'll see something new
With your body and mine raised up
It's good to see you back home

When the life in your eyes wants black
Things return
You've come back
With your body and mine raised up
It's good to see you once more

Turn black tables
And your turning black tables
And your making your head blur
Making your head blur
And your turning black tables
And your turning black tables
And your making your head blur
Making your head blur---Lyrics submitted by Doctor.
