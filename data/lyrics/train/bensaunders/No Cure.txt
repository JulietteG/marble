Loneliness be quiet
The silence sounds so loud tonight
I'm out tonight
And if this heart would work
Then I would feel the hurt tonight
It's worth the try

I try to break it
But it's not breaking
I try to fake it
But there's no faking
I've took your pictures down
But your still in my line of sight

'Cause it won't stop bleeding
But I can't feel it, no
There is no pill for it, pill for it
And give me something
To lose this nothing, ooh
I'd kill for it, kill for it
And feel, feel something real
I'd kill for a broken heart

When you can't see the pain
The cure's invisible, it's not physical
Can't go no further down, down
But I need to fall, I need to fall
I put a sign up, but it says vacant
But I keep waiting 'till this space is taken
Trapped inside of me
I need another place to be, tonight

'Cause it won't stop bleeding
But I can't feel it, no
There is no pill for it, pill for it
And give me something
To lose this nothing, ooh
I'd kill for it, kill for it
And feel, feel something real
I'd kill for a broken heart
And feel, feel something real

Just to feel, just to feel
That it's beating again
Let it hurt, let it hurt
Let the pain in again
Break it up, break it down
But just break it
'Cause I can't feel it, oh, oh

'Cause it won't stop bleeding
But I can't feel it, no
There is no pill for it, pill for it
And give me something
To lose this nothing, ooh
I'd kill for it, kill for it
And feel, feel something real
I'd kill for a broken heart

And feel something real
I'd kill for a broken heart, ooh, oh, oh
I can feel it, I can feel it, yeah, yeah
I'd kill for a broken heart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
