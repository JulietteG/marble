Ooh yea (x4)
How you feeling? How you feeling? People, take it easy cant you see that Im busy now
Ive got a knack for some trouble believe me, and lately Ive been trying to block it out
Ive got a strange little other side, a temptation that I try to hide
Just like a pretty girl saying do or die *that's right*
Oh, And I can tell when I look at you
Oh, That youve been going what Im going through
The same thing happens, the same thing happens
But Ive been thinking I can be a better man see
Instead of taking life for granted I feel lucky to be alive, good how Ill feel inside
And from now on were taking big strides

Ooh yea (x4)

Hold up, now yes Im on something great, if you know you relate, no ones perfect
And if you think you cant count your mistakes, think again, cuz I know that you can
Dear sir, Im pretty sure that we grow every day based on simple mistakes that we make *like*
There aint no easy way, *say it again,* there aint no easy way
Oh, And I can tell when I look at you
Oh, You know exactly what Im going through
The same thing happens, the same thing happens
But you keep thinking you can be this better man see
Instead of taking life for granted youll feel lucky to be alive, good how youll feel inside
And from now on were taking big strides.

Ooh yea And all through real life it goes like
Ooh yea (x7)---Lyrics submitted by 19paulix31.
