I can see the sun come up
time to get away from here
time to make a new plan up again
water never felt this good
and air had never felt so pure
time to make a new plan up again 

oh I want more
I'll start what I came here for
And all I really want is to be free 
mhhmmmmmm
Cold to warm
I'll start what I came here for 
And all I really want is to be free 
mhmmmmmmmmmm

Well now that I've come this far
I'll never lookin' back nooo
Time to make a new plan up again
Things have never looked this clear
I'll never lookin' back nooo
Time to make a new plan up again

Well I want more
I'll start what I came here for 
An' all I want is to be free
mhhhmmmmmm
Cold to warm
I'll start what I came here for
An' all I want is to be free 
mhhmmmmmmm---Lyrics submitted by Jeffrey Selwa.
