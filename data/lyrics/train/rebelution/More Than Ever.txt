Just like i said before
Give me two weeks when i get home i'll come and say hello
With lots of kisses for you misses how i miss you so
Be home forever nothin better than to see you though
And tell me how ya been
Don't act surprised this is how i am
I'm feelin' good and thats real

[CHORUS]
You and me should kick it more than ev more than ever more than ev
Remember me and you
Remember me and you
Remember me and you
Remember me and you

Remember when we'd sit
Talk face to face and wonder whether we'd be fakin it and chat for hours 
About the leftest side of government 
I'd sit and listen to your words and i'd be lovin it
Now the times have changed
Older but we always stay the same
I'm fillin up the whole lane

[CHORUS]

yeah la la la la la yeah
la la la la la yeah
la la la la la yeah
la la la la la yeah
la la la la la yeah
la la la la la yeah
la la la la la yeah---Lyrics submitted by shelsea.
