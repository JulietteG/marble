Express to de-stress 
I'm innocent 
And I feel blessed 
Now in effect 
To unify, connect 
Love the innovation 
That I accept 
And we let it run 

Yeah, that's how we bring it 
Now in effect through the chest when I sing it 
I'm innocent but guilty when I kill it 
Feel free to flee real fast when I feel it 

And I might stress 
Yes I might stress, too blessed to be stressed
Yes I might stress, too blessed to be stressed 
Yes I might stress, too blessed to be stressed  

When I say yeah all stay put 
Put them back in their place now look 
I got 'em locked with the sound just dropped 
and I'm bringing it sick with a rhyme top notch 

Aw yeah, that's how we're living 
Express to de-stress when I'm in it 

I'm mic blessed, never cursed trying to get it so 
Express to de-stress when I feel it 

Aw yeah, that's how we're living 
Express to de-stress when I'm in it 

I'm mic blessed, never cursed trying to get it so 
I'm ready for the action 
bring on the traction 

Aw yeah, tell me how you're livin 
De-stress 
Come on let me get a sit in 

When I'm low I put a spice in the rhythm 
and I put a little sugar on the life that I'm livin 

That's right I let my eyes shut light 
Start bright to suddenly turn night 
Good thing I got my voice on mics 
In the zone trying to reach higher heights 

And I might stress 
Yes I might stress, too blessed to be stressed
Yes I might stress, too blessed to be stressed 
Yes I might stress, too blessed to be stressed

When I say yeah all stay put 
Put them back in their place now look 
I got 'em locked with the sound just dropped 
and I'm bringing it sick with a rhyme top notch 

Aw yeah, that's how we're living 
Express to de-stress when I'm in it 

I'm mic blessed, never cursed trying to get it so 
Express to de-stress when I feel it 

Aw yeah, that's how we're living 
Express to de-stress when I'm in it 

I'm mic blessed, never cursed trying to get it so 
I'm ready for the action 
bring on the traction ---
