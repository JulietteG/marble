Because youre living an illusion
I cant wait till it hits ya
Recollection, your misconception
Obsessed, you say the green is success
Well material gain causes serious stress
More love
Because youre living an illusion
Wake up now yes youre living in confusion
Youre not a scholar
Youre a waste of a teacher
Preach the dollars
Youre a waste of a preacher

Love
Come on, thats what we need
More love
Thats what we need to succeed
Not dollars
Nah, not what we need
Lets give em love so the youth can achieve

Yep you gotta see clearer
Clear on up, stay up, and stay clear of
Go back to basics, look in the mirror
Youre in a dream wake up and now gear up
Come on
Love, continually loving thats realer
Make up your mind and emerge as a leader
Now it connects, many many all feed off
Rise up above, cuz the youths they feed off love ---
