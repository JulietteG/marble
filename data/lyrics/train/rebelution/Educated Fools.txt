We see their faces on the television screen
Telling us these lies if you know what I mean
Why do we follow? Why do we believe?
The words that they say when we know they deceive

So here's an opportunity to see the big picture
Don't fortune these fake idols and fixtures
We're coming up now, excuse me Mr.
This is our time to shine

We know they do not know what they do
But they lie every day to me and you
These educated fools

These politicians
Are on a mission
Telling us lies through the television
Another string being pulled
By these educated fools
Who have the money
To get what they want
Now it's time we give them what they need
So come on people
This is our mission
Open up your eyes and see

We know they do not know what they do
But they lie every day to me and you
These educated fools---Lyrics submitted by chris jah.
