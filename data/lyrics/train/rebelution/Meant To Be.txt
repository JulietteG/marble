(feat. Jacob Hemphill) 

I can see the sun come up 
Time to get away from here 
Time to make a new plan up again 
Water never felt this good 
Air it never felt so pure 
It's time to make a new plan up again 

Well it was true when I said it 
I'd rather forget it 
Well the past don't matter now 
You think I owe you, but I gotta go 
You see the past don't matter now 

And it feels like life is taking over 
It feels like it's meant to be 
And it feels like life is taking over 
It feels like it's meant to be 

'Cause I can see the sun rise on my way 
I can see the road rise to meet me 
I can feel the earth underneath my feet 
And I can see the stars on top of me 
And I say don't ever come down, come down 
I need your light now, right now 
Don't ever come down, come down 
I need your light now, right now 

Now that I have come so far 
I'm never looking back, no 
Its time to make a new plan up again 
Things have never looked so clear 
I'm never looking back, no 
Time to make a new plan up again 

'Cause I can see the sun rise on my way 
I can see the road rise to meet me 
I can feel the earth underneath my feet 
And I can see the stars on top of me 
And I say don't ever come down, come down 
I need your light now, right now 
Don't ever come down, come down 
I need your light now, right now 

And it feels like life is taking over 
It feels like it's meant to be 
And it feels like life is taking over 
It feels like it's meant to be 

Well it was true when I said it 
I'd rather forget it 
Well the past don't matter now 
You think I owe you, but I gotta go 
You see the past don't matter now 

And it feels like life is taking over 
It feels like it's meant to be 
And it feels like life is taking over 
It feels like it's meant to be---
