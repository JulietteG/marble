Don't trip you know I'm always by your side
You'll be fine for the ride just be calm
Take a breath and don't cry, oh my my
Look on the bright side

Rise up now make an impact
Now get your bags packed
Think about your life, the thrill
Don't you cry oh my my 
Look on the bright side of life

Somebody told me everything's alright
That life's too short to be afraid
Just leading up to what I want to say
Living should be giving it away
You're contemplating every single day
And learning so we educate and be positive
It is what it is, come on set examples for the kids

I don't want to scare you no I don't
It's time you be a role model 
I don't want to scare you no I don't
It's time you be a role model so open up

Don't trip you know I'm always by your side
You'll be fine for the ride just be calm
Take a breath and don't cry
Look on the bright side

Rise up now make an impact
Now get your bags packed
Think about your life, the thrill
Don't you cry look on the bright side

Be kind, now keep a smile, keep your head up
And try to find a friend or a child
And encourage their life
Look on the bright side

Rise up now make an impact
Now get your bags packed
Think about your life, the thrill
Don't you cry look on the bright side of life---Lyrics submitted by Frederick David.
