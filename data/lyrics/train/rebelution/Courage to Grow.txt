This is a song for those
Who lost their hope
A long a long time ago
I know someday that you will find it somehow
Because you're not too old
To accomplish goals
And all the answers are within your soul
It's up to you, you gotta figure it out
Uh huh

Whether you want love or money
Good fortune or fame
You want a brand new card
You want the world to change
You better take some action right now, oh yes
Because there's nothing in the world that you can't get
So don't fill your life with confusion and regret
You better take some chances right now

Well you can gain the world
But for the price of your soul
Yes I know, well I know, yes I know
You can gain the world for the price of your soul
But I hope you take the road less traveled
And I hope you find the courage to grow
Well I hope you find the courage to grow

So now you're 45
And you realize
Just what you wanna do with your life
Just took some time for you to figure it out
Cause everyone one of us
Has a purpose here
Sometimes it's hidden underneath your fear
Just takes some time for the truth to come out

So whether you want love or money
Good fortune or fame
You want a brand new card
You want the world to change
You better take some action right now, oh yes
Because there's nothing in the world that you can't get
So don't fill your life with confusion and regret
You better take some chances right now

Well you can gain the world
But for the price of your soul
Yes I know, well I know, yes I know
You can gain the world for the price of your soul
But I hope you take the road less traveled
And I hope you find the courage to grow
Well I hope you find the courage to grow---
