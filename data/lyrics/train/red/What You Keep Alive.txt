You should be afraid of me
Pain is the promise I will keep
I am the whisper in the dark
I am the scream when you fall
And you will feel the pain, youll see
And I will bring the pain you need
You keep me alive (so I can hurt you)
You need me inside (Im what you keep alive)

You picked me up, you watched me shine, like a razor in your hand
And when I cut beneath your skin, you want it all again
I am the call in the night
I am the truth behind your lie
And now youll feel the pain, youll see
You keep me alive (so I can hurt you)
You need me inside (Im what you keep alive)
Turning, the knife is turning now

I cant pay this ransom (my love, my enemy)
Does any hope remain (Im swimming in your veins)
My love, my enemy (now you cant escape)
I can feel you in my veins (the pain is on its way)
And now its too late (now Im letting go)
You shouldve run away (Ill watch you suffocate)
Now you cant escape
I am the dark and I am awake

(Suffocate)

Waking, the nightmare bleeds, over
Ill fight you, your darkness, feeding
I keep you alive (so I can hurt you)
I lift the knife (Im what you keep alive)
Now you cant escape (suffocate, suffocate)
You will feel the pain (suffocate, suffocate) ---
