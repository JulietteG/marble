Fall asleep to dreams of home 
Where the waves are crashing 
The only place I've ever known 
Now the future has me 

I see the fire in the sky 
See it all around me 
I said the past is dead 
The life I had is gone 

Said I won't give up 
Until I see the sun 

Hold me now 
'Til the fear is leaving 
I am barely breathing 

Waking up and letting go 
To the sound of angels 
Am I alive or just a ghost? 
Haunted by my sorrows 

Hope is slipping through my hands 
Gravity is taking hold 

I said I'm not afraid 
That I am brave enough 
I will not give up 
Until I see the sun 

Hold me now 
'Til the fear is leaving 
I am barely breathing 

Crying out 
These tired wings are falling 
I need you to catch me 

As I burn 
As I break 
I can't take it anymore 

I return to the place where 
Where the water covers over everything 
Rescue me somehow 

Hold me now 
'Til the fear is leaving 
I am barely breathing 

Crying out 
These tired wings are falling 
I need you to catch me 

Hold me now 
'Til the fear is leaving 
I am barely breathing---Lyrics submitted by sam brockman.
