Tried to walk together
But the night was growing dark
Thought you were beside me
But I reached and you were gone

Sometimes I hear you calling
From some lost and distant shore
I hear you crying softly
For the way it was before

Where are you now? Are you lost?
Will I find you again?
Are you alone? Are you afraid?
Are you searching for me?

Why did you go? I had to stay
Now I'm reaching for you
Will you wait? Will you wait?
Will I see you again?

You took it with you when you left
These scars are just a trace
Now it wanders lost and wounded
This heart that I misplaced

Where are you now? Are you lost?
Will I find you again?
Are you alone? Are you afraid?
Are you searching for me?

Why did you go? I had to stay
Now I'm reaching for you
Will you wait? Will you wait?
Will I see you again?---Lyrics submitted by michael oneal.
