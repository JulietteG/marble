I try to run, I try to hide, from a voice I couldn't satisfy
That was me, always needing more
And letting go of all I had before,
Cause it feels like the end
A wound that I cant mend, I just cant fight any longer

You waited, til I sobered,
You came when you knew that game was over,
I didn't even want to be found

BUT YOU CHASED ME DOWN AND BROKE IN JUST WHEN,
I WAS DONE BELIEVING, SPUN ME ROUND SO CLOSE NOW,
I CAN FEEL YOU BREATHING,
SUNLIGHT BURNS INSIDE AND,
I FEEL SO ALIVE AND, HELP ME NOW, TELL ME HOW
HOW CAN THIS LAST FOREVER? Forever?

I ignored the signs, opened every door,
But I couldn't find what I searched for
I try to fight, but I turn and run,
Every move I make is the wrong one

You patiently wait for my next mistake,
I know it wont be much longer

You waited, til I sobered,
You came when you knew that game was over,
I didn't even want to be found

BUT YOU CHASED ME DOWN AND BROKE IN JUST WHEN,
I WAS DONE BELIEVING, SPUN ME ROUND SO CLOSE NOW,
I CAN FEEL YOU BREATHING,
SUNLIGHT BURNS INSIDE AND,
I FEEL SO ALIVE AND, HELP ME NOW, TELL ME HOW

How can this last forever?

You gave me so much more,
Than I could ever ask for

But I turned and followed, a road that left me hollow
And still you waited for me to come back home,
You brought me home

YOU CHASED ME DOWN AND BROKE IN JUST WHEN,
I WAS DONE BELIEVING, SPUN ME ROUND SO CLOSE NOW,
I CAN FEEL YOU BREATHING,
SUNLIGHT BURNS INSIDE AND,
I FEEL SO ALIVE AND, HELP ME NOW, TELL ME HOW

How can this last forever? Forever?---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
