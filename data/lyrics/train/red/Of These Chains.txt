So here we are at the end now
I need to leave but I only wanna stay with you
I never asked to be the one to set me free
And now the mask you wore that only I could see

Let me take you when I go, when I go
I don't wanna do this on my own, on my own
I'm breaking free but of these chains
Oh, Let this one remain
Let me take you when I go

I can still feel you here now in this cage
Every link another piece of you I saved
Afraid to open up the door to who I was before
And if I let go off these chains now
Will I float away
Can I just hold on?---
