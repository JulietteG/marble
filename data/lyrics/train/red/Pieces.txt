I'm here again
A thousand miles away from you
A broken mess
Just scattered pieces of who I am

I tried so hard
Thought I could do this on my own
I've lost so much along the way

[Chorus]
Then I see your face
I know I'm finally yours
I find everything, I thought I lost before
You call my name, I come to you in pieces
So you can make...me whole

I've come undone
But you make sense of who I am
Like puzzle pieces in your hand

[Chorus]

I've tried so hard...
So hard
I tried so hard...

[Chorus]

So you can make me whole...---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
