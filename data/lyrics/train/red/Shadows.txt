The sun has set
I close my eyes
I pretend everything's alright
Drowning in anger from all these lies
I can't pretend everything's alright

Please don't let me fall forever
Can you tell me it's over now?

There's a hate inside of me like some kind of monster
I try to save you but I can't find the answer
I'm holding on to you
I'll never let go
I need you with me as I enter the shadows

Caught in the darkness
I go blind
Can you help me find my way out?
Nobody hears me, I suffer the silence 
Can you tell me it's over now?

There's a hate inside of me like some kind of monster
I try to save you but I can't find the answer
I'm holding on to you
I'll never let go
I need you with me as I enter the shadows

I'm holding on to you
I'm holding on to you

There's a hate inside of me like some kind of monster
I try to save you but I can't find the answer
I'm holding on to you
I'll never let go
I need you with me as I enter the shadows---Lyrics submitted by Joanna.
