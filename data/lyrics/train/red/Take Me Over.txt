Traces of your voice
I know it, I know it so well
Waking in the storm
I can feel you, I can feel you with me
Can I go again
Oh your reckless, your reckless life goes
I cannot defend, this untamed heart is waiting

I am standing on the edge
Take me over, take me over
See how fast this life can change
Take me further, lead me further

Take me over, take me over

Find my life ahead
Oh I dont know, I dont know where
But Im starting on my way
Will you meet me, will you meet me there
Echoes in the night
Like a melody is haunting me
But then I meet your eyes
With the fire of a rising sun

Do you believe a life can change
Take me over, take me over---
