Take it away, I never thought Id let it grow
This cancer inside, the villain plays the victim so well
Make me believe, I drink the lies, this suicide
Just put me to sleep, fall over me

Lies, lies, lies
I taste the
Lies, lies, lies
Fight, while Im alive
I see you now
No less than light
Break, youre falling away
Gravity lies
I feel it die
Gravity dies

Buried alive, an innocence cannot withstand this
Language of lies, to poison all the words you swallow
Wait for the scream, you realize its all a lie
And still you betray, Ill throw you away

Lies, lies, lies
I drink the
Lies, lies, lies
Fight, while Im alive
I see you now
No less than light
Break, youre falling away
Gravity lies
I feel it die
Gravity dies

Fight, while Im alive
I see you now
No less than light
Break, youre falling away
Gravity lies
I feel it die

Gravity dies
I feel you now
Gravity lies
I feel it die
Your gravity dies ---
