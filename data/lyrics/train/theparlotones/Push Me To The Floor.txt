Don't stand next to me and think it
comes so easy; I am not your toy
Coz you think love is something new, 
but it is just a tool to make it alright.

Push me to the floor, don't give up
until I'm begging you for more
I'll be thinking of the time I felt inspired.

Don't stand next to me, 
i love the smell of ecstacy it makes me feel inspired
Coz you think love is like a sunrise up against you
somehow you're always right

Push me to the floor don't give up
until i'm begging you for more
I'll be thinking of the time i felt inspired
Push me to the floor, make me think 
that you're the one that I adore
it reminds me of a time i felt inspired.

Your worth is worth nothing when it's 
at someone else's cost
Fortune's not appreciated when the 
sweet stuff comes too fast

Push me to the floor don't give up 
until I'm begging you for more
I'll be thinking of the time I felt inspired
Push me to the floor; make me think 
that you're the one that i adore
it reminds me of the time i felt inspired

Your worth is worth nothing when it's 
at someone else's cost
Fortune's not appreciated when the 
sweet stuff comes too fast

Push me to the floor
dont give up until i'm begging you for more
I'll be thinking of the time, i felt inspired.---Lyrics submitted by Thembi.
