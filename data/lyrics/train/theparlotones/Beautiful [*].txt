Wish upon a falling star
the passion patrol
accept us for who we are
Weve gone and lost control, oh no

The outline of miracle
required to be traced
eliminate the need for thrills
we all need to be saved today

And you are all beautiful
and you are all magical
deserve to be adored
deserve to be adored

The science of all of this
is a parodied poem
avoid it with swinging fists
Dont want to be alone, oh no

Theres romance in bitterness,
say the borderline patrol,
differentiate happiness,
the borderline patrol

And you are all beautiful
and you are all magical
deserve to be adored
deserve to be adored

I tell you for free
this is just formula
this is just chemistry
None of this is real to me

And you are all beautiful
and you are all magical
deserve to be adored
deserve to be adored---Lyrics submitted by Jean.
