I saw an old man selling perfection
I looked coyly in your direction
I exclaimed perfection's not for sale

He tried to sell us life's instructions
You and I need no direction
Side by side we've reached our destination

We'll discover it on our own
Fireworks and waterfalls

We'll roam this world together
In our human forms forever
I promise to you girl
I'll find you in another world
We may encounter the bitter
Side by side it will not matter
Our story will be called
Fireworks and waterfalls

Waterfalls will flow
Fireworks explode
The magic & the beauty is in the mystery

You and I need no book of rules
Come on girl let's go and find our destiny

We'll discover it on our own
Fireworks and waterfalls

We'll roam this world together
In our human forms forever
I promise to you girl
I'll find you in another world
We may encounter the bitter
Side by side it will not matter
Our story will be called
Fireworks and waterfalls---Lyrics submitted by Amy.
