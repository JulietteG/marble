Trace my face while it's a happy face
when my smile fades i wanna remember this day
Passion killed by the comfort of time
I'm sorry if sorry if this makes you cry, 
but I have to speak my mind

Suck the colours from my eyes
When they lose thier sparkle and forget to shine
Remember all the times you turned me down
I'm sorry if this hurts your heart
but where's the spark, from the start?

Don't stop, don't stop
nothing lasts forever, 
soon we will be sober,
so let's laugh, talk, tickle and taste 
till the stars fall down
the stars fall down

Embrace my reflection for a little while
for if I am to love I must try love myself 
Cuddle with a cold corpse like frame
I'm sorry if my view of matrimony
seems obscure,
where's the fuel?

Don't stop, don't stop
nothing lasts forever, 
soon we will be sober,
illuminated by the blood red sign
Let's rather lament on this starlight event

Dance Dance Dance naked under starlight
there's something about this glow that flows just right
Lets make tonight last forget about the past

So lets laugh, talk, tickle and taste till the stars fall down
The stars fall down

Don't stop, don't stop
nothing lasts forever, 
soon we will be sober,
illuminated by the blood red sign

Lets fantasise before the real world comes
Crashing and colliding
like lightening's angry temperament
Bubbling teenage love time will soon be up

Don't stop don't stop
Nothing lasts forever soon we will be sober

Trace my face while its a happy face
When my smile fades and i'm old and grey
All I'll have are these moments to retrace.---Lyrics submitted by Thembi.
