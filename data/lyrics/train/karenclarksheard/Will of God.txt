[Verse 1:]
The safest place in the whole wide world 
is in the will of God,
though trials be great and the way seems hard, 
its in the will of God.

It may be on a mountain peak or in the valley low,
but wherever it may be,
if God says go, go, go.

[Verse 2:]
The Devil's loose in all the world, 
theres danger in the land,
the safest place in the whole wide world
is in the Masters hand.

It may be on the battle front
or in the prison walls,
but wherever it may be,
if God says go,
if God says go, 
if Christ says go, go, go. 

[Ending:]
It may be on the battle front,
or in the prison walls,
but wherever, wherever, wherever it may be,
if God says go, 
go, go, go, go, go.---Lyrics submitted by key-ke.
