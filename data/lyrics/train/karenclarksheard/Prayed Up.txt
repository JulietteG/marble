Everyday I'm watching on the TV about a robbery killing story
Oh we need to be prayed up
Oh we need to be prayed up
Negativity on the radio people have no shame anymore
Oh we need to be prayed up
Oh we need to be prayed up

The old Devil is on a rampage come to kill steal and destroy
Oh we need to be prayed up
Oh we need to be prayed up
You got to let him no that you got Authority
You got to name and claim the Victory
Oh we need to be prayed up
Oh we need to be prayed up

oh oh oh every weapon
Every weapon that's formed against me
Shall not work will not work shall not work oh oh oh
The blood
I have the blood of Jesus covered over me
He kept from danger both seen and unseen

I got to put the devil on a notice
I rebuke him in the name of Jesus, since we
Oh we need to be prayed up
Oh we need to be prayed up
Don't worry bout this recession no
Cause we covered in his name we need pray
Oh we need to be prayed up

oh oh oh Every weapon
Every weapon that's formed against me
Shall not work will not work shall not work oh oh oh
The blood
I have the blood of Jesus covered over me
He kept from danger both seen and unseen

I'm about to make the devil mad now
Everybody just put your hands in the air like this

Now if you in your car or in your home
Or on your job or wherever you may be
You got to serve a personal notice to the devil
And say this:

I have the power over the enemy
I can command him to take his hands off of me
I I I covered by the blood of Jesus to be set free
Hear me and we're gonna win cause he has got to flee, yeah

I got the power over the enemy
I can command him to take his hands off of me
I'm covered by the blood of Jesus to be set free
Hear me and we're and gonna win cause he has got to flee

Show up

Oh if you going through a storm hold on cause my god will
Show up
