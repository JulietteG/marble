Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready now go, cat, go

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you want to do, but uh uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

You can burn my house, steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do, but uh uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready now go, cat, go

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well it's blue, blue blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes---Lyrics submitted by tony.
