Theres something in the melodies
That the Christmas season brings
Joy and laughter in the air
Smiling faces everywhere

Old familiar melodies
Bring back special memories
They remind us
They remind us

Merrily the choirs sound
Spreading Christmas joy around
Filling hearts with cheer
May it last through all the year

Happy Christmas melodies
Bring back faded memories
They remind us
They remind us

Join us and sing
The sounds of heavn an nature ring
With family, rockin round the Christmas tree
Carols of old, of the greatest story ever told

Sing the melodies of Christmas
Sing the melodies of Christmas

Theres something bout the melodies
Of Santa Claus and Christmas trees
Favorite songs by Nat and Bing
Elvis, Josh and Celine

Its a special time of year
Bringing friends and family near
To remind us
Of love and kindness

Joyful messages you may find
Peace and happiness through all mankind
In the melodies, an offering
Of the love that flows from the Heavenly King

Raise your voice
Let us sing
Its the message that these songs can bring
Round the fire, round the tree
Singing carols merrily

Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

One more melody to sing at Christmas
One more memory of Christmas cheer

Old familiar melodies
Bring back special memories

Filling hearts with Christmas cheer
May it last through all the year

Something in the melodies
That the Christmas season brings

Joy and laughter in the air
Smiling faces everywhere

Happy Christmas melodies
Bring back faded memories---Lyrics submitted by Amaryllis.
