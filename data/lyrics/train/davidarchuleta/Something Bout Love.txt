Every night its all the same
Youre frozen by the phone
You wait, somethings changed
You blame yourself every day
Youd do it again
Every night

Theres something bout love
That breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh
It sets you free

Theres something bout love
That tears you up
Whoa oh oh oh
You still believe
When the world falls down like the rain
Itll bring you to your knees
Theres something bout love that breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh
But dont give up
Theres something bout love

When you were young
Scared of the night
Waiting for love to come along
And make it right
Your day will come, the past is gone
So take your time
And live and let live

Theres something bout love
That breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh
It sets you free

Theres something bout love
That tears you up
Whoa oh oh oh
You still believe
When the world falls down like the rain
Itll bring you to your knees
Theres something bout love that breaks your heart

Whoa oh oh oh
But dont give up
Theres something bout love

Dont fight
Dont hide
Those stars in your eyes (in your eyes)
Let em shine tonight
Let em shine tonight

Hang on
Hang in
For the ride of your life
Its gonna be alright
Hold on tight

Theres something bout love
That breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh

Theres something bout love
That breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh
It sets you free

Theres something bout love
That tears you up
Whoa oh oh oh
You still believe
When the world falls down like the rain
Itll bring you to your knees (to your knees)
Theres something bout love that breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh
But dont give up
Theres something bout love

Whoa oh oh oh..
Sets you free
Theres something bout love
That tears you up
Whoa oh oh oh
You still believe
When the world falls down like the rain---Lyrics submitted by christian.
