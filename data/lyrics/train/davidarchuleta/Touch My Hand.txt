Saw you from the distance
Saw you from the stage
Something bout the look in your eyes
Something bout your beautiful face

In a sea of people
There is only you
I never knew what this song was about
But suddenly now I do

Try to reach out to you touch my hand
Reach out as far as you can
Only me, only you, and the band
Try to reach out to you touch my hand

[Chorus]
Can't let the music stop
Can't let this feeling end
Cause if I do it will all be over
I'll never see you again

Can't let the music stop
Until I touch your hand
Cause if I do it will all be over
I'll never get the chance again
I'll never get the chance again
I'll never get the chance again

I see the sparkle of a million flashlights
I wonder while the stars
But the one shining out so bright
Is the one right where you are

Try to reach out to you touch my hand
Reach out as far as you can
Only me, only you, and the band
Try to reach out to you touch my hand

(Chorus)

Saw you from a distance
Saw you from the stage
Something 'bout the look in your eyes
Something 'bout your beautiful face

(Chorus)

Try to reach out to you touch my hand (I'll never get the chance again)
Reach out as far as you can (I'll never get the chance again)
Only me, only you, and the band
Try to reach out to you touch my hand, ya-a-ya-a-ya!---
