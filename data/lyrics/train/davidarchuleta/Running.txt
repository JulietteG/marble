Words keep fallin' out of my pocket.
Runnin' late, missed the train,
Everything is droppin'.
Holdin' onto my heart,
In I rush out, almost forgot it.
I must admit it, I'm tired,
But I'm comin' to you.
Don't know how far I've gone,
But I don't care.

I'm not gonna stop runnin'.
'Cause without you,
I've got nothin'.
I know you're somewhere runnin'
Straight to me.
Don't stop runnin'.
Don't stop
Keep on runnin',
Don't stop.
Keep on runnin'.

Legs keep givin' out,
Breakin' down; I'm fallin'.
Head keeps tellin' me,
This can't be worth all of this.
Holdin' onto my heart, feel the rush.
I'm ready to run forever.
I'm holdin' it together,
'Cause I'm comin' to you.
I don't know how far I've gone,
But I don't care.

I'm not gonna stop runnin'.
'Cause without you,
I've got nothin'.
I know you're somewhere runnin'
Straight to me.
Don't stop runnin'.
Don't stop

I got my good shoes.
I got my winning, girl, I'm focused
And I'm about to navigate straight to you
And nothing's gonna stop me, girl
To keep me from comin'
'Cause I got to have every part of you forever.

I'm runnin', I'm runnin'.
Keep runnin', I'm runnin'.
Keep runnin', keep runnin'.

I'm not gonna stop runnin'.
'Cause without you,
I've got nothin'.
I know you're somewhere runnin'
Straight to me.
Don't stop runnin'.

I'm not gonna stop runnin'.
'Cause without you,
I've got nothin'.
I know you're somewhere runnin'
Straight to me.
Don't stop runnin'.
Don't stop runnin'. ---Lyrics submitted by Amaryllis.
