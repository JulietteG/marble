"You see that mountain over there? Yeah? 
Well, one of these days I'm gonna climb that mountain". 

Oh, play me some mountain music, 
Like grandma and grandpa used to play. 
Then I'll float on down the river 
To a Cajun hideaway. 

Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with ol' Huck Finn. 
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreamin' again. 

Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man. 
Spend the day bein' lazy, just bein' nature's friend. 
Climb a long tall hick'ry. Bend it over, skinnin' cats. 
Playin' baseball with chert rocks, usin' sawmill slabs for bats. 

Play some back-home, come-on music 
That comes from the heart. 
Play something with lots of feelin', 
'Cause that's where music has to start. 

Oh play me mountain music. 
Oh play me mountain music. 
Oh play me mountain music. 
Oh play me mountain music. ---
