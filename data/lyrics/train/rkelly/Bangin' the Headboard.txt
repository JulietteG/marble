Eh eh eh Oh
Eh oh
Eh Oh
Feel so freaky
I... feel so freaky
(Listen)

There's something bout the way you look at me
And it's got me imagining and seeing things
Like us both in a room in my domain
I'm bout to blow up in here like a hurricane
And I can't take it no more
And you can't fake it no more
Playing hard to get girl
Please leave that thought outside the door
Cos the truth of the matter is that you want me and I want you ah
So let's quit playing around and let's get our ass under these cover

(Oh)
There's so many things I wanna do to you
(Oh)
And there's so many things I want for you
(Oh)
On this night, I'll make sure you won't regret
What you and me did in this bed

(Chorus)
Girl we'll be bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard

(And Oooh)
It feels just like we floating in this room
(Oh oh oh)
And the water can put this fire out in you
And aint no other girl on this earth I choose
Baby but you
And I'm gonna rock that body fast to sleep
(Girl why do you fasten up)
Girl you gonna give that body back to me
(As soon as you wake up)
Starting all over again
Second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth wind
Till the morning comes, I'll be going in
(Yeah)

(Oh)
There's so many things I wanna do to you
(Oh)
And there's so many things I want for you
(Oh)
On this night, I'll make sure you won't regret
What you and me did in this bed

(Chorus)
Girl we'll be bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard

Baby, hold the pillow tight
It's bout to be a wild night
Squeak in the bed, and we're gonna make the walls bang
Squeak in the bed, and baby girl I hope that you can hang
Oooh, Oooh
Those are the sounds that we're making
When we bangin' bangin' bangin'

(Chorus)
Girl we'll be bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
(Bangin' the headboard)
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
(Bangin' the headboard)
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
(We'll be)
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
(Ba ba bangin'the headboard)
We'll be bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
We're gonna wake the neighbors up
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
Cos you're screaming whilst I'm tearin' it up
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
And it don't stop till the mornin' comes
Bangin' bangin' bangin' ba bangin' the headboard
Bangin' hmm, bangin' hmm, bangin' hmmm, bangin'---Lyrics submitted by guillaume.
