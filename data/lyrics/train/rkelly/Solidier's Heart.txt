All hope was gone
Hard to hang on 
Hard to be strong
was blind, could not see
nothing but walls in front of me
and inside no peace

and the mountains seemed
impossible to climb until

you stood on the front lines
you led the way out of the darkness
we didn't go astray
you were ready to die for our sake 
and that takes a soldier's heart

oceans so deep
uphill so steep
but we still believe
and when the road was to far to travel
heroes you came and carried us there

and the mountains seemed
impossible to climb until

you stood on the front lines
you led the way out of the darkness
we didn't go astray
you were ready to die for our sake 
and that takes a soldier's heart

and so our flag was still there
all because you decided to care

you stood on the front lines
you led the way out of the darkness
we didn't go astray
you were ready to die for our sake
and that take's..

you stood on the front lines
you led the way out ot the darkness
you could of let us go astray
you were ready to die for our sake
and that takes a soldier's heart
and that takes a soldier's heart
it take's a soldier's heart---Lyrics submitted by Nicky.
