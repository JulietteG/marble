Chorus:
Girl you make me wanna get ya pregnant, 
Girl you make me wanna get ya pregnant, 
Lay your body down and get you pregnant, 
Knock you UP, pregnant, knock you UP;

Verse 1:
Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man, 
And take her to her hotel for just a one night stand, 
See Im a playa so I aint tryna take her on no dates, 
But much like my patrone man Im just tryna take it straight, 
Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty, 
Sweetest girl in the world to me and I mean it and on top of that shes a cutie, 
I aint seen nothing like her around here in a while, 
And if I had a girl shed be the one to bear my child, 
Telling myself Im a playa so I keep tryna shake it off, 
But I keep seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog, 
Never felt nothing like this, 
Shes more than a mistress enough bout to handle my business, 
Now put that girl in my kitchen; 

Chorus:
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
(Thats what I told her) 
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
Lay your body down and get you pregnant, 
Knock you UP, pregnant, knock you UP; 

Verse 2:
All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me, 
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese, 
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasy, 
I can have you co starring and get in one of my new movies, 
Tell me what your name is, 
I can make you famous, 
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexing, 
Now I aint got nothing to do tonight I gotta wait for my crew, 
I just wanna put some on you, 
And I can tell that you want it too, 
Ready, Ready, 
And Im ready babe, 
And your ready babe, 
So come on ladies let's get out of this club, 
Kells, Dream and Rese after party, 
Come on fuck with us; 

Chrous:
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant,

Verse 3:
This song has got me hungry baby baby, 
So tell me that you want me baby baby, 
And girl I'll love you till the sun shines, 
And girl I promise i will make you mine, 
Around the world in and out of clubs hanging with chicks, 
and I don't see nothing wrong with having a kid, 
oh oh oh
sound like heaven's calling us,
oh oh oh, 
and girl it's about making love,
if you choose me i guarantee the rest of your life will be mad drama free, 
I think both of us should leave this club, and get somewhere alone with me where there's no phone to ring and plant this magic seed;

Chorus:
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant, 
Lay your body down and get you pregnant, 
Knock you UP, pregnant, knock you UP; 

Verse 4:
Your House, my House, don't matter, get it up, 
Your city, my city don't matter, give it up,
Something about being with you makes me wanna a baby ,
Put those pills on chill and girl give me my baby, 
You could play all you want but i know you feel it too, 
For three weeks you've been talking bout extra bedrooms, 
In New York meeting with the realtor,
There's something you wanna tell me just say it i'll ok it, 
Oh girl imma take care of you imma still hold you like we are brand new, 
So don't get it twisted for thirty something weeks i'm still gonna hit it babysit it babysit it;

Verse 5:
Take you out to eat uh uh, 
Wined and dined uh uh, 
Shopping spree uh uh,
Sexing me uh huh, 
See I'm not cheap or selfish babe, 
Girl I'm just thirsty for the booty babe, 
It's all you fault baby you look good, 
It's all your fault that it feels like wood, 
And you look so bored up in this club so let's go, 
We can hop in Lamborghini roll to my big home,
Eh eh eh eh eh, 
Let's go crazy, 
Let's make a, 
Little Kelly, 
Baby i got goodies and i want you to have some, 
All I ask is you let me explore your secret garden; 

Chrous Outro:
