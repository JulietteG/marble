Bright nigh, city lights and a city that never sleeps
Loud music and talks people where all the party sings
I saw a girl and I nodes that she nodes me
 then she told me all about her dreams
And we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memorys like a photograph and I cant get her out of my head

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab X 3

And the  now shes been
I come alone, come  what she said?
I come alone, come  to me

Looking at the rear view she said to me let go and be free
Then she told the driver mind his business and then  me
Then I told her which is 15 minutes from my home
But she didnt stop, she kept saying it feels so incredible wrong

And we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memorys like a photograph oh baby girl, and I cant get her out of my head
Last night we made love in a taxi cab X 3
And the  now shes been


And all have been so soon, girl
I didnt even get a name,  dont  got a room
It was like a hotel room,  people love the best 

And we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memorys like a photograph oh baby girl, photograph baby, and I cant get her out of my head
Last night we made love in a taxi cab X 3
And the  now shes been
The girls meant for me
We made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, X 3
That we made love in a taxi cab, reminded me of a dream I had
Now the memorys like a photograph, and I cant get her out of my head.---Lyrics submitted by keko.
