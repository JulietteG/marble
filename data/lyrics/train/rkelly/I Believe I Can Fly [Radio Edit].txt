I uesd to think, that i could not go on
And life was nothing, but an awful song

But i know the meaning of true love
Im leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it that i can do it
if i just belive it theres nothing to it

(chorus)
i belive i can fly 
i belive i can touch the sky
i think about it ever night and day,
i spread my wings and fly away
i belive i can soar
i see me runnin through that open door
i belive i can fly
i belive i can fly
i belive i can fly

See, i was on the verge of breaking down
sometimes silence can seem so loud

There are miracles i must achieve
But first i know it starts in me

Could i belive in it?
if i can see it than i can do it
if i just belive it theres nothing to it

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by right.
