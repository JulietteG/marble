1...  2...  3...  4...

Whistling (long)....

Bumble bees and growing trees
blowing through that Summer breeze
fire flies on Autum nights
jack-o-lanters burning bright!

These are the things, we see, each year
that show we grow,  oh it's time, to cheer 
Seasons of the year!

whistling (long)....

Windy roar of the snowy storm
bundled up to keep you worm
Spring birds all sing that tune
Singing for the month of June

These are the things, we see, each year
that show we grow,  oh it's time, to cheer 
Seasons of the year

Lulla by 
Look at my eyes
Its time to take good care
Lulla by  
I want to stay for a while
Oh, its time to take good care
Care

whistling (long)....

Bumble Bees
whistling (short)....
Growing Trees
whistling (short)....
Fire flies
whistling (short)....
Autum Nights
whistling (short)...

these are the things, we see, each year
that show we've grown...

these are the things, we see, each year
that show we've grown...
these are the things, we see, each year
that show we grow,  oh it's time, to cheer 
Seasons of the year!
