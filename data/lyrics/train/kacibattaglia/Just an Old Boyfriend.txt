i see you on the street my broken heart still skips a beat i hear your name inside i go insane baby each day that we dont touch its one more day it hurts too much i cant forget the love that we made but 

(chorus) 
there will come a moment that we're gonna meet (again) baby it wont even bother me gonna make it till the day you'll be just an old boyfriend  wont be thinking of you every night, wont be wishing we could only try, wont tear me up inside just an old boyfriend 

anyone can see the love we killed is killing me im just so sad to loose what we had (oh ya) and there's no doubt that i should be okay by now but im not there yet it hurts me so bad but,

(chorus)

nothing more and nothing less no more living with regrets my memory wont get the best of me (wont get the best of me, oh your gonna see)

(chorus x2)---
