I think Im crazy I think Im going out of my mind 
Call me crazy I thought I saw you touching my guy 
Are you crazy maybe I should take you outside and show you crazy 
Ooh I got your crazy 

A little hazy maybe Im just losing my mind 
I think your shady I know that youve been calling my guy 
Are you crazy now Im gonna take you outside and show you crazy 
Ooh I got you crazy 

CH: 
Call my man again and Im a **** you up and Im a **** you up and Im **** you up 
Touch my man again and Im a **** you up and Im a **** you up 
And then you call me your best friend 
And then you call me your best friend 

Verse 2: 
Call me crazy but every time that I turn around 
Youre on my baby ooh but Im his lady 
Am I possessive just because Im claiming whats mine 
Youre crossing the line 

Why are you constantly calling him up 
To pick you up 
Let me know now 
How can you call me your best friend 
Then turn around secretly text him 
You call me crazy 
Ooh I got your crazy 

CH: 
Call my man again and Im a **** you up and Im a **** you up and Im **** you up 
Touch my man again and Im a **** you up and Im a **** you up 
Call my man again and Im a **** you up and Im a **** you up and Im **** you up 
Touch my man again and Im a **** you up and Im a **** you up 
And then you call me your best frie nd 
And then you call me your best friend 

Bridge: 
They call me crazy they say Im crazy 
(I know you are but what am I? I know you are but what am I?) 
They call me crazy I think Im crazy 
(I know you are but what am I? I know you are but what am I?) 
Ooh I got your crazy!---Lyrics submitted by kirkwood.
