Feeling like a loser 
Feeling like a bum 
Sitting on the outside 
Observing the fun
Don't get on my bad side 
I can work a gun 
Hop into the backseat baby 
I'll show you some fun

These people are weird in here 
And they're giving me the fear 
Just because you know my name 
Doesn't mean you know my game
I look myself in the face 
And whisper "I'm in the wrong place" 
Is there more to lose than gain 
If I go on my own again? (On my own again)

Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside...

People are connecting 
Don't know what to say 
I'm good at protecting 
What they want to take
Spilt the milk at breakfast 
Hit me double hard 
And I grinned at you softly 
Because I'm a fucking wild card

These people are weird in here 
And they're giving me the fear 
Just because you know my name 
Doesn't mean you know my game
I look myself in the face 
And whisper "I'm in the wrong place" 
Is there more to lose than gain 
If I go on my own again? (On my own again)

Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside...

All I know is I cannot pretend 
So I'm sitting on the outside again

On my own again 
Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside (again)

On my own again 
Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside the outsider (on my own again) 
Inside the outsider (on my own again)
Inside (again)
Inside (again)
Inside (again)
Inside (again)
Inside (again)
Inside (again)---Lyrics submitted by John Smith.
