Ive seen seasons come and go
From winter sun to summer snow
This aint my first time at the rodeo

Nature aint a fruit machine
Shes gotta keep her credits clean
Good things come to those who wait
But I aint in a patient phase

Its summer time and I hang on a vine
Theyre gonna make me into sweet red wine
Hanging around like a fruit on a tree
Waiting to be picked, come on cut me free

Come on fill your cup up
Looking for some good luck
Good luck, good luck to you
Hanging like a fruit
Ready to be juiced
Juiced, juiced

Living La Dolce Vita
Life couldnt get much sweeter
Dont you give me a reason
That its not the right season
Babe, I love you a lot
Ill give you all Ive got
Yeah, you know that its true
Ive been saving all my summers for you
Ive been saving all my summers for you
Like Froot, Like Froot

Baby, I am plump and ripe
Im pinker than shepherds delight
Sweet like honeysuckle late at night

Leave it too long Ill go rot
Like an apple you forgot
Birds and worms will come for me
The cycle of life is complete

Im your carnal flower, Im your bloody rose
Pick my petals off and make my heart explode
Im your deadly nightshade, Im your cherry tree
Youre my one true love, Im your destiny

Come on fill your cup up
Looking for some good luck
Good luck, good luck to you
Autumn, Ill be gone
Birds will sing their mourning song
Song

Living La Dolce Vita
Life couldnt get much sweeter
Dont you give me a reason
That its not the right season
Babe, I love you a lot
Ill give you all Ive got
Yeah you know that its true
Ive been saving all my summers for you
Ive been saving all my summers for you
Like Froot, Like Froot

Oh my body is ready
Yeah its ready, yeah its ready for your love
Oh my branches are heavy
Yeah theyre heavy, yeah theyre heavy

Living La Dolce Vita
Life couldnt get much sweeter
Dont you give me a reason
That its not the right season
Babe, I love you a lot
Ill give you all Ive got
Yeah you know that its true
Ive been saving all my summers for you
Ive been saving all my summers for you
Like Froot, Like Froot

Living La Dolce Vita
Im in love
Living La Dolce Vita
Im in love
Im in love---
