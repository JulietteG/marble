Ne Hao Ma is what you say when you get on the Chinatown Bus
Ne Hao Ma is what you say when you get on the Chinatown Bus

When you say, Ne hao ma they will look at you and smile Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
They will think you know Chinese but you will only know Ne hao ma ah ha ha ha ha ha
They will like you more than all the white people next to you oh oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They will know you better than just another passenger
You will be happy that all you had to remember was

Ne Hao Ma is what you say when you get on the Chinatown Bus
Ne Hao Ma is what you say when you get on the Chinatown Bus

When you only have ten dollars you can go so fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa far
It is almost as enjoyable as driving in you ca ca ca ca ca ca ca ca car
When you stop at Wendys you can get some French fr fr fr fr fr fr French Fries
You can smoke cigarettes with the driver and you can watch him dr dr dr dr dr dr dr drive
And he will know you better than just another passenger
You will be happy that all you had to remember was

Ne Hao Ma is what you say when you get on the Chinatown Bus
Ne Hao Ma is what you say when you get on the Chinatown Bus
Ne Hao Ma is what you say when you get on the Chinatown Bus
Ne Hao Ma is what you say when you get on the Chinatown Bus

Ooh, going uptown, going downtown, going to Beantown
Ooh, down to Washingon D.C.
Going crosstown, up to Beantown
Oh yeah, down to Washington D.C!

Ne Hao Ma is what you say when you get on the Chinatown Bus
