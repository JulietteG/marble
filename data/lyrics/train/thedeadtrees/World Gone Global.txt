Laying down by the river
Watching you die

Look at the moon, look at the sun, 
Baby one at a time

Its been especially a good one. 
Is that your favorite line?

How did the world become your ashtray? 
Dont forget the implied.

Nope.

Dirty, mean, and lazy
You thought that I was someone you could abuse

Didnt think I had no feelings
Well I do
Somewhere

Eager beaver rollers all singing their song
Hear them on the way to Pamona as the whimper along

How come no one ever wants to stand still 
When theres shit going on?

Be free, grow up, stay young - What are you putting me on?
Well,

Dirty, mean and lazy,
You thought that I was someone you could abuse.

Didnt think I had no feelings
Well, I do
Somewhere

In the land unknown (x4)---Lyrics submitted by isra sharnez.
