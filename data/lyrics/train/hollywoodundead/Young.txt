We are young! 
But we have heart! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong! 
But we don't belong! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 

I see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain. 
I see the love; I see the hate; I see this world that we can make! 
I see life I see the sky. Give it all to see you fly... 
Yes! we wave this flag of hatred, but you're the ones who made it!! 
Watch the beauty of all our lies passing right before my eyes. 
I hear the hate in all your words all the wars to make us hurt 
We get so sick of so sick; we never wanted all this 
Medication for the kids with no reason to live! 

So we 
March to the drums of the dammed as we come 
Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb! 

We are young! 
But we have heart! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong! 
But we don't belong! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 

As we walk among the shadows the streets the field of battle 
Take it up, we wear the medal, raise your hands with burning candles. 
Hear us whisper in the dark hear in the rain u see the spark 
Feel the beating of our heart fleeting hope as we depart 
All together, walk alone against all we've ever known 
All we've ever really wanted was a place to call our home 
But you take all we are; the innocence of our hearts. 
Make us kneel before the alter as you tear us apart! 

So we 
March to the drums of the dammed as we come 
Watch it burn in the sun - we are numb! 

We are young! 
But we have heart! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong! 
But we don't belong! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 

We will fight or we will fall 
till the angels sing our song 

We will fight or we will fall 
till the angels sing our song 

We will fight or we will fall 
till the angels sing our song... 

We are young! 
But we have heart! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong! 
But we don't belong! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 

We are young! 
But we have heart! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart 
We are strong! 
But we don't belong! 
Born in this world as it all falls apart---Lyrics submitted by DoMonique.
