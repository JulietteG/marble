(Lets watch it burn) [X2]
Lets watch this city burn the world 

Lets watch this city burn 
From the skylines on top of the world 
Till theres nothing left of her 
Lets watch this city burn the world 

My body doused 
With two empty cans of gas 
The only evidence they have 
Is a police sketch of my mask 
And its hard at times to ask 
If you can save my heart for last 

And its hard to face the facts 
When the darkness fades to black 
Its not just make believe 
When they make me take a seat 
And they put amphetimines 
in the air and make me breathe 

So come on and grab your children 
Look out for burning buildings 
And villains who pillage
They're killin' by the millions
And billions of people die 
For a lost cause 
So now I pray to my nation 
thats destroyed under god 

(Say its the end of the world) 
All my battles have been won 
But the war has just begun 

Lets watch this city burn 
From the skylines on top of the world 
Till theres nothing left of her 
Lets watch the city burn the world 

The city is so pretty 
You wanna burn it with me 
Till the sky bleeds ashes 
And the f**kin sky crashes 

They catch us with the matches 
And ignite the flame
And all the hopes of a youth 
Deemed fuckin' insane

They say
Take the pill, in God we trust
Go and kill, God loves us
As in life, as in death
Breathing til there is no breath

I will not die in the night 
But in the light of the sun 
With the ashes of this world in my lungs 

But who am I to say 
Lets all just run away 
Grab your saints and pray 
And we're gonna burn this world today

(It's the end of the world)
As in Heaven, as in Earth, we`ve been done since our birth

Lets watch this city burn 
From the skylines on top of the world 
Till theres nothing left in her 
Lets watch the city burn the world 

(Lets watch it burn) [X2]
The city looks so pretty 
do you wanna burn it with me 
The city looks so pretty 
do you wanna burn it with me 
The city looks so pretty 
do you wanna burn it with me
The city looks so pretty 
do you wanna burn it with me 

We use the trees as tourches 
Do you wanna burn it with me 
Fill the streets with corpses 
Do you wanna burn it with me 
watch the city fuckin bleed 
Do you wanna burn it with me 
Bring the world to its knees 
Do you wanna burn it with me 

Lets watch this city burn 
From the skylines on top of the world 
Till theres nothing left of her 
Lets watch this city burn the world 
Lets watch this city burn 
From the skylines on top of the world 
Till theres nothing left of her 
Lets watch this city burn the world 

Lets watch it burn 
Lets watch it burn 
Lets watch this city burn the world---Lyrics submitted by DoMonique.
