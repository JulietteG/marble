[Funny Man:]
Funny Man, call me Randy Savage
Say oh yeah I could do some damage
I play the field like a west coast captain
White CKs you know that Im saggin
Get down cause the moon is out
Im Undead thats without a doubt
See me transform, whats that all about?
I'm a freak with some fangs get some pussy now
Dr. Feelgood expedition
Check my brand, its called Funny Delicious
Rub my lamp while I grant your wishes
Hood magic for all yall bitches

[Chorus (Danny):]
This is how we rock it for the ages
We make you fucking famous
I thought I told you its about to go down
This is how we rock it for the ages
You wonder how we made it
I thought I told you its about to go down

[Funny Man:]
Piece on my lap with the pistol grip
Slip back to the cut no need to trip
Rip back the bong so I can take a hit
Yeah ease my mind I need to get lit
You know Im one of a kind
The rims I roll are supersized
Oh Big Macs without the fries
I need a shake girl roll inside
Too worthless get you rockin
Once we roll there aint no stoppin
Im so high like Mary Poppins
Supercalifragic - yo suck my dick

[Chorus (Danny):]
This is how we rock it for the ages
We make you fucking famous
I thought I told you its about to go down
This is how we rock it for the ages
You wonder how we made it
I thought I told you its about to go down
(Come on, come on, its about to go)

[Funny Man:]
From the top and the bottom, the bottom to the top
Its all good if the party dont stop
From the top and the bottom, the bottom to the top
All yall bitches better take another shot

[Danny:]
We keep it on the broken key
Put your hands up now
Light it up and smoke them trees
Blow it out with the crowd
We keep it on them broken key
So put your hands up now
Light it up and smoke them trees
Cause its about to go down

[Funny Man:]
Its about to go down

[Chorus (Danny):]
This is how we rock it for the ages
We make you fucking famous
I thought I told you its about to go down
This is how we rock it for the ages
You wonder how we made it
I thought I told you its about to go down

[Danny:]
This is how we rock it, ro-ro-ro-ro-rock it
Its about to go down
This is how we rock it, ro-ro-ro-ro-rock it
Its about to go down
