Tear it up, tear it up yeah
Tear it up, tear it up yeah
Tear it up, tear it up yeah
Here we go now, here we go

So dont make me tear it up,
You know I dont give a fuck,
And I aint here to shake things up,
But I got my hand on my gun.
So dont make me tear it up,
You know I dont give a fuck,
And I aint here to shake things up,
But I got my hand on my gun.

I beat the pussy up like Ying-Yang,
Put it right, thur like Ching-Chang
You know I make her shit like bang
You know I dont give a mother-fuck,
About your first name
I wanna lock that ass like a
Mother-fucking chain-gang.
Tear it up, stand up and throw it up,
And tear up the floor like you dont give a fuck
I know you got heels on
I know what yall feal on
They caught us ridin dirtier
Than their bumpin Camillion
I got a bounty on my head
Just for reppin Undead
Because im freakin on your sister
And Im grindin her friend
And, what the fuck you think?
Im tryin to make em sweat
Like a mother fuckin track meet
J-D-O-G, I got your girl on a leash
I got her feenin and the whole crowds screamin
Shake it like a what?
Fuck you!
HU crew.
We dont give a fuck!
What? What?

So dont make me tear it up,
You know I dont give a fuck,
And I aint here to shake things up,
But I got my hand on my gun.
Shake it like a what?
Fuck you!
Shake it like a what?
Fuck you!
Shake it like a what?
Fuck you!
Shake it like a what?
Fuck you!

No I aint gansta, 
Dont pack a pistol,
Mother-fuckers keep runnin out
Mother-fucker catch a fistful,
Guided like a missile from
Two bottles of Jacks
That I drank in the back
Of an 88 Cadillac
Its Johnny Three  
Johnny sees what Johnny needs
Johnny breaths weed
Still, Johnny dont see anything
Johnny buys drink
Johnny winks and Johnny thinks
Johnny circles dance floor like roller rink
Jump up down down
In the H-town get down
To the sound thats bound
To make the mother-fucking crowd loud
Wanna see you move, 
Yeah move to the music
Wanna see you booze
Yeah booze til you puke it
See bitch, grab ass
Get smacked to the mat (bitch)
Slap back, get thrown out the back
Watch your back through the back door
Back to the dance floor
Gotta gotta get my,
Gotta gotta get more

So dont make me tear it up,
You know I dont give a fuck,
And I aint here to shake things up,
But I got my hand on my gun.
So dont make me tear it up,
You know I dont give a fuck,
And I aint here to shake things up,
But I got my hand on my gun.

Hell yeah mother-fucker!
Turn it up!
Turn it up, focus 3
Fuck you Jeff Peters!
Fuck you Mike Reneau!
Gangstas up in this bitch
You gotta write it down
Fuck yeah!---Lyrics submitted by brooke.
