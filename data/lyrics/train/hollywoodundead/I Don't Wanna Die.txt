I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

Blood is getter hotter
Body's getting colder
I've told you once
I'm the only one who holds her.

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

I look inside of myself, and try to find someone else
Someone who's willing to die, Instead of watching you cry for help
I know that blood will be spilled, and if you wont - then I will
My grave will never be filled, It's either kill or be killed
So let heaven be told, that some may come some may go
where I'll end up, I don't know. But I ain't dying alone
I keep on asking the question, ''Can I be saved by confession?''
You see this blood on my hands at least they're still reaching their heaven
I got to pick up the pieces, I got to bury them deep 
And when you look in my eyes i'll be the last thing you see.

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

Blood is getting hotter
Body's getting colder
I've told you once
I'm the only one who holds her.

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

Hurt turned into blood, and the blood keeps on pouring
From every pour I wipe it up, this is just to be demoted
Now someone started dying, I'm my only opponent? 
'Cause I will watch my baby cry, so I'll keep on just going
Am I a man or a beast, it's mother nature at least
watch humanity cease, `cause it's our human disease
You got to kill when you gotta kill, yeah that's what they say
And I can go against God's will, you better pray
'Cause I'm an angel, a demon
Yeah I'm hell and I'm heaven. I'm everything you couldn't be
Now you believe in the devil.
I got to pick up the pieces, I got to bury them deep 
And when the dirt hits the coffin - just go to sleep.

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

Blood is getter hotter
Body's getting colder
I've told you once
I'm the only one who holds her
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die.

Now that I see, I see you buried...six feet below.

Another life, goes into the night
I couldn't let him breathe, 'cause I didn't wanna die...

Now that I see, I see You buried...six feet below.

It's not alright... can't you hear me as I cry? 
I couldn't let you live, 'cause I didn't wanna die.

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die
So you're gonna have to.

I Don't wanna die!---Lyrics submitted by Keaton.
