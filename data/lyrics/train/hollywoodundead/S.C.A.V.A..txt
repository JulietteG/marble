When the end is getting closer,
and the earth has burned the sky,
now repent cus it's all over
just let me die!

Heres the massacre,
a masoleum fit for me
Lived a hundred years,
a hundred years i didnt see...
gave all my hope away
isnt any left for me??
Bombs are splittinatoms,
what can the future brings...
We can fill a million choirs,
and wait till children sing...
we can walk a million miles
and end up in the sea
And our lungs just keep filling...
and lying when we breathe
the world is filled with liars... liars like me
and i look at my child,
it's fine like this feeling,
eyes blue like the sky,
i see all of this meaning
i reach up to God,
and i ask if i am dreaming
so sorry i dont have those things that youre needing
darling a kiss
KISS ME IM LEAVING!!!

When the end is getting closer,
and the earth has burned the sky,
now repent cuz its all over
just let me die

As my body lies here broken,
and Im carried to the light,
now my heart is finally open
just let me die


Everybody says.. greetings and goodbyes...
everybody pays, no one knows the price...
We know the price of sin,
the sin of sacriface!
I know ill sin again,
but who can save me twice??!
How much can we ask...
You get the answer first...
How much can we kneel
with the air that chills the earth
The air keeps getting colder
my knees keep hittindirt
the innocent can cry
without the guilty getting hurt
You ask who you love, and you dont know
No? Do you?
The spirit of the God
just passes right through you
you gave away haven
Handed right to you and i can see it all
tell me - is it true?
Kiss me my darling...
DARLING I NEED YOU!!!

where do we go?
we go... oh
Lord i dont know where we go
we go... NO!!!
I DO!!!

where do we go?
we go... oh
Lord i dont know where we go
we go... NO!!!
I DO!!!

LORD I DONT KNOW!!

When the end is getting closer,
and the earth has burned the sky,
now repent cuz its all over
just let me die

As my body lies here broken,
and Im carried to the light,
now my heart is finally open
just let me die---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
