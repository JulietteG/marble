Cause I
I think of you now and then
The memories never end
When gravity pulls you in

You in...

I remember looking back
Converse and a starter cap
Now I'm sitting wishing that
Wishing I could just go back
I was happy with no fame
Faultiest at switching lanes
Buying 40s with some change
The Southern California days

I watch you pass me by
My words they can't describe
But I can see the gravity
Way up from the sky
We leave the past behind
Cause we all want to fight
Deep down in life you can't deny
We're all the same inside

Cause I
I think of you now and then
The memories never end
When gravity pulls you in

Cause I
I think of you now and then
Well never be there again
When gravity pulls you in

Oh gravity...

I remember looking back
Walking 'round
Sagging khaks
Dime sacks
Alley cats
Burned out
Always slack
Now I got a
Platinum plaque
And life seems to stay the same
Knowin' that I'll never change
Southern California days

Gravity can't stop
The hope and the have-nots
This artery's a part of me
And blood is all Im gonna be
I'm gonna see concrete
Bottles and bad dreams
I'm everything and anything
A memory that never leaves

Deep in the black
Is the place I call home
Taking me back
To The place i belong
Deep in the black
I can find my way home
Please take me back to the place I belong---
