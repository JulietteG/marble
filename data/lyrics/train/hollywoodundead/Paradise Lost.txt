So watch my chest heave 
as this last breath leaves me 
i am trying to be 
what you're dying to see 
i feel like fuck man, 
cant take this, anymore, this heart, break this 
this life thats so thankless 
how could he just forsake us 
breaks us he makes 
hate us he gave us 
nothing but no trust 
and i am so fucked up 
so let this gun bond us 
lets die by this lust 
and once we are just dust 
he'll know that he loved us 

(chorus) 
let it all burn 
i will burn first 
god ive tried,am i lost in your eyes? 

just let me burn 
its what i deserve 
god ive lied,am i lost in your eyes? 

so take me and make me 
weakened and save me 
this hate that you gave me 
keeps saying the same thing 
to sing when you hurt 
and to sing when you cry 
to sing when you live 
and to sing when you die 
and here at the end 
at the end of hurt 
all the pain aint the same 
when its your turn to burn 
we're the hearts for the heartless 
the thoughts for the thoughtless 
the lies for the honest
we're the gods of the godless 

(chorus) 

so cry 3 tears for me 
when its all gone sing me this song 
so cry 3 tears for me 
when its all gone,when its all gone 

i cannot stand who i am 
im this man 
with this blood on my hands 
in this blood i am damned 
so watch my wings burn 
as they burn in the fire 
don't scatter the ashes 
no need for the choir 

(chorus) 

this hate that you gave me keeps saying 
just let me burn,just let me burn 
this hate that you gave me keeps saying 
just let me burn,just let me burn 

burn........no
just let me burn no
burn........burn---Lyrics submitted by Braun.
