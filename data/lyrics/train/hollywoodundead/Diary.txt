Chorus:
'Cause I don't wanna be like this.
I've been runnin these streets for too long now.
I've got nothing thats true, but this song now.
But the further I go, I wanna go home.

Verse: 1
I fuckin' swear that I care, 
but its hard when you stare 
into the bottom of a bottle 
that is empty and bare.

All my desolate soul, 
in my desolate home, 
it's my desolate role, 
yeah, I'm here all alone.

I can't think of a reason 
to get the fuck out of bed, 
Curtains closed, lights are off,
am I alive or dead? 

I haven't shaved in a week, 
I always slur when I speak, 
tolerance at its peak, 
another fit just to sleep.

Oh, woe is me, woe is me, 
I guess I need love. 
Hoes ya see, hoes ya see, 
I'm just in a rut.

And I swear I'm tryin' baby 
please, baby don't leave. 
God-damn, I'm a fuck-up,
but I guess that's just me. 

So I sit in my room 
and I'll cry in my bed, 
thinkin' about all the shit 
that made me wrong in my head.

I keep tryin' to climb, 
but it seems so steep. 
Pour myself a fuckin' whisky 
and go back to sleep... bitch.

[Chorus] 2x

Verse: 2
I watch my momma cry,
she says "baby why?"
I say "baby died, 
baby's gone like a suicide."

I don't think you'll see him soon, Mom,
stay out my room, Mom.
Tell Daddy that I hate 
that mother fucker like you, Mom.

I sing this shit for you, 
Danny, Sasha and Jordan.
These tears keep gettin' warmer 
everytime that I hold her.

I pour this out for you 
like a partner in crime.
Its part of the times 
when you're sick in the mind. 

Yeah I'm sick, oh so sick, 
I'm so sick of this shit. 
Yeah I'm lit, oh so lit, 
I'm so fucked up off it. 

So I stumble around, 
till I stumble, fall down, 
to this puddle of my tears, 
layin' here on the ground.

When you've got nothing left, 
you've got nothing left to lose. 
With my last left single breath 
I'll still be singing to you.

So when you bury me man, 
you better bury me deep 
and sing along to this song 
because you're broken like me.

[Chorus] 2x

[Bridge]
And I wanna go back to the start,
back where we started from. 
And I know it's been so long, 
I was wrong, I was wrong 
I was wrong all along
