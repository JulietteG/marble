its a hard road leads to spirit hollow 
its the last best kiss of winter 
this bitter breeze that blows 
and even though he knows that she will never follow 
its the changin of the year / that sets his mind to go 

so he makes his way from aspen over natchez 
and he sends his love a letter 
but no answer ever comes 
and so he listens for a whisper in the branches 
and the rustlin of the needles / in the noonday sun 

CHORUS: 
and the light when it shines / through the proud dixie pines 
paints her face in the flash and the shadow 
and he stares down the wind / till hes waltzin once again 
with the gypsy Girl From Golden, Colorado 

it was in the holy season of the harvest 
that he found her in the meadow 
overlooking boulder bridge 
she was weavin lady slippers into garlands 
singin bringin in the sheaves / along the chloe ridge 

CHORUS: 
now the light when it shines / through the proud dixie pines 
paints her face in the flash and the shadow 
and he stares down the wind / till hes waltzin once again 
with the gypsy Girl From Golden, Colorado 

INSTRUMENTAL VERSE 

the hinges on the northern gate need mendin 
sheep have gone to pasture, but the grass has burned to brown 
and still this cinder summer shows no sign of endin 
the days turn like molasses / nothin makes a sound 

CHORUS: 
but the light when it shines / through the proud dixie pines 
paints her face in the flash and the shadow 
and he stares down the wind / till hes waltzin once again 
with the gypsy Girl From Golden, Colorado---Lyrics submitted by robyn lydick.
