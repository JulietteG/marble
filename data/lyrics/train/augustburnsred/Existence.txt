This hollow feeling
The knowledge that you exist amidst your insecurities.
Cover up only to coward out
And never shutting up only to never speak aloud.

Have you dried up entirely?
The walls of a church dont make it holy
Its whats authentic that completes the sum of its parts

Dont excuse yourself from life today on the pretense of your past

Youre hurt
Youre broken
Thats alright
This might be what it takes to wake you up
This might be what it takes to wake you up

Are you at your wits end yet?
Are you at your wits end yet?
Are you at your wits end ?
Are you at your wits end yet?

The walls of a church dont make it holy
Security isnt glitzy or glamorous, concrete or cohesive
Therin lies the truth
Lift your head up high

Its what we know we arent, that makes us who we are
Its what we know we arent, that makes us who we are

Youre hurt. Youre broken. Thats alright
That makes us who we are
Youre hurt. Youre broken. Thats alright
That makes us who we are---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
