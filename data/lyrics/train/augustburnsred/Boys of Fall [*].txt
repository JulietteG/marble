Reborn...

Where do we go to escape the end of the world?
Did we, the dogs, open fire that you would cast this rainstorm over above our heads?
This crushing loss that brings us to our knees.

Is there a way to live again when theres nowhere to run?
Is there a way to live again when theres no way to go on?
Is there a way to live again when theres nowhere to run?
Is there a way to live again through this dark tragedy?

He is God. We are just men. Who are we to question?
He is God. We are just men. Who are we to question?
He is God. He is God.

Were figures in a forest full of haunting trees,
brushing shoulders with death to make sure were alive.
With the whole world ahead, and our hearts left behind.

Every word burns, branding broken souls.
Pushing to move on. Soon we will be home.

When youve lost your way, when you have no words,
we are your strength, when you dont have anymore. (Oh...)
We are your strength. We are your strength.

Oh Sunday mourning, all we had we lost. All we gained is chaos.
Where we belong is with You. All we have is You. Where we belong is with You.
All we have is You. Where we belong is with You. Please rescue us.

A star cant be seen unless all the sky decides to be dark. (decides to be dark)
Every drop of a waterfall rushes on towards the end.

This melody will move us. This song will lead us on. Reverence is revival. This town is reborn.
This melody will move us. This song will lead us on. Reverence is revival. This town is reborn.---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
