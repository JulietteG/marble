There is no hope for me, at least I know
I know what I believe, and now I see
No longer will we be fooled, you say
There is no hope for me, at least I know
I know what I believe, and now I see
No longer will we be fooled

White skin, white teeth, black heart, black lungs
Sleeping on your stacks of millions
As your followers struggle to overcome, overcome
Sickness, poverty, heartbreak, hatred are dealt with every day
You can't relate
You can't remember a single name
Stare into a screen before you'll look them in the eyes
You'll never change a life until you know
Everything you say sounds like a lie
Blessed by the hands of God, or cursed by the tongue of the devil?
Who do you serve?

No more ignorance, no more complacency
Behind your white skin and white teeth
Lies a heart so black it makes the abyss look bright
You say, you say, there is no hope for me

If a rich man can't get into heaven, where will you dwell?
If a rich man can't ascend, will I see you in hell?
You say, there is no hope for me, at least I know
I know what I believe, and now I see
No longer will we be fooled, you say
There is no hope for me, at least I know
I know what I believe, and now I see
No longer will we be fooled---
