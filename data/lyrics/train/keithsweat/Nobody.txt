I want to tease you 
I want to please you 
I want to show you baby 
That I need you 

I want your body 
'Till the very last drop 
I want you to holler 
When you want me to stop 

And who can love you like me (nobody) 
Who can sex you like me (nobody) 
Who can treat you like me now, baby (nobody) 
Nobody, baby (nobody) 
And who can do it like me (nobody) 
And who can give you what you need (nobody) 
Who can do you all night long (nobody) 
Nobody, baby (nobody) 

I want the night 
For me and you 
So come here baby 
And let me do it to you 

Don't be afraid 
'Cuz I won't bite 
I promise to give it to you 
Just the way you like 

And who can love you like me (nobody) 
Who can sex you like me (nobody) 
Who can lay your body down (nobody) 
Nobody, baby (nobody) 
And who can treat you like me (nobody) 
Who can give you what you need (nobody) 
And who can do you all night long (nobody) 
Nobody, baby (nobody) 
And the band keeps playing on 

On, on, on, and on, on 
On, on, on, and on, on 
On, on, on, and on, on 
Nobody, baby 
On, on, on, and on, on 
On, on, on, and on, on 
On, on, on, and on, on 
Nobody baby 

I want you right now for my lover 
Oh yes I do 
Place no one above you 
Oh yes I do 
If you need love 
I'll be right 
I'll be right there, baby 
Oh yes I will 
Oh yes I will baby 
Oh yes I will baby 

And who will love you like me (nobody) 
Who can sex your body like me baby (nobody) 
Who can do it like me, baby (nobody) 
No, no, no (nobody) 
Who can lay you down just like me (nobody) 
Who can kiss you all over your body, baby (nobody)---
