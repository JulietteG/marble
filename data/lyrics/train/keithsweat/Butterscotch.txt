Hooo yeah, hooo yeah 
You know we had to do again right? huh huh 
Yeah 
Hooo yeah, hooo yeah 
Now just incase you forgot, 
It went on something like .. this 
On and on and on and on 
That`s right 
Ooooohhh It`s me again 

I remember the very first time that I met you 
Couldn`t take these eyes off you 
There was so much I wanted to do with u babe 

Ooh yeah, yeah yeah babe 
Made a vow that I`d always be here 
No matter what 
Just the two of us 
I am so sprung on you 
I don`t know what to do 
I am so in love with you 
Let me hear those sound yeah 

Do you like the way it sounds when I put it down 
When I make the noise like I do 
Ooh ooh ooh Aw aw awe 

(Your body) My body tastes like butterscotch 
When u lick the spot, U lick up and down 
Ooh ooh ooh 
You qualify, let`s do what freaks do 

Boy I like it when u get on top 
Boy just take your time 
Boy you know u blowing my mind 
Ah ah ah ya 
Boy you know it`s just ain`t no sexual thing 
The way I feel for you is real boy 
Don`t question me 

Your fantasies I will fulfill boy 
You should be loving me 
Aaaaah 

Do you like the way it sounds 
When I put it down 
When I make the noise like I do 
Ooh oooh oooh aw aw aw 
I like the way you scream my name 
My body tastes like butterscotch 
When you hit the spot you will be looking up and down 
You qualify, let do what freaks do 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 

I won`t stop till I, hit the spot till I 
I won`t stop till I, make you hot till i 
I won`t stop till I, make you cream till I 
I won`t stop till I, you know what I mean 
I won`t stop till I, hear you moan girl i 
I won`t stop till I, hear you groan yeah 
I won`t stop till I, come on top of me 
I won`t stop till you tell me you can`t take no more 

Do you like the way it sounds 
When I put it down 
When I make the noise like I do 
Ooh oooh Aah aah aah 
My body tastes like butterscotch 
When you hit the spot you will be looking up and down 
You qualify, let do what freaks do 

Boy I like the way us do what we do 
Girl don`t you know I am love with you 
Boy I like the way you make me feel they way I feel 
Girl don`t know my love for you is real 
Boy I like the way you make me scream my name 
Girl I can`t lie you just drive me insane
