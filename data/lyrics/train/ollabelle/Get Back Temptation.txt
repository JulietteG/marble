Well you washed them all away
Let them drift on your tide
At the end of that day
Carry me over to the other side
Carry me over to the other side

Through the valley I had walked
For a thousand thousand days
If the Lord and I hadnt talked
Could have never found my way
Could have never found my way

Well, NOW
GET BACK TEMPTATION
I wont follow you no more
GET BACK TEMPTATION
I have my eye on Heavens Door
GET BACK TEMPTATION
Soon Salvation will be mine
GET BACK TEMPTATION
I have seen the seven signs
I have seen the seven signs

I have seen the face of a hooker
I have heard the voice of pain
I have felt the touch of the devil
Ive had jealousy in my veins
Ive had jealousy in my veins

Well, NOW
GET BACK TEMPTATION
I wont follow you no more
GET BACK TEMPTATION
I have my eye on Heavens Door
GET BACK TEMPTATION
Soon Salvation will be mine
GET BACK TEMPTATION
I have seen the seven signs
I have seen the seven signs---Lyrics submitted by David.
