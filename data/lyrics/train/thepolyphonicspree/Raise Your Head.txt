Raise your head
To the sky
You'll be free
When you try
Raise your head
To the sky
You'll be free
When you try
Raise your head
To the sky
You'll be free
When you try
And look for your wellness
It's not so dangerous
All this commotion makes you look high
Go back to the way you laugh
Zip up your Superman
Somehow your reach is in flight
Raise your head
To the sky
You'll be free
When you try
Raise your head
To the sky
You'll be free
When you try
Look for your wellness
It's not so dangerous
All this commotion makes you look high
Go back to the way you laugh
Zip up your Superman
Somehow your reach is in flight
Raise your head
To the sky
You'll be free
When you try
Raise your head
To the sky
You'll be free
When you try
Raise your head
To the sky
You'll be free
When you try
Raise your head
To the sky
You'll be free
When you try
(You'll be free)---Lyrics submitted by Paul Mabbitt.
