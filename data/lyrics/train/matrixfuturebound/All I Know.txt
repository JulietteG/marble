(feat. Luke Bingham)

[Verse 1]
Reach to the sky from the bottom
Living out the dreams that have all came true.
Trying to reach to the stars from the heavens
Neva givin' up like ya thought I'd do.

Though still,
Reach to the sky from the bottom
Living out the dreams that have all came true.
Trying to reach to the stars from the heavens
Neva givin' up like ya thought I'd do.
This is all I know. All I know.(Repeat)
This is all I know. All I know.(Repeat)

Reach to the sky from the bottom
Living out the dreams that have all came true.
Now I'm trying to reach to the stars from the heavens
Neva givin' up like ya thought I'd do.

[Repeat Verse 1]

(Never gonna stop till I reach the goal.)
This is all I know
(Now I know I'm gonna beat it. Oh~)
This is all I know
(Neva giving up like I'd thought I'd do.)
This is all I know---
