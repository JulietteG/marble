Although it's hard for me to say what's on my mind
I'm tired of messin' around and wasting precious time
We both know that this feels right
I will make it clear tonight

I'm with you
I've known it for awhile
I'm with you
(Can't live without your smile)
I'm with you
I'm with you

If I could give you the world
You know that's what I'd do
Tell me your wildest dreams
I'll make them all come true

We both know that this feels right
I will make it clear tonight

I'm with you
I've known it for awhile
I'm with you
Can't live without your smile
I'm with you
I'm with you

We can't tell what the future will be
You need to know you can count on me

I'm with you
I've known it for awhile
I'm with you
Can't live without your smile
I'm with you
I've known it for a while
I'm with you
Can't live without your smile
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you... ---
