It's hard to say, just how it
Feels, but I know when it's not
And I know when it's real
It's
Hard to describe this feeling I
Got,
But when I'm with you, I
Feel it a lot

CHORUS:
When it's just
You and me Electricity
It's easy
To see Electricity
When it's just
You and me
Whoaaa
Electricity

I like the way you
Move, when you walk my way
I like
The way you kiss, I like the
Things you say
It might be your
Lips, It might be you thong, you
Don't need a switch to turn me
On

CHORUS:
When it's just
You and me Electricity
It's easy
To see Electricity
When it's just
You and me
Whoaaa
Electricity---
