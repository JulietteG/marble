It's cold outside and I want in
The rain pours down and I wear thin
There's something more that I can't see
And can you tell me what it might be?
Til then I'll be hanging on tightly

And I don't know much
But I can feel it ever time that we touch
It's what you do to me

It's the fire in your eyes
It's the way your real thoughts hide
It's the way you make me try
Ooh and when you tell me lies
Let me inside, Let me inside, Let me inside

You're all shut in and you can't hide
I knock knock knock
I knock all night to no reply
There's a light on that I can see
And can you tell me what it might be?
I'm here as long as it shines brightly
And I don't know much
But I can feel it ever time that we touch
It's what you do to me

It's the fire in your eyes
It's the way your real thoughts hide
It's the way you make me try
Ooh and when you tell me lies
Let me inside, Let me inside, Let me inside ---
