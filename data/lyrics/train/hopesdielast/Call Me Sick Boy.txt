Take a breath and tear it apart
See things crystal clear
And then scream against me
Hurt me beat me

We were just joking like clowns
Handling life and letting it drown
"are you kidding me?"
I heard myself loud
Because I shouldn't let you go
Can't be waiting anymore

I've got enough of senseless cries
It's not easy to break through
But then scream against me
Hurt me beat me

Stand beside me
Let me see what those hands hide
Don't be scared about me
I am here just to see you die

White dressed angel let me try to take you high
Take you as high as i can fly

Stand beside me
Let me see what it tastes like
Don't be scared about me
I am here just to see you die

I committed suicide
I just died to see you cry
But don't blame me
That's my only sweet laugh
So don't blame me
I couldn't reach the afterlife
So don't hate me
Because i've never felt your heart beating
Then I fucked up mine

White dressed angel let me try to take you high
Take you as high as i can fly

Writing desperation through heartache and joyful smiles
Blue and happy at the same time---Lyrics submitted by -eMe-:D.
