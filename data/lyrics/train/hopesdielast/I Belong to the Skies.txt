I look so cool from these heights and I feel it running trought my veins
I'm here again so stop to tell me something I don't care
But you're there waiting for the things I've never said
And I'll never say because I know this smile is fake
You can't stop my running away

You tear up my wings during these years
Never leaving a moment to stay here

And if my breath will go
I'm not so sure to take your hands again
And if your Heart will go
I'll never be the same without you

I take a breath and I can feel the summer in the air
She's something I regret she's something I don't care
Useless waiting for nothing she said
She said I'll never give you a chance
This is just another heartache
Right now I am getting it all back

You tear up my wings during these years
Never leaving a moment to stay here

And if my breath will go
I'm not so sure to take your hands again
And if your Heart will go
I'll never be the same without you

It seems a perfect day
The sun is shining in my eyes
My hands are aiming to the sky
So far away from there So far away from her---Lyrics submitted by -eMe-:D.
