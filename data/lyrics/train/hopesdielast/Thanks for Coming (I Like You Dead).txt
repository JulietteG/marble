It's when I seemed to lose the only thing I care
I realized and saw its light in the night
I was beside a sparkling source of life
but sometimes I still see my death behind her smile

I'll be better with no remorse
but can I stop seeing you everywhere?
run away... things are getting worst
can I stop believing you'll be there

Lies... I used to understand them
and all this time... you've never comprehended

How do you feel? I don't believe it's real
It seems to be the sweetest thing
when the bitter ends...
I'll go crazy for no reason
'cause I can't stop that voice inside my head
anyway... your hands are getting cold
so runaway before I start to burn

Lies... I used to understand them
and all this time... you've never comprehended
I know why it was so hard to see me
I wonder if by now I can trust my eyes

So, should I stay? Should I tremble and remain?
Or run away... leaving nothing more to say?

Lies... I used to understand them
and all this time... you've never comprehended
and I know why it was so hard to see me
I wonder if by now I can trust my eyes---Lyrics submitted by PapAjefF.
