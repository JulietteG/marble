They met when he was in a hospital
he whispered "I ain't got no heart" into the room

She said "I'll make you smile again" and made an airplane
out of some pretty words put in a spoon

he said "I'll never see again...
My eyes are sorta twisted inwards, deep into my throat"

She said "don't worry babe, I'll open up your jam,
I'll open up my pretty self" and laid down on his road

She said "how do you know? Maybe you are".

She peeled his skin away, so every day he'd cry
And in those tears he'd lie to find some peace

She broke from all his words, but she was made of mercury,
She'd come together later piece by piece

And it became a game they played, under the blankets
In the bed, pretending she was small and he was big

She became so small, he could lift her, body and heart and all.
He held her up naked, she was just his fig.

She said "how do you know? Maybe you are".---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
