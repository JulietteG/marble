She checks her watch
It's just past four
She's walking into the liquor store
She's inside out
And quick to dream
With empty pockets she can barely breathe

And she waits
And she waits

[CHORUS]
Doesn't matter what they say
Just keep on walking by
You can open up their eyes
You'll get what's yours in time
So just keep on, wishing
On the stars outside your window
I know my voice will guide you home

And the only change
That comes her way
Are the nickels she finds at the entrance way
Will someone please
Clean up this mess?
Her spilled milk life has stained her dress

She's on the floor, someone get help (and she waits)
She lost control, then she lost herself (and she waits)

[CHORUS]
Doesn't matter what they say
Just keep on walking by
You can open up their eyes
You'll get what's yours in time
So just keep on, wishing
On the stars outside your window
I know my voice will guide you home
I know my voice will...

And she waits
And she waits

Doesn't matter what they say
Just keep on walking by
You can open up their eyes
You'll get what's yours in time
So just keep on, wishing
On the stars outside your window
I know my voice will guide you home

I know my voice will guide you home
I know my voice will...---Lyrics submitted by Rani.
