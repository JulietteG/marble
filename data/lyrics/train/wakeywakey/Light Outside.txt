I know you wanna stay in bed
but its light outside, its light outside
So now i'm gonna stay right here
because you saved my life once
you saved my life

and i ,will try 
to get you up cuz its beautiful outside
and we'll fall and we'll try
to do our best 
and i loved you all the while
because you saved my life once
becasue you saved my life once 

i know you wanna rest your head
and just forget that night
forget that night
so know i'm gonna stay right here
i'll sit by your side
sit by your side

and i ,will try 
to get you up cuz its beautiful outside
and we'll fall and we'll try
to do our best 
and i loved you all the while
because you saved my life once
becasue you saved my life once 
because you saved my life once
because you saved my life once
becasue you saved my life once 
because you saved my life once


i think i always knew you would be
i think i always knew you would be 
the greatest
the greatest

i think i always knew you would be
i think i always knew you would be 
the greatest
the greatest

because you saved my life once
becasue you saved my life once 
because you saved my life once
because you saved my life once---Lyrics submitted by yesenia.
