I remember when you lost your head 
Sometimes I wonder how you stay so sad when you're so beautiful 
And I remember every word you said 
How you were scared because you never been somewhere so beautiful, so beautiful 

So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good 
So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good 
And I know you can't stay but I wish you would 
Yeah I wish you would, I wish you would 

So now you tell me that you're on the mend 
Sometimes I wonder how you don't go mad when you're so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful 

So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good 
So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good 
And you know you can't stay but I wish you would 
Yeah I wish you would, yeah I wish you would 

Remember when you lost your head 
Sometimes I wonder how you stay so sad when you're so beautiful 
You're so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful 
So BEAUTIFUL, So BEAUTIFUL 

So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good 
Yeah tell me why we're talking when we dance so good 
And I know you can't stay but I wish you would 
Yeah I wish you would, yeah I wish you would---Lyrics submitted by yesenia.
