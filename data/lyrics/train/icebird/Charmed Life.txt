i got beans and a bowl of rice 
What I need 
Is some strong advice 
Then again
I'd like to be comfortable 
Give me the key to that 530 

That's right, let's be civilized 
We live a charmed life
I just can't put you aside 
Not just yet, though it's time my darling 

Took a left, and we hit the dead end 
So it went, but I think we should that again 
If you got time, then just roll on by 
When you arrive, you'll see I'm in no condition to drive 

O, this one will drive you wild 
I mean to love you, drown in light 

Tonight, let's be civilized 
We live a charmed life 
I just can't put you aside 
Not just yet, though it's time my darling 
Though it's time, my darling 
Though it's time my darling, though it's time i got it right
though it's time, lotus time

I'm alive, but I'm nowhere you would know 
I'm right here, but you think that's impossible 
Though i showed up
I can't leave your side 
Not just yet, plus I'm in no condition to drive.---Lyrics submitted by son little.
