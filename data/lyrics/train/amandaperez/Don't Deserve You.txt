Tell me have you ever loved someone so much that it makes you want to cry
Tell me have you ever loved someone that no matter what they did you needed them by your side
O Im losing my mind, steady thinking about you all the time
O Im telling you this is it, I cant live with out your kiss

Baby I know that I cant live without you in my life
But baby why cant I just do all the things thats right
O baby I know that I cant live without you in my life
But I can see it when I look at you
I can see it now that I dont deserve you

So many nights I sat and fooled with you
Not even realizing that I might lose you
Never admitting that I make mistakes.
Not having no more of them tears falling down your face
But sometimes love is hard to recognize, even when you see it with your own two eyes
Why do I feel this way in my life?
Why cant I just run and hide from all the blame that Ive given you.
Tell me why because I dont deserve you

Baby I know that I cant live without you in my life
But baby why cant I just do all the things thats right
O baby I know that I cant live without you in my life
But I can see it when I look at you, I can see it now that I dont deserve you

I dont deserve to feel your touch
O I dont deserve to feel your love
I dont deserve to feel your lips, to have your kiss
But baby I dont deserve you, I dont deserve you
O baby I know that I cant live without you in my life
But baby why cant I just do all the things thats right
O baby I know that I cant live without you in my life
But I can see it when I look at you, I can see it now
That I dont deserve you

Tell me have you ever loved someone so much that makes you want to cry
Tell me have you ever loved someone that no matter what they did you needed them by your side---Lyrics submitted by Naomi.
