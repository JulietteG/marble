Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do, what you want
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do, what you want
Look at everybody looking, strapped at our reflection, what do you see?
Strapped at the surface, searching for a purpose
Who do you wanna be?

A dick, a jane, a king is to  chain and ran your fingers  you insane
you need to get it out of your brain
And just 
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do, what you want
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do, do what you want

Making up your own rules, swimming in your own pool, 
Changing the game, haha

Give your life a good shake, do it for your own sake
Never the same
you still be anything you want and you will
Be anything as long as it's real
Do what you feel and just
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do, what you want
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do, do what you want
What is it you want

Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do, 
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do, 
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do, 
Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do.---Lyrics submitted by Jimmy Legaspi.
