Do you have a heart
behind all that armor you wear
If so how am I to know

how how how how
How do you think you're gonna fall in love
how do you think you're gonna find love
when you walk with your head into the sky
Ooo hooo
you don't want nobody to know 
you are passing by
and when someone tries to say hello
ooo hoo
you just shake your head and say no no no

(How do you think you're) oh baby 
(gonna fall in love) Baby (oooh ooooh ooooh)
(how do you think you're gonna) Oh yeah girl
(find love)

If you think you're gonna find happiness
by hiding underneath a shell
but all you'll get is sadness
by keeping to yourself

oooh
(How do you think you're gonna fall in love)
how how (how do you think you're gonna) oh baby 
(find love)

If you've been wondering why
I'm so concerned (it seems)
It's because I think I 
I think I've fallen in love with you baby
ooooooo
If I had your lovin' I promise girl
your love alone
You never know
what I want to be
want to be
in love I said yeah

(How do you think you're gonna) Oh baby 
(fall in love)(baby)
Oh baby
(how do you think you're gonna find love)

I got what you need baby
to make everything alright
but you don't want nobody
to hold and squeeze you tight
oh baby it just ain't right baby

(How do you think you're gonna) (baby) oh baby
(fall in love)
my baby
(how do you think you're gonna) my baby 
(find love)

(How do you think you're gonna fall in love)
(how do you think you're gonna find love) oooohhhh
You got everything(how do you think you're gonna) 
you got everything baby (fall in love)

Oh you're sweet (how do you think you're gonna)
oh you're fine (find love)
you can blow any man's mind
girl you got personality (how do you think you're gonna)
and you got a sweet inner quality (fall in love)
but baby
you ain't gonna find (how do you think you're gonna)
you ain't gonna find it (find love)
with your head up in the sky
aiyyyyyy (how do you think you're gonna)
baby (fall in love)
whoaaaa oooo oooo (how do you think you're gona)
whoaaaa oooo oooo oooo (find love)
whoaaa ooooo (how do you think you're gonna) 
ooooooo (fall in love)
baby howwww(how do you think you're gonna) 
(find love)---Lyrics submitted by Michael Miller.
