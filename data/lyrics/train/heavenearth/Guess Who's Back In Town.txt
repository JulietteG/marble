Been away, Been gone so long
Trying to make it on my own
Searching here and searching there
Forsaking all the love we shared
(doo ooo waaaaaaaaah)

At last I Know the world is cold
And dreams can warm a weary soul
Girl I hope your love remains
I need you now to sooth my pain

You see I was so concerned with material gain
Out in the world trying a name
Ooooo but now I must confess
Love is the key to happiness

(And it's good to know) (that you're still around)
and I said it's good to know now baby
(Guess Who) Guess who girl
ooh ohoo ho yeah hoo hoo (guess who's back in town)
(Oh it's good to know) It's good to know 
(that you're still around) that you're still aroundbaby
(guess who) guess who
guess who's back in town (guess who's back in town)
(good to know) And girl I hope(that you're still around) 
you haven't put me down yeah
(guess who) Oh guess who aaah ahh (Guess Who's back in town)
Guess who's back in town

(hiking) Hiking rides through wind and rain 
(wind and rain)
Working gigs for pocket change
(in and out) In and out(ooooooo) of small hotels
Smoked filled rooms and dredful smells
(ooh ooo Waaaaaaah)

Success I've yet That's hard to claim
And dreams sometimes give way to fact
Girl I pray you understand
At last this boy has become a man

You see I was so concerned 
with material gain
Out in the world 
trying to make a name
Oooo, but now I must confess
Love is the key to happiness

(And it's good to know) 
Oh baby, (that You're still around)
that you're still around now baby
(Guess Who)ohhh oooo Guess Who (Guess who's back in town)
