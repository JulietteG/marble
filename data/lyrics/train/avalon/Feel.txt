I'm standing in your pressence 
So why am I so numb 
Could I be too jaded 
To be overcome 
I'm tired of all my half beliefs 
And walking in my sleep 

[Chorus:] 
I want to feel crash into my heart 
I know your real but we are worlds apart 
God I've had enough of apathetic love 
I want to feel 

I'm falling at your alter empty and confused 
I want to know emotion 
I want to be consumed 
I'm desperate for the grace you give 
To let your spirit live 

[Chorus:] 
I want to feel crash into my heart 
I know your real but we are worlds apart 
God I've had enough of apathetic love 
I want to feel 

Stiring in my soul 
I want to lose control 

[Chorus:] 
I want to feel crash into my heart 
I know your real but we are worlds apart 
God I've had enough of apathetic love 
I want to feel 

God I want to feel 
[God I want to feel] 

God I want to feel 
[God I want to feel]---
