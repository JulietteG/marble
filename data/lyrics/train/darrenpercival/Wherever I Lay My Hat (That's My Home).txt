By the look in your eye
I can tell you're gonna cry
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears
I'm worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy
Who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat, that's my home
I'm telling you that's my home

You had romance, did you break it by chance
Over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy
Who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat, that's my home
I'm telling you that's my home

Oh, you keep telling me,
You keep telling me I'm your man
What do I have to do, to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy, who gives the girl the eye
Everybody knows
But I love them and I leave them
Break their hearts and deceive them
Everywhere I go
Don't you know that I'm the type of man
Who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat, that's my home
Wherever I lay my hat, that's my home
I keep saying, saying that I don't love you
Never dear, no
Lalalalal, ooooh.---Lyrics submitted by Minx Mwahzelle.
