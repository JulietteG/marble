Oh, when danger come to you
You know I'll stand beside you
Cause ain't nobody keep their head so cool
I always find a way, a way out of the fire
But don't tell nobody, tell nobody

I'm not perfect, so many things I
Wanna tell you, but I
I keep it undercover

Living my life on red alert
Doing my thing, gon' make it work
Know I'm the realest
Baby I'm fearless
But I always got your back
Nobody can do it like I can
I gotta find out who I am
Ain't gotta worry, about me
It's all part of the plan

I keep it undercover
I keep it undercover

You know, I'll always find the truth
No matter where it's hiding
So you can always run but you can't hide
Keep it classified
I'll always come out fighting
Cause it's all or nothing
All or nothing

If you're back's against the wall
Then all you gotta do is call me
I'm doing the impossible
So you just gotta trust me
Ya ain't gotta worry about it
Ain't gotta ever doubt it
I'll be there no matter what it takes
I keep it undercover---
