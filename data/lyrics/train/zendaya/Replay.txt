Make it stop, sounds so good
I just can't take no more
Turn it down, turn it up, I don't know
I don't know (know)

But don't stop, don't move
Just keep it there (right there)
Keep it right there
Keep it right there

(I wanna)
Put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go
E-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go
Put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go
E-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go

Yeah, I wanna put this song on replay
I can listen to it all day
I can listen to you all day, you all day
Yeah, I wanna put this song on replay
We can start all over again, and again
Yeah, I wanna put this song on replay

Don't stop
Turn it on, turn it up, make it louder
I don't wanna miss a single thing
I wanna hear every melody (yeah)

B-b-b-b-beating
Beating so loud you can feel it
B-b-b-b-beating
Beating for you

(I wanna)
Put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go
E-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go
Put you on repeat
Play you everywhere I go
E-e-everywhere I go
Play you everywhere I go

Yeah, I wanna put this song on replay
I can listen to it all day
I can listen to you all day, you all day
Yeah, I wanna put this song on replay
We can start all over again, and again
Yeah, I wanna put this song on replay

Rip your lid off, you know I'm crashing down
I'm so lost, I'm so lost in your sound

(Put this song on replay)
(Put this song on replay) on replay
(Put this song on replay) on replay
Lis-listen to you all day, to you all day

Yeah, I wanna put this song on replay
I can listen to it all day
I can listen to you all day, you all day
Yeah, I wanna put this song on replay
We can start all over again, and again
Yeah, I wanna put this song on replay
