I can't say I'm an expert on it
 In fact, it's a first time
 Anybody's made me feel the way you do, boy

 It seems like it should be real easy
 With two people so right
 And yet, I find myself just waiting here
 Like I'm just your toy

 You take me in, I take you back
 Baby, what's the problem?
 How we gonna solve it?
 But when I call, you don't call back
 Being with your boys is always more important

 I cry for love
 I don't think I'm supposed to
 Cry for love
 It's something wrong with me, maybe I'm not
 Cry for love
 Sometimes I wonder why I even
 Try for us
 I shouldn't have to cry for love

 Oh, no, oh, no
 I really wanna ask my girls
 But they'll think I'm a fool
 So much for watching all those fairytales
 With happy endings

 I wish I could've been prepared
 For all your stupid games
 I need to give it up
 'Cause I don't have a chance at winning

 You take me in, I take you back
 Baby, what's the problem?
 How we gonna solve it?
 But when I call, you don't call back
 Being with your boys is always more important

 I cry for love
 I don't think I'm supposed to
 Cry for love
 It's something wrong with me, maybe I'm not
 Cry for love
 Sometimes I wonder why I even
 Try for us
 I shouldn't have to cry for love

 What am I doing? What am I doing?
 This doesn't happen to girls like me
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
 Seeing your eyes red is not a cute thing

 I don't wanna cry no more
 I don't wanna cry no more
 I got too much pride to be in my room asking why

 I cry for love
 I don't think I'm supposed to
 Cry for love
 It's something wrong with me, maybe I'm not
 Cry for love
 Sometimes I wonder why I even
 Try for us
 I shouldn't have to cry for love

 I cry for love
 I don't think I'm supposed to
 Cry for love
 It's something wrong with me, maybe I'm not
 Cry for love
 Sometimes I wonder why I even
 Try for us
 I shouldn't have to cry for love---Lyrics submitted by naomi neal.
