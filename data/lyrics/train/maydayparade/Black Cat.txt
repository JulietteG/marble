Close up camera one
The hero sings in this scene
The boy that gets the girl
Gets to go home where they get married
But stop the tape 
The sunset still looks fake to me
The hero looks like he cant breathe
The damsel just left everything

Your Like a black cat
With a black backpack
Full of fireworks
And your gonna burn the city down right now
Whoa oh, whoa oh
Your Like a black cat
With a black backpack
Full of fireworks
And your gonna burn the city down right now
Whoa oh, whoa oh

Close up camera two
'Cause the hero dies in this scene
Your inspiration is the loss
Of absolutly everything
And flashback on the girl
And we montage every memory
And we bleed on in the bathroom sink
And we bleed out as the soundtrack sings

Your Like a black cat
With a black backpack
Full of fireworks
And your gonna burn the city down right now
Whoa oh, whoa oh
Your Like a black cat
With a black backpack
Full of fireworks
And your gonna burn the city down right now
Whoa oh, whoa oh

She said get your hands off of my star
It's not your part
But all your fault
And this jealous actress has a habit
Of making things sound way too tragic

Get your hands off of my star
It's not your part
But all your fault
And this jealous actress has a habit
Of making things sound way too tragic

And this jealous actress has a habit (of making things sound way to tragic)
And this jealous actress has a habit (of making things sound way to tragic)

Your Like a black cat
With a black backpack
Full of fireworks
And your gonna burn the city down right now
Whoa oh, whoa oh

Your Like a black cat
With a black backpack
Full of fireworks
And your gonna burn the city down right now
Whoa oh, whoa oh
(Oh my God!)
Your Like a black cat
With a black backpack
Full of fireworks
And your gonna burn the city down right now
Whoa oh, whoa oh

And this jealous actress has a habit 
whoa oh---Lyrics submitted by Diane.
