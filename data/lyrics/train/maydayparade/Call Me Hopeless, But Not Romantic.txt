I can't believe that so much time was spent on my own
Just trying to figure it out all alone.
Don't show emotion, let this go.

I can't pretend that everything is still okay
Until you rightfully say what you said
About how you left me here for dead, for dead.

Why do you cry when you're falling asleep?
And, girl, how can you love without ever losing it all?
Don't put your faith in this.
We won't believe it.

Where did you go?
How will you find yourself
When your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself
You're losing hope, losing hope?

Is it just me,
Or has this time we spent come undone?
I know forever is not what you want.
I'll pack my bags and brush it off, brush it off.

Why do you cry when you're falling asleep?
And, girl, how can you love without ever losing it all?
Don't put your faith in this.
We won't believe it.

Where did you go?
How will you find yourself
When your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself
You're losing hope, losing hope?

Tell me that you're alright.
Yeah, like I really care.
Why do we fight sometimes?
Just like we always do.
Try to make up your mind.
I'll make it up with you.
Try to make up your mind, your mind,
Your mind, your mind.

Where did you go?
How will you find yourself
When your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself
You're losing hope, losing hope?

Where did you go?
How will you find yourself
When your hand to hold is letting go?
Where did you go?
How will you tell yourself
You're losing hope, losing hope,
Losing hope?---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
