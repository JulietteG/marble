Well I thought that we could sit around and talk for hours
About things I couldn't say to you
And things that we could never do and,
This conversation has had no face
When the words take days you can re-write and erase anything

You know my heart (so tell me all that's needed, cause i don't really want this)
Knows all this lines

And I'll borrow words from all our favorite paragraphs
To write a ballad while we say the things
We hope would mean the most to me
And
Each letter sent i have found in the pages the hope for the days when i feel like I've lost
Everything

You know my heart (so tell me honestly, do you ever really want this)
Knows all these lines (cause my jealous heart can't take this)
I'll sing this song for every word that's come out wrong

But, I'll be ok (Is that what you want me to say)
It's called breakup
Cause it's broken
And I'll be ok (is that what you want me to say)
It's called breakup
Cause it's broken

I'll be ok
Is that what you want me to say
It's called Breakup
Cause it's broken
[repeats]

I'll be ok, is that what you want me to say
Cause it's broken
And you were just about to tell me 
how you meant that you were sorry
and the nights we spent, i know they meant the world to you
I'm keeping track of every note, every page
the things you wrote 
the cherry flavored kisses while I chase them 
do you miss it?

I'll be ok
Is that what you want me to say
It's called Breakup
Cause it's broken
[x2]

Well I thought that we could sit around and, talk for hours
About things I couldn't say to you
And things that we could never do---Lyrics submitted by shelby.
