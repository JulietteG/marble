She's in love
And the world gets blurry
She makes mistakes
And she's in no hurry to grow up
'Cause grownups they don't understand her

Well it's a big, big world out there
But she's not scared
She thinks that nobody cares about her problems
And she's probably right

But it's alright
You'll be fine
If you just stay with me

Whoa oh, whoa oh
We get one step closer but we're still so far away
Whoa oh, whoa oh
It's too bad empty bottles couldn't save her life today

She finds hope in the strangest places
She reads her books
And she knows the faces of everyone
That ever said she's alone

She knows every word to the saddest songs
And she sings along
Though her friends all tell her
That she can't sing

But it's alright
You'll be fine
If you just listen to me

Whoa oh, whoa oh
We get one step closer but we're still so far away
Whoa oh, whoa oh
It's too bad empty bottles couldn't save her life today

She's eighteen
Much too young to know what a kiss like that would mean
But her lips, they weren't no stranger to the touch
And she liked it way too much

She never listened to a word her daddy told her
She finds company with her cigarettes
And feels alone when the sunset...

And please
Don't let this be love
Or can it be enough?
This college town is too small for both of us
So we're running away
We'll pack our bags and take the first train
And we're getting the hell out of here
This place could burn for all we care

(Getting the hell out of here)
This place could burn for all we care
(This place could burn for all we care)
(Getting the hell out of here)
Hold me till then
(This place could burn for all we care)
(Getting the hell out of here)
This place could burn for all we care
(This place could burn for all we care)
(Getting the hell out of here)
Hold me till then
(This place could burn for all we care)

Whoa oh, whoa oh (This place could burn for all we care)
We get one step closer but we're still so far away (Hold me till then)
Whoa oh, whoa oh (This place could burn for all we care)
It's too bad empty bottles couldn't save her life today (Hold me till then)
(Hold me till then)---Lyrics submitted by Sky Shaw.
