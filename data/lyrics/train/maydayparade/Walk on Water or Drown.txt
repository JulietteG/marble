Well this hurts me more than I can stand to say in just one sitting.
You left the room so I could pray.
So I pace the halls to see if I could find a hole in something.
Or maybe places to escape.
Oh, and everybody knows this is the part of breaking down in anybody's arms.
I'm reaching down and hoping this one's ours, God, please let me stay.

And then I fell into pieces and she fell into me.
Saying play me a song it's been too long since I've heard you sing.
You got here just in time to let me know I was worth saving.
If nothing more than for the heart.
Too proud to breath but all too scared to say the things worth saying.
Who knew this trip would be this hard.
As I'm looking to the sky to count the stars, I wonder if you see them where you are.
I'm down on both my knees to pray tomorrow brings no pain.
And then I fell into pieces and she fell into me.
Saying play me a song it's been too long since I've heard you sing.
And, we all fall to pieces, but at least you fell to me.
But this is the wrong night, so tell me goodnight and let it go.
I stayed here and you just prayed.
My head would clear, and I'd stay safe.
The pieces left ,the love is changed just saved everything.
Oh, but everybody knows this is the part of breaking down in anybody's arms.
I'm reaching down and hoping this one's ours, God, please let me stay.
And then I fell into pieces and she fell into me.
Saying play me a song it's been too long since I've heard you sing.
And then I fell into pieces and she fell into me.
Saying play me a song it's been too long since I've heard you sing.
And, we all fall to pieces, but at least you fell to me.
But this is the wrong night, so tell me goodnight and let it go---Lyrics submitted by chelsea.
