Hear the sound
As she whispers in your ear
It's the saddest song, begging to come home

Hear the sound
As she whispers in your ear
It's the saddest song, begging to come home

Hear the sound
As a telephone crashes down
You can hear it from, the east and west coast

So promise you'll find the strength,
To hold on for one more day

I lost myself on Saturday
This keeps reminding me, I need to find my wings
And bless your heart and bless this family name
I'd write a thousand songs, just to keep you calm
On your journey home

Hear the sound
As your heart falls to the floor
It's a wonder that you'll need it any more

Hear the sound of love worth writing down
All across this empty town
It's the saddest song, begging to come home

If I could just fight the pain (just fight the pain),
Whatever made you that way

I lost myself on Saturday
This keeps reminding me, I need to find my wings
And bless your heart and bless this family name
I'd write a thousand songs, just to keep you calm
On your journey home

If she can swim then I'm going down
I swore it as I'm starting to drown
If anyone got no place to go

So just bury me beside you (bury me beside you)
Can't think about the way that it hurts (the way that it hurts)
When every single word that you spoke
Meant more to me than you'll ever know
Than you'll ever know (than you'll ever know)

I lost myself on Saturday (I lost myself on Saturday)
This keeps reminding me, I need to find my wings
And bless your heart and bless this family name
I'd write a thousand songs, just to keep you calm
On your journey home (on your journey home)
On your journey home---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
