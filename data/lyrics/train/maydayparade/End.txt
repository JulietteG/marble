We tried to fight for what we thought
that we believed in
maybe it was all for nothing
( i bet that it was all for nothing )

So we drive, cause we like to be alone
There's no where for us to go
There's no where for us to go

How can you think that any of this was easy
with all the friends I've lost along the way?

When this is over
We're all getting older now
And we all play a part in it

Innocence is falling
Can you hear them calling now?
But I'll be by your side til' the end.

We tried to fight
I guess sometimes you find it's pointless
As long as you can live with yourself
( Tell me how you live with yourself )

So it's time that we take the open road
There's no where for us to go
There's no where for us to go.

How can you think that any of this was easy
with all the friends I've lost along the way?

When this is over
We're all getting older now
And we all play a part in it

Innocence is falling
Can you hear them calling now?
But I'll be by your side til' the end.

To all my friends let's make this count
We're not alone
Not alone.

How can you think that any of this was easy
with all the friends I've lost along the way?

When this is over
We're all getting older now
And we all play a part in it

Innocence is falling
Can you hear them calling now?
But I'll be by your side til' the end.---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
