And you said it would be funny
To keep me hanging in suspense
Then I'd run over to your house 
And I'd scale the chainlink fence
That borders your back yard 
And then I'd climb through your window
And I'd whisper that I love you 
As you fall out of your clothes
And we'd lay there in the darkness 
Like the dream of you I had
Where we captured all the fireflies
And we knew what time we had
Could be counted on our fingertips
And that almost made you cry
But you let me hold you tightly 
As we said all our goodbyes 


And may I say I loved you more
May I say I loved you more


And it must of been and hour 
That I clutched you in my arms 
And I must have said the right 
Things because you instantly felt warm
And you heard my heart stop beating 
And you wanted not to cry
As your sympathetic whispers 
They told a tale of bad goodbyes
You swore you saw me laughing 
And I swore I saw you smile
As the time we've spent together 
Was meant to last us quite a while
As I take this piece of you with me 
I'll carry to my grave
And knowing that for someone 
You're an angel sent to save


(Keep Breathing my angel, if you go down I go with you
Keep breathing, just keep breathing.)
May I saw I loved you more


So let's drink to memories we shared
Down one for all the hopes and cares
Here's too for being unaware that you're gone
Because before too long you'll be a memory---Lyrics submitted by Ashleen.
