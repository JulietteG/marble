She's got all my dreams
I've got these broken things
And they always disagree
But if there's one real thing you would choose to believe
Just don't lose your faith in me

She's got broken things where her heart should be
And I keep rolling them over in my head
Make my voice brand new

I'll give it all to you
And I'll never speak again

Lord I've been trading places with the ghost in me
And it's starting to make me sick
But if there's one real thing I could choose to believe
Just a little hope would do the trick

She's got broken things where her heart should be

But I can tell there are moments when I'm really getting through
Make my voice brand new
I'll give it all to you
And I'll never speak again

She'll be in magazines with all her fancy things
And all the boys will dream
If you think this was easy you're wrong
And now it's time

Let me see a smile

She's got broken things where her heart should be
And I keep rolling it over in my head
If your heart is true then I'll be with you
Cause it's you that I adore
And we both know I loved you more---Lyrics submitted by Karl Dailey.
