This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs,
I absolutely love her when she smiles

How many days in a year
She woke up with hope but she only found tears?
And I can be so insincere 
Making her promises, never for real

As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear
When you look in the mirror, so how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs,
I absolutely love her when she smiles

How many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this shit day after day?
How did we wind up this way
Watching our mouths for the words that we say?

As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
How do we get there today
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there,
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Well, your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs,
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Her pretty face, she hid from the world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there,
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs,
I absolutely love her when she smiles
When she smiles---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
