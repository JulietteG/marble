I've seen the ocean in the morning while it's calm
I've seen a baby sleeping in his mother's arms
And I've seen couples find each other in the dark
And I see us together again, even if it's only in my heart
I seen colors on a canvas turn to art
And I've seen people who search for answers in the stars
And I've seen days when no one talks to me but God
I can see us together again, even if only in my heart

Before the heavens open up
We might just find that we're still in love
If you let me
I believe that one day you'll be back in my arms, love
I don't care how long I just keep holding on until you are
If you let me
I believe that we're not over while we're apart
It might not be smart but you're still my lady, if only in my heart
If only in my heart
Only in my heart
If only in my heart
You're still my number 1 if only only only

I keep a photo in my wallet of us two
I keep on dreaming every dream I have is you
Keep saying I throw it away but never do
Keep wondering when did I become the shameless fool
Saying do you ever think of me at all
Keep praying that it's you each time that someone calls
Keep thinking why the hell is we even apart
I keep holding out hope for us, if only in my heart

Before the heavens open up we might just find that we're still in love
If you let me,
I believe that one day you'll be back in my arms, love
I don't care how long I just keep holding on until you are
If you let me,
I believe that we're not over while we're apart
It might not be smart but you're still my lady if only in my heart,
If only in my heart
Only in my heart
If only in my heart
You're still my number 1 you're still...

Tears on the pillow of the man that let the finest stock of diamonds slip right out of his hands.
Call me a fool.
And I don't know what to do without her here next to me
Oh no no
While her body use to keep me warm
I'm gonna wait everyday until you're right back in my arms

If you let me
I believe that one day you'll be back in my arms, love
I don't care how long I just keep holding on until you are
If you let me
I believe that we're not over while we're apart
It might not be smart but you're still my lady if only in my heart,
If only in my heart
Only in my heart
If only in my heart
You're still my number 1
You're still, still
My...
I can't deny
No...---
