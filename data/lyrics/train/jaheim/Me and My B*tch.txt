Sitting here with carats in your ears, mink on your back, your bank account 
stacked
You deserve everything you got cause you held me down when things got hot on 
the block
Looking back I remember the days when shit got thick you were the first to say 
"Baby keep your head up, it will be ok" 
You're better off without that kind of bad ass nigga anyway

[Chorus:]
It's on tonight Cash up in the dash and I'm feelin right
Got heat up in the seat just in case of beef
for anyone who wanna come test me and my baby
Honey don't be afraid See this cat ridin in that Escalade
plotting on my riches yeah he will get slayed 
Messin 'round with me and my lady, me and my bitch

[Verse 2]
You're a dream you're my ghetto queen If I ain't got nobody else I know I got 
you on my team
So I knock, get the cake, cop the rocks, meet your pops then move your whole 
family off the block
Still niggas talking this and that Jah don't how to treat you don't know how to 
act You're a good girl you deserve better than that when in fact accounts are 
major got your name attached

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
It's on tonight do what you like 
Whatever's wrong I'll make it right
Got your back count on that
Whatever you need I'm down for you cause
You're on my team you're my everything
Your doe gettin low girl I gots to pay
So tonight it's all on you so won't you let your
boy know what you trying to do
