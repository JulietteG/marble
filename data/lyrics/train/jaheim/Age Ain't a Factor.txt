My my my my, my my my, my, my, my, my, my, my
My baby, my baby, my baby
What a lady, girl
Ooooooh

Youre like a wine, you get better with time
Got your Nia Long on, its your song, youre so fine
From everything that you wear, your kind of beauty is rare
And I swear you get better lookin with every year!
Uh, uh, at your sexual peak, your full figure physique
Young girl, cant compete, come pluck me lil somethin to eat, baby
And since were in the kitchen, girl let me get that muffin
You look better the older you get - Benjamin Button!

[Chorus:]
I cant believe with time, girl youre getting better
Looking like a picture of before and after
Your story gets more pretty every chapter
Gettin more attractive, age aint a factor!
Youre more than I got, Im bout to leave her
Cause berries sittin on the vine, with time are sweeter
If I can be your man, girl, you wont want for nothin
You look better the older you get - Benjamin Button!

You really need to let me in your world, girl What a proud girl!
No cougar youre still a kitten, hidden
You working out, girl, shut your mouth, youre looking thicker
You know how to hold your liquor
Nigga show me your ID, I get the picture
I propose a toast, playas raise your glass
for my Vivica Foxes and my Stacy Dashes
Ladies, its Thanksgiving and Im about to eat that stuffing
You look better the older you get - Benjamin Button!

[Chorus:]
I cant believe with time, girl youre getting better
Lookin like a picture of before and after
Your story gets more pretty every chapter
More and more attractive, age aint a factor!
Youre more than I got, Im bout to leave her
Cause berries sitting on the vine, with time are sweeter
If I can be your man, youll never want for nothin
You look better the older you get - Benjamin Button!

Effortless, make it look so easy
Cajun spice seasoning, sexy for no reason
Appetite pleasing, bout to sink my teeth in
If I tell them how good your love is they wouldnt believe me!

[Chorus: (2x)]
I cant believe with time, girl youre getting better
Looking like a picture of before and after
Your story gets more pretty every chapter
More and more attractive, age aint a factor!
Youre more than I got, Im bout to leave her
Cause berries sitting on the vine, with time are sweeter
If I can be your man, youll never want for nothin
You look better the older you get - Benjamin Button!
I cant believe with time, girl youre getting better
Looking like a picture of before and after
Ooooohh, age aint a factor
Youre more than I got, Im bout to leave her
Cause berries sitting on the vine, with time are sweeter
If I can be your man, girl, you wont want for nothin
You look better the older you get - Benjamin Buttons! ---Lyrics submitted by Tawnee.
