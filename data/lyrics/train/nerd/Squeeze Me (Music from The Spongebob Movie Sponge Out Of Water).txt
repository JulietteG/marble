Play with us before we melt 
Errybody enjoy yourself 
The best part is the middle of me 
Im your sponge baby go on and squeeze 

Im better than pillows, wont you believe me 
Squeeze me 

Squeeze me till I pop 
Squeeze me till you drop 
Yeah, here we go now 
Yeah, here we go now 

Im like cute aggression, wont you believe me 
Squeeze me 

Dang, dang, diggy-dang 
Everybody in the rain 
Tell me shine like a chain 
Wipe it up like a stain 
Uppercut, yup again 
A double dutch with Lil Wayne 
Do it till you vomit again 
The job done now 

So refreshing, wont you believe me 
Squeeze me 

Oh how are you now 
Come again with the hot smile 
Hydro glow style 
Jellyfish with the hot gals 
Adidas let me go far out 
So you could be the superstar now 
Get a big head thats round 
Mrs Puff style 

Better than your teddy bear, wont you believe me 
Squeeze me---
