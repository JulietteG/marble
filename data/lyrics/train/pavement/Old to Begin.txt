Embrace the senile genius
Watch him renvent the wheel
I don't need your summary acts, summary acts
To give into the narrative age
Old to begin
I will set you back, set you back, set you
Old to begin
I will set you back, set you back, set you
You get to feeling like a fixture
Set in 1966
Time came that we drifted apart, drifted apart
Find an unidentical twin
Old to begin
I will set you back, set you back, set you
Old to begin
I will set you back, set you back, set you
Search for a blatant cause
Blame it on menopause
Or perhaps stress and strain
Credit cards lumbar pain
But I've called you double dare
Everything extraordinaire
I know the things you do call to come back
La la la la la
La la la la la---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
