I dont need empty love words comin from somebody that'll never love me like you do
I dont need to feel the warm touch from somebody else cuz no other touch could be this true. 
They cant reach me cuz im tied to 

Chorus:
One woman youre for me, i know that youre all ill ever need
Forever, beside you, spending my life loving one woman

Everything about you, inside and out is perfect
Over the edge I always fall
Everytime i see you the way i feel reminds me the world i knew just seemed so small
cuz now with you i have it all

Chorus:
One woman youre for me, i know that youre all i ever need
forever, beside you, spending my life loving one woman

back when i was selfish, i thought i needed more
but that road lead me nowhere and ive closed that door, 
now i live for

ONE WOMAN, YOURE FOR ME, I KNOW THAT YOURE ALL I EVER NEED
FOREVER, BESIDE YOU, SPENDING MY LIFE LOVING ONE WOMAN---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
