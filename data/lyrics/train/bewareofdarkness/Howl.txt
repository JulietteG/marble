Lay down, heaven can wait
You think youre right, I think you can change
Draw some blood, Im not going hungry tonight
Wont it be fun, to Howl in the night?

Howl  So that the angels can hear you

Refrain:
Yeah
Catch me if you can
My, my, my,
Im a hungry man
Oh oh
Catch me if I fall
Baby girl I wanna hear you howl!

Cut strings you think too much
I cant wait this long for a rush
A misery to be alone
Howd you want to be the lonely one?

Howl  So that the angels can hear you

[Refrain]

(I want to hear you Howl)

Oh child when will you see the light?
No no I wont give up the fight
No no when will you see the light?
Oh child I wont give up the fight
