Computer, whats the point in this?
You do all the thinking where we -
Just digging shelters in the snow -
Build a house of dream and domino

I know its fallen down
Got my headphones on and I wont hear a sound
No its all broke down
Eyes out on the road but no-one comes along, when you want them to

Let your hair hang long
Yeah that old north wind is blowing through these cracked up ports
And you wont feel so strong
Voices on the street, yeah its closing time, again

Computer, whats the point in this?
You do all the thinking where we -
Just building shelters in the snow -
Build a house of dream and domino

I know its fallen down
Got my headphones on and I wont hear a sound
Yeah its all broke down
Eyes out on the road but no-one comes along, when you want them to---Lyrics submitted by bim.
