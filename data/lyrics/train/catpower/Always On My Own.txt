I was always on my own

Look in my eyes and see the one
Funny nonsense, on and on
Tell me no lie, under your love
Back to back, tick tock, has begun

Look in my eyes and see the one
Funny nonsense, on and on
Tell me no lie, under your love
Back to back, tick tock, has begun

Oh, oh, work your love
Oh, oh, work your love
Oh, oh, work your love

I want to live my way of living
I want to live my way of living
I want to live my way of living---
