M not Snow White, but Im lost inside this forest
Im not Red Riding Hood, but I think the wolves have got me
Dont want those stilettos, Im not, not Cinderella
I dont need a knight, so baby, take off all your armor

You be the Beast and Ill be the Beauty-beauty
Who needs true love as long as you love me truly
I want it all, but I want you more
Will you wake me up, boy, if I bite your poison apple

I dont believe in fairytales (no no no)
I dont believe in fairytales (no no no)
I dont believe in fairytales, But I believe in you and me
Take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Wonderland, Wonderland

When I lay my head down to go to sleep at night
My dreams consist of things thatd make you wanna hide
Dont let me in your tower, show me your magic powers
Im not afraid to face a little bit of danger, danger

I want the love, the money and the perfect ending
You want the same as I-I so stop pretending
I wanna show how ya, good we can be together
I wanna love you through the night, Ill be your sweet disaster

I dont believe in fairytales (no no no)
I dont believe in fairytales (no no no)
I dont believe in fairytales, But I believe in you and me
Take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Wonderland, Wonderland, Wonderland

Woah-oh oh, woah-oh oh, woah
I believe in you and me

I dont believe in fairytales ( no no no)
I dont believe in fairytales ( no no no)
I dont believe in fairytales, But I believe in you and me
Take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to

I believe in you and me, Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to, take me to, take me to Wonderland
Take me to wonderland, take me to Wonderland---Lyrics submitted by lol.
