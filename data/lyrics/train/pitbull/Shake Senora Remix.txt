Oh yeah shawty whats hapnin
Girl let's get this thing crackin
You just bend it on over,
I'll get behind and you can get wild

Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine

Shake, shake, shake senora
Shake it left and right
Work, work, work senora
Right into my right

With no religion, make them believers
I always get two, call me Jeter
Sean Paul, Pain, Pitbull, and Luda
We about bread, paper and...

Senorita, sh-sh-sh-shake it
Que la dejo mojadita

Mal hablado y fresco
Dame duro mamita, dame lento

Oh yeah shawty whats hapnin
Girl let's get this thing crackin
You just bend it on over,
I'll get behind and you can get wild

Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine

Hey mamacita, tu es #mover# bonita

Hotter than lava, shake it like two maracas
Bend down and touch your toes
Then hop inside this custom rolls
Two shots of tequeila, manos pa' arriba
Now bring it back 
Bring it till you put it right inside my lap
Make it clap, drop it low 
The mamies call me papa #dope#
Too much #dope#, too much cash
I cant think straight with all this ass
I gotta lighten up like sammy sosa
And live la vida loca!

Oh yeah shawty whats hapnin
Girl let's get this thing crackin
You just bend it on over,
I'll get behind and you can get wild

Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine
Jump in the line, shake your body on mine

Shake, shake, shake senora
Shake it left and right
Work, work, work senora
Right into my right
