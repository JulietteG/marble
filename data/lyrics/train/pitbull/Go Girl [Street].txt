(What would the music be 
without sounds) 

[ Pitbull ] 
Young Boss, Miss Trina, Pitbull 
Let's show them how 
we get down 

I party like a rockstar, 
Look like a movie star, 
Play like an all star, 
Fuck like a pornstar, 
Baby I'm a superstar, 
Always posted at the bar 
Always with a couple broads 
Maybe I'm just that that raw 
Dawg check the resume 
I hit something everyday 
Ask about me n' dey say 
That chico run M.I.A 
Pitbull, young boss 
That's fire 
Go girl work it out 
'Til u tired 
Just tryin' to pay your tuition Liar 
My corner is like HBO's wire 
So please don't play no games 
And baby don't say no names 
And we can do this 
one more again 
Next time you can 
bring your friends 

So get your friends 
And I'll get my friends 
And we can be friends 
Do this every weekend 

[ Pre-Hook ] 
We can hit your place 
We can hit my place 
She's on my top 8 
I bagged her off of myspace 

[ Chorus ] 
Go girl [ x8 ] 
Shake them dice and 
roll them [ x2 ] 
When they ask u 
what's that dance

[ Young Boss ] 
Girl I wanna know your name 
Girl who u be? 
Don't care with who you came 
As long as u leave wit' me 
What's you sippin' on? 
I buy your drink 
Get u one of them shiny things 
Your grill be pink 
I see those Jimmy Choos 
Those Vera Wangs 
I luv the way u work 
Girl do your thing 
U see my stunna shades 
I'm like a star 
My clique is full of ballas 
We at the bar 

So go get your friends 
And I get my friends 
And we can be friends 
Do this every weekend 

[ Pre-Hook ] 
We can hit your place 
We can hit my place 
She's on my top 8 
I bagged her off of myspace 

[ Chorus ] 

[ Trina ] 
Diamond princess 
I make them bust quick 
When I back it up 
Like a Mack Truck 
[ heavy breathing ] 
Don't talk about it boy 
Be about it boy 
I got them girls boy 
Turn out your girls boy 
I'm talking freak nig 
I'm like a freaky shit 
Cuz you're my freak 

So get your friends 
And I'll get my friends 
And we can be friends 
Do this every weekend 

[ Pre-Hook ] 

Go girl [ x8 ] 
Shake them dice and 
roll them [ x2 ] 
When they ask u 
what's that dance 
You say that's the hustle man 

Are you ready for this? 
Uh huh.---Lyrics submitted by soha.
