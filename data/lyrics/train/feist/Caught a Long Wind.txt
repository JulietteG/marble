Little bird, have you got a key?
Unlock the lock inside of me.
Where will you go?
Keep yourself afloat.
Feeling old until the wings unfolded,
Caught me a long wind.
Where will we go?
Keep ourselves afloat.

Caught a long wind,
A long life wind.
I got to know the sky,
But it didn't know me.
I got to see the light,
And land on top of the sea.
And be the bird, be the key.
And now the current tells
What the wave withheld,
And then the lightning say
Oh, where the light will lie.
Where will you go?
Keep yourself afloat.

Caught a long wind,
A long life wind.
Like a swallow, 
A night owl,
A little chickadee,
Sad sparrow, 
Good morning bird,
Good nightingale.
I took a deep breath, 
And caught a long wind.---Lyrics submitted by Sunny Akane.
