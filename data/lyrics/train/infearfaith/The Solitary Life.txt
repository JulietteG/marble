Watch me don't follow me
I'm failing my family
Becoming a tragedy
You can't stop this by any means
I wont give an apology
So watch me build tolerance
I don't need any deliverance

As I recall it was unbearable
It's all in my head
We've already lost a significant amount of time
You know I couldn't fake this if I tried
I realize that the single life is not the average alibi
We've all been ready for the lonely life

This is tearing me apart
Maybe it's not for me maybe someone else should be
Tearing themselves apart
Then again maybe I'm right where I'm supposed to be... 

They always say that the only way
Is to promise yourself to stay
There's so many of you that come to watch me die
They always say that we have to be
What they're waiting for
But you're letting it all go by

We've already lost a significant amount of time
You know I couldn't fake this if I tried
I realize that the single life is not the average alibi
We've all been ready for the lonely life

Watch me don't follow me
Our lives have been running out
And we're fine with where we're heading now.---Lyrics submitted by Carlos.
