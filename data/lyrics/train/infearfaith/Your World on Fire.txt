I need to see you step away from the edge,
I've seen this coming and you're better off alone.
Well it's safe to say,
That you were the one without a plan.
And you've missed the point,
You put the blood on my hands.

Why aren't you trying to escape,
From the fire that I have made.
I won't be the one that kills you...
Now you will find your murderer is.
You build the walls that kept you alone,
I tore them down, just to watch you rebuild.
You built this house to hide from everything you fear,
I merely showed you how to tear that building down.

Why aren't you trying to escape,
From the fire that I have made.
This time will be a little different,
This time will be the one that pulls you out.
I can hear you scream, far from the way.
And you, could be. So much more than this.

But your foundation is weak,
And in time these walls must come down.
Why don't you save all the trouble and pull yourself out.
Take some gas and a match and burn it to the ground!
Watch the flames surround,
Watch all your fears fall like ashes all around.
Just don't forget that you're the one who brought it down.
You did this on your own, all I did was show you how.

With your head pounding harder than your heart,
And you feel that you're stuck where you are.
With your lungs filled with smoke,
And you know that you're heading towards the dark.
When it seems like this scene never ends,
Then the least you can do is pretend.
That the life you've been living is leading you out of the dark.

Why aren't you trying to escape,
From the fires that I have made.
Now you can be free from every fear that you had,
That tore you apart.
I can hear you scream, far from the way,
I can say that I've brought you back.
That I've done my deed, so I can finally go to sleep.
Now you can be free from every fear that you had,
So I can finally go to sleep---Lyrics submitted by Ricky.
