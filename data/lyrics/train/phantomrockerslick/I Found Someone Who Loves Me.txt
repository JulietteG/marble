I think I deserve a little bit more
but I swallow what you give me,
I'm crying out loud from under this cloud,
at least you can listen to me.
I'm thinking 'bout you,
I can't touch you.
Something just went wrong here:
love is a poison, gone is the fear.

You think you deserve a little bit more sorry
swallow what I give you.
I 'm losing my hate, my new love awaits;
I just can't listen to you.
You're crying 'bout me,
you can't touch me.
Something just went right here:
love is a blessing,
gone is the fear.

I got something to say that might change your day.
I got something to say that might change your day.
I found someone who loves me.---Lyrics submitted by tac.
