i remember summer
of nineteen ninety three
she was tall and blonde and tan and man
she was all in love with me

she started talkin bout our future 
and it scared me half to death
so i ran away but to this day
her memory takes my breath

should've seen her smile
should've heard her laugh
oh, the way her eyes woud dance
when she brushed her hair back

she could've been mine
she would've been in another place and time
she would've been, she could've been mine
she could've been mine

home for the holidays
a friends party, new years eve
i turned around and found familiar
blues eyes staring back at me

a little girl came running up
i took her by the hand
and a memory in miniature said,
mommy whos that man

should've seen her smile
should've heard her laugh
oh, the way her eyes just danced
when she brushed her hair back

she could've been mine
she would've been in another place and time
now and then i go there in my mind
she would've been, she should've been,
she could've been mine, mine, mine

in another place and time
mine, mine, mine
could've been, 
should've been, would've been
could'e been all mine
should've been all mine---Lyrics submitted by savannah.
