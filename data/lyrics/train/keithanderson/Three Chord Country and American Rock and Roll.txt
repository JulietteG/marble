Yeah...
How 'bout a little fiddle?
That sounds good

Cut of Wranglers an' bikini's on the railroad bridge
Dive into the river then climb up an' jump again
When the sun is settin' we head down to the beer barn
Grab a couple keggers then we roll out to the farm
Where's the band now?

Park our pick-ups in a circle
Let the tailgates down
Laugh while everybody's gettin' drunk as Cooter Brown
Crankin' everything from Brooks & Dunn to Areosmith
Out here in the country that's the way we get our kicks

Yeah...
Like ta' keep in simple y'all
In everything we do
Got our own kind of laid back livin'
If you don't mind
Thank you
We love the kind of music
You can feel down in your soul
Give us Three Chord Country
And American Rock & Roll

We like to pick our guitars with the neighbors all night long
Sip on Granny's moonshine as we sing Bocephus songs
Listen to ol' Grandad preach about Red, White, An' Blue
An' how he kicked
Hitler's ass in 1942

Yeah...
Like ta' keep in simple y'all
In everything we do
Got our own kind of laid back livin'
If you don't mind
Thank you
We love the kind of music
You can feel down in your soul
Give us Three Chord Country
And American Rock & Roll

Old dogs
An' watermelon wine
Does us just fine
Little pink houses
An' I walk the line
It doesn't take much
Ta' have ourselves a good time

Yeah...
Like ta' keep in simple y'all
In everything we do
Got our own kind of laid back livin'
If you don't mind
Thank you
We love the kind of music
You can feel down in your soul
Give us Three Chord Country
And American Rock & Roll

Yeah...
Give Three Chord Country...
And American Rock & Roll...
Tell me now...
Does fortworth ever cross your mind, now darling
I'm wanted dead or alive...---Lyrics submitted by Kayla.
