You'll find me here
From happy hour to closing time
The jukebox is playing the same old song
A hundred times
Bartender looks at me
With the saddest eyes
When I say 'Keep 'em coming, 'till i'm stumbling
The way you did last night'

I ain't hurting nobody but me
Ain't no one wondering when i'm coming home
Ain't nowhere i gotta be
The only heart I'm breaking
Is the broken one inside of me
So take my keys
And pour my drink
But let me be
Cause I ain't hurting nobody but me

There was a time, so many times
I caused her pain
Saw her cry
But I closed my eyes and I wouldn't change
And I became all those things that now I hate
I swore I'd never hurt another
Since the day she left

I ain't huting nobody but me
Ain't no one wondering when I'm coming home
Ain't no where I gotta be
The only heart I'm breaking
Is the broken one inside of me
So take my keys
And pour my drink
But let me be
Cause I ain't hurting nobody but me
I ain't hurting nobody but me---Lyrics submitted by samantha.
