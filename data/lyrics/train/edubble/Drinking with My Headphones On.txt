(Chorus)
The hands go up, but they always come down
Thats the sad truth when you're living for the crowd
The shows been over but you're still on the 'bout
You should really hand it up but you're just too proud!
The beat's too low and the vocals too LOUD!
Even in the booth, we've been having ups and downs
So put you're headphones on and drink till you pass out
Praying for a drought... hope you shake ya dark cloud..---Lyrics submitted by Luke Kaittani.
