Yellow skies, I can see with yellow skies. 
See you again, 
I see you again. 
In my dreams. [X4]

Morning light (ah), I remember morning light (ah). 
Outside my door (outside my door) 
I see you no more (see you no more.) 
In my dreams. [X4]

Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you. 
Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you. 
Responsible. [X4]

Black and white, it's become so black and white. 
So insecure, 
You're so insecure. 
That's what you are.[X4]

Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you. 
Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you. 
Responsible. [X4]

Ah ouh, ah ouh... 

Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you. 
Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you. 
Responsible. [X4]---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
