'm not ready for this 
Though I thought I would be 
I can't see the future 
Though I thought I could see

I don't want to leave you 
Even though I have to 
I don't want to love you 
I still do 

Need some time to find myself 
I wanna live within 

Can I go my own way 
Can I pray my own way 
I don't want to leave you 
I need you 

Am I ready for this 
Did I think I would be 
Can I see the future 
No, I can't see

I'm not ready for this 
Though I thought I would be 
I can't see the future 
Though I thought I could see 

I don't want to leave you 
Even though I have to 
I don't want to love you 
I still do---Lyrics submitted by thamara.
