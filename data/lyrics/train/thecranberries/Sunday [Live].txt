Oh, do you know,
Where to go, where to go?
Something on your mind,
Wanna leave me behind, wanna leave me behind.


You're spinning me around,
My feet are off the ground.
I dunno where I stand.
Do you have to hold my hand?
You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me...


Oh, when he walked into the room,
It happened oh so soon.
I didn't want to know.
Does he really have to go?
You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me...


And I couldn't find the words,
To say, I love you.
And he couldn't find the time,
To say, I need you.
It wouldn't come out right.
It wouldn't come out right.
Just came out all wrong.


You're spinning me around,
My feet are off the ground.
I dunno where I stand.
Do you have to hold my hand?
You mystify me, you mystify me, you mystify me...


Oh, do you know,
Where to go, where to go?
Something on your mind,
Wanna leave me behind, wanna leave me behind.---Lyrics submitted by A_Chuck.
