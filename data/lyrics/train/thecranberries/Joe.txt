Oh, oh oh oh yeah... 

There was a time, I was so lonely, oh hey yeah... 
Remember the time, it was on Friday, oh hey yeah... 
You made me feel fine, we did it my way, oh hey yeah... 
I sat on your knees, every Friday, oh hey yeah... 

We walked in fields of golden hay. 
I still recall you. 
We walked in fields of golden hay. 
I see you in the summer. 

Joe. Joe. 

I sat on your chair, by the fire, oh hey yeah... 
Transfixed in a stare, taking me higher, oh hey yeah... 
Precious years to remember, oh hey yeah... 
Childhood fears, I surrender, oh hey yeah... 

We walked in fields of golden hay. 
I still recall you. 
We walked in fields of golden hay. 
I see you in the summer. 

Joe. Joe. 

Ouh, ouh ouh...---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
