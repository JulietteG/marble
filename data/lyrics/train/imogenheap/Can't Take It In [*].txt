Can't close my eyes
I'm wide awake
Every hair on my body
Has got a thing for this place
Oh, empty my heart
I've got to make room for this feeling
It's so much bigger than me

CHORUS
It couldn't be anymore beautiful
I can't take it in

Weightless in love...unraveling
For all that's to come
And all that's ever been
We're back to the board
With every shade under the sun
Let's make it a good one

CHORUS

It couldn't be anymore beautiful
It couldn't be anymore beautiful
I can't take it in

Laaaaaaaa ohhhhhhh
I can't take it in

Laaaaaaaaa ohhhhhh
I can't take it in
Woahhhhhhh

It couldn't be anymore beautiful
It couldn't be anymore beautiful
I can't take it in

More that I wonder
More than I ever needed
Woahhhhhh
More that I wonder

Oooooohhhhhh---Lyrics submitted by Andy.
