flowers in the ground they wilt away
sun in the sky it fades away
making funnier shapes from clouds so gray
the breeze in the trees they blow my way

i was told my soul was old
why cant i understand at all
if my soul was old was really old
wonder if i could change this world

life has given me obstacles
still i bite my tongue and say its wonderful
im just gald im still around
but im even more glad when things are down

but you, you came to break me
oh you, you came to save me

lifes too short for worries and plans
so let the day take you by the hand
get your file fax well go and burn them
but im too well for a damned man
make a wish on a star at night
the brightest star thats in the sky
only two have realized
that it was just a satellite

but you, you came to call me
oh you, you came to cool me---Lyrics submitted by Angelina.
