You were sitting at the coffee table
where youre reading Kierkegaard
Minutes later, you proceeded to say
something that almost broke my heart

You said, Darling, I am tired of livin my routined life.
Theres so much in the world that id like
to soak up with my eyes.

Well, baby I never did stop you from going out to explore
We can do it all together from the colds of the poles
to the tropics of Borneo

Lets pack our bags
and lie on the easy stream
feel the water on our backs
where we can carry on dreamin
where we can finally
be where wed like to be
Darlin, just you and me
Just you and me


So Darlin, what do you say?
Does that sound like a plan to you?
We can build our own little world
where no one can come through

We can live in huts made out of grass
we can greet father time as he walks pass
we can press feet into the dirt
a little mud, no, it wouldnt hurt

Lets pack our bags
and lie on the easy stream
feel the water on our backs
where we can carry on dreamin
where we can finally
be where wed like to be
Darlin, just you and me
Just you and me..---Lyrics submitted by fara.
