I tried to do the right thing your the only one who knows.
Thunder caught me lightning struck me oh so long ago
you opened up the heavens babe you opened up this rose
I was just a game to you but still it's you I choose.

Cause you give me that wicked love
you give me that wicked love
you give me that wicked love

An avalanche of pain is a funny way to show you care.
But cursed love is worth it.
When I see you lying there
I've given on to hold you one more time before your gone
But you stay out of reach enough to keep at your palm

And you give me that wicked love
you give me that wicked love
you give me that wicked love

Creepin' to the empty bed
The sun won't come and find me
Bathing in your light your presence lingers close behind me
Still it hurts like rock and roll.
Your voice come out the radio
But if you hold a place for me
Then I'll keep taking you in

you give me that wicked love
you give me that wicked love
you give me that wicked love

Wicked love
Wicked love
Wicked love

Wicked love (repeatedly whispered)---Lyrics submitted by sarah rogalski.
