Nobody took down my guard like you
Nobody moved in their toothbrush soo soon
Nobody does whatever they want like you

My cards on the table...
I am spilled milk
Theres no use crying
Theres forces at will
Im yours for the taking
Come get your fillCause

~Chorus:
Nobody loves me like you do
Nobody thrills me like you do
Nobody gets me
Nobody kills me like you
~

Nobody buys me old books like you
Nobody hikes up my skirt like you do
Nobody said that aint changing like you

Im painting a picture
Cause Im seeing red
Youre not the villain
I built in my head
The flowers you picked out
Still sit by the bedCause

~Chorus~

To love you is to go mad
To love you is to lose myself
In meeting you Ive met my match
Theres no sweeter death
No sweeter death than this

~Chorus~
