Yellow diamonds in the light
Now were standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

Its the way Im feeling I just cant deny
But Ive gotta let it go

Shine a light through an open door
Love a life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

Its the way Im feeling I just cant deny
But Ive gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
Now were standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What a chance to come alive---
