Give me just a minute to think out loud
If you have a minute to spare
You hide and seek, and you're running out
It doesn't seem to get you anywhere

You're focus is off, let me rub your eyes
So wake up and make up
The act you're putting on is a cheep disguise
So break out, I'll break you out

Chorus:
All this time you're on the run
Waiting for life to start off
But it's already begun
Oh this race is never won
You know that it can't be done
You might as well be chasing the sun

Tell me how it feels to be on the ground
Now that you've changed your game
You're catching your breath and it's slowing down
But the need to hunt remains

You try to find your way, but you're getting lost
So brake it off, and shake it off
I promis I'll let you readjust
Don't shut me out, don't shut me out

Chorus 2x---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
