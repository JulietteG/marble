You got the flow like a river.
Heading the same way forever.
I love you, love you, love you, love you.
And I'm trying.
To figure out how to make it better.

If you don't hide away inside,
you find your wings would open.
So free your mind, and you will fly.

Baby get higher.
You know it's all I'm asking for.
Baby get higher.
I don't think I can take no more.
You're bringing me down,
you're stuck on the ground.
How do I turn this thing around.
Baby get higher.

You're stuck in the groove like a record.
You don't even know what you're looking for.
And you never, never, never see that I'm trying.
No, I want you to feel so much more.

Let it all out, just scream and shout.
Tear down the walls around you.
So free your mind, and you will fly.

Baby get higher.
You know it's all I'm asking for.
Baby get higher.
I don't think I can take no more.
You're bringing me down,
you're stuck on the ground.
How do I turn this thing around.
Baby get higher.

If you don't hide away inside,
you find your wings will open.
So free your mind, and you will fly.

Baby get higher.
You know it's all I'm asking for.
Baby get higher.
I don't think I can take no more.
You're bringing me down,
you're stuck on the ground.
How do I turn this thing around.
Baby get higher.---Lyrics submitted by chapterman.
