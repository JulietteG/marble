I sleep with my hands across my chest,
And I dream of you with someone else,
I feed my body with things that I don't need,
Until I sink to the bottom,
Don't act like it came as a surprise,
Don't believe me even look into these eyes

This cant go on so I should just,
Regret it, regret it, regret it,
And even though I left you I'll,
Forget it, forget it, forget it

I'm going missing for a while,
I've got nothing left to lose,
Oooh I'll listen to anything

I still remember how you moved,
And I can taste your scent on my lips,
Well how it started I will never know,
But now I've reached my limit

This cant go on so I should just,
Regret it, regret it, regret it,
And even though I left you I'll,
Forget it, forget it, forget it

I'm going missing for a while,
I've got nothing left to lose,
Oooh I'll listen to anything,
I'm going missing for a while,
I've got nothing left to lose,
Oooh I'll listen to anything

Do you ever want to wear your body out,
Until there's nothing left to take,
The one began to push away,
As midnight come to soon again

I'm going missing for a while,
I've got nothing left to lose,
Oooh I'll listen to anything,
I've got nothing in defence,
I've got nothing left to lose,
Oooh I'll listen to anything

I sleep with my hands across my chest,
And I dream of you with someone else---Lyrics submitted by Robert.
