Gold house breaking into piece
I love you singing hallelujah
Earth wont fall but the mountains gonna shape
How we dancing in the waves tonight

Speed lights shootin in the corner
Star by simple little minds
Were falling like birds from the open sky
How we ignore a big fire

You said dont, dont waste your time or mine
Eyes, theyve got broken
Same that holds in tears that hide away oh oh

You said please dont ask me for the last word
The silence starts in full swing
Were listening cause somebody that hurts is somebody worth remembering

(Chorus1)
Oh oh oh oh oh
Us and ours
Oh oh oh oh oh
Its gonna be a bright day someday afternoon
In this whole house you said it

(Chorus2)
Oh oh oh oh oh
Us and ours
Oh oh oh oh oh
Gonna like those eyes and know its all flesh and bone
The sun will set and well all start dreaming

Also the comments that are held on my tongue
Lost along the way
Its hard to lose anything that you never have
Might love the time we make

These days getting something out of your faith
Wrap the words around it
But the true results on the perfect sense and its made to be heard again

You said dont dont count your blessings too much
You make them less in size
And feel until its gone away

You stayed, hold me
But please dont hold too tightly
Still got lots of lines to fill
And holes to fill and a body that hurts is a body worth living for

(Chorus1)
Oh oh oh oh oh
Us and ours
Oh oh oh oh oh
Its gonna be a bright day someday afternoon
In this whole house you said it

(Chorus2)
Oh oh oh oh oh
Us and ours
Oh oh oh oh oh
Gonna like those eyes and know its all flesh and bone
The sun will set and well all start dreaming---Lyrics submitted by Beth Lewis.
