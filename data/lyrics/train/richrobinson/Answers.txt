We all live by
action, direction.
Without ever asking
why should we?

We seek out answers
to these questions.
What are we doing
to make things right?

Long run, right now.
Can we come out?
And stand on our own 
and take the blame?

Right or wrong.
Judgement. Compassion.
When will we realize 
it all turns grey?---Lyrics submitted by Steve Baglio.
