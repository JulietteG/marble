I haven't been to church since
I don't remember when
Things were going great
Til they fell apart again
So I listened to the preacher
As he told me what to do
He said you cant go hating others
who done wrong to you
Sometimes we get angry
We must not condemn
Let the good Lord do his job
And you just pray for them

I pray your brakes go out
Running down a hill
I pray a flower pot falls
From a window sill
And knocks you in the head like I'd like to
I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
I pray your flying high when your engine stalls
I pray all your dreams never come true
Just know wherever you are
Honey, I pray for you

I'm really glad I found my way to church
Cause I'm already feeling better and I thank God for the words
Yeah I'm gonna take the high road
And do what the preacher told me to do
You keep messing up   
And I'll keep praying for you

I pray your tire blows out at 110
I pray you pass out drunk with your best friend
And wake up with his or her tattoo 
(instrumental)

I pray your brakes go out
Running down a hill
I pray a flower pot falls
From a window sill
And knocks you in the head like I'd like to
I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
I pray your flying high when your engine stalls
I pray all your dreams never come true
Just know wherever you are
near or far, in your house or in your car
Wherever you are honey, I pray for you.
I pray for you.---Lyrics submitted by hailey.
