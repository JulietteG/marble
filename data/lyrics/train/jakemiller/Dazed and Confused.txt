Got me feeling like

Look, girl you got me faded
Like I down the whole bottle
Yeah, you walked in the room
Looking like a Victoria Secret model
Throw your number in my iPhone
And then let me take you home
I swear I think I fell in love
Either that or my drink's too strong

Took a walk on the clouds, better sleep on the moon
And I'm not coming down, now that I'm with you
If we ever wake up, don't know what I would do
Are we really in love
Or dazed and confused

Got me feeling like, yeah
You taking selfies with your girls
And dancing with your ass out
The way you drop it down low
I swear you got me bout to pass out
Feeling tipsy, every time you kiss me
Girl you got me high, yeah this love we got is trippy
But it's all good, we just dazed and confused
Wake up in the morning, what the hell do we do?

Took a walk on the clouds, better sleep on the moon
And I'm not coming down, now that I'm with you
If we ever wake up, don't know what I would do
Are we really in love
Or dazed and confused

Got me feeling like, yeah

Alright, here's how it's going down
You, me and your home girl
Can get a little freaky in my hotel
Just don't let me catch you being sneaky with your phone girl
That's a quick way to get dismissed
Now I hope we on the same page
But that's what I love about college chicks
I keep getting older and they stay the same age
Now turn around and let me get a peek
Good lord, that's a miracle
But don't get too geek, feel them sheets
That's not boyfriend material
She's got a body like, mhm
And a face like, yeah
I got one head saying, mhm
And other one saying, yeah

Took a walk on the clouds, better sleep on the moon
And I'm not coming down, now that I'm with you
If we ever wake up, don't know what I would do
Are we really in love
Or dazed and confused

You got me feeling like
Dazed and confused
You got me feeling like---
