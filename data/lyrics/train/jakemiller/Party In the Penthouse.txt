Tonight, we gonna party in the penthouse
Ha ha
Well, alright, alright, alright
Yeah, look

This ain't no ordinary average kinda night, come on
We know that we can't afford to do this twice, no we can't
We only got one chance, so we gotta do this right
Yeah, we living it up, forget about all your plans
You could run and tell all your friends, we gonna party in the penthouse
Reserve a room at the W, panoramic top floor
Everybody's coming through, bathrobe and boxers
Calling room service, ordering some lobster and some cheeseburgers in this bitch
Hotel staff is getting pissed, 'cause they weren't invited to this shit
We gonna dance with the maids, and pretend like we're Bill Gates
Throw this money like we just got paid

We gonna party in the penthouse
We might be flat broke, but for one night feel like we made it
We gonna party in the penthouse
We all wanna know, what it's like one night to be famous
Yeah, we gonna party in the penthouse

Just take the elevator right up to the sky, come on up
We at the top, I hope you're not afraid of heights
We spent this money so we gotta do it right
Yeah, we living it up, forget about all your plans
You could run and tell all your friends, we gonna party in the penthouse
Taking shots at this instrumental on the balcony
Like wassup get on my level, spilling liquor on this California king
Singing money ain't a thing, you can charge it to my incidentals
Woo, I'm on my Gatsby shit
Yeah, pinkies up I'm on my classy shit
Yeah, one time throw your glass in the air
'Cause we started from the lobby now we here

We gonna party in the penthouse
We might be flat broke, but for one night feel like we made it
We gonna party in the penthouse
We all wanna know, what it's like one night to be famous
Yeah, we gonna party in the penthouse

La la la la la
Everybody in the penthouse singing
La la la la la
Yeah, we gonna party in the penthouse
La la la la la
Everybody in the penthouse singing
La la la la la

We gonna party in the penthouse
We might be flat broke, but for one night feel like we made it
We gonna party in the penthouse
We all wanna know, what it's like one night to be famous
Yeah, we gonna party in the penthouse

We might be flat broke, but for one night feel like we made it
We gonna party in the penthouse
We all wanna know, what it's like one night to be famous
Yeah, we gonna party in the penthouse---
