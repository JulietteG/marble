Well it was raining outside
so I cleaned the house today.

spent half of the morning
throwing old things away.

Try not to get caught up
try to think like a machine

focus in on the task try not to
figure out what it means


and I cannot get you
out of my head
lost without you
half-dead


took my spot at the window
looked out at the road.

dots and dashes of traffic
like a messaging code

of whole boxes of memories
wrapped up at the curb,

I sang songs to myself,
didn't have any words.


and I cannot get you
out of my head
lost without you
half-dead


stole out to the backyard
late last night.

pine trees frozen
in the silvery moonlight,

rising like giants
from the cold earth.

what are the years we gave each other
ever gonna be worth?

and I cannot get you
out of my head
lost without you
half-dead---Lyrics submitted by Public.
