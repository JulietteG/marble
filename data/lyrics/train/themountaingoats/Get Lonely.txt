I will rise up early 
and dress myself up nice
And i will leave the house 
and check the deadlock twice.

And i will find a crowd 
and blend in for a minute
And i will try to find 
a little comfort in it.

And i will get lonely 
and gasp for air.
And send your name up from my lips
like a signal flare.

And i will go downtown
stand in the shadows of the buildings
And button up my coat
trying to stay strong, spirit willing.

And i will come back home
maybe call some friends
Maybe paint some pictures
It all depends

And i will get lonely
and gasp for air
And look up at the high windows
and see your face up there.---Lyrics submitted by Public.
