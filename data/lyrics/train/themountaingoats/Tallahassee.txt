Window facing an ill-kept front yard 
Plums on the tree heavy with nectar 
Prayers to summon the destroying angel 
Moon stuttering in the sky like film stuck in a projector 
And you 
You 

Twin prop airplanes passing loudly overhead 
Road to the airport two lanes clear 
Half the whole town gone for the summer 
Terrible silence coming down here 
And you 
You 

There is no deadline 
There is no schedule 
There is no plan we can fall back on 
The road this far can't be retraced 
There is no punch line anybody can tack on 
There are loose ends by the score 
What did I come down here for? 
You 
You---Lyrics submitted by Stacy.
