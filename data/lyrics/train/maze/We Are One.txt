VERSE1:
Cant understand
why we treat each other in this way
Taking up time
with the silly, silly games we play
Weve got our love
and no matter how its said and done

HOOK:
(We are one)	no matter what we do
(We are one)	our love will see us through
(We are one)	and thats the way it is
(We are one)	Ohhh.

VERSE2:
Sometimes I feel
that we try to make each other sad ... I dont know why
Things we do
how we make each other feel so bad
Weve got so much
we could all be having so much fun

HOOK:
(We are one)	right from the very start, WE!
(We are one)	deep down in your heart
(We are one)	and thats the way it is
(We are one)	Ohhh.
