Over and over your love was never less than real
I wanna tell you something I know just how you feel
And oh you tried and you tried and you tried
You wanted me to be your man
It took awhile sweet baby but I think I understand

I can tell by the look in your eyes
That your falling in love with me
I can tell by the look in your eyes

That your what I need your what I need
Your what I yea yea yea yea

And oh you never never told me just what was on your mind
I didn't know you noticed and you knew this all the time
I wasn't playing hard to get I really couldn't see
It doesn't matter baby I've got you here with me

I can tell by the look in your eyes
That your falling in love with me
I can tell by the look in your eyes
That your what I need

I can tell by the look in your eyes
That your falling in love with me
That your falling in love with me
I can tell by the look in your eyes
That your all I need
I can tell I can tell sweet baby
I can tell by that look in your eyes
That look in your eyes

Would you come to me and give it to me
Give it to me give it to me that look in your eyes ---Lyrics submitted by renaye tolliver.
