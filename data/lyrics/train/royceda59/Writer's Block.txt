[Eminem - Intro]
 Yeah, yeah
 I dont know what else to say
 I cant, I cant think of nothin
 Im stumped
 Here we go (Here we go)

On your feet (On your feet)
 Stand up (Stand up)
 Everybody hands up (Hands up)
 Uh, man, I dunno, man
 Everytime I go to think of something played out to say
 You already said it

[Verse 1 - Royce da 59]
 I aint calling names cause all of yall the same, plus
 Im the king, all my past pain all done changed up
 All these plains, all these lames, since the Slaughters came up
 Cause they know they hands tied, feet ball and chained up
 N-ggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
 Because of my relationship with Marshall
 Used to make me a little partial, but heres the brain f-ck
 We the same cuz
 Im probably about to fall out with a young buck
 While I attempt to f-ck the f-cking game up
 Bitch, splat, only thing I fear in here is chit-chat
 You are hearing bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
 Shady guys like the Navy, drive, wavy bye-bye
 Maybe my Glock can turn your top to babys Maybach
 My shit is powerful, literally sick, trust me n-gga
 Its ugly to kill a thing if the bigger I get
 The more disgusting and f-ckin disfigured it gets
 N-ggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop
 Yall about the champagne, Im about the toast
 I, only f-ck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
 N-ggas thatll smoke you while you staring in your postbox
 Only incense he enlightens when hes thinkin
 While that sinks in, I got a Brinks ink pen
 Im back, muthaf-cker
 Notice the flyness on the cover of the XXL
 Im back from the dead like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
 How yall realer? (How yall realer?) If I said it, I did it
 If I didnt, I seen it first-hand like a car dealer
 Give up the throne, your lease up, I am the Mona Lisa
 That decoded Da Vinci Code, you throwin your piece up
 Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup
 N-gga, the mistake was like my only teacher
 Wait til they get a load of me cause

Ive got Guccis on my feet
 Diamonds on my neck
 Diamonds on my wrist
 Bitches on my dick
 But yall already said that

Choppers in the trunk
 Models in the front
 Bottles in the club
 But I dont give a f-ck
 But yall already said that

[Eminem]
 Cause sometimes I feel like its so hard
 For me to come up with shitty to say (Ayyyyyy)
 Im at a loss for words cause yall already said it all
 I think Im runnin out of cliches
 Im gettin writers block
 Psyche!

[Verse 2 - Royce da 5'9'']
 When I stand up in this booth, n-ggas notice it
 Sittin on the same boat that Noah built
 Floatin on the same water Moses split
 Poetry in motion, but we sittin on your grave site, overkill
 Arent you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet!
 Real dudes move in silence like a mute drivin a new hybrid
 You dudes is too excited
 You a dude thatd try to sue a dude thats suicidal
 You will just be another victim
 I am like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie, Im a little twisted
 I roll like the end credits in movies, yall just got scripted
 Got yall n-ggas bitches bobbin to this one when she witcha
 When she wit me, she bobbin, not vibin
 Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
 Im a sperate with a purpose, havin problems?
 Not a problem Ive encountered
 I have found elephants, lions, clowns
 Will jump through hoops like they workin for the circus
 At the fire round the circles right in front of them, fire rounds
 Pun intended, gun extended, what are you marks askin?
 Cars Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past it
 Since I decided to start Class diss
 All black, all glass, panoramic roof been gettin marked absent
 I authorize my own all-access
 Your bitch a whore, Im a catch, she ball-catchin
 Her jaws been broadcasted all across the globe from the store to Japan
 Her p-ssy need to blocked and reported as spam
 Bong! Interscope up in this dope and I sell it
 My voicemail is full, got bitches screamin inside of envelopes
 And they tryna mail em to me, tryna reach my phone
 I dont know which one is harder
 Tryna not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own

[Hook]
 I got Guccis on my feet
 Diamonds on my neck
 Diamonds on my wrist
 Bitches on my dick
 But yall already said that

Choppers in the trunk
 Models in the front
 Bottles in the club
 But I dont give a fuck
 But yall already said that

[Eminem]
 Cause sometimes I feel like its so hard
 For me to come up with shitty to say (Ayyyyyy)
 Im at a loss for words cause yall already said it all
 I think Im runnin out of cliches
 Im gettin writers block
 Psyche!

Man, get the bozac
 We need to start bringin that shit back (Mad flava)
 Man, f-ck it, Im bout to catch some wreck (We in effect, money!)
 Mad props to Royce for keepin it real
 On the strength, no diggity
 Im bout to go pull some hoes, get my mack on

Haters get the gasface!
