NRA, KKK, Adventist-Seventh Day!
Elks and Eagles, Moose and Masons, everything's okay!

If you align yourself, define yourself!
When you don't know who you are, you can remind yourself!
If you align yourself, define yourself!
When you don't know who you are, you can remind yourself!

FFA, PLO, choose your partner, there ya go!
NAMBLA, PeTA, People's Temple-- plant your seed, and grow!
NFL, AFC, think of who you wanna be!
Airhead, Trekkie, Coke, Pepsi, Manson Family!

Align yourself, define yourself!
When you don't know who you are, you can remind yourself!
If you align yourself, define yourself!
When you don't know who you are, you can remind yourself!

Don't be on your own, never be alone--
Don't worry, you will never be alone.
Don't worry, you will never be alone!

Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists,
Bloods, Crips, Teamsters, Nudists, 
Democrat, Republican, Independent-- pick ya one!
John Birch Society, N Double A C P,
Ford, Chevy, Al QAI-EDA all can set you free!

If you align yourself, define yourself!
When you don't know who you are, you can remind yourself!
If you align yourself, define yourself!
When you don't know who you are, you can remind yourself!

If you align yourself, define yourself!
When you don't know who you are, you can remind yourself!
If you align yourself, define yourself!
When you don't know who you are, you can remind yourself!---Lyrics submitted by Nathaniel Gnau.
