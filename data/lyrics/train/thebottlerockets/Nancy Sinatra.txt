Let's go girls!

       Verse 1
She's so fine ya'll
She aint mine ya'll
Her name is Nancy 
And Frankie is her paw

She's the queen
Of my scream
Struts so tight
My mind goes right
To, pure obscene

       Chorus
Swingin sounds of the 60's
Sell 'em on the TV late at night
Wish I had a time machine
She's stone cold outa sight

       Verse 2
She's so cute
Drop all of my loot
Just to see her standing in
Her, Coco Boot

       Chorus

       Lead

       Verse 3
She's so hot-ah
Take all that I got-ah
Just to be in the company
Of Miss Nancy Sinatra

       Chorus
She's stone cold outa sight (3x)

       End---Lyrics submitted by Pat Bolinger.
