It seems like everythin' is happened again
It's the same old story
People keep on getting in my way
I'm tryin' to do this for me

Cause I had a chance in everything
Puttin' all this on me
It's breaking every little piece of me
And I don't ever want you to leave

I'm trying to make it right
This thing that they call love
I need you in my life
I'm trying to make it right

About us
I keep hearin' it
About us
I don't care what they say
About us
I hate hearin' it
About us
I'm tired

About us
I keep hearin' it
About us
I don't care what they say
About us
I hate hearin' it
About us
I'm tired

It feels like I'm in a lose-lose
With this split in direction
Why couldn't it just be a one way
So I can give you affection

Never thought I'd see the day
It's not fast for me to choose
It's not easy to explain
You'd have to walk in my shoes

I'm trying to make it right
This thing that they call love
I need you in my life
I'm trying to make it right

About us
I keep hearin' it
About us
I don't care what they say
About us 
I hate hearin' it
About us
I'm tired

About us
I keep hearin' it
About us
I don't care what they say
About us
I hate hearin' it
About us
I'm tired

I keep tryin' to turn the page
But it's hard for me to do
Choosin' you won't blame the state
Either way I'm gonna lose
Cause you know I wanna
I'll know nothin' at all
You make the call

About us
I keep hearin' it
About us
I don't care what they say
About us
I hate hearin' it
About us
I'm tired

About us
I keep hearin' it
About us
I don't care what they say
About us
I hate hearin' it
About us
I'm tired

About us
I keep hearin' it
About us
I don't care what they say
About us
I hate hearin' it
About us
I'm tired

I'm tired
I'm tired---Lyrics submitted by Rosa.
