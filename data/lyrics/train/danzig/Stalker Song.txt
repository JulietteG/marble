No one knows my name
Where I come from
No one sees my face
Sees me coming
You can never hide
If I want you
You can't even try
Keep from crying

Oh!
I wish you could
I'm coming in your home
I wish you could
I'm coming in your hole

No one sees my face
Sees my pain
No one can see my shape
In the shadows
You can feel the dark
When in stalking
I can step right in whenever I want you

I'm coming in your home
I wish you could
I'm coming in your hole
I wish you would
I'm coming in your home
I wish you could
I'm coming in your hole
I wish you would---Lyrics submitted by will.
