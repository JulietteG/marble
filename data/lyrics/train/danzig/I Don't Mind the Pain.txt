Remember to call my name I adore it
If you speak my name I implore it
If with all these things we invoke here
Call you out are name but be forewarned dear

I don't mind the pain
I don't mind the pain

We hear you call our name we adore it
Hear you all these things that we invoke here
If you call our name rest assure it
See you all these things but be forewarned dear

I don't mind the pain
I don't mind the pain
And I stay so arcane
In the shadows of your brain
Will I come to you again
Remember that I don't mind the pain

Hear you call our name
Can you afford it
Racked with all these things and beyond hope dear
Remember to call our name and we assure you
Trip with all these things that we invoke here

I don't mind the pain
I don't mind the pain
And I stay so arcane
In the shadows of your brain
Will I come to you again
Remember that I don't mind the pain---Lyrics submitted by will.
