Mother 
Tell your children not to walk my way 
Tell your children not to hear my words 
What they mean 
What they say 
Mother 

Mother 
Can you keep them in the dark for life 
Can you hide them from the waiting world 
Oh mother 

Father 
Gonna take you daughter out tonight 
Gonna show her my world 
Oh father 

Not about to see your light 
But if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's like 
Till you're bleeding 

Not about to see your light 
And if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's 

Mother 
Tell your children not to hold my hand 
Tell your children not to understand 
Oh mother 

Father 
Do you wanna bang heads with me 
Do you wanna feel everything 
Oh father 

Not about to see your light 
And if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's like 
Till you're bleeding 

Not about to see your light 
And if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's 
Yea 

Not about to see your light 
But if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's like 
Till you're bleeding 

Not about to see your light 
And if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's like 
Wo-oh 
Mother 
Yea---
