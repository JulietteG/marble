Well interstate eighty we was cuttin' the fog
Just me an' old Sloan, Old Sloan's my dog
We had an eighteen wheeler with a ten on the floor an' a stereo, layin' a strip
Then we spied a sign says eat'n gas now
We decided to whip in an' pick up some chow
At the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin' Caf

Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin'
Oh the Old Home Filler-up - A lookin' for Mavis
The Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin Caf

Now we been every place between here an' South Sioux
An' we've seen us a truck stop waitress or two
But this gal's built like a burlap bag full of wildcats, she's got it together
Well she filled my tank, I says thank you honey
Her name is Mavis, I gave her the money
Old Sloan just set there a watchin' an' waggin' an whooshin'

I says you wait in the truck boy

Well we went inside, she said "what'll it be"
I says a cup of yer best and a number three
She come back with an order to go, an' a quart of hot C, and a bone for Sloan
I said much obliged, old Sloan give a bark
I left her a buck, an' he left his heart
At the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin' Caf

Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin'
Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin'
Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin' Caf

Well Saturday night an' we was truckin' along
Yeah me an' old Sloan was a getting' it on
I said Sloan, I been a thinkin' on-a getting' up my courage and tonight's the night
Well I popped the clutch, gave the tranny a spin
Took the Beebetown ramp, and slid on in
To the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin' Caf

Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin'
Oh the Old Home Filler-up - It never closes
Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin' Caf

Well I got me a stool, took a load off my shoes
Made Mavis an offer that she couldn't refuse
I says how'd ya like to go for a ride with me an' old Sloan, I just had my truck warshed
She allowed as how it sounded like a whole lotta fun
But we was gonna have to wait until the dishes was done
And was it all right with me if she brought along her mother as a chaperone

I said why not...

Well we geared that tranny into super low
And the four of us went to see a picture show
Yeah I took 'em to the drive in theater over by Pisgah, to see True Grit
Saw the late late show, old Sloan hit the sack
And then along about two o'clock I hauled 'em on back
To the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin' Caf

Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin'
Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin'
Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin' Caf

Eight stools an' a promise...

Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin'
Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin'
Oh the Old Home Filler-up an' Keep On a-Truckin' Caf

They got 'em a real nice place there ---Lyrics submitted by David Rhoads.
