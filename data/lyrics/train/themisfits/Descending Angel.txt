torn from the heavens
they fall from the sky
and walk the streets among 
mortal men
they hide in shadows
keepers of the night
mortal life is weak 
can't hold back the demons 
the blood pours as rain 
and soon you'll be alone. 

whaaoo 
descending angel 
stand by my side 
whaaoo 
we'll face the night 
descending angel 
whaaoo
who guard the gates of hell
just one more night 
whaaoo
for in the morning
will bring the light

born or created in the image 
of a god the heavens fall 
no savior has been sent 
no one to guide us 
alone we face the night 
mortal life is brief 
for the rebel angels 
they make their final stand 
and soon you'll be alone 

whaaoo
descending angel 
stand by my side 
whaaoo 
and face the night 
descending angel 
whaaoo 
who guard the gates of hell 
just one more night 
whaooo 
forever...ends...tonight 
descending angel
