I wont blame the hurting on you
you left in the sweetest way
I won't say that it's you
Making me feel this way
Its the heart and the soul and the body and the brain
Driving me insane but the wind and the land
And the fire and the rain always stay the same
Ayayaj
While I roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
Ayayaj wohoow Ayayaj
While I sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
Ayayaj Ayayaj
I won't claim it's all cause of you
I guess that I played a part
Its just that I never knew
I'd fall for you from the start
Theres a hole in my heart and a picture in a frame
Driving me insane
But the wind and the land and the fire and the rain
Always stay the same
Ayayaj
While I roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
Ayayaj wohoow Ayayaj
While I sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
Ayayaj Ayayaj
I would never blame you for the heartache 
I would never blame you for the tears
I blame my stubborn heart, soul, body
Every single thing around me stays the same
No matter what
Ayayaj
While I roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
Ayayaj wohoow Ayayaj
While I sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
Ayayaj Ayayaj Ayayaj
While I roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
Ayayaj wohoow Ayayaj
While I sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
Ayayaj Ayayaj---Lyrics submitted by Joakim.
