years ago, when i was younger
i kinda liked, a girl i knew
she was mine and we were sweethearts
that was then, but then its true

[chorus]:
i'm in love with a fairytale
even though it hurts
'cause i don't car if i lose my mind
i'm already cursed

every day we started fighting
evry night we fell in love
no one else could make me sadder
but no one else could lift me high above

i don't know wat i was doing
when suddenly we fell apart
nowadys i cannot find her
but when i do, we'll get a brand new start

[chorus]

she's a fairytale yeah
even though it hurts
'cause i don't care if i lose my mind
i'm already cursed---Lyrics submitted by Red.
