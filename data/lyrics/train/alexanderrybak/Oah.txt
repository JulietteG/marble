I love you Moa
Youre way to young for me
But I dont mind

Never mind what your girlfriends say
Deep inside Im quite okay
I may have fooled around once or twice
But I really need you
Its not like Im the only guy
O I know how you make them cry
So lets start by being friends
And let this friendship never end

I knew you years ago
What I want
Is I dont know
But lets just take it slow

Singing Oah
I love you Moa
Youre way to young for me
But I dont mind
Dont say maybe
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
Cuz youll be mine

So tell me what I want to hear
No way that you slided there
You know Im not good for you
God I dont now what to do

I liked you from the start
You have my icey heart
And now its burning up

I love you Moa
Youre way to young for me
But I dont mind

Never mind what your girlfriends say
Deep inside Im quite okay
I may have fooled around once or twice
But I really need you
Its not like Im the only guy
O I know how you make them cry
So lets start by being friends
And let this friendship never end

I knew you years ago
What I want
Is I dont know
But lets just take it slow

Singing Oah
I love you Moa
Youre way to young for me
But I dont mind
Dont say maybe
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
Cuz youll be mine

So tell me what I want to hear
No way that you slided there
You know Im not good for you
God I dont now what to do

I liked you from the start
You have my icey heart
And now its burning up

Chorus:...

Dont go away
No one is left to me
I was reliefd that you would save my soul
But if you slow me down
Crying secretly
Will you hold my hand and never let it gooooo?

Im singing Oah
Cuz I love you Moah
Youre way to young for me
But I dont mind
Dont say may be
Just be my lady
No need to hesitate
Cuz youll be fine ---Lyrics submitted by Tori.
