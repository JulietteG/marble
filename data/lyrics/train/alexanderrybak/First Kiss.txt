Deep in your heart
 There's a small hidden room
 And you know that I hold the key
 You're gonna travell all over the world
 Places where I'll never be

 Someday you'll marry the man of your dreams
 And I will be crying all night
 But there is a secret that both of us know
 That's why I'm feeling alright
 Yes, there is a secret that both of us know
 And that's why I'm feeling alright

 And there'll be
 Smart guys and tall guys - whose stronger than me
 Ten times the charmer than I'll ever be
 But one thing, Maria, I sure didn't miss
 Our very first kiss

 Need I say more?
 The feeling is pure
 And I felt the warmth of your lips
 Though the time will go on
 And the seasons will change
 I'll allways think back on our kiss

 Someday the runway will carry you home
 And I will be smiling all night
 Cause there is a secret that both of us know
 And that's why I'm feeling alright
 Yes, there is a secret that both of us know
 But secrets belong in the night

 There may be
 Shy girls and short girls - whose richer than you
 Ten times the lady and one of a few
 But one thing, Maria, you sure didn't miss
 My very first kiss

 Deep in my mind there's confusion and hope
 And I know that you stole my thoughts
 I gonna travell all over the world
 Searching for someone to hold

 Those say it's over
 When I'm underneath
 Let's see if our feelings unite
 Oh, there is a secret that both of us know
 And that's why we're smiling tonight
 Yes, there is a secret that both of us know
 That's why we're smiling tonight

 There may be
 Someone who truly believes love is blind
 But I beg to differ there's two of a kind
 They will find each other
 And that is real bliss
 Our very first kiss---Lyrics submitted by Esfandyar Zand.
