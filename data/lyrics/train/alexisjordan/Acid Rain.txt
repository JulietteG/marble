[J. Cole]
It aint hard to tell, I excel and prevail
Young niggas rising hell but talk well
Make sales, I managed to re-fake jail
Blast on the road to success was [?]
But here we are, breathing, fuck demons
Never get caught sleeping, Id rather be caught dreaming
Now me and my niggas be flying across seas
Laughing at the days we used to rack tall Ts
Now we rock shows up in London, wondering
How they even heard of me
Never did occur to me if I get to the top one day
Lotta niggas gonna be sending shots my way
Couldve been the worst that I shot then say
Across the bear hoes you never got complain
One day, though, some day is on
One day youre here, next day youre gone

Wake up with the fear of living for another day
Tell myself that its nothing that I cant take
Your strength is the sickness I cant hide
I try to be invisible to him
Make no noise, tip toe through everything
Hells fury feeds the fear inside

Its like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
Its a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover

I made choices that I cannot live with
I regret not choosing over him
Im suffocating in this life
Dont know if I can survive this weather
And you turn up with your arms and umbrella
I send a farewell tonight

Its like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
Its a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover

[J. Cole]
My life could be a movie let me write the script
It would be something truly never read like a crypt
[?] with clothes full of hoes like a pimp
Far from a flower but I rose like a blimp
Now who we gonna cast for the roles in this flick?
Only bad hoes getting shows for the tricks
Who gonna play the lead, though? Will Smith? Maybe
Second thought, fuck it, aint nobody gonna play me
Yo, some day is on, one day youre here, next day youre gone
One day youre here, next day youre gone

I know the risk has come, I know I can run into your arms
I know youll come to save me from harm
Its like acid rain in a hurricane
Might hear your call to bring you cover
Its a crown of thorns leaving me torn
Might hear your call to bring you cover---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
