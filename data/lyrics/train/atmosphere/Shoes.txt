would you prefer if I removed my ahhh
my shoes are clean girl how bout yours
here we are sitting on your living room floor
listen to some records from you collection
boredom between a coma and an erection
staring at the skin on your shoulder blades you take your eyes of my poker face
Im wasted and youre a sober as a Jehovah knocking door to door trying to walk the road that the Mormons paved
shes was here on your sofa with a beer on the coaster
shed a told ya that my game is way over played
make no mistakes I love the way you taste like yogurt and some clover cigarettes girl show my leg
so Im gonna go and trade these shoes for roller-skates 
and Im gonna stay happy just as long as there is a whore to pay
some of us already spent the rent so we cant be content until there isnt no more today
those are you shoes, these are my shoes weve got issues
those are you shoes, these are my shoes weve got issues
my shoes are muddy girl how bout your
here we are lounging on your bedroom floor
Im really drunk so Im looking at the your carpet like man fuck the permit Im know where Im gonna park tonight
its closing time the spins are gonna visit me
they rolling thick like they know they taking victory
but not tonight right Im gonna make some history, get up in your system and direct it like a symphony
let me get to be the man of your mystery
cuz those medaling kids dont understand your sensitivity
show some sympathy let me kiss your feet
lets talk about a pretty bird and a busy bee
if I live to be 50 imma be a tipsy dirty old man still following my kid beliefs
I know it really isnt your responsibility but will be straight after I take this hit of Listerine
those are you shoes, these are my shoes weve got issues
those are you shoes, these are my shoes weve got issues
I cant find my shoes girl how about yours
here I am naked on your bathroom floor
I got faded and you feel asleep and Im thanking god that this date was hella cheap
sittin down tryin to keep the liquor down lights stars sounds everything flickers now
sick bound the whole room twist around in front of the toilet assume the position to drown
here it comes whiskey outbound its all over the floor and Im sitting in the pitchers mound
Im just a clown Im sorry I found it funny when you tripped over my shoes and hit the ground 
I didnt know you would rip your gown
didnt think you would shout gets so loud get so wound
yeh Im drunk but Im more than a little proud 
Im leavin fuck the shoes you keep em Im gettin out
those are you shoes, these are my shoes weve got issues
those are you shoes, these are my shoes weve got issues
perfection
perfection
perfection
