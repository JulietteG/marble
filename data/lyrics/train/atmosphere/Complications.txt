Yo, This is dedicated,
To this girl that I dated.
Complicated maze, complicated maze.
At first sight, only a stranger to my eyes.
Couldn't keep them off
I'm sure your friend recognized
 I didn't care
I had to stare
Stood there at attention
Not many words mentioned
Still i felt the fuck connection
Wanted the sex then
Got to know you wanted more.
Things got complex when you had a man that wasn't sure.
My thoughts were pure,
Is it gonna be him?
Or is it gonna be me?
Cuz that's way I have to have it.

Grasp the idea 
Miss scribble head to Leo.
Wanted you to feature
But your man is screwin up the procedure
What is it that you say, 
I'm on your mind all day
But still say a contempt, 
How the situation lay.
Why you play?
Why do you stay?
There somethin better?
No you felt it when you received my first poetic letter.
Why you frontin?
Tell me somethin,
Is it that you want your cake
& stuff it down our face to?
Did i have to chase you?
Why, oh why, do you cry?
Instead afraid of losin me
I think that your confusin me a lie.
No wait a minute, stop.
Bring that back i missed a page.
Was it that time of the month, 
Or were you goin through a faze.
         (Chorus)
  Complicated Maze
This rage bitch is perfect.
come back in later days
Talk to me when you're certain.
Your always changin up,
Never stay the same person. 
Come back in later days,
Talk to me when your certain.
  Complicated Maze 
This rage bitch is perfect
Come back in later days
Talk to when your certain
Your always changin up,
Never stay the same person.
Come back in later days,
 Talk to me when your..

Miss Mary Weather
The partial,
The martial art is a fake imitation.
Love Chronics
Not facin you is a irritation
When you used 
To have me be placin you
On peddle stools like a Goddess
Personality changes seem to be to me you were the oddest.
Soon to depart us like Red Seas by Moses.
Our friendship disease
Unviesible, hopeless.
No reasonable answer to my question of focus
Cause my tension
Nothing made sense when you replied 
With a tied tongue
Said you've been abusiveness ,
I never swung.
Why all of these excuses Miss,
What have i done?
Figure i had the right kind of lady,
Yeah maybe it was fun...
For you.
But not for me,
 I found it quite unamusing.
You were using me as a grid.
Its the past
What was left behind
Play time for danger is mine.
So why'd it have to be mine,
Why'd it have to be mine.

Now i'm not really tryin to come off abrasive.
But why you messin with my man's head?
I mean i'm spendin time
Tryin to keep his mind on Rhymes & Beats
And you're a distraction 
I mean honestly what i guess i'm tryin to say is.

(Chorus)
(2x)
Virgin torn from sleep
The newborn & it was easy to get to deep.
The water was to warm.

Do you know what today is?
Its the 3rd anniversary,
You came back to flirt with me.
For certain,
You must mistake me for a fool
See i know how you are.
I see those tricks in you.
Try to make amends,
There's somethin new.
Had problems with your friends.
So it's me you always run to.
Come to & smell the coffee,
He'll drink the pot with extra caffeine.
Cuz next to acting,
You win awards for cloudy vision.
Tie the vision  for the what, why & when?
Will this repetition end.
Step away & give me oxygen.
Not interested in talkin. 
Say nothin, keep walkin. 
Go bout your way
See the colors of these barriers started turning gray.
See you later, goodnight.
Got no more candles to light.
Yo it's time to move along cuz baby somethin isn't right.
Still I'm glad i met you,
It's to bad you screwed it up.
Only thing that i regret is that i didn't get to F*#@.

(Chorus)


Aftermath-
(3x)
I was blind 
Now i see---Lyrics submitted by joesph.
