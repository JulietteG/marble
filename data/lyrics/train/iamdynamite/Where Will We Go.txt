She asked me what my name was
I said "I've got no name"
And though she knew the answer
She asked me once again
I said "I've got no question"
Under the bright blue sky
I know that I could tell you
Something and not tell you why

Where will we go
I've got no bright idea
I've got no bright idea
Where we go, this time
Where will we go
I've got no bright idea
Where we go, I don't know
Til the last good time

And all my friends, they come to me
They said "You're gonna die, boy, better believe it"
I said "Son, it's just like this,
Take your time and when you get there"
Grab that vi and grab the matches
People on the loose and they never catch us
I'm gonna tell them just like this,
"Take their time and when they get there"

Where will we go
I've got no bright idea
I've got no bright idea
Where we go this time
Where will we go
I've got no bright idea
Where we go, I don't know
To the last good time

And all my friends, they come to me
They said "You're gonna die, boy, better believe it"
I said "Son, it's just like this,
Take your time and when you get there"
Grab that vi and grab the matches
People on the loose and they never catch us
I'm gonna tell them just like this,
"Take their time and when they get there"

Wayay, I don't mind
Ayay, I don't mind
Ayay, I don't mind
Ayay, I don't mind
Woah x16

Where will we go
I've got no bright idea
I've got no bright idea
Where we go this time
Where will we go
I've got no bright idea
Where we go, I don't know
Til the last good time

And all my friends, they come to me
They said "You're gonna die, boy, better believe it"
I said "Son, it's just like this,
Take their time and when they get there"
She asked me what my name was
I said "I've got no name"
And though she knew the answer
She asked me once again, and
Wayay, I don't mind
Ayay, I don't mind
Ayay, I don't mind
Ayay, I don't mind---Lyrics submitted by Steven Liao.
