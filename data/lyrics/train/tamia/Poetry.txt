He said, It's like the grass that grows between the cracks of ghetto streets, relentless inspite of the neverlasting, I
said baby damn you got lyrics, make it like poetry!

[Verse]
The thugged out pimped out images release them save those roles for the young souls who believe them I want the
undefinable, indescribable and more, but yet so clear when you walk through that door, I said I want it hard, mystical,
tender and correct without expectations but all of that met. Take me around the world, but please come direct and speak to
me, speak to my heart

[Chorus]
Make it like poetry, make it like poetry, poetry, poetry, give your flow slow to me give it all night 
Make it like poetry, poetry, poetry, everything wrong you see make it alright, make it like

[Verse]
Kisses of raindrops wash away the pain, each stroke is a journey on a long train to a new destination, new meditation in
love realization of possibilities he says to me I've given hard, mystical, tender and correct, without expectations yet all
of them met, take me around the world, but please come direct and speak to me, speak to my heart.

[Repeat Chorus]
Make it like
To be or not to be won't be any question
Make it like
The sling of arrows of outrageous love are gone
Make it like
A dream I can touch, a dream I can feel.
Make it like
Only you, only you can take me there
Make it like
Poetry, Poetry, Poetry

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
