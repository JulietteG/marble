Morning light, silk and dreams, take flight
As the darkness gives way to the dawn
You survived, now your moment has arrived
Now your dream has finally been born

Black butterfly
Sail across the waters
Tell your sons and daughters
What the struggle brings
Black butterfly
Set the skies on fire
Rise up even higher
So the ages of the tides can catch your wings

While you slept, the promise was unkept
But your faith was at shore, as the stars
Now you're free, and the world has come to see
Just how proud, and beautiful you are

Black butterfly
Sail across the waters
Tell your sons and daughters
What the struggle brings
Black butterfly
Set the skies on fire
Rise up even higher
So the ages of the tides

Let this current lift your heart and send it soaring
Ride the timeless message clear across the sky
So all of us can read it and remembering who made it
That a dream conceived in truth can never die, can never die

Black butterfly
Sail across the waters
Tell your sons and daughters
What the struggle brings
Black butterfly
Set the skies on fire
Rise up even higher
So the ages of the tides can get your wings
So the world can see how beautiful you are---
