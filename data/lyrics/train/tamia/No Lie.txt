You've been workin hard, baby
It's been keepin us apart lately
I told you from the start I'd hold you down
Ooohh

Cuz when our bodies get together (ooh, yeah)
Anything for your pleasure (oh, yeah)
Cuz no one does it better (oh)
Than me, tell me what you need

Oh you know I don't mind
Givin you all I got
Cuz baby boy you're mine
My love, my life
The only thing that matters is you and I
See you don't have to question my heart
I been lovin you for all time
Noooo lie

Ohhh

I wanna let you know right now
I'm givin you a show lights out
Watch me put it down all through the night
Ohhh

Cuz when our bodies get together (ooh, yeah)
I'm down to do whatever (oh, yeah)
Cuz no one does it better (oh)
Than me, tell me what you need

Oh you know I don't mind

The only thing that matters is you and I

Cuz my only plan tonight
Is to show how much I miss you

No lie, you know you can't deny
A love like this you know is hard to find
