can u tell me how can one miss what she never had
how could i reminise when there is no past
how could i have memories of being happy
with u boy can some one tell me how can this be!?!?how can we see whats infront of use and never realize that love was even there
how could my mind pull up incidents
recall dates and times that never happened
how could we celebrate a love that to late
and how could i really mean the words im bout' to saaay?

i miss the times that we almost shared
i miss the love that was almost there
i miss the times that we use to kiss
at least in my dreams just let take my time and reminise
i miss the times that we never had 
what happen to us we were almost there 
who ever said its impossible to miss what you never had
never almost had youuu

i can not believe i let you go
or what i should say is i should've grabbed you up and never let u go
i should've went out with you i should've made you my boo boy
yeah thats 1 time i should've broke the rules

i should've went on a date 
should've found a way 2 escape
should've turned it almost into if it happened now its to late
how could i celebrate a love that wasn't real
and if it didn't happen why does my heart feeel

i miss the times that we almost shared 
i miss the love that was almost there
i miss the times that we use to kisss 
at least in my dreams just let me take my time and reminise
i miss the time that times that we never had
what happen to us we were almost there 
who ever said its inpossible to miss what you never had 
never almost had youuuu

and you seem to be the perfect one for me youuuuu 
your all i ever wanted 
your my everything yes its true boy its hard to be close to u
my love i no it may sound crazy but im in love with youuuu

i miss the times that we almost shared 
i miss the love that was almost there(almost there)
i miss the times that we used to kisss
at least in my dreams just let me take my time and reminise
i miss the times that we never had
what happen to us we were almost there
who ever said its impossible to miss what you never had
never almost had youuuu 
(chorus 2x)
