Spend the night here
That's what I'm talking about boy
I'm just saying
And I ain't playing
It ain't like that with me when we be layin'
Let me love you
You're looking tired of these basic lovers
When I know the subtle
You got the highest you don't got to settle

See I'm the type of the girl
To kill to love you down
Like you can be the king
And I'll bring you the crown
Like shimmy shimmy coco puff
Shimmy shimmy flower
Me and you on the ground
Baby now

If you wanna ride these curves
Hop on this Chevvy nova
And if you gonna drive with nerve
Baby I'm gon' be your chauffeur
See I can make you feel good love
And when it's all over
I'mma fluff your pillow baby
Bring you a sandwich and a soda

See I'm the type of the girl
To kill to love you down
Like you can be the king
And I'll bring you the crown
Like shimmy shimmy coco puff
Shimmy shimmy flower
Me and you on the ground
Baby now

If you wanna ride these curves
Hop on this Chevvy nova
And if you gonna drive with nerve
Baby I'm gon' be your chauffeur
See I can make you feel good love
And when it's all over
I'mma fluff your pillow baby
Bring you a sandwich and a soda

Oh-oh-oh...
Yeah

Cause if you wanna ride these curves
Hop on this Chevvy nova
And if you gonna drive with nerve
Baby I'm gon' be your chauffeur
See I can make you feel good love
And when it's all over
I'mma fluff your pillow baby
Bring you a sandwich and a soda---
