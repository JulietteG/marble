We were younger than ever
Sitting in the back of a corvette
And all I remember
Was lying naked in a summer sweat

And I was falling in love
While you where fighting the weekend
We were on top of the world
But you don't come around here anymore

Whenever I look back now
Forever nineteen somehow
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
I still think about you
I wish I couldn't drive you home
Listening to Thunder Road
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
I still think about you
Hey where did you go?

We were younger than ever
Doing 110 on the boulevard
Swore we'd never surrender
We found faith in a stolen car

And I was falling in love
While you where fighting the weekend
We were on top of the world
But you don't come around here anymore

Whenever I look back now
Forever nineteen somehow
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
I still think about you
I wish I couldn't drive you home
Listening to Thunder Road
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
I still think about you
Hey where did you go?

(Go, go, go-go)
Go (go, go, go)
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
Put on my jean jacket
Hey where did you go?
(Go, go, go-go)
Go (go, go, go)
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
Put on my jean jacket
Hey where did you go?

And I was falling in love
While you where fighting the weekend
We were on top of the world
But you don't come around here anymore

Whenever I look back now
Forever nineteen somehow
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
I still think about you
I wish I couldn't drive you home
Listening to Thunder Road
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
I still think about you
Hey where did you go?

(Go, go, go-go)
Go (go, go, go)
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
(I still think about you)
Put on my jean jacket
Hey where did you go?
(Go, go, go-go)
Go (go, go, go)
(I still think about you)
Cause when I put on my jean jacket
Put on my jean jacket
Hey where did you go?---
