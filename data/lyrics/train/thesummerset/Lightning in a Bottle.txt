Out in the wild
Party in nowhere land
We start a fire
Sparklers in every hand
No phones let go
Cut all the strings tonight
Singin' aloud
Howlin' right at the moon
We're making out
Life's never felt so good
Bring on the storm
We're wilin' out tonight

Then you lost your shoes as it started to rain
And your jeans soaked through
But you smiled anyway
Throw our hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air

We're catching lightning in a bottle
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
Yeah we're dancing in the backseat
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Yeah we're rolling with the thunder
Now take a breath, we're going under
We're getting busy on the backstreets
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow

Back of the car
Blankets and me and you
We're running on perfectly wasted youth
I'll hold you close
We'll call this home tonight

And the fake tattoo that you drew on my arm
Had an X and an O
Never change who you are
Throw our hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air

We're catching lightning in a bottle
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
Yeah we're dancing in the backseat
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Yeah we're rolling with the thunder
Now take a breath, we're going under
We're getting busy on the backstreets
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Here in the afterglow

Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Throw our hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air

We're catching lightning in a bottle
Don't give a fuck about tomorrow
Yeah we're dancing in the backseat
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Yeah we're rolling with the thunder
Now take a breath, we're going under
We're getting busy on the backstreets
We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Here in the afterglow
Here in the afterglow

Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Here in the afterglow
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Hearts in the air
Here in the afterglow---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth Rodge.
