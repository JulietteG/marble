she's a city girl
flashes lead her down on the runway
stares at the sun
looks down on everyone
and keeps rockin her new shades (her new shades)

i'm a city boy
livin in the shadows of Times Square
prayin to go somewhere
and everyday i turn to cold and rock my shades

and i
will make it through this night alive (alive)
can you find me
in the midst of the crowd
and do you dream of me
when the lights go down
and do you breathe me
in the smoke from your cigarettes
do you feel me with every breath

she's my high school sweatheart
she keeps her red lipstick on
and every morning she wakes up
puts on her makeup
and sings my songs

and i
will make it through this night alive (alive)
can you find me
in the midst of the crowd
and do you dream of me
when the lights go down
and do you breathe me
in the smoke from your cigarettes
do you feel me with every breath

i'm an old school popstar
shakin up her not new angles
bent up by angels
can't catch my breath to speak
can't keep my monsters out of me

and i
will make it through this night alive (alive)
can you find me
in the midst of the crowd
and do you dream of me
when the lights go down
and do you breathe me
in the smoke from your cigarettes
do you feel me with every breath

can you find me
in the midst of the crowd
do you dream of me
when the lights go down
and do you breathe me
in the smoke from your cigarettes
do you feel me with every breath---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
