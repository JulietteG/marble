[Verse One:]
24, 34, 46, good and thick, and once you get it she'll work wit it.
Pretty face and some cute lips, earing in her tongue and she know what to do wit it.
Make a name for herself, and she do her shit well, and know how to keep her business to herself.
Come over anytime a nigga call chick, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, (ding dong) and she right there.
And she know why she came here, and she know where her clothes suppose to be (off and over there).
Sniff a little coke, take a little x, smoke a little weed, drink a little bit.
I need a girl that I can freak wit,
and wanna try shit, and ain't scared of a big dick.
And love to get her pussy licked,
by another bitch, cus I ain't drunk enough to do that.

[Chorus:]
FREAKALEEK!

[Verse Two:]
I need to know a whole lot then to teachin' a broad, with my ding dong make her tongue tickin the bong.
Go on ahead so I dont have to do that far, I'm spoiled (and I don't like to work that hard).
I like to lay back, relax, and enjoy my time, and let your eyes roll back and my toes curl.
(I love when you do that girl) Until it comes time for me to have to give her hers.
Tell me what you want, do you want it missionary with your feet cramed into the head board?
Do you want it from the back with your face in the pillow so you can
yell it loud as you want to?
Do you want it on the floor? Do you want it on the chair?
Do you want it over here? Do you want it over there?
Do you want it in ya pussy? Do you want it in ya ass?
I'll give you anything you can handle!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Caller:]
Yeah, I appreciate it lil' home boy.

[Petey Pablo:]
Not a problem. You know I do it because I love you.
Now I got to give a shoutout to Seagrim Gin cus I drink it, and they
paying me for it.
