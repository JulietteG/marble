You've been hangin' on the phone tryin' to reach me
You can't leave it alone now woman can't you see
You can turn this boy on you got to change your ways
And I told you before you got to stop hangin' around my place

Oh no

[Chorus]
You better go your own way 
You've got to stop wasting my time
I don't want to explain
Why it's like this but you got to know
Your love is in vain
Don't ask me to explain
Your love is in vain
Don't want to say it again

Oh no no no no
I've got to tell ya

I have burned your letters cause
Don't want to know what you write
And I won't answer the phone
Cause I know it's you on that line

Oh no

[Chorus]

Come on

[Solo]

Your love is in vain
Don't ask me to explain
Your love is in vain
Don't want to say it again

Your love is in vain
Ohhhhhh get off my back
Your love love love is in vain
Your love love love is in vain---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
