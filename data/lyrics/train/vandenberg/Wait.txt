Alright you win
I'll pack my bags and go
Alright no fight
I wont put on a show
You say, you love me
That you gave me everything
But I say you lie 
'Cause I know where you've been 

Wait, wait, wait, 'til the shit hits the fan.
Wait, wait, wait, 'til there ain't no much left. 

You've been messing around with every guy in town.
And you think you're great. 
But what do they say when you're gone. 

Wait, wait, wait, 'til the shit hits the fan.
Wait, wait, wait, 'til there ain't no much left. 

C'mon, like this. 
Let everyone get your name! 

Wait, wait, wait, 'til the shit hits the fan.
Wait, wait, wait, 'til there ain't no much left. 

You've got to take it! 
C'mon, you've got to move on!
