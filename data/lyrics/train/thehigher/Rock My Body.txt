Go, Do what we know, dont go
You move we dont---now go
Now dont you move we wont go now dont go go
I like the way that you move meant the way that she tasted
Like to rip these things right through her lips
Contemplating experience that left me here
This intoxicating kiss
But tonight, Im setting all my memories aside

So why dont we trace the footsteps back into our past with the ones weve lost?
Too many bad mistakes were made
No one should have to take the fall for it when its our life to live

Go, Do what we know, dont go
You move we dont---now go
Now dont you move we wont go now dont go go
I like the way that he moved found out the way that he tasted
Then he ripped these things right from her lips
Never thinking the first time that they met would be the last she saw of him

Is clever an issue, a balancing reason
Are we all waiting to destroy?
The things in life we are made of a blessing were tasting
Weve come so far to recreate
Wed like to build the expansion resembling patterns
Disguising everything and what we have to relive
And this all for this one dance

So why dont we trace the footsteps back into our past, with the ones weve lost?
Too many bad mistakes were made
No one should have to take the fall for it when its our life to live

I am watching over you from the stars
Dont be scared I know exactly where you are
Cause theres a piece of me and its burning in your heart
Even that could never tear us apart---Lyrics submitted by S.
