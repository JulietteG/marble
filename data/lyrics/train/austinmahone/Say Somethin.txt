I see you walk by, extra fly baby where you going can I roll?
(Is it cool if I come with you baby?)
Living beach life, feeling right 
You're the hottest everybody knows
Burnin' up burnin' up show em' what you got

Yeah you got it baby let it show
Turn it up, turn it up
Let me know whats up
Don't just stand there girl I gotta know

Say somethin' if your feeling the vibe
Say somethin' baby don't be so shy
Say somethin' cause you're all in my head like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

Say somethin' cause youre driving me crazy
Say somethin' cause youre driving me wild
Say somethin' the was you're working it baby its
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

When we talk girl, fireworks something like the 4th of July
You're super hot, fire hot something like the sun in the sky
(Pretty hot babe)

Burnin' up Burnin' up show em' what you got
Yeah you got it baby let it show
Turn it up, turn it up
Let me know whats up
Don't just stand there girl I gotta know

Say somethin' if your feeling the vibe
Say somethin' baby don't be so shy
Say somethin' cause youre all in my head like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

Say somethin' cause youre driving me crazy
Say somethin' cause youre driving me wild
Say somethin' the was youre working it baby its
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

Hey baby tell me something lady 
I gotta know what's up I gotta know right now
Hey baby tell me something lady
I gotta know what's up I gotta know right now

Say somethin' if your feeling the vibe
Say somethin' baby don't be so shy
Say somethin' cause youre all in my head like
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah

Say somethin' cause youre driving me crazy
Say somethin' cause youre driving me wild
Say somethin' the was you're working it baby its
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Katherine Phan.
