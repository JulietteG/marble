Lemme get it, ain't no playing with it
Lemme get it, Lemme get it

Fire, make it shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot
Youre so automatic
Cant none of them see you
Five stars going off on 'em baby
I love how you flex
Your style is so crazy, youre a fire on the set
Youre a problem, girl, gotta get you
Aint no waitin with it
The one you came here with
Tell that boy forget it
Too fadeds what to tell him
'Cause I got him next
You dont need no explanation
Let him see and figure it out

Your eyes are telling that youre riding with me
But Id be lyin if I didnt admit
The things I wanna say to you right here
I didnt said it but I just cant say it til I said it

Youre a banga banga banga banga 
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, Im gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You aint gonna play with that
Show me where that turn up at

Youre a banga banga banga banga 
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, Im gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You aint gonna play with that
Show me where that turn up at

You gotta promise, if I let you hop up in the Jeep
You gon turn up in the seat
You like ridin, dont ya?
(You aint gonna play with that)
You like ridin, dont ya?
(You aint gonna play with that, show me where that turn up at)

I don said it, now what you gon do
Formal introduction
You got me focused, now its time for you to show me something
Youre like a trophy on my dash
A diamond that you are
Love to see you shining like a proper superstar
Got me asthmatic
'Cause youre like a perfect ballerina
Im on my Brad Pitt, come and be my future Angelina
(Now you know enough to get it)
Baby, if you let me love you, I aint never gonna stop

Youre a banga banga banga banga
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, Im gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You aint gonna play with that
Show me where that turn up at

Youre a banga banga banga banga
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, Im gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You aint gonna play with that
Show me where that turnt up at

Show me-show me, where that turn up-turn up
Show me-show me, where that-where that
Show me-show me, turn up-turn up
Where that turn up at

Your eyes are telling that youre riding with me
But Id be lyin if I didnt admit
The things I wanna say to you right here
I didnt said it but I just cant say it til I said it

Youre a banga banga banga banga
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, Im gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You aint gonna play with that
Show me where that turn up at

Youre a banga banga banga banga
I wanna pledge a bet
Before the night is over
Girl, Im gonna make it that
So, promise if I make you mine
So, promise if I make you mine
You aint gonna play with that
Show me where that turn up at

You gotta promise, if I let you hop up in the Jeep
You gon turn up in the seat
You like ridin, dont ya?
(You aint gotta play with that)
You like ridin, dont ya?
(You aint gotta play with that, show me where that turn up at)
You like ridin, dont ya?---Lyrics submitted by Katherine Phan.
