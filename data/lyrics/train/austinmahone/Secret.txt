Turn it up and shake the ground
Tell me what's on your mind
Come on now, don't be shy
This is the perfect time
This is the perfect time

OK, we found this empty house
Hit the sirens, call 'em out
Get the homies round and round
Get loud

Everybody's got a secret
Tell me yours and I'ma keep it
Yeah, there is nothing to hide
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight

Break it down, it's alright
Bring it out to the light
Breathing it out, stepping it out, yeah
Let the music free your mind, your mind, yeah

OK, we found this empty house
Hit the sirens, call 'em out
Get the homies round and round
Get loud

Everybody's got a secret
Tell me yours and I'ma keep it
Yeah, there is nothing to hide
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight

You are not alone
I'm your safety zone
You are not alone
Don't need to hide what you can't control
I'm your safety zone, safety zone, safety zone

Everybody's got a secret
Tell me yours and I'ma keep it
Yeah, there is nothing to hide
Tell me all your secrets tonight

Everybody's got a secret
Tell me yours and I'ma keep it
Yeah, there is nothing to hide
Tell me all your secrets tonight
(Tell me, tell me)
Tell me all your secrets tonight
(Tell me, tell me)
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight
Tell me all your secrets tonight ---
