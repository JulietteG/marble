[Verse 1]
I, I'm feeling your thunder
The storms getting closer
This rain is like fire
And my, my worlds going under
And I cant remember
The reason that you cut off the line

[Bridge]
Youre moving on, you say
Here I stay
Ill take this pain
Yeah, I can, I can

[Chorus]
What about love?
What about our promises?
What about love?
You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love?
What about us to the end?
What about love?
You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love? [x2]

[Verse 2]
Why-y you're colder than winter?
Youre switching the picture
You used to be perfect, yeah (yeah)
Once youre hot like the summer
Please help me remember
The reason that you said bye bye bye

[Bridge]
Youre moving on, you say
Here I stay
Ill take this pain
Yeah, I can, I can

[Chorus]
What about love?
What about our promises?
What about love?
You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love?
What about us to the end?
What about love?
You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love? [x2]

[Middle 8 - x4]
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
What about, what about love?

[Bridge]
Youre moving on, you say
Here I stay
Watching every night get colder
Youre moving on, you say
Here I stay
Ill take this pain
Yeah, I can, I can

[Chorus]
What about love?
What about our promises?
What about love?
You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love?
What about us to the end?
What about love?
You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love?
What about, what about love?
What about
What about love?
What about, what about love?
What about
What about love?---Lyrics submitted by Katherine Phan.
