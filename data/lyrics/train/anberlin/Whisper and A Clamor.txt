Growing tired of bedside resolve 
Public display of depression
Somethings got to give now 
Somethings going to break down 
I've grown tired of writing songs 
Where people listen but never hear whats really going on now 
Tell me what so wrong now

Clap your hands all ye children  
There a clamor in your whispering 
Clap your hands tonight
Hear what the silent screams 
Clap your hands, 
Clap your hands now all ye children, 
Clap your hands all ye children, 
There's a clamor in your whispering tonight 

For most who live and breathe hell is never knowing they you are now 
(tell me who u are now)
Finally saved from the outside trapped in what you know 
Are you safe from your self? Can you escape all by your self? 

Clap your hands all ye children
There a clamor in your whispering 
Clap your hands tonight 
Hear what the silent screams 
Clap your hands, 
Clap your hands now all ye children 
clap your hands all ye children 
There's a clamor in your whispering tonight 

Its not the lies that you sing 
But what the silence will scream 
Its not the lies that you sing
But what the silence will scream 
Its not the lies that you sing
But what the silence will scream 

Clap your hands all ye children 
Theres a clamor in your whispering 
Clap your hands tonight  
Hear what  the silent screams 
Clap your hands, 
Clap your hands now all ye children 
Clap your hands all ye children 
There's a clamor in your whispering tonight---Lyrics submitted by Daisy.
