Woah oh! Yea yea! Woah oh yea yea woah oh!
Woah oh! Yea yea! Woah oh yea yea woah oh!

Live for today, we'll dream tomorrow
We've got big plans in sight
We'll take this city, and by nightfall
the bright lights are calling
Everything is going our way
Everything is just as we planned
This is our future for what we've heard,
and i've still got your hand

And it feels like, we could last forever
And I'm not doing this alone

When memories fade, we've got eachother
When time and confusion collide
singing, "I hold it all when I hold you."
When friends walk other ways, we've got eachother
I hold it all when I hold, I hold it all when I hold you

Woah oh! Yea yea!
Woah oh yea yea woah oh!

We fell on hard times
This isn't the ideal
We're miles from home, doing the best that we can (the best that we can)
I wont do this without you (do this without you)
Wont do this without you so take heart
'Cause you know that you have mine

And it feels like, we could last forever
And I'm not doin' this alone.

When memories fade, we've got eachother
When time and confusion collide
singing, "I hold it all when I hold you."
When friends walk other ways, we've got eachother
I hold it all when I hold, I hold it all when I hold..

It's not about the money we make
It's about the passions that we ache for
What makes your heart beat faster
Tell me now, what does your body long after
I don't care now where we live
It's not where, or what, or who we were with.
I just need you in my life, so promise me again!

When memories fade, we've got eachother
When time and confusion collide
singing "I hold it all when I hold you."
When friends walk other ways, we've got eachother
I hold it all when I hold, I hold it all when I hold you

Woah oh! Yea yea!
Woah oh yea yea woah oh!---Lyrics submitted by Markie.
