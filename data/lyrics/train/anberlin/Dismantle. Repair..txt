One last glance from my taxi cab
Images scar my mind
For weeks felt like years
Since your full attention was all mine
The night was young and so were we
Talked about life, god, death and your family
Did not want any promises just my undivided honesty

And you said,  oh, ahoh (ahoh) things are going to change now for the better 
OH ahoh things are gonna change,  oh they gonna change

I am the patron saint of lost causes, a fraction of who i once believed 
Change,  it's only a matter of time 
Opinions i would like to try and rewrite 
If life had backround music playing your song 
I've got to be honest, I tried to escape you
But the orchestra plays on 

and they sang, oh ahoh (ahoh) things are going to change now for the better
 and Oh ahoh (ahoh) things are gonna change

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep form you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
dismantle me down, repair you 
dismantle me, you'll dismantle me

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep form you
Lines and phrases like knives your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, repair you
Dismantle me, you'll dismantle me

Give me time to prove, prove I want the rest of yours
Prelude, call this a prelude to a life time of you 
Its not that i hang on every word, I hang myself on the words you repeat
It's not that I keep hanging on
I'm never letting go

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives, your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, repair you
Dismantle me, you'll dismantle me

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives, your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, repair you
Dismantle me, you'll dismantle me

Save me from myself. 
Save me from myself
Help me save me from myself
Save me from myself

Oh ahoh (ahoh) Things are gonna change now for the better
Oh ahoh (ahoh) Things are gonna change

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives, your words can cut me through
Dismantle me down, repair you
Dismantle me, you'll dismantle me

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives, your words can cut me through
dismantle me down, repair you
Dismantle me, you'll dismantle me

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives, your words can cut me through
dismantle me down, repair you
Dismantle me, you'll dismantle me

Hands like secrets are the hardest things to keep from you
Lines and phrases like knives, your words can cut me through
dismantle me down, repair you
Dismantle me, you'll dismantle me---Lyrics submitted by Mya.
