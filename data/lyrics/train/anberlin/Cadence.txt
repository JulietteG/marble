Write down, to remind yourself
On how it can be
How it can be
Heartstrings, you're tugging on my heartstrings
My heartstrings

Helpless, I have become so helpless to your touch
Oh, touch me somehow
Restless, you leave me restless
Breathless, wait for me

{Chorus} 
The closer I come to you
The closer I am to finding, God
You're a miracle to me!
The closer I come to you
The closer I am to finding, God
You're a miracle to me!


Burning,
Like Joan of Arc
To see you, just to feel you
Cadence, well i'd dance with the dead
Cause I believe, yes I believe, yes I believe

Stifle
Paul said that you,
Stifle him, again and again and again!

{[Chorus]}

And if these are my parting words
Grant me this
My last, request.
Hold me here, until I sleep
If I burn, then I burn, for, you

{{{MUSIC}}}

*The closer I come to you
The closer I am to finding--God*
**repeat**
