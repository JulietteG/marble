Burning down Neverland (scatter the ashes)
white knights black tar the matches
Is this another death by misadventure
tell me what you got, what you really got (HEY HEY)
Well rest in our graves,
Lexington coarse your veins
Sleepers can't just wake the dead
when needles and lovers collapse on guilty beds

Fall asleep (don't fall asleep)
don't fall asleep

(They lied when they said that the good die young)

They lied when they said the good die young
woah-oh-ah-oh
They lied when they said the good die young
stay with me, stay with me tonight

Burning down bridges now (scatter the ashes)
Godspeed to all you're after
Is this a life left just to remember
Tell them who you were, who you really were (HEY HEY)
Kill yourself slowly over time, fashion statement suicide
She's still asleep in a Chelsea hotel
bad turns to worse and the worst turns into hell

Fall asleep (don't fall asleep)
Don't fall asleep

(God save the eyes that dim tonight)

They lied when they said the good die young
woah-oh-ah-oh
They lied when they said the good die young
stay with me, stay with me tonight

(woah-oh-ah-oh)

They lied when they said the good die young
woah-oh-ah-oh
They lied when they said the good die young
stay with me, stay with me tonight---Lyrics submitted by Connor.
