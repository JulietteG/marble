Do you memorize theatrical lines
that seem to lead them in
Play the role with the good girl heart
add the tangled webs within
Who was it that lead you on
that makes you want to hurt me so
Who do you want to forget
who forgot you long ago

Do you still feel him
calling in the air tonight
do you still feel it
seems like you've done this before
You make breaking hearts look so easy
seem like you've done this before
You've got breaking hearts all but down
and you've done this, you've done this before
You make stealing hearts look so easy
Where is the girl I adore
You've got breaking up all but down
I can't love a thief anymore

Do you collect the souls you've lost
in the top of your dresser drawer
count the number of tears displaced
on lonely bedroom floors
where the shape of your heart once was
slowly takes the place of you
will they hold the memories now
of the love I though I knew

Do you still feel him
calling in the air tonight
do you still feel it
seems like you've done this before
You make breaking hearts look so easy
seem like you've done this before
You've got breaking hearts all but down
and you've done this, you've done this before
You make stealing hearts look so easy
Where is the girl I adore
You've got breaking up all but down
I can't love a thief anymore

You make breaking hearts look so easy
You've got breaking up all but down
You make breaking hearts look so easy
Seems like you've done this before
You've got breaking hearts all but down
You've done this, you've done this before

The most you could hope to be
now just a bitter sweet memory---Lyrics submitted by Syvilla.
