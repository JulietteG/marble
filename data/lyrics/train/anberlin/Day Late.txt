So let me get this straight
Say now you love me all along
What makes you hesitate
to tell me with words what you really feel

I can see it in your eyes you mean all of what you say
I remember so long ago, see I felt the same way
Now we both have separate lifes and lovers ( lovers)
Insignificantly enough we both have significant others

Only time will tell
Time will turn and tell

We are who we were when
Could've been lovers but at least
You're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when

Who knew what we know now
Could've been more but at least
You're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when

But thoughts may change and times they rearrange 
I don't know who you are anymore
Loves comes and go and this I know
I'm not who you recall anymore

But I muss confess 
You're so much more than I remember
Can't help but entertain these thoughts
Thoughts of us together

We are who we were when
Could've been lovers but at least
You're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when

Who knew what we know now
Could've been lovers but at least
You're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when

my day late friend

so let me get this straight
all these years and you were nowhere to be found
and now you want me for your own
but your a day late and my love she's still around

We are who we were when
Could've been lovers but at least
You're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when

Who knew what we know now
Could've been more but at least
You're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when

We are who we were when
Could've been lovers but at least
You're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when---Lyrics submitted by Milyah.
