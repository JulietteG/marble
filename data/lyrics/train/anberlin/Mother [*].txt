Mother tell your children not to walk my way,
tell your children no to hear my words,
what they mean, what they say,
Mother,

Mother can you keep them in the dark for life,
can you hide them from the waiting world,
Mother,

Father,
gonna take your daughter out tonight,
gonna show her my world,
Father,

Not about to see your lie,
But if you want find hell with me,
I can show you what it's like til your bleeding,

Not about to see your lie,
But if you want to find hell with me,
I can show you what it's like,

Mother,
Tell your children not to hold my hand,
Tell your children not to understand,
Mother,

Father,
Do you want to bang heads with me,
Do you want to feel everything, 
Father,

Not about to see your lie,
But if you want to find hell with me,
I can show you what it's like til your bleeding,
[x3]

Mother,
Mother.....---Lyrics submitted by Brandon.
