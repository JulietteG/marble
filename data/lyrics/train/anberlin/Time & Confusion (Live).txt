Woah oh, yeah-ah
Woah oh, yeah-ah
Woah oh

Live for today
We'll dream tomorrow
We've got big plans in sight
We'll take this city and by nightfall...
The bright lights are calling

Everything is going our way
Everything is just as we've planned
This is our future (from what we've heard)
And I've still got your hand

And it feels like we could last forever
And I'm not doing this alone

When memories fade
We've got each other
When time and confusion collide
Singin' I hold it all when I hold you
When friends walk other ways
We've got each other
I hold it all when I hold
I hold it all when I hold you

Woah oh, yeah-ah
Woah oh, yeah-ah
Woah oh

We fell on hard times
This isn't the ideal
We're miles from home
Doing the best that we can (best that we can)

I won't do this without you
I won't do this without you
So take heart...
'cause you know that you have mine

And it feels like we could last forever
And I'm not doing to do this alone

Its not about the money we make
Its about the passions that we ache for
What makes your heart beat faster
Tell me now what does your body long after

I don't care now where we live
It's not where, or what, or who we were with
I just need you in my life
So promise me again

When memories fade
We've got each other
When time and confusion collide
Singin' I hold it all when I hold you
When friends walk other ways
We've got each other
I hold it all when I hold
I hold it all when I hold you

Woah oh, yeah-ah
Woah oh, yeah-ah
Woah oh---
