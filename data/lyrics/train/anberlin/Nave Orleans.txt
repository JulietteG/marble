Come and go now as you please
Your actions write the melodies
To the songs that we sing
And you just sing

And I finally found that life goes on without you
And my world still turns when you're not around

Is this the way you want it?
Is this the way it has to be?
Sitting here beside you
With my heart's lost in New Orleans
Dreams come clever
Hearts now severed
Difference of forever
And I am lost there

Well I finally found that life goes on without you
And my world still turns when you're not around 
And I finally found that life goes on without you
And my world still turns when you're not around 
And I finally find that all..

Your actions write the melodies
To the songs that we sing 
Your actions write the melodies
To the songs that we sing 
And you just sing along out loud, yeah

Come and go now as you please
Your actions write the melodies
To the songs that we sing
And you just sing

Well I finally found that life goes on without you
And my world still turns when you're not around 
And I finally found that life goes on without you
And my world still turns when you're not around 
And I finally find that all..

Your actions write the melodies
To the songs that we sing
Your actions write the melodies
To the songs that we sing
And you just sing along out.. loud!---Lyrics submitted by Sofeeaaa.
