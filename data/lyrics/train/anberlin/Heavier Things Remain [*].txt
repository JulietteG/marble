A Hollow Hallelujah hangs in the corner,
With the rest of out dissolving years,

Your the storm and the calm,
The dove and the bone,
The ghost that relieves all my fears, 

Don't let this bedroom go, 
Cause' years and sheets have formed,
We'll be able to sleep all alone,

The weight of the world is on top of me,
And I wouldn't have you anywhere else,
The weight of the world is on top of me, 
And I want you here all to myself,

Like a land worthy sailor,
I even falter at failure, 
Trying to find my heading back home,
Your the cure and the disease,
The vice I still need, 
The cast in the break in my bones,
Your the life that's worth living,
Your heard and forgiving,
Your Jesus to the demons you put in my head,

The weight of the world is on top of me,
And I wouldn't have you anywhere else,
The weight of the world is on top of me, 
And I want you here all to myself,

The weight of the world is on top of me,
And I wouldn't have you anywhere else,
The weight of the world is on top of me,
And I want you here all to myself,

The weight of the world,
The weight of the world is on top of me,
And I want you hear all to myself.---Lyrics submitted by Sammy.
