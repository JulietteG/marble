Tired of my beeper, tired of my phone
Tired of this tired old tie I've got on
Sick of this traffic jam that I'm in
We all get sick of it all now and then
When I've had it up to here I go down there

(Chorus)
To guitars and tiki bars and a whole lotta love
Mangos and marley you know fit me like a glove
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer when enough is enough
guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love

I feel like a fish jerked out of the sea
Or a bird in a cage that'll never see the key
Sick of this grind and I think I ought
To bring this grind to a grinding halt
When I've had it up to here I go down there

(Chorus)

Now I've had it up to here, let's go down there

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Jared.
