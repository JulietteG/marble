Dont really know what day it is
Been rocking nine days in a row
All I know is its hurricane season
And any minute she's gonna blow

I need a shave and I need some rest
I know some people are worried about me
But I'm French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea

Went through customs and immigration
Still this feels like home
Im floating 'round through Gorda Sound
With a cooler and a bong

Maybe I could've been a pirate
Maybe in my next life that's what I'll be
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea

Tonight I dont need to feel famous
Out here all I feel is free
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea

Maybe I could've been a pirate
Maybe in my next life that's what Ill be
French kissing life square in the mouth
Sailing out on the sea---Lyrics submitted by John Robbins.
