It seems like everything that's good in life you've got to wait for
I came... dad said on a lake in Tennessee
And it's like sitting there and learning
Just to watch the morning sunrise
All I know is what it does to me

It's like Friday night working on a three day weekend
Something in a jar just made for sipping
It's feeling like a feel good time bomb ticking
Standing round waiting on beer can chicken
It's the little things that make life worth living

That old jam box playing in the background takes me somewhere
Back to some old lake, not country highway radio
I've got all my friends hanging out, sitting right here with me
When I get this old feeling I just know

It's like Friday night working on a three day weekend
Something in a jar just made for sipping
It's feeling like a feel good time bomb ticking
Standing round waiting on beer can chicken
It's the little things that make life worth living

Would you look at this night that we've been given
It's the little things that make life worth living
Would you look at this night that we've been given
It makes life worth living

It's like Friday night working on a three day weekend
Something in a jar just made for sipping
It's feeling like a feel good time bomb ticking
Standing round waiting on beer can chicken
It's the little things that make life worth living

Turn it up, let's go
Pretty girl dancing... by the sea shore
Dirt track, turn to four
Peddle to the metal, gonna show you what we're here for
Six strings, good songs
Old wooden bowl with a skull and crossbones
Full moon, that's right
Green grass, clear the lights, just waiting on high time
And beer can chicken
Just look at this life that we've been given---
