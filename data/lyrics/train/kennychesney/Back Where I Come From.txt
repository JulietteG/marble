Well, in the town where I was raised
The clock ticks and the cattle graze
Time passed with amazing grace
Back where I come from

You could lie on a riverbank
Or paint your name on a water tank
Miscount all the beers you drank
Back where I come from

Back where I come from
Where I'll be when it's said and done
Well, I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from

We learned in a Sunday school
Who made the sun shine through
I know who made the moon shine too
Back, where I come from

Blue eyes on a Saturday night
Tan legs in the broad daylight
TV's, they were black and white
Back where I come from

Back where I come from
Where I'll be when it's said and done
Well, I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from

Some say it's a backward place
Narrow minds on the narrow way
But I make it a point to say
That's where I come from

That's where I come from
Where I'll be when it's said and done
Well, I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from

That's where I come from
I'm an old Tennessean
(I'm proud)
I'm proud as anyone
That's where I come from

That's where I come from
That's where I come from
That's where I come from---Lyrics submitted by Henry.
