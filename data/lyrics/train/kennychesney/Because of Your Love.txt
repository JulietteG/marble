Baby, I don't understand
Now, just the touch of your hand can make me feel invincible
Do you know just where you take me?
Do you know how high you make me?
I need your kiss like oxygen

With your arms warm around me
When your eyes look deep into me
It's unstoppable, baby, anything is possible

Everything I wanna be, any dream I wanna dream
I can, because of your love
Anywhere I ever go with all of my heart I know
I am the man I am because of your love

Don't know how I lived before you
Now I live to explore you
Take me girl to your secret world
Where I could swim in your deep blue passion
Or I could feel your love come crashing over me, endlessly

Whether your right by my side or
Whether you and I are a million miles apart
I can always feel you in my heart

Everything I wanna be, any dream I wanna dream
I can, because of your love
Anywhere I ever go with all of my heart I know
I am the man I am because of your love

Everything I wanna be, any dream I wanna dream
I can, because of your love
Anywhere I ever go with all of my heart I know
I am the man I am because of your love
Ooh, baby, because of your love---
