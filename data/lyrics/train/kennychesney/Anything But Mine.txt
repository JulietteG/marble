Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile,
Me and Mary making our way into the night,
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides,
The pinball bills, skee ball slides,
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight,
Theres a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel wall to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

And in the morning Im leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Theres a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Marys wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her,
We both laugh cause we know it isnt true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

And in the morning Im leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I dont see how you could ever be anything but mine

Ooooooooo..

And in the morning Im leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I dont see how you could ever be anything but mine

Mary I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Ooooooooooo...ooooooooooooooo...

...And in the morning Im leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
Hey, I dont see how you could ever be anything but mine---Lyrics submitted by MaryJean sznurkowski.
