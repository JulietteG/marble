The news today ain't nothing new to me at all 
The same old shit again the greed, the war it's all the same 

Burning cars and wounded 
Melting ice and droughts 
The end of the world is nearing 
So I'll be sending out a message to you all 

[chorus] 
I read the news today 'bout a world of gray 
Somebody's dropping bombs on an earthquake 
I read the news today 'bout a world of gray 
Somebody's dropping bombs on an earthquake 
And I just wanna dance - uh uh uh uh 

The world is still unfair - Every channel a new nightmare 
If I bury my head is shame who shoulders all the blame? 

I'd rather dance to the music 
Calm you down with moves 
Let's dance and ride this storm out 
And we can send out a message to them all 

[chorus] 
I read the news today 'bout a world of gray 
Somebody's dropping bombs on an earthquake 
I read the news today 'bout a world of gray 
Somebody's dropping bombs on an earthquake 
And I just wanna dance - uh uh uh uh 

There's no need for me to grieve 
I dance for free please look at me 

Dance to enhance the romance in the world and stop moping around 
Dance to enhance the romance in the world and stop moping around 

One leg to the right, one leg to the left 
One leg to the right, one leg to the left 
One leg to the right, one leg to the left 
One leg to the right, this is a message to you all... 

[chorus] 
I read the news today 'bout a world of gray 
Somebody's dropping bombs on an earthquake 
I read the news today 'bout a world of gray 
Somebody's dropping bombs on an earthquake 
And I just wanna dance - uh uh uh uh---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
