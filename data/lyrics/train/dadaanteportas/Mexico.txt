Shes on her way to Mexico I know 
She doesnt want to go 
But where she comes from theres no way 
Theres no place, for a girl like here these days 

What she leaves is already lost 
Freedom has its cost 
A home can be lost she found out 
When all answers fly away with her doubt 

Will she make her way over the ocean? 
Will she find her kind over the sea? 
Its hard to take the unknown in exchange for home 
But she feels like  Mexico 

Shes on her way to Mexico 
To escape from her tale of woe 
Living quietly with her dread 
Alive or dead  is it all in her head? 

The further she gets the less she regrets 
Freedoms replacing all threats 
Standing knee-deep in the sea 
The moonlit tide is setting her free 

Will she make her way over the ocean? 
Will she find her kind over the sea? 
Its hard to take the unknown in exchange for home 
But she feels like  Mexico 

Will she make her way over the ocean? 
Will she find her kind over the sea? 
Its hard to take the unknown in exchange for home 
But she feels like  Mexico---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
