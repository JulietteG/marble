I don't wanna talk to you 'bout my girl 
I don't wanna talk to you 'bout that 
I don't wanna talk to you 'bout my cock 
I don't wanna talk to you 'bout that 

everybody talks too much 'bout everything I know 
everybody wants to have a show 

everybody talks without permission 
everybody on their own condition 
damn, be aware of your 
serious omission 

yeah, yeah, yeah 
you're a bigmouth 
yeah, yeah, yeah 
you're a thight ass 
yeah, yeah, yeah 
be aware of your 
serious omission 
serious omission 

I don't wanna talk about our CD 
I don't wanna talk you're outta luck 
I don't wanna read your lousy magazine 
I don't really give a flying fuck 

everybody writes too much 'bout everything I know 
everybody wants to have his show 

everybody talks without permission 
everybody on their own condition 
damn, be aware of your 
serious omission 

yeah, yeah, yeah 
you're a bigmouth 
yeah, yeah, yeah 
you're a thight ass 
yeah, yeah, yeah 
be aware of your 
serious omission 
serious omission 
serious omission 
serious omission 

yeah, I don't wanna talk to you 

yeah, everybody talks without permission 
everybody on their own condition 
damn, be aware of your 
serious omission 

everybody talks without permission 
everybody on their own condition 
damn, be aware of your 
serious omission 

yeah, yeah, yeah 
you're a bigmouth 
yeah, yeah, yeah 
you're a thight ass 
yeah, yeah, yeah 
be aware of your 
serious omission
