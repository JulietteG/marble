Oh let me tell 
let me tell my own story 
please close your eyes 
close your eyes just to listen 

I remember the days I was sure 
all the people I know were so pure 
but the world is not that black and white 
and I learned 
fear just keeps you down 

I'm not afraid 
I'm not afraid no 
won't barricade 
won't barricade no 

I'm not afraid 
I'm not afraid no 
won't barricade 
won't barricade no 

oh wake me up 
wake me up from this cold dream 
oh all your faces 
all your faces look so stone-cold 

I remember the people were smiling 
now I see all the same ones are crying 
I confess that's a thing that I 
worry about 
but fear just keeps you down 

I'm not afraid 
I'm not afraid no 
won't fade away 
won't fade away no 

I'm not afraid 
I'm not afraid no 
won't masquerade 
won't masquerade no 

I'm not afraid 
I'm not afraid no 
won't barricade 
won't barricade no 

I'm not afraid 
I'm not afraid no 
won't barricade 
won't barricade no---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
