I am paying for my mistake
That's okay
I know when I will pull in
It's a short f-cking movie, man
I know
I will try and take it slow
Bought a lot of colour drugs
Come on, what's it about?
Gave me sick to make me well
Come on, what the hell

I got up in the world today
Wondered who it was I could save
Who do you think you are?
Just a girl
That can play guitar
I think I could get away with
Saying only half what I say
No, I can't give you up
Oh no, I'm not gonna stop
But they know
But they'll never know why
They know
But they'll never know why

I don't know what we're afraid of
No, I don't mind
Oh no, I don't mind
If I fall in love to the sound of birds
On the wing
And kiss, I'm loving
They know
But they'll never know why
They know
But they'll never know why
They know that I loved you
But they don't know why
They know that I loved you
But they'll never know why
Kicking off, it's kicking off

Now it's short f-cking movie, man
It's a short f-cking movie, man
It's a short f-cking movie, man
It's a short f-cking movie, man
I know
I won't try and take your soul
I know
I won't try to take your soul---
