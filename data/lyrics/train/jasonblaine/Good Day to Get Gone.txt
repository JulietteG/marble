Just got my paycheck 
I say we cash it
That city limit
Lets blow right past it
Girl put your sunglasses on 
Its a good day to get gone 

We've always wondered 
Whats down that highway
I swear i hear it 
Its calling our names
We put off leavin to long 
Its a good day to get gone 

Let these wheels spin round 
Baby its time to take us some time 
Before the sun goes down 
Its chasin across that blue sky
That clock keeps on tickin 
And life is for livin
So what are we waitin on
Its a good day to get gone 

That piece of heaven 
Is out there somewhere
We're gonna find it
We're gonna get there
Baby thats where we belong
Its a good day to get gone 

Let these wheels spin round 
Baby its time to take us some time 
Before the sun goes down 
Its chasin across that blue sky
That clock keeps on tickin 
And life is for livin
So what are we waitin on
Its a good day to get gone 

You'll be feet on the dash 
And aerosmith song 
I'll hit the gas
You sing along

Let these wheels spin round 
Baby its time to take us some time 
Before the sun goes down 
Its chasin across that blue sky
That clock keeps on tickin 
And life is for livin
So what are we waitin on
Baby what are we waitin on
Its a good day to get gone 

Its a good day to get gone

Just got my paycheck 

I say we cash it 

That city limit

Lets blow right past it 

Yeaa

Its a good day to get gone---Lyrics submitted by Jon.
