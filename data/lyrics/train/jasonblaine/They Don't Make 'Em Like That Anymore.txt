He still combs his hair like Elvis
Pays cash for everything 
and he'll only drive a chevy and thinks Alan Jackson's king
He knows everyone by name at the local hardware store
They dont make 'em like that anymore
Up with the sun each mornin'
Hardly missed a day of work
Summer 1957 he helped build that Lutheran church
Believes a man should work all week but save Sunday for the Lord
They dont make 'em like that anymore
Standin' shoulder to shoulder with him now, 
I still feel small
And I'm still lookin' up to him like he's ten feet tall
There's somethin about that generation
These days I think we need 'em
More than we ever did before
But they dont make 'em like that anymore
He married his sweet Mary 
June 1955
He goes on and on about her
Her casseroles, her clear blue eyes
He still helps her with her coat, 
Still opens her car door
They dont make 'em like that anymore
Standin' shoulder to shoulder with him now, 
I still feel small
And I'm still lookin up to him like he's ten feet tall
Theres somethin' about that generation
These days I think we need 'em
More than we ever did before
But they dont make 'em like that anymore
Theres somethin about that generation
These days I think we need 'em
More than we ever did before
Yeah thats for sure
But they dont make 'em like that anymore
He still combs his hair like Elvis
Pays cash for everything...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
