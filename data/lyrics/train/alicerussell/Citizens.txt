Citizens of planet earth don't get caught in the act
Don't strive to destruction the flash it's just that
There's something behind these walls, something under the sheets ,I stay
A truth that's been locked in way down in me

You've got to get up , around your space
And take a, take a little time to contemplate
Will we ever see what it's like behind these walls
And are you, are you still moving up everytime you fall, you fall

Think a little about what you got
Stop , think a little about what you got
And start again

I could be you, you
And you , you
You could be me , me
And I , I , I could be you , you
And you , you
You could be me , me

I could be you, you
And you , you
You could be me , me
And I , I , I could be you , you
And you , you
And this we learned we would be free ---
