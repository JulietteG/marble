I go out in public now
More than you might think
But only after pills and drinks
Thats how i remember
And if i see any girl
Ive ever met before
I run like hell for the door
Thats how i remember
Memory records
Selected shorts
And interpretations
Then later plays them back
As gospel fact
Thats how i remember
Thats how i remember
With one eye open
You can focus like a camera
On whomever you are capturing
Without exception i prefer it
As a way to document
The objects of my interest
Red and yellow
Black and white
Are precious in his sight
But who he roots for in a fight
Thats how i remember
So every time i find a girl
Beaten, gagged and bound
I let her go and write it down
ooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooo
Thats how i remember
Thats how i remember---
