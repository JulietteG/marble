How I love her, backlit against the door
I know theres no excuse for me
I need her absolutely
Its what I cant control
And she is so beautiful to me
But look at her now

Shes got such a pretty face

I remember how shed cry to me for more
Something Ill never hear again
And some nights I imagine
Shell call some other name
Someone whose love for her remains under control

Shes got such a pretty face

Housing commission home
And a long-term government home loan
Work goes off and on
And the teenage honeymoon is long gone
I could never win it for you
Now Im gonna lose alone
Because youre taking one last look at me
In all the years, the last youll see

And now to show I love her
I cannot reach the words
And in the silence Im afraid
Ill hit her again

Shes got such a pretty face
Such a broken face---Lyrics submitted by B Mackay.
