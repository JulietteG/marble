Hold on
Hold on
Hold onto yourself
For this is gonna hurt like Hell

Hold on
Hold onto yourself
For this is gonna hurt like Hell
Hold on
Hold onto yourself
You know that only time can tell
What is it in me that refuses to believe
This isn't easier than the real thing

My love
You know that you're my best friend
You know I'd do anything for you
And my love
Let nothing come between us
My love for you is strong and true

Am I in Heaven here or am I...?
At the crossroads I am standing

(Time...
Only time...
Only time...
Only time...)

My love
You know that you're my best friend
You know I'd do anything for you
And my love
Let nothing come between us
My love for you is strong and true

Am I in Heaven here or am I...?
At the crossroads I am standing

Now you're sleeping peaceful
I lie awake and pray
That you'll be strong tomorrow
And will see another day
And we will praise it
And love the light that brings a smile
Across your face...

Oh God, if you're out there
Won't you hear me?
I know that we've never talked before
But oh God, the man I love is leaving
Won't you take him
When he come to your door?

Am I in Heaven here or am I in Hell?
At the crossroads I am standing

Now you're sleeping peaceful
I lie awake and pray
That you'll be strong tomorrow
And we'll see another day
And we will praise it
And love the light that brings a smile
Across your face...---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
