Spend all your time waiting for that second chance
For a break that would make it OK
There's always some reason to feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction or a beautiful release 
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty or weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel far away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear.
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie;
You're in the arms of the angel, may you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line, and everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies
That make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference, escape one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel far away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel, may you find some comfort here

You're in the arms of the angel, may you find some comfort here---Lyrics submitted by Robin MacDonald.
