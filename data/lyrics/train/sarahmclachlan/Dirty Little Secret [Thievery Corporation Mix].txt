If I had the chance love
I would not hesitate
To tell you all the things
I'd never said before
Don't tell me it's too late
`Cause I've relied on my illusions
To keep me warm at night
And I've denied in my capacity to love
But I am willing to give up this fight

Been up all night drinking
To drown my sorrow down
Nothing seems to help me
Since you went away
I'm so tired of this town
Where every tongue is wagging
When every back is turned
They're telling secrets
That should never be revealed
There's nothing to be gained
But disaster
Here's a good one
Did you hear about my friend
He's embarrassed to be seen now
`Cause we
All know
His sins...

`Cause I've relied on my illusions...

If I had the chance love
You know I would not hesitate
To tell you all the things
I never said before
Don't tell me it's too late
`Cause I've relied on my illusions
To keep me warm at night
And I've denied in my capacity to love
But I am willing to give up this fight
Oh I am willing to give up this fight---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
