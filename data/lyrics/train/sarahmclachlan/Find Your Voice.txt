There's a lot tryin' to bring us down,
The pay is cheap, the lines are long, and, oh,
I can't get a live voice on the phone

Everyone's in such a rush,
No time to stop and enjoy the hush
Of a quiet word
To let you know you're not alone

Oh, it would be such a lovely road
If we could walk together
Let's find our voice,
Shout it from the inside
Let's make a choice
To be the change we want to see
And all rejoice
To find the good in everyone
Shine a light for all to see
In peace and harmony

Merry Christmas
'Tis the season to be kind
But it feels like we're walking on land mines
Just to step away from bringing on disaster

Everywhere the pressure builds, the years of galore?,
The guilt and tears, and, oh,
Just waiting for the damn to break

Oh, it would be such a lovely road
If we could walk together
Let's find our voice,
Shout it from the inside
Let's make a choice
To be the change we want to see
And all rejoice
To find the good in everyone
Shine a light for all to see
In peace and harmony

Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
In peace and harmony
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Shine for all to see
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
In peace and harmony
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
In peace and harmony---
