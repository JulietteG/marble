How come he don't come and P.I.P. with me
Down at the meter no more?
And how come he turn(ed) off the t.v.
And hang(ed) that sign on the door?
Well we call and we call "How come?" we say
Hey what could make a boy behave this-a way, yeah?
And he learn(ed) all of the lines, now, and every time
He gonna s-stutter when he talks
And it's true! It's true! He sure has acquired this kinda cool and inspired sorta jazz when he walk(s)
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans,
If this ain't healthy it is some kinda clean

That means Chuck E's in love                                                                              

I don't believe what you're saying to me
This is something I got to see. Is he here?
I look in the poolhall. Is he here?
I look in the drugstore. Is he here?
No, he don't come here no more

Well I'll tell you what, I saw him
He was sittin' behind us down at the Pantages
And whatever is that he's got up his sleeve
I hope it isn't contagious
What's her name? Is that her there?
Oh Christ, I think he's even combed his hair!
And is that her? Well then what's her name?
Oh, it's never gonna be same.
That's not her
I know what's wrong
'Cause Chuck E's in love with the little girl singing this song
Don't you know
Chuck E's in love, Chuck E's in love
Chuck E's in love, Chuck E's in love ...
Chuck E's in love with me---Lyrics submitted by NELLY.
