I don't know how I let her go
I thought the chain would aways be unbroken. 
Now my heart keeps tellin' me, 
Words I should have said or left unspoken.

So after you are through, 
Doin what you're gonna do.
After you blow her heart away, 
I will still be here to say.

Send her to me, send her to me,
I'm the one who loves her.
Send her to me, send her to me.
I'm the one who needs her.
Send her to me, send her to me.

I can't blame her for a thing. 
I guess you really made her feel, so wanted.
When she sees she was a fool, 
Her empty heart will feel me hauting.

So after you are through,
Making her go through , all the moves. 
After you chase her dreams away,
I will still be here to say

Send her to me, send her to me.
I'm the one who loves her. 
Send her to me, send her to me,
I'm the one who needs her. 
Send her to me, send her to me. 
I'm the one who loves her.
Send her to me, send her to me. 
Oh, I'm the one.---Lyrics submitted by J.
