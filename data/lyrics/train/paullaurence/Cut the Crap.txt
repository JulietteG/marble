Cut the crap go back where we failed
Head over heels
So deep in love
(Can We)
Cut the crap go back where we failed
Head over heels
So deep in love

Girl you gotta stop it
Being so jealous 
Our love will not last
And you gotta stop it
Arguing the moment the moment I walk into the room
I remember how we used to make love, girl
We would rock through the night
Now we cant even communicate normal
Whatever happened to our love
Yeah

Cut the crap go back where we failed
Head over heels
So deep in love
(Can We)
Cut the crap go back where we failed
Head over heels
So deep in love

Boy you better stop it
Being so selfish, think its all about you
And you better stop it
Taking me for granted or our love will be through
Boy you used to show me how much you loved me
You used to tell all the world
Got me hooked on you
And then you take over me
Now whats a girl in love gonna do? Huh?
Cut the crap go back where we failed
(We were so deep in love)
Head over heels
So deep in love
Cut the crap go back where we failed
(so deep in love)
Head over heels
So deep in love
Yeah - - - -

Hey baby can I talk to you for a minute?
Wait a minute
No, no please dont interrupt me
See thats the problem
No respect
You know when we first got together we didnt go through none of this
I used to go to work, come home, go out and play a little ball with the fellas 
Or do whatever I wanted to do
But now if I try something like that I get the first degree murder joint
Baby I cant take it no more
I want a woman whos gone respect me
Whos gonna respect what Im about.Im a man
I already been raised one time by my Mama.and she did a helluva job, yknow what Im sayin?
So if we gone be together, we gotta take it back. to when we first met
When love was wonderful, so beautiful.you know what Im talking about
Or just leave it alone
Now wait a minute, now wait a minute now
There are two sides to every story
And I understand some of the things youre talking about
And I admit that when you come in late I wanna know where you been
And when you leave out the door, I wanna know where you going
And where do you get off talking about all this respect, Mister? 
You know you oughta practice what you preach
Cause I almost gave up on you a long time ago
But love stepped into the picture
And the responsibilities grew
You were doing more for me and I was doing more for you
Like your dirty laundrystanding there washing the skid marks out
I want love to be sweet, too baby
But this is what loves about
Yeah
Cut the crap go back where we failed 
Where we failed baby 
When we were head over heels
So deep in your love
And you know that our love was special
So special
And I still love you
Oh, I love you, too baby
Yeah

Cut the crap go back where we failed---Lyrics submitted by Sensual.
