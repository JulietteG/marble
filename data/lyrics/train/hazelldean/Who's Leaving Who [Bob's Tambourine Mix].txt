Here we are with good-bye in our eyes

running out of reasons to try.
The leaves of change have fallen down
with both of us wondering why.
We're all alone but still it seems
we're thousands of miles apart

The sands of time have shifted now
and the end is beginning to start.

And I don't know the answers

'cause I don't know the questions

I'm just trying 'cause I don't even know -

Who's leaving who? Is it me
is it you?
Do you think we could change if we knew?
Tell me who's leaving who? Is there anything left we can do?
Can you tell me who's leaving who?

Talk to me
is there a chance of working
it out heart to heart?
Can we go beyond our angry eyes
before everything else falls apart?
And I don't know the answers

'cause I don't know the questions

I'm iust trying 'cause I don't even know -

Who's leaving who? Is it me
is it you? . . .

And I don't know the answers

'cause I don't know the questions

I'm iust trying 'cuase I don't even know -

Who's leaving who? Is it me
is it you? . . .---Lyrics submitted by Claudine.
