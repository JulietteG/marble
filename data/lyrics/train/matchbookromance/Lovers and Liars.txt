Let's start out by starting over.
What did I expect?
You're no good at lying and I'm no good at comebacks.
But you're so untouchable.
I'm oh-so-terrible at this.
I'm terrible at this, you know.

Don't hold this against me.
I've already said I'm sorry.

And I bet you've got every word I said 
memorized in your head.
And you'll use every one of them, 
and you'll use every one of them against me.

Don't hold this against me.
I've already said I'm sorry.
(Tell all your friends about me)
Don't hold this against me.
I've already said I'm sorry.

I hope you choke on every word you spoke when you were screaming at me.
And realize how many times I've tried, but that's wishful thinking.
All I want is an apology for what you did and how you treated me.
Get me far away, or at least as far as this car will take me.

I hope you choke on every word you spoke when you were screaming at me.
(Get me far away, or at least as far as this car will take me)
(Tell all your friends about me)

And realize how many times I've tried, but that's wishful thinking. 
(Get me far away, or at least as far as this car will take me)
(Tell all your friends about me)

All I want is an apology for what you did and how you treated me. 
(Get me far away, or at least as far as this car will take me)
(Tell all your friends about me)

I hope you choke on every word you spoke, I hope you choke on every word you spoke
(Get me far away, get me far away...)
(Tell all your friends...)

Don't hold this against me.
I've already said I'm sorry.
(Tell all your friends about me)
Don't (Tell all your friends about me) 
hold this against me (Tell all your friends about me)
I've already said I'm sorry (Tell all your friends about me)---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
