So unpredictible, and I am so typical
I tryed to sell you a heart before you saw the world
I will sing a melody until the fluids start choking me
And when my eyes are paralyzed, I'll stare up at you my star, 
like you never knew

I'll wait for you, if you want me too,
I promise you I won't change a thing
I won't be any more, or any less
Your secret's save, I'll take to my

So unpredictible, and I'm so typical
I kept tearing away at the skin, to see what's underneath
I will sing a melody until the fluids stop choking me
And when my eyes are paralyzed, I'll stare up at you my star, 
like you never knew

I'll wait for you, if you want me too, 
I promise you I won't change a thing
I won't be any more, or any less
Your secret's save, I'll take it to my
grave

Ohh
I'll wait for you, if you want me too,
I promise you I won't change a thing
I won't be any more, or any less
Your secret's safe, I'll take it to my 
grave
