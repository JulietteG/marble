Shallow it seems 
But I need you here
From me to you 
I know I can't feel a thing
Sing me to sleep 
I won't fight it when you leave

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

Desperate it seems but I can't breathe
Are you real?
Are you real?
I can't feel a thing,
and this machine won't stop
Be here when I wake
Sing me to sleep, I won't fight it when you leave
Sing me to sleep, I won't fight it

Ohh
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here---Lyrics submitted by nigga.
