Girl, what's come between you and me
look right through me
I won't let it go
I can't help this feeling anymore
I will go anywhere
maybe you'll see me
(ohhhh)

We are
We are the shaken
We are the monsters
Underneath your bed
Yeah
Believe what you read
We are
We are mistaken
We are the voices
Inside your head
Yeah
Believe what you see

It came as no surprise
You bring me back to life
Believe me
You bleed for me
I'll bleed for you
I caught you walking through walls
Drowned with applause
From a world that makes me crazy
(ohhhh)

We are
We are the shaken
We are the monsters
Underneath your bed
Yeah
Believe what you read
We are
We are mistaken
We are the voices
Inside your head
Yeah
Believe what you see

We are the monsters
We are the monsters
We are the monsters
Underneath your bed
We are the voices
We are the voices
We are the voices
Underneath your bed
We are the monsters
We are the monsters
We are the monsters
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

We are
We are the shaken
We are the monsters
Underneath your bed
Yeah
Believe what you read
We are
We are the mistaken
We are the voices
Inside your head
Yeah
Believe what you see

We are
We are the shaken
We are the monsters
Underneath your bed
Yeah
Believe what you see---Lyrics submitted by Morten.
