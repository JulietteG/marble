Got my hair did right
Got my ladies coming for back up
Yeah the mood feels nice
I think tonight's the night it's gonna happen

I'm not a player not a hater
I'm your lover and I want your lovin'
So shortie back up baby
He's mine and I want his lovin'

I'm gonna dance dance dance (x2)
Until the cops come
(Yeah) I got my sole plan
I'm gonna get some romance, I'm gonna get some

I see you lookin' hella fine
I wish you'd come over and tell me that you want this
Don't be wasting no time 
Yeah you know I'll be your boo, I'd be your Mrs.

I'm not a player not a hater, I'm your lover and I want your lovin'
So shortie back up baby, He's mine and I want his lovin'

I'm gonna dance dance dance (x2)
Until the cops come
(Yeah) I got my sole plan
I'm gonna get some romance, I'm gonna get some

Don't want you tell me nothin' else, cause nothin' else matters, Just tonight
Don't you tell me nothing else cause nothing else matters just tonight

Just tonight (x2)

Just tonight(x2)
(I'm wanna dance dance, dance dance, dance dance
I'm gonna dance dance, dance dance, dance dance)

I'm wanna dance dance dance (x2)
Until the cops come
(Yeah) I got my silver plan
I'm gonna get some romance, I'm gonna get some

Don't want you tell me nothin' else, cause nothin' else matters, Just tonight
Don't you tell me nothing else cause nothing else matters just tonight

Just tonight x4---Lyrics submitted by ChristenBullard.
