No I never had the nerve to tell you
So Im sayin it now
Every time you walk away
I am kickin myself

And I know you dont know what you do
What you do to me
But it hurts like hell
And I know you dont know what you do
What you do to me
But it hurts like hell

I just hope that someday somebodys gonna break your heart
Gonna break your heart
And then youll finally see 
Youre gonna feel what Ive always
What Ive felt 
What Ive felt

And you can just go on and say it
I need to hear it
Itd be better for me
At least I know its stoppin you 
And Id hear the truth that I would believe

Yeah youd see the light 
and youd finally come to my side
Yeah youd see the light
and youd finally come to my side

I just hope that someday somebodys gonna break your heart
Gonna break your heart
And then youll finally see 
Youre gonna feel what Ive always
What Ive felt 
What Ive felt

And Ill tell you its not you
But they dont wanna ruin what they know
what they know
So I 
I just hope that you are gonna finally feel
What Ive always
What Ive always felt

I just hope that someday somebodys gonna break your heart
Gonna break your heart
And then youll finally see 
Youre gonna feel what Ive always felt

And theyll tell you its not you
But they dont wanna ruin what they know
What they know
So I
I just hope that you 
Youre gonna finally feel
What Ive always
What Ive always felt
