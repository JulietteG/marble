I miss you so much now I call again
Come, come tonight
Just hold me tight
This desert rain your my guiding light

We, We were lost
This world of pain
I miss you so much now I call again
Come, come tonight
Just hold me tight
This desert rain your my guiding light

We, we were lost
This walk of tide
We forgot about love, You forgot about us
Now I am here
Dreams become real

I feel like a sand that's blown away
back into the storm
I'm inside this dream
That feels just like a desert rain

We, We were lost
This world of pain
I miss you so much now I call again
Come, come tonight
Just hold me tight
This desert rain your my guiding light

We, we were lost
This walk of tide
We forgot about love, You forgot about us
Now I am here
Dreams become real

I feel like a sand that's blown away
back into the storm
I'm inside this dream
That feels just like a desert rain

You will always have my soul
Hidden dreams and secret words
Missing you

I feel like a sand that's blown away
back into the storm
I'm inside this dream
That feels just like a desert rain ---Lyrics submitted by julian jansen.
