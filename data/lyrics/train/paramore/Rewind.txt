Don't come looking for me
'Cause I'll be right here with the words you said
and looking for the words that you say
you know what you did you know
And how can anybody forget the promise that you made?
'Cause this is how a promise breaks
I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof

Rewind to the first time
that I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
that I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye

And now you're running from me
so cool, so scared of what you might have said
and no one's ever looked away,
cause we know what you did, we know
If I told anybody, they would soon forget your name
and you would never have a place
I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof

Rewind to the first time
that I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
that I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye

Please don't say too much oh, I
think we've heard enough from you,
Oh

Rewind to the first time
that I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
that I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye---Lyrics submitted by holly lolly.
