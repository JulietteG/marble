Oh no I just keep on falling
(Back to the same old...)
And where's hope when misery comes crawling?
(Oh my way, Ay...)
With your faith you'll trigger a landslide
(victory)
To kill off this common sense of mind

It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
We don't need the headlines
We just want...

(We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back)

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?

Right now you're the only reason
(I'm not letting go, oh...)
And time out if everyone's worth pleasing
(Well ha-ha!)
You'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
to kill off their finite state of mind

It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
No, we don't want your headlines
We just want...

(We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back)

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure?

Alright, so you think you're ready?
Ok, then you say this with me
Go!
We were born for this
We were born for this
Alright, so you think you're ready?
OK, then you say this with me
Go!
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this

We were born for
We were born for

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?

We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this ---
