I settle down
A twisted up frown
Disguised as a smile, well
You would have never known
I had it all but not what I wanted
'Cause hope for me was a place uncharted
And overgrown

You'd make your way in
I'd resist you just like this
You can't tell me to feel
The truth never set me free
So I did it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach a little more,
More, more, more, more.

Open your eyes like I opened mine
It's only the real world
A life you will never know
Shifting your weight to throw off the pain
Well you can ignore it
But only for so long

You look like I did
You resist me just like this
You can't tell me to heal
And it hurts remembering how it felt to shut down

You can't be to careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach a little more
More, more, more, more.

The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
So I'll do it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you 
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out!

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you 
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out!
More, more, more, more, more..---Lyrics submitted by Janisse.
