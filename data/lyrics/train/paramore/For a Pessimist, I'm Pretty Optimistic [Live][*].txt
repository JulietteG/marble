just talk yourself up
and tear yourself down
you've hit your one wall
now find a way around
well what's the problem?
you've got alot of nerve

What did you think i would say?
No you can't run away 
No you can't run away
So, what did you think i would say
No you can't run away 
no you can't run away 
You wouldn't

I never wanted to say this
you never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you
So much faith
and then you 
just threw it away
You threw it away

I'm not so naive
my sorry eyes can see
the way you fly shy
of almost everything
well if you give up
you'll get what you deserve

What did you think i would say
no you can't run away 
no you can't run away
So, what did you think i would say
no you can't run away
no you can't run away
You wouldn't

I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay 
I put my faith in you
So much faith 
and then you
just threw it away
You threw it away

You were finished long before
we had even seen the start
Why don't you stand up
be a man about it
fight with your bare hands
about it now

I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
Woah did you?
I put my faith in you
So much faith 
and then you
just threw it away

I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you
So much faith
and then you
just threw it away---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
