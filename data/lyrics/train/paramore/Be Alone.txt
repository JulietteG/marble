So what if I don't have a lot to talk about? 
I shove my mouth and keep it locked until it comes 
And what if I don't ever want to leave my house? 
Stay on the couch while all my friends are going out 

Alone 
You should be alone 
Yeah, you should be alone 
You should be alone with me 
We could be alone 
Yeah, we could be alone 
But never get too low on me 

I make the journey down the hall back to my room 
But you want time then let it ride inside in silence too 
See I ain't want to climb some social ladder too 
Some Shanghai-La's that all the cool kids will abuse 

Alone 
You should be alone 
Yeah, you should be alone 
You should be alone with me 
We could be alone 
Yeah, we could be alone 
But never get too low on me 

We could be alone together 

Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
I'm alone, now I'm in love with you alone 
Oh oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Come be alone, I'll be in love with you alone 

Oh oh oh oh oh 

You should be alone 
Yeah, you should be alone 
You should be alone with me 
We could be alone 
Yeah, we could be alone 
But never get too low on me 

You should be alone 
Yeah, you should be alone 
You should be alone with me 
We could be alone 
Yeah, we could be alone 
But never get too low on me---
