And the grass wasn't green enough here,
After watching it with my tears,
I'm not sure where you went,
Now we are just past tense.

And the snakes they're slithering in,
Chasing me to my end,
I can't say where that is,
I'm running again.

And when I get there,
It won't be far enough,
I'm a Renegade,
It's in my blood,
If ever I get there,
It won't be fast enough,
I'm a Renegade,
I always was.

And the spark never lit up a fire,
Though I tried and tried and tried,
The winds came from your lungs,
A hurricane from your tongue.

And I'll keep your secrets with me,
Right behind my teeth,
Your anger, your ankor,
But I'll sail much further on.

Ah ah oh,
Ah ah oh.

And when I get there,
It won't be far enough,
I'm a Renegade,
It's in my blood,
If ever I get there,
It won't be fast enough,
I'm a Renegade,
I always was.

(I'll keep running, I'll keep running again, running, I'll keep running),

Keep running, running, running,

(I'll keep running, I'll keep running again, running, I'll keep running),

Running, running, running.

(I'll keep running, I'll keep running again, running, I'll keep running).

And when I get there,
It won't be far enough,
I'm a Renegade,
It's in my blood,
If ever I get there,
It won't be fast enough,
I'm a Renegade,
It's in my blood,
I'm a Renegade,
I always was.---Lyrics submitted by Emma Car-Lou.
