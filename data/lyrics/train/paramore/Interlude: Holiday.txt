Now I can move on to facing
Big girl problems no more
High school drama
Graduated with honors

And I'm drinking coffee while I
Read the paper, I've been
Saving money
Eating only top ramen

Now I get a holiday
Wherever I go I must stay
I don't plan on coming back
Ever if I can hold back

Now I get a holiday
Think I'll stay
Holiday
I'll stay---
