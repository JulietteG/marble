You were my conscience
So solid now you're like water
And we started drowning
Not like we'd sink any further
But I let my heart go
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster
And eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder
How we survive?
Well, now that you're gone
The world is ours

I'm only human
I've got a skeleton in me
But I'm not the villain
Despite what you're always preaching
Call me a traitor
I'm just collecting your victims
And they're getting stronger
I hear them calling
And calling

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster
And eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder
How we survive?
Well, now that you're gone
The world is ours

Well, you thought of straight big solutions
But I like the tension
And not always knowing the answers
But you're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose it

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster
And eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder
How we survive?
Well, now that you're gone
The world...

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster
And eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder
How we survive?
Now that you're gone
The world is ours---Lyrics submitted by Eronique White.
