Can't make my own decisions or make any with precision
Well maybe you should tie me up so I don't go where you don't want me
You say that I been changing, that I'm not just simply aging
Yeah, how could that be logical?
Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat

Whoa oh oh ohhhh

You don't have to believe me, 
But the way I way I see it
Next time you point a finger, 
I might have to bend it back
Or break it break it off
(Whoa)
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror.

If God's the game that you're playing, well we must get more acquainted, 
Because it has to be so lonely
To be the only one who's holy
It's just my humble opinion
But it's one that I believe in
You don't deserve a point of view, if the only thing you see is you.

Whoa oh oh ohhhh

You don't have to believe me, 
But the way I way I see it
Next time you point a finger, 
I might have to bend it back
Or break it break it off
(Whoa)
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror.

This is the last second chance(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm Half as good as it gets(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm on both side of the fence(I'll point you to the mirror)
Without a hint of regret, I'll hold you to it

I know you don't believe me
But the way I way I see it
Next time you point a finger, 
I might have to bend it back
Or break it break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror.

I know you wont believe me
But the way I way I see it
Next time you point a finger, 
I might have to bend it back
Or break it break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror.---Lyrics submitted by Lily.
