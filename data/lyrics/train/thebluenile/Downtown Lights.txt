Sometimes I walk away, 
when all I really wanna do
Is love and hold you right,
 there is just one thing I can say
Nobody loves you this way.
It's alright, can't you see 
the downtown lights.

In love we're all the same, 
we're walking down an empty street.
And with nobody callin' on me. 
Empty streets, empty nights,
 the downtown lights.

How do I know you feel it? 
How do I know you'll feel it? 
How do I know you feel it? 
How do I know it's true?

Yeah yeah yeah yeah, it's alright.

Tonight and every night, 
lets go walking down this empty street. 
Let's walk in the cool evening light, 
be at my side.
The downtown lights. 
It will be alright. 
It will be alright. 
The downtown lights. 
Yeah yeah.

How do I know you feel it? 
How do I know you'll feel it? 
How do I know you feel it? 
How do I know it's true?

It's alright, 
it's alright,
 the downtown lights. 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
