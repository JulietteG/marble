Don't fuck with us -- BOW!

You're a hypocrite
You're so full of shit
You want everyone to just think and look and act just like you do
But we're over it
We're not giving in
And now it's time to beg forgiveness for the selfish things you do

I've got a short fuse
So don't you go p,p,p, push it man
Don't fuck with me
You better back off while you can
I got you right where I want ya
And this is how it ends
It ends with me on top, you down there at the bottom
Don't fuck with us
We're the best there ever was

So what'd you think this was?
You wanna seem dangerous?
It must be so hard for you not to seem like the coward that you are
And when it's said and done
And when you've got no one
Then you'll have to beg forgiveness for the man that you've become

(I hope you feel so disrespected)

I've got a short fuse
So don't you go p,p,p, push it man
Don't fuck with me
You better back off while you can
I got you right where I want ya
And this is how it ends
It ends with me on top, you down there at the bottom
Don't fuck with us
We're the best there ever was

We're the best there ever was
We're the best there ever was
Best there ever was, check it
If you copy 1
If you copy 2
There'll be a million motherfuckers that are just like you
But if you keep it real
And you stay true
There's nothing in this life that you can't do
C'mon!

What what what what
Get up get up
People try to hate you when you make it to the top
Just put your middle fingers up, follow your dreams and never stop
We're the best there ever was and ever will you know it's true

So bring it back and lemme hear you say
Yeahhh

I've got a short fuse
So don't you go p,p,p, push it man
Don't fuck with me
You better back off while you can
I got you right where I want ya
And this is how it ends
It ends with me on top, you down there at the bottom
Don't fuck with us
We're the best there ever was

I've got a short fuse
So don't you go p,p,p, push it man
Don't fuck with me
You better back off while you can
I got you right where I want ya
And this is how it ends
It ends with me on top, you down there at the bottom
Don't fuck with us
We're the best there ever was ---
