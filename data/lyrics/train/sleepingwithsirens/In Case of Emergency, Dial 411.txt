I can save you
If you ask me, just ask me to.
There's hope for you tonight.
I can save you
If you ask me, just ask me to.
I can save your life.

I saw you move from across the room,
I knew who you were.
You act like you are afraid of who you are,
I'm afraid for you.
Try, trust and believe in me.
I can show you that there's so much more.
There's still hope for you.
Let me show you I can save you.

I can save you
If you ask me, just ask me to.
There's hope for you tonight.
I can save you
If you ask me, just ask me to.
I can save your life.

One day you'll open your eyes, take a look inside
I just saved your life.
Just take a look inside,
I hope you know what it's like for you to be alright.
I am for you.

Don't give up just believe I will be right there,
When your hopes and your dreams are on the line.
Don't give up just believe I'll be right by your side,
When your hopes and your dreams are on the line.

I can save you
If you ask me, just ask me to.
There's hope for you tonight.
I can save you
If you ask me, just ask me to.
I can save your life.---Lyrics submitted by Alexis Giganti.
