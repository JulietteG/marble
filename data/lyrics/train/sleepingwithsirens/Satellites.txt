The fray, the friction; 
It's the reason that we all become aware. 
And we change for no reason; 
Some say it's better to fall asleep and disappear. 

And soon we'll finally look at what we've done, 
And wake up. 

So here we are, 
Waiting for a phone, 
And on the radio they're calling up satellites like they're going to save 
Us all, 
So here we are, 
I guess I'm praying after all, 
We're calling all, calling all satellites; 
This is a wake up call. 

A call for freedom; 
Ain't that the reason that we are alive? 
And we waste our lives on the wasted, 
Until there's nothing left for us to justify; 
Oh, I don't get it. 

So here we are, 
Waiting for a phone, 
And on the radio they're calling up satellites like they're going to save 
Us all, 
So here we are, 
I guess I'm praying after all, 
We're calling all, calling all satellites; 
This is a wake up call. 

Change, 
No reason; 
Some say it's better to fall asleep and disappear. 
It's time we finally opened up our eyes. 

Four, three, two... 

So here we are, 
Waiting for a phone, 
And on the radio they're calling up satellites like they're going to save 
Us all, 
So here we are, 
I guess I'm praying after all, 
We're calling all, calling all satellites; 
This is a wake up call. 

So here we are, 
Waiting for a phone, 
And on the radio they're calling all satellites...---Lyrics submitted by Savacool.
