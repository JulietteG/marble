Is it naive to make plans that seem so far away?
There's a reason I feel this way,
you're sleeping alone, I'm awake.
As you dream of me tonight, am I close to where you are?

Lay me down,
and tell me everything will be alright, things will be alright.
Lay me down,
and tell me everything will be alright. Things will be alright.
This could mean everything or nothing at all
You take what is real, I'll give you my all.

Is it naive to make plans that seem so, so, so far?
I think, "let's not wait, let's love right now.
Let's love right now."

Lay me down,
and tell me everything will be alright, things will be alright.
Lay me down,
and tell me everything will be alright. Things will be alright.

[Aaron Marsh]
Oh here where we lie, outstretched to wonder why we don't belong.
You deserve much more, and I'll give until I'm all gone.
Forever know your face and ever take your place here by my side,
like a ghost into night,
the poisoned apple to my bite.
I'll be the shadow at your door,
I'll be the moth into your light,
cause you deserve much more.
Yeah, you deserve much more.

Lay me down,
tell me everything will be alright, things will be alright.
Thunder storms could never shake us.
Lay me down and kiss me like things will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
This could mean everything or nothing at all.
You take what is real, I'll give you my all.---Lyrics submitted by Savannah.
