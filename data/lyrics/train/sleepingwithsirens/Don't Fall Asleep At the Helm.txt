I lost my heart, my home is the ocean.
The waves underneath will soon be my home.
I will fall asleep.
I'll close my eyes and dream of days when I wasn't all alone.

All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me now)
All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me)
Fall deeper and deeper, the sirens are singing your songs.

I'll miss my breath, there's no more left.
I'll miss the sound of the wind at my back.
The depths have a number, they call you by name.
Fall asleep, Davy Jones calls you.
So fall asleep, fall asleep and dream.

All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me now)
All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me)
Fall deeper and deeper, the sirens are singing your songs.---Lyrics submitted by Savannah.
