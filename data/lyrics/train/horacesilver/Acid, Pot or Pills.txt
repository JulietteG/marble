Acid, pot or pills,
Which one will help me find
All the answers to the questions
Open within my mind.
I'm in a pool of indecision
Tryin' learn how to swim.
Searching a right for lifeguard
Missure and truth from whim.

Acid, pot or pills,
Can they expend my mind
Can they really help me see things
Or do they make me blind
Where can i turn all the answers
Who can i look to for help
Is it a some kind of guidance
Keep that within myself.

So I accept delusion
Pretend that my visions keen
Waiting for kind, that blown my mind
Take me wide of the seen.
Acid, pot or pills,
Which one will lose me to
My conection with the power---Lyrics submitted by Ieva.
