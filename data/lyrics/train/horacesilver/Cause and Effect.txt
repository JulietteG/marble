Every thought, every word, every little deed,
will in time start to grow once I plant the seed.
Reapin' what I sow, shouldn't I really know, 
I am the winner and the loser, the blessed and the damned, 
the cause and effect of what I really am.

Every year, every month, every week or day, 
I must be careful of what I do and say. 
Reapin' what I sow shouldn't I really know, 
I am the winner and the loser, the blessed and the damned, 
the cause and effect of what I really am.

I am the jury. I am the judge.
What will my verdict be?
Shall I go on and sentence myself, 
or shall I set me free?

Every rock, every stone, every little weed, 
if I don't cast them out they will kill the seed.
Reapin' what I sow, shouldn't I really know, 
I am the winner and the loser, the blessed and the damned, 
the cause and effect of what I really am.---Lyrics submitted by Frank Quaglia.
