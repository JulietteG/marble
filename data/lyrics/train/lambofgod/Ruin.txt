The knowledge the seeking the favour of another
Is the murder of self.
This is the resolution
The end of all progress
The death of evolution; it bleeds all life away.
Silence speeds the path to the streams of solace..
That run so few and narrow
Brooks that babble the sounds of torture the sounds of torture
You will one day rise
To flood the banks of the chosen
This is the art of ruin
This is the resolution
The end of all progress
The death of evolution
It bleeds all life away (x2)
I will show you all that I have mastered.
Fear. Pain. Hatred. Power.
This is the art of ruin. (x3)---Lyrics submitted by SanDames.
