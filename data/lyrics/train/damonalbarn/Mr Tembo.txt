Injili, Injili
Can I sing with you
'Bout Mr. Tembo and what he's got to do
But first I'm going back
To the Colworth Road
To find the mission
And help him with his load

Mr. Tembo is on his way up the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he planned
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he planned

Injili, Injili
We will sing with you
Just like the T.V
In Mr. Tembo's room
Off the emphatic night
He checked in on his own
At Mkombozi Inn and
Made it his home

Mr. Tembo is on his way up the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he planned
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he planned

Injili, Injili
We will sing to you
'Bout Mr. Tembo
And what he's going through
Gets up early
While you are still in bed
Mr. Tembo, green blanket by his head

Mr. Tembo is on his way up the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he planned
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he planned

Hey, you keep those lions off the front of the boat!
Good God, man! Have you some cotton in your ears?!
I'm trying to run this expedition in a decent manner!

Logistics, haulage, golf, bungalows, spires, canals, cows, hay bales
Telegraph wires, pylon power
Farmhouse over chimneys still used
Stone, satellites, football pitches, faded flags and lots of dogs
Neon cross on top of a block of flats, and a church, not as usual

Mr. Tembo is on his way up the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he planned
It's where he is now but it wasn't what he planned---
