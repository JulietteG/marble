stuck in the middle 
i borrow inside
back to the cradle

away from the burdens
of all my crimes
before its straight on

the past has found me
the truths come out
all is rememerd

no place to fall 
but straight down
 i will remember

and it seems 
i finally thought of everything
i wanna love
i wanna feel
i find peace
i find the real

its the face i put on all my life
face of an angel
look in the mirror only to find
face of a stranger

lord i've taken
hungry for more
cause i selfisf
and all i'm left with
is a crown of thorns
and i'm helpless

and it seems i finally 
thought of everything
i wanna love 
i wanna feel
ifind peace 
i find the real

i'll trade these for somthing right
i will kill all that hurts with something pure
i will be redeemed
so i can breath again---Lyrics submitted by space.
