I have played the part
I have all but lost my soul
And I have sacrificed
For what it's worth, I just don't know


In the silence of my heart there is a distant call
yeah
It beckons me to stand apart


So I'll set out on my own just to breathe again
Touch the light that calls me home just to reach the end
Where I'm free to breathe again


Through the suffering, through the misery and pain
Never anything, but the will to see the day
Yeah
When the promise might be born light the spark within
Yeah
Cause I can't take it anymore


So I'll set out on my own just to breathe again
Touch the light that calls me home just to reach the end
Where I'm free to breathe again


I am free to roam and set out on my own
To rise above the hands that try to hold me down
Before the end I know I'll breath again to find my way


So I'll set out on my own just to breathe again
Touch the light that calls me home just to reach the end
I'm leaving today
I'm leaving today
I'm leaving today---Lyrics submitted by Craig.
