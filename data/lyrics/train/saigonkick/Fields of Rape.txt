There is danger in the fields of rape
Not too far from where you walk
There is danger on the path you take
Too late
You've gone too far

There's meaning in these words of hate
Hidden, yet to find
There's children behind an iron gate
Hiding
Swollen eyes

Change these fields of rape
Wash them away
Like the morning rain
On your face

We gotta change these fields of rape
Take me away from
The burning pain
Of this place

There is hunting in the fields of rape
And we've become the game
There is running in the fields of rape
Abolish all mankind

There is crying on the African soil and
Life is hard to keep
There is dying in a Bosnian town
A girl
Of just sixteen

Change these fields of rape
Wash them away
Like the morning rain
On your face

We gotta change these fields of rape
Take me away from 
The burning pain
Of this place---Lyrics submitted by Kristy.
