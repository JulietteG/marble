Yea, you've been alone
i've been gone for far to long
but with all that we've been through
after all this time I'm coming home to you

never let it show
the pain i've grown to know
cause with all these thing we do
it don't matter when I'm coming home to you

I reach towards the sky, I've said my goodbyes
my hearts always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
my prayers have made it through

cause with all these things we do it don't matter when I'm coming home to you

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH YEAH YEAH

Letters keep me warm
help me through the storm
but with all that we've been through
after all this time I'm coming home to you

I reach towards the sky, I've said my goodbyes
my hearts always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
my prayers have made it through, yea

cause with all these things we do
it don't matter when I'm coming home to you

I've always been true
I've waited so long just to come hold you
I'm making it through
It's been far to long
We've proven a love over time so strong
in all that we do
the stars in the night
they lend me their light
to bring me closer to heaven with you

but with all that we've been through
after all this time I'm coming home to you

I reached towards the sky
I've said my goodbyes
my heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
my prayers have made it through

cause with all these things we do 
it don't matter when I'm coming home to you
and with all that we've been through
after all this time I'm coming home to you---Lyrics submitted by Nick.
