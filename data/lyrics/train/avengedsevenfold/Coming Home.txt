I've been away
Searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas
Fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in hell
Where many had to suffer
I stabbed the devil in the eyes

Walked many roads
To witness ancient idols
And found the great Gates of fire

Had many stones
Question my conviction
Gave on these reason to rise?

The hate I'm searching 
For bones he can borrow
while eyes gift in the night?
Final plight

Live again
I won't sin 
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

Escape the hell
Of capitulated mortals
And drink the blood of a king
A desert rain
has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me
So it seems

Live again
I won't sin 
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

(Guitar Solo)

My story ends
Not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world
Through the eyes of a known man
Home is where the heart is
I've been told
So I go

Live again
I won't sin
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
