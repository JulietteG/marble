Lived through you,
Safe with how we lived our lives,
With how it all turned out.
(But things are bound to change)
Uncovered lies, surfaced throughout,
Will make you change your mind

Sometimes life is altered.
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right

When I see you, I can read it in your eyes,
Fate misunderstood.
(But things are bound to change)
Swallowed the lies, can't blame you for,
Thinking with your heart.

Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right

I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
I know, I know.
Dark will turn to light, in time I'll be alright
I know, I know
(I never imagined my life could turn out this way
So cold so black so alone)

Living goes by fast, catch your breath
And it will pass you by.
And it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold.

Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right

Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
(yeah)
Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right---Lyrics submitted by Teddy Barlow.
