Chances are like night disappeared
Caught in the atmosphere
Where you go, she casts no shadow
Still you know she's near

Lie

Here she comes, all parts of everything
Stars in the motherhand
With the dark, thunder above you
Come to a song, we...

Lie
Lie

Chances are
10: 37
House made of the dawn
Disappears

Lie
