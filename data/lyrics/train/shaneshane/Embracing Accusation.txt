The father of lies
 Coming to steal
 Kill and destroy
 All my hopes of being good enough
 I hear him saying cursed are the ones
 Who cant abide
 Hes right
 Alleluia hes right!

The devil is preaching
 The song of the redeemed
 That I am cursed and gone astray
 I cannot gain salvation
 Embracing accusation

Could the father of lies
 Be telling the truth
 Of God to me tonight?
 If the penalty of sin is death
 Then death is mine
 I hear him saying cursed are the ones
 Who cant abide
 Hes right
 Alleluia hes right!

Oh the devils singing over me
 An age old song
 That I am cursed and gone astray
 Singing the first verse so conveniently
 Hes forgotten the refrain
 Jesus saves!---Lyrics submitted by amyk wheat.
