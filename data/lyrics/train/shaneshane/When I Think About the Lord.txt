When I think about the Lord
How He saved me, how He raised me
How He filled me with the Holy Ghost
How He healed me to the uttermost
When I think about the Lord
How He picked me up, turned me around
How He set my feet on solid ground

That makes me wanna shout
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!
Lord, you're worthy
Of all the glory, of all the honor, of all the praise!

That makes me wanna shout
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!
Lord, you're worthy
Of all the glory, and all the honor, and all the praise!

When I think about the Lord
How He saved me, how He raised me

How He picked me up, turned me around
How He set my feet on solid ground

That makes me wanna shout
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!
Lord, you're worthy
Of all the glory and all the honor and all the praise!

That makes me wanna shout
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!
Lord, you're worthy
Of all the glory and all the honor and all the praise!
And all the praise!
And all the praise!

Hallelujah! thank you, Jesus!
Lord, you're worthy
of all the glory, and all the honor
and all the praise!---Lyrics submitted by roselynyanson.
