I believe in fairy tales
In magic spells and wishing wells
And pirate sails
and once I thought I'd never fall in love
Thats shows how much i knew
And i believed in Superman
In santa claus the world of Oz
And wonderland
But one by one those fantasies have failed
While you keep shining through
I still believe in you

( Chorus:)

I could never doubt your kiss
No one other love fells me like this
If you take a chance, you'll see
I believe in you
Believe in me 

Other dreams may turn to dust 
But I don't care, If you'll be there
I'll always trust
Cause I believe with all my heart and soul
This dream we share is true
And still believe in you---Lyrics submitted by Katherine.
