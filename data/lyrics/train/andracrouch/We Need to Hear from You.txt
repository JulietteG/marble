Chorus:
We need to hear from you
We need a word from you
If we don't hear from you
What will we do
Wanting you more each day
Show us your perfect way
There is no other way
That we can live

(Repeat Chorus)

Leader:
Destruction is now is now in view
Seems the world has forgotten all about you
Children are crying and people are dying
They're lost without you, so lost without you
But you said if we seek
Lord if we seek your face
And turn from our wicked, our wicked ways
(Choir) You promised to heal our land
(Choir) Father you can

(Repeat Chorus)
(Repeat Chorus)
(Repeat Chorus)

There is no other way
There is no other way
There is no other way
That we can live---Lyrics submitted by courtney robins.
