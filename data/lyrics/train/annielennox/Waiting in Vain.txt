From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, boy 
My heart said follow through
But I know now that I'm way down on your line 
But the waiting feeling's fine So don't treat me like a puppet on a string 
Because I know how to do my thing 
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gotta come, you see 

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love 
'Cause summer is here - and I'm still waiting there
Winter is here - and I'm still waiting there 

Like I said -
It's been three years since I'm knocking on your door
And still I can knock some more 
Ooh boy, ooh boy - is it crazy look, I wanna know now 
For I to knock some more
You see

In life I know that there is lots of grief
But your love is my relief 
Tears in my eyes burn 
Tears in my eyes burn 
While I'm waitin' 
While I'm waitin' for my turn
You see 

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love 
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

'Cause summer is here - and I'm still waiting there
Winter is here - and I'm still waiting there 

Like I said -
I don't wanna, I don't wanna 
I don't wanna, I don't wanna 
I don't wanna wait in vain 
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna wait in vain

It's been three years since I'm knocking on your door 
And still I can knock some more 
Ooh boy, ooh boy - is it crazy look, I wanna know now 

Like I said -
Tears in my eyes burn 
Tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting 
While I'm waiting for my turn
You see
Ooh boy, ooh boy - is it crazy look, I wanna know now 
For I to knock some more
In life I know there is lots of grief 
But your love is my relief---Lyrics submitted by Polly.
