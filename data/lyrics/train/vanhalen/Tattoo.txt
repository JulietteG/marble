Tattoo, tattoo

I got Elvis on my elbow
and when I flex Elvis talks
I got hula girls on the back of my leg
and she hulas when I walk

Speak in cherry red
Screaming electric green
Purple mountain's majesty really talk to me
Talk to me babe

Swap-Meet Sally
Tramp-stamp Tat
Mousewife to Momshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo
Tattoo-tattoo

(Tattoo, tattoo)
Show me your dragon magic
(Tattoo, tattoo)
So autobiographic!

Best believe that need will hurt you
Best deceive these true colors that follow one of your false virtues

Here's a secret to make you think
Why is the crazy stuff we never said poetry in ink
Speak in day-glow red
Explodo paint
Purple mountain's majesty show me you, I'll show you me

Swap-Meet Sally
Trampstamp Tat
Mousewife to Momshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo, tattoo-tattoo

Woo!
(Tattoo, tattoo)
Sexy dragon magic
(Tattoo, tattoo)
So very autobiographic!
(Tattoo, tattoo)
Got a hold on me
(Tattoo, tattoo)
You put a spell on meeeee!

Uncle Danny had a coal tattoo
He fought for the unions
Some of us still do
On my shoulder is a number of the Chapter he was in
That number is forever like the struggle here to win

Everybody!
Swap-Meet Sally
Trampstamp Tat
Mousewife to Momshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo, tattoo-tattoo
Tattoo
ta-too!

(Tattoo, tattoo)
Sexy dragon magic
(Tattoo, tattoo)
So very autobiographic!
(Tattoo, tattoo)
You got a hold on me
(Tattoo, tattoo)
You put a spell on me
(Tattoo, tattoo)
I'm in love with you
(Tattoo, tattoo)
Show me, show me your
(Tattoo, tattoo)
Look at me, look at you!
(Tattoo, tattoo)
