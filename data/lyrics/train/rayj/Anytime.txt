[Verse 1:]
Yeah you know what this is
You granted all my wishes
And damn it im gon miss it if we fade away
I don't wanna be down
Lovin' you i have found
Girl i want u around
Always...

Don't you believe that
Nobody needs you cuz i do
I need all of you baby
If u can see that
Nobody needs you like i do

[Chorus:]
Anytime im needin someone
I think of u for comfort, can u feel me?
Anytime ur feelin down or
Need a friend for comfort, can u feel me?

[Verse 2:]

Anytime ur feelin down or
Need a friend for comfort, can u feel me?

[Verse 3:]
Ain't no way ill ever be thru with u
Baby let me know if we can make it
Cuz i wanna be there, baby can i be there?
Anywhere i dont care

[Chorus x3:]
Anytime im needin someone
I think of u for comfort, can u feel me?
Anytime ur feelin down or
Need a friend for comfort, can u feel me?

Girl, whenever im down i think of u to lift me up
And if u ever need a friend 
If you ever need someone to talk to
I'm right here...
I'll never leave
I love you
