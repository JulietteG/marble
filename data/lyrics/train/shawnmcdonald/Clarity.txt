Well Im just a simple man with a simple plan trying to find my way home
And this dusty, dirty way with nothing left to say I stagger and I roam
And Im tired and Im worn and my clothes are kinda torn 
from this long hard road
And my arms and legs are weak as I continue to seek and leave behind this load

I need clarity, truth to be, peace to make me whole
I want freedom to come and hate to be done 
and love to guide my soul
I want love, yeah, I want love

Standing on the battle line I fight for my mind aching to be free
And this war that I face as I long to embrace and be with my King
And this fire in my soul, desire to be whole is deep within my bones
And I long to be near as I cast away the fear, running for Your throne

I want clarity, truth to be, peace to make me whole
I want freedom to come and hate to be done 
and love to guide my soul
Yeah I want love, yeah, I want love---Lyrics submitted by Brandon.
