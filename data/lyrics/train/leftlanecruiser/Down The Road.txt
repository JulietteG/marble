Adventurers in time and space, transcribed in future tense; Dimension X.

Run down the road
Blood on your shoes.
Hate in your heat now, darlin' 'cause 
you've got the blues.
Wake in the mornin'	
Breath in the air
Back is broke now, darlin' but you Don't care.
You don't care.

Wake in the mornin'
Breath in the air.
Feel like I need you darlin' but I don't dare.
I don't dare.

Yeah, I been down hard yeah baby
Feelin' like a chump.
I need some lovin' woman won't you give me some?
You don't care.
You don't care. 

Run down the road
Blood on your shoes.
Hate in your heat now, darlin' 'cause 
you've got the blues.
Wake in the mornin'	
Breath in the air
Back is broke now, darlin' but you Don't care.
You don't care.---Lyrics submitted by DooM.
