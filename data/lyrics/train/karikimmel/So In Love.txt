Forbidden love I dont care, 
I dont care what anybody
thinks as long as you
are here with me, 
here with me.

Where do we go from
here I dont know 
youre the only what I want
the only one, were so
meant to be. 

Im ready to jump, Im never going under
I need you I cant wait any longer ooh oh
Im so oh in love. 

Incapable of failing, I know that we will last,
taking every risk come taking every chance 
ooh oh Im so oh in 

la la la la love. (3x)

Destiny has brought us here 
oh I cant believe 
how much I feel
seems like a dream. 

It must be fate,
something bigger than us that
brought me here, its obvious
were so meant to be. 

Im ready to jump, Im never going under
I need you I cant wait any longer ooh oh
Im so oh in love. 

Incapable of failing, I know that we will last,
taking every risk come taking every chance 
ooh oh Im so oh in 

la la la la love. (3x)

Weve changed the course of time
oh, everythings so bright its perfect, kiss me.

Everyting for love we do it all
because were meant to be

la la la love. (3x) 

Im ready to jump, Im never going under
I need you I cant wait any longer ooh oh
Im so oh in love. 

Incapable of failing, I know that we will last,
taking every risk come taking every chance 
ooh oh Im so oh in 

la la la la love. (3x)

Were meant to be together 

la la la la love. 

Im so oh in love.---Lyrics submitted by Leaila Roche.
