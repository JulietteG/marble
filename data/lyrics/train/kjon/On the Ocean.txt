Man,the moment i been waiting on,and my soul is over flowing with anxieties and expectations full of desires,i just want it so bad you know and it just seem so real its right there just want to reach out and touch it before it all disappears

sometimes it feels like everything is passin me by 
every now and then it feels like {feels like} 
my ship has gone and sailed away 
but I, i gotta be strong {gotta be strong} gotta hold on
it wont be too long 

chorus: now the tide is coming near i see the waves flowin
out there on the ocean i know my ship is coming in 
just past the horizon and right where the sky ends
cause out there on the ocean i know my ship is coming in
so dont leave me hanging i been waitin too long
for this moment my ship has finally come

i would travel to the seven seas 
i would even go wherever the wind blows me
ill do anything to find my destiny
its like fightin with gravity and its bringin me down
if this world was really round then tell me how
it took so long for you to come around

chorus: now the tide is coming near i see the waves flowin
out there on the ocean i know my ship is coming in 
just past the horizon and right where the sky ends
cause out there on the ocean i know my ship is coming in
so dont leave me hanging i been waitin too long
for this moment my ship has finally come

finally you come {around} around around
i said finally baby finally you come around around
finally you come around come around baby
said finally you've come around 

chorus:now the tide is coming near i see the waves flowin
out there on the ocean i know my ship is coming in 
just past the horizon and right where the sky ends
cause out there on the ocean i know I know I know I know I know I know
it's coming in been waiting too long for this moment my ship has finally come---Lyrics submitted by Regina.
