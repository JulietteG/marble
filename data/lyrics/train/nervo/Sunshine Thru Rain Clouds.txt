(feat. Duane Harden)

All of the people gone together
To sunshine and rain clouds
Here we go

Sunshine thru rain clouds
Takes me away to a place
I rather be with you

Sunshine thru rain clouds
Takes me away to a place
I rather be with you

Sunshine thru rain clouds
Takes me away to a place
I rather be with you

Sunshine thru rain clouds
Takes me away to a place
I rather be with you

Sunshine

Sunshine thru rain clouds
Takes me away to a place
I rather be with you

Sunshine thru rain clouds
Takes me away to a place
I rather be with you

Take away the rain now
Take away the rain now

Sunshine

Sunshine---
