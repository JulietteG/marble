The crimson tide is flowing through your
fingers as you sleep
the promise of a clean regime are
promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask and
are you up to task?
The calicos of pettibon
where cultures come to clash

Several of my best friends wear
the colors of the crown
and Mary wants to build it up
and sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl 
the savior of your light 
the monarchy of roses 
the monarchy of roses tonight

The cross between my former queen
her legendary stare 
the holy tears of Ireland
the lovely cross to bear

Several of my best friends know
the secrets of this town 
and Mary wants to raise it up
and Sherry wants to spin it all around, girl 
the sailors of the night 
the monarchy of roses 
the monarchy of roses tonight

Several of my best friends wear
the colors of the crown 
and Mary wants to fill it up
and Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl 
the savior of your light 
the monarchy of roses 
the monarchy of roses 

Hey yeah 
we all want the rose you know 
I said 
hey yeah 
show us love before you go 
say I will
and then I'll say I want to 
the story of love
that I will never taunt you

Hey yeah 
we all want the rose you know 
I said 
hey yeah 
show us love before you go 
say I will
and then I'll say I want to 
the story of love
that I will always want you 
hey---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.
