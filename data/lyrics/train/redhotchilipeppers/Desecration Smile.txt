All alone not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I've seen it all thru someone else
(Another girl bad for my health)

Celebrated but undisturbed
Serenaded by the terror bird
It's seldom seen and it's never heard
(Serenaded by the terror bird)

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face my face

Disintegrated by the rising sun
A rolling blackout of oblivion
And I like to think that I'm your number one
(a rolling blackout of oblivion)

I wanna leave but I just get stuck
A broken record runnin' low on luck
There's heavy metal coming from your truck
I'm a (a broken record runnin' low on luck)

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face my face

We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice she enjoys
We could all come up with something new to be destroyed
We could all go down

I love the feeling when it falls apart
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
And I'm(Slow to finish but quick to start)

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face my face---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
