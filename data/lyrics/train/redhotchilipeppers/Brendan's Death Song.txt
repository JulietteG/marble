If I die,
before I get it done.
Will you decide?

To take my words,
and turn them into signs.
They will survive.

Because, a long time ago,
I knew not to deprive.

It's safe out there, and
now you're everywhere.
Just like the skies.

And, you are love,
you are the love supreme.
You are the rise.

And when you hear this,
you'll know it's your jam,
it's your good-bye.

Ch: 
Like I said,
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone.
And, when the drummer drums,
he's gonna play my song,
to carry me along.
Like I said,
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone.
And, when the boatman comes
to ferry me away,
to where we all belong.

We are cross,
when we were feeling lost,
It's just a time.

Kutari cried,
the day her lover died,
she recognized.

Because he gave her,
a life of real love,
it's no surprise.

The nights are long,
but the years are short,
when you're alive.

Way back when,
will never be again,
it was a time.

It's gonna catch you,
so glad I met you,
to walk the line.

Ch: 1x

hey,         hey,         yeah,         yeah,       yeah...

Ch: 1x

...Let me live,
so when it's time to die,
even the reaper cries.
Let me die,
so when it's time to live,
another son will rise.

said yeah,      yeah,       yeah...
said yeah,      yeah,       yeah...

Ch: 1x

...like I said,
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone

...like I said,
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone

...like I said,
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone...---Lyrics submitted by aaron shepard.
