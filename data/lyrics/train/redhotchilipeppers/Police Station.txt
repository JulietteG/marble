I saw you at the police station and it breaks my heart to say 
Your eyes had wondered off your something mystical and gray 
I guess you didn't see it coming 
Someone's has gotten used to slumming
I dreamin' of the golden years
I see you had change careers
Far away
But we both know it's somewhere

I saw you on the back page of some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eye said nothing short of love for pay
I know you from another picture 
With someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fooled around and pulled some capers 
Not today
Send the message to her
A message that I'm coming, 
Coming to pursue her 
Damn her conscience rest her place on your bed 
I got ya ten times over I'll
Chase you down till your dead

I saw you on a tv station and it made me wanna prey
An empty shell of loveliness is now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper 
Smiling was ya money maker
Someone ought to situate her 
Find a way to educate her
All the way
Time to come and find you
You can't hide from me girl
so never mind what I do
Tell her conscience it's my best on your bed
l met my soul and a she and I let it up over your head

I saw you in the church out there there was no time to exchange
You were getting married and it felt so very strange
I guess you didn't see it coming 
And now I guess it's me who's bumming
Dreamn' of the golden years
You and where mixing tears
Not today
Not for me but someone
I never could get used to
So now I will refuse to
damn her conscience rest my place on your bed
I met my soul enough she and I left it up on your head
I got my best bet for (wa da na)
chase you down till your dead---Lyrics submitted by dosyboxy.
