Junior paints that old cafe
he's gotta chase those girls around
westbound drunk with lots to say
but he never makes a sound 

Hustlers get what they deserve 
but it's always half the date
good things come to those who wait
like an expiration date

See you around
I'll see you around 
I'll play all night
hey don't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll play all night
hey don't get uptight
see you, so long
goodbye, hooray

Curb your tongue oh scallywag
because you got no flag to wave 
save your breath for the black and white 
every dog will have it's day

See you around
I'll see you around 
I'll play all night
hey don't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray 
well I'll see you around
I'll see you around, 
I'll play all night
hey don't get uptight
see you, so long,
goodbye, hooray

Well I'll see you around
I'll see you around

I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll play all night
hey don't get uptight 
I lead all your mind games astray 
well I'll see you around
I'll see you around 
I'll play all night
hey don't get uptight
see you, so long
goodbye, hooray

Well I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll see you around 
I'll see you around 
goodbye and hooray 

Well I'll see you around
I'll see you around---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.
