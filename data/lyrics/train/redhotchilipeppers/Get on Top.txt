Get on top
Get on top

Hit me
Come get me
I bite but
She bit me

Gorilla
Cuntilla
I bite but
She bit me
Sammy D and salmonella
Come with me cause I'm an ass killer
You're ill but
I'm iller

I'll malinger on your block and 
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock and
Set you up to get on top

Complications of a mastermind
Last temptations of my kind
Extra-planetary sign
When do we align
All in time

Right on

Get up
Come sit up
I light but
She lit up

Grasshopper
Showstopper
The life of a wife swapper
Come with me cause I'm a big bopper
You do but
I wopper

Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me feel with painted claws

Complications of a mastermind
Last temptations of my kind
Extra-planetary sign
When do we align
All in time

Right on

Get on top
Get on top

Hit me
Come get me
I bite but
She bit me

Speedballer
Rhodes scholar
Bottom bitch and a
Call a dollar
Come with me because I'm a free faller
You hoot but 
I holler

I'll malinger on your block and 
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock and
Set you up to get on top

Get on top
Get on top
Get on top
Get on top---Lyrics submitted by Liz.
