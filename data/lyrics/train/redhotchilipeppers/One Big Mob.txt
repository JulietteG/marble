I am you are me
Good woman said you gotta believe
Submerge into the urge of we
Deliciously the mystery

One big mob aw yea aw yea
One big mob aw yea aw yea
Eh bara mala aw yea aw yea
Eh bara mala aw yea aw yea

Ooze into into my noodle
East or west shepherd or poddle
Lady bug pinetree
To mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun
And a brother to the cool breeze

Chorus :
Scrawled upon the wall
Of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note
That spoke to all

One two buckle my shoe
Take care of me
Cause I might be you

We live in the city
We live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking
A thimble humble
Everything you ever see
Is never more than you and me
Give it on into the beauty of the mystery

One big mob in one big home
A broken home
I'd like to share some air with you
Some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives
to give and give
What was I thinking in my head
The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost
A sullen cost
Picaboo street in Timbuktu
Do I need repeat
That a boy named Sue ?
Rockin' to the beat
Of the kangaroo
Let me kiss your feet
And your forehead too---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
