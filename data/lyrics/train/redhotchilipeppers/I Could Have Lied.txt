There must be something
In the way I feel
That she dont want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me
I dont care
You see so what if I bleed

I could never change
Just what I feel
My face will never show
What is not real

A mountain never seems to have
The need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling
I got from you
The things I said to you were true

I could never change
Just what I feel
My face will never show
What is not real

I could have lied Im such a fool
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but Im fucked up now

But now shes gone yes shes gone away
A soulful song
That would not stay
You see she hides cause she is scared
But I dont care
I wont be spared

I could have lied Im such a fool
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but Im fucked up now

I could have lied Im such a fool
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but Im fucked up now---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
