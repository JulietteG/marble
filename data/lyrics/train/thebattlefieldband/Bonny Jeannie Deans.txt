This is the story o the Bonny Jeannie Deans
She was a paddle steamer built in Goven
She left her shilkeigh in 1931
To serve at Regan Doren 
Throughout her days on the firthful Clyde
She plied her tread with grace and charm
She won the hearts of sailin' men
Fre attica te addin

Chorus:
And she would waltz around the kiles 
Her paddles turnin'
The waters churnin'
As brow as Zonnie o de Queens
She was the Bonny Jeannie Deans

My name is William Geddis
I was once her engineer
They said for fun that I would grace the seagulls
I telt the captain the Jeannie was a star
So he challenged all her rivals
She took 'em on and outran them all
And brought me joy and great satisfaction
I telt the firemen te leave the coal
And join the celebration

Chorus

On summer days ye'd often see her sail
The coastal waters as far as Patty's Milestone
Her mighty engines were always polished fine
And perpetually in motion
In winter time she would be repaired
And painted up 'ore the comin' season
And in the springtime she'd reappear
steaming out to the horizon

Chorus

The day arrived upon the firthful Clyde
The Jeannie Deans made her last departure
She went to London and then she was retired
Te antenon and the breakers
The Jeannie Deans may well be gone
But she's remembered and all the harbors
Will never see her likes again
Come sailin' on these waters

And she would waltz around the kiles 
Her paddles turnin'
The waters churnin'
As brow as Zonnie o de Queens
(As Zonnie o de Queens)
She was the Bonny Jeannie Deans---Lyrics submitted by Panda Master.
