I will bring you roses
California roses
If you need it you can have my soul
Gonna keep you dancin'
Laughin' and a--dancin'
Like it's Louisiana rock and roll

We'll build a house and we'll not put a lock on the door
Keep an open heart and we won't be alone anymore

I will bring you roses
California roses
If you need it you can have my soul
Gonna keep you dancin'
Laughin' and a--dancin'
Like it's Louisiana rock and roll---Lyrics submitted by CRYSTAL B.
