Our Love, is an old love, baby
It's older than all our years
I've seen in strange young eyes, familiar tears.

We're old souls in a new life, baby
They gave us a new life to live and learn
some time to touch old friends and still return

Our paths have crossed and parted
This love affair was started long, long ago

This love's survived the ages
In it's story lives are pages
Fill them up, may ours turn slow.

Our love is a strong love, baby
we give it all and still receive.
and so with empty arms we must still believe

Old souls last forever
so we need never fear good-bye
A kiss when I must go, no tears. 
In time we'll kiss hello.---Lyrics submitted by Celia.
