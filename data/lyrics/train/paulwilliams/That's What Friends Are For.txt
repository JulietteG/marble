Friends are like music
Sometimes they're sad
Sometimes they're lonely
And need to be told that they're loved
Everyone needs to be loved

Friends are like good wine
And I've had the best
Don't always show it
But no one knows better than I

So drink up
I'm a homesick old sailor
Who longs for the sound of his own front door
Tell me your stories
I'll teach you my songs
And we'll have one more
Isn't that what friends are for
Isn't that what friends are for

Friends are like warm clothes
In the night air
Best when they're old
And we miss them the most when they're gone
Miss them the most when they're gone
Friends love your good side
And live with your bad
Want you and need you
When no one else knows you're alive

So drink up
I'm a homesick old sailor
Who longs for the sound of his own front door
Tell me your stories
I'll teach you my songs
And we'll have one more
Isn't that what friends are for
Isn't that what friends are for---Lyrics submitted by CRYSTAL B.
