You have beautiful eyes
But they blind me like the big blue skies
And your big heart
Seduce me once gain
And may the ways of this
Big world be good to you
You're leaving

When you go little girl
It's gonna tear my world apart
Gotta let you go little girl
So we can grow
You're leaving, you're leaving, don't go

And may the fairness
Of your skin never seduce me
Seduce me again
So you can know
What I believe in, what I believe in
Believe in you

When you go little girl
It's gonna tear my insides out
Gotta let you go, little girl
So we can grow
You're leaving, you're leaving
Don't go, don't go
Don't want you to go now

You're leaving
You're leaving
You're leaving
Don't want you to go now
Don't want you to go now
Don't go little girl
So that you can know
So that you can know
What I believe in
What I believe in
Believe in you
Don't go
Don't go
You're leaving
Don't go ---Lyrics submitted by Bela Beeson.
