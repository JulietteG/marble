It's such a long way down
Down from the high
You're like the lonely sound
I can't deny

I didn't know I was feelin' blest
Till' you had me fallin'
It's such a long way down
Down from the high

You're running through my veins
Fire up
Dance in a crowd
Like my heart can never beat without you now
Now you're gone
Can anybody tell me how
to break

Habit of you

Cause now i'm feelin' for you
You left me longin' for you
I'm down here beggin' for you
Yes I can't give you up
Junkie, I'm like a Junkie

Cause now i'm feelin' for you
I'm strung out on your love
You left me longin' for you
Like I can't get enough
I'm down here beggin' for you
Guess I can't give you up
Junkie, I'm like a Junkie

Junkie
I'm like a Junkie
Junkie
Junkie
I'm like a Junkie

There's nothin' I want more
Then to leave you behind
If I could close this door
And watch us die

You're running through my veins
Fire up
Dance in a crowd
Like my heart can never beat without you now
Now you're gone
Can anybody tell me how
To break, to break, to break

Habit of you

Cause now i'm feelin' for you
I'm strung out on your love
You left me longin' for you
Like I can't get enough
I'm down here beggin' for you
Guess I can't give you up
Junkie, I'm like a Junkie

Cause now i'm feelin' for you
You left me longin' for you
I'm down here beggin' for you
Yes I can't give you up
Junkie, I'm like a Junkie

Junkie, Junkie, I'm like a Junkie---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
