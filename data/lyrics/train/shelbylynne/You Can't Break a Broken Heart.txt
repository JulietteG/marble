It wont be so easy
This time to hurt me
You can try
This time now, baby,
There are no tears left here to dry

If you think you can ruin me like before
If you think you can do that anymore
Wont get too far, no
You cant break a broken heart

(Chorus)
So try your best now baby
Try your best to break me
You cant break a broken heart
No damage you can do now
Im immune to you now
You cant break what broke apart

Theres nothing you can do to me no more
You cant break a broken heart

You hurt me before, now
Wont hurt no more, now
Not this time
You might do better
Messing with someone elses mind

Cause youre not gonna break me down again
Youre done with doing me the way you did
Its gone too far, yeah
You cant break a broken heart

(Chorus)
So try your best now baby
Try your best to break me
You cant break a broken heart
No damage you can do now
Im immune to you now
You cant break what broke apart

Theres nothing you can do to me no more
You cant break a broken heart

So dont waste your time
Your time has come and gone
What are you here for?
You cant hurt me anymore

(Chorus)
So try your best now baby
Try your best to break me
You cant break a broken heart
No damage you can do now
Im immune to you now
You cant break what broke apart

Theres nothing you can do to me no more
You cant break a broken heart

(Chorus)
So try your best now baby
Try your best to break me
You cant break a broken heart
No damage you can do now
Im immune to you now
You cant break what broke apart

Theres nothing you can do to me no more
You cant break a broken heart
