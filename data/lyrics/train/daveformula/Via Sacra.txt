It's the year dot 
One beautiful day after the future
Yes this is the future
The future today

Oblivion went to all this trouble
Oblivion on the sacred way
Oblivion went to, to all this trouble
Oblivion on the sacred way

Love, love
Love, love
Opposite of power

I hate this wonderful place
This terrible place (terrible)

Love, love 
Opposite of power
Love, love 
It's the opposite of power
Love, love 
Opposite of power
Love, love 
It's the opposite of power

I hate this wonderful place (wonderful)
This terrible place (terrible)
I love---Lyrics submitted by Maggi G.
