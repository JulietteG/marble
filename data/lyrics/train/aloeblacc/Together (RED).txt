Hold my hand so we don't slip on the rocks
They say the mountain is so hard to climb
And the valley steep to go
Together is better than 1

They say the mountain is so hard to climb
And the valley steep to go
Together is better than 1

Hand in hand we will get to the top
Hand in hand we will run down the valley
Hand in hand we shall overcome
Together is better than 1

Every man needs a a hand to hold
No matter how strong he may be
Lean on me and I lean on you
Together is better than 1
