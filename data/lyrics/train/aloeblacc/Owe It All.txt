Where will I be without the pillow on my bed
Where will I be without the roof over my head
I say my grace 'cause I'm grateful for the food that I was fed
So thankful for the prayers that you sent
Dear God, she never had a son where he would be the best son if she ever had one
And if she was still here today, I would say, I would say

I owe it all you
When I need someone I can depend on
I owe it all you
When I need a little help looking my lights on
I owe it all you
When I need someone to call
Owe it all you

You was the one that everyone could trust
You were the only one who would always keep in touch
I remember all the times you sent a letter just because
All the times you would take to show a little extra love
Dear God, she never had a son where he would be the best son if she ever had one
And if she was still here today, I would say, I would say

I owe it all you
When I need someone I can depend on
I owe it all you
When I need a little help looking my lights on
I owe it all you
When I need someone to call
Owe it all you

How can I thank you for opening your heart
You were gone but you had a brand new start
Now I sing a song to the world in your honor
No time, now you're gone, wish you still here mama
Owe it all you
Owe it all you
Owe it all you
Owe it all you
I Owe it all you
Owe it all you
Owe it all you

Dear God, Dear God
Dear God, oh
I owe it all you ---
