She 5 foot 2
On section 8, the first of 15th is her favorite day
And in nine months she'll have the number 5
She only need one thing to survive
She gives them how is she traps it low
And you know how the story goes

I said the girls, girls, girls
Chasing the boys, boys, boys
Chasing their money
Don't chase the money
I said the girls, girls, girls
Chasing the boys, boys, boys
Chasing their money
And the money don't run

They called my house
When I'm not home
And leave dirty messages on my phone
When I come home they're at my door
Telling me they the one they're looking for
When I'm on stage all the ladies scream
But all I'm thinking of is fairy creeps

I said the girls, girls, girls
Chasing the boys, boys, boys
Chasing their money
Don't chase the money
I said the girls, girls, girls
Chasing the boys, boys, boys
Chasing their money
And the money don't run

I step in the bank
Around the wait, I needed some extraction to get me through the day
The teller told me I was overdrawn
Sorry Ms. Perfect but your money gone
Sorry if you're flat but your money's gone
Now I got to forward and get my payment on

I said the girls, girls, girls
Chasing the boys, boys, boys
Chasing their money
Don't chase the money
I said the girls, girls, girls
Chasing the boys, boys, boys
Chasing their money
And the money don't run
Said the money don't run

I said the girls, girls, girls
Chasing the boys, boys, boys
Chasing their money
Don't chase the money
I said the girls, girls, girls
Chasing the boys, boys, boys
Chasing their money
And the money don't run

Don't chase the money
You can't chase the money
No, don't chase the money
Don't go chasing the money
Cause the money don't run
Don't chase the money
Cause the money don't run
And the money don't run---
