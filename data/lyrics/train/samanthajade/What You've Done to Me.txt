Sometimes you get what you want
Sometimes you get what you don't
Sometimes ya, get nothing at all

And when it finally comes round
You tear it up, break it down down
'Til there's nothing at all

I used to be so in control
No one could ever touch me
I'd tell myself I'd never fall
And nobody would catch me

You shot your love through my defenses
And left me wide open
Feels like my feet can't touch the ground (the ground)
That's what you've done to me

I'm a rocket to the sun
I'm a heartbeat on the run
That's what you've, what you've done to me
I'm a bullet I can fly
When you kiss me I could die
That's what you've, what you've done to me (Done to me, to me...)

Sometimes you love but they don't
Sometimes they love but you won't
Sometimes ya, just can't figure it out

My planets aligned
And there's no doubt in my mind
Mmm..

Baby, you shot your love through my defenses
And left me wide open
Feels like my feet can't touch the ground
That's what you've done to me

I'm a rocket to the sun
I'm a heartbeat on the run
That's what you've, what you've done to me
I'm a bullet I can fly
When you kiss me I could die
That's what you've, what you've done to me (Done to me)
(Ooh hoo ooh hoo) Done to me
(Ooh hoo ooh hoo) Done to me
I'm a rocket to the sun
I'm a heartbeat on the run
That's what you've, what you've done to me (Done to me)

I used to be so in control
No one could ever touch me
I'd tell myself I'd never fall
And nobody would catch me

I'm a rocket to the sun
I'm a heartbeat on the run
That's what you've, what you've done to me (You've done to me)
I'm a bullet I can fly
When you kiss me I could die
That's what you've, what you've done to me (You've done to me)

I'm a rocket to the sun
I'm a heartbeat on the run
That's what you've, what you've done to me (Done to me)
I'm a bullet I can fly
When you kiss me I could die
That's what you've, what you've done to me (Done to me)

And nobody would catch me
(Ooh hoo ooh hoo ooh hoo)
(Ooh hoo ooh hoo ooh hoo)
And nobody would catch me
(Ooh hoo ooh hoo ooh hoo)
(Ooh hoo ooh hoo ooh hoo)

I'm a rocket to the sun
I'm a heartbeat on the run
That's what you've, what you've done to me (Done to me)
I'm a bullet I can fly (Done to me)
When you kiss me I could die
That's what you've, what you've (done to me) ---
