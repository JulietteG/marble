Bang, bang !

Could a body close the mind out
Stitch a seam across the eye 
If you can be good, youll live forever 
If youre bad, youll die when you die 

Hearing only one true note 
On the one and only sound 
Unzip my body 
Take my heart out 
'Cause I need a beat to give this tune

Taking a picture of 
Taking a picture of 
Taking a picture of 

Oh the body swayed to music 
Oh the lightning glance 
If I would give it all and all 
Maybe you would hear me 
Ask for half a chance 

Hearing only one root note 
Planted firmly in the ground 
Undo my heart, unzip my body and 
Lend to my ear a clear and a deafening sound 

Unzip my heart 

And if I need a rhythm 
Itll be to my heart I listen 
If it dont get me too far wrong 

And if I 
And if I 
And if I need a rhythm 
Its gonna be to my heart I listen 
If it dont take me too far gone 

Everybody smile please 
Nobody pay no mind to me 
Finger in position on the switch 
A little flash photography 

Taking a picture of you 
Taking a picture of 
Taking a picture of me 
Taking a picture
