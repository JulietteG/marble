I know a place
where you can go
when you're flying high
or laying low
and I've got the time
I've got pleny to spare
ooh-ooh, ooh yeah
I've got the time and I've got the place
I wish you were there

I've got the will, yeah
to have you around
whether you're up
or whether you're down
and I know the way
to make you shine
ooh-ooh, ooh yeah
I've got the will and I've got the way
I wish you were mine

I've got the time and I've got the place
I wish you were there
