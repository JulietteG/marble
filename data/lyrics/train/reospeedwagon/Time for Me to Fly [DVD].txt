I've been around for you
Been up and down for you
But I just can't get any relief

I've swallowed my pride for you
Lived and lied for you
But you still make me feel like a thief

You got me stealin' your love away cuz you never give it
Peeling the years away and we can't relive it
Oh, I make you laugh
And you make me cry
I believe it's time for me to fly

You said we'd work it out
You said that you had no doubt
That deep down we were really in love
Oh, but I'm tired of holding on to a feeling I know is gone
I do believe that I've had enough

I've had enough of the falseness of a worn out relation
Enough of the jealousy and the intoleration
Oh, I make you laugh
And you make me cry
I believe it's time for me to fly

(Chorus)
(Time for me to fly)
Oh, I've got to set myself free
(Time for me to fly)
That's just how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly

Oh, don't ya know it's time for me to fly
Oh, I've got to set myself free
Oh, baby that's just how it's got to be
Oh, I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly 
It's time for me to fly
It's time for me to fly
(It's time for me to fly)
It's time for me to fly 
(It's time for me to fly)
It's time for me to fly 
(It's time for me to fly)
It's time for me to fly---Lyrics submitted by M Marvell.
