I've been around for you
Been up and Down for you
But I just can't get any relief

I've swallowed my pride for you
I've lived and lied for you                                                                                                    but you still make me feel like a thief

You've got me stealing your love away 'cause you never give it
Peeling the years away,
And we can't relive it.

Well I make you laugh,
And you make me cry

I believe it's time for me to fly...

You said we'd work it out.
You said that you had no doubt.
That deep down we were really in love.

Oh, But I'm tired of holding on
To a feeling I know is gone
I do believe that I've had enough

I've had enough of the Falseness of a worn out relation
Enough of the jealousy and and the intoleration.

Oh I make you laugh, and you make me cry.
I believe it's time for me to fly...

(chorus)
Time for me to Fly.....
Oh I've got to set myself free.
Time for me to fly...
That's just how it's got to be...
I know it hurts to say goodbye..
but It's time for me to fly.....
Fly...

Mmmmm Girl.. Yea..

Oh it's time for me to fly.
Oh I've got to set myself free
Oh baby, that's just how it's got to be...
I know it hurts to say goodbye.
But it's time for me to fly...

It's time for me to fly...
High....

(8x)
It's time for me to fly...---Lyrics submitted by Cora Vandalsen.
