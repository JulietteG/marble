In your letter, you said you didn't love me.
You said you wanna leave me,
But you could've said it better.

Oh, in your letter, you said yu couldn't face me.
You said you could replace me,
But you could've said it better.

You could have left him only, for an evening let him be lonely.
But you hid behind your poison pen and his pride
You could have told him somethin' and proved to
me you don't love him.
But you hid behind your future, full of lies.

Oh, In Your Letter---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
