Ease yourself on down
And if you're bound and frowned
You better put it on down
'Cause 4am, gonna hit it again
Leaving dollar bills on the buffalo hills
The moon's eye is frozen shut
These vacant lanes unknown, uncut
Shredded up and sold for seed
Another tribute sent to a backwards breed
Hear those buzzards flap their heaps
Up above where skies are cheap
For pioneers with chandeliers
Darkened arks in diamond ears
Through those rusty windows
Traffics shoot like venom
Static addicts
Causing us to fly like sticks
Fumes of flags and endless wicks

INFERNO!!!

Habit-trails of garbage pails
I search and strip my stale grails
And when it's time to strike the blues
I gotta let my jive and jackass fuse
This pollution is electrocution
Riffs and rags, no resolution
My wagon limps a miser's pace
On borrowed fuels of lice and lace
Hail to the mother man
Can't stand the soul can
Cold sweat, tiger tan
Sold my gold and left this land
Vaccination, cancellation
Tuning in to the two-bit station
Alkaline batteries shot
Summer's all tied
In the hangman's know

INFERNO!!!---
