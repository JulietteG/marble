Hey, hey
Da, da, da, da

I feel uptight
When I walk in the city
I feel so cold
When I'm at home
Feels like everything's
Starting to hit me
I lost bed
Ten minutes ago

Modern guilt
I'm staring at nothing
Modern guilt
I'm under lock and key
It's not
What I have changed
Turning into convention
Don't know
What I've done
But I feel ashamed
Standing outside
The glass room sidewalk
These people talk about
Impossible things
And I'm falling down
The conversations
Another palm beats
Into you

Modern guilt
Is all in our hands
Modern guilt
Won't get me to bed
Say what you will
Smoking my cigarette
Don't know
What I've done
But I feel afraid---
