Lay your arms down
Say your prayer
Live the day before you turn it
Live the day before you turn it
Live the day before you turn it
On and off

Live the day before you turn it
All around

Oh, Karen! (Turn it all around, whoa-oh-oh)
Oh, Karen! (Turn it all around, whoa-oh-oh)

Why are you so confident?
Why are you so confident?
Why are you so confident?

Turn it all around
Turn it all around---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
