Oh country down
Where I found my proving ground
All along the floodline
Wheels are turning around
The hills roll out like centuries
Pass by without a sound
Just a mile outside of town

Downriverbound
Where the [?] sky fell down
A plot against your will
Is furrowed into your brow
Against your better judgment
It's all behind you now
Just a mile outside of town

What's the use of being found?
You can lose yourself [?] underground
In the weeds hiding down river right next door
There's no frame around your picture
Just a view through my back door

Time evermore
You just found what you're looking for
A tiger rose growing through your prison door
Reaching for sunlight, can't see it anymore
Just a mile from my back door

You could wake up on a lifeboat 'neath the sun
On a ladder up to the sky
You're standing on the lowest rung
Holding a lifeline, using my best defense
Running in the undertow I couldn't fight against

Oh lay me down
Where we found my proving ground
All along the floodline
Waves are turning around
The hills roll out like centuries
Pass by without a sound
Just a mile outside of town ---
