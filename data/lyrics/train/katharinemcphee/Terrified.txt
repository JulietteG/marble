You by the light
Is the greatest find
In a world full of wrong you're the thing that's right
Finally made it through the lonely to the other side

You set it again, my heart's in motion
Every word feels like a shooting star
I'm at the edge of my emotions
Watching the shadows burning in the dark,
And I'm in love and I'm terrified.
For the first time and the last time
In my only life.

And this could be good
It's already better than that
And nothing's worst than knowing
You're holding back
I could be all that you needed
If you let me try

You set it again, my hearts in motion
Every word feels like a shooting star
I'm at the edge of my emotions
Watching the shadows burning in the dark
And I'm in love and I'm terrified
For the first time and the last time
in my only

I only said it cause i mean it
I only mean it cause it's true
So don't you doubt what i've been dreaming
Cause it fills me up and holds me close
Whenever i'm without you

You set it again, my hearts in motion
Every word feels like a shooting star
Watching the shadows burning in the dark
And I'm in love and I'm terrified
For the first time and the last time
In my only life---Lyrics submitted by Cathy.
