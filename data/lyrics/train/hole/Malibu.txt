Crash and burn, all the stars explode tonight
How'd you get so desperate, how'd you stay alive
Help me please, burn the sorrow from your eyes
Oh come on be alive again, Don't lay down and die

Hey, hey
You know what to do
Oh baby fly away to Malibu

Get well soon, please don't go any higher
How are you so burned, when you're barely on fire
Cry to angels, I'm gonna rescue you I'm gonna set you free tonight, baby, pour over me

Hey, hey
Were all watchin' you
Oh baby fly away to Malibu
Cry to the angels that swallow you
Go and part the sea, yeah, in Malibu

And the sun goes down, and I watch you slip away
And the sun goes down, and I walk into the waves
And the sun goes down, and I watch slip you away
And I walk...

And I know, love would tear you apart
And I know, the darkest secret of your heart

Hey, hey
I'm gonna follow you
Oh baby fly away to Malibu
Oceans of angels, Oceans of stars
Down by the sea is where you drown your scars, uh-huh

I can't be near you, the light just radiates
I can't be near you, the light just radiates---Lyrics submitted by will.
