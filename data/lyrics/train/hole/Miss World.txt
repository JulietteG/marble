I am the girl you know
Can't look you in the eye
I am the girl you know so sick
I cannot try
I am the one you want
Can't look you in the eye
I am the girl you know
I lie and lie and lie
I'm miss world
Somebody kill me
Kill me pills
No one cares my friends
My friend
I'm miss worlds
Watch me break
And watch me burn
No one is listening
My friends
Now I've made my bed I'll lie in it
I've made my bed I'll die in it
I've made my bed I'll lie in it
I've made my bed I'll die in it
Kill girls watch
When I eat ether
Suck me under
Maybe forever
My friends
I made my bed I'll lie in it
I made my bed I'll die in it
I made my bed I'll die in it
I made my bed I'll cry in it
I made my bed I'll die in it
I made my bed I'll die in it
I made my bed I'll cry in it
My friends
I am the girl you know
Can't look you in the eye---Lyrics submitted by Gaile.
