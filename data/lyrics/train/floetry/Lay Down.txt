Hey baby
I feel good today you know?
(Lay down)
Lets just...lets just lay down
(Lay down)
Spend some time you know?
Laugh, joke
(Lay down)
Just be silly
(Lets just lay down)

[Verse 1: Marsha]
How are you?
Well I'm just fine
I missed your call, around five
I'm getting back to you, cause you are on my mind
I wanna know, can I see you tonight?
If you cant, I'll understand
Ain't gonna front, I wanna take ya hand
And show ya baby, that I'm sincere
I want you to be here

[Chorus]
Let's just spend a little time,
Do a little more
Share what's in our hearts
Give each other all
Nothing more to do,
Lying right here with you
Let's just lay down

[Natalie]
I'm so happy that we're here together
(Lets just lay down)
(Lay down)
This kind of reminds me of forever
(Lets just lay down)

[Verse 2: Marsha]
How am I?
I cant complain
I'm really happy
That you're here with me
Again, it's been awhile
I'll tell you what,
If you have got a minute,
We can lay until the sun, comes up
I'll understand
If its much to early to determine
If we can, stay together
This way together
Let's lay together

[Chorus]

[Natalie]
Lets just...let's stay in today
(Lets just lay down)
(Lay down)
I wanna just love you in that special way you know?
(Lets just lay down)
(Lay down)

[Bridge: Natalie]
This is all we need
A little time to just,
Chill back and be...
Together
So much going on outside of these walls
But...I just wanted to share with you,
The truth
All I do is think about you...
My love
Maybe we could, stay home today
I just wanna...share
I just wanna...care
We should take the time (Time to be in love)
We just have to...choose (Choose)
What we wanna...do (Do)
I miss you (Yeah)
Can I kiss you? (Yeah)
Let's spend some time
(Spend a little more time)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Natalie]
Yeah, can we just focus on us?
(Lets just lay down)
(Lay down)
Right home to your heart, it's never too much
(Lets just lay down)
(Lay down)
Wherever you want,
The bathroom, the living room,
We can
(Lay lay lay down)
(Lay down)
The kitchen, the bedroom
We can just
(Lay lay lay down)
(Lay down)
Lay down baby
Please just
Let me
Let you
Lay down---Lyrics submitted by Polly.
