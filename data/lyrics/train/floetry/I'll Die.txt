We are who we choose to be.
I'm responsible for me.

If I stay right here,
I'll die inside.
Ran out of tears,
I can barely get by.
It's fair to say,
That we tried.
You know I wanna stay,
If I do, I'll die.

Coulda been another one of those,
Coulda made it,
Woulda made it,
Shoulda made it,
Had I gave it,
Just a little bit more of my time.
Just a little focus,
Coulda broke this,
Woulda woke this,
Shoulda choked this,
Had I chose bliss I'dve left this infatuation,
Far behind,
I'll exchange my mind,
No more wasting time,
This process is mine,
In Your eyes,
My reflection is blind,
In your arms I decide,
This is our last night,
Goodbye.
(Goodbye)
I have to leave you.
(Goodbye)
I have to be true.
(So long for you and I.)

If I stay right here,
I'll die inside.
Ran out of tears,
I can barely get by.
It's fair to say,
That we tried.
You know I wanna stay,
If I do, I'll die.

Been a addicted,
To the burden of the gifted,
To the sermon of the shifted,
Always praying to be lifted.
Always settling,
Never bettering.
How'm I gonna win,
If I'm not listening.
Always asking for
Never noticing,
Every move I make,
This game's reacting in,
Perfect symmetry,
I'm my destiny,
Must invest in me,
Or I'm just gonna be,
Victim of circumstance,
All is left to chance,
How can I enhance?
I'm afraid to dance.
I must break this trance,
'Cause it's deafening,
So I'm breathing in.
I'm breathing in.
Breath to get control of me.
I have to breath.
I have to be.

If I stay right here,
I'll die inside.
Ran out of tears,
I can barely get by.
It's fair to say,
That we tried.
You know I wanna stay,
If I do, I'll die.

What's the use of living here,
If I don't feel alive?
Denied mistakes,
So much I've done.
So much to cry.
I cry

If I stay right here,
I'll die inside.
Ran out of tears,
I can barely get by.
It's fair to say,
That we tried.
You know I wanna stay,
If I do, I'll die.---Lyrics submitted by chanel rodney.
