Pretender
I know a man
He's a great pretender
A great pretender
He's seen a million faces
A million faces
Now there's silence
In his heart
He span away
On a rollercoaster
A rollercoaster
While trying to grasp
All the love that was given
The love that was given
In return for
What he burns for

He's walking a thin line
A free fall on both sides
Still he strives to give
What he gives to me
Without ever letting greed
Into his heart
There's only space
For a man who's dreaming
A man who's dreaming
If the river is full
Of souls who share them
Souls who share them
That's what he lives for
What he dies for

He's walking a thin line
A free fall on both sides
Still he strives to give
What he gives to me
Without ever letting greed
Into his heart
He blocked off his senses
Did not let anyone in
They got past his defences
Run, run, run, run
Run!

He's walking a thin line
A free fall on both sides
Still he strives to give
What he gives to me
Without ever letting greed
Into his heart---Lyrics submitted by Sepehr.
