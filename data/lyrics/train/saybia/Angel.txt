Angel
It's not the world that's out of order 
It's me, it's me 
Guess I ran along my borders 
Just to see, just to see 

If a friendly face would drop by and rescue me 
But I lost my faith as I lost my way 

It's not the street that's made of concrete 
It's you, it's you 
Guess I try to penetrate it with this point of view 
I had never taken more than I give to you 
I was led astray and I lost my way 

Never felt so alone 
Stripped naked and cold to the bone 
Lost my faith in her on my own 
With no queue by the door to my home 

It's not the light that casts the shadow 
It's doubt, it's doubt 
As a melancholic sorrow came about, came about 

I had never fought as hard though as I do for you 
I'm not getting strong to prove I'm wrong 

Never felt so alone 
Stripped naked and cold to the bone 
Lost my faith in her on my own 
With no queue by the door to my home 

And god sent an angel 
An angel 
She's an angel 
An angel... 

Never felt so alone 
Stripped naked and cold to the bone 
Lost my faith in her on my own 
With no queue by the door to my home 
God sent an angel 
Sent an angel 
She's an angel 
An angel 
She's an aaaa... an angel 

It's not my life that's obsolete 
It's youth, my youth 
Guess it took a while for me to see the truth, see the truth 
I got stuck in minor details so I missed the point 
I got so much more than I bargained for...---Lyrics submitted by Mar.
