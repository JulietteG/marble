I surrender

A million suns are glowing in the night
Everything is quiet
Except for all the voices in my head
That say your name
Tonight I'm letting go
About to give in

I surrender myself
Into the arms of a beautiful stranger
I surrender myself to you - to you
I surrender myself
Into the arms of a beautiful stranger
I surrender myself to you - to you

There's only one bridge left for me
My heart is almost free
Beautiful by my side
But all I think about is you
And tonight I'm letting go
About to give in

I surrender myself
Into the arms of a beautiful stranger
I surrender myself to you - to you
I surrender myself
Into the arms of a beautiful stranger
I surrender myself to you - to you

Who really loves me
You really love me
My beautiful stranger
You really love me like I love you---Lyrics submitted by Mar.
