Maybe I'll treat you better. Maybe I'll be your friend. Maybe I'll wear your sweater. Maybe I'll find some time to go shopping and buy you nicer clothes. 
Cause once I've got I gotta go. I'll cook you dinner put some meat in those bones. 
That's the least I could do. I'd be so good for you, 
I'd build you up, I'll be the best, you'd have it all. If we were. If we were. 
You'd never be so down depressed, If we were. If we were. 
I'd build you up, you'll never rest. If we were. If we were. We'd be the most beautiful mess. If we were, forever.
Maybe I'll do your laundry. Maybe I'll scratch your back. Tell you I adore you. Make you feel like a man, and all of that. Now wouldn't that be nice? And you gotta love what the things you like. I'll drive you crazy for the rest of your life. That's the least I could do. I'd be so good to you. 
I'd build you up, I'll be the best you'd have it all. If we were, If we were. 
You'd never be so down depressed. If we were, If we were. 
I'd build you up you'll never rest. If we were, if we were. 
We'd be the most beautiful mess. If we were, forever. 
You don't realize what you're missing. All the hugging, all the kissing. Shut up and listen to me!

       But we're not. I forgot.---Lyrics submitted by Klaudia.
