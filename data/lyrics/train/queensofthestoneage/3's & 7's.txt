Lie, lie to my face
Tell me it ain't no thing
That's what I wanna hear.
Take, a lie to the grave
That's what an old friend told me
Look what it did for him.

The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss,
Then I'm in heaven now.

Run, you'll never escape
You see you go nowhere so new you appear
Broke, laid to waste
Turn into sweet nothings
That kiss you goodbye.

The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss,
Then I'm in heaven now.

I keep doin' it over and over again
The never ending places I've never been
No one is catching on or calling my bluff
The devil made me, only we never met
What you do is say it with a smile boy
Makin' us all forget
What you do is say it with a smile boy
Makin' us all forget
Makin' us all forget
Makin' us all forget
