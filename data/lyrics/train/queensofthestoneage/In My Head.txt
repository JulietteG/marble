t's the cruelest joke to play
I'm so high, i run in place
Only a line, we separate, so

I keep on playin our favorite song
I turn it up while you're gone
It's all i got when you're in my head and you're in my head so i need it

You're the only thing i've got that i can't seem to get enough
We collide for one embrace, so

Hurry up & wait forever
Hurry up & wait for forever---Lyrics submitted by julian.
