Thank You for the way
That You love us, how You love us
Thank You for the way
You have made us

We were created
For Your pleasure, for Your presence
For the glory of Your name
Thank You for the way that You love us

Jesus, faithful King
Lord, with grateful hearts we sing
How great is the love
How great is the love of our Savior

The weight of the cross, the curse of our shame
You carried it all and rose from the grave
How great is the love
How great is the love of our Savior, of our Savior

Thank You for the grace
That has saved us, You forgave us
Thank You for the way
You have freed us

We have been ransomed
We've been rescued, we've been purchased
With the price of Your own life
Thank You for the way that You love us

Jesus, faithful King
Lord, with grateful hearts we sing
How great is the love
How great is the love of our Savior

The weight of the cross, the curse of our shame
You carried it all and rose from the grave
How great is the love
How great is the love of our Savior, of our Savior

Thank You for the way
That You love us, how You love us
Thank You for the way
That You love us, how You love us

Thank You for the way
That You love us, how You love us
Thank You for the way
That You love us

Jesus, faithful King
Lord, with grateful hearts we sing
How great is the love
How great is the love of our Savior

The weight of the cross, the curse of our shame
You carried it all and rose from the grave
How great is the love
How great is the love of our Savior, of our Savior

How great, how great is Your love
Jesus, how You love us
Your great love, Your great love ---Lyrics submitted by regina miranda.
