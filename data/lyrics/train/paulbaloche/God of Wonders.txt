Lord of all creation,
Of water, earth, and sky,
The heavens are Your tabernacle,
Glory to the Lord on High

(Chorus)
God of Wonders, beyond our galaxy,
You are holy, holy,
The universe declares Your majesty,
You are holy, holy,
Lord of Heaven and earth,
Lord of Heaven and earth

Early in the morning,
I will celebrate the light,
And when I stumble in the darkness,
I will call Your name by night

(Repeat chorus)

Hallelujah, to the Lord of Heaven and Earth (Repeat 3X)

God of Wonders, beyond our galaxy,
You are holy, holy,
The universe declares Your majesty,
You are holy, holy

(Repeat chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Hailey.
