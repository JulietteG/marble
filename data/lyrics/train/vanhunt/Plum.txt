She talks to me while youre not lookin
She says Hello, I say Hi cutty
And youve turned to leave, youre feelin moody,
But she shakes when she waves back to me
I beg you to come back by Tuesday
You say Ok, if you buy me a ruby
And as you stare at your new Jewelry
I stand behind you and I say Hi booty

Lord whyd you give that girl a . bum
And make it the shape of a plum
Dont tell me how to hold my nuclear bomb
Till youve resisted the urge to love one

What have you done to her
She was once a lady now she is an unreachable
I take her for a walk down Gettysburg
Once searchin here for love
Now shes a rebel

Lord whyd you put that girl in aquarium
Now shes easy to see, hard to touch
I can only look through my camera
Like a tourist Im s

I reach for you everyday
Walk with you as you sway to the shower
Im addicted to you 
Youre too pretty to abuse youre pretty powers

Lord whyd you give that girl a  bum
And make it the shape of a plum
Dont tell me how to hold my nuclear bomb
Till youve resisted the urge to love one

Lord whyd you put that girl in aquarium
Now shes easy to see, hard to touch
I can only look through my camera
Like a tourist Im  s

The fortunate ....man steadied its scope
Just as she emerged from the hot shower
He thought of a red lollypop.
The sun had to squeeze around her
Her silouette was croped
Her body whether in cloth or naked.
Looks like a sculpture ready for war
Does this point to some instability
.... worst to get character to every part of her.---Lyrics submitted by Nicolas.
