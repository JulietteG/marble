I ain't got no woman but I don't feel sad
I ain't got no woman, but I don't, no I don't feel sad
'Cause the woman that was with me
She treated me so dirty, lowdown, and bad

Well, I cried when she left me
Cried all night, alone in my bed
You know, I cried when she left me
Cried all night, alone in my bed

Yeah, but then one day it hit me
I should be happy instead

Well, now, why should I be sorry
That the girl had to leave
All she did was hurt me
Keep me beggin' on my knees

And a whole lot of my money
Ended up in her hands
And she turned around and told me
I was just a broken down old man

See, I ain't got no woman but I don't feel sad nor bad
'Cause the woman that was with me
She treated me so dirty, lowdown, and bad
Yes, she's bad

Now, the next woman that I gets me
I'm gonna treat her the best way that I can
You know, the next woman that I gets me
I'm gonna treat her the best way that I can

But in turn she's gonna have to treat me
Like the real, real, real man I really am
Ohh, yeah, yes, she do---
