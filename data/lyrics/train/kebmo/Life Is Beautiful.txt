Let's go drifting, through the trees
Let's go sailing, on the sea
Let's go dancing, on the juke joint floor
And leave our troubles all behind, and have a party

So easily forgotten, are the most important things
Like the melody and the moonlight in your eyes
And the song that lasts forever, keeps on gettin betta
All the time

Cuz life is beautiful
Life is wonderous
Every star above is shining just for us
Life is beautiful, on a stormy night
Somewhere in the world the sun is shining bright

I get crazy, so afraid
That I might lose you, one fine day
And I'll be nothing but a tired old man 
And I don't wanna be without you, at the party

So easily forgotten, are the most important things
Is that I love you, I do
And I want to spend my days and nights
Walking through this crazy world with you

Cuz life is beautiful
Life is wonderous
Every star above is shining just for us
Life is beautiful, on a stormy night
Somewhere in the world the sun is shining bright

So easily forgotten, are the most important things
Is that I love you, I do
And I want to spend my days and nights
Walking through this crazy world with you, that's right baby

Cuz life is beautiful
Life is wonderous
Every star above is shining just for us
Life is beautiful, on a stormy night
Somewhere in the world the sun is shining bright---
