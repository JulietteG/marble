Early in the morning
I was in my bed
My baby turned and kissed me
On the top of my head
Made me breakfast
Sent me on my way
Kissed me on the lips
And said Have a nice day

She had me right where she wanted
Yea I was in a trance
She said aint nothing wrong with Texas
But Id really love to go to France

I would do most anything
But Im still making payments
On her wedding ring
I went to my employer
Mr. Hayes
Ive been working like a mother
How bout a doggone raise

He said money's tight
You know there aint no chance
I said wont you reconsider
My baby wants to go to France

I see us walking
Along the Champs Elysees
Exchanging kisses
In a small French caf

Wake up momma
Dont you fret
I found two cheap tickets
On the internet
We leave on Monday
For two whole weeks
All we have to do is just
Eat and sleep

I had her right where I wanted
Yea she was in a trance
I said aint nothing wrong with Texas
But you and I are going to France

Baby, ain't nothing wrong with Texas
But you and I are going to France---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
