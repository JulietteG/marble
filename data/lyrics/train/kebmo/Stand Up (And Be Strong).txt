Listen up, get ready, I'm not gonna take no more
There's a revolution, revelation, going on in my soul
Buckle up, get ready, we're not gonna sit back and wait
And allow ourselves and each other to loose control about things
There'll be no sacrifice
No more tears
No more pain
Lord, no more fears
I got to make my move
Get out of my way
'Cause we've been waiting way too long

We don't wait
Wait no more
We got a mind
Of our own
That's right
We can't go wrong
If we stand up and be strong

Get up, everybody, get off your ass
We got to do something and we got to do it fast
'Cause the people are hungry, starving, and a few things more
don't wait for Jesus, he ain't coming back no more
We've got to sacrifice
write no bill
Shed no blood, no
Shed no tears
Gonna make our move, get out of my way
We've been waiting way too long

We don't wait
Wait no more
We got a mind
Of our own
That's right
We can't go wrong
If we stand up and be strong---Lyrics submitted by Cathleen Lehn.
