BABY I CANT WAIT TO GET U UP IN MY ROOM
BABY FIRST  LET ME GO AND SET UP THE MOOD 
NOW IM GONNA DO U UP AND THEN IM GONNA DO U DOWN 
IM GONNA HAVE THAT BODY BABY FLOAT IT ALL AROUND 
AND ALL U GOTTA DO IS GET CLOSE TO ME 
BRING IT ALL TO ME ITS GOING DOWNNNNN 

(WE AINT HAVING SEX 
WERE MAKING  MOMENTS THAT WILL OUT LAST THE WORLD 
AND THIS AINT SEX THIS IS A SIMBLE OF THE TURE MAKINGS OF LOVE

BABY I CANT WAIT TO REMEMBER YOU 
GIVE U UR 1ST FONE CALL ON UR BIRTHDAY 
HOW I DID U UP AND THEN HOW I DID U DOWN 
YEAH I HAD THAT PRETTY BODY FLOATING ALL AROUND 
THINKING BACK TO WHEN U WERE CLOSE TO ME 
AND I THOUGHT WE WOULD NEVER COME DOWN
