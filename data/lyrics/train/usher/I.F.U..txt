Yeah
I'm freakin' you
And this the double T
I'm freaky you

I bet you feelin' the stare
The moment is real
But I know you in serious thinking you
I know you prepare
You won't make up the stairs
And you came over here
Let me turn the lights up

I just want you under five it
You should let me pay the trade you everything
You got me being unexcited
Baby step into my room I might grow
Don't need a wedding ring

I think sex was made to strangers
Making love this far the one to plan to stay together
How 'bout we can braise the danger
[?] when it's all said and done
We gonna do whole lot of...
We gonna do a whole lot of...
Yeah!

[Chorus:]
I ain't gotta be your man
You ain't gotta be my girl
Let's let go off everything they talked you in this world
We gonna do a whole lot of... yeah!

I'm freakin' you, yeah
I'm freakin' you

I'm not into fantasizing
I much rather put my hands on everything
I just hope that I'm invited yeah
Up into your room I'm your groom
I ain't got a ring

I think sex was made to strangers
Making love this far the one to plan to stay together
How 'bout we can braise the danger
[?] when it's all said and done
We gonna do whole lot of...
We gonna do a whole lot of...
Yeah!

[Chorus:]
I ain't gotta be your man
You ain't gotta be my girl
Let's let go off everything they talked you in this world
We gonna do a whole lot of... yeah!

Can't deny what's here between us
Right now
I can feel your heart beating
[?] so dangerous
We gonna do a whole lot of
You gotta take ti for me
We gonna do a whole lot of...
Yeah

[Chorus:]
I ain't gotta be your man
You ain't gotta be my girl
Let's let go off everything they talked you in this world
We gonna do a whole lot of... yeah!

Expectations on the first name bases
Is get together on exchange faces---
