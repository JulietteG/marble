Big ballin' is my hobby
So much so they think I'm down with the Illuminati
My watch do illuminate
My pockets are naughty
But I'm God body
Ya'll better ask somebody
I was born a God
I made myself a king
Which means I downgraded to a human being
You was born a goddess
I made you my queen
Which means we upgraded to Louis the thirteen
(Hot tottie)Hot tottie Her poppy like cognac
Her momma like herb tea
We burned a couple of sacks
And after tea steeped I creeped all in her teepee
We did it Indian style
Had the girls speaking
In tongue she like young you hung
What you done, done
Stop it 'fore you wake up my mom she might (ahhhh)
And now that you've arrived
It's time that I go...

I'm so cold, I'm so cold...

-CHORUS-

I'm so cold, I'm so cold (ho) (x4)

And I need a hot tottie
Will you be my hot tottie?
She say she wanna make me better
She wanna make me better---Lyrics submitted by Manny.
