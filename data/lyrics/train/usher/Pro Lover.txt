Intro: 
Whoa Man, Yall somethin else Lotta Women
You know they say yall do it better than us

Over here lookin how we lookin. Aint that right?
Yeah, go get em girls I see you.

I profess Im a lover, minor scholar of anatomy, a Doc of feminine chemistry
Got a healthy fascination for a multitude of relation with plenty women thats in the field
And it happens that every once in a while I go too deep that I gotta shut it down
She keep on comin by wont quit callin
Its safe to say that she fallin she pleadin 
She dont want me to leave I had to tell her

(No, No, No) She keep on beggin for more
(No, No, No) She said you dont love me no more
Thats when I be like
Lovin me baby thats a no-no
Im better when Im touch and go
Im tryin to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player Im a pro (lover  x2)

As a quid pro quo we can both come and go This aint about fidelity (uh uh)
Thought I was a pimp, player, hustler, baller (heh)
Whoa man she a G and do it better than me
And it happens that every once in a while
She gon cook just to hook me for a while
Cant escape, take your pick, either way youre a trick cuz
Man, if she layin for it, that means you payin for it

(No, No, No) She keep on beggin for more
(No, No, No) She said you dont love me no more
Thats when I be like
Lovin me baby thats a no-no
Im better when Im touch and go
Im tryin to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player Im a pro (lover  x2)

Tick-Tock better hurry times runnin out
So you better be sure before we lay down
Knock-Knock daddys home open up girl
I can tell thats its been a while (You been waitin)
Been through it so many times (With women that I deal with)
Aint tryin to make you mine (But I like the feelin)
Lets both be honest here babe, we dont want drama here babe
Cuz when you give it up, you gon get addicted and go crazy and lose your mind

(Oh no baby, dont be so mean. Dont mean to do you like that. Keep on askin me for more)

Lovin me baby thats a no-no
Im better when Im touch and go
Im tryin to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player Im a pro (lover  x2)
Not just a player Im a pro 
Not just a player Im a pro (lover  x2)
