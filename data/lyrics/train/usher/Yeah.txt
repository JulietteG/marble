Peace up, A-Town down

I was up in the club with my homies, tryin' to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key
You should know how it feels
I seen shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear
You would think that she knew me
I decided to chill, conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow
She's sayin', come get me
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, baby let's go
When I told her, I said

Yeah, shorty got down low said, come and get me
Yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah, her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
Yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up one me screamin', yeah

She's all up in my head now
Got me thinkin' that it might
Be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave
And I got to keep it real now
Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that's just ain't me
Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way's she Get Low
I'm like, yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave
And I say

Yeah, shorty got down low said, come and get me
Yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah, her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
Yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up one me screamin', yeah

Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And roar, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'mma milk the cow
And forget about game, I'mma spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in their birthday suit
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin', then I put em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double D's
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say

Yeah, shorty got down low said, come and get me
Yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah, her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
Yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up one me screamin', yeah

Take that and rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go clap
Take that, rewind it back
Ursher got the voice make your booty go clap
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go clap
Take that, rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go clap---
