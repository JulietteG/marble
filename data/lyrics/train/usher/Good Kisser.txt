Make every minute worth it, baby
This for Usher, baby
Watch this

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So Im guessin that its true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Dont nobody kiss it like you
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you

Its 5 in the mornin
Kush is rollin while shes makin steak and eggs
At 5 in the mornin
We can only be about to do one thing (what?)

See, I told her
The devil is a lie
Them other girls cant compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open wide
You make me wanna tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

I think that shes a winner
She could be a keeper

Cause shes such a good kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
Oh baby
Shes such a good kisser
Ima rain on this parade
Oh baby

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So Im guessin that its true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Dont nobody kiss it like you
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you

This girl, shes my hero
Get dinero, euros, pesos, francs and yen
(I aint wanna check off either)
Im starin at your barrel
Pull the trigger, chitty, chitty, bang, babe

See, I told her
The devil is a lie
Them other girls cant compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open wide
You make me wanna tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

I think I got a winner
Could be a keeper

Cause shes such a good kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
Oh baby
Shes such a good kisser
Ima rain on this parade
Oh baby

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So Im guessin that its true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Dont nobody kiss it like you
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you

Listen, the only thing I know
You give it to me, baby, with good flow
Dont ever run it back, come on, keep goin
Just give it to me, give it up to me, give it up to me
I cant keep my control
Every time that I see you hit that floor
Just keep on givin it to me, I want mine
Just come on baby, just give it to me, give it up to me

Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissin all night
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissin all night
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissin all night
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissin all night

Cause shes such a good kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
Oh baby
Shes such a good kisser
Ima rain on this parade
Oh baby

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So Im guessin that its true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Dont nobody kiss it like you
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So Im guessin that its true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Dont nobody kiss it like you
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby
Dont nobody kiss it like you, dont nobody kiss it like you---
