Told me there was no rules
When you came out of the blue
Guarded myself from mornings
Crushes dont come with warning

Never have you looked so cute
As when suggesting me
To start something new

Labelled in your head
As a simple flame
But simple makes you melt
Every time you hear me sing

Your favourite star
And now Im your favourite star
You made me your favourite star

(If you got to know me)
(If you took the time)
(I wouldnt have to tie you in)

You got to know me
And you took the time

(But you keep on chasing)
(What you never find)
(Cos Im still on your mind)

Cos Im still on your mind

So you decide its fool [?]
Never gave any clue
We will part and never speak
But my voice is in your ever-dream

If it was up to you
Ill be feinting as a deja vu [?]

A shame you couldnt keep up
To your place
Now I have to leave
Memories in your head

Your favourite star
And now Im your favourite star
You made me your favourite star

(If you got to know me)
(If you took the time)
(I wouldnt have to tie you in)

You got to know me
And you took the time

(But you keep on chasing)
(What you never find)
(Cos Im still on your mind)

Cos Im still on your mind

And maybe if
If you got to know me
Would you change your mind

Maybe if you got to know me
If you took the time
Just maybe if you took the time---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
