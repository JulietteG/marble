I've been trying
To get you under my pressure
I've been trying
To get you under my pressure

I've been trying to hurt you
For as long as I can remember
Looking for the spineless point
And change your summer into winter
When I look into your deepest
I see myself at my weakest
I am walking deep waters
To burn your splendid and virtuous bridges

But you said
Show, show, show
But I won't
Grow, grow, grow 

But you said
Show, show, show
But I won't
Grow, grow, grow

I've been trying
To get you under my pressure
I've been trying
To get you under my pressure

You accepted my crimes
As if you knew they were coming
Like nicking candy from a kid
You been defeating my verbal beatings
No I won't stop my torture
Until you show you got tears too
I'd rather you deal with your temper
Than feel your careless empathy

But you said
Show, show, show
But I won't
Grow, grow, grow

No you said 
Show, Show, Show
I won't
Grow, Grow, grow

I've been trying,
To get you under my pressure
I've been trying,
To get you under my pressure.---Lyrics submitted by Kolton Lane Landreth.
