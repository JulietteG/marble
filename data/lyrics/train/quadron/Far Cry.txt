Structure of my bones condemned me 
by the ghost of your face
dressed in the laws of parental instinct
you drinking the meant that was meant for you
your whole issue this innocence coming of age
sacrifice childhood for growing pain
open the gates of innocence
not depraved nor am I chastity

You already know my name
left undone by mist of fame
lessons are a permanent stain
is my loss worth your gain
walked out before you came
cast a shadow of a shame
next time you might do the same
he's in my every vein

Only way of getting wrong attention
is this fatal attraction
too believe in the goods of decree
one must defend freedom from kings
you wouldn't do what you do if you knew
defy the laws of nature so treacherously
these concealing marks cant be undone
you don't get a second chance I was the only one

You already know my name
left undone by mist of fame
lessons are a permanent stain
is my loss worth your gain
walked out before you came
cast a shadow of a shame
next time you might do the same
he's in my every vein
