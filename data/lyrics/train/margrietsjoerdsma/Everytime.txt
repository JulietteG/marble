Everytime you go away
I miss you
No matter where you go

Everytime you go away
I will miss you
So bad

Cause loving you
After all this years
Is still good

Did i ever feel this way before
I guess so
No longer than a month

Did i ever feel this way before
I guess so 
But no long than a month

Now Im sick and home tied
Theres no escape
Ready or not
you cant hide

Cause loving you
I never thought that would be 
Cause all that i ever loved
Was me

You don t tell me when i m wrong
when i know i am

when im reaching for the sky
you keep me on my feet
we can finally laugh about it
after words
we can help each other out
when one gets hurt

Everytime you go away
I miss you
No matter where you go

Everytime you go away
I will miss you
So bad

Cause loving you
After all this years
Is still good

Did i ever feel this way before
I guess so
But, no longer than a month

Did i ever feel this way before
Did i ever feel this way before
Did i ever feel this way before
Did i ever feel this way before
Did i ever feel this way before
Before
Did i ever feel this way 
Did i ever feel this way 
Did i ever feel this way before
I guess not---Lyrics submitted by just me.
