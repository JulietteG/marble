Don't act surprised it aint like you didn't know
It's been a long long time coming and it's time for me to go
To try and split things up would drive us crazy
So I'm gonna make this easy baby

(Chourus)
You can have the money you can have the house
Take the Cadilac and that boat out back
and your mother's pink and yellow couch
You can have every penny that I'll make from this here song
Girl all I want you to leave me is alone

Don't get me wrong I will always love you girl
You were my life you were my heart you were my world
Cuz we both know it's over there's no need to fight it
And girl I just need some peace and quiet

(Chorus)
You can have the money you can have the house
Take the Cadilac and that boat out back 
and that ugly pink and yellow couch
You can have every penney that I will make from this here song
Girl all I need you to leave me is alone

You can have the money you can have the house
Take the big screen and your diamond ring
and those shoes that you swore you couldn't live without
You can have every penney that I will make from this here song
Girl all I want you to leave me is alone
Girl all I need you to leave me is alone---Lyrics submitted by Barry.
