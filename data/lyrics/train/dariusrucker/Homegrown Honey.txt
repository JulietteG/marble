Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But youre the kinda girl thats got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just aint nothing
They aint never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there aint nothing hotter

Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
Ill take a sip of that smile
Ill bet the boys at home cant leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
Youre so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby youre just so homegrown
Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying Son its on
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song

Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
Ill take a sip of that smile
Ill bet the boys at home cant leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
Youre so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby youre just so homegrown
Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying Son its on
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song

Ooh baby, baby, baby
Youre driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Im a long way away from where Im from
But baby you feel like home

Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
Ill take a sip of that smile
Ill bet the boys at home cant leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
Youre so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby youre just so homegrown
Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying Son its on
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song

Youre so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby youre just so homegrown---
