I heard every word you said
I'm trying hard to understand
Exactly what it is you need from me

Baby I apologize
I never meant to make you cry
But there ain't no doubt
We can work it out, yeah
Cause I'm gonna be around

Don't worry baby
I ain't no maybe
Rain or shine, this love of mine is for you
Let my arms remind you
I'll always be beside you
Holding on until this ride is through
So away we go, down that forever road

Baby as our lives unfold
There's no telling where we'll go
But as far as I can see
It'll be you and me
Just the way it's supposed to be

Now, don't worry baby
I ain't no maybe
Rain or shine, this love of mine is for you
Yeah, let my arms remind you
I'll always be beside you
Holding on until this ride is through
So away we go, down that forever road

It ain't gonna be easy
We'll both make big mistakes
But, if you love me, trust me
We've got what it takes

Now, don't worry baby
I ain't no maybe
Rain or shine, this love of mine is for you
Yeah, let my arms remind you
I'll always be beside you
Holding on until this ride is through
So away we go, down that forever road
Down that forever road, away we go---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
