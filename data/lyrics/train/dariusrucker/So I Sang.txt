I never was the biggest or the fastest guy
I never hit a home run when the game was tied
I knew from an early age I wasn't going to be
A doctor or the CEO of anything

So I sang, "She Believes In Me"
And I played, "Fire On The Mountain"
'Til I made my fingers bleed
I tried to stand out from the crowd
But most times I just struck out at the plate
So I sang

I wasn't cool enough to be a ladies man
It took me forever just to hold her hand
First time we kissed, she whispered, I love you
But I wasn't brave enough to say, I loved her too

So I sang, "You Are So Beautiful To Me"
And I played every note to "Faithfully"
I loved her with everything
But I couldn't think of anything to say
So I sang

No one believed in me as much as Mom
See, she worked overtime to buy my first guitar
When the angels called her home
My sister asked if I would speak
But there were no words to say how much she meant to me

So I sang, "It Is Well With My Soul"
And I played, "I'm So Tired Of Being Alone"
'Cause those were Mama's favorite songs
And what I felt would take too long to say
So I sang
Yes, I sang
So I sang---
