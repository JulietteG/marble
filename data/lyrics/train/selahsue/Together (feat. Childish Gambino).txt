I was lost on the dark side
Till you crashed into my life
We were scarred by the bright lights
Falling stars through the night sky
I know we're broken parts
But ain't that just who we are

We should be together-gether, yeah
We can reach the sun if we're one, that's easy
Everything's just better, better, yeah
When I'm locked inside
You're the ties that free me
We should be together-gether, yeah
Together we hurt, together we take it
Together we fall, we'll never be breaking
If we were apart, I know that we'd fade away
Together we are, together we make it

Everything that we both know
Summer nights left me so cold
Let me dream of this fair love
All the things that I'm scared of

We should be together-gether, yeah
We can reach the sun if we're one, that's easy
Everything's just better, better, yeah
When I'm locked inside
You're the ties that free me
We should be together-gether, yeah
Together we hurt, together we take it
Together we fall, we'll never be breaking
If we were apart, I know that we'd fade away
Together we are, together we make it

I know we're far apart
I don't know where to start
And I know what the people say
But I choose your love anyway

Yeah, love so good Ye coulda signed
Got the one thing I couldn't buy
Niggas so mad when I walk through
With you on my arm, what they gon' do?
Woman in my life, you're the top two
Hi Mom!
Lights on, lights off
Dylon, rap like this, you're an icon
Blue dream sounding like a pipe bomb
You and me together, maybe we could do it
Worst summer ever but we got through it
Talk about the money, I was getting to it
Where you wanna go, where you wanna go?
Let a nigga know, let a nigga know
They ain't gotta know, they ain't gotta know

We should be together-gether, yeah
We can reach the sun if we're one, that's easy
Everything's just better, better, yeah
When I'm locked inside, you're the ties that free me
We should be together---
