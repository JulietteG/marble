Random wings staying, lurking, searching for the right of me and then bursting...
Bursting...

And to think of...

Random wings staying, lurking, searching for the right of me and then bursting, bursting, bursting...
Bursting.

Random wings staying, lurking, searching for the right of me and then bursting, bursting, bursting...
Burst-Ing

Bursting

Dont even think to take off...---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
