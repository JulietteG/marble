Love, love, love, love, love
I find you're something...

Love, love, love, love, love
I find, I find
Love, love, love, love, love
I Find you're something wonderful
Love, love, love, love, love
I find, I find
Love, love, love, love
I find you're something...

Pulma Gary Payton, Live in your rotation
all your plexy clad Im snapping back upon your station,
keep style elevating, you feelin the sensation
youre higher zone, youre not alone
i know no perimeters, frequency, no limiters
we multiply integers, we back and forth so limitless
Im positive,negative combined with infinity 
you can grab a line on a line this is synergy

Love, love, 
Anything you feel
Love, love
I can feel too
Love, love, love
Anything you feel
I can feel too

You're higher zone, High
You're higher zone (Hands high) *repeat

Hands high, hands high 
Anything you feel 
Hands high, hands high
I can feel too
Hands high, hands high, hands high
Anything you feel 
Hands high, hands high
I can feel too
Hands high---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
