INTRO:
[TobyMac:] 
(I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me) x 3
(I love, I love, I love, I love the way you, the way you)

VERSE 1:
Ive had a long day I just wanna relax 
Dont have time for my friends, no time to chit-chat 
Problems at my job, wonderin what to do 
I know I should be working but Im thinking of You and 
Just when I feel this crazy world is gonna bring me down 
Thats when Your smile comes around

CHORUS:
Oh, I love the way You hold me, by my side Youll always be 
You take each and every day, make it special in some way 
I love the way you hold me, in Your arms Ill always be 
You take each and every day, make it special in some way 
I love You more than the words in my brain can express 
I cant imagine even loving You less 
Lord, I love the way You hold me
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh whoa, I love the way You hold me
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

(I love, I love, I love, I love the way you)

VERSE 2: 
Well You took my day and You flipped it around 
Calmed the tidal wave and put my feet on the ground 
Forever in my heart, always on my mind 
Its crazy how I think about You all of the time 
And just when I think Im bout to figure You out (figure You out) 
You make me wanna sing and shout

(CHORUS)

BRIDGE: 
Im so grateful and thankful for all Youve done 
Wish I could tell You in a short story or poem 
But, all I have is my voice and this guitar 
And You have my heart

CHORUS 2:
Oh, I love the way You hold me, by my side Youll always be 
You take each and every day, make it special in some way 
I love the way you hold me, in Your arms Ill always be 
You take each and every day, every day, every day 
Oh, I love the way You hold me, by my side Youll always be 
You take each and every day, make it oh-so-special 
I love the way you hold me, in Your arms Ill always be 
You take each and every day, make it special in some way 
I love You more than the words in my brain can express 
I cant imagine even loving You less 
Lord, I love the way You hold me
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh whoa, I love the way You hold me
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh I love
