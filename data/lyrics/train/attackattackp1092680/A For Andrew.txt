I have an illness, 
And it is called myself.

I am so desperate.
I'm getting in over my head.

I regret so many things I've done.
The past is to remind me how broken I am.
How broken I am.

How naive I was.
How naive I was.

I've suffered the consequences, 
This world is not for me.
I've suffered the consequences, 
I've failed you, I've failed everyone.

I've put so many things above you, 
But you still are always there for me.
I don't know who I am anymore.
If I even knew who I was, 

How naive I was.
How naive I was.

My head starts pounding, 
My body begins to burn, 

I'm tired.
I'm beat down.
And my hope is dying.

I've suffered the consequences, 
This world is not for me.
I've suffered the consequences, 
I've failed you, I've failed everyone.

I've put so many things above you, 
But you still are always there for me.
I don't know who I am anymore, 
If I even knew who I was.

I've put so many things above you, 
But you still are always there for me
I don't know who I am anymore
If I even knew who I was
