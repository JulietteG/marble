YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

You never said, that this would be easy
(that this would be!)
So go on live!
You never said that this would be easy
(that this would be)
So go on live!

This is the best part of the message!
And it only took ONE!

He lived for what He's worth!
And that's one thing you'll know!

He died for what He loved!
And what he loved was YOU!

I'll wait for You!
(You know I'll wait for you, you know I'll wait for you!)
I'll wait for You!
(You know I'll wait for you, you know I'll wait for...)

You never said that this would be easy,

So go on live!
You never said that this would be easy,
(that this would be)
So go on live!

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

BOW YOUR HEAD!
GO ON LIVE!

This is the time to let yourself go,
Lord pick me off the ground.
You never said this would be simple,
So put me in and turn around!

Woah, oh, woah, wa uh uh oh

You never said this would be simple...
THAT THIS WOULD BE...---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
