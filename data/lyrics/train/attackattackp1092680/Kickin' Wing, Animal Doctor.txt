We havent had this much fun since spring break 96
Thats right I said it
hahahaha
Lets do this....oh yea
Im rockn im rollin im ready to go
Im up off the stage im singin the notes
Are you ready to get lost tonight and lose all control!

When in doubt when in doubt
He will save you!
And you can be
What you throw
On. My. Head!
Ill tape this up and tear it down
Youll look so wonderful dead!
Ill tape this up and bring you down
This is not a test!

So sad to see the way that you look at him
I bet its ok
you like lookin thin!
He sees right through you!
He sees right through you!
Come on!
Tell me the truth!
Tell me the time!

This the lie!
This is the way...that you
Wanted me to be!
This is the lie!
This the strike...and you
Dont get three!

Ive takn all this time.....
To show.....
To you my life!
Too late to memorize!
Youll never memorize!
Please dont forget me!

Now you have taught me how to live by grace
And I will do this untill my dying day!
How could i ever fall away from you?
You have taught me how to live like christ
And how to show my face in the worst of times
And all i can say is thank you!

Take it here i owe you
all my....affection!
Take it here I owe you
all my....affection!---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
