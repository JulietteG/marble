Seeing everyone's true face
Makes me wish they would keep their masks on.
Cause I don't want to know
Who you really are
I thought you would've learned your lesson by now.

True face exposed
Dark motives in the light
Was listening too scary for you?
You haven't changed, you never will.
You never will

You and I will never be the same
You said you tried, but you never changed.
You can hide and say you're not to blame
I thought you would've learned your lesson by now.
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/attack_attack/i_swear_ill_change.html ]
I was wrong
Something in me still has hope for you
I don't know why
Everyone is not as good as they seem
Trust in me, trust in me

I never knew
That lying came so natural to you
Cause I can't bare to see
The man you're gonna be
I thought you would've learned your lesson by now

You and I will never be the same
You said you tried, but you never changed.
You can hide and say you're not to blame
I thought you would've learned your lesson by now.
You and I will never be the same
You said you tried, but you never changed.
You can hide and say you're not to blame
I thought you would've learned your lesson by now.---Lyrics submitted by janae.
