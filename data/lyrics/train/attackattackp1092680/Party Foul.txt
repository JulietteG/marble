You lied to me.
You tried to be
everything I would want,
but everything you couldn't be.

The two worlds that you have made,
have suddenly collided.
So you'll have the chance to lead,
a new life.

Everything that I would want,
everything you couldn't be.

This is your cop-out to your life.
I will be the end of everything you love.
It rips my heart out, and I cant take anymore.
Heart out, I'm lying on the floor.

I can't, I can't believe this.
I can't, I can't believe this.
I can't, I can't believe this.
I can't believe this has happened.
I can't believe this is happening.
I can't believe this is happening.

I can't believe that this is happening to me!
I thought that you would be, everything I need!

The two worlds that you have made,
have suddenly collided.
So save yourself and make a lie,
I wouldn't be believing.

You want me back,
now that I'm on
my own again.

"Please enjoy the music while your party is reached."

You thought that you could be my bride,
but no, you lied.---Lyrics submitted by nders.
