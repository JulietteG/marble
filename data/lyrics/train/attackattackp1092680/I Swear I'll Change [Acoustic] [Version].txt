Seeing everyone's true face
Makes me wish they would keep their masks on
Cause I don't wanna know, who you really are
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now

True face exposed, dark motives in the mind
Was listening too scary for you?
You haven't changed, you never will
You never will

You and I will never be the same
You say you try, but you never change
You can hide, and say you're not to blame
I thought you have learned your lesson by now

I was wrong, something in me still has hope for you
I don't know why everyone is not as good as they seem
Trust in me, trust in me

I never knew that lying came so natural to you
'Cause I can't bear to see, the man you're gonna be
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now

You and I will never be the same
You say you try, but you never change
You can hide, and say you're not to blame
I thought you have learned your lesson by now

You and I will never be the same
You say you try, but you never change
You can hide, and say you're not to blame
I thought you have learned your lesson by now---Lyrics submitted by Shilo Willeatyourface Emerson.
