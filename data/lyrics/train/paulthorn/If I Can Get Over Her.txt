I had a puppy love crush
when I was ten years old
Her name was Lisa Janine,
she lived across the road
I caught her with a cub scout in a little blue hat
they were pushin' each other on the swing out back
I remember how it almost killed me
How could she do me like that?
I never thought I'd be the same
But now I look back and I laugh

If I can get over her
I can get over you
It's just gonna take some time
these things they always do
Even though it left scars on my heart
Time has healed the wounds
If I can get over her
I can get over you---Lyrics submitted by Daniel Stevens.
