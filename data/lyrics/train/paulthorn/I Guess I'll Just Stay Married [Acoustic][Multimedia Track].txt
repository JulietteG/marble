I got lucky on my birthday
My wife reluctantly let me have my way
This is for you
Do what you must do
Let me know when youre through

I thought things would change
When we tied the knot
But the life I dreamed of
Aint what I got

When she says no
She means no
Hell No!

I couldnt get laid when I was single
If you threw me in a womans prison
I am the poster child 
For total rejection

Celibacy is the cross that I must carry
I couldnt get laid when I was single 
So I guess Ill just stay married

Ive gotta a bulldog 
He lives on a chain
I know what hes going thru
I feel his pain
He dont have no fun
On that doggy run
He never gets none

Hes got potential 
If he could get free
But hes on a short leash 
Just like me
He goes through life
With hungry eyes
Watching bitches go by

I couldnt get laid when I was single
If you threw me in a womans prison
I am the poster child 
For total rejection

Celibacy is the cross that I must carry
I couldnt get laid when I was single 
So I guess Ill just stay married
