I know a woman she lives down the road 
Her husband passed away 2 years ago
She has lonely nights when teardrops fall
So pick up your telephone give her a call

Chorus:
What have you done to lift somebody up?
When have you helped someone who's got it rough?
Oh we can change the world with a little love
What have you done to lift somebody up?

A little boy struck out in a baseball game
Couldn't face his father he felt so ashamed
Daddy said don't worry I'm proud of you son
You don't have to win to be number one!

Chorus

Instrumental break

Bridge:  
We all need to do a little more
Cause you can't be rich if your neighbors are poor
