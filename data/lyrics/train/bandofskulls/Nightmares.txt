I was afraid of coming undone
Being a burden, being a son
I was afraid of the look in my eye
The tears on your face in the desolate night
'Cause when you're afraid of everything
Everything is a start for nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares

Oh oh oh ooh
If I die tomorrow, would you be upset?
Or would you be the one coming to get me?!
Follow by the wish of never changing mood
Tell me it's alright

If come reason, if you could stay
To put up your faith in the palm of my hands
I will protect you, I will defend
So it never gets you ever again
Everything is a start for nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares

Oh oh oh ooh
If I die tomorrow, would you be upset?
Or would be the one coming to get me?!
Follow by the wish of never changing mood
Tell me it's alright!

Maybe I'm just dreaming
Maybe I was wrong,
Maybe I was right
'Cause I can't imagine distances in our faiths
Is there any?

Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Nightmares, nightmares
Oh oh oh ooh---
