Like a cold cold sweat alright
I got the fever for you tonight
and I can't stop no, I won't stop,
How can I stop when nothing is enough

I got this feeling in my bones
something loving god only knows
and I can't sleep oh I won't sleep
How can I sleep when nothing is enough

So do it, what you waiting for?
surely enough to go on
You got me yearning, like never before
and I don't want to lose love

You got to live and let it knock you out
I haven't learnt so don't ask me what it's all about
I can't speak and I won't speak
How can I speak when nothing is enough

There's still a cold cold sweat alright
There's still a fever for you alright
and I can't stop, no I won't stop
How can I stop when nothing is enough

So do it what you waiting for
surely enough to go on
You got me yearning, like never before
and I don't want to lose love ---
