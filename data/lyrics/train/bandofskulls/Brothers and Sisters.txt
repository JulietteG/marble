I am not against
Meet the judge before you start the race
Meet the middle race
While your mother pays attention, aye
You're guiding too fast

And although I am ahead
We're not brothers and sisters in the end

I will run away
The contention never held me down
Smile right in your face
The thought of being held here
Put your ear near, racing in the air

And although I am ahead
We're not brothers and sisters in the end---
