Jesus is here right now
Jesus is here right now
He is here to meet your needs
To set the captives free 
Oh, oh, oh Jesus is here right now
(Repeat)

Verse 1:
If you feel all hope is gone
And you're fighting the battle alone
And depression threatens your very soul
Jesus will visit you  today 
Take the dark clouds away 
Oh, oh, oh Jesus is here right now

Chorus:
Jesus is here right now
Jesus is here right now
He is here to meet your needs
To set the captives free 
Oh, oh, oh Jesus is here right now

Verse 2:
If you feel nobody cares 
And life has been unfair
And You can't find peace of mind nowhere
He is here to pull your hand
Pick you up and let you stand
Oh, oh, oh Jesus is here right now

Chorus:
Jesus is here right now
Jesus is here right now
He is here to meet your needs
To set the captives free 
Oh, oh, oh Jesus is here right now

Ending:
Oh He's here
Oh He's here, right now
He can bring you peace
He can bring you joy
He can bring you love
He's here---Lyrics submitted by Ifeoluwa Jegede.
