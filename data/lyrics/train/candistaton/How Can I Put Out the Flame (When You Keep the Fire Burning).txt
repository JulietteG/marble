you keep sayin
it's all over
ah yeah
that the feeling is all gone

but you keep stirring
up my desires
everytime that we're alone

im trying
so hard to forget you
but you just keep me
oh you keep me stringing along

tell me how
how can i put out the flame
baby baby baby baby
when you keep the fire burning on

i stop trying 
to see you
but still 
you just keep coming around
oh youre not making it
any easier
oh no
for me, to put you down
no no no no no no

you know
you know, you know how i feel about you baby
you know my love 
ohhhhhh my love for you
is still going strong

so tell me how
how can i put out the flame
baby baby baby
when you keep the fire burning on

why dont you just leave me alone?

how can i put out the flame
oh no
when you keep the fire burning on---Lyrics submitted by ANGELA ALDATZ.
