The spirit of the lord God is upon me
For he has anointed me to bring glad tidings to the meek
To bind the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives
And the opening of the prisons to them that are bound

It's the anointing that makes the difference
Once you know him, you'll never be the same
You cant live without him, once he's rested upon you
He will teach you how to walk in Jesus name

In my name you shall cast out demons
And in my name you shall speak with new tongues
You shall lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover
All these signs shall follow you in my name

The yoke is broken by the anointing
(I tell you today)
Once you've known him..no..no..no
You'll never be the same..no..no..no
You cant live without him, once he's rested upon you..no..no..no
He will teach you how to walk in Jesus name

He'll teach you how to live
He'll teach you how to talk
In Jesus name......in Jesus name---Lyrics submitted by Falope Iyanu.
