When I think about you, baby
I want you here
I wanna put my arms around you
And feel you, dear

You have touched my heart
I'm so in love
You're the only girl
I'm thinking of, ooh

[CHORUS]
I call my baby on the phone
Got to leave a message
Just to let her know
That if she ever feels alone
To dial my heart
And if by chance
You're not at home
You can reach me, baby
By the nearest pay phone
I gotta cross my fingers
And pray you'll know
To dial my heart

Dial my heart
Just dial my heart
Yeah, yeah

Can we talk it about, baby
Do you have the time
I said am I the only homeboy
That's on your mind, woo
Cause I'm alone
And I can't sleep at night
And I won't sleep until
You're by my side, yeah

[Repeat CHORUS]

Just dial my heart
You can dial my heart
Just dial my heart

[Repeat CHORUS 2x]

I've just got to let you know
That I'll never let you go
Call me when you have the time
Baby, won't you please be mine

Oh, my baby, let her know
Just dial it, baby
Dial it, dial it
Dial it, baby, dial it
Dial it, dial it
Dial it, baby

It don't matter where you are
If you're near or far
All you gotta do is
Just dial my heart

Lets talk about it, baby
On the telephone
Call me, baby
You'll never be alone

Dial it, dial it
Dial it, baby, dial it
Dial it, dial it
Dial it, baby
You'll never be alone

[Repeat CHORUS]

You can dial it anytime---Lyrics submitted by Arreon Young.
