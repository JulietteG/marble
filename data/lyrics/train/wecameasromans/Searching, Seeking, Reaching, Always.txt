I always knew I'd never reach perfection,
and if I ever did then I wasn't trying hard enough.
Because there is always something more to reach for.

And every end is just the start to something else.
I think that if we ever stopped seeking out
what it is that keeps us growing,
then we'll never stop searching for the piece.
The heart that will keep us loving.

I'm always searching for

I'm always searching.
This path's not easy to walk upon.
I'm always seeking.
Knowing that I'm eager to carry on.
I'm searching, seeking, reaching for something more.
I'll be better than before.
Reaching for something more

So if we keep seeking out what is right,
moving on after being set back,
searching out what keeps us strong.
Searching out, and always building up the things that we lack.
This path we choose is not the easiest to walk upon
And knowing that I am more eager to continue on
because I know that when I reach the end
I'll be better than before

Reaching for something more
I'm always searching

I'm always searching
This path's not easy to walk upon
I'm always seeking
Knowing that I'm eager to carry on
I'm searching, seeking, reaching for something more
I'll be better than before
Reaching for something more---Lyrics submitted by Evelyn.
