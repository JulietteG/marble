Saturday night, we look alright, we're going out
Boring
Paris France, London town, NYC
Boring 

Nothing thrills us anymore
No one kills us anymore
Life is such a chore
When it's boring

Sexy boy, girl on girl, menage a trois
Boring
Marijuana, cocaine, heroin
Boring

Nothing thrills us anymore
No one kills us anymore
Life is such a chore
When it's boring

Galliano, Donatella, Dolce and Gabanna
Boring
Caviar, escargot, Dom Perignon
Boring
Love of my life, bear your child, everything I ever wanted
Boring

Nothing thrills us anymore
No one kills us anymore
Life is such a chore
When it's boring

Nothing thrills us anymore
No one kills us anymore
Life is such a chore
When it's boring---Lyrics submitted by Modesto.
