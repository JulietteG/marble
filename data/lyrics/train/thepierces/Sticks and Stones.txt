Hey domino,
I am stopping you from falling
1-2-3 Dont you dare go down
Hey waterfall,
Oh can you hear me calling?
3-2-1 dont you dare touch the ground

Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want

Well, sticks and stones will break your bones
And leave you lying in the mud
But you get scared when were alone
Like I might suck your blood
Well I could tell you a witchs spell
But it just might blow your top
Then you start to run just as Im having fun
And its awfully hard to stop
Its awfully hard to stop

Sun in the sky,
I am stopping you from burning
All we need is stars and moon
Clock on the wall,
I will keep your hands from turning
Or this night will end too soon

Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want

Well, sticks and stones will break your bones
And leave you lying in the mud
But you get scared when were alone
Like I might suck your blood
And I could tell you a witchs spell
But it just might blow your top
Then you start to run just as Im having fun
And its awfully hard to stop
Its awfully hard to stop
Its just too hard to stop

Ooooh
Hey lover boy,
Oh, now do you believe me?
Thats not all that I can do
Sit back down,
Im afraid we wont be leaving
Cant undo my spell on you

Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want
Im the one you want

Well sticks and stones will break your bones
And leave you lying in the mud
But you get scared when were alone
Like I might suck your blood
And I could tell you a witchs spell
But you just might blow your top
Then you start to run just as Im having fun
And its awfully hard to stop

Well sticks and stones will break your bones
And leave you lying in the mud
But you get scared when were alone
Like I might suck your blood
And I could tell you a witchs spell
But you just might blow your top
Then you start to run just as Im having fun
And its awfully hard to stop
Its awfully hard to stop
Its just too hard to stop
I dont think I can stop---Lyrics submitted by erin.
