VERSE ONE
We'd be so less fragile
If we're made from metal
And our hearts from iron
and our minds from steel
If we built an armor for our tender bodies
Could we love each other
Would we Strive to feel

CHORUS
And You want Three Wishes
One to fly the heavens
One to Swim Like fishes
And then
One your saving for a Rainy Day
If your Lover ever takes her Love away.

mmmmm mmm mmmmm mmm

VERSE TWO
You say you want to know her
Like a lover
And undo her damage 
she'll be new again
Soon you'll find that if you
Try to save her
It renews her anger
You will never win

CHORUS
Then You want Three Wishes
You want never bitter and all delicious
And then one your saving for a rainy day
If your Lover ever takes her love away

mmmmm mmm mmmmm

CHORUS
And you want three wishes
One to fly the heavens
One to swim like fishes
You want never bitter
and all delicious
And a clear conscience
And all its blisses
You want one true lover with a thousand kisses
You want soft and gentle and never vicious
And then One your saving for a rainy Day
If your Lover ever takes her love away.

mmmmm mmm mmmmm ---Lyrics submitted by Shantelle.
