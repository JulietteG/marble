We could bring a blanket for the grass
Cover up your eyes so you don't see
If you let me go I'm running fast
One two three count one two three
We could watch the black birds cross the skies
We could count the leaves left on the trees
We could count the teardrops in our eyes
One two three yeah one two three
One two three yeah one two three
Now you know now you know
How I feel and I won't back down

Prick your finger on a spinning wheel
But dont make a sound
Drop of blood and now you're taken
For all time
With a kiss you will awaken
And you'll be mine you'll be mine you'll be mine

I could always stay and work it out
Wondering if you still wanted me
But there are so many things to doubt
One two three count one two three
Think that for a moment you were mine
I know that you saw what we could be
But then you went and changed your mind
One two three yeah one two three
One two three yeah one two three
Now you know now you know
How I feel and I won't back down

Prick your finger on a spinning wheel
But don't make a sound
Drop of blood and now you're taken
For all time
With a kiss you will awaken
And you'll be mine---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
