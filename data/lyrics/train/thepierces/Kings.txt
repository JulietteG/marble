It strikes fear in the heart of the fun men
Might not even move another
While a stranger gets your head
You turn your back upon your brother

And you know
You know
You know
You know

We all wonder how your star was
And the valleys at our feet
We are counting down the hours
Til our life and love will meet

And you know
You know
You know
You know
You know
It's gonna take sometime

If we want to
We could what Kings do
I can feel the Earth move when you speak
If we fight through all the things we once knew
Everything could change for me and you
We could do what Kings do

You feel unworthy of the throne
You have forgotten who you are
We all have a part of angels
And we fell from the same star
The heart of the lion
And the lips of the child
One part of you is dying
And the other running wild

And you know
You know
You know
You know
You know
It's gonna take sometime

If we want to
We could what Kings do
I can feel the Earth move when you speak
If we fight through all the things we once knew
Everything could change for me and you
We could do what Kings do
We could do what Kings do
We could do what Kings do
We could do what Kings do

It's gonna take sometime
It's gonna take sometime

If we want to
We could what Kings do
I can feel the Earth move when you speak
If we fight through all the things we once knew
Everything could change for me and you

If we want to
We could what Kings do
I can feel the Earth move when you speak
If we fight through all the things we once knew
Everything could change for me and you
We could do what Kings do
We could do what Kings do
We could do what Kings do
We could do what Kings do---
