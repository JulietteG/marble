did you ever see your self in my eyes
did you ever think that maybe i'd be lost with out  yeah
did you ever think that i was alright
you knew it all along mmmm

did you ever try to sing to my songs
did you ever take  a walk i wasn't walking with you yeah
did you ever love me just to be loved
knew it all along
i didn't try

sometimes i like to be alone
sometimes i try to telephone

lover come back to me yeah
lover come back to me yeah
in your arms is were i need to be
I'm alone i am alone
raging sea

i want to taste your bronze skins delights
did you ever wanna be the sun, the sun that browns me yeah
did you ever think i might decided to ask you to stay
baby put up a fight

sometimes i like to be alone
sometimes i try to telephone

lover you
lover come back to me yeah 
lover come back to me yeah
cause in your arms is where i need to be 
i 'm alone i am alone 
raging sea

lover you
lover come back to me 
lover come back to me yeah 
lover come back to me yeah

in your arms is were i need to be
i am alone i am alone in this raging sea yeah

lover you come back to me yeah
lover you come back to me
lover you come back
cause i'm alone i am alone
raging sea---Lyrics submitted by Maureen.
