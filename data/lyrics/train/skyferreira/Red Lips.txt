Red lips
You're ten a penny
Cheap shot
Spreading your legs for the boys
Watch out
'Cause someone will beat you the same
Freak out 
Mmmmm
Wash out your mouth

Such a big girl
Such a big news
Such a big talk
Your number is up
If you like it or not
What a shock

Little bitch
Growing so bored of your feds
'Cause soon gonna lay you down 
Enough for the ones
And no one remembers your name
Too bad
Mmmmm
Such a confidence

Such a big girl
Such big news
Such a big talk
Your number is up
If you like it or not
Your number is up
If you like it or not
Your number is up
If you like it or not
Take a walk

Such a big girl
Such big news
Such a big talk
Your number is up
If you like or not
Your number is up
If you like it or not
Your number is up
If you like it or not
What a shock---Lyrics submitted by Laura Young.
