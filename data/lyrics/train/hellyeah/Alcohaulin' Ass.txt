a little bit of sunshine
a little bit of booze
a little bit of me
and a little bit of you
a little bit of country
a little bit of blues
a little slice of heaven
an little piece of you, come on

alcohaulin' ass
Pour another drink in my glass
alcohaulin' ass 
alcohaul...in' ass 

A little bit thirsty
A little bit used
A little bit of whiskey 
An a little pinch of chew
A little bit tired
An a bad attitude
A little bit of drinkin
An another piece of you

Yeah Come on
Alcohaulin' ass 
Pour another drink in my glass
Alcohaulin' ass 
Alcohaulin' ass

You drove me to it
So theres nothing i could do
you pushed me down
split me right in two
now i found the long hard road
carried the weight of you
boy oh boy god damn 
theres only one thing left to do..

a little bit of alcohaulin'ass 
ALCOHAULIN'ASS
Pour another drink in my glass...
