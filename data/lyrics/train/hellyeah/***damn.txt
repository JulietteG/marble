Fucking bad ass, full of attitude, just another
Typical day and another fucking bad mood.
Fuck it all, crush it all, I'll be damned if I don't,
And I'll be damned if I do.
Fuckin' sick of it, I don't give a shit, trapped in
A miserable space, on this ball of dirt with all of you.
I'm moving out, I'm moving on, it's a lost cause,
It's our last call.

Now everything's over
Now everything's over

Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)
Everything's your fault, everything's your way.
Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)
Everything's your law, don't try to deny it.

Fucking smile and wave, your big business suit.
All the pain games you play, just one more fucking bad move
Fuck you all who lie, cheat and steal, we're all dead if you don't, we're all dead if you do.
Eat your young, left to waste, insane leading the way, brainwashed to kill for you.
Over all, I'm over you, we're a lost cause, it's our last call.

Now everything's over
Now everything's over

Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)
Everything's your fault, everything's your way.
Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)
Everything's your law, don't try to deny it.

They're all your mistakes,
They're all your mistakes,
They're all your mistakes,
It's all your fault.
Your fault, your fault, your fault
All your fault.

Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)
Everything's your fault, everything's your way.
Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)
Everything's your law, don't try to deny it.
Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)
Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)
Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)
Can I get a god damn? (God damn!)

Everything's your fault!---Lyrics submitted by maggie.
