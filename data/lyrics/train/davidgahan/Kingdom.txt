Can you hear me coming
Open the door it's only me
I have that desperate feeling
A trouble is where I'm going to be
I know you hear me knocking,

So open the door and set me free

if there is kingdom behind it all
is there a God who loves us all
Do we believe in love at all
I'm still pretending I'm not a fool

So in your infinitive wisdome
You show me how life should be
with all that your love and glory
it doesn't mean that much too me

if there is kingdom behind it all
is there a God who loves us all
Do we believe in love at all
I'm still pretending I'm not a fool---Lyrics submitted by tanja.
