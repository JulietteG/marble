Over the Mountains
They're begging us to stay
We took the poison
To remember yesterday

Come under the river
Wash it all away
Deep into the garden
We change

The shadows waiting
For those that find the way
Someone's arriving
It happens every day

Follow the Mountains
To every canyons meet the sky
It takes a brave one
To love this mind

Now we are the wild 
Get ready for the rain
Its just a gentle poison
So let it all in

Come under the river
Wash it all away
Deep inside the garden
We change---Lyrics submitted by Kureasha.
