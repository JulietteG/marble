You were afraid of everything that meant something to me
And then inside a memory appeared and said to me
Don't be afraid of the way things are supposed to be

Nobody told me its okay to grow
I didn't know
Far from the sounds of the city she knows
I didn't know

Honestly, 
did you really think I'd let you leave
Honestly, 
did you really think of me

I was afraid of everything you came to know and love
I didn't know there was anything you were scared of

Nobody told me I had to grow
I didn't know
Far from the sounds of the city, I know
I didn't know

Honestly,
did you really think I would let you leave?
Honestly,
did you even think of me?
(2x)

I was afraid of everything you came to know and love

Honestly, 
did you really think I would let you leave?
Honestly, 
did you ever think of me?
