Keeping all times now, remove the sound
Crash in violent waves
Curious we breathe, this house can't take it
Take it now

Below, below
One are a million
A gilded bacchanal, a tyrant's graphic call
All catacombs

How long did it take
To fall into all the rapture in memory
At the same time, at the same time now?

Seeing all things now, shake the ground
Tangle every phase
Mysteries it seems this world can't fake it
Fake it now

Below, below
One are a million secret waiting eyes
A beb of hidden tides
To wash away

How long did it take
To fall into all the rapture in memory
At the same time, at the same time now?---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
