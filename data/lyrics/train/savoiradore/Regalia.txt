High in the air dusk cocoons will get
The rust all get left, fly like a bear
Pop pop Regalia
They own all we know

Now you know all of my old names
Now you see that everything's the same

I keep you there, panic through the wild
Rider in the dark
Fall to the ground
Pop pop Athena
They own all we know

Now you know all of my old names
Now you see that everything's the same
Becoming one together in the secret fire
Where you were made and everything remains---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
