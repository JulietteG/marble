You don't belong here
Looking so far from home
But I know all the back ways out
Just follow where I go

We'll steal away and have some fun
And you will be the only one

You want me to believe you
Even though the things you say aren't true
But I can play this game too
So tell me what you want to

What can I say
It was a dark, miserable day
But maybe if you stayed with me
We could share this pain OK

It's not that I want you to cry
But I love the look of teardrops in your eyes

You want me to believe you
Even though the things you say aren't true
But I can play this game too
So tell me what you want to---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
