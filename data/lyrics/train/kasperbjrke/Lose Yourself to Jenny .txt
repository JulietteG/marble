And you don't want to lose yourself to Jenny,
You know that she will ask you all you've got
Afraid that she is worth every penny
Afraid that she will drink until you drop

And even though your hands are shaking
To you it really means a lot
It's possible that you could be mistaking
But you're also nervous that you're not

Now I know you don't like to be laughed at
And I can see your eyes are getting wet
But I want you to hold your tears back
Weve got time to worry when we're dead

I will shut the lid on my eight track
Knowing that it isn't over yet
And I will leave an address for contact
For if you feel you're in over your head

Cause you don't want to lose yourself to Jenny
And you know she will ask you all you've got
Afraid that she is worth every penny
Afraid that she will drink until you drop

And even though your hands are shaking
To you it really means a lot
It's possible that you could be mistaking
But you're also nervous that you're not

Cause you don't want to lose yourself to Jenny
And you know she will ask you all you've got
Afraid that she is worth every penny
Afraid that she will drink until you drop

Cause you don't want to lose yourself to Jenny
And you know she will ask you all you've got
Afraid that she is worth every penny
Afraid that she will drink until you drop

And even though your hands are shaking
To you it really means a lot
It's possible that you could be mistaking
But you're also nervous that you're not---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
