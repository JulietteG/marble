I...smile...when Rosie comes to see me
And I'm sad when Rosie goes away
Cuz, Rosie brings the sunshine

I...smile...cuz Rosie let's me be me
Love grows with Rosie every day
Cuz Rosie brings the sunshine
And I'm in love with Rosie
Cuz Rosie treats me good
Making people smile that's Roses art
I fell in love with Rosie
Anybody would...Rosie grows like flowers in my heart

I...smile...when Rosie comes to see me
And I'm sad when Rosie goes away
Cuz Rosie brings the sunshine---
