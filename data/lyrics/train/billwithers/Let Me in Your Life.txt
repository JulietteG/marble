I only want to love you
Please don't push me away
Let me in your life

I wasn't there when he hurt you
So why should I have to pay
Let me in your life

I want to share your tomorrow
So I must beg you today
If he's the cause of your sorrow
Be glad that he's gone away

I need someone let me love you
Please don't push me away
Let me in your life

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la---
