She spends the daytime being a lady
But when the nighttime rolls around
She's got some games to play
She wants to get on down

Get down, down
Get down, down
Get down, down, down, down, down

Don't fall in love, love;
Nothin' to say
Won't let your story get off the ground
Don't let your feelin's get in the way
She wants to get on down

Get down, down
Get down, down
Get down, down, down, down, down

Never could stand to be tied to a lover too long
Hurry to play but plan before the day to be gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

Down, get down
Down, get down,
Down, get down
Down, get down, down, down, down, down

Don't fall in love, love;
Nothin' to say
Won't let your story get off the ground
Don't let your feelin's get in the way
She wants to get on down---
