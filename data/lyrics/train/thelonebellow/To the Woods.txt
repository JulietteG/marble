You were golden
Filled with power
Steps you took they
Set on fire
You were leaving
Losing something
Taking in your
Downward spiral

I would watch you
In the moonlight
Soft leaves stepping
Towards the midnight
Through the wet grass
To the woods
Far behind you
Where I stood
The house of cards we
Stacked with care is falling
Time to think of all that's
Good is calling

Oohhh

There you saw me
Barely breathing
Here you say
I'm fine with leaving
You were golden
Filled with power
Walking towards your
Final hour---
