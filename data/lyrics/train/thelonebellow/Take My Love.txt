You're no sunset, you're no lair
You're the beauty you admire
Burning love hope and desire
You're the woods at night on fire
Oh I miss you when it's cold out
Church bells ring I hear you sing out
You're no broken record turning
You're a wild melody
I know I might not be the one you take
Take my love
Take my love

When you told me you can't sleep
Count your sins instead of sheep
Count the ways that you feel weak
but that is not what I see
You're no records, you're a fighter
_ the _ by your on power
Sound it loud above the water
You're a wild melody

I know I might not be the one you take
I've got a heart that ain't afraid to break
Take my love
Take my love
Take my love

_ the windows as you hate
Walls you've built up in flames
Hear the roof cry as it caves
All it's power on your face
No one's had you're heart before
Felt that breathin on your floor
Felt the wolf at your front door
Felt that blood inside you boil

You're no sun shake? you're no lair
You're the beauty I admire
You're the woods at night on fire
Burning love, hope, and desire.
Oh I miss you when it's cold out
Church bells ring I hear you sing out
You're no broken record turning
You're a wild melody

Take my love
Take my love
Take my love
Take my love---
