Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

It's kinda feeling like crunch time
'Cause we're getting close
I'm thinking that you and I need some time alone
We should run up and jump in
'Cause the water is warm
I really wanna say that we should wait
I'm so torn
'Cause if I'm not with you tonight
You'll be goin' round in my mind
Why do we try?
We do it 'cause it feels right

If you just, just give me one more reason to love you
Then I swear, I'm so there
You should just, just kiss me 'cause you really want to
Then I swear, I'm so there
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm so there
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm so there

See you don't want to waste it
'Cause it's hotter than gold
I'm thinking that you and I need to rock the boat
'Cause if I'm not with you tonight
You'll be goin' round in my mind
Why do we try?
We do it 'cause it feels right

If you just just give me one more reason to love you
Then I swear, I'm so there
You should just, just kiss me 'cause you really want to
Then I swear, I'm so there
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm so there
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm so there

Once I feel that love, yeah
There will be no turning back
'Cause we started something
See the fire turn to black
We know that it's bad
But I like that, oh

If you just, just give me one more reason to love you
Then I swear, I'm so there
You should just, just kiss me 'cause you really want to
Then I swear, I'm so there
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm so there
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm so there

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm so there
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm so there---
