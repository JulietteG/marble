Watching puddles gather rain
Theres no better place to lay
Shes as fine as dandelions blowing in the wind
Shes not thinkin' about anything...
She floats
Floats...

Wearing black patent mary janes
She steps out in to the rain
She's as dry as clear blue skies
Swallowing you whole
God knows secrets though I'm told
She floats

ahhh... ahhh...

She's as fine as dandelions blowing in the wind
Shes not thinkin she's listening
She floats... She floats... Floats...
Floats...
She floats... She floats... Floats...
Floats...---Lyrics submitted by rachel.
