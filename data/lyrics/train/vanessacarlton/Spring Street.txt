Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah
Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah

I was heading down to Spring Street with a suitcase in my hand
Filled with love and life and grand illusion,
I knew you'd understand
I left you by the stairwell
And your eyes were wet with tears
Mother, you knew you had to let me go,
Even after all these years

And we sing
Nah, nah-nah-nah, nah nah nah
She said
Nah-nah-nahnah nah nah nah
Walk on
Nah-nah nah, nah, nah nah nah
You're alright
Nah-nah, nah, nah nah nah nah

And I found myself a new life
I've been living with some friends
We hold on to dreams and live like kings,
Like the days will never end
I left him by the statue and his eyes were filled with tears
Lover, you knew you had to let me go
Even after all these years
And we sing

Nah-nahnah-nah nah nah nah
He said
Nah-nah, nah, nah, nah nah nah
Walk on
Nah-nah, nah, nah, nah nah nah
You're alright
Nah-nah, nah, nah nah nah nah

Everything changes,
Friends become strangers
What we hold so dear slips away
The past keeps on fading,
But I'll never forget you
It's hard to see that you're a part of me
Even when we have to say

Nah-nah, nah, nah,nah nah nah
Walk on
Nah-nah, nah, nah nah nah nah nah
We sing
Nah-nah, nah, nah, nah nah nah
Well alright
Nah-nah, nah, nah nah nah nah

And I moved out of the city
To start a family of my own
When I look into my daughter's eyes,
I don't feel so alone
And as I walk her down to Spring Street
She holds on to my hand
Mother, you knew my eyes would be wet with tears and now I understand

Nah-nah, nah, nah, nah nah nah
And I said
Nah-nah, nah, nah, nah nah nah
Walk on
Nah-nah, nah, nah, nah nah nah
Thank you
Nah-nah, nah, nah, nah nah nah
Walk on
You're alright
Can't hold on
Nah-nah,nah, nah, nah nah nah---Lyrics submitted by Lucy.
