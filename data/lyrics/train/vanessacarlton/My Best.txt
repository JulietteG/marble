we scream and shout and try to make it last
though it didnt work out, i dont love you any less
my lover or friend, i wont ever tell
our secreats safe an unspoken citadel
and in these broken times, well, its so easy to forget
so i sing to remind, upon my shoulder you can rest
cause ill always give you my best
a sidewalks path leads me to you though we dont look back we hold on to a truth
and in these broken times i promise i will not forget
though your not mine apon your sholder i can rest
cuase you always give me your best
like a promise kept
its like you never left
its like you never left
and though its been so long, i cant of ever seem to forget
all it takes is a song and i could swear i hear your steps
down the hall echoes a past that leaves an ache, its never left
cause i gave you my best
its like you never left
its like you never left
we scream and shout and try to make it last---Lyrics submitted by Mickey.
