Cradling stones hold fire bright
as crickets call out to the moonlight
as you lean in to steal a kiss
i'll never need more than this

We all share the pain of our histories
but the ache goes away if you could see 
This night under stars, well, i call it peace

if you say, i'll never need more than this
the trees grow thick you can barely see through
but the forst bestows the simplest of truths
you think you'll be happy if i grant one more wish
want so mych in this life there's so much to be

we sail through our youth so impatiently until we see
that the years move along 
and soldiers and heroes come home and they carry a song,
Don't live in forgotten times may this always remind you of the sea 
under the skies blue looking glass
let's make this story, let's live in the glory
time, it fades away , precious as a song

cause someday we'll be gone 
cradling stones hold fire bright
as we watch the glow of the morning light
someday our bones here they will lie, and so we sing
as the years move along and soldiers and heroes come home
and they carry a song
let's make this our story, let's live in the glory
time, it fades away precious as a song cause someday we'll be gone---Lyrics submitted by nena.
