no sweeter name than the name of Jesus
no sweeter name have i ever known
no sweeter name than the name of Jesus

no sweeter name than the name of Jesus 
no sweeter name have i ever known 
no sweeter name than the name of Jesus

oh you are the light to my heart and my soul 
you are the light to the darkness around me
you are the hope to the hopeless and broken
you are the only truth and way..

Jesus,Jesus,Jesus, Jesus......---Lyrics submitted by silver juneau.
