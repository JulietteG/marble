You hold my every moment
You calm my raging seas
You walk with me through fire
And heal all my disease

I trust in You
I trust in You

I believe, You're my healer
I believe, You are all I need
And I believe, You're my portion
I believe, You're more than enough for me
Jesus You're all I need

You hold my every moment
You calm my raging seas
You walk with me through fire
And heal all my disease

I trust in You
Lord I trust in You

I believe, Youre my Healer
I believe, You are all I need
I believe, Youre my Portion
I believe, You're more than enough for me
Jesus You are all I need

Nothing is impossible for You
Nothing is impossible
Nothing is impossible for You 
You hold my world in Your Hands
Repeat

I believe, Youre my Healer
I believe, You are all I need
Oh yes you are, yes you are
 And I believe, Youre my Portion
Lord I believe, You're more than enough for me
Jesus You are all I need

More than enough for me
Jesus Youre all I need
Youre my Healer---Lyrics submitted by Meigan.
