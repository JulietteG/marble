Worthy is the, Lamb who was slain
Holy, Holy is he
Sing a new song, to Him who sits on
Heaven's mercy seat
(repeat twice)

Holy, Holy, Holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was, and is, and is to come
With all creation I sing
Praise to the King of Kings, you are my everything 
and I will adore you

Clothed in rainbows, of living colors
Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
Blessing, and honor, strength and glory
And power be
To you the only wise King

Holy, Holy, Holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was, and is, and is to come
With all creation I sing
Praise to the King of Kings, you are my everything 
and I will adore you

Filled with wonder, awe-struck wonder
At the mention of your name
Jesus your name is power
breath, and living water
such a marvelous mystery

Holy, Holy, Holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was, and is, and is to come
With all creation I sing
Praise to the King of Kings, you are my everything 
and I will adore you---Lyrics submitted by Deven.
