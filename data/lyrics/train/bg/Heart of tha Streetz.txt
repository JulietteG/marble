It's like I'm the Heart Of Tha Street Knah'im'sayin
you already know a body can't operate without a heart Knah'im'sayin
so if the heart stop then the street stops bumpin

[Verse 1]
if you could catch me not strapped nigga you good
come out the house without the pistol I wish I would
haters would love to catch me slippin but nigga please
I know these streets to well they a part of me
I'm a fool I feel like I'm the best
I take ya old lady-get my name tatted on her chest
I leave the ass soaked, I leave the pussy wet
I give her back to you then move on to who next
I hold the block down green, white, and brown
cross Martin Luther King on Velle uptown
I live by the code, I die by the code
don't rat, don't snitch, don't bend, don't fold Let's go!

[Chorus]
When I was young man I got lost in the streets
but now my heart in the streetz-man I'm the heart of the streetz
When I was young man I got lost in the streets
but now my heart in the streetz-man I'm the heart of the streetz
When I was young man I got lost in the streets
but now my heart in the streetz-man I'm the heart of the streetz
When I was young man I got lost in the streets
but now my heart in the streetz-man I'm the heart of the streetz

[Verse 2]
All the hood niggaz feel me
and I ain't hard to find since I got money-the hood is where I still be
post up ciggerette hangin from my lip
glock in my pocket you see it I extended the clip
no joke-nigga no game
dogg it's all real with me it's no playin
I walk it how I talk it, I play it how it go
only three words I tell them people is "I-Don't-Know"
you say you 'bout this, you say you 'bout that
I heard nigga bust at you and you ain't bust back
you say you so this, you say you so that
I did an investigation nigga you ain't sold jack what's that?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Man I sleep with the tigers, I eat with the bears
however you want it believe that I can take it there
it's real in the field dogg, kill or be killed homes
pop or get popped up-walk or get walked on
steal or get stole dogg-pimp or get pimped nigga
shake or get shook dogg...flip or get flipped nigga
step or get stepped on pop or get popped up
watch what you say on the phone will get you locked up
shoot or get shot dogg, do or get done nigga
if you a man always stand and never run nigga
that's how I play it man Gizzle a G
if you ain't know (uh oh) man I'm the heart of the street

[Chorus]
