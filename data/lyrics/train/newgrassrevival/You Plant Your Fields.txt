My father said, some things you learn
By only doin' when it comes your turn
Everything comes around so be ready if you can
Prepare your heart like the farmer turns his land

And you plant your fields when the spring is tender
When the summer beats down, you pray for rain
You hope for the harvest and the long cold winter
And then you plant your fields again

Well he spoke right to my restless soul
Still wild and hungry and beyond control
For all that you dream there's a time and a place
But you won't know it till it comes your way

And you plant your fields when the spring is tender
When the summer beats down, you pray for rain
You hope for the harvest and the long cold winter
And then you plant your fields again

When the spring is tender
When the summer beats down, you pray for rain
You hope for the harvest and the long cold winter
And then you plant your fields again

You plant your fields again
You plant your fields again
You plant your fields again
You plant your fields again---Lyrics submitted by RONNIE DAVID.
