Time, time (x2)

Theres no time time time for sleeping sleeping
Were going out out out no sleeping sleeping tonight
(repeat)

Im feeling naughty, Im feeling good, Im feeling pretty,
And got no plans and got no job and got no meaning
But I get my friends and all the time, and I want to party
And all the people follow me, you know I got it

Theres no time, for sleeping tonight (x2)

Refrain:
Theres no time time time for sleeping sleeping
Were going out out out no sleeping sleeping tonight
(repeat)

I party like a Rockstar (star), partyin loud on the top of a car
They say Im bizarre (aha), but the love the way I are (are)
Ill dont roll a jar, y'all going no where from
Workaholic, yes sir! (hahaha, Productious)

Fresh on the move, ready for whatever, till I reach my tune
 lets get loud, from E-E-Egypt to Cancun now
... wow, cause these girls are going: wow
oh la la its true, yeah, know how we do.

Theres no time, for sleeping tonight (x2)

Refrain:
Theres no time time time for sleeping sleeping
Were going out out out no sleeping sleeping tonight
