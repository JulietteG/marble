My computer thinks I'm gay 
I threw that piece of junk 
away on the Champs-Elysees 
as I was walking home. 

this is m last communique 
down the supper highway all 
that I have left to say in 
a single tome. 

I got too many friends too 
many people that I'll never 
meet and I'll never be there 
for I'll never be there for 
cause I'll never be there. 

If I could give it all away 
will it come back to me 
someday like a needle in the 
hay or an expensive stone. 

But I got a reason to declaim 
the applications are to blame 
for all my sorrow an my pain 
a feeling so alone. 

I got too many friends too 
many people that I'll never 
meet and I'll never be there 
for I'll never be there for 
cause I'll never be there. 

My computer thinks I'm gay 
I threw that piece of junk 
away on the Champs-Elysees 
as I was walking home. 

I got too many friends too 
many people that I'll never 
meet and I'll never be there 
for I'll never be there for 
cause I'll never be there---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
