I was alone, falling free,trying my best not to forget.
     What happened to us, what happened to me,
     What happened as I let it slip.
     I was confused by the power that be,
     Fogetting names and faces.
     Passers-by were looking at me,
     As if  they could erase it.

      Baby did you forget to take your meds?
      Baby did you forget to take your meds?

     I was alone, staring over the ledge,trying my best not to forget
    All manner of joy, all the manner of glee
    And our one heroic pledge.
    How it mattered to us,how it mattered to me,
    And  the consequences.
    I was confused by the birds and bees , fogetting if I meant it.


     Baby, did you forget to take your meds? 
     Baby, did you forget to take your meds?
     Baby, did you forget to take your meds?

    And the sex and the drugs and the complications ....(4)

    Baby,did you forget to take your meds?)6)

    I was alone, falling free,trying my best not to forget.---Lyrics submitted by Natalia.
