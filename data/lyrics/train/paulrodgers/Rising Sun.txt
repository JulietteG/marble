"Rising Sun"


In the land of the rising sun
The story and the glory of our life
Began


In the city of the east
The yearning and the burning of our love
was believed.


With a love this strong
No mountain is too high to climb 
With a love this strong
No mountain is too high to climb 


With a love this strong
No mountain is too high to climb 
With a love this strong
No mountain is too high to climb 


No mountain
No mountain is too high to climb---Lyrics submitted by Omid Ghahreman.
