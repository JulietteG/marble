Well I could feel a hot one,
Taking me down,
For a moment I could feel the force,
Veiny to the point of tears,
And you were holding on to make a point,
What's the point?

I am but a clean man,
Stable and alone man,
Make it so I wont have to try.
The faces always stay the same,
So I'll face the fact that I'm just fine,
I said that I'm just fine.

Well I remember head down,
After you'd found out,
Manna is a hell of a drug,
I need a little more I think,
Because enough is never quite enough,
What's enough?

I took it like a grown man,
Crying on the pavement,
Hoping you would show your face,
I haven't heard a thing you've said,
In at least a couple hundred days,
What'd you say?

I was in the front seat,
Shaking it out,
And I was asking if you felt alright,
I never wanna hear the truth,
I wanna hear your voice,
it's sounding fine,
My voice, it's sounding fine.

I could feel my heart beat,
taking me down,
And for the moment I would sleep alright,
Veiny with a selfish fear,
to keep me up another restless night,
Another restless night.

The blood was dry,
It was sober,
The feeling of audible cracks,
And I could tell it was over,
From the curtains that hung from your neck.

And I realized that then you were perfect,
With my teeth ripping out of my head,
And it looked like a painting I once knew,
Back when my thoughts weren't entirely intact.

So I prayed for what I thought were angels,
Ended up being ambulances,
The Lord showed me dreams of my daughter,
She was crying inside your stomach,
And I felt love, again---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
