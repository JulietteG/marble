Dirty on the ground is what I need
I got another one to tell you and another one to make you believe

Pity on the grass; I tried to be the one you needed
When I told you that you wanted something bigger than me

I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want and I know they don't want me to stay

'cause you and I will ride
But when I need you
I need it quickly
In case you never know

I can't play where I'm not supposed to anyway
Any way, Anyways, Any way, Anyways...

Dirty on the ground is what I see
I need another reason why I need another reason
Tell me to breath

The dirtier the sound the better I breath
I tried to do it all for you
It didn't do anything for me

I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want and I know they don't want me to stay

And you and I will find
That when I need you
I need it quickly
In fact you'll never know

I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want and I know they don't want me to stay---Lyrics submitted by Jeffrey.
