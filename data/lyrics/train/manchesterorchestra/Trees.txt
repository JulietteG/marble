I used to feel some guilt
Now I just feel empty
I wasn't supposed to bend
Least not this quickly

I wanted to walk
Oh you, you wanted to run
I wanted to talk
Oh you, you wanted to slide

I want to believe
I've got to believe

I used to feel some thrill
Now I just feel thrifty
I tried to clear my pain
I just made it empty

I wanted to walk
Oh you, you wanted to run
I wanted to talk
Oh you, you wanted to slide

I want to believe
I've got to believe

So I wanted to walk
Oh you, you wanted to run
I wanted to talk
Oh you, you wanted to slide ---
