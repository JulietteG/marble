i am the only one
that thinks im going crazy
and i dont know what to do

and i am the only son 
of a pastor and i know
he loves the things i do

but if it was you
i dont think that it would matter
oh and if it was true
then i just wouldnt matter

i was amazed at the color and shapes
that you do, a paper part for two
and i am the only son of a bastard
and i know you know the bastard too

because it was you
i called it a different story
but if i were you
i'd make this a simple story

i'll bet you did
what you did
when you did it
you'd do it again
by the time you were done with it

i'll bet you did
what you did
when you did
just to tell every friend that you have 
that the lord did it

i finally knew
that i simply couldn't matter
you finally knew
that you simply couldn't matter

i guess that's true
you know who knew
thepassive power
of the truth
would let me loose

if i could write
another phrase
you might be better off this way
but there's no use
honey there's no use---Lyrics submitted by marheena.
