Shake it out.
God I need another and another and another and another
I could feel it now
how i felt the Lord in my fathers house

I can see
I can see standing
we were seventeen
make it clean

Are you the living ghost of all i need
are you going to get the best of me

cause im done being done with a
funeral at least for now
are you tired of being alone
are you tired of being alone

shake it out
tired of another and another
wasnt really what i wanted
so we bled it out over the floor
of my neighbors house

i could see
God ive never seen a thing so complete
i am the living ghost of what you need
i am everything eternally
God. just speak

cause im done being done with a funeral
at least for now
are you tired of being alone
are you tired of being alone

so speak to me

oh God you got to shake it out
you got to take it out take it out
ive got to come around
i need it now more than i ever have

i felt the Lord begin
to peel off all my skin
and i felt the weight within
reveal a bigger mess
that you cant fix

i swear i swear ill go
lead me to my home
dont stop dont ever go
i swear youll never know
youll never know

oh God you got to shake it out shake it out
youve got to break it out break it down---Lyrics submitted by zoe.
