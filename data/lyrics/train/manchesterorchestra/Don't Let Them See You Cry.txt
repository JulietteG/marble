Don't let them see you cry
when tha damn breaks down 
and the city is covered in water
because i believe we fly
and the men takes shape 
and i doze off on your shoulders
and i trust that you see it too

o o o o o
o o o o o 

so breath while your alive
let the big band play as you tap at the weight of you fingers
and you try to write in style
but the word just come and write as soon as you see them
and i trust that you write them too

o o o o o 
o o o o o

and i trust that you love me too---Lyrics submitted by Tera.
