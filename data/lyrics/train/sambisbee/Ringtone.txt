This is your ringtone,
Pick up your cell phone,
Talk to me, I know you see
Me on your caller 
ID, Don't send me to voice mail,
I'll just call right back, yeah
Over and over
This is your ringtone
Pick up your cell phone
And talk to me...

The speed of physical attraction 
Satisfaction, chemical reaction
Let's give the neighbors something to shout about
I'm running down the hall
Waiting for your call
I know your all alone
This is your ringtone
Pick up your cell phone 
And talk to me...

Go out, come on and party
I've just got to get started
You know you feel something
I feel it too
Waiting on the street for you 

This is your ringtone,
Pick up your cell phone,
Talk to me, I know you see
Me on your caller 
ID, Don't send me to voice mail,
I'll just call right back, yeah
Over and over
This is your ringtone
Pick up your cell phone
And talk to me...---Lyrics submitted by Janine.
