Walks in the rain and talks in the dark
Old black and white movies, A day at the park
On a blanket on the ground, On a Sunday afternoon
Hanging with friends or off by ourselves
Drivin a-round yard sale to yard sale
Droppin by the county fair, winnin you a bear, poppin balloons

Chorus
If youre lookin for someone to do that with
Here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Dont look any farther than in my eyes
If youre looking for that man
Here I am

December nights all cuddled up
Warm by the fire and sharing a cup of hot cocoa
Laughing at old photos

Spanish guitars, sand and the sea, a quiet little table, just you and me
Sipping margaritas in a little cantina in ole Mexico

Chorus
If you are looking for someone to do that with
Here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Dont look any farther than in my eyes
If youre looking for that man
Here I am

Talking about life and talking about babies
Talking about us still in love when were eighty

Chorus
If you are looking for someone to do that with
Here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Dont look any farther than in my eyes
If youre looking for that man
Here I am

Here I am 
Baby, here I am---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
