I wasn't born for diggin deep holes 
I'm not made for pavin long roads 
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles 
But I'm pretty good at drinkin beer 

I'm not the type to work in a bank 
I'm no good at slappin on pant 
don't have a knack for makin motors crank, no 
But I'm pretty good at drinkin beer 

So hand me one more 
that's what I'm here for 
I'm built for having a ball 
I love the nightlife 
I love my budlight 
I like 'em cold and tall 

I ain't much for mowin thick grass

I'm too slow for workin' too fast 
I don't do windows so honey don't ask 
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer 

A go getter maybe I'm not 
I'm not known for doin' a lot 
But I do my best work when the weather's hot 
I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer 

So hand me one more 
that's what I'm here for 
I'm built for having a ball 
I love the nightlife 
I love my budlight 
I like 'em cold and tall 

I wasn't born for diggin deep holes 
I'm not made for pavin long roads 
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles 
But I'm pretty good at drinkin beer 
I'm pretty good at drinkin beer 

[Spoken] o hand me one more boys... 
that's what I'm here for---Lyrics submitted by Rob.
