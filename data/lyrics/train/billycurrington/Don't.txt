Don't you hate hearing that clock on the wall chiming
Saying it's time and don't you just wish we could stay right here together all day
No it wouldn't be a crime
If we crawled back in the bed got as close as we could get
Tried to figure out where this thing is going

Baby baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
Now I just can't believe it this feeling it just keeps getting stronger

If you gotta go 
You gotta know I might go crazy
Here without you baby
We're living every kiss
You ain't leaving me like this
It just ain't right
Waiting on till tonight
To light another flame 
You know it wouldn't be the same as the fire we got buring this morning

Baby baby don't
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
Now I just can't believe it this feeling it just keeps getting stronger

Love no one else could love me like you do
You know I aint even close to through
Loving you

Baby baby don't 
Don't just say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on
Now I just can't believe it thie feeling it just keeps getting stronger

Don't Baby baby don't
No baby don't
Ohhhh baby don't 
Baby baby dont---Lyrics submitted by kaitlyn.
