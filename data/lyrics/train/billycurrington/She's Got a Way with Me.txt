it's her gentle touch 
more than enough 
she can stop this whole world 
from spinning to much 
it's a natural thing 
and i do believe 
i found my reason to be 
she's got a way with me 
she's got a way with me 
I'm not the same man 
since she's been around 
theres more to this life 
i suddenly find 
i look at myself now 
so differently 
it's her love that brings me peace 
she's got a way with me 
she's got a way with me 
whatever it is 
I'll always be under her spell 
she'll always be 
all I'll ever need 
i could search this whole world 
I know I'll never find 
someone as perfect as her for me 
suddenly its something 
you just can't live without 
oh you know you found love 
beyond any doubt 
with a simple mans words 
i could never convey 
all that i feel when i say 
she's got a way with me 
she's got a way 
she's got a way with me 
she's got a way with 
she's got a way with me 
mmmm 
she's got a way with me---Lyrics submitted by Timothy.
