Met her at the Mercado 
She was buying avacados 
Man... she really turned me on 


She reached for my pepper 
I grabbed her tomatoes 
And I knew, it wouldnt be very long 


She walked to the mesa 
I grabbed my cerveza 
I got the onions and lemon

And the way she looked at me 
Man I could clearly see 
It wouldnt be very long 


Guacamole! GUACAMOLE! 
Guacamole! GUACAMOLE! 
Wed me making Guacamole all night long 


Guacamole! GUACAMOLE! 
Guacamole! GUACAMOLE! 
Wed be making Guacamole all night long 


She headed for the light 
I fell in right behind 
Man... She sure looked good to me 


She reached for her money 
I said "wait a minute honey 
I believe, this one is on me" 


So we got in my pickup 
We started to back up 
And headed on down the road 

 We went to her casa 
Tortillas de masa 
And made guacamole all night long 


Guacamole! GUACAMOLE! 
Guacamole! GUACAMOLE! 
Wed be making guacamole all night long 


Guacamole! GUACAMOLE! 
Guacamole! GUACAMOLE! 
Wed be making guacamole all night long---Lyrics submitted by NELLY.
