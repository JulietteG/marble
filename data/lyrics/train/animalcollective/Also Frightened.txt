Face your money into the dark
But you can't sweat unless
Swung by the hen
Let them crawl into the logs
That damn crouching for you
Offer a pen
Exciting and screaming
Their voices go wild
And rise with the birds
Mating up in the clouds
Two bottles at three covered
By leaves, maybe they will
Make prince on their backs

Will it just be like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?
Will it just be like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?

If they're awake till the dawn
We won't fret they don't have our eyes
Ghosting, crawling around but I
Won't be slept on our side
From our window to lanterns
Go signs on the night
And letters and shadows
Go watch with the light
I want to be who they will be
To be more like their dad

Will it just be like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?
Will it just be like they're dreaming?
Will it be just like I'm dreaming?

If the wind is threatenin'
Maybe I should bath them
Maybe we should let them
And I have a question:
Are yuo also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?
Are you also frightened?

No one should call you a dreamer
No one should call you a dreamer
No one should call you a dreamer---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
