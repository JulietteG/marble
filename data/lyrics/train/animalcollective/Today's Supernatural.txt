Come on, let go, erratic seesaw
This exploding in your brain is gonna throw me out again
And now I don't feel the same
Come on, let go, bionic hee haw
You can trust yourself with dance, you can wear your body chains
And I will welcome you the same
Come on, let go, it's not a question for your head
Come and join me near the speaker, there's a movie in your eye
And we don't have to be the same

'Cause your home's the sweetest thing inside of you
And our home is bigger than a mountain view
You'll find something you believe that you should do
Sometimes it won't come so easy but sometimes you've gotta go get mad

Come on, let go, the shifting easel
Well it's been dripping and now it's stained in the reds and the pinks
And now it don't look the same
Come on, let go out of the question for the dead
I made a shadow with my hand, I made it like your heart
But they will never be the same

'Cause your home's the sweetest thing inside of you
And our home is bigger than a mountain view
You find something you believe that you should do
Sometimes it won't come so easy but sometimes you've gotta go get mad

But all the good things like having your sons wake
All the good things like friends from a long way
They'll be some bad cakes, no seed comes for nothing
And then we watch them trail, feels like the sun's going down
But have you seen the clouds? Met you in Baltimore laughing so loud
But have you seen those clouds? You should come on out
Today feels so supernatural

Come on, let go, erratic seesaws
This exploding in your brain is gonna throw me out again
And now I don't feel the same
Come on, let go out of the question for the dead
I made a shadow with my hand, I made it like your heart
But they will never be the same---
