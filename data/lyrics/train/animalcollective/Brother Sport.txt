Open up your, open up your
Open up your throat
And let the all of that time
All of that time, all of that time go

I know it sucks that daddy's dumb
But try to think of what you want
You got to open up your
Open up your, open up your
Open up your throat
Matt

Open up your (Open up your)(7x)
Open up your throat

Open up your, open up your
Open up your throat
And let the all of that time
All of that time, all of that time go

I know it sucks that daddy's dumb
But try to think of what you want
You got to open up your
Open up your, open up your throat
Matt

Support your brother (sports brother) (7x)
Support your brother

You got to weigh what he said
To help you shape the way you play
You gotta get rid of the mourning
Sort out the habits of your mind
(3x)

Until fully grown
You got a real good shot
Won't help to hold inside
Keep it real keep it real shout out---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
