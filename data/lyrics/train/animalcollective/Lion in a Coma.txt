When all this mess will get me down I will depart from Chinatown
Weaving in and out of line, the sidewalk's full of merchandise
My nervous tick has got to quit, my cheeks are chewed down to the bit
Up on the roof they're still around the hustling crowds still reach down
I go up there and light a leaf and wish our turn was not so brief
I'm paler than a summer blouse that's packed inside a haunted house
I pack my bags and feel the family here is cropped by many hands
That dig and plant me for the spring, come dig me out my lucid brain

this wilderness up in my head,
this rhythm that's up in my head,
this rhythm it needs to get right out of my clothes and get into my bedroom.

Is there no reason it can't be the way it was, music and me?
My three best friends so casually just letting go so joyfully
But if I let my wrist get tired, but if I let my spirit cry out
There'll always be that fear of dying or is it just trying to divide?
It makes me think my dearest things are not what they're supposed to be
I trick myself when it is hard, I've got to keep up, oh my god
And hope that I will not be wrong and keep my faith inside a song
And we'll make up 'morrow, which reminds me not to leave them back inside

this rhythm that's up in my head,
this wilderness up in my head,
this rhythm it needs to get right out of my clothes and get into my bedroom.

lion in a coma, lion in a coma
lion in a coma, lion in a coma

sometimes the sun will shine, yes I am just doin fine.
sometimes i'm not aware where I am or what I care
sometimes i'm well-to-do but I don't know what to do
sometimes I don't agree with my thoughts on being free

please don't leave me
things that feel good,
I've been lucky
trying to feel good

sometimes the sun will shine, yes I am just doin' fine.
sometimes i'm not aware where I am or what i care
sometimes i'm well-to-do but I don't know what to do
sometimes i don't agree with my thoughts on being free.

please don't leave me
things that feel good,
I've been lucky
trying to feel good

lion in a coma, lion in a coma
who wants to smell the fine aroma,
lion in a coma, lion in a coma
who wants to run but cannot roam
a lion in a coma, lion in a coma
who wants to use his aching bones
a lion in a coma, lion in a coma
don't keep a lion in a coma

lion in a coma, lion in a coma
who wants to smell the fine aroma,
lion in a coma, lion in a coma
who wants to use his aching bones
a lion in a coma, lion in a coma
who wants to run but cannot roam
a lion in a coma, lion in a coma
don't keep a lion in a coma---Lyrics submitted by Jacob.
