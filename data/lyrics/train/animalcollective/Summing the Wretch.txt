Watch it watch you watching wretch
Plugged into a people patch
Watch as bonds that illustrate
Also start to complicate

Catches in a net of type
Absence makes the sense go dark
All of the intended dart
None of the extended soul

Getting screwed not much to do
When no ones watching
No ones looking
Can you see it

Feel a surge and make a steal
No one round to see the deed
Surge so strong its tough to tame
Urges lead with none to blame

Things go up that must come down
Those so down dont want to drop
Every one so keen to glow
Bubble up from down below

Wicked moves with none to lose
When no ones looking
No ones watching
Can you be it

So
Dont get caught lost

So
Dont get caught watching
Dont get caught lost
Dont get caught watching
Dont get caught lost---
