Feels like, I just, Touched the sky
Fire, Burning, Burning High
Feel the, fire, day and night
Let's Party!!

Party on my level (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
Party on my level (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
Party on my level (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
Party on my level

It's suicide to be this fucked up
Ask the bartender for one more cup
Keep it hard, get real tough
And party like you can't get enough

Don't really wanna hurt nobody
But i can't help but be naughty
I'm gonna wild out wild out
While i'm up here in this party

Feels like, I just, Touched the sky
Fire, Burning, Burning High
Feel the, fire, day and night
Let's Party!!

Party on my level (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
Party on my level (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
Party on my level (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
Party on my level

Ponte loca, vamos a gozar
We gon' party like we fucking stars
Leave the planet, land on mars
Gonna stay fucked up, till morning comes

Don't really wanna hurt nobody
But i cant help but be naughty
I'm gonna wild out wild out
While i'm up here in this party

Party on my level
Party on my level
Party on my level
Party on my level

Party on my level (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
Party on my level (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
Party on my level (Ohh Ohh Ohh)
Party on my level---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
