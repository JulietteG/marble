Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why 
But lately you don't talk to me
And darling I can't see me in your eyes

I hold you near, but you're so far away
but let your love flow back to me
how can you leave and let this feeling die
(You alone)You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow (tomorrow) if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
(Only my love)Only my love can raise you high above it all

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love.
Don't throw it all away, our love.
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love.
Don't throw it all away, our love. 

We can take the darkness and make it full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die? 
(Happy room) This happy room would be a lonely place when you are gone
(And I)And I won't even have your shoulder for the crying on
(No other love) no other woman's love could be as true
I'm begging you

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

We changed the world we made
it ours to hold but dreams are made for those who really
try This losing you is real but I still feel you here
inside 

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love(x6)---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
