Ive watched her close her eyes
When she kissed me
And Ive heard her moan so low
And Ive felt her hold me tight
With all her soul inside
In ways a woman only knows

CHORUS 

You wont see one like her
In this whole world
Shes given me some memories
A lifetimes worth
If she didnt love me
You can take my word
She put on the greatest show on earth 

Lookin back I cant believe
I couldnt see she needed me
But like a fool I let it end
And it should have been so clear
When I wiped away those tears
Theres just some things you cant pretend 

CHORUS 

Maybe I just saved myself
The pain and all the heartache
Of bein just another face in the crowd
She made it look so real Lord
It came to her so easy
Its one thing that Ill never doubt 

CHORUS

You wont see one like her
In this whole world
Shes given me some memories
A lifetimes worth
If she didnt love me
You can take my word
She put on the greatest show on earth---Lyrics submitted by Tanya Cramer.
