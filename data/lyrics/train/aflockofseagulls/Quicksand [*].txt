I'm walking over quicksand
Stop talking holding my hand
I'm circling to a new low
Shout loud and let the world know

I'm sailing on the jet-stream
Like walking through an old dream

Have you ever been down
You should take a look at my life
I've been living in the city
I could let you look a my miles

Have you every been down
Ya well take a look at my life
Have you ever been down
Just take a look at my life---Lyrics submitted by Rob.
