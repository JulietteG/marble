You, you, you, meet me, me, me
At this station, station
Can't, can't, can't, get used, used, used
To patience, patience
Wish time, this time
Could just be a bit shortened, shortened
Be-be-be-be-tween u-u-us
Six million seasons

Gotta run, gotta run, gotta run
And make it or die

8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done without you
I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you

F-F-Feels like we-we-we'll be frozen, frozen
N-N-Need you to-to tell me "Je t'aime", "Je t'aime"
Full speed cause we gotta look to discover, cover
G-G-Get me j-j-just a little closer

Gotta run, gotta run, gotta run
And make it or die

8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done without you
I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you

I'm gonna come, just meet me there
Gonna come straight away
It all starts with we
Gonna find you in the night
Gonna make it or die
Gonna come straight away
It all starts with we
Gonna find you
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you

I loved, I loved
Ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you
I loved, I loved, I fell, I fell
Ran away, ran away, ran away, ran away
Gotta say, gotta say, gotta say, gotta say
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming for you---
