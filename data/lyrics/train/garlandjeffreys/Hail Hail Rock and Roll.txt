Pockets of hate
Rockets of love
It's never too late 
For change in the color of
The color of her
The color of him
It really does matter
What skin you're in
Big yellow taxi cab passed me by
Stop on the next corner to pick up a white guy
The color of you
The coloe of me
You can't judge a man
By looking at the marquee

Hail Hail rock 'n' roll
Comes from R & B and soul
Don't leave me standing in the cold
Used to think I'd never grow old
Hail Hail rock 'n' roll
Don't leave me standing on the beat
Leave me stranded on the street
I see the light, I fell the heat

Blame it on you
Blame it on me
Now let's erase the wound
That's in our history
Pain in my heart
Won't let me be
Take it from me
But don't you take away my liberty
Father of coal, Mother of pearl
Never too black to blush to pick up a white girl
The color of you
The color of me
You can't judge a man
By looking at the marquee

Hail Hail rock 'n' roll
Comes from R & B and soul....

Little Richard
Chuck Berry
Bo Diddley
Fats Domino
Here comes Elvis
Gene Vincent
Buddy Holly
And Jerry Lee

Hail Hail rock 'n' roll
Comes from R & B and soul....---Lyrics submitted by Bluebird.
