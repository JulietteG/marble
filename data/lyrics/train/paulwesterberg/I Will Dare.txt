How young are you?  How old am I?
Let's count the rings, around my eyes.
How smart are you?  How dumb am I?
Don't count any of my advice.

Meet me any place, or anywhere, at any time;
Now I don't care, meet me tonight,
If you will dare, I might dare.

Call me on a Thursday, if you will;
Call me on Wednesday, better still.
Ain't lost yet so I gotta be a winner,
Fingernails and cigarettes, a lousy dinner.
How young are you? Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

Come on!  Meet me any place, or anywhere, at any time;
Now I don't care, meet me tonight,
If you will dare, I will dare.

Meet me any place, or any where, at any time,
Now, I don't care, meet me tonight,
If you will dare, I will dare.

How young are you?  How old am I?
Let's count the rings, around my eyes.

How smart are you?  How smart are you?
How dumb am I?  Dumb am I.

Meet me any place, or anywhere, at any time,
Now I don't care, meet me tonight,
If you would dare, I will dare.

Meet me any place, or anywhere, at any time,
Now I don't care, meet me tonight,
If you will dare, I will dare.---Lyrics submitted by Stephany Wagner.
