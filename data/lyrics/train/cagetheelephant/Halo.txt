Every time I get away you
find a way to reel me back in. (aah)
Tell me that you love me
hold me tight so we can always be friends. (aah)
I swear
I've said it before, and I say it again! (aah)
Every time I get away you
find a way to pull me back in. (aah)

Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?
Why does it take so lo-oo-ong?

Knew I, couldn't help myself
I had to lay low.
So I, couldn't help myself
I lost my halo.

Take me by the hand and
still remember all the good times we had. (aah)
I remember how you took my favourite knife
and sticked under my skin. (aah)
I swear
I've said it before, and I say it again! (aah)
Every time I get away you
find a way back under my skin.

Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?

Knew I, couldn't help myself
I had to lay low.
So I, couldn't help myself
I lost my halo.

All my life
With a skeleton.
I had to let go.

So I, couldn't help myself
I lost my halo.
I lost my halo
I lost my halo---
