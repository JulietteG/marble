Time shakes, found you at the water
At first you were my father, now I love you like a brother
Earthquakes shake the dust behind you
This world at times will blind you
Still I know I'll see you there

Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you would see here
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming
Come a little closer, then you'll see

Heartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders
Will we burn or we just smolder
Somehow I know I'll find you there
Oooh, I wanna see if you can change it, change it
Still I know I'll see you there

Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you would see here
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see

Ten thousand people stand alone now
And in the evening the sun sets
Tomorrow it will rise
Time flies by, they all sang along
Time flies by, they all sang along
Time flies by, they all sang along
Time flies - bye, bye

Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see ---
