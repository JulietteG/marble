Electrified harmonious
I think I'll take it out to the streets
Somebody please stop me
Call the doctor but don't call the police

Are you into the beat?
Are you into the beat?
I can feel it in my teeth

I can feel it in my teeth
I can feel it in my teeth
And it's driving me mad
I can feel it in my teeth
I can feel it in my teeth and it's driving me crazy
It's driving me crazy, it's driving me mad

I wish I were an astronaut
Space case planting the seed
They put me in a hospital
Locked me up and threw away the key

Hey, hey, hey, hey, are you into the beat?
I'm the king of the beat
I can feel it in my teeth

I can feel it in my teeth
I can feel it in my teeth
And it's driving me mad
I can feel it in my teeth
I can feel it in my teeth and it's driving me crazy
It's driving me crazy, it's driving me mad---
