Fall into that black hole honey
Looking up from your eyes
Everything that you ever wanted
You fight, but why?

Fold it up just like a piece of paper
Take your sweet little time
You can can write it on the sidewalk yeah
but you'll find, it's not right

And now you're walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I got to believe
Someday you'll see
Someday you'll see that there's something more
Yeah that's why you're so bored
Oh there's something more

And now he's standing at your door
Nowhere better to be
But I can see you tie your own shoelaces
You bleed


Fall in love just like a newborn baby
Blond hair and blue eyes
Taking pictures with your polaroid
You'll find, it's all right

And now you're walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I got to believe
Someday you'll see
Someday you'll see that there's something more
Yeah that's why you're so bored
Oh there's something more

And now you're walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I got to believe
Someday you'll see
Someday you'll see that there's something more
Yeah that's why you're so bored
Oh there's something more---Lyrics submitted by Biskit.
