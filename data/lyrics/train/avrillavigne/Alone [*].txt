Uh uh oh oh oh
Uh uh oh oh oh
Hey man,
Tel me what were u thinking
What  the hell were you saying?
Oh come on now
Stop and think about it.
Hey now,
maybe you should just listen,
maybe you should stop talking for
a second.
Shut up,listen to me.
                                           (CHORUS)
                               You`re so obvious.
                       youre so oblivious.
              and now you wonder why,
                                     your the one alone.
                                   So don`t` apologize,
                     you dont even realize.
                    you screwed it up this time
             now your the one alone
                                    Uh uh oh oh oh
                                    Uh uh oh oh oh
  Hey bro,
I`m just trying to let you know,
you really think that your special,
Oh come on now.
I`ve seen so much better.
hey there,
did you really think that I cared?
Don`t know if you want to go there
Oh come on now.
Keep on,keep on dreaming.
(Chorus)
If you.
Want to.
Be my.
Uh uh oh,
You know.
you can`t play games.
And you know what I mean.
Sorry.
But you dont.
Get my.
my-y-y-y.
I`m gone.
Yourr still dreaming.
About me.
over and over and over and over 
and over again.
                              (Chorus)
                              (Chorus)

uh uh oh oh oh
Uh uh oh oh oh
Uh uh oh oh oh
Uh uh oh oh oh
