darlin
your hiding in the closet once again
start smiling
i know your trying
real hard not to turn your head away
pretty darlin
face tomorrow
tomorrows not yesterday

yes today

pretty please
i know its a drag
wipe your eyes
and put your head
i wish you could be
happy instead
theres nothing else i can do
but love you the best that i can

yeah yeah yeah yeah

once awhile ago
i know
that its 
hard to be stuck with

when nobody trusts

and put your head
i wish you could be
happy instead
theres nothing else i can do

your fault, your fault
its not your fault, your fault, your fault, your fault

i know its a drag
wipe your eyes
and put your head
i wish you could be
happy instead
theres nothing else i can do
but love you the best that i can

i know its a drag
wipe your eyes
and put your head
i wish you could be
happy instead
theres nothing else i can do
but love you the best that i can
