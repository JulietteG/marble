if i show you, get to know you
if i hold you just for today
im not gonna wanna let go
im not gonna wanna go home
tell me you feel the same

'cause im for real
are you for real
i cant help myself 
its the way i feel
when you look me in the eyes
like you did last night
i cant stand to hear you say goodbye
but it feels so right
'cause it feels so right
just to have you standing by my side
so dont let me go
'cause you have my soul
and i just wanted you to know

i dont want to look back
'cause i know that we have
something the past could never change
and im stuck in the moment
and my heart is open
tell me that you feel the same

'cause im for real
are you for real
i cant help myself 
its the way i feel
when you look me in the eyes
like you did last night
i cant stand to hear you say goodbye
but it feels so right
'cause it feels so right
just to have you standing by my side
so dont let me go
'cause you have my soul
and i just wanted you to know

hold(hold)
me down(me down)

i cant stand to hear you say goodbye
but it feels so right
'cause it feels so right
just to have you standing by my side
so dont let me go
'cause you have my soul
and i just wanted you to know

(im for real)
'cause im for real
are you for real
i cant help myself 
(its the way i feel)
its the way i feel
when you look me in the eyes
like you did last night
i cant stand to hear you say goodbye
(but it feels so right)
but it feels so right
'cause it feels so right
just to have you standing by my side
(by my side)
so dont let me go
'cause you have my soul
and i just wanted you to know---Lyrics submitted by Lauren.
