Wake up in the morning with a head like what ya done?
This used to be the life but I don't need another one
You like cuttin up and carrying on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely  when you''re up getting down

So I'll play along when I hear  that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You better move when you're swayin round the room
Looks like magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin' - when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance - But my feet cant find the way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin' - No sir, no dancin today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn, with you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colours make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when youre the only thing I lose?

So I just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that youre mine
Just please understand, when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around Im sure you'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin' - when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance - But my feet cant find the way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin' - No sir, no dancin today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn, with you

You cant make me dance around
But your two-step make my chest pound
Just lay me down as you float away into the shimmer light---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
