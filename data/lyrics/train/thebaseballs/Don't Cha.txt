I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why wnenever I come around
He's all over you

And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (It's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be fucking me

Don't cha wish your boyfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your boyfriend was freak like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?
Don't cha wish your boyfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your boyfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?

Fight the feeling (fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (leave it alone)
'Cause if it ain't love, it just ain't enough
To leave a happy home

Let's keep it friendly (let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair (you have to play fair)
See, I don't care
But I know he ain't gon' wanna share

Don't cha wish your boyfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your boyfriend was freak like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?
Don't cha wish your boyfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your boyfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?

I know he loves you (I know he loves you)
I understand (I understand)
I'd probably be just as crazy about you
If you were my girlfriend

Maybe next lifetime (maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (Possibly)
Until then old friend
Your secret is safe with me

Don't cha wish your boyfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your boyfriend was freak like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?
Don't cha wish your boyfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your boyfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
