Have you heard the news today
I'm leaving town, I'm cashing out
This town's too small for me to stay
The time is now, I'm heading out

Baby, I still need ya, but if you sta, I'll leave ya
Cuz I gotta get away

And if I ever see ya
My heart is gonna bleed, but i will leave you anyway

My darling, baby, this is a warning
said that I'm leaving on Monday morning
You'll get no answer, no use in calling
because I'm leaving on Monday morning

This flower needs somewhere to go
No place to grow on these dusty roads
I got two tickets and a dream
8:15 I'll save you a seat

Baby, I still need ya, but if you sta, I'll leave ya
Cuz I gotta get away

And if I ever see ya
My heart is gonna bleed, but i will leave you anyway

My darling, baby, this is a warning
said that I'm leaving on Monday morning
You'll get no answer, no use in calling
because I'm leaving on Monday morning

On Monday morning, on Monday morning
You'll get no answer, no use in calling
because I'm leaving on Monday morning

Baby, I still need ya, but if you sta, I'll leave ya
Cuz I gotta get away

And if I ever see ya
My heart is gonna bleed, but i will leave you anyway

My darling, baby, this is a warning
said that I'm leaving on Monday morning
You'll get no answer, no use in calling
because I'm leaving on Monday morning

My darling, baby, this is a warning
said that I'm leaving on Monday morning
You'll get no answer, no use in calling
because I'm leaving on Monday morning

My darling, baby, this is a warning
said that I'm leaving on Monday morning
You'll get no answer, no use in calling
because I'm leaving on Monday morning---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
