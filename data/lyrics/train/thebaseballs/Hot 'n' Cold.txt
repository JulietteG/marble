You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch, I would know
And you over think, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold, you're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out, you're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right, it's black and it's white
We fight, we break up, we kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really stay, no (You) but you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold, you're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out, you're up then you're down

We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold, you're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out, you're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right, it's black and it's white
We fight, we break up, we kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really stay, no (You) but you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold, you're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out, you're up then you're down

Someone, call the doctor, got a case of love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster, can't get off this ride
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold, you're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out, you're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right, it's black and it's white
We fight, we break up, we kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really stay, no (You) but you don't really wanna go, oh
You're hot then you're cold, you're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out, you're up then you're down---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
