Hey I'm in love
My fingers keep on cliking - To the beating of my heart

Hey I can't stop my feet
Ebony and Ivory and dancing - In the street

Hey it's because of you 
The world is in a crazy hazy hue

My heart is beating like a jungle drum (3x)

Man you got me burnin'
I'm the moment between - The striking and the fire

Hey read my lips
'Cause all thay say is - Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss

No it won't ever stop
My hands are in the air - Yes I'm in love

My heart is beating like a jungle drum (4x)

And so on  buruburobummbummbumm---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
