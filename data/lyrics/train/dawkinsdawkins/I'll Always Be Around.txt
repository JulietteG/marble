Verse: 

When we were younger I looked up to You 
In more ways than You'll ever know 
If I ever needed some direction 
You never hesitated to show and that's why 

Hook: 

I'll always be around (Just as long as I'm alive I'll be right by Your side) 
I'll never let You down (Just know that) I'll be around 

Verse: 

Now that we're older I've gotta tell You something 
I wouldn't trade You for a thing 
Cause there ain't nothin' quite like family 
I've got You, You've got me and none can come between 

Hook (2X): 

I'II always be around (If you need anything at all, 
all you gotta do is call) 
I'll never let you down (And when you're feelin' down) 
I'll be around, yeah 
(I need you to know that) I'll always be around 
I'll never let you down (Every night and 
every day) 
I'll be around (For you on my knees I pray) 

Bridge: 

Rain or shine (I'll be there) 
Anytime (there's one thing) 
You should know, I need you 
(You can) Count on me 
(Cause I will) always be 
(Cause you're my) family I love you
