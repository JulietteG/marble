Take off your fucking mask
Let them see what you really are
Just beg until your lungs collapse
This was worthless from the start

Am I just wasting my time?
Waiting around as you ruin your life
Why won't you try and just put up a fight
I know theres something left inside your mind

Show me something real
Something that I can grasp
Show me I was real
Or feel my fucking wrath
How does it feel to know
You'll never feel again
So concerned with staying afloat
But you're as good as dead

Am I just wasting my time?
Waiting around as you ruin your life
Why won't you try and just put up a fight
I know theres something left inside your mind
Waiting around as you ruin your life
I know theres something left inside your mind

Keep thinking that your better than me
You wont be smiling once I rip out your fucking teeth
There is nothing better than getting to watch you bleed---Lyrics submitted by Lunar Fang.
