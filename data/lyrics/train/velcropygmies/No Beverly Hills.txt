Aint got my picture in no magazine
Dont ride around in no black limousine

Aint got no money to be spent on drugs
Dont sleep with women on no Persian rugs

Dont drive a car that goes so fast we get killed
And I dont have a house in Beverly Hills.

Aint got no records hanging on my wall
No secretaries to hold my calls

No crazy women sleeping in my yard
And I dont own a single credit card

Aint got a mountain size pile of bills
And I dont have a house in Beverly Hills

Aint got no phone, aint got no car
Cant get no credit at the local bar

Aint got a watch, no diamond ring
In fact I dont think I have anything

Aint got no phone, aint got no car
Cant get no credit at the local bar

Aint got a watch, no diamond ring
In fact I dont think I have anything

Aint got investments in no real estate
Aint got no money but it sure feels great

Dont owe no money to the government
I dont owe anyone a single cent

Aint got a mountain size pile of bills
And I dont have a house in Beverly Hills
No Beverly Hills..No Beverly Hills..No Beverly Hills---Lyrics submitted by Wendy Thompson.
