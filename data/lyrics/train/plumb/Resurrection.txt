Everything's gone black
I feel so cold
It's so dark here
Only you know how deep the darkness goes

You know it all
You've heard every thought
No matter what the heart break
Only you can make it beautiful

Oh I believe in resurrection
Everything that's dead will come alive
I believe in restoration
Better than before
Stronger and secure

Oh I believe in resurrection

All the lights come on
Everything is new
All the demons flee
Your promises are true

Oh I believe in resurrection
Everything that's dead will come alive
I believe in restoration
Better than before
Stronger and secure

Oh I believe in resurrection
Stones will roll away before my eyes
I believe in new creation
You make all things new
Nothing's impossible for you

Oh I believe in resurrection
I believe in resurrection

Oh do you believe in a God who holds the world in his hands
Oh do you believe that story we're living is not the end
This is not the end

I believe in resurrection
Everything that's dead will come alive
I believe in restoration
Better than before
Stronger and secure

Oh I believe in resurrection
Stones will roll away before my eyes
I believe in new creation
You make all things new
Nothing's impossible for you

I believe in resurrection
I believe in resurrection
I believe in resurrection---
