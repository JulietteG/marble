What is this mass confusion 
This crazy way we're living
This emptiness we're passing out
Like candy coated water drops
We're spilling out our thoughts
We're passing out your guts
But I can't help but stop think that ...

If the world woulds stop spinning
If the end was beginning
Would you even notice if I wasn't there
If the world would stop spinning around
All that's worth dying for is already dead
An empty religion we've learned to accept
And nothing means everything
The daily routine
We go through the motions 
A helpless machine

If the world would stop spinning
If the end is beginning
Would you even notice if I wasn't there
If the world would stop spinning around
Spin around, you spin around
I can't help wondering
You spin around, you spin around
But I can't help wondering

When the answers to everything are right in your hands
Lose your convictions you can't help standing
And the one thing that held you for so many years
You ask for forgiveness and hold back the tears
But I can't help but stop and think that ...

If the world would stop spinning 
If the end is beginning 
Would you even notice if I wasn't there
If the world would stop spinning around
If the world would stop spinning
If the end was beginning 
Would you even notice if i wasn't there
If the world would stop spinning around
Spin around, you spin around
But I can't help wondering
You spin around, you spin around
But I can't help wondering
But I can't help wondering
oooo yeah,  hey 
oooo yeah

He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got you and me and sister in His hands
He's got you and me and sister in His hands
He's got you and me and sister in His hands
He's got you and me and brother in His hands
He's got you and me and brother in His hands
He's got you and me and brother in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
...that's all I know...---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
