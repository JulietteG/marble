Though I walk through a valley
That feels worse than death
I am slow to speak instead
I hear Your voice
And it says come to Me
You the tired and heavy
And I will give you
Much-needed rest

You are my hope
You are my song
You are the oxygen inside these weary lungs
You are my safe place
You are my home
You are my shelter when it all goes up in smoke

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Though I have danced
With the devil and all of his friends
I am quick to see Your hands offered to me
Hands that bear my scars
And feet that pull me towards Him
I am humbled by Your love for me

You are my hope
You are my song
You are the oxygen inside these weary lungs
You are my safe place
You are my home
You are my shelter when it all goes up in smoke
You are my shelter when it all goes up in smoke

My healer
Provider
You are my God
Protector
My strength and shield
You are my God

You are my hope
You are my song
You are the oxygen inside these weary lungs
You are my safe place
You are my home
You are my shelter when it all goes up in smoke
You are my shelter when it all goes up in smoke
You are my shelter when it all goes up in smoke---
