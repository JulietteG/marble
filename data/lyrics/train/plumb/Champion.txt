You gave it all
In Your surrender
You held our name
Before the Father
To gain us back
You never faltered
You gave it all
You gave it all

You would not give up
You said it's not the end
Oh You did not hold back
You are our champion
The day that undid death
The day that rescue won
No You did not hold back
You are our champion

You were denied
So we could be Yours
You bled and died
Till we were paid for
It was Your life
That gave us our worth
You gave it all
You gave it all

You would not give up
You said it's not the end
Oh You did not hold back
You are our champion
The day that undid death
The day that rescue won
No You did not hold back
You are our champion

You fought for us
Our champion
You died for us
Our champion
You conquered hell
Our champion
Came back to life
Our champion, champion

You would not give up
You said it's not the end
Oh You did not hold back
You are our champion
The day that undid death
The day that rescue won
No You did not hold back
You are our champion

You fought for us
Our champion
You died for us
Our champion
You conquered hell
Our champion
Came back to life
Our champion, champion---
