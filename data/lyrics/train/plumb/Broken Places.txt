I trust You to heal
I trust You to save
So I'll trust You enough
To get out of the way
To come where I am
To silence my doubt
So I'll forfeit my plans
And let Yours play out

You are strong
In the broken places
I'm carried in Your arms
You are strong
In the broken places
There's healing in these scars

So I'll keep coming back
To what You said first
Beyond what I see
Beyond how it hurts
Whatever You ask God
No matter how hard
The place of my breaking is
Right where You are

You are strong
In the broken places
I'm carried in Your arms
You are strong
In the broken places
There's healing in these scars

You redeem You restore
You make things better than before
You reconcile You resurrect
You speak life over death

You are strong
In the broken places
I'm carried in Your arms
You are strong
In the broken places
There's healing in these scars---
