Your baby blues, so full of wonder
Your curly cues, your contagious smile 
And as I watch, you start to grow up
All i can do, is hold you tight

Knowing clouds will rage in
Storms will race in, but you will be safe in my arms
Rains will pour down, waves will crash around
But you will be safe in my arms

Story books are full of fairy tales
Of kings and queens and the bluest skies
My heart is torn just in knowing
You'll someday see the truth from lies

When the clouds will rage in
And the storms will race in but you will be safe in my arms
Rains will pour down, waves will crash around
But you will be safe in my arms

Castles they might crumble
Dreams may not come true
But you are never all alone
Because i will always, always love you
Hey I, hey I

When the clouds will rage in
Storms will race in but you will be safe in my arms
Rains will pour down, waves will crash around
But you will be safe in my arms, in my arms---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany.
