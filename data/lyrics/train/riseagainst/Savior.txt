It kills me not to know this but I've all but just forgotten 
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them 
As the telling signs of age rain down a single tear is dropping 
Through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten 
There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place 
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds 
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you 
Like walls that we just can't break through until we disappear 

So tell me now 
If this ain't love then how do we get out? 
Cause I don't know 
That's when she said I don't hate you boy 
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save 
That's when I told her I love you girl 
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have.

And the day pressed on like crushing weights 
For no man does it ever wait 
Like memories of dying days 
That deafen us like hurricanes 
Bathed in flames we held the brand 
Uncurled the fingers in your hand 
Pressed into the flesh like sand 
Now do you understand? 

So tell me now 
If this ain't love then how do we get out? 
Cause I don't know 
That's when she said I don't hate you boy 
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save 
That's when I told her I love you girl 
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have 

1000 miles away 
There's nothing left to say 
But so much left that I don't know 
We never had a choice 
This world is too much noise 
It takes me under 
It takes me under once again 
I don't hate you 
I don't hate you, no

So tell me now 
If this ain't love then how do we get out? 
Cause I don't know 
That's when she said I don't hate you boy 
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save 
That's when I told her I love you girl 
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have 

I don't hate you
I don't hate you
I don't hate you
I don't hate you, no
