so come test me
so come and break me
so come on intoxicate me
with hands tied behind my back
I fight and wait for you to strike
a new problem we can't stop them
we're outnumbered and un-cautioned
a rally cry ring out into the night

so pride yourself on what you are
and hold them all to words they can't take back
I've seen a place (it comes) to me in dreams
where fires die but light still shines for us to see

what did you have to say?
give me your logic, your definition
the words you twist to justify your position
of mass starvation and blind air strikes
every problem is solved with a fight
peace won't be found 'til we're underground
as long as we live without a sound

so pride yourself on what you are
and hold them all to words they can't take back
I've seen a place (it comes) to me in dreams
where fires die but light still shines for us to see

would God bless a murder of the innocents?
would God bless a war based on pride?
would God bless a money-hungry government?
no

would God bless our ineffective court system?
God bless the sweatshops we run.
God bless America
God bless America---Lyrics submitted by Logan.
