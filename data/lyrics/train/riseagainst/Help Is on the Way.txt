I have my mother's dreams
I have my father's eyes
You can't take that from me
Just go ahead and try

The crescent city sleeps
While giants in the sky
Preparing to unleash
Let loose a mighty cry

Can nobody save us
Will anyone try?
The bayou is burning
The cypress has died
And all along they're saying

"Help is on the Way", they said
They said, "Help is on the Way", they said
They said one by land two by sea
Right there in front of me
Help is on the Way

Five thousand feet below
As black smoke engulfs the sky
The ocean floor explodes
Eleven mothers cry

My bones all resonate
A burning lullaby
You can't take that from me
Just go ahead and try

She stands at the shoreline
With hands in the air
Here words pierce the dark night
"Does anyone care?"
And all along they're saying

"Help is on the Way", they said
They said, "Help is on the Way", they said
They said one by land two by sea
Right there in front of me
Help is on the Way

Right here, Right here
Choking on the black gold
Upon which we rely
We keep axes in the attic
To see cameras in the sky

Help is on the Way
They said Help is on the Way
We were told just to sit tight because
Somebody will soon arrive
Help is on the Way
But it never came.---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
