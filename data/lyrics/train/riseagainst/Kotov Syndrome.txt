There high on the watchtower
                           Keeping the peace,whatever that means
                                 'Cause you see the world through
                                  Cross hairs and TV's, dont you?

                                   Ten foot walls built around us
                              White picket death, so quiet, so safe
                 But if we fall, there will be nothing and no one to catch
                                     So sit back and watch as we

                                             Spin out of control
                                             Spin out of control
                              Try to recover but collide with each other 
                                             We spin out of control

                                       Something I cannot change
                            I was born in a place that lives by the sword
                                And thus to it's blade we're condemned
                           Don't you understand why we scream no more?

                                      My dreams are of children
                            Orphaned by blood spilled at these hands
                             And here on the graves of the innocent
                                            We raise our flag

                                          Spin out of control
                                          Spin out of control
                             Try to recover, but collide with each other 
                                     We spin out of control

                          Somethings you don't forgive, somethings you dont forget
                          Sometimes the fate you suffer is so much worse than death
                        We're way of course right now and we're drifting out to sea
                      So cut the anchor on your hear to be set free,set free, set free

                                          Spin out of control 
                                          Spin out of control

                                        Spin out of control 
                                        Spin out of control
                                 Try to recover,we have to recover
                              We fight or crash one after the other
                                          Spin out of control---Lyrics submitted by steff.
