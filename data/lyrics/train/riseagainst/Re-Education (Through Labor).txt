To the sound of a heartbeat pounding away
To the rhythm of the awful rusty machines
We toss and turn but don't sleep
Each breath we take makes us thieves
Like causes without rebels
Just talk but promise nothing else

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you

But we sow seeds to see us through
Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
We wait to reap what we are due

To the rhythm of a time-bomb ticking away
And the blair of the sirens combing the streets
Chased down like dogs we run from
Your grasp until the sun comes up

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you

But we sow seeds to see us through
Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
Look now at what they've done to you

White needles buried in the red
The engine roars, and then it gives
But never dies cause we don't live we just survive
On the scraps that you throw away

I won't crawl on my knees for you
I wont believe the lies that hide the truth
I won't sweat one more drop for you

Cause we are the rust upon your gears
We are the insect in your ears
We crawl, we crawl, we crawl all over you

But we sow seeds to see us through
Our days are precious and so few
We all reap what we are due

Under this sky no longer blue
We bring a dawn long overdue
We crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
All over you!---Lyrics submitted by Drew.
