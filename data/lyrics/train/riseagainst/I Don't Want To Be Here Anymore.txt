On pins and needles
We are waiting for the fall
We count the days
Scratching lines on the wall

Wait in the wings at someone's beck and call
No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
Somewhere this fate, I lost control

We backed down
We took no for answers
For too long
We felt those walls close around

I don't want to be here anymore
I don't want to be here anymore
I don't want to be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth stay for

Your paradise is something I've endured
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
I don't want to be here anymore

On hand and foot we answered every single call
And weathered every ay like passing storms
But when they break we will all be gone

Won't back down
Won't take no
For answers anymore
These walls close
We pace back and forth

I don't want to be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth stay for

Your paradise is something I've endured
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
I don't want to be here anymore

The point where we break gets closed everyday
But where do we go?
But where do we go?

I don't want to be here anymore
I don't want to be here anymore
I don't want to be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth stay for

Your paradise is something I've endured
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn
And I don't want to be here anymore

(We need a better way)
(We need to let go)
(We need a better way)
(We need to let go)

Anymore---
