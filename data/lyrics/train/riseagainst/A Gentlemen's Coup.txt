The pain
disorder
a cataclysmic dawn
we trusted
but something has gone wrong
we bought in, but woke to find it gone
impact in 5, 4, 3, 2,

Brace
for fallout
the radiation creeps
on cats feet
we scatter in the streets
she asks me
"do you think it's safe to breath?"
it doesn't look that way to me

We stormed the gates
and raised new flags
but it's just the same old story
we seized the throne 
subjugate
we should have burned it to the ground 
and some might say we've lost our way
but i believe we've not gone far enough

afraid
we cower
to interests not our own
the power
to free or to control
we let it slip through
our fingers to the floor
watch as the bodies wash ashore
nobody lives here anymore

we stormed the gates
and raised new flags
but it's just the same old story
we seized the throne
subjugate
we should have burned it to the ground
some might say we've lost our way
but i believe we've not gone far enough

how long will we fall for this (x9)

we stormed the gates
and raised new flags
but it's just the same old story
we seized the throne
subjugate 
we should have burned it to the ground
some might say we've lost our way
but i believe we've not gone far enough---Lyrics submitted by Roland.
