She got down on hands and knees, one ear against the ground
Holding her breath to hear something, but the dirt made not a sound tonight

Echoes of songs still lurk on distant foreign shores, where we
Danced just to please the gods that only ask for more, and so it goes
But still we give ourselves to this
We can't spend our lives waiting to live

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
But daylight
Isn't what she wants
The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip

The postcard says wish you were here
But I'd rather I was there, holding
On to the simple things before they disappear, that's what I meant
But that was then, and this is now
I'll make it up to you somehow

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
But daylight
Isn't what she wants
The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Though the cracks I slip

A destination
A fading smile
Another station
Another mile
Another day gone
I swore that i will
Be there before dawn
So be there i will

She got down on hands and knees, one ear against the ground,
Holding her breath to hear something, anything at all
The Dirt Whispered "Child I'm coming home"

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
But the daylight
Isn't what she wants
The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Though the cracks I slip
I slip
Through the cracks I slip
Through the cracks I slip
Through the cracks I slip
Through the cracks I slip---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.
