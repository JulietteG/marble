Flowers was in her hair, she don't care
Peach pink lips, yeah, everybody stares
You think you've seen her in a magazine
It's like she walked right out of your dreams

Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band
Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan
Yeah, she runs a place at Penny lane
Yeah you lucky if you're on her plane

From Tokyo, to Mexico, to Rio

That girls a trip, a one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause shes got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause shes got that one international smile

She's got that, je ne sais quoi, you know it
So tres chic, yeah, she's a classic
But she's pole dancing so fancy free
Yeah, she dances to a own beat
'Cause she's the muse and the artist
Always leaves a jealous stardust
'Cause she's a little bit a yolo, and she's a little bit a [?] "oh no"

From LA, Miami, to New York City

That girls a trip, a one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause shes got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause shes got that one international smile

Please fasten your seatbelts, and make sure your champagne glasses are empty
We are now approaching the runway, so get ready for take off

That girls a trip, a one way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause shes got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause shes got that one international smile---Lyrics submitted by Mani Hudson.
