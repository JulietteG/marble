All along the western front
People line up to receive
She got the current in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe

Saw her in the Amazon
With the voltage running throughout her skin
Standing there with nothing on
She's gonna teach me how to swim

Oh, ooh, ooh

Said, "Ooh, ooh girl shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel"

Said, "Ooh, girl ooh, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel"

All along the eastern shore
Put your circuits in the sea
This is what the world is for
Making electricity


Cause you can feel it in your mind
Oh you can do it all the time
Plug it in and change the world
Yes, you are my electric girl

I said, "Ooh, ooh girl shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel"

Said, "Ooh, girl ooh, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl turn me on with your electric feel"

Oh, oh yea

Hey, hey

Do what ya feel now
Electric feel now

Do what ya feel now
Electric feel now

Do what ya feel now
Electric feel now---Lyrics submitted by brey.
