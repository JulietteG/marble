Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this luck
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tales

I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower at desert road

Magic, or one, or mystery
All of you trying to work on me
I would surrender myself
Holy how, and heaven high
You will open up my eyes
And I'm finally here

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, oh, at blow
Like a feather, you make me float

Love you crazy kite on your left
Lost in sweet extasy
Under nirvana finally

Magic, or one, or mystery
All of you trying to work on me
I would surrender myself
Holy how, and heaven high
You will open up my eyes
And I am finally here

This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, oh, at blow
Like a feather, you make me float

(You make me float, you make me float)

This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, oh, at blow
Like a feather, you make me float

(You make me float, oh, you make me float) ---
