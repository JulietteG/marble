I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
Cause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
Dont make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
Cause Im coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once youre mine, once youre mine
Theres no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, dont walk away

Its in the palm of your hand now baby
Its a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
Cause Im coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once youre mine, once youre mine
Theres no going back

[Juicy J's Rap Verse]
Uh, she's a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids
Cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
Cause Im coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once youre mine, once youre mine
Theres no going back---Lyrics submitted by Audrey Tombaugh.
