Nice legs, daisy dukes,
makes a man go; 
*woo woo*
Thats the way they all come through like;
*woo woo woo woo*
Low cut, see through,
shirts that make you; 
*woo woo*
Thats the way she come through like;
*woo woo woo woo*

[Chorus]

Cuz' I
just set them up, x3
to knock them down.
just set them up, x3
to knock them down.
I think I should know
How
to make love to something innocent without leavin my fingerprints out;
Now,
L-O-V-E's just another word i'll never learn to pronounce;
How,
do I say I'm sorry cuz' the word is never gonna come out;
Now,
L-O-V-E's just another word I'll never learn to pronounce.

Tight jeans, double D's
makin me go;
*woo woo*
All the people on the street know;
*woo woo woo woo*
Iced out, lit up,
make the kids go;
*woo woo*
All the people on the street know;
*woo woo woo woo*

[Chorus]

You know that type of s**t
just don't work on me;
Whistling and trying to flirt with me;
Don't take it personally;
Cause you we were never in love;
It doesn't really matter who,
you say you are;
Singin out the window,
of your car;
Find another girl,
across the bar;
Cause L-O-V-E's not what this was

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Noelle Fuller.
