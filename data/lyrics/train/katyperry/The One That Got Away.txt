The summer after high school when we first met
Wed make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned on one day, Id be losing you

In another life I would be your girl
Wed keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I dont have to say you were
The one that got away, the one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on (Oh whoa)
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
Its time to face the music, Im no longer your muse

But in another life, I would be your girl
Wed keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I dont have to say you were
The one that got away, the one that got away
The wo-oh-oh-oh-ohn! The wo-oh-oh-ohn! The wo-oh-oh-ohn!
The one that got away

All this money cant buy me a time-machine. No oh!
Cant replace you with a million rings. No oh oh oh oh!
I shouldve told you what you meant to me. Whoa!
Cause now I pay the price

In another life, I would be your girl
Wed keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I dont have to say you were
The one that got away, the one that got away
The wo-oh-oh-oh-ohn! The wo-oh-oh-ohn! The wo-oh-oh-ohn!

In another life, I would make you stay
So I dont have to say you were
The one that got away, the one that got away---Lyrics submitted by Lloyd.
