Youre in love with a girl whos in love with the world
And all I wanna do is spend a little time with you
You spend all your time waiting
Told you right from the start that Im no 9 to 5
Not planning to stay, wish I could see you every day but
Im chasing a dream for a living.

Im not what you wanted, youre not what I needed
This love is a burden, my heart can't repeat it
Ive been here before, gotta let you go
I believed in you and me, I hoped to be every thing you ever wanted
Youre asking for more, youre too insecure

Youre in love with a girl whos in love with the world
And all I wanna do is spend a little time with you
You spend all your time waiting
Told you right from the start that Im no 9 to 5
Not planning to stay, wish I could see you every day but
Im chasing a dream for a living.

You know its a fact that my suitcase is packed
Then I beg you to say its okay
I can go to the end of the world and still be your girl
Call me on the phone, say you hate to be alone
Its my fault that you almost cheated
Been here before, youre too insecure

Youre in love with a girl whos in love with the world
And all I wanna do is spend a little time with you
You spend all your time waiting
Told you right from the start that Im no 9 to 5
Not planning to stay, wish I could see you every day but
Im chasing a dream for a living.

Oh oh oh the world is calling
Oh oh oh the world is calling
All the world is big enough for me

Youre in love with a girl whos in love with the world
And all I wanna do is spend a little time with you
You spend all your time waiting
Told you right from the start that Im no 9 to 5
Not planning to stay, wish I could see you every day but
Im chasing a dream for a living.

Youre in love with a girl whos in love with the world [x3]---Lyrics submitted by sarah bagge.
