I remember every word, you tried so hard to say
I remember when your smile began to fade
And every kiss you gave
Could never hide your pain
I never thought that I'd become, what I became

But, I'm on my way back home.
I'm on my way back home.

I'm breaking with everything you've been taking
And I just thought you'd be on my side, yeah.
Pay no mind.
Cause if it's raining, the stormy weather will change into
something better it'll be alright.
Cause either way
I'm on my way back home.

Do you remember holding back?
Frozen like a stone.
Do you remember when we tried, to let it go?
It's all the same, no one's to blame 
For broken hearts 

And everything must end so something new can start.
And I'm on my way back home,
I'm on my way back home.

I'm breaking with everything you've been taking
And I just thought you'd be on my side, yeah.
Pay no mind.
Cause if it's raining, the stormy weather will change into
something better it'll be alright.
Cause either way
I'm on my way back home.

There's something about you
There's just something about you.
There's something about the way it makes me understand.

And I'm on my way back home.
I'm on my way back home.

I'm breaking with everything you've been taking
And I just thought you'd be on my side, yeah.
Pay no mind.
Cause if it's raining, the stormy weather will change into
something better it'll be alright.
Cause either way
I'm on my way back home.

And I'm on my way back home.---Lyrics submitted by k.
