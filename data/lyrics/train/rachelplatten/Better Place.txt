I'll tell the world (I'll sing a song)
It's better place since you came along
Since you came along
Your touch is like sunlight through the trees
Your kisses are the ocean breeze
Everything's alright, when you're with me

And I hold my favorite thing
I hold the love that you bring
But It feels like, I've opened my eyes again
And the colors are golden and bright again
There's a song in my heart
I feel like I belong
It's a better place since you came along
It's a better place since you came along

I see the whole world in your eyes
It's like I've known you all my life
We just feel so right, so I pour my heart into you hands
It's like you really understand, you love the way I am

And I hold my favorite thing
I hold the happiness you bring
But It feels like, I've opened my eyes again
And the colors are golden and bright again
And the sun paints the sky skies
And the wind sings our song
It's a better place since you came along
It's a better place since you came along

Now I'm alright, Now I'm alright
Everything's alright
Cause It feels like, I've opened my eyes again
And the colors are golden and bright again
There's a song in my heart, I feel like I belong
It's a better place since you came along
It's a better place since you came along---
