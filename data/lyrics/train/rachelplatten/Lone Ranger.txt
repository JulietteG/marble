Maybe I'm selfish call me see-through
But I'm debating if I really need to
Be tied, tied to someone forever
Sure I get lonely sometimes and miss being together but hey!
I wanna roam from city to city
Let the highway and the crowd fill the hunger that's in me
Fill me up with fireworks and tell me I'm skinny
I could soak up the fire in the buzz they give me

Oooo-ooooo

Long nights, stay up late
Drink the sky, meditate

Oooo-ooooo

Open eyes, sunroof
Give me miles, give me truth

Sometimes I get high, sometimes I get low
But I'm calm as can be in a room full of strangers
But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave 'cause baby I'm a lone ranger

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (I'm a Lone Ranger)

I'm a lion, I'm a tiger
I'm a caged-bird, I'm on fire
Got these paper wings, but they don't hold the air
Get so close to somebody, but I don't stay there
Much less brave than I admit
Much more scared than they all think
But I'm protecting the organ in my chest
'Cause the blood, sweat, and tears they can make quite a mess

Oooo-ooooo

Open eyes, open roof
Give me miles, give me truth

Sometimes I get high, sometimes I get low
But I'm calm as can be in a room full of strangers
But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave 'cause baby I'm a lone ranger

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
'Cause baby I'm a lone ranger

I don't want to get broken baby
I don't want to get broken baby
I don't want to get broken babe, cut open babe, cut open babe

Sometimes I get high, sometimes I get low
But I'm calm as can be in a room full of strangers
But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave 'cause baby
I'm a lone ranger

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Sometimes I get high)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
('Cause baby I'm a lone ranger)

But oh my, don't try to get close
I'm just gonna leave 'cause baby I'm a lone ranger---
