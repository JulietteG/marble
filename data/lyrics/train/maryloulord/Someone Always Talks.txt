Keep your secrets to yourself
Or they're not secrets anymore
Don't go telling no one else
Or everyone will know the score

Hey, yeah
It doesn't matter what they say to you
They could swear a vow of silence to your face
But someone always talks
Someone always talks

Make your promises alone
Keep the blueprint in your mind
Don't discuss it on the phone
You never know who's on the line

Hey, yeah
Let them call you Mr. Paranoid
It won't be you who gets destroyed by careless words
When someone always talks
Someone always talks

Hey, yeah
Don't you worry what they think of you
'Cause there is nothing that they'd rather do
Than share your thoughts
With anyone who has the time

'Cause someone always talks
Someone always talks
Someone always talks---Lyrics submitted by M.
