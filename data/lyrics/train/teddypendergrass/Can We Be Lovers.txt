[Luther Vandross]

Are you gonna be

Say that you're gonna be

[Jamie Foxx]

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh...

[Jamie Foxx - Chorus]

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross, a little Anita, will definitely set this party off right

(Are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are you gonna be are you gonna be, well well well well well)

She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton, and definitely set this party off right

(Are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are you gonna be are you gonna be, well well well well well)

[Kanye West]

I told her to drive over in your new whip

Bring some friends you cool with

Imma bring da cool whip

Then I want you to strip

See you is my new chick

So we get our grind on

She be grabbin, callin me Biggie like Shine home

Man I swear she fine homes

Why she always lying though

Tellin me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones

She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson

Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson

I play 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action

My dawg said you aint no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong

I'm a play this Vandross

You gon' take your pants off

Imma play this Gladys Knight

Me and you gon' get right

[Chorus X2]

[Twista]

Got you lookin at the gliss at my hands and wrists

While i'm layin back smokin on my canibus

When it come to rockin the rythm like Marvin and Luther

I can tell you aint no messin with Kan-man and Twist

From the Chi and I be

Sippin Hennessy

Play some R&B;

Tryina smoke a B

Lookin properly

Feelin on a G?

And always (Well Well Well Well Well)

Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne

You aint know Twista can work it like the Whispers

Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac

The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners

While I'm

Smokin on a B

Dippin through the streets

Bumpin R&B;

And I got to leave

something to the 23's?

And I do it (well well well well well)

When my earth and the wind smoke a fire

Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat

Put you in a daze for maze

Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex

You ready for the world girl

Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me

An every moment you controllin' me I'm lovin the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci

And when I come over and bend your ass

You be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass

I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow

Now I gotta go up in it fast, but imma finish last

No matter how much of a thug you see

I still spit it like it's R&B;, so to the club with me

And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and stilla be in love with me

[chorus X2]

[Twista]

Baby drop another slow jam

And all us lovers need hold hands

And if you aint got no man hop up in my Brougham

I keep it pimpin like an old man

You gots to roll with the plan

Cuz after that then I

Take it to the dome

Then I got to bone

Stay up in the zone

Got to get you home

Gotta run up on

And I do it (well well well well well)

Baby drop another slow jam

And all us lovers need hold hands

And if you aint got no man hop up on my brohem

I keep it pimpin like an old man

You gots to roll with the plan

Cuz after that then I

Take you to my home

And we could get it on

Disconnect the phone

Just to get you goin'

Tryina make you moan

And I do it (well well well well well)---Lyrics submitted by Fari.
