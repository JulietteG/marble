Close the door, let me give you what you've been waiting for,
Baby I've got so much love to give, and I wanna give it all to you.
Close the door, no need to worry no more,
Let's bring this day to a pleasant end, girl it's me and you now.
I've waited all day long just to hold you in my arms,
and it's exatly like I thought it would be
me loving you and you loving me.
Close the door let me rub your back where you say its sore,
come on and get closer and closer so close to me
let's get lost in each other. Come here baby.
I've waited all day long just to hold you in my arms
And its exactly like I thought it would be, me loving you and you loving me.
Close the door and let me blow your mind plenty good loving all through the night
and then again when the morning comes come here woman!
Come here baby let me blow your mind, let me do, what I want to you,
let me do what I want to you, let me make sweet love to you baby,
So good, so good, so good, Ohoh baby, come here baby,
do it to me, i'll do it do you. Come here baby lay your head next to mine./---Lyrics submitted by Raymond Coats.
