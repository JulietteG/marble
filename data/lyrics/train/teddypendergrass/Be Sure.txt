Be sure
My baby
That you find everything that you need in me
'cause forever is a long, long, long, long time

Be sure
My lover
'cause it would be a sin to be hurt in love again
You see I've lost this time I wanna win (I wanna win), I wanna win (I wanna win)!

Oooo just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake (better be sure)
Just be sure of it
'cause I don't want a heartbreak (better be sure)
Just be sure of it 
That's it's a game of give and take 

Be sure girl...

Be sure
My angel
It's not that I doubt you
But you see, I'm looking out for your feelings, too

Infatuation for love is no substitute

You just gotta be sure
My sweet thing
It's not so bad to apologize than to go through life
Living a lie

So whatever you do (whatever you do)...whatever you do (whatever you do)

Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake (better be sure)
Just be sure of it
'cause I don't want a heartbreak (better be sure)
Just be sure of it 
That's it's a game of give and take 

Be sure girl...

Ooooo...

...Be sure
My sweet thing
See, it's not so bad to apologize than to go through life 
Living a lie
See, so whatever you do (whatever you do)...whatever you do (whatever you do)

(Oooo) Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake (are-YOU-SURE!?)
Just be sure of it
'cause I don't want a heartbreak (are you sure?)
Just be sure of it 
That's it's a game of give and take (ARE-YOU-SURE!?)

Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake (are-YOU-SURE!?)
Just be sure of it
'cause I don't want a heartbreak (are you sure?)
Just be sure of it 
That's it's a game of give and take (PLEASE!! be sure)

My darling (you just gotta be sure), please be sure! 
Little sweet thing, be sure...
Well...

Make sure that you find, every, every, every, everything that you want in me

See this time
I feel that you and I - we - got to win
And I don't want to have to start all over again!

Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake (please be sure)
Just be sure of it
'cause I don't want a heartbreak (I'm begging you: be sure)
Just be sure of it 
That's it's a game of give and take (PLEASE BE SURE!!!)
Just be sure of it
That you don't make a mistake (HEY!! BE SURE!!)
Just be sure of it
'cause I don't want a heartbreak (PLEASE BE SU-!!!!)
Just be sure of it
That's it's a game of give and take (please be sure...)

My darling please be sure (you just gotta be sure)
Be sure you find (be sure) everything that you need in me (you just gotta be sure)
Be sure I'm everything that you want a man to be 

Please be sure.---Lyrics submitted by Nanci.
