Well it's a cold day
The sun is out but it's not shining for me
I look out, I feel you 
Around me, your voice is clear but it's not sounding okay
Let's pretend you don't know me
But you don't show a sign of slowing down

Running around, running around, face down
Lets start at somewhere in the middle
Holding your own, finding your place, beat down
Inside I know it's there

Running around, combing your ground, somewhere
This place is perfect for beginning
You'll forget about me real soon
If you put your mind to it
If you put your mind to it

Well I'm out there
Holding fast and beeping back
Where it's a nightmare
Do you get the picture
It's not fair
Hold this back just let it out
To clear the air
Can you feel the difference
But you don't know your time is running out

Running around, running around, face down
Lets start at somewhere in the middle
Holding your own, finding your place, beat down
Inside I know it's there

Running around, combing your ground, somewhere
This place is perfect for beginning
You'll forget about me real soon
If you put your mind to it

I can see this through
I'm letting go of all I have held on to
Tears can't save you now
I'm letting go of all of you that's heading out
But you don't show a sign of slowing down

Running around, running around, face down
Lets start at somewhere in the middle
Holding your own, finding your place, beat down
Inside I know it's there

Running around, combing your ground, somewhere
This place is perfect for beginning
You'll forget about me real soon
If you put your mind to it

Running around, running around, face down
Lets start at somewhere in the middle
Holding your own, finding your place, beat down
Inside I know it's there

Running around, combing your ground, somewhere
This place is perfect for beginning
You'll forget about me real soon
If you put your mind to it---Lyrics submitted by Craig.
