[Verse 1]
So bold and fine
I've known you for some time
Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods and
Down we go, down, down.
Oh boy, you're mine,
Do you remember old times?

[Chorus] (x2)
Go dear boy, I wanna follow you,
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too.
Go dear boy, I wanna be with you,
There's a time for everything and I call you.

[Verse 2]
Oh love of mine, distraction ain't a crime.
For those who find love as a game like you and I.
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we cry.
Oh boy, you're fine, do you remember old times?

[Chorus] (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
