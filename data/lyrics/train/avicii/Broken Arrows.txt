You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

Now as you wade through the shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home (home, home)
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down the walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home (home, home)
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes you're losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark---
