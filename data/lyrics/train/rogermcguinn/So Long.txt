Well I'm headin' for the good old days
I don't even have to change my ways
I got a song to sing and I'll be on my way

I've been waitin' for the time to come
Well I have to pack my bags and run
And say goodbye to all I'm leavin' behind

I say so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, so long

I say so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, so long

Well I'm leavin' for the very last time
I'm only takin' what's rightfully mine
I'd like to see you try and hold me back again

Well I'm headin' for the good old days
I don't even have to change my ways
And baby I'll be gone when I have had my say

I say so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, so long

So long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, so long

I said so long, so long
Goodbye, goodbye, so long ---Lyrics submitted by lisa carlson.
