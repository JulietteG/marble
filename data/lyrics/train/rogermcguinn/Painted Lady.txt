Painted lady inside my heart
You're tearing me apart
Leaving me just to smile
And like a child, lady, I'll take your heart
Maybe we'll make a start
Or maybe I'll turn to leave you

Oh, but I'll come back to you
Tell you I love you, I do

Lovely, lady, we've played the game
You know it still seems the same
Lady, I've lost the feeling
Is it real, if only you'd called my name
Told me I'm not to blame
For all the times I've left you

Oh but I came back to you
Tell you I love you, I do

Oh but I'll come back to you
Tell you I love you, I do

Oh but I came back to you
Tell you I love you, I do

Oh but I'll come back to you
Tell you I love you, I do

Tell you I love you, I do
Yes I do---Lyrics submitted by lisa carlson.
