Waitin' for that train they said was comin'
I had faith and waited patiently
But somethin's tellin' me
I'm waitin' hopelessly
For the train has come and gone on without me.

I struggled day and night so I'd be ready
I tried to make things right inside of me
But I've got a feelin' I'm mistaken
That the train won't come in time to rescue me.

How long has that train been gone?
Why did it leave and not take me? - I wanna know!
How long will the pain go on? 
Will it last forever, will it never leave?

A friend of mine said he don't go for Jesus
He don't take no stock in all that stuff
But he wanted to believe
'cause I saw him on his knees
Cryin', "Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy!
Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy, please!"

How long has that train been gone?
Tell me, why did it leave and not take me?
How long will the pain go on?
Will it last forever, last forever, last forever, last forever,
last forever, will it never leave?
