Come on!

I dont know just where Ive been
Guess Ive been fooling myself
Lost my way but Im back again
Ive been outside and in

Ooo baby (Ooo Ooo Ooo)
When you let me go I was free 
But freedom aint what 
I thought it would be

I thought I had no need for love
Couldnt see I was blind
When half of me walked out the door
The other stayed behind

Ooo baby (Ooo Ooo Ooo)
Please take me back
I was wrong 
Ive lived without your love for so long

So rock me gently ahahah
Roll me slowly

I cant explain just 
What Ive been going through (so rock me gently)
I cant explain how 
Much I needed you (rock me gently  OooOooOoo)
Yeah, yeah,yeah

(Solo)

Now Im back and Im here to stay 
Youve got my feet on the ground
Im so glad that you love me still
Ive been and Im found

When you let me go
I was free
I lived too long without your love
But you took me back
Though I was wrong
Cause freedom just aint what 
I thought it would be

Mmm so rock me gently ahaha
Roll me slowly, yeah

Rock me gently, mmm, yeah, yeah
Rock me gently, Oo ahh, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Antonio.
