Please slow it down
Theres a secret magic past world
That you only notice when youre looking back at it
And all I wanna do is turn around

I'm going down to sleep on the bottom of the ocean
Cause I couldnt let go when the water hit the setting sun

Passing white daisies, taking turns
Close the door walk to the street
Catching raindrops on your tongue
And for a minute it all stops
But it wont last man, just a passing moment gone

Please slow it down
Theres a secret place that I know
If I could a dig a grave Id then climb underground for good
And all I wanna do is turn around

I'm going down to sleep on the bottom of the ocean
Cause I couldnt let go when the water hit the setting sun

Passing white daisies, taking turns
All those evenings on the back deck of our first apartment
They meant everything but the wind just carried them off
And you cant go back now, just a passing moment gone

Please slow it down
Theres a secret magic past world
That you only notice when youre looking back at it
And all I wanna do is turn around

I'm going down to sleep on the bottom of the ocean
Cause I couldnt let go when the water hit the setting sun
Cause I couldnt let go of the passing moment gone---Lyrics submitted by M.
