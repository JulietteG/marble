I think we got somethin'
Hey, It's my girl Hannah, 
And Iyaz on the track right now
Hey, Let's go

Tonight were gonna get this, 
Tonight were gonna get this, 
Tonight were gonna get this, 
Were gonna get this, 
Were gonna get this.

[Verse 1]
I can here you crankin up dem speakers
I don't really wanna show up any later
Because soon were gonna party like it's new years
Oh oh oh oh

Yo I'm lovin all the music that there playin'
But I ain't hearin' anything you're sayin'
Tonight were gonna get this gonna live exquisite
Oh oh, Oh oh
(Get yo hands up)

Somebody dance beside me, 
'Cuz I'm feelin' good at this party
Yeah, I'm fly just like Bob Marley
So here we go girl, just crank it up

[Chorus]
Are you the boy, the boy, the boy
The honest truth, the real McCoy
If you're the boy, the boy, the boy
Then make me feel like a movie.

This girl, this girl, this girl
Can be the one to rock my world
So be my girl, my girl, my girl
And love me just like a movie

[Verse 2]
I can see you hangin' out in the corner, 
Lookin fly and you finally comin' over
I've been checkin' out ya, but you didn't notice
Oh Oh, Oh Oh

Tonight were gonna get this, gonna really love it
Oh Oh, Oh Oh

Somebody just said
"Hannah, do you already have a man
'Cuz I'm smooth like Joe Santana."
Well here we go boy, just crank it up

[Chorus]
Are you the boy, the boy, the boy
The honest truth, the real McCoy
If you're the boy, the boy, the boy
Then make me feel like a movie.

This girl this girl this girl
Can be the one to rock my world
So be my girl, my girl, my girl
And love me just like a movie

Yeah the time of our lives
Oh Oh, Oh Oh
[Chorus]
Are you the boy, the boy, the boy
The honest truth, the real McCoy
(We're gonna get this, my boy)
If you're the boy, the boy, the boy
Then make me feel like a movie.

This girl this girl this girl
Can be the one to rock my world
So be my girl, my girl, my girl
And love me just like a movie
(Everybody)
