la la la, la la la, la la la
how come everything turns out
leaving me with more doubt
i feel like im upside down
and i dont want to be here

i go right should of gone left
and i say thing i should of not said
look at me in this big mess
i dont want to be here

{CHORUS}
everything i do, is making me more confused
oh, it used to be easy, all i had to be was me
now im mixed up
everywhere i go, is somewhere that i don't know
oh, i hope that im dreaming, cause im sick of this feeling
im mixed up, somebody help me

la la la, la de la
tell me how to fix this
i'd trade my world for one wish
to go back to my other life,
when i got it right

{CHORUS}

to hold me, tell me everything's gonna
be okay, cause today, it feels like i want
make it through the darkness
dont know how to get out of this
im so mixed up, somebody help me
(la la la)

{CHORUS}---
