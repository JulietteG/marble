you walk away from me tonight
not knowing the real me
cause you believe in all the hype
i just stepped out of a magazine

take away the glamour the world let it show
and forget everything you know
take away the mirrors the limos the lights
cause i don't wanna dress up tonight

chorus
i'm gonna put on my old blue jeans
i'm gonna walk out of here and into the street
would you put up resistance
would it make a difference
would you know the real me 
me and my old blue jeans

you think i'm unapproachable
bet i don't feel enough
she'll read a book cover to cover
and not be so quick to judge

take away the glamour the make up the clothes
and forget everyhing you know
take away the ego the trick of the lights
cause i don't wanna dress up tonight

chorus 2x

i wanna show you what i get

chorus 3x

me and my old blue jeans---Lyrics submitted by mariam.
