Take the world
Shake and stir
And that's what I got goin' on
I throw my cares up in the air
And I don't think they're comin' down
Yeah, I love how it feels right now

This is the life! Hold on tight!
And this is the dream
It's all I need!
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah
I'm still getting it right
This is the Life

Takin' in a whole new scene
And I'm swimming with a new crowd (crowd)
Breakin' down the old four walls
And building them up from the ground
I love how it feels right now

This is the life! (life!)
Hold on tight! (hold on, hold on!)
And this is the dream! (dream!)
It's all I need! (hold on!)
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time yeah.
And I'm still getting it right
This is the life

Gonna follow my own lead, yeah!
Kick back and feel the breeze!
Nothing but the blue sky!
As far as I can see!

This is the life
Hold on tight!
And this is the dream!
It's all I need!
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah
I'm still getting it right

This is the life! (life! Yeah!)
Hold on tight! (hold on, hold on!)
And this is the dream! (dream!)
It's all I need! (hold on!)
You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time yeah
I'm still getting it right
This is the Life
