Are you overloaded
Candycoated
Your life's imploding now
There's a risk worth taking
A pain worth aching
On this hollow ground
(We can) Let go
Don't hold on
To all of life's hardest parts
When we think of stopping
Let's keep on rockin'
To the rhythm of our hearts

CHORUS:
We can, we can
Break outta here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race,
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken

Find the magic
Go and grab it
Your fate is in your hands
Come on, find a reason to believe in
Just tell yourself
We can!

CHORUS:
We can, we can
Break outta here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can we can forget the pace
Win in our own race,
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken

BRIDGE:
Get off your seat
On your feet
Raise your hands
Feel the beat
Let it go
Lose control
Feel it in your soul
Don't you know what you can do
If you have faith in you
Let's not be invisible
There's no red light in life
Just go!

Chorus:
We can, we can break outta here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pain
Win in our own race,
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken

Yeah

Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can
Oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can, oh we can

Good and broken!---Lyrics submitted by clarissa.
