I'm more than just 
Your average girl 
I'd like to turn me up 
And show the world 

Aw yeah! 

'Cause some can talk the talk 
But this girl just wants to rock 
I'm individual 
I'm not like anyone 

I can be glamorous 
Just like you see in all the magazines 
I can be cool as ice 
Or anything I want to be 

Who said, who said I can't be Superman 
I say, I say that I know I can 
Who said, who said I won't be President 
I say, I say you ain't seen nothin' yet 

Aw yeah. 
Yeah
Come on and make some noise 
Every girl has her choice 
To lead their own parade 
I do it my way 

ow!!
I can be soft and sweet 
Or louder than the radio 
I can be sophisticated 
Or totally go (totally go) ...outta control 

Who said, who said I can't be Superman 
I say, I say that I know I can 
Who said, who said I'm not electrified
I say i say

There's no holdin' back hangin right on track
'Cause you control the game
So let 'em know your name
No limitations on imagination
Imagine that!

yeah!
Who said, who said I can't be worldwide 
I say, I say time is on my side 


Who said, who said I can't be ten feet tall 
I say, I say that I can have it all 

Who said, who said I can't be Superman 
I say, I say that I know I can 
Who said, who said I won't be President 
I say, I say you ain't seen nothin' 
Yet you ain't seen nothing yet 

Whooaaaa 
Yeahhhh.
Who said 

Come on 

Yeah
That's right!---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
