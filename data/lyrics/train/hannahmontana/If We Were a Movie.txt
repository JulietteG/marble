uh, oh
there you go again talkin cinnamatic
ya you, you're charming
got everybody starstruck
i know how you always seem to go

for the obvious
instead of me 
but get a ticket and you'll see

if we were a movie 
you'd be the right guy 
and i'd be the best friend 
that you'd fall in love with
in the end we'd be laughing
watchin the sunset
fade to black, show the names
play that happy song

yeah
yeah, yeah when you 
call me i can hear it in your voice

oh sure!
wanna see me 
and tell me all about her 
la la

ill be acting through my tears 
guess you'll never know  that i should win
an oscar for this scene im in 

 if we were a movie 
you'd be the right guy 
and i'd be the best friend 
that you'd fall in love with
in the end we'd be laughing
watchin the sunset
fade to black, show the names
play that happy song

wish i could tell you there's a twist 
some kind of hero in disguise
and were together it's for real 
now playing

wish i could tell you 
there's a kiss 
like somthin more in my mind
i see it could be amazing

if we were a movie 
you'd be the right guy 
and i'd be the best friend 
that you'd fall in love with
in the end we'd be laughing
watchin the sunset
fade to black, show the names
play that happy song

if we were a movie 
you'd be the right guy 
and i'd be the best friend 
that you'd fall in love with
in the end we'd be laughing
watchin the sunset
fade to black, show the names
play that happy song

 if we were a movie 
you'd be the right guy 
and i'd be the best friend 
that you'd fall in love with
in the end we'd be laughing
watchin the sunset
fade to black, show the names
play that happy song---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
