When I feel all alone and nobody knows
Still gotta smile for a while I can't let it show
Dry my tears,
Hide my fears

And when I'm backstage feelin down and the lights come on 
No time to worry, gotta hurry gotta sing my song
Gotta shake it off
And strike a pose

Snap my fingers just like that, dont get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that, dont get what I want, just cuz I want it

I'm super cool, super hot, livin like a rockstar
You think I'm super, you think I'm super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super super, I'm super duper
So you wanna be just like, so you wanna be just like, 
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watchin me, it's never as easy as it seems
To be super super, to be super supergirl

When I walk in the room everybody stops
Cameras flashin, people fightin for the best shot
They like my hair,
The clothes I wear

Everybody wants to know what I'm doing next
Sometimes I wish I could stay home, just be by myself
I wanna be,
Walkin free, can't you see

Snap my fingers just like that don't get what I want and that's a fact
Snap my fingers just like that don't get what I want, just cuz i want it

(Chorus)

Wish you could see I'm like everybody else
I'm strugglin to let go and always be myself...

I'm super cool, super hot, (super)
I'm super super
I'm super super
On the cover of your magazine
Wherever I go they make a scene
I'm super super
I'm super super
So you wanna be just like, so you wanna be just like'
Think you wanna be just like me
Everybody's watchin me, it's never as easy as it seems
To be super super
To be super supergirl---Lyrics submitted by tapeka.
