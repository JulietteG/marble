{HOOK}
Why would you rather be,
Anywhere else with me?
I tell you man, its all right here
(Where ever we are...x2...)
Check out the scenery
We won the lottery
I tell you man, its all right here

{CHORUS}
And i can't believe you'd even think,
Of being any place, any place around here
the grass may be greener in the end, i swear
but you'll be wishing you were here if you were there

its where ever we go 
(where ever we are...x4... its all right here)
[excuse me officer]

If you're smart you know you wanna be in the mix of white hot energy
its all to welcome you
time so good its moving way too fast if we could i know we'd make it last
its all here for you...x3... its all right here
(where ever we are...x4...)
its all right here (its all right here) its all right here
(where ever we are...x2...) c'mon
(where ever we are) c'mon lets go!
(where ever we are) its all right here

any open road, any open road will take us anywhere
as long as im with you i won't care where!
and we can choose the desert or the sea
cause the good times are in front of you and me

{HOOK}

{CHORUS}
wish you were here you wish you were here!

and if i could
make you wanna stay just one more day
maybe everything would be okay
c'mon...x3...its all right here!
(where ever we are...x4...its all right here)
its all right here!
(where ever we are...x4...its all right here)---
