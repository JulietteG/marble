L-O-V-E,  L-O-V-E,  L-O-V-E,  L-O-V-E...
I see your face the look
in your eyes, what you feel is no surprise,
everyone needs something to believe in.
Tell me your dreams I'll tell you
mine, in our hearts we'll look inside
and see all the colors of the rainbow...
I know...

[Chorus]

We all wanna believe in love.
We all wanna believe in somethin'
bigger than just us.
We all wanna be a part, of the 
greater picture, that's hangin' in our
hearts (our hearts), that's whats bigger than us

I wanna see beyond a my own little world,
Grab our hands and we can twirl
around the galaxy (galaxy), see the world
with clarity oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we have such 
a long way to go (to go), and I know, were getting 
closer every day, (every day)

[Chorus]

And feel the universe
and light the sky above
and rescue's all our hearts
with love, (L-O-V-E) love, oh with love (L-O-V-E) 
that's bigger than us (bigger than us, come on!)
its love, it's love, that's bigger than us
it's love, it's love, that's bigger than us
it's love, it's love, it's love, it's love, it's love, it's love.
We all wanna believe in love, 
We all wanna believe in somethin'
Bigger than just us.---Lyrics submitted by la.
