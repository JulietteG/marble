ohhh
yeah
yeah
yeahhh

Every morning I wake up to find I 
always dream the same

Every night I come to my window 
When you call my name

But the way the words you say 
Just fall like rain

Till I'm drowning
In the sound of
Your invitation

[Chorus]
When you ask
"Do you wanna dance, my barefoot Cinderella?
Dont need no slippers or a party dress,
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best"
And then you
say "Do you wanna take a chance?  Stay with my forever
No one will ever be more beautiful, 
my barefoot
my barefoot cinderella."

Yeaaah
Ohh

A dream world is alway perfect 
but that's not my real life

I wish you did but you don't know the me
I am inside

I pray that you'll come lookin' and
I won't hide (won't hide)

I'm smiling
When you find me
Cuz I've been waiting

(Chorus)
For you to ask
"Do you wanna dance, my barefoot Cinderella?
Dont need no slippers or a party dress,
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best"
And then you
say "Do you wanna take a chance?  Stay with my forever
No one will ever be more beautiful, 
my barefoot
my barefoot cinderella."

When I close my eyes
it starts 
yeah,
like a movie,
or my heart

Here comes my favorite part.
Yeaahhhh
Ohhhh

When you ask
"Do you wanna dance, my barefoot Cinderella?
Dont need no slippers or a party dress,
you're what I like the best"
And then you
say "Do you wanna take a chance?  Stay with my forever
No one will ever be more,
beautiful, 
my barefoot
my barefoot cinderella."

(Chorus)
For you to ask
"Do you wanna dance, my barefoot Cinderella?
Dont need no slippers or a party dress,
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best"
And then you
say "Do you wanna take a chance?  Stay with my forever
No one will ever be more beautiful, 
my barefoot
my barefoot cinderella."
