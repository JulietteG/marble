Gonna stay in bed today
Cause I can't stand the light
Don't know why I get so down
I won't be much fun tonight
And I can't believe
You still wanna hang around me

It's not so pretty all the time
You don't mind 
To you it's all right

AS I AM
IS HOW YOU TAKE ME
NEVER TRY TO PUSH
OR MAKE ME DIFFERENT
WHEN I TALK YOU LISTEN TO ME
AS I AM 
IS HOW YOU WANT ME AND
I KNOW I'VE FOUND THE PIECE THAT'S MISSING
I'M LOOKING AT HIM

I'm not the girl you think you see
But maybe that's a lie
You almost know me better than
Me, myself and I
Don't know a lot of things
But I know what I got

It's not so perfect everyday
I don't have to try
Cause it all falls into place

AS I AM
IS HOW YOU TAKE ME
NEVER TRY TO PUSH
OR MAKE ME DIFFERENT
WHEN I TALK YOU LISTEN TO ME

AS I AM
IS HOW YOU WANT ME AND
I KNOW I'VE FOUND THE PIECE THAT'S MISSING
I'M LOOKING AT HIM

Face to face, eye to eye
You're standing there
Feels good on the inside
I don't mind, I don't care
You're standing there
Seeing me for the first time
Seeing me for the first time....---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
