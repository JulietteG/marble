(L.O.V.E. love, L.O.V.E...)

I see your face, I look in your eyes,
What you feel is no surprise,
Everyone needs something to believe in,
Tell me your dreams, Ill tell you mine,
In our hearts well look inside,
And see all of the colors of the rainbow,
I know!

[Chorus]
We all want to believe in love,
We all want to believe in something,
Bigger than just us,
We all want to be a part,
Of the greater picture,
That's hangin' in our hearts,
Yeah it's bigger than us!

I want to see beyond my own little world,
Grab your hands so we can twirl around the galaxy,
see the world with clarity,
Oh-oo-oh,
We all have a long way to go,
But I know,
Were getting closer everyday,
Everyday!

[Chorus]
We all want to believe in love,
We all want to believe in something,
Bigger than just us,
We all want to be a part,
Of the greater picture,
That's hangin' in our heart,
Yeah bigger than us!

It fills the universe,
It lights the skies above,
It rescues our hearts with love,

(L.o.v.e, love)with love!(l.o.v.e, love)
Thats whats bigger than us! (bigger than us, c'mon)

Its love, its love, that's bigger than us

Its love, its love, that's bigger than us
(Whoo!)
Its love, its love! (its love, its love!)


We all want to believe in love,

We all want to believe in something,

Bigger than just us!---Lyrics submitted by Carmen.
