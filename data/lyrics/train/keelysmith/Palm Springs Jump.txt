Gotta get my luggage packed
Leavin town I wont be back, Jump Jump dance an swing
Everybodys jumpin down in palm springs
If you have a buck or two, tell ya what ya gotta do
Go watch the yuppies swing
Everybodys jumpin down in palm springs
While the snow is fallin on the mountain top
Hear the music callin, boy it never stops
If you wanna dancin song, comon down where you belong If you wanna have a fling
Everybodys jumpin down in palm springs
(Instr)
Comon get your luggage packed
Meet me by the railroad track
Jump Jump dance an swing
Everybodys jumpin down in palm springs
If you have a buck or two, tell ya what ya gotta do 
Go watch the yuppies swing 
Everybodys jumpin down in palm springs 
Still it keeps on snowin, on that mountain top 
Hear that music blowin, man it never stops 
If you wanna dancin song, comon down where you belong If you wanna have a fling 
Everybodys jumpin down in palm springs 
You gotta join em jumpin down in palm springs
Man there all jumpin down in palm springs---Lyrics submitted by Bradley Keane.
