Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
Two fly girls from the city
Well what other girls or what to be
I just do it like this...

Well I'm Bunny D and I'm Lady T
Raping on the mic subductively
One kiss for my lips
Will not get to your nips
But that is for your homeboys that we may tease

Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm
(T-T-T-Tigra and Bunny)
Tigra and Bunny better yet L'Trimm

(L-L-L-Trimm)

Well I am Tigra and I'm on the prowl
When I see a fine guy I lettin' so growl
But they don't effect my raping and they don't effect me
Because I'm strong and I'm bold on the M-I-C
Well I can't say that I'm honest cause I've never been but
Don't put me to the test cause you'll never win
You see I am Tigra the lady tiger
And when you see me I can never be finer so,
Don't miss a step and take a dime
Because dissing me will be a waste of time
I got ten boys on my left and twenty men on my right
And I can play with their heads
They don't put up a fight
Because were...

Cause we're sweet like sour, like sugar, and spice
And all the guys are on us like white on rice
Yes sweet like sugar, but tasty like spice 
And when we walk through the door we know we look nice
We could be good and we could be bad
You only get the myth we already had
So forget the rest, we are the best
We captivate your mind even when were dressed
So all you stinky hoes just step aside
Cause we'll rob your man like Bonnie and Clyde

We are whipped, as you can see
So hit Bunny, bust a rhyme for me...

Well my name is Bunny and I'm so damn fine
I'm the kinda girl that will blow your mind
Cause with a wink of my eye I will make you see
All the voices of the Lady B
Yes I am Bunny D and I'm short and fine
I'll take your man and I'll still hang with mine
And if you keep dissing then I'll bust your rhyme
And if you keep talking then you will be mine
Cause Uhh, I'm not playing, this is true 
My name is Bunny D and I'm here to rock you
I'm here to show you what I got
And let me tell you baby that's an awful lot
I know that you think that I look sophisticated 
And believe me baby I'm not overrated 
Cause a A-B-C-D-E-F-G
I know that you wish you can be with me
Hit it!
