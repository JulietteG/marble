I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light 
Walking down by the bay, on the shore, staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore 
I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold 
Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt 
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before 
You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me 
Running into the dark underground 
All the subways around create a great sound 
To my emotion fatigue: farewell 
With your ear to a seashell 
You can hear the waves in underwater caves 
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room 

Time together is just never quite enough 
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home 
What will it take to make or break this hint of love? 
We need time, only time 
When were apart whatever are you thinking of? 
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? 
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love? 
All the time, all the time 

Can you believe that the crew has gone and wouldn't let me sign on? 
All my islands have sunk in the deep, so I can hardly relax or even oversleep 
I feel as if I were home some nights when we count all the ship lights 
I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow 
Well turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow

So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love? 
All the time

Time together is just never quite enough 
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home 
What will it take to make or break this hint of love? 
We need time, only time 
When were apart whatever are you thinking of? 
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? 
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love? 
All the time, all the time

Time together is just never quite enough
When were apart whatever are you thinking of? 
What will it take to make or break this hint of love? 
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love? 
All the time---Lyrics submitted by carmen.
