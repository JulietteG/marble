There's the snow
Look out below
And bundle up
Cause here it comes

Run out side
So starry eyed
 A snowball fight breaks out
And winter has finally begun

I twirl through the driveway with angelic grace
Til' i slip on the side walk and fall on my face

This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet
I don't need to taste to believe

Whats December without Christmas eve?


Hop In the sleigh 
And we'll glide away
Into the night
And we'll sip on  moonlight

Runny nose
My frosty toes
Are getting cold but I feel alive
So i smile wide

The snowflakes start falling
and I start to float 
Til' my mean older brother stuffs snow down my coat

This peppermint winter is so sugar sweet 
I dont need to taste to believe
Whats December without Christmas eve?

All this holiday cheer
Heaven knows where its goes
But it returns every year
And though this winter does nothing but storm 
The joy in my heart is ablaze
And its keeping me WARM
ITS KEEPING ME WARM
ITS KEEPING ME WARM


I RIP OFF THE WRAPPING AND TEAR THROUGH THE BOX TIL' I END UP WITH  45 NEW PAIRS OF SOCKS
THIS PEPPERMINT WINTER IS SO SUGAR SWEET I DON'T NEED TO TASTE TO BELIEVE
WHATS DECEMBER WITHOUT CHRISTMAS EVE?---Lyrics submitted by Dionis.
