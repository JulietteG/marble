The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Poor me a heavy dose of atmosphere
Cause I'll dose off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you dear
Cause I wish you were here

I'll watch the night turn light blue
But It's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly
The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
Cause the spaces between my fingers are 
Right where yours fit perfectly

I'll find a pose in new ways
For I haven't slept in two days
Cause cold nastalgia chills me to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist deep in thought because when I think of you
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone

As many times as I blink 
I'll think of you
Tonight
I'll think of you tonight

When violet eyes
Get brighter
And heavy wings
Grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again
And I'll forget the world
That I knew
But I swear I won't forget you
Oh, if my voice could reach back to the past
I'd whisper in your ear
Oh darling, 
I wish you were here.---Lyrics submitted by Michele.
