Light up the sky
Shy violet angel eyes
Light up the sky
Shy violet angel eyes

She dried my eyes and drifted off while every tear was held aloft
The heavy rain clouds felt terrible cause she made my stormy sky beautiful
She made my stormy sky beautiful 

Light up the sky
Shy violet angel eyes
(Beautiful)
Light up the sky
Shy violet angel eyes
(Beautiful)
Light up the sky
Shy violet angel eyes
(Beautiful)
Light up the sky
Shy violet angel eyes
(Beautiful)
Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful,
She made my stormy sky beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Sandy.
