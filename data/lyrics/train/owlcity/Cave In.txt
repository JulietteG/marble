Please take a long, hard look through your textbook
'Cause I'm history
When I strap my helmet on, I'll be long gone
'Cause I've been dying to leave
Yeah, I'll ride the range
And hide all my loose change 
In my bedroom
'Cause riding a dirt bike
Down a turnpike 
Always takes its toll
On me

I've had just about enough
Of quote, "Diamonds in the Rough"
Because my backbone is paper thin
Get me out of this cavern
Or I'll cave in
If the bombs go off, the sun will still be shining
[The sun will still be shining]
Because I've heard it's said that every mushroom cloud 
Has a silver lining
[Though I'm always undermining too deep to know]

Swallow a drop of 
Gravel and blacktop
'Cause the road tastes like wintergreen
The wind and the rain
Smell of oil and octane
Mixed with stale gasoline
I'll soak up the sound, try to sleep on the wet ground
I'll get ten minutes give or take
'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy
When cold integrity 
Keeps me wide awake

Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in

Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in 

I'll
Keep my helmet on
Just in case my head caves in
[In case my head caves in]
'Cause if my thoughts collapse or my framework snaps, 
It'll make a mess
Like you wouldn't believe
Tie my handlebars to the stars so I stay on track
[So I stay on track]
And if my intentions stray
I'll wrench them away
Then I'll take my leave
And I won't even look back

I won't even look back---Lyrics submitted by Jeffy.
