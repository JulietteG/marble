This is a world of dreams and reverie, 
Where I felt the stars explode around me.
A grass blade flashed with a gleam,
As it slashed open a moon beam, 
Then I stared back breathlessly.
As mountains of fruit tumbled out, 
I barely had the chance to shout, 
A strawberry avlanche crashed over me.

(Music Chorus)

Staying awake that night, was rather harsh, 
Deep in a sleeping bag in your back yard.
When we woke a berry alive, 
Beneath the fruity landslide, 
We both laughed hysterically. 
It could've been just another dream, 
But I swear I heard you scream,
"A strawberry avalanche crashed over me."

(Music Chorus)

Oh, there's a citrus constellation in the galaxy, 
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids, 
That I've been dying to see.
If you were a beautiful sound in the echos all around, 
Then I'd be your harmony. 
And we'd sing along with the crowds, 
Beneath the candy coated clouds, 
Oh, strawberry avalanche please crash over me.

(Music Chorus)

This is a world of dreams and reverie,
When I felt the stars explode around me.---Lyrics submitted by tiana.
