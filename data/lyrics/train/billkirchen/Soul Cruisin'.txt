(song written by J. New)

I used to be wound up with nervous intent
I always had my foot on the gas
Almost burnt out by twenty one
My life was pushin by so fast
The people you know, that a life of speed
It never really goes nowhere
Its those subtle moves and easy grooves
That's still gonna get you there

They call it so oh oh oh oul cruisin,
They call it so oh oh oh oul cruisin

I used to strike out with all the ladies
I guess I pushed em much too hard
I wanted so to impress, that I just never guessed
My love was held in such low regard
But a real fine girl, shes a friend of mine
And I love her to this day
She calmed me down, turned me around
She showed me theres a better way

She got me so oh oh oh oul cruisin
She got me so oh oh oh oul cruisin

Guitar solo
Pedal steel solo

Youre chasin that money
Youre chasin your fate
Just take it easy and try to concentrate

Cos its so oh oh oh oul cruisin
Mmm Momma so oh oh oh oul cruisin
Were goin so oh oh oh oul cruisin
Yeah were goin so oh oh oh oul cruisin---Lyrics submitted by Mark Partington.
