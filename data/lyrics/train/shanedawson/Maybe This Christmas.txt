It's Christmas time and Santa's here
Making the children smile
But he's just a pedophile, so you better watch yo child
Christmas trees in every house covered in shiny lights
But they just turn brown and die or set your whole house on fire

These are the reasons I hate this season but Ima give it a try
Maybe this year I won't be sad on Christmas
Maybe I'll have a happy holiday
Replace my heartache and my pain, with mistletoe and candy canes
This Christmas will go my way

Having fun with all your friends sipping on that eggnog
But it just looks like jizz all over your upper lips
House made out of ginger bread cookies like Christmas trees
Giving you heart disease and type two diabetes (it's only diabetes)

These are the reasons I hate this season but Ima give it a try
Maybe this year I won't be sad on Christmas
Maybe I'll have a happy holiday
Replace my heartache and my pain, with mistletoe and candy canes
This Christmas will go my way

I've never seen a reindeer fly
I've never heard the sleigh bells ring
Never seen a snowman come to life
I've never heard the angels sing
But I hope and I pray that maybe his Christmas day that'll change

Maybe this year I won't be sad on Christmas
Maybe I'll have a happy holiday
Replace my heartache and my pain, with mistletoe and candy canes
This Christmas will go my way

Maybe this year I won't be sad on Christmas
Maybe I'll have a happy holiday
Replace my heartache and my pain, let's just dance the night away
This Christmas will go my way

Just dance with me---Lyrics submitted by Jason Ramirez.
