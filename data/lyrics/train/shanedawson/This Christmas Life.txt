If life was like a Christmas movie
I wouldn't have a care or worry
And everything would always turn out fine

Making angels in the snow
Kissing under mistletoe
And everyone would always have a smile

But baby
Life isn't that easy
Sometimes it gets crazy
I'm falling on my knees
Yeah

I'm hoping
For a happy ending
So let's stop pretending
What love could be

There'll be dancing and singing
This Christmas life
And the bells will be ringing
This Christmas life
No more heartaches from heartbreaks
This Christmas life
Oh I
Wish you could be mine

If I lived up on the North Pole
I would stare outside my window
And look around at all the shining lights

Christmas carols at the front door
Family at the dinner table
And every night would always end
Just fine

But baby
Life isn't that easy
Sometimes it gets crazy
I'm falling on my knees
Yeah

I'm hoping
For a happy ending
So let's stop pretending
What love could be

There'll be dancing and singing
This Christmas life
And the bells will be ringing
This Christmas life
No more heartaches from heartbreaks
This Christmas life
Oh I
Wish you could be mine

So I just close my eyes
And create a wonderland where
Anything's possible
That I'm just dreaming of
What it would be

There'll be dancing and singing
This Christmas life
And the bells will be ringing
This Christmas life
No more heartaches from heartbreaks
This Christmas life
Oh I
Wish you could be mine

There'll be dancing and singing
This Christmas life
And the bells will be ringing
This Christmas life
No more heartaches from heartbreaks
This Christmas life
Oh I---
