I'm, running out of time
I hope that I can save you somehow
If I, If I had superpowers
I'd save the world and you would be mine, mine

Have no fear, your hero is here
My supersense is telling me that danger is near
I'm getting close to you so I can watch your back
A villain's on the loose and he is ready to attack, oh

But i'm not a superhero
I'm not that kinda guy
But I can save you, baby, give me a try.

Cause I'm running out of time
I know what I came to do and I didn't come to lose 
So I'll fight until your mine
And when trouble comes around I won't be backing down, tonight

Ooooooooh, if you're in danger
Ooooooooh, I'm here to save you
Ooooooooh, that's what I'm made of
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Give you my superluv

Fighting for your love for all this time
What I gotta do to make you mine
Got no super speed but I'm running this town
If you get I'm my way, Ima take you down

But, i'm not a superhero
I'm not that kinda guy
But I can save you, baby, give me a try.

Cause I'm running out of time
I know what I came to do and I didn't come to lose 
So I'll fight until your mine
And when trouble comes around I won't be backing down, tonight

Ooooooooh, if you're in danger
Ooooooooh, I'm here to save you
Ooooooooh, that's what I'm made of
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Give you my super luv

(insturmental)

Can't you see?, were meant to be
So come with me say your mine
Don't keep me waiting

Cause I'm running out of time
I know It want can you do, I know I did it kinda loose,
So I'll fight until your mine
Any trouble comes around I won't be backing down, tonight

Ooooooooh, if you're in danger
Ooooooooh, i'm here to save you
Ooooooooh, that's what I'm made of
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 

Give you my superluv (x4)

And all you really need, has been right infront of you this whole time
And I, I didn't need no superpowers
I saved the world and now you are mine
Now you're mine---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
