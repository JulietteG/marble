Hear my cry, O God
Give heed to my prayer
From the ends of the earth I call to thee
When my heart is faint
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I
For thou hast been a refuge for me
And a tower of strength against the enemy
A tower of strength against the enemy
And let me dwell in thy tent forever
Hear my cry, O God
Hear my cry, O Father
Hear my cry, O God---Lyrics submitted by Mishar.
