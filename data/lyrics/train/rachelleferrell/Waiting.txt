1st Verse

Boy, Ive been watching you for so long
Oh, and I like what I see
I cant explain what makes you so
Attractive to me
Its something bout the way you wear your hair
And the scent of your cologne
Doesnt really matter what you wear
You dont need nothing on

Chorus

Ive been waitingfor you to be mine
Patiently waiting, mhmm for the right time

2nd Verse

I just cant wait to get to know you
For you feel like a friend
I cant ignore whatever it is that makes you so
Different from other men
Anticipating, any moment now
When youll walk through that door
Into my home, my heart, my life
And its just what Ive been waiting for!

Chorus

Ive been waitingfor you to be mine
Patiently waiting, umhm for the right time
Ive been waiting, waiting for you

Bridge

Youll be my knight in armor, and Ill be your queen
Well be together, at last well share the dream
Nothins gonna stop us now
Come lets begin right away, why not today?
Cause

Chorus

Ive been waitingfor you to be mine
Patiently waiting, umhm for the right time
Ive been waiting, waiting for you---Lyrics submitted by Annastasia.
