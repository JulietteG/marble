When you're weary, when you're worn
When your spirit is almost gone
When the light of your eye
is endanger of expiring
Oh, run to me
Run to me baby

When you're lonely, and it's cold inside
When your soul is anxious
And you don't know why
When your heart is in doubt
And you can't go on and let it on out
Oh, run to me
Run to me baby

Oh run to me, oh run to me

When you need shelter from the storm
I'll be the blanket to keep you warm
You know I will you know I will
hey hey hey hey

When your surely need to cry out
I'll be a sound board you can rely on
You know I will you know I will
hey hey hey hey

Run
Hey, baby
I need you to run to me
When you need me 
Baby, run on to me---Lyrics submitted by Jeannette.
