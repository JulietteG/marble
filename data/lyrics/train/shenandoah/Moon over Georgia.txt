He owns a big estate, just south of Savannah
And a high rise hotel in downtown Atlanta
And half the state of Georgia to his name.

She'd be set for life in his colonial manor
He laid the world at her feet on a silver platter
But all I had to offer her was the moon.

(Chorus)
And she took the Moon Over Georgia
She'd rather have a million stars in the sky
Than a gold mine
She took the Moon Over Georgia
When it came down to his world or mine
She took the Moon Over Georgia

A little country house in need of expansion
It's a far cry from his south Georgia Mansion
But we've got our own paradise.

Shadow dancing til dawn with the full moon shining
And those occasional clouds all have a silver lining
There really must be something about that old yellow light

(Chorus)
But she took the Moon Over Georgia
She'd rather have a million stars in the sky
Than a gold mine
She took the Moon Over Georgia
When it came down to his world or mine
She took the Moon Over Georgia

She took the Moon Over Georgia---Lyrics submitted by Peggy.
