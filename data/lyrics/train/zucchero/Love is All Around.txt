Love is connection 
Love is your strength.

Love is tomorrow 
Love is a chain. 

Love is the night time 
Love makes you cry. 

Love is the role of 
A stupid lie. 

Love is... 
Love... is all around.

Love is the passion 
Love is a train.

Love is emotion 
Thru the pouring rain. 

Love is the message
That's coming down.

Love is around you 
Just come to town. 

Love is... 
Love is... it's all around. 

Love is... 
Love... it's all around. 

Love is in motion 
Stay and surrender.

Making the spirit 
Love is the future.

Love is the feeling
And understanding. 

Love... is all around.

Love is connection 
Love is your strength.

Love is tomorrow 
Love is a chain. 

Love is the night time 
Love makes you cry. 

Love is the role of 
A stupid lie. 

Love is... 
Love... is all around.

Love is...
Love... it's all around.

Love is in motion 
Stay and surrender.

Making the spirit 
Love is the future.

Love is the feeling
And understanding. 

Love is all around
Love is all around.

Love is...
Make in love is... it's all around.

Love is...
Ahh... it's all around.

Ahh... say love's
Love... it's all around.

Love's... 
Ahh... it's all around.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
