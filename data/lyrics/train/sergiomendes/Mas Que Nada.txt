Oba Oba Oba 
Oaria raio 
Oba Oba Oba 

Mas que nada 
Black eyed peas came in to make it hotter 
We beat the party starters 
Bubblin up just like lava 
Like lava heat it like a sauna 
Penetrating into your body armor 
Rhythmically we massage ya 
With hip hop mixed up with samba 
With samba so yes yes y'all 
You know we never stop 
We never rest y'all 
The black eyed peas are keeping it funky fresh y'all 
And we won't stop until we get ya, til we get ya 
Say it

Oaria raio 
Oba Oba Oba 
Oaria raio 
Oba Oba Oba 

Peter piper picked peppers but Tab rocked ryhmes 
1,2,3 for several times 
Heavy rotation played by every kind 
Radio stations blasting every mind 
And we crossing boundaries like everyday 
???????????????????????? 
We got we got tab magnification tab magnified 
Like every day 
So yes yes y'all 
You know we never stop we never rest y'all y'all 
The black eyed peas are keeping it funky fresh y'all 
And we won't stop until we get ya, til we get ya sayin 

Oaria raio 
Oba Oba Oba (la la la la la) 
Oaria raio 
Oba Oba Oba 

Drop hot hot be my daily operation 
Got to put a right in this crazy occupation 
Gotta keep it movin' that's the motivation 
Gotta ride the waves and keep a tight relation 
With my team keeping moving and doing it right 
I've been in a lab every day til daylight 
That's the way things move in this monkey business 
We took a old samba song and remixed it 

Mas que nada 
Sai da minha frente 
Eu quero passar 
Pois o samba esta animado 
O que eu quero e sambar 
Este samba 
Que e misto de maracatu 
E samba de preto velho 
Samba de preto tu 

Mas que nada, we gonna make you feel lil hotter 
The peas and Sergio Mendes heating up sambaaaa 
Badabababababaaaaaa 
Sergio play your piano sergio play your yo yo yo yo piano (echoing) 

Check it out
