Dance, dance, dance 
Rap, rap, rap 
Roll, roll, roll 
Contigo carino mio 

Did I tell you how I like it? 
I like everything about it, baby 
What a 
I've been dancing for a decade 
Fell in love with it the first day, baby 
Que es lo que se? 

Como bailas, como cantas 
Collaboration, but the answer girl it's all about 
The color you have inside 

So dance, dance, dance (oh!) 
Baby rap, rap, rap (oh!) 
Let's to roll, roll, roll (oh!) 
Contigo carino mio 

I like to dance, dance, dance (oh!) 
I like to rap, rap, rap (oh!) 
I like to to roll, roll, roll (oh!) 
Contigo carino mio 

You make me wanna salsa 
You make me wanna cha cha 
Slow down, get up and down 
Mueve la cintura, turn it around 

If I tell you that I'm feeling 
The same way it's like I'm healing, baby 
You're a listening 
This steps being light my heart it 
I feel like working my feet 
Baby, it's impressing 

Como bailas, como cantas 
Collaboration, but the answer boy it's all about 
The love that we have inside 

So dance, dance, dance (oh!) 
Baby rap, rap, rap (oh!) 
Let's to roll, roll, roll (oh!)
