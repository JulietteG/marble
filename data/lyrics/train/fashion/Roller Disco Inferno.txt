We stop the clocks and turn away!
We glue ourselves to the chair so we won't go anywhere.
'till there just nothing left to say.
And we can go back to bed, continue to play dead.
(owohohohohoh) x4
But we rock the party that rocks the body while everybody has gone away.
We rock the party that rocks the body today.
But we rock the party that rocks the body when there is nothing left to say.
We rock the party that rocks the body today.
We would have lit a fire if we could.
But we just turned down the light and forgot it all tonight.
We stopped the dreaming like we should.
We put ourselves to the test, to be just like the rest.
But we rock the party that rocks the body while everybody has gone away.
We rock the party that rocks the body today.
But we rock the party that rocks the body when there is nothing left to say.
We rock the party that rocks the body today.
Woooaahh! we rock the party that rocks the body while everybody has gone away.
We rock the party that rocks the body today.
and if you think that that you were mistaken, I guess it would be okay.
We rock the party that rocks the body today.
