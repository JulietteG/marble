Old man sittin' by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky

Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Blind  man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you you can really understand

Red lights crashing through the window in the lane
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone...

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
and you will come around

Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
and you will come around---Lyrics submitted by mellipeep.
