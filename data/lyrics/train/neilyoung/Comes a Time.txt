Comes a time when you're drifting
Comes a time when you settle down
Comes a life, feelings lifting
Lift that baby right up off the ground

Oh, this old world keeps spinning 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time

You and I, we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right, we were giving
That's how we kept what we gave away---Lyrics submitted by John.
