Working all week can make a grown man cry.
But nobody's sad on a Saturday night.
So throw some cheap sunglasses on your blood shot eye's
Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night.

[Chorus:]
Some Johny Cougar, some southern comfort
Winner's and loser's we got each other
The world looks better in neon lights
Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night.

Tell me your story and I'll tell you mine
Nobody's sad on a Saturday night.
I'll leave out the part where she said Good Bye
Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night.
It goes whoah whoah here we go rock&roll; rodeo

[Chorus]

It goes whoah whoah here we go rock&roll; rodeo
Some Johny Cougar some southern comfort
Winners or looser's we got each other
The world looks better in neon lights
Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night.

Some Hank Jr. some southern comfort
I see you dancing babe I got your number
The world looks better in neon lights
Cause nobody's sad on a Saturday night

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Leila Graham.
