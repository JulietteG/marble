I was born on the cold side of the mountain
I wanna wake up on the warm side of the bed
How I start here
And how I end there
That is the part I ain't worked out yet
Every day I climb a little bit higher
Every night I learn something new
I'm writing it down
In case I forget
One day it'll be my story for you

CHORUS
On every page you will know how much I love you
In every line you will see how much I care
With every word we will grow a little closer
Even though we both know I can't be there
That's why I'm writing it down down and down down down
Ohhhhhhhh I'm writing it down
For you and for me
And the whole wide world to read
Ohhhhhhhh writing it down
All my life I've been hoping and praying
For my time to finally arrive
To put down this pen
To say it's the end
And wake up back home with you by my side

REPEAT CHORUS

How I start here
And how I end there
That is the part I ain't worked out yet---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
