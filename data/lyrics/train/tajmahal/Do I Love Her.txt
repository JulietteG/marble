Do I love her? Yes I love her, and she love me and I hope she will
Do I love her? Yes I love her, and she love me and she love me still
She got me jumping like a Jack on a Jenny
High behind the hill.
Do I need you? Yes I need you, Honey I told you so.
Do I want you? Yes I want you, Honey want to let you know.
Now you make me higher
Deep down in my soul

Well,
When I love you, Yes I love you, Gonna give you praise.
Yes I love you, Whoa I love you , And I wont be afraid
Cause my arms theyre around you
Baby, every day.

Over mountain, over valley, over hill and dale,
Over ocean, big blue ocean, I will sail.
Im gonna be your love man like a gator baby, Im gonna drag my tail.
Wave your Jack of Diamonds when you rob my pocket of silver & gold.
Jack of Diamonds, oh you rob my pocket of silver & gold.
I ahhhh just had to let it, let it go.

(Harmonica instrumental break)

Muddy Waters, No kidding Muddy Waters gone to his grave.
Muddy Waters, Muddy Waters gone to the great big
Blues in Chicago  ??? about to be your ???
Awwwww
Whoa Oooo oooh
whoa ooo oooo oooh

Yeah Do I love her? Yes I love her, baby and I always will.
Do I need her? Yes I need her, baby and I need her still.
She got me going like a Jack on a Jenny
Baby, high behind the hill.

Smoke that harmonica. ---
