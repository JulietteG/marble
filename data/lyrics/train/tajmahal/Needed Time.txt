Jesus won't you stay by here
Oh Jesus won't you come by here
Jesus won't you come by here
Stay her if you don't stay long
Oh stay even if you don't stay long
Jesus won't you come by here

Oh now even needy time
Oh now even needy time
Now I hear a needy time
Well now is a needy time
Oh now it is a needy time

Jesus ...won't you...stay by here.....---Lyrics submitted by Edd Bean.
