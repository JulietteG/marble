If I had a mind too
I wouldn't want to be like you
And if I had time to
I wouldn't want to talk to you, Oh Oh
I don't care,  what you do
I wouldn't want to be like you,   yea

If I was high class
I wouldn't need a buck to pass
And if I was border line
I wouldn't need no alibi
I don't care what you do
I wouldn't want to be like you
     No,   no   oh

Back on the bottom line
Sinkin' for a lousy dime
And if I hit a mother load
I'd cover up anything I showed
  Oh  oo  oh
I don't care what you do
I wouldn't want to be like you

Oh oo oh
I don't care what you do I wouldn't wanna
I wouldn't want to be like you
I wouldn't want to be like you
    yea      oh     yea          oh


                                    From the L.P., "I Robot", 1977 by The Alan Parsons Project
