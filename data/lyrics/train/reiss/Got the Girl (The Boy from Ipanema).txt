Saint Marks on a rainy Saturday, I walked down to Yafo cafe
I had a latte....and there she was fine like summertime sunshine
Shining like the first time sublime, like a cool breeze on a tropical island
just island meanwhilen back in the ranch we can boombayee and dance
We can fall into a trance, and it can be your world......

If you will be my girl
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)

No more syllables of hipster parables
Im here to make your world so full to satisfy our minds 
We intellecutalize add your point emotion is irrationalise
the clouds that move and the time changing his face, lets live this place

Come one and be my girl
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)

Im so deep Im shallow, So heavy that I am hollow
Ive thought about it much too long
And it would be such a turn on to turn out and burn on 
until we get there or therell be times 
when you dont even see me and incredibly 
you free me opening my world to a new high

Now I am dreaming in colour all the time
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
I got the girl (hes got the girl)
