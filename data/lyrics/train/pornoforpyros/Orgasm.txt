Met a girl, Never had an orgasm
I believe she'd never had one

just sit back and let yourself relax

you look so good
so good 
you're so good
so good
you look so good to me
so good to me

She thought that I
was just the one
She said I know
that you can do it

She had to know
Got curious
What it was like 
Enough to trust me

You look so good
so good
you're so good
so good
you look so good to me
so good to me

You look so good
so good
you're so good
so good
you look so good to me
so good to me---Lyrics submitted by Veronica.
