Sailing away on an old chliche
Lost in the haze of a vague conversation
Gazing into the eye of your storm
The watery grave of your strange imagination

(Chorus)
Holding my breath 'til I turn blue
I've sunk to the bottom of you
I'm under your thumb you know
Wasting tears on undertows

Going around like a boat with one oar
Washed up on the shore like a man overboard
Throwing wishes into a bottomless well, well
Now the tide has changed time to catch a farewell wave

(Chorus)

Woke up brushed my teeth
Made some tea turned on the TV
Nothing to see
Crawled back to bed 'cuz of something you said
You're like a song stuck in my head---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
