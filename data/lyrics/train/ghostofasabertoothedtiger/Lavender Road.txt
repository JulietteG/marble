Where does the time go
Down Lavender Road
Turn left at the post
Where memories grow
Like weeds in summer snow
And firefly galaxies glow

(Chorus)
Here we go
Pulling up the curtains on the magic show
Heroes and ghosts sit in the front row
Curious ballerina bones and tight rope vertigo
Opera glasses like telescopes

Where does young love go
Down Lavender Road
Pebbles and planets know
How there is no hope when 
That red wind blows and
All our words go up in smoke

(Chorus)

And silence echoes
Down Lavender Road
Where wine and teardrops flow
And rows of graveyards grow alike
White rabbit holes and
Where they stop nobody knows

Curiosity killed the cat
Vanity killed the man

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
