Rainbows in gasoline golden and green
Chemical sun setting
Like a hundred million chameleon clouds
We are the dinosaurs now

(Chorus)
Wearing Freudian slips like evening gowns
Taking guilt trips from town to town
Dressed for excess
Wearing cheap pursuits
Walking around in another man's shoes

Why do we give memories eyes and teeth
Like taxidermy dreams
Bury them in gardens under the weeds
Let the willows weep

(Chorus)

What will you do
When the moon comes tumbling down

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
