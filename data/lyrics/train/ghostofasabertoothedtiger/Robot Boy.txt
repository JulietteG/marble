On the first day it started to rain
Children were laughing and went out to play
But soon all the streets were rivers and streams
Creatures were trickling in from the deep
Cars floating like ships over skyscraper tips
The tallest of trees swaying like seaweed

(Chorus)
Aluminum and paperclips
Refrigerator parts and microchips
A rudimentary robot boy
A heart of rubber bands and plastic toys

Just before dusk afraid he might rust
He climbed aboard an upside down bus
With bottle cap eyes he soon realized
That nobody else but he has survived
Sifting through debris of kindred machines
Drifting through a graveyard of sunken cities

(Chorus)

For thirty nights with no land in sight
He never was hungry nor lonesome or tired
His mechanical brain could not go insane
His metallic skin could never feel pain
The whales gathered round with sibilant sound
If you want to survive if you want to shine
Then you've got to find someone of your kind
As they pulled him away across the waves
He saw a pretty face
Made of tin cans and lace

Aluminum and balloon lips
Refrigerator parts and cardboard hips
A rudimentary robot girl
A heart of rubber bands
And plastic pearls---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra.
