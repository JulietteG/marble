Finally
From all I want to see
Remove

From the place that I love
The place that I touch
That moves me

Their eyes are on me
They're running for me
Remove

Moronic world
I can't hold on

Silently
They take identity
Remove

They take the colours from me
And mould the others on me
Remove

They take the hurt from me
They take the worth of me
Remove

Moronic world
I can't hold on

Moronic world
I can't hold on
No, I can't hold on
I can't hold on
No, I can't hold on---
