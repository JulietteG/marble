Get out 
Get out
Cos I dont know what youre about

Get out 
Get out
Cos I dont know what youre thinking about
Something says leave
Just leave
Cos I dont like you looking at me

I dont want you here
I dont want you near
Cos your face just gives me the fear

Blow out
Blow out
Cos I dont believe youre who you are
And who you said to me

No youre out
Get out
I dont wanna know what your about

Get out (Repeat x 8)

Out the door
Out the door
Youve become an intolerable bore
Disappear
Disappear
Before your voice it brings me to tears

Dont want you here
Dont want you near
Cos I think youre fucking weird

Blow out
Blow out
I cant stand to see your face
I wish youd go some other place
Get out 
Get out
I dont want you hanging about

Get out (Repeat x 10)---
