I don't like your space
I don't like your hate
When you direct your smile
It just burns a hole in me

When I feel you burn
See you turn
Don't turn your hate on me
Turn that hate on me
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Don't turn that hate on me
Break me free
I'm sure about
Things going down

Don't turn your hate on me
Don't turn your hate on me
Don't turn your hate on me---
