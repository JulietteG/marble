Friend youre bringing me down
Friend theres so much around
Try communicating
Dont anticipate
Cos I want to run with you
Cos I want to run with you
Cos I want to run with you
And maybe then we can walk together

Friend youre getting paranoid
Friend youre becoming soul destroyed 
They all laugh at you
Theyre all dismissing you
And I want to run with you
And I want to run with you
And I want to run with you
And maybe then we can walk together

Cos I want to see you in no pain this time
Cos I want to see you shine 
Blind me, blind me, blind me
Cos I wanna run with you
Cos I wanna run with you
Cos I wanna run with you
Maybe then we can walk together
Together
Together
Together
Together

Im coming to drag you out
To drag you out
And we can walk together
And we can walk together
And we can walk together
Together
Together---
