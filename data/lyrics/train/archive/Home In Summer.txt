Heal down to me
I've rested with you
I've spend always time
Time with my brothers
Love for my sister
Now I'm fine
And I wanna come home
These been some tears
Many fears about the way
The way that you love
The pain when you're bad
It makes me sad
Totally mad
Now I need to come back home
How beautiful
So wonderful
A beautiful love
Friends 'til the end
Now I'm home
Sweet home---
