The unassailable leading me down the wide path
I consider the scale the whole aftermath
From the land I sketch a grand design
A being in time
Message the floodlight will shine
Divine skies will open
Open road chosen pausing in time frozen
Best left unspoken
About the life settling down
Steadily lowered into the ground the sound is quite deafening
Confounded regiments getting hounded out
Never better the fallout of the sidesplitter
Rise of the switch-hitter
Watch as he grows bitter
Foreseeable futures they be selling him down the river
Purified and maybe when we refine and say
You'll be hearing him coming from half a mile away
Contemplation still thinking it over onward we soldier clearer than present danger
Us we as a planet handing arms to the generations down the line what is left behind?

Conscience cannot carry the weight of consequence
Says a voice who then utters a vote of confidence
See the level of minerals going down to ground zero
Nothing can be stopping declines cycle
Wheels turn the sucking it dry desert
But the oceans wave is on the rise in front of your eyes
Paralysed you're rooted into the spot
You can't move the rot is setting in at a rate of knots
So far from the truth
Unavoidable proof revelations will raise the roof

The revolutions will be televised to sensationalise and destabilise
I'm wide eyed aware and wiser to the scandal
It is too much for one man to handle
Stand together we might stand a hope in hells chance or else a threatening fate waits---
