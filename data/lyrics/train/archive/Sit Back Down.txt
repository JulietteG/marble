They try hard to keep in time
They're not you
Sit back down
Sit back down
Take it in
They exist
Keep it slow
Keep it fixed
Sit back down
Sit back down
City streets are synchronized
Human forms
All petrified
So sit back down
Sit back down
Sit back down
Sit back down

Don't look up
Let them sleep
Don't disturb
The morbid feet
You're not the one
Don't you dare
Sit back down
Sit back down
Eyes are drained
Streets are pained
Stay below
Keep it slow
Sit back down
Sit back down
Just sit back down
Sit back down

Close your eyes you sleepers on the street
Walking dead
Walking dead

Sit back down, sit back down
Sit back down, sit back down

Walking dead---
