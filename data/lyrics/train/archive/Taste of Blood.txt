I get a taste of blood in my mouth when you're near
A feeling that's too painful to bear

I get a taste of blood in my mouth when you're near
A feeling that's too painful to bear

Straight to my head

I get a look of fear on my face with you here
A feeling that shivers down my skin

Try to resist, but it's just not finished with you yet
A hold too intense to forget---Lyrics submitted by hamidreza osanl.
