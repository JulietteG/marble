Find answers on the street
In cracks between my feet
But I can't see

Try so hard in vain
To wipe away the stain
Of everyday pain

And you never see me walking towards you
If you did I would surely fade
And you never feel me trying to hold you
If you did I would surely fade away

With the wounded in my way
There's so much to say
But not today

I wonder if it will turn
Not fall apart and burn
When will I learn

And you never see me walking towards you
If you did I would surely fade

And you never feel me trying to hold you
If you did I would surely fade away---
