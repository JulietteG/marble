There's no need to fear me
Darling, I love you as you are when you're alone
I'll never try to change you
As if I could, and if I were to, what's the part that I'd miss most?
When you're smiling and astride me
I can hardly believe I've found you and I'm terrified by that

I've got nothing to hide from you
Kissing my brother in my dreams or finding God knows in my dreams
You see me as I am, it's true
Aimless, fake drifter, and the horny manchild models for to boot
That's how you live free
Truly see and be seen---
