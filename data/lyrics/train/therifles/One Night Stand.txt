She has a face to die for, but nothing going on inside
She'll never make your eyes sore, until she starts to speak her mind
So I'll just try to keep the conversation light
Then in the morning at the door I'm sure we'll kiss goodbye.

Nothing wrong with that, it's only one night and nothing else
Every time I tell myself it's the last time
One day I'll comply, just not tonight!

Now I'm not ignorant, but some things tend to slip my mind
Like where she bought her tan from, or the colour of the hair she dyes
Now I'm not being mean infact I'm really quite polite
All I'm trying to say is that you won't catch her on Mastermind

Nothing wrong with that, it's only one night and nothing else
Every time I tell myself it's the last time
One day I'll respire, just not tonight!

Nothing wrong with that, it's only one night and nothing else
Every time I tell myself it's the last time

Nothing wrong with that, it's only one night and nothing else
Every time I tell myself it's the last time
One day I'll retire, 

Oh! what a liar!, just not tonight!---Lyrics submitted by calum.
