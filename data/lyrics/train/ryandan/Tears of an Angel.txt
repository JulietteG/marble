Cover my eyes
Cover my ears
Tell me these words are a lie
It cant be true
That I'm losing you
The sun cannot fall from the sky

Can you hear heaven cry
Tears of an angel
Tears of angel.
Tears of an angel
Tears of an angel.

Stop every clock
Stars are in shock
The river will run to the sea
I wont let you fly
I wont say goodbye
I wont let you slip away from me

Can you hear heaven cry
Tears of an angel
Tears of angel.
Tears of an angel
Tears of an angel.


So hold on
Be strong
Everyday hope will grow
I'm here, dont you fear

Little one dont let go
(ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh)
Dont let go
(ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh)
Dont let go
(ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh)

Cover my eyes
Cover my ears
Tell me these words are a lie---Lyrics submitted by alejandra.
