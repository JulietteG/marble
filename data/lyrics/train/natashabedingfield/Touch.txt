I was tryin to cross the street
When I tripped and spilled my coffee
On a man who yelled at me
And then walked off in a hurry
Now hes gonna be late for work
So he called his secretary
Said to cancel his appointment with the guy in the lobby

Whos been waiting for a while
And talking on the phone
Got invited to a party and thought he couldnt go
But hes here right now
Standing in my house
And someone turns the music loud

So we dance
And we laugh
And we touch (touch touch)

Yeah we dance
And we laugh
And we touch (touch touch)

Gonna party all night till the sun comes up
Cuz it feels like the world disappears around us

When we dance
When we laugh
When we touch

I was planning out my party
Running errands round the city
Grocery bags full of alcohol
And chocolate chip cookies
Saw a dress that was amazing
In the window of a boutique
So I went across the street
Then my heel broke and it threw me
I tried to catch my balance
But I was supposed to fall
It seems that spilling coffee
Was no accident at all
Cuz youre here right now
Sitting on my couch
Funny how it all works out

So we dance
And we laugh
And we touch (touch touch)

Yeah we dance
And we laugh
And we touch (touch touch)

Gonna party all night till the sun comes up
Cuz it feels like the world disappears around us

When we dance
When we laugh
When we touch

Every choice we make
And every road we take
Every interaction
Starts a chain reaction
Were both affected
When we least expect it
And then when we touched
And it all connected
Every choice we make
And every road we take
Every interaction
Starts a chain reaction
Were both affected when we least expect it
And then when we

When we dance
And we laugh
And we touch (touch touch)

Yeah we dance
And we laugh
And we touch (touch touch)

Gonna party all night till the sun comes up
Cuz it feels like the world disappears around us

When we dance
When we laugh
When we touch

Ooo oo oo ooo
We touch

Ooo oo oo ooo
We touch

Ooo oo oo ooo
We touch

Ooo oo oo ooo
