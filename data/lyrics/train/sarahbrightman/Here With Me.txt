I didn't hear you leave.
I wonder how am I still here
I don't want move a thing
It might change my memory.

Oh I am what I am 
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

I won't go 
I won't sleep
I can't breath
Until you're resting
Here with me
I won't leave
I can't hide
I cannot be

Until you're resting 
Here with me

I don't want to call my friends
They might wake me 
From this dream
And I don't want to leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been

Oh I am what I am 
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

I won't go
I won't sleep
I can't breath
Until you're resting
Here with me
I won't leave
I can't hide
I cannot be

Until you're resting
Here with me---Lyrics submitted by Ethy.
