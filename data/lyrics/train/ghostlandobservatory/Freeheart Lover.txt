Ive been staying up all night
Ive been all losing my mind
Ive been searching all the world
But i aint found you

Ive been walking on the line
Ive been spending all my time
Ive been singing all your songs
But you dont hear me

[Chorus]
My freeheart lover
My freeheart lover
My freeheart lover
Well dont play games with me

Ive been living way to long
Ive been learning right from wrong
Ive been putting on my vibe
but you dont feel me

Ive been giving all i got
Ive been putting up with fire
Ive been giving everything
But i aint got you

[Chorus]
My freeheart lover
My freeheart lover
My freeheart lover
Well dont play games with me
