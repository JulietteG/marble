Everybody sees me,
But it's not that easy,
Standing in the light field,
Standing in the light field.
Waiting for some action,
Waiting for some action
Oh but why won't you come over here?

Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love.
Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love.

Old time grudges
Will die so slowly
I know you miss the
way I saw you.

You're cold,
You're so cold,
You're so cold,
You're so cold.

Nobody could see me,
everything's too easy,
standing in the light field,
standing in the light field.
Waiting for some actress, 
waiting for some actress to say
why won't you come over here?

Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love.
Why won't you come over here?
We've got a city to love.

Old time love song
Will die so swiftly
You never trust me
For a while it was nice
but it's time to say bye

You're Cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

No, no, no, cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

Oh, no, no, no, no, cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

Oh, you're so cold!---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
