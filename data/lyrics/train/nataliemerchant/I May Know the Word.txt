I may the know the word but not say it
I may know the truth but not face it
I may hear the sound whisper, sacred and profound
But turn my head... indifferent.

I may know the word but not say it
I may love the food but not taste it
I may know the way to comfort and to sear the worried ways
But fold my hands... indifferent.

If I'm on my knees I'm begging now
If I'm on my knees groping in the dark
I'd be praying for deliverance
From the night in... into the day.
But its all fading
Its all grating 
But its all gray to me.

I may know the word but not say it
This might be the time but I might waste it
Tho' this may be the hour
Something move me
Someone prove me wrong
Before night comes with indifference.

If I'm on my knees, I'm begging now
If i'm on my knees groping in the dark
I'd be praying for deliverence
From the night until the day

If I'm on my knees, I'm begging now
If i'm on my knees groping in the dark
I'd be praying for deliverence
From the night in to the day
But its all fading
Its all grating 
But its all gray to me.

I recognize the walls inside
I recognize them all
I face between them chasing me
Until they fall
