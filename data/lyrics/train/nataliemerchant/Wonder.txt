Doctors have come from distant cities - just to see me
They stand over my bed - disbelieving, what they see


     They say, "I must be one of the wonders
     Of God's own creation."
     And they smile as they see they can't offer
     No explanation.

     O-o-o-o-oh, I believe
     Fate smiled at destiny.
     Laughed, as she came to my cradle,
       "No, this child will be able."
     Laughed, as my body she lifted,
       "No, this child will be gifted."
     Laughed as she came to my mother
       "No, this child will not suffer."
     Paid a lot with patience & with pain.
     She'll make her way...
     She'll make her way...

Newspapers ask in to my questions - my confessions
They reach into my head to steal the glory, of my story.

    They say,"....

People see me - I'm a challenge, to their balance
I'm over your head now - I confound you & astound you.. 

    They say," ...---Lyrics submitted by JubiLee.
