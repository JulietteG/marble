Lonely here
It hurts tonight
Fills my face without delight
I'm gonna pace until i die
I don't know how to feel alright

Waited for you all night
You didn't come
Feels like i
Gonna give up again
Feels like i'm my only friend

It pulls me out
From the outside in
Tell me i'm not the only one

I've seen you smile a million times

Lonely here
Still hurts tonight
Face my fears
Throughout the night

I'm gonna play?
Until i die
Drown inside
And wonder why

I wanted you to hold me up
That made hard?
To ease you up

There's tricks to know
That i didn't know
The love was gone
So i let her go

I've seen you smile a million times
A million times
A million times---Lyrics submitted by Trey Smit.
