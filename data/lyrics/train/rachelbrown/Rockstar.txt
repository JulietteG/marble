I got this funny little feeling 
That I'm, about to lose my cool when 
you're here, everything starts spinning 
I'm drunk without even drinking 

And I've got this tiny little secret 
I think it's best that I just keep it 
Locked up hidden in my pocket 
You found the key, guess I'd better spill it 

Feels like I'm slipping on a slide 
Roller coaster ride 
Hands held high! 
Can't escape 
But maybe I'll feel alive 
This is right 
I got you by my side 

My heart is beating like a kick drum 
Your love is what's keeping the rhythm 
Don't stop 
Keep playing like a rock star 

My hand keeps crashing like a cymbal 
Once again muddled up and tangled 
Don't stop 
Keep playing like a rock star 

Doo doo doo doo doo 

Uh oh You've become a problem 
But I don't think I wanna solve you 
You're the reason I'm so restless 
You're my strength and you're my weakness 

I'm cool just sitting here waiting 
For you, I could spend all day and 
Be fine I'd feel like I've wasted any time 
That's why you amaze me 

Feels like I'm slipping on a slide 
Roller coaster ride 
Hands held high! 
Can't escape 
But maybe I'll feel alive 
This is right 
I got you by my side 

My heart is beating like a kick drum 
Your love is what's keeping the rhythm 
Don't stop 
Keep playing like a rock star 

My hand keeps crashing like a cymbal 
Once again muddled up and tangled 
Don't stop 
Keep playing like a rock star 

Doo doo doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo doo 
Doo doo doo doo doo 

Doo doo doo doo 

My heart is beating like a kick drum 
Your love is what's keeping the rhythm 
Don't stop 
Keep playing like a rock star 
Doo doo doo doo 

My hand keeps crashing like a cymbal 
Once again muddled up and tangled 
Don't stop 
Keep playing like a rock star
