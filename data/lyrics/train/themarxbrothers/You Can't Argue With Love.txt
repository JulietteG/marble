He was a guy with that fire in his eye.
And I passed out as he passed by.
Couldn't resist him.
Didn't even try.
Cause you can't argue with love.

He was the kind that could love and forget.
I knew that love would just lead to regret.
But I was his victim the minute we met.
Cause you can't argue with love.


I knew he wasn't good for me.
I knew it right from the start.
But his ways were mighty pleasin'.
So how're you gonna reason with your heart.


Sometimes I think I hear him knockin' at my door.
And I wanna tell him 
You don't live here no more.
But I'll take him back just the way I've done before.
Cause you can't, you can't argue with love---Lyrics submitted by Claire.
