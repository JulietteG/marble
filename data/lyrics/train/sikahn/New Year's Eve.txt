I've seen you toss and restless between the night and day
Paying back the debts of many years
Or staring out the window til the mist has burned away
And waiting for the sun to dry your tears.

I've seen you young
I've seen you old
And I've seen you lost and found
I've seen you sit and cry without a sound

And I've seen you in the lamplight with the hard lines in your face
And the shadows of your fears upon the wall
But crying ain't no weakness
And to lose is no disgrace
You see we're not so different after all.

But can't you tell by the ringing bell that the old year's moving on
I'd like to say one thing before it's gone

May every house you live in have flowers by your door
And children in the bed to keep you warm
May the people there accept you for what you really are
And help you find some shelter in the storm.
And morning rain to ease the pain that comes with being free
May the new year bring you freedom peacefully.---Lyrics submitted by Debra.
