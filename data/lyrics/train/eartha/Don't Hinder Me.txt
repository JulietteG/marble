I suppose Id better let you know 
I feel something stirring in my soul
I know Im sitting here all composed 
But youd better know when the Holy Ghost shows
Im liable to hit the floor

When I think about the wonders Hes performed in my life
I could break down and cry 
So when I wave my hands you may not understand
That Ive been through a circumstance
And Ive got a praise in advance

I dont know about you or what youve come to do
But please dont hinder me
I dont mind your company 
If youve got praise for the King
Lets get together and send it up

And I suppose Id better let you know 
Im filled with the Holy Ghost
Im a tongue talking Holy Roller
And if thats just too much for you 
Id better be the one to break the news
Im a hand clapping, foot stomper

When I think about the wonders Hes performed in my life
I could break down and cry at almost anytime
So when I wave my hands you may not understand
That Ive been through a circumstance
Got a praise in advance

I dont know about you or what youve come to do
But please dont hinder me
I dont mind your company 
If youve got praise for the King
Lets get together and send it up

I suppose Id better let you know 
I feel something stirring in my soul
I know Im sitting here all composed 
But youd better know when the Holy Ghost shows
Im liable to hit the floor

When I think about the wonders Hes performed in my life
I could break down and cry at almost anytime
So when I wave my hands you may not understand
That Ive been through a circumstance
I got a praise in advance

I dont know about you or what youve come to do
But please dont hinder me
I dont mind your company 
If youve got praise for the King
Lets get together and send it up

And I suppose Id better let you know

Im a tongue talking Holy Roller
If thats just too much for you

I dont know about you or what youve come to do
But please dont hinder me
I dont mind your company 
If youve got praise for the King
Lets get together and send it up

Send it up. Send it on up 
Send it up. Send it on up 
Send it up. Send it on up 
Send it up. Send it on up 

I dont know about you or what youve come to do
But please dont hinder me
I dont mind your company 
If youve got praise for the King
Lets get together and send it up

Send it up. Send it on up 
Send it up. Send it on up 
Send it up. Send it on up 
Send it up. Send it on up 

I dont know about you or what youve come to do
But please dont hinder me
I dont mind your company 
If youve got praise for the King
Lets get together and send it up---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
