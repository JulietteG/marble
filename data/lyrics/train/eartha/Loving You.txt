With all my heart Im loving you, youre loving me too
Yes this is true.  Yes its true
All that we do is between me and you
Ill keep loving you

And everyday Im trusting you for all that you do
Yes this is true.  Yes its true
All that you say between us will stay
Youll be with me always

There is a tie that binds so strong that I cant let it go
There is a love so strong it keeps me holding on

I believe you always knew that I cant live without you
Yes this is true. Yes its true
Id toss in my sleep, cry endlessly
If you couldnt be with me

Its beyond me to repay you, I will serenade you
Yes this is true. Yes its true
This songs for you.  It belongs to you
Ill be loving you

There is a tie that binds so strong that I cant let it go
There is a love so strong it keeps me holding on

Love divine, Love divine. 
I am yours. You are mine.
Forever more. For a lifetime
Ill be loving you. Loving you

There is a tie that binds so strong that I cant let it go
There is a love so strong it keeps me holding on

With all my heart Im loving you, youre loving me too
Yes this is true.  Yes its true
All that we do is between me and you
Ill keep loving you---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
