I know you aint seen me lately
I bet you thought you drove me crazy
The last time you saw me I ran for cover
And you assumed it was all over

Im still standing, Im still standing yeah
Im still standing, I aint going no where

I know you thought you saw the end of me
But God, He just would not let it be
Intervening before the attack
(He) refused to let me go down like that

Im still standing; hit me with your best shot 
Im still standing 
Im still standing, all you got
Im still standing 

Im still standing; hit me with your best shot 
I aint going no where, I aint going no where
I aint going no where, all you got

I know you dont wanna hear my voice
Im sure you didnt expect to see me no more
I remind you of how cruel you be
I never gave you a reason to rail on me

Im still standing, Im still standing yeah
Im still standing; I know you didnt wanna see me no more
Im still standing, Im still standing
I aint going no where, I aint going no where

Theres one (up) above whos Almighty
(He) kick me down with all the strength I need
So do what you want to do to try and work me
Nothing you can do to harm me

Im still standing; hit me with your best shot 
Im still standing, all you got
I know you didnt wanna see me no more
Im still standing; hit me with your best shot 
I aint going no where
I aint going no where, all you got

Pressure made me go the round 
And it almost took me down
Making move I didnt plan
Throwing blows I couldnt land
But I had to hold my frame
Got some strength when I heard my name
Focused on what really counts
At the end I stand my ground

Im still standing, Im still standing
Got all the strength I need 
Im still standing, yeah yeah
Im still standing, I aint going no where

Pressure made me go the round 
And it almost took me down
Making move I didnt plan
Throwing blows I couldnt land
But I had to hold my frame
Got some strength when I heard my name
Focused on what really counts
At the end I stand my ground
Im still standing

Im still standing; hit me with your best shot 
Here I am, Im still standing
Im still standing, all you got
I know you dont wanna see me
Im still standing; hit me with your best shot
I aint going no where, I aint going no where

I know you thought you saw the end of me
Im still standing; hit me with your best shot
I know you didnt wanna see me know more
Im still standing, all you got
I aint going no where

Im still standing; hit me with your best shot
I aint going no where, I aint going no where
I aint going no where, all you got---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
