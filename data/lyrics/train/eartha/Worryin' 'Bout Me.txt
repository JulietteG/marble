Aint no sense in worryin bout me;
Aint no sense in worryin bout me;
What if I vanish tomorrow?
Life still goes on without me

Aint no sense in crying over me;
I lived to be all I knew to be
Just keep my words that you borrowed;
Publish them for the whole world to see

What I do with my time
Is work on me, Its my life
Gotta be sure that Im right;
Cross my Ts and dot my Is

And if I miss dont be confused
Im not a hypocrite.   That aint cool
Youve got an optimist in the room
And all Im trying to do is tell you

Aint no sense in worryin bout me;
Aint no sense in worryin bout me;
What if I vanish tomorrow?
Life still goes on without me

We cannot suspend a prophecy;
My friend what will be, it sure will be (que sera sera)
If Babylon falls tomorrow,
Then thats how it was supposed to be

Cant control every circumstance
Some things are out of your hands
Youve got to believe theres a bigger plan
Or youll make yourself a madman

Take the coast, walk the shoreline,
Search your soul, free your mind
Try to be right in all you do
Cause only you can account for you

Aint no sense in worryin bout me;
Aint no sense in worryin bout me;
What if I vanish tomorrow?
Life still goes on without me

We cannot suspend a prophecy;
My friend what will be, it sure will be (que sera sera)
If Babylon falls tomorrow,
Then thats how it was supposed to be

Aint no sense in crying over me;
I lived to be all I knew to be
Just keep my words that you borrowed;
Publish them for the whole world to see

Aint no sense in worryin bout me; (Aint no sense in crying over me)
Aint no sense in worryin bout me;
What if I vanish tomorrow?
Life still goes on without me---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
