Im a simple girl who loves simple things
I have hopes and I have dreams
But what would they mean
If you were not here with me

I aint trying to be nobodys superstar (superstar)
Lord I wanna be right where you are
Tomorrow if youd take it all away
Id still be loving you anyway (Still be loving you anyway)

Oh I love these simple things
Because Im just a simple girl
Oh I love these simple things
Because Im just a simple girl

It aint like I aint never been there before (there before)
When there was no open door
And I thanked you all the more
That is what you made me for

I still love the beach and the sounds of waves
I love the park and the trees of shade
Its the way you cover me
From the heat of the day (You find a way to cover me, cover me)

Oh I love these simple things
Because Im just a simple girl
Oh I love these simple things
Because Im just a simple girl---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
