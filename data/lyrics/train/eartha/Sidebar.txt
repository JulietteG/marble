Take me off to the side
Speak to me in the night
And my soul will be silent
For your direction and your guidance
(Ill) leave the noisy world behind me
In solitude you will find me
Release the stuff inside me
Loose the chains that try to bind me

You know be better than anyone
Aint got no facades, here I come
You know the things that Ive said and done
I have no excuses. No not one
Take me out of the spot; 
If I aint ready for my lot
You know if I can handle it or not; 
Or if I need a Sidebar

This may be so apropos
If I holla please dont let me go
You know what I do not know
Give me a sidebar to the letter
It might make me cry but Ill be better

Take me down to the sea;
Ill hold my breath and then Ill count to three
After immersion maybe we can tea;
And talk about all that is not right with me

You read me just like an open book
You dont even have to take a look
All those things I misunderstood
Work together for my higher good

I should have been on the silver screen
Tragedy was a daily scene
Wont you put me on quarantine,
Or you can roll me up in a magazine

Tell the press be advised
I wont be wearing no disguise
Truth reflected in my eyes
Im tryna access paradise

This may be so apropos
If I holla please dont let me go
You know what I do not know
Your Honor, give me a sidebar to the letter
It might make me cry but Ill be better

Take me off to the side
Speak to me in the night
And my soul will be silent
For your direction and your guidance
(Ill) leave the noisy world behind me
In solitude you will find me
Release the stuff inside me
Loose the chains that try to bind me

You know be better than anyone
Aint got no facades, here I come
You know the things that Ive said and done
I have no excuses. No not one
Take me out of the spot; 
If I aint ready for my lot
You know if I can handle it or not; 
Or if I need a Sidebar

Your Honor, give me a sidebar to the letter
It might make me cry but Ill be better

Take me off to the side---Lyrics submitted by Lock.
