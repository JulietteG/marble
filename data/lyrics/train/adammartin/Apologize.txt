[Verse 1]
I'm holdin' on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground.
And I'm hearin' what you say,
But I just can't make a sound.
You tell me that you need me,
Then you go and cut me down...
But wait...
You tell me that you're sorry,
Didn't think I'd turn around...
And say...

[Chorus]
That it's too late to apologize.
It's too late...
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
I'd take another chance,
Take a fall, take a shot for you.
I need you like a heart needs a beat,
But it's nothin' new, yeah!
I loved you with a fire red,
Now it's turnin' blue...
And you say...
Sorry, like an angel
Heaven let me think was you...
But I'm afraid...

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
Whoa!

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.

I said it's too late to apologize, yeah!
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah!
I'm holdin' on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground. ---
