Well Im so above you
And its plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out
And I dont mind bleeding
Any old time you keep me waiting
Waiting, waiting

Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting

Well your mama kept you but your daddy left you
And I shouldve done you just the same
But I came to love you
Am I born to bleed?
Any old time you keep me waiting
Waiting, waiting

Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting

Hey!

Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Oh, oh-oh I got a love that keeps me waiting---
