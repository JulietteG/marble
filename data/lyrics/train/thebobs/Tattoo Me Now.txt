Im not the prisoner of my skin
Its flexible and paper thin
Im breaking out to let you in
Where I get pierced with a little pin

Little pricks I could hardly feel  tiny little needles made of steel
I make a statement, hear my cry  something Ill have past the day that I die
I was inspired by the illustrated man  I got my first butterfly on my can
Im running out of room I cant find a place  Ill have to put the Last Supper on my face

Tattoo, tattoo me now tattoo ow

I cant be buried in a Jewish cemetery  unless before I die I become very hairy
I cant get a job that means anything  But I can always get a nipple ring
A pattern of scars filled with ink  like vacation postcards dont you think?
Running from my ankle all the way to my breast  is a map of my vacation in the wild wild west

Tattoo, tattoo me now tattoo ow

My body is a canvas  a picture I control
A gallery of images  I worship every hole
The backs an empty album  begging for some art
Dragons, lizards, ancient gods  only question  where to start---Lyrics submitted by christine mille.
