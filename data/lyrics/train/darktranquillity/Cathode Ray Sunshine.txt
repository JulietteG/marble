Carry our streams
Lift up our less than elated lives
Transmit ourselves we breathe out
Where no one whispers

Take in all the dark light
Turn the nighttime into day
Take in all the dark light
Turn the nighttime into day

Cathode ray sunshine
Speak out and we receive
Cathode ray sunshine
Show me and let us in

Alienate
Block out all amid the breaking of the light
See it again and again
Single sight

Sensory perception
Turn the nighttime into day
Sensory perception
Turn the nighttime into day

Cathode ray sunshine
Speak out and we receive
Cathode ray sunshine
Show me and let us in

To our great distrust
Escape is a means of
Getting through alive
Take it in and spit it out again
That measly filth

Focal degradation
Bring the chaos into light
Cathode ray sunshine
Burn---Lyrics submitted by Alexander.
