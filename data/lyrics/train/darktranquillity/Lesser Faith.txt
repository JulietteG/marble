Dreampt up a new word today
In my ignorance I gave it meaning
Who was I to know
To say it is to know it
To hear it is to believe, is to believe

I dreampt the world would end
I was not wrong
To doubt, to discredit
The other words I've heard before
From inside a shell pretending

It's all you've shown your faith
And what you've always known
So lay your trust in the unthinkable
It's time to justify your lesser faith

It's all your faith has shown
And all you'll ever know
Why do you matter you're insignificant
How can you justify your lesser faith?

To know it is to fear it
To fear it is to say no, is to say no
To the blazing highs and lows
I know I'll fail
To break, to cast it down
You take your lead
Its a staff that must be broken in two

It's all your faith has shown
And all you'll ever know
Why do you matter you're insignificant
How can you justify your lesser faith?---Lyrics submitted by Alexander.
