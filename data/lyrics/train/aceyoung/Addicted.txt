(I don't know)
I gotta let it out, baby, here's my confession
My hands are shaking and it's close to obsession
This pounding in my chest been going 24/7
You'd think the pain by now would make me learn my lesson
But there's no way to win when I push you away
When I'd do anything if you asked me to stay

(Chorus)
I'm so addicted, you're everything I want
No complication - you know you had me from the jump
I'm so addicted, do what you wanna do
I'm committed, addicted to you

(I'm addicted)
It's cruel to call it love when it's lust and desire
I feel like I can fly, then you cut down the wire
And even though I know I'm sinking lower by the hour
Can't change the fact that I'm a slave to your power
And my life is a lock and you hold the key
And you tighten the chains when I try to break free

(Chorus)
I'm so addicted, you're everything I want
No complication - you know you had me from the jump
I'm so addicted, do what you wanna do
I'm committed, addicted to you

You're giving enough just to let me breathe
You keep me alive just to watch me bleed
I'd crawl down on my knees for you
You made damn sure that I don't forget
Your love's a drug I could never quit
All the things that you do, you do, you do
But there's no way to win when I push you away
When I'd do everything if you asked me to stay

(Chorus)
I'm so addicted, you're everything I want
No complication - you know you had me from the jump
I'm so addicted, do what you wanna do
I'm committed, addicted to you

I'm so addicted, you're everything I need
My medication, you're the lie that I believe
I'm so addicted, there's nothing I can do
I'm committed, addicted to you

Addicted, committed, addicted to you
Addicted, committed, addicted to you
Addicted, committed, addicted to you
Addicted, committed, addicted to you---Lyrics submitted by Annette.
