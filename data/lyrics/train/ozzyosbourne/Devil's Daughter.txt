WELL I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE, I KNOW YOU LIVE ALONE, I'LL PAY
A VISIT IN YOUR DARKEST HOUR, I'VE GOT A TREAT IN STORE, WON'T BE
THE SAME ON MORE AND I WILL DEMOSTRATE MY HOLY POWER.
I SEE THROUGH WHAT IS IT INSIDE YOU, I'LL MAKE YOU BREAKDOWN,
BREAKDOWN, BREAKDOWN AND CRY.
DEVIL'S DAUGHTER, YOU DON'T WANT A HOLY WAR. DEVIL'S
DAUGHTER, YOU DON'T WANT A HOLY WAR.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT, I'LL CAST THE DEMONS OUT AND I'LL
PERSIST UNTIL THE BATTLE'S WON. I'LL FEEL YOUR CREEPING FLESH IF
YOU'RE TO BE POSSESSED, THEN I WILL DESCRATE WHAT YOU'VE
BECOME.
I SEE THROUGH WHAT IT IS INSIDE YOU, I'LL MAKE YOU BREAKDOWN,
BREAKDOWN, BREAKDOWN AND CRY.
DEVIL'S DAUGHTER, YOU DON'T WANT A HOLY WAR. DEVIL'S
DAUGHTER, YOU DON'T WANT A HOLY WAR, DEVIL'S DAUGHTER YOU DON'T
WANT A
HOLY WAR, DEVIL'S DAUGHTER.
THE TIME HAS COME AT LAST, YOUR FUTURE DAYS HAVE PAST, NO USE
IN FIGHTING BATTLES YOU CAN'T WIN. THE FINAL CONFLICT'S LOST, YOU
CAN'T AFFORD THE COST, DON'T TRY TO EXPIATE YOUR FUTURE'S SINS.
I SEE THROUGH WHAT IS IT INSIDE YOU, I'LL MAKE YOU BREAKDOWN,
BREAKDOWN, BREAKDOWN AND CRY, BREAKDOWN, BREAKDOWN,
BREAKDOWN AND CRY.
D...D...D...DEVIL'S DAUGHTER (I'M WATCHING YOU WATCHING
YOU) D...D...D...DEVIL'S DAUGHTER (I'M WATCHING YOU WATCHING YOU)
D...D...D...DEVIL'S DAUGHTER (I'M WATCHING YOU WATCHING YOU)
DEVIL'S DAUGHTER AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAHAHAHAH!---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
