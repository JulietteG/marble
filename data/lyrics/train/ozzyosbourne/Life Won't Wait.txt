I watch it all change the news of the day and throw it away
Time will kill all the pain faith will cure the decay your home is blind ambission the weak brings us together
Stay strong stay true be brave - it comes down to you

Tried to just let it go know that justice moves slow but it comes in the end
Rise the guilty will fall stay they can't take it all they want the unimportance it's love they leave behind
Stand up stay true be hard - the future looks to you

Every second you throw away
Every minute of every day
Don't get caught in a myriad
Because life won't wait for you
No life won't wait for you my friend

I'm watching the change through who will carry the flame it all feels very strange
Dreams than mean can be good faith - to live as we should and know we're all connected we give ourselves the power
Stay strong stay true be brave - it all comes down to you

Every day that you wait you're falling faster
No sleight of hand no twist of fate no ever after
When it's gone - it's gone afight to the bitter end
Life won't wait for you
No life won't wait for you my friend

Life won't wait for you my friend
Life won't wait for you my friend
Life won't wait for you my friend
Life won't wait for you my friend---Lyrics submitted by Louise.
