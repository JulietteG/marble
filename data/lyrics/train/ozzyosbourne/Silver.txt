Your words
They go like no mare
They sale the world
High headed, yeah
I can't believe
I'm still here
I know
I should be dead, yeah

This desperation
Makes me feel so filthy
But I know
If I don't stop
I won't feel guilty
Take me higher
Pray me faster
Help me get her
Who I'm after

One time
To take away all pain
One more
To turn myself insane
One time
To keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away

There is no future waiting
There is no morning ever
I can't stop
The place is spinning

My anti drugs
Get trashed, yeah
This paranoia stops
My mind from sinking
I don't know
If I'm awake
Or if I'm dreaming

Take me in you
Won't be nice
Spit me out or wait
And shine me

One time
To take away all pain
One more
To turn myself insane
One time
To keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away

One time
To take away all pain
One more
To turn myself insane
One time
To keep me high all day
Makes my reality fade away---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
