You think you're special
You think you're cool
You're so invincible
You're nobody's fool

Dead man walking
Your ego's high
No matter who you are
We're all gonna die

Your time is coming
Your soul is burning
Your future's fading
I Can't Save You

Your demon's waking
Your will is breaking
Your body's shaking
I Can't Save You now, now, now, now...

(Youve got to save yourself)
I cant save you now, now, now, now
(Youve got to save yourself)
I cant save you now, now, now, now

The years are passing
The time goes fast
Youre in denial
With your head up your ass

Cant take it with you
Leave it behind
So many ways to live
Theres one way to die

Your god is calling
Your tears are falling
Youre heads exploding
I cant save you

No use in trying
You cant stop crying
You feel like dying
I cant save you now, now, now, now

(Youve got to save yourself)
I cant save you now, now, now, now
(Youve got to save yourself)
I cant save you

Tempted by your twisted mind
You destroyed your self-control
For fame and fortune you gave it all
No one said you had to sell your soul

[SOLO]

Your time is coming
Your soul is burning
Your future's fading
I can't save you

Your demon's waking
Your will is breaking
Your body's shaking
I can't save you

Your god is calling
Your tears are falling
Your heads exploding
I cant save you

No use in trying
You cant stop crying
You feel like dying
I cant save you now---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
