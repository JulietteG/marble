I met a man in New Orleans wore a Half Suit with Dark Blue Jeans
Kicked his heels together winked at me real nice
I Saw Him from a mile away
But in my state of mind I let him make his play...
"Hey boy... have you seen the other side"
Yea... in this man I saw the devils hand so I looked at him man to man said...
"This time it's gonna be a fight!"

I do not have to justify...
The way I live my life...
I do not have to justify...
The reason I'm alive...

I saw her from across the room with Diamond eyes she's heaven's jewel
Dropped two aces smiled and threw my cards back
Yea I've been that man...
who lives deceit...
Surrounds himself with worldly things...

So let me tell you a story...
Let me feed it to you...

We fled around like we were superman live in another trance a different way to dance
with dark romance you get another chance to do the dirty dance without consequence

I do not have to justify...
The way I live my life...
I do not have to justify...
The reason I'm alive...

Let me change the timbre of this section...
Add a little booze to ice...
I guess you probably noticed...
I've been living a double life...

So fly around like you are superman given another chance a different way to dance
with true romance you get another chance to tell your dirty darkest secrets

We fled around like we were superman live in another trance a different way to dance
with dark romance you get another chance to do the dirty dance without consequence

I do not have to justify...
The way I live my life...
I do not have to justify...
The reason I'm alive...

(No more) So fly around like you are superman (no more) live in another trance a different way to dance (no more) with dark romance you get another chance (no more) to do the dirty dance without consequence

It's just not me...
not me... not me...
I'm just... I'm just not you---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.
