Troublesome times are here, filling men's hearts with fear Freedom we all hold dear now is at stake Humbling your hearts to God saves from the chastening rod Seek the way pilgrims trod, Christians awake

 Jesus is coming soon, morning or night or noon Many will meet their doom, trumpets will sound All of the dead shall rise, righteous meet in the skies Going where no one dies, heavenward bound

Troubles will soon be o'er, happy forevermore When we meet on that shore, free from all care Rising up in the sky, telling this world goodbye Homeward we then shall fly, glory to share

Oh, Jesus is coming soon, morning or night or noon Many will meet their doom, trumpets will sound All of the dead shall rise, righteous meet in the skies Going where no one dies, heavenward bound

Jesus is coming soon, morning or night or noon Many will meet their doom, trumpets will sound All of the dead shall rise, righteous meet in the skies Going where no one dies, heavenward bound Heavenward bound, heavenward bound..---Lyrics submitted by AJ.
