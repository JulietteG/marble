Your smile is like the sun to me
So bright its weakening
But so sweet
But of all that you would like from me
A smile and be okay
Sorry, its taken me everyday
To accept that I have to say
Say no

Ill be right here
Say something's wrong
To just find fault
She complains the rooms too cold
But when I learn to make heat,
It's just to disappoint
Oh you know Ill forget, so quick

Time, it makes it fine
Thats how we make this life
Makes it fine
Its makes it right

Your eyes, they cant see
What it takes from me
Or how it hurts
Or how it holds our hands

Ill be right here
Say something's wrong
To just find fault
She complains the rooms too cold
But when I learn to make heat,
It's just to disappoint
Oh you know Ill forget...

So quick

You know I always forget
You know I always forget
You know I always forget---Lyrics submitted by joy.
