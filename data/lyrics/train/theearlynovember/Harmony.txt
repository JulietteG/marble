Finally found a wig I like
Its making me a familiar sight
and light let it take you there
light let it take me there

Youre like harmony
In a sad song
Bringing out the misery
You want
And Im a higher ring
You know Im out there
With you
Let the light bring you here

Finally found a wig I like
Its making me a familiar sight
and light let it take you there
light let it take me there

Youre like harmony
In a sad song
Bringing out the misery
You want
And Im a higher ring
You know Im out there
With you
Let the light bring you here

Its like harmony
In a sad song
Bringing out the misery
You want
And Im a higher ring
You know Im at there
For you
So let the light come bring you there---
