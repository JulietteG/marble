Coiled by
resistance
whatever clicks
to get things sent
isn't clicking in today
mind like my room is
messy most of the time
remember you by 
the broken vacuum you left behind

Spiralling [sic] in non-concentric logic
tensed to spring.

Cauterize (or) let it flow
every day is a catalyst;
get moving or get stuck solid
before you get into it

Magnetified
dust sits upright
angled forward
polarized
static attentive waiting
for a break in a busy line
remember motion
by the vacuum it left behind

Spiralling [sic] in non-concentric logic
tensed to spring
coiled by resistance---Lyrics submitted by Rubisco.
