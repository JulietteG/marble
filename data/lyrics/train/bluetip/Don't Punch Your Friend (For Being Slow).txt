Faulted for inferior connection
is that how to get along...
suss out supposed weakness
and do the best you can
to weed it out?

Don't punch your friend for being
slow... that's what work is for
no one wants to be
 treated like an employee

Overload it
the inputs and outputs are all
outmoded
fry the circuit
leave the host discarded
there's the exit wound
is that how to get along?

Don't punch your friend for being
slow... that's what work is for
and we're all punched out

If you got no friends
maybe you're not friendly---Lyrics submitted by Rubisco.
