I been in all day - sick of
sitting alone - makes for a hard hope.
why bother owning a phone 
when it doesn't ring.
It's a funny thing, every time I walk
down my alley the same seven dogs bark at me.
Should I let them keep me in?
I might be lonely but I'm damn sure I'm still intact.
You haven't got me licked. Don't matter what kind
of energy I got left... I'm gonna use it
Never gonna get rid of this defensive belligerence. 
(guess I never felt that comfortable 
around you all anyway)---Lyrics submitted by Rubisco.
