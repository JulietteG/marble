You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

It began when I was twenty-one years old
And my mom and dad were begging me to go
So I left a note and we went and hit the road
Me and Chris and all the stuff I own

I went out to find my soul and left the only comfort that I know
It wasn't 'bout a girl or even California bleeding
It was all about me choosing where to go

And I sing
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

There were years I felt like everything was new
Long before the troubles of my youth
There were days and nights I couldn't see the end
And I swear the music was my only friend

You learn to lie about forgiveness
When you choose to let down all your pride
I don't wanna be so famous
I just want to sing until I die

So sing it
You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve

When I wish upon a star
I'll tell it how I got this far

It began when I learn how to face myself
And I'm still deciding if I'm something else
I'm a million different people all the time
But there's only one of me to get it right

You are never gonna get
Everything you want in this world
First things first
Get what you deserve
