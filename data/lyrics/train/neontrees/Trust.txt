You, you got your head in a scream,
 And Im, Im trying to get your attention
 You appear as a child put your heart on a seam,
 But youre acting exactly as you do in my dreams
 I said you; you are not what you seem
 And youre finding out that

 Falling down can feel strange
 No one remembers your name,
 Youre losing the game
 Thats the thing about trust
 Its always the same
 Sad story again
 You lose all your friends
 Thats the thing about trust

 You, you got your head in a swing
 Yeah, I, I am trying to give you salvation
 You appear as a devil
 Like a wolf in the woods
 But your acting exactly as we expecting you would
 I said you; you read the words that I sing, its a shock to the system

 Falling down can feel strange
 No one remembers your name,
 Youre losing the game
 Thats the thing about trust
 Its always the same
 Sad story again
 You lose all your friends
 Thats the thing about trust

 Dont lie to me when the pressures on, you gotta have trust
 Dont lie to me when the pressures on, you gotta have trust
 Dont lie to me when the pressures on, you gotta have trust
 Dont lie to me when the pressures on, I said you gotta have trust

[2x]
 Falling down can feel strange
 No one remembers your name,
 Youre losing the game
 Thats the thing about trust
 Its always the same
 Sad story again
 You lose all your friends
 Thats the thing about trust---Lyrics submitted by Sierra.
