I don't believe in a life without consequences.
Do you believe when I say that Im not impressed?
You say I never, Ever, Ever, Ever wanna talk again
I dont believe a single word you said.

I think I wanna run away from you, youre killing me.
But I know I wanna see you in a day or two.
I dont believe that a single word you said is true.

I guess its 
Loooooove
In the 21st century
Oh, oh its tough
Broken heart technology
Your kisses taste so sweet
But then you click delete
Love in the 21st century
Love in the 21st century

I dont believe making out is a dead romance.
I miss the days being kids simple holding hands
Im sick of wondering if you would ever call me back
I check my 4 different accounts just to end up being mad.

Wish I could dissect your brain apart
It takes a vivisection just to understand your heart
If we could just own up, get wound up, messed up

I guess its 
Loooooove
In the 21st century
Oh, oh its tough
Broken heart technology
Your kisses taste so sweet
But then you click delete
Love in the 21st century
Love in the 21st century

Im in the 21st century
Oh, it gets so critical
We become caught up in the trivial
My dear, were both a bit too cynical
Come close, Ill give you something spiritual
Stand up and deliver me
Were in love in the 21st century---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
