Lonely eyes been watching me
I can see what you want me to see
I wanna be close to you
All we need now is the dark
Dancing shadows move on to white walls
I wanna be close to you

Heavy eyes been watching me
Rhythms beats and melodies
They make me get close to you
Other guys will sell you tricks
Tell you lies to get their fix
Don't let them get close to you

Give me fire, give me fire
It'll burn all your fear away
Give me fire, give me fire
It'll burn all your fear away
Give me fire, give me fire
It'll burn all your fear away
Give me fire, give me fire
It'll burn all your fear away

I still got my eyes on you baby
I still got my eyes on you baby
I still got my eyes on you baby
I still got my eyes on you baby
I wanna be close to you
I still got my eyes on you baby
I still got my eyes on you baby
I still got my eyes on you baby
I still got my eyes on you baby
I wanna be close to you

I wanna be close to you ---Lyrics submitted by roz.
