When you're hurt you heal others
when you're in need you give
because of you, I am living
the most that I can live.

Oh-oh sweet darling girl
I'm so glad you found me,
Oh-oh sweet darling girl
you're power surrounds me.

Remember me, don't forget me
I have something true
my path is dark, my steps uncertain
the less I walk with you,

Oh-oh sweet darling girl
I'm so glad you found me,
oh-oh sweet darling girl
you're power surrounds me,

You're power, you're power
you're power. oh..
surrounds me.

You speak to me, without speaking
you touch so I can feel
with your strength, I am stronger
at last I know I'm real.

oh-oh sweet darling girl
I'm so glad you found me,
oh-oh sweet darling girl,
you're power surrounds me

You're power, you're power
you're power. oh..

woaw, sweet darling girl
woaw, sweet darling girl
woaw, sweet darling girl
I'm so glad that you found me
I'm so glad that you found me
I'm so glad that you found me
you found me
yeah you did
you're power surrounds me,---Lyrics submitted by sophie.
