everybody's trying to be the best
what about the girl with loneliness
i like her sundress, i like her sundress
what about the girl with loneliness

and from the inside out
you are so beautiful
i wanna hold you in my hand

i'd do everything you want me to
i'd do everything you want me to
do

i wanna start going on a morning walk
what about the days when we used to talk
i don't need a smile from a mannequin
i just wanna hold you in my hand

i'd do everything you want me to
i'd do everything you want me to
i'd do everything you want me to
do

and from the inside out
you've changed girl you know you have
don't make a good thing bad
just let me hold you in my hand

i'd do everything you want me to
i'd do everything you want me to
do

i'd do everything, everything, everything
i'd do everything you want me to
i'd do everything you want me to
do, whoah, do, whoah, do, whoah
for you---Lyrics submitted by chandler.
