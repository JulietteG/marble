Get them out 
Ah 

Watch out, you might get what you're after 
Cool baby, strange but not a stranger 
I'm an ordinary guy 
Burning down the house 

Hold tight, wait 'til the party's over 
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather 
There has got to be a way 
Burning down the house 

Here's your ticket, pack your bags 
Time for jumpin' overboard 
Transportation is here 
Close enough but not too far, 
Maybe you know where you are 
Fightin' fire with fire, huah 

All wet, hey you might need a raincoat 
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight 
Three hundred, sixty five degrees 
Burning down the house 

It was once upon a place sometimes, I listen to myself 
Gonna come in first place 
People on their way to work say baby what did you expect 
Gonna burst into flame 
Go ahead 

Burning down the house 
My house, is out of the ordinary 
That's right, don't want to hurt nobody 
Some things, sure can sweep me off my feet 
Burning down the house 

No visible means of support and you have not seen nothin' yet 
Everything's stuck together 
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set 
Fightin' fire with fire, huah 

Yea 
Burning down the house 
Burning down the house 
Burning down the house---
