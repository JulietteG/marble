Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am poster girl with no poster
I'm 32 flavours and then some

Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I'm a poster girl with no poster
I'm 32 flavours and then some 
and I'm beyond your peripheral vision
so you might want to turn your head
cause someday you're going to be hungry
and eat all of the words you just said 

I am
what i am
I am 32 flavours and then some

and god help you if you are an ugly girl
course too pretty is also your doom
cause everyone harbors a secret hatred
for the prettiest girl in the room
god help you if you are a phoenix
and you dare to rise up from the ash
a thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy
while you are just flying past

I am
what I am
I am 32 flavours and then some
taking my chances as they come
I am 32 flavours and then some
I'm nobody but I am someone
I am someone 

I'm not trying to give my life meaning
by demeaning you
and I would like to state for the record
I did everything that I could do

I am beyond your peripheral vision
so you might want to turn your head
cause someday you're going to be starving 
and eating all of the words you just said 

The words you just said 
Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am poster girl with no poster
I'm 32 flavours and then some

Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I'm a poster girl with no poster
I'm 32 flavours and then some 
and I'm beyond your peripheral vision
so you might want to turn your head
cause someday you're going to be hungry
and eat all of the words you just said 

I am
what i am
I am 32 flavours and then some

and god help you if you are an ugly girl
course too pretty is also your doom
cause everyone harbors a secret hatred
for the prettiest girl in the room
god help you if you are a phoenix
and you dare to rise up from the ash
a thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy

while you are just flying past

I am
what I am
I am 
what I am
I am 32 flavours and then some
I'm taking my chances as they come
I'm 32 flavours and then some
I'm looking for truth but there is none
I am 32 flavours and then some
I never forget where i came from
I am 32 flavours and then some 
I'm nobody but I am someone
I am 32 flavours and then 
I'm taking my chances as they come 
I'm 32 flavours and then some
I'm looking for truth but there is none---Lyrics submitted by Helen.
