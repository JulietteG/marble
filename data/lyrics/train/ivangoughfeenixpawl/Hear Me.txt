(feat. Christine Hoberg)

Something calling out there in the distance
Picks us up when we are low

Its like a heart beating
Something low something sweet
Must be calling us back home

And I know the dark side
Could hold you
But not long
What would you do
When you hide
You find out
Is it all you know

I know the dark light
Could hold you
But not too long
and I know that someday
Youll come back
When you hear me calling

Hear me calling
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
Hear me calling

Something calling out there in the distance
Picks us up when we are low

Its like a heart beating
Something low something sweet
Must be calling us back home

And I know the dark side
Could hold you
But not long
What would you do
When you hide
You find out
Is it all you know

I know the dark light
Could hold you
But not too long
and I know that someday
Youll come back
When you hear me calling

Hear me calling
Hear me calling---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
