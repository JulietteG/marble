Hello world
This is me
Life should be
Fun for everyone 
Every now and then
I'm insecure
Let me show you life
Can be so pure
Seize the day
Wear a big happy smile
On your face
In every life
A little rain will fall
That won't change
My attitude at all
You are you
I am me
We'll be free 
Hello world
This is me
Life should be
Mm mm yeah
Fun for everyone
Hello world
Come and see
Life should be
Fun for everyone 
Life is easy if
You wear a smile
Just be yourself
Don't ever
Change your style
I like you
You like me
Let's have fun be happy
Look into my eyes and
Tell me straight
For you I'll
Make the whole world wait
Let me know
If it's so
Let it show 
Hello world
This is me
Life should be
Mm mm yeah
Fun for everyone
Hello world
Come and see
This is me 
Come on baby
Don't be afraid
Come on baby
It's not too late
Say you do
Won't you open up the door
And let me in? 
Dee dee dee yeah
Dee dee yeah yeah yeah
Open up the door
For me yeah yeah yeah
Mm mm yeah 
Hello world
This is me
Life should be
Mm mm yeah
Fun for everyone
Hello world
Come and see
Life should be
Fun for everyone 
Hello world
This is me
Life should be
Fun for you
Just fun for me yeah
Fun for everyone
Fun for everyone---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
