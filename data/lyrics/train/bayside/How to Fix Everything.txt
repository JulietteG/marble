The sharper the edge the cleaner the wound
so I'll be keeping it dull tonight for I deserve to hurt
disfigure the outside to show how ruined i am
thre's no pain and no pleasure when you're too numb to feel

There's a pedistal across the room 
and if i try to climb again this time the fall is fatal
but i don't deserve such an easy exit 
so maybe my spine can snap on impact and i'll have to crawl away

I'm ready to take that big step 
Start taring off the layers i put up
or is it too late to be 
anything but what i am 
identify the problem now let's see 
if we can fix anything

Just close the door and let me do what i need 
'cause it's better for us if you just let me leave

How to fix everything---Lyrics submitted by Sydney.
