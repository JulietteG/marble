Some days 
I get crazed 
I don't know why it's all relevant 
I'll take deep breaths 
And keep control, go on. 

I've tried brave 
And you've tried to save 
I'm proud to keep it bottled up 
I think I past my prime and lost my mind and I'm torn. 

No telling what tomorrow holds. 
Who let, who let this feeling die, when all I did was try? 
Who let, you let this feeling die, 
I can't get you out of my head, my head. 
You're the flame that burns me so I know that I'm still alive. 

Some say 
It's all fate 
but I say we control our lives 
And if my destiny should outbest me then that's fine. 
I make believe thrill and apathy co-exist in me fairly equally 
The truth is doubts are all I've got to call mine. 

No telling what tomorrow holds. 
No telling what voice takes control. 
Who let, who let this feeling die, when all I did was try? 
Who let, you let this feeling die, 
I can't get you out of my head, my head. 
And you're the flame that burns me so I know that I'm still alive. 

Is there anybody out there (out there) 
Is anybody calling (anybody calling) 
Woaahh, if what i say is really wrong 
Is there anybody out there (out there) 
Is anybody calling (anybody calling) 
Woooah, if what you say is really wrong. 
I'm not in control, I think I'm out of control 

Who let, who let this feeling die, when all I did was try? 
Who let, you let this feeling die, 
I can't get you out of my head, my head. 
And you're the flame that burns me so I know that I'm still alive.---Lyrics submitted by amanda.
