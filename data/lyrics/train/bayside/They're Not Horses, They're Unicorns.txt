You're pulling out your teeth,
And all the Novocain you pump in your cheek.
That's why I'm still around,
You've got blood running down your chin.
But you suffer peacefully.
(but you suffer peacefully)

She was a termite,
Eating away at my roots.
I was just a lost soul,
Who needed a home.
I was filling a void with you.
And I can't can't wait,
Till you see see see
What death and disgust
have done to me.
And I spent three years,
Which you fort to think that
One day you'd break and I'd get to see,
How all the the choices you made,
Would drive you insane.
I wish we never met.

Cause angry act I sound,
That's just a way I cover up the way I feel.
I've been that way for years and years,
A slave to broken hearts and sex appeal.

She was a termite,
Eating away at my roots.
I was just a lost soul,
Who needed a home.
I was filling a void with you.
And I can't can't wait,
Till you see see see
What death and disgust
have done to me.
And I spent three years,
Which you fort to think that
One day you'd break and I'd get to see,
How all the the choices you made,
Would drive you insane.
I wish we never met.

She was a termite,
Eating away at my roots.
I was just a lost soul,
Who needed a home.
I was filling a void with you.
And I can't can't wait,
Till you see see see
What death and disgust
have done to me.
And I spent three years,
Which you fort to think that
One day you'd break and I'd get to see,
How all the the choices you made,
Would drive you insane.
I wish we never met.---Lyrics submitted by Kasey.
