Same old story is back again
She's not a lover, she's just a friend
I'm sick and tired for you
To blame on me

Now you think it's funny
Now you wanna spend your money
On girls but you forgot when you were down
That I was around

Call my lover, hang up, call again
What in the world is happening
Listen in, but don't yell at me

Isn't it ironic
All you wanna do is smoke chronic?
Boy, you forgot when you were down
Who was around

I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

Memories don't live like people do
I'm sick for ever believing you
Wish you'd bring back the man I knew
Was good to me, oh, Lord

Every time you say you're coming
Boy, you disappoint me, honey
How well you forgot when you were down
And I was around

I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

One of these days, it's gonna happen to you
Missing a love like I'm missing you, babe, yeah, yeah
One of these days, when your dreams come true
That's the one that's gonna do it to you, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore---
