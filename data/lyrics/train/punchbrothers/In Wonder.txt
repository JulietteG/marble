Mother, Father: I'm standing
Standing and I'm not about to fall
When I can speak I'll tell you not to worry
Or be sorry for anything,
'cause no one understands this world at all

My father swept me over his shoulders
Above the empty cars to see the fair
A slowly spinning wheel of smiling neighbors,
and flowers from my mother
Who sang to me that night of love and death,
'cause everybody sings of love and death.

We dreamt our sons and daughters a high wire
Connecting the four corners of the earth
The wire disappeared and left them standing on nothing;
in thin air
They're standing and they're not about to fall;
standing and they're not about to fall

Child you'll grow up
In wonder, like we'll grow old
Like our parents did, and their parents before
It was written on the faces in the waiting room
the day you were born---
