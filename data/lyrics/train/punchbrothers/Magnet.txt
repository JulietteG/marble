I pinned her to the wall and said I wanna take you home
I wanna take you home
Think about it
She threw me to the floor and said I wanna take you home
I wanna take you home
Think about it
What's the center between two centers of attention
Is there a center between to centers of attention
Or only tension between two centers of attention
And then there's...

'Cause I'm a magnet
And you're a magnet
And we're pushing each other away...
Baby I'm a blank check
And you're a blank check
To whose order we going to pay...

I laughed away a tear and said what if you took me now
What if you took me here
Think about it
She locked the hallway door and said you're gonna take me now
You're gonna take me here
Don't think about it
But I thought about it
What's the center between two centers of attention
A center of attention's its own center of attention
There's only tension between two centers of attention
And then there's...

'Cause I'm a magnet
And you're a magnet
And we're pushing each other away...
Baby I'm a blank check
And you're a blank check
Our very own order to pay...
'Cause we're pushing each other away
We're pushing each other away... ---
