I died happy in my sleep
I died happy in my sleep
Our children around and you looking down
from heaven's a julep on the porch
heaven's a julep on the porch
You and me rocking the grandfather clock is tick tick talking
to the time we used to wind it

She brought the sugar and the mint
She brought the sugar and the mint
And he brought the whiskey
Asked for my blessing
"Yes sir, I know she's
heaven's a julep on the porch"

Heaven's a julep on the porch
You and me rocking the grandfather clock is tick tick talking
to the time we used to wind it
God the time we used to wind it

Now the time stands still
We can drink our fill
Out of silver
That will never
Tarnish like we will

You weren't just a girl that I should meet
You were the girl that I would meet
For drinks in the backyard
A beautiful daughter
A Lifetime of summer
And love ever after
I died happy in my sleep
I died happy in my sleep
Our children around and you looking down from heaven's a julep on the porch
Heaven's a julep on the porch
You and me rocking the grandfather clock is tick tick tick tick
talking to the time we used to wind it
God the time We used to wind it... ---
