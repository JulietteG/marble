The sun hits the back of my neck through a crack in the window shade
I blow it off
I blow it off
'Cause I keep outside in the ears and eyes of friends I've never made
So I blow it off
I blow it off

There's nothing to say
That couldn't just as well be sent
I've got an American shell of 21st century stress

Your trouble vibrates the table, interrupts my reverie
I blow it off
I blow it off
'Cause if it's that bad it ain't getting better face to face with me
So I blow it off
I blow it off

There's nothing to say
That couldn't just as well be sent
I've got an American shell of 21st century stress
Just go ahead and bloody up your knuckles knocking at my door
I'll blow 'em off
I'll blow 'em off...

(The sun hits the back of my neck through a crack in the window shade
But I keep outside in the ears and eyes of my friends I've never made...)
((Your trouble vibrates the table interrupts my reverie
But if it's all that bad it ain't getting better face to face with me...))

Cause there's nothing to say that couldn't just as well be sent
We've all got an American share of 21st century stress
See the oceans rise and leave the nations crying at heaven's door
I blew it off
I blew it off ---
