They locked me up they threw away the key
Said they're gonna put me thru the perils of hell
No turnin back they say I'll never be free
I'm headed to the Iron Bar Motel.

Chorus
Iron bar motel locked up in a cell
They say its just like hell at the iron bar motel.

There ain't no way I'm gonna shed a tear
My spirits way to high
I know some day I'm getting outta here
Break these bars and fly

Chorus

Iron Bar Motel ain't got no room service
Iron Bar Motel got no color TV.
Iron Bar Motel you can never check out of the Iron Bar Motel.
