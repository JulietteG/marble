So many times I've asked the question
Who's to say one mans good and ones evil
One mans garbage is another mans treasure
And they ying and yang of life goes on.

Well, I've read the good book
I've read lots that were bad
I've seen the daylight
Then theres times I wish I had
But I gotta know

Is there rock and roll in heaven
Is there rock and roll in hell
If there's rock and roll in heaven
We're gonna raise a little hell.

Judgement days coming or so they say
I've just got one question for the judge that day
Where's the rock and roll take the elevator up or down
If I'm there for the rest of my time I got to have those sounds

There's times I believed in nothin
Times I've been to the wishin well
Times when I've prayed in silence
Times when I've raised hell.

Is there rock and roll in heaven......
