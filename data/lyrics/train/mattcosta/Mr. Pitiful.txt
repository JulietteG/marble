Oh Mr. Pit- 
Oh Mr. Pit- 
Mr. Pitiful
Who let you down
who let you down
who let you down?

You still don't believe
you don't believe
you don't believe
When your grievances show
or when your soapbox unfolds

but please come down
From that cloud
you're sitting on
i don't expect you to admit
that you were wrong

Just want to know how you feel
don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
Mulling it all over in my bed

I hope that you see through your picket
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence

to make amends
still be friends
still be my friend

So where did you go
where did you go
where did you go
while i was out
while i was out
while i was out

Well, I don't believe 
I don't believe
I don't believe
everything i see

And if you don't like the movie 
Then quit acting

but please come down
From that cloud
you're sitting on
i don't expect you to admit
that you were wrong

Just want to know how you feel
don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
Mulling it all over in my bed

I hope that you see through your picket
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence

to make amends
still be friends
still be friends
still be my friend
still be my friend
still be my friend---Lyrics submitted by Rowan.
