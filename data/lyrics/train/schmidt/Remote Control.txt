Does it make you feel nervous 
Playing in my game
Glad to be of service
Danger is my name

So I make you feel reckless
Like youre off control
You're gonna lose you inhibitions
Youre gonna sell your soul 
Don't be shy, come on, take a risk Come and sit with me
Oh, I must insist

I push your button to get you jumpin Get up and turn me on so I can get some lovin'
I gotcha, I gotcha
On remote control
I push your button to get you jumpin Get up and turn me on so I can get some lovin'
I gotcha, I gotcha
On remote control 
Nobody is looking
It's not against the law
I know what you got cooking  Lets get on the floor
 Do I make you feel horny?
So you can't think straight I wanna be a little naughty
Just do what I say  Take a chance, baby, don't be scared
I'm gonna make you dance in my underwear

I push your button to get you jumpin Get up and turn me on so I can get some lovin'
I gotcha, I gotcha
On remote control
I push your button to get you jumpin Get up and turn me on so I can get some lovin'
I gotcha, I gotcha
On remote control 
Got some things for us to try This wont end till tomorrow night Baby, thats right This is not about romance This could be your only chance Baby, thats right 
I gotcha, I gotcha
On remote control

I push your button to get you jumpin Get up and turn me on so I can get some lovin'
I gotcha, I gotcha
On remote control

I push your button to get you jumpin Get up and turn me on so I can get some lovin'
I gotcha, I gotcha
On remote control
