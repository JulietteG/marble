Saw you in the crowd  
The music was loud yeah 
You looked me in the eyes 
And something inside went  

Oh what beautiful night 
You set something off inside 
Just like a stick of dynamite  

You sang in my ear 
But all I could hear was 
You kissed me on the lips 
So hot and my hips went  
The devil in me is gonna 
Raise your heartbeat yeah 
If you wanna striptease you 
you gotta get on your knees and  

Boom Boom

Oh what a dirty night 
You set something off inside 
Just like a stick of dynamite  

My heart is pumping like a gun 
Theres only one thing to be done 
Lets find a place where we can hide 
Before the night has been and died  

My heart is pumping like a gun 
Theres only one thing to be done 
Lets find a place where we can hide 
Before the night has been and died  

You better watch out
Cos you know what Im about yeah 
Do you wanna go 
Where I think you wanna go now?

My daddy has a gun
So you better be careful 
Treat the girl right  
Or you know it could be fatal

My heart is pumping like a gun 
There's only one thing to be done 
Let's find a place where we can hide 
Before the night has been and died---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
