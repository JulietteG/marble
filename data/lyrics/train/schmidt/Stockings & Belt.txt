Aint gonna dress for you like a whore
If you dont want to love me no more
Aint gonna wear stockings and belt
If you cant make my heart melt

The time is over for fantasy
What is happening to you and me?

I would dress up for you like a queen 
Give you everything you desired
Why cant I cry any tears?
Were out of ideas to inspire

Aint gonna share my double bed
Aint gonna give you any head
Aint gonna wear handcuffs and chain
If you dont want to give me your name

Theres nothing more for us to say
The time for talking is over today

I would dress up for you like a queen 
Give you everything you desired
When did the fairytale stop?
When did our love expire?

I would dress up for you like a queen 
Give you everything you desired
Why cant I cry any tears?
Were out of ideas to inspire

Aint gonna dress for you like a whore
If you dont want to love me no more
Aint gonna wear stockings and belt
If you cant make my heart melt---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
