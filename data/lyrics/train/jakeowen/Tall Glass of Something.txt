Its 100 degrees now were makin
And thats making me wanna drink

Got a truck full of peaches
Single beaches round here but we gotta stay in rank

Theres a bar in the back, yea thats where were hanging
Its a kiddy pool and a hose, kinda think we need ice

Solos, toyos
Lift em up

I need a tall glass of something nice and strong
A little liquor and a loving to do all night long
I need a kick in the chest, a shot to the mix
A little hot, make this martini shake your hips
I said tequila, margarita, senorita please
Chase it down with a Corona and some sex on the beach
A yellow umbrella foamy style, a kiss on my cheek
Just you and me, thats all I need
Oh and a tall glass of something

(Sippin and juggin, sippin and juggin juggin)
(Sippin and juggin, sippin and juggin juggin juggin)

Ill tell you one thing about me
I get thirsty about 5:30
In the sunshine or the rain
So choo choo baby, come on hop on the train

Lift em up

I need a tall glass of something nice and strong
A little liquor and a loving to do all night long
I need a kick in the chest, a shot to the mix
A little hot, make this martini shake your hips
I said tequila, margarita, senorita please
Chase it down with a Corona and some sex on the beach
A yellow umbrella foamy style, a kiss on my cheek
Just you and me, thats all I need
Oh and a tall glass of something
