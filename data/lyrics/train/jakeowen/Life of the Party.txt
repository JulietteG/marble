(Verse)
Swear I was gonna tell em the truth
That was til everybody started asking bout you
And I didnt know what to say
Came up with some lame excuse
Why you were gone
Said you were gonna come later on
Planted a smile on my face
Like everything was okay

(Chorus)
I was hanging around, walk in the crowd
Everybody singing along to my songs
Taking my shots, throwing them back
Acting like you aint gone
But I dont want em to know Im all alone
And I aint got nobody
I dont want em to see you died inside
So I guess Ill be the life
Life of the party

(Verse)
And then one of your friends
Came up and gave me a hug and asked me how weve been
I smiled and said were better than weve ever been
Well I dont know why
I had to lie
Guess I didnt wanna tell er that you said goodbye
I couldnt even look er in the eye
So I kept on

(Chorus)
Hanging around, walk in the crowd
Everybody singing along to my songs
Taking my shots, throwing them back
Acting like you aint gone
But I dont want em to know Im all alone
And I aint got nobody
I dont want em to see you died inside
So I guess Ill be the life
Life of the party

(Bridge)
Everybody thinkin Im feelin good
Everybody thinkin Im havin a real good time
Dont know the truth about you and I

(Chorus)
So Im hanging around, walk in the crowd
Everybody singing along to my songs
Taking my shots, throwing them back
Acting like you aint gone
But I dont want em to know Im all alone
And I aint got nobody
I dont want em to see you died inside
So I guess Ill be the life
Life of the party

Life of the party
Life of the party
So I guess Ill be the life
Life of the party

Swear I was gonna tell em the truth
But I didnt know what to say---
