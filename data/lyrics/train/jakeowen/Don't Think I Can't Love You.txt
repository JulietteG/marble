I learned the hard way real early in life
And money, sure don't grow on a tree
And there's a few things that a dollar can't buy
The best things in life they come free

So girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring, no house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Awh but baby don't think I can't love you

And when I get home after working all day
I'm beat down girl, I'm dead on my feet
But as tired as I am, if you wanna play, well playin' sounds real good to me

Cause girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring, no house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Awh but baby don't think I can't love you

So girl I can't buy you a big diamond ring, no house on a hill full of life's finer things
And I'll tell you right now there's a whole lot that I just can't do
Awh but baby, baby, awh baby, don't think I can't love you, ohhh ohhhhhhh---Lyrics submitted by Emilee.
