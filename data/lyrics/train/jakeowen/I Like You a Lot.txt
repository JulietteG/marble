Me and my buddies grew up on the farm
Cant say much went youre working that hard
Just too tired to talk when the day is through
Never been much for writing love letters,
A bunch of wildflowers seem to say it much better
So if youre asking on how I feel about me and you

Yeah we ride like a Cadillac
Run like a deer
Girl I aint just whistling Dixie to tickle your ear
Tied tied a little rope in a double square knot
What Im trying to say in the most romantic way that I got,
Is that I like you a lot, I like you a lot, a whole lot

Well I hope you are happy I finally said it,
Took me awhile so dont you forget it,
Ive always heard dont fix it if it aint broke,
So if you aint doing anything latter at 11,
Come over and take a ride in the CJ7
Ill take you places you aint seen before

We ride like a Cadillac
Run like a deer
Girl I aint just whistling Dixie to tickle your ear
Tied tied a little rope in a double square knot
What Im trying to say in the most romantic way that I got,
Is that I like you a lot, yeah I like you a lot, a whole lot

Yeah we ride like a Cadillac (ride like a Cadillac)
Run like a deer (Run like a deer)
Girl I aint just whistling Dixie to tickle your ear
Tied tied a little rope (tied tied a little rope) in a double square knot (in a double square knot)
What I'm trying to say in the most romantic way that I got,
Is that I like you a lot, (yeah I do) yeah I like you a lot, (alright I said it) a whole lot

Yeah we ride like a Cadillac (ride like a Cadillac)
Run like a deer (Run like a deer)
Girl I aint just whistling Dixie to tickle your ear
Tied tied a little rope (tied tied a little rope) in a double square knot (in a double square knot)
What Im trying to say in the most romantic way that I got,
Is that I like you a lot, yeah I like you a lot, a whole lot ---
