(Verse)
Looks like your cups empty
And youre all alone
I got the good stuff with me
Can you hear that song?
It just came on, girl

(Verse)
I can tell that youre feelin it
I see the words runnin off your lips
And youre crazy cool
Same night, same spot
Dont it look like weve got some good timing?

(Chorus)
Just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
It feels like it was meant to be yea
No, I dont think its coincidence
Running into you here like this
Sparks flying, see you smiling
Baby aint it crazy? We got good timing

(Verse)
Look up to that sky girl
Its a full moon night
You just broke up with somebody
Baby so did I
Just the other night, girl

(Verse)
Can you believe what time it is?
11:11, lets make a wish
Were gonna have a night well never forget
And it aint over yet
Girl we got some good timing

(Chorus)
Just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
It feels like it was meant to be yea
No, I dont think its coincidence
Running into you here like this
Sparks flying, see you smiling
Baby aint it crazy? We got good timing

(Verse)
It used to be the only luck I had was a day late dollar short, always bad
And then I saw your face and it all changed up
Baby just like that
Its alright
Right on the money, on the spot
Girl we got some good timing

(Chorus)
Just a boy and a girl underneath these stars shining
It feels like it was meant to be yea
No, I dont think its coincidence
Running into you here like this
Sparks flying, see you smiling
Baby aint it crazy? We got good timing

Good timing
Good timing---
