(a-wa a-wa) Si-bona kwenze ka kanjani 
(a-wa a-wa) Amanto mbazane ayeza 

Shes a rich girl 
She dont try to hide it 
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes 

Hes a poor boy 
Empty as a pocket 
Empty as a pocket with nothing to lose 
Sing, Ta na na 
Ta na na na 
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes 
Ta na na 
Ta na na na 
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes 
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes 
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes 
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes 
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes 

People say shes crazy 
Shes got diamonds on the soles of her shoes 
Well, thats one way to lose these 
Walking blues 
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes 

She was physically forgotten 
Then she slipped into my pocket 
With my car keys 
She said, Youve taken me for granted 
Because I please you 
Wearing these diamonds 

And I could say, Oo oo oo 
As if everybody knows 
What Im talking about 
As if everybody here would know 
What I was talking about 
Talking about diamonds on the soles of her shoes 

She makes the sign of a teaspoon 
He makes the sign of a wave 
The poor boy changes clothes 
And puts on aftershave 
To compensate for his ordinary shoes 

And she said, Honey take me dancing 
But they ended up by sleeping 
In a doorway 
By the bodegas and the lights on 
Upper Broadway 
Wearing diamonds on the soles of their shoes 

And I could say Oo oo oo 
And everybody here would know 
What I was talking about 
I mean, everybody here would know exactly 
What I was talking about 
Talking about diamonds 

People say Im crazy 
I got diamonds on the soles of my shoes 
Well, thats one way to lose 
These walking blues 
Diamonds on the soles of your shoes---
