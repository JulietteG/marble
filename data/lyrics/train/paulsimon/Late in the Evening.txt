First thing I remember, I was lying in my bed
I couldnt've been no more than one or two
And I remember there's a radio, coming from the room next door
My mother laughed the way some ladies' do

Well it's late in the evening, and the music's seeping through

The next thing I remember, I am walking down the street
I'm feeling alright I'm with my boys and with my troops, yeah
Down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
And I heard the sound of acapella groups, yeah

Singin' late in the evening, and all the girls out on the stoops, yeah
Then I learned to play some lead guitar, I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a Jay
When I come back to the room, everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play

It was late in the evening, and I blew that room away

The first thing I remember when you came into my life
I said I wanna get that girl, no matter what I do
Well I guess I've been in love before and once or twice have been on the floor
But I've never loved no-one the way that I love you

And it was late in the evening, and all the music's seeping through---Lyrics submitted by Adnaan.
