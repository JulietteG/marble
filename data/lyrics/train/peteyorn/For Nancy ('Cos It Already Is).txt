And when you said I could not stay with you
That's not the way you would have wanted to be
Convice yourself that everything is alright
'Cos it already is

Don't sell your heart and break just anyone
I want to run with you through northern fields
Convince yourself that everything is alright
'Cos it already is (2 x)

So take your lessons hard and stay with him
When your car crash comes don't be misled
Convince yourself that everything is alright
'Cos it already is (2 x)

So take your lessons hard and stay with him
When your car crash comes don't be misled
Convince yourself that everything is alright
'Cos it already is (2 x)

And it already is

So take him home (3 x)

Take him home (2 x)---Lyrics submitted by Allison Sliko.
