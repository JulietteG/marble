Is there anybody out there
Is there anybody waiting
Getting sick of your surroundings
All you want is some attention

You can tell the truth
You can tell a lie
Say anything you want to say
Are we all just lost in time

Is there reason not to change
Stay the same, become a new thing
Walk backwards, step beyond
Never forget where we come from

And you can tell the truth
And you can tell a lie
Wonder with what anyone says
We will be alright

Straight outta suburbia
Straight outta the basement
Had another lost weekend
Need another vacation
Straight outta suburbia
Straight outta the basement
Had another lost weekend
Need another vacation
Straight outta suburbia
Straight outta suburbia

Straight out of the dressing room
I wear my new clothes
Fall down thinking about you
Straight out of the dressing room
I wear my new clothes
Fall down thinking about you

Straight outta the basement
Straight outta the basement
Straight outta the basement
Straight outta the basement

Straight outta suburbia
Straight out of the basement
Had another lost weekend
Need another vacation
Straight out of suburbia
Straight out of the basement
Had another lost weekend
Need another vacation
Straight outta suburbia
Straight outta suburbia---
