There's a sadness in your eyes
It's the call you wait to make just to surprise me
Days on days off
We know it's less dangerous
Days on days off
We know this is dangerous

It's the roses in the water
It's the highlight of your night
When the jasmine bloomed on Sunset Blvd
And we fell in love for the first time

It's a ringing in your ears
It's a sickness that you fear
Days on days off
We know it's less dangerous
Days on days off
We know this is dangerous

It's the water in the roses
It's the headlights in the night
When the jasmine bloomed on Sunset Blvd
And we fell in love for the first time
When we fell in love for the first time

It's the daylight in your eyes
It's the call you wait to make just to surprise me
Days on days off
We know it's less dangerous
Days on days off
We know when it's dangerous

It's the roses in the water
It's the highlight of your night
When the jasmine blooms on Sunset Blvd
I remember the first time we fell in love
I remember the first time we fell in love
I remember the first time we fell in love---
