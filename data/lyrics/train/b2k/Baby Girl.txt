There are times when i look in your eyes
 i see the love that we shared
 i see the joy inside
 but i didn't see the feelings you hide
 and now you're saying goodbye
 because your love has died

 And all i can think about is you
 the way you say you love me
 too
 and everytime i close my eyes i see your face
 my love can never be erased 
 and you can never be replaced...baby

 baby girl
 why don't you come back to me
 why don't you love me anymore
 baby girl
 you know i still care for you
 you know i will love you forevermore...(2x)

 There are times
 when i kiss you goodnight
 I feel the love that we shared
 I feel the joy inside
 but I didn't feel what you tried to hide
 and now you're saying goodbye
 because your feeling has died

 And all i can think about is you
 the way you say you love me too
 and everytime i close my eyes i see your face
 my love can never be erased 
 and you can never be replaced...baby

 baby girl
 why don't you come back to me
 why don't you love me anymore
 baby girl
 you know i still care for you
 you know i will love you forevermore...(2x)---Lyrics submitted by loan.
