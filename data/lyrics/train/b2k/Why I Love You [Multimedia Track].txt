[Vesre 1:]
From day one you and I've been friends.
Hangin out, havin fun, chillin.
Now I know at times I got crazy, silly ways and actin shady.
You peep things in me that no one sees.
You hold it down fo shizzy.
Now I have friends I thought were true but no one more true than you.
So what am I gonna do.
It took a while for me to see how special you treated me 

[Chorus:]
Maybe thats the reason why I love you.
You're my heart girl.
And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here girl.
Noone else can meka me feel like you do.
You've shared my world.
Baby thats the reason why I love you.

[Verse 2:]
No other girl is quite like you.
And noone has my back like you do.
Girl you're one of a kind and you blow my mind.
And I'm glad to say you're mine.
Girl you're the one that changed me from a boy into a man.

[Chorus:]
Maybe thats the reason why I love you.
You're my heart girl.
And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here girl.
Noone else can make me feel like you do.
You've shared my world.
Baby thats the reason why I love you.

It took a while for me to see how special you treated me.
Maybe thats the reason why I love you.
You're my heart girl.
And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here girl.
Noone else can make me feel like you do.
You've shared my world.
Baby thats the reason why I love you.

Maybe thats the reason why I love you.
You're my heart girl.
And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here girl.
Noone else can make me feel like you do.
You've shared my world.
Baby thats the reason why I love you.

I Love You, maybe thats the reason why I love you.---Lyrics submitted by Jess.
