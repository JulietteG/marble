Just like in the Bible days
when you let Peter walk on the sea
Lord please increase my faith 
and bend me Lord to come to Thee

Lord calm da seas in my life
So Lord on You I can keep my eyes 
So dont let the storms roar
But dont stop the rain so that I might grow

And when situations get me down
Sometimes I feel like "throwing in the towel" 
But with you Lord I can stand
I can make it, You hold my hand

Lord calm da seas in my life
So Lord on You I can keep my eyes 
So dont let the storms roar
But dont stop the rain so that I might grow

Let it fall down on me
If I go through it, it will help my faith increase (x2)

Lord calm da seas in my life
So Lord on You I can keep my eyes 
So dont let the storms roar
But dont stop the rain so that I might grow (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Andrea.
