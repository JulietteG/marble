I gotta say
 Boy, after only just a couple of dates
 You're hands down, outright blowing my mind 
 In nearly every single way

 You're amazing and yet
 There's only so much I can get
 From picnics, long walks, flowers and talks
 So baby here's what I suggest

 It's time I see ya belly-up to a bar
 How 'bout ya show me what kind of cowboy you are?

 Are you a Kenny tequila, Buffet margarita
 Or an Alan Jackson hurricane?
 Are you a good time, flask of moonshine
 Going George Strait to my brain?
 A girl can tell a lot about a boy in one shot
 I gotta know you've got a Bocephus side
 So what's in the cup, order it up
 Who am I drinking tonight?

 You might not have guessed 
 Judging by my heels and lacy dress
 I'm a Wynette, Gretchen, Loretta Lynn
 I've learned from the best

 Women like that know how to throw a few back
 We gotta have a man who can keep up with all that

 Are you a Kenny tequila, Buffet margarita
 Or an Alan Jackson hurricane?
 Are you a good time, flask of moonshine
 Going George Strait to my brain?
 A girl can tell a lot about a boy in one shot
 I gotta know you've got a Bocephus side
 So what's in the cup, order it up
 Who am I drinking tonight?

 Oh yeah

 So pick your poison and make it two
 What kinda trouble are we gettin' into?

 Are you a Kenny tequila, Buffet margarita
 Or an Alan Jackson hurricane?
 Are you a good time, flask of moonshine
 Going George Strait to my brain?
 A girl can tell a lot about a boy in one shot
 I gotta know you've got a Bocephus side
 So what's in the cup, order it up
 Who am I drinking?
 Another round, throwing 'em down
 Boy, what ya thinking?
 What's in the cup, order it up
 Who am I drinking tonight?

 Oh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Smiley.
