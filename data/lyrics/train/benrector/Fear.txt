Spent ten years on this pavement
And I finally caught a dream
If I'm honest it's a terrifying thing
Cause' I feel crazy taking pictures,
Hear a thousand people scream,
This is a lot for an Oklahoma kid like me

Chase me down outside of Georgia
I was sure that I was done
Something in me would not turn around and run

I heard the lord in California
I remember who I was and I learned to dance
With the fear that I'd been running from

I've been scared to death of failing
Scared that I'd look like a fool
And I'd rather quit than risk that I could lose
Now I'm not proud of that position
But it's the hand that I've been dealt
And as far as I'm concerned that hand can go to hell

Chase me down outside of Georgia
I was sure that I was done
Something in me would not turn around and run
Heard the lord in California
I remember who I was and I learned to dance
With the fear that I'd been running from oh oh yeah

No I won't run away oh oh oh oh
No I am not afraid oh oh oh oh

I was down outside of Georgia so sure that I was done
But something in me would not turn around and run

Heard the lord in California
And I remember who I was and I learned to dance
With the fear that I'd been running from
Learned to dance with the fear that I'd been running from---
