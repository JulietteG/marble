Well call me crazy or you can call me anytime you want
Or call me maybe cuz I kinda love that song
Be my Madonna or Steven Tyler in my dreams
Cuz when I'm with you yea, well I don't wanna miss a thing

I can't help but turnin you up
And I can't seem to be gettin enough well
Time after time I hit rewind

When I'm woe you turn me on just like
The radio with every single note
I'm wild and young and free and loud sayin
Don't stop and leave your windows down
Well I can't help but sing along
Cuz you feel like my favorite song yeah
You feel like my favorite song

You could be my all star just like smash mouth
Said you were circus summer maybe 1994 (99)
Be john Bon jovi or cool like Johnny Cash used to
Living on a prayer singing the fulsome prison blues

I can't help but turnin you up
And I can't seem to be gettin enough well
Time after time I hit rewind

When I'm woe you turn me on just like
The radio with every single note
I'm wild and young and free and loud sayin
Don't stop and leave your windows down
Well I can't help but sing along
Cuz you feel like my favorite song yeah
You feel like my favorite song

Oh and you keep spinning round in my head
And when it's over play it again and again
And I know ever leave and oh my heart
Cuz you feel just like my favorite song

Ooh turn me on just like the radio
With every single note
I'm wild and young and free and loud saying
Don't stop and leave your windows down
Well I can't help but sing along
Cuz you feel like my favorite song yeah
You feel like my favorite song
You feel like my favorite song---
