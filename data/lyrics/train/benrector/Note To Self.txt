Note to self: clean the living room,
Do the things you dont want to do,
Maybe fold that week old pile of clothes
Note to self: get some exercise
Feels bad and you have to try
But as far as I can tell thats how life goes

And note to self: dont let yourself worry quite as much,
Itll end up fine enough
It always has up until now,
Something else,
You should think of other people a little more,
You shoulda thought of that before
Cause of everything youve written down
This is the first note that you wrote for someone else
Note to self

Note to self: keep choosing her
Cause she is yours and wonderful
And for-ever is a long time to be sad,
And one more thing;
Call your mother back
Talk for too long its probably half
Of what shed like,
But shes the only mother that you have

I dont know how long I have to keep reminding myself
To be who I want to be and not somebody else,
I just thought by now Id figure out the who and how I want to be
Cause I still let myself worry way too much
And it ends up fine enough
It always has and does still now,
And I still need to think of other people
Yes Ive thought of that before
Maybe one day Ill figure out
You dont find peace
Until you love somebody else,
You dont peace
Until you love somebody else
Note to self---
