There are days when I wake up
I don't know what I'm doin' here
I've been recognized
Pair of eyes
Staring back at me in the mirror

There was a day when I was free
Not a care that I could see
So good that I barely could believe that it was happenin'
Oh take me back again

I was sixteen with an open heart
Windows down in a beat up car
When I was dumb and the world was young
And she was beautiful
She was beautiful
She was beautiful

How do we end up like this
Livin' lives that we don't care about
Too busy fixin' things 
On computer screens
While the grass grows green 
Me I'm screamin' out

There was a day when I was free
Not a care that I could see
So good that I barely could believe that it was happenin'
Oh take me back again

Oh, I was sixteen with an open heart
Windows down in a beat up car
When I was dumb and the world was young
And she was beautiful
She was beautiful
She was beautiful
She was beautiful
She was beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

There was a day when I was free
Not a care that I could see
So good that I barely could believe that it was happenin'
Oh take me back again

I was sixteen with an open heart
Windows down in a beat up car
When I was dumb and the world was young
The world was young

And she was beautiful
She was beautiful
It was you
It was you
And you were beautiful yeah

When I was dumb and the world was young
And she was beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Michelle Putlak.
