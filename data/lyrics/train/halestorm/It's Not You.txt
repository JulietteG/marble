I'm in love with somebody
Found someone who completes me
I'm in love with somebody
Oh yeah, and it's not you

Verse:
Feel my finger whatcha gonna do
See these lips are all done talking to you
I don't mean to bruise your ego
But I've had you nailed down for so long 
I don't see your name on my tattoo
Help me understand 
Its been a long time coming
Its for the best
No offense

Chorus:
I'm in love with somebody
Found someone who completes me
I'm in love with somebody
Oh yeah, and it's not you

Verse:
I know who you think you are
Sorry I've turned you on 
But now I'm kissing you off
Nights are whiskey and cigarettes
Not enough to make me forget 
I've got someone who has raised the bar
I've heard it all before
Stop spinnin your wheels
Showin you the door
No hard feelings

Chorus
I'm in love with somebody
Found someone who completes me
I'm in love with somebody 
Oh yeah, and its not you

Bridge
You've probably never been shot down before
(echo)
I'll try to make it easier

Chorus:
I'm in love with somebody
Found someone who completes me
I'm in love with somebody 
Oh yeah, and its not you---Lyrics submitted by Lindsey.
