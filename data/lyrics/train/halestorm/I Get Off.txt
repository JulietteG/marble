You don't know that I know, 
You watch me every night 
And I just can't resist the urge 
To stand here in the light 
Your greedy eyes upon me 
And then I come undone 
And I could close the curtains 
But this is too much fun 

[Chorus] 

I get off on you 
Getting off on me 
I give you what you want 
But nothing is for free 
It's all give and take 
Kinda life we make 
When your line is crossed 
I get off 
I get off 

So much left unspoken 
Between the two of us 
It's so much more exciting 
To look when you can't touch 
You could say I am different 
And maybe I'm a freak 
But I know how to twist ya 
To bring you to your knees 

[Chorus] 

I get off on you 
Getting off on me 
I give you what you want 
But nothing is for free 
It's all give and take 
Kinda life we make 
When your line is crossed 
I get off 
I get off 

But you don't know 
What you can't see 
Is what I do for you 
I do for me 

[Bridge] 

I get off on you 
Getting off on me 
I give you what you want 
Yeaaaaaaah... 

[Chorus] 

I get off on you 
Getting off on me 
I give you what you want 
But nothing is for free 
It's all give and take 
Kinda life we make 
When your line is crossed 
I get off 
I get off 

Yeaah .... I get off 
Yeaah .... I get off 
I get off!!---Lyrics submitted by brant.
