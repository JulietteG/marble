Dont listen what your girlfriends says
she reads those magazines
lets say you failed the test
you dont have what she needs

I slither like a viper
and get you by the neck
i know a thousand ways to help you forget about her
that bitch can eat her heart out

love bites
but so do I, so do I

love bites
but so do I, so do I
Love Bites!

my lips are pale and vicious
youre foaming at the mouth
youve suffered in the darkness
i'll suck the pain right out

so come and taste the reason
im nothing like the rest
i'll kiss you anyway you'll never forget about me
that chick can eat her heart out

love bites
but so do I, so do I

love bites
but so do I, so do I, so do I

It checks you in and kicks you down
It chews you up and spits you out
It messes with your sanity
by twisting all your thoughts around

They say its blind
They say it waits
but every time it seals your fate
now its got you by the balls
it wont let go until you fall

I was down and i got up
i said hey love i've had enough
I've felt pleasure without pain
My soul you'll never Tame!!! 

love bites, but so do i

love bites
but so do I, so do I

love bites
but so do I, so do I, so do I

love bites
but so do I, so do I
Love bites!!
Love bites!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Ethan Fonte.
