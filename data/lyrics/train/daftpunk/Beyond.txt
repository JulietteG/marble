Dream, beyond dreams
Beyond life you will find your song
Before sound, to be found close your eyes
Then rise, higher still, endless thrill
To the land of love beyond love
Come alive and you'll find
Forever watching you arrive

You are the night, you are the ocean
You are the light behind the cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed
There's no such thing as competition
To find a way we lose control
Remember, love's our only mission...
This is the journey of the soul
The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
You hold your promise long forgotten,
It is the birthplace of your dreams---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
