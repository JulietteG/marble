Coming from the streets
Fists up in the air
Generating heat
They come from everywhere
Hail

Fists are made of iron
Bodies made of steel
Dancing on the razor
Metal is the deal
Hail

We came to feel the thunder
The lightning and the heat
We came to hail the metal gods
Banging to the beat, singing

Hail, to the metal, hail
Singing, "Hail heavy metal"
Hail

The power in the music
Arising in us all
We're never gonna lose it
We're proud and standing tall
Hail, I said, "Hail"

If you just cannot feel it
You'll never understand
There's nothing's gonna beat it
Metal rules the land
Hail

We come to feel the thunder
The lightning and the heat
We came to hail the metal gods
Banging to the beat, singing

Hail to the metal, hail
Singing, "Hail heavy metal"
Hail, hail

Hail heavy metal, hail
Hail heavy metal, hail
Hail heavy metal, hail
Hail to the metal
Heavy metal, hail

Hail to the metal
Heavy metal, all hail
Hail to the metal
Heavy metal all hail

Hail to the metal
Heavy metal, all hail
Hail to the metal
Heavy metal, all hail---Lyrics submitted by Javier.
