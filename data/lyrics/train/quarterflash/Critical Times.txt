All the trouble Ill make through the things Ill do
They keep catching up with me, fate usually runs true
I dont always know when Im right but I sure know when Im wrong
Im feeling self-pity and yet still writing sad stupid songs
Shed say to me

Say what you want - Do what you say
These are critical times - Love is fading away
We can go through the tops and we can live through these games
It never changes how it feels when your love is fading away

You lose all track of yourself when youre feeling that way
You can always hide yourself in corners worried about all the miserable pain
But everyone seems to swim in it, it makes the world go round
Im somewhere floundering feeling like Ive been drowned

So I say what I want and I do what I say
These are critical times - Love is fading away
I can go through the tops and I can live through these games
It never changes how it feels when your love is fading

I dont believe in much and I never gave you time
To tell anybody how Im willing to give to them all my life
I dont believe it  she has the look there in her eyes
Shes tryin to get through to me - Shes gonna stick this out one last time

So youre cruisin down the road of life, should be feelin strong
You never had the feelin yet and it always leaves you all wrong
Youre best when you grab hold of yourself since you know youre gonna fall
You can check out on me anytime that you like
Love is bittersweet thats all

So we say what we want and we do what we say
These are critical times - Love is fading away
We can go through the tops and we can live through these games
It never changes how it feels when your love is fading

So go and say what you want and do what you say
These are critical times - Love is fading away
We can go through the tops and we can live through these games
It never changes how it feels when your love is fading---Lyrics submitted by Bob.
