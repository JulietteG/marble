There once was a boy who stole a toy
From a bin at the five and dime
It wasn't too long before he knew it was wrong
And lamented deep down his dark crime
He suffered in silence, ashamed of himself
Afraid of the wrath of God
He was convinced he was heading for hell
And a life behind bars on this sod
Then his mama came into his room full of fears
And her eyes said it's time for a chat
He made his confession in sorrow and tears
As she held him so close on her lap
Then swore she heard angels clap
And she said to him

(Chorus) There's nothing so bad you can't confide in me, love
No heartache or lasting regret
There's nothing so sad that you've tried to be free of
That I won't forgive and forget
Because I love. I do
Oh, I love you, it's true
Yes, I love you. I do. I bet.

One rainy morn before a baby was born
A wife of five years fell apart
Through sobs that just choked, a dam finally broke
She told her husband the ache of her heart
Before I met you, when I was in school
I fell mighty hard for this guy
He was trouble, I knew
Friends called me a fool
But I wouldn't let go of the lie
When we finally broke up I was three months along
Afraid and ashamed and confused
I borrowed some money
I know it was wrong
But I couldn't see clear what to do
God knows I'm so sorry, do you?
Then he said to her

Chorus

Most of our life we bleed from a knife
That cuts from the inside out
We push down the lid, keep the scars hid
And act like we haven't a doubt
But now and again a memory slips in
Of a moment that filled us with shame
When we could've and should've in retrospect would've 
But don't, and that's really quite plain
Somewhere on the journey we need to get quiet
And turn off the comfort of noise
Confess what we've done and not try to deny it
To the Maker of all girls and boys
Then hear Him say as the angels rejoice
