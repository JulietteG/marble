You are the strength when I am weak
You are the treasure that I seek
You are my all in all
                       2
Seeking You as a precious jewel
Lord to give up I'd be a fool
You are my all in all
                       3
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
Rising again I bless your name
you are my all in all
                   4
When I fall down you pick me up
When I am dry you  Fill my cup
you are my all in all

chorus:
Jesus lamb of God,
 worthy is Your name(x2)
                          1
you  are my strength when i am weak
you are the treasure that I seek
you are my all in all
                         2
Seeking you as a precious jewel
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool
you my all in all
