On a cold winter night 
'Neath the silvery moon
I wished on a star
I had a dream about you.
Dry the tears from your eyes
I'll be coming home soon
'Neath the wide open skies
Where the bluebonnets bloom.

Like a blanket spreading out as far as I can see
When those flowers line the road
You can look for me.
I'll be hanging round your back door like an old familiar tune
I'll be there when the bluebonnets bloom.

Some people can go to the top of the world
I'd rather be home with my bluebonnet girl
Cause she needs me like a bride needs a groom
I'll be making her mine when the bluebonnets bloom.

Like a blanket spreading out as far as I can see
When those flowers line the road
You can look for me
I'll be hanging round your back door like an old familiar tune
I'll be there when the bluebonnets
I'll be coming home you can bet on it
I'll be there when the bluebonnets bloom.---Lyrics submitted by Pam Jopson.
