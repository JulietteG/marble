Something told me that it was over, baby, yeah
When I saw you
When I saw you and that girl
And y'all was talking

Something deep down
Something deep down in my soul said
"Go on, go on and cry, girl"
When I saw you, when I saw you with that same person
And y'all was walking around

And I'd rather
I'd rather be a blind girl, baby, yeah, yeah
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, baby
Don't leave me, I don't wanna see you go

'Cause you see, I love you so much
And I don't wanna watch you leave me
Don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
And another thing is, one more thing is
I just don't, I just don't wanna be free
Scared to be by myself

I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
About your sweet kiss and your, your warm embrace
Hmm, your warm embrace
Hmm, yo, yo, warm, warm embrace

When I look down in the glass that I held to my lips
And I saw the reflection of the tears rolling down my face
That's when I knew I love you and I couldn't do without you
And I'd rather be a blind girl

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, babe, no, babe, oh, oh
Oh babe, all day sitting up
Sitting up thinking about you

Myself, I don't wanna see you leave
Please don't go
Oh, babe, no, babe, oh, babe
I'd rather be a blind girl

Something told me that it was over, baby
When I saw you
When I saw you and that girl
And y'all was talking

Something deep down in my soul said
"Go on, go on and cry, girl"
When I saw you, when I saw you and that girl
And y'all was walking by

And I'd rather go blind, I'd rather go blind
I'd rather go blind, babe
Than to see you walk away, walk away
Don't walk away 'cause I'd rather go blind---
