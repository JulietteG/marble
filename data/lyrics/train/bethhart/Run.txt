behind the church and down the hill
under the cross where time's standing still
paying dues for your troubled mind
trying to lose what you fought to find

sooner or later you're gonna hear a sound
that holds you and lifts you
picks you back off the ground
open your eyes and close your back door
there is a sign on top of your shoulder, telling

shake them down shake them down shake them down yeah
hey old man thanks for coming around 
break it down break it down break it down yeah
be still for the peace to be found
run run run
dedl dum dedl day em day
dedl dum dedl dem dum em day

sooner or later you're gonna hear a sound
that holds you and lifts you
picks you back off the ground
open your eyes and close your back door
there is a sign on top of your shoulder, telling

shake them down shake them down shake them down yeah
hey old man thanks for coming around
break it down break it down break it down yeah
countless voices calling
fears are answering the pain
myths and legends ending in your mind
moving 'round again moving 'round again
moving 'round moving 'round moving 'round again
shake them down yeah---Lyrics submitted by Carol.
