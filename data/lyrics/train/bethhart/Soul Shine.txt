When you cant find the light
That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars aint shinin' bright
You feel like you've lost youre way
When the candle lights of home
Burn so very far away
Well you got to let your Soul shine
Just like my mamma used to say

She used to say soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
And if the people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
You got to let your soul shine
Shine to the break of day

Growing up I thought that I had it made
I could make it on my own
But life can take the strongest man
Make him feel so alone
Now sometimes I feel a cold wind
Blowin through my achin bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said girl, in the darkest before the dawn

Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshne
Damn sure better than rain
If the people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
You got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day

Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
Like a woman has shot down to spear soul
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this
And when your world seems cold
You got to let your spirit take control

Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Lord now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
You got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day

Oh, it's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshne
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
You got to let your soul shine
Shine through the break of day---Lyrics submitted by tineke.
