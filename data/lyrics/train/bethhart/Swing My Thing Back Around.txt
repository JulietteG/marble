Why have a song if you aint gonna sing?
Make a move, do your thing
It dont really matter if youre out of tone
So enjoy yourself all afternoon

Im putting my foot down
I swing my thing back around
And play my favorite tune
That weve begun, that I know

Wipe up the shoes if you aint gonna dance
Free your mind, take a chance
What are you doing? Just hanging around
Show your hip  go down town

Im putting my foot down
I swing my thing back around
And play my favorite tune
That weve begun, that I know

Ill bet you sooner than later
Head out in of the sand
Stop lying in the ghetto
Sipping whiskey with my crackers and spill

Why wear the ring if it aint gonna shine
Tell your man youre worth doing
Why ever hide it? It aint gonna buzz
Kiss and hide in fear his love

Im putting my foot down
And swing my thing back a..
Im putting my foot down
And switch this hit back a..
And blame my own damn tone
Though really that man I know---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
