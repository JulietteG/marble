Heaven don't want me
Heaven don't fool me
No one will understand
And it's alright - yeah...

I'm feelin' these changes
Everybody is strangers
No one will give a damn
And I guess that's life

You say, you got a feelin'
You figured out the writing on the wall
And angels on the ceiling
Don't come to you, when you call

You found your own religion
And searched your heart, for somethin' more
Still naked in the kitchen
Tryin' to wipe yourself off, of the floor

No, I won't take you for granted
These broken arms, can hold you
No, I won't take you for granted...

You say, it don't matter
I'm livin' loud, I'm livin' long
And hear the phony laughter
Echoing on and on

I'm hiding under water
I pray to God, wash me away
Can't hear the child's wonder
My innocence got hushed, along the way 

Now you say, Now you sayin'...
No, I won't take you for granted
These broken arms, can hold you
No, I won't take you for granted

No I won't leave you abandoned
This broken heart can love you still
No I won't take you for granted

And you dont' say a word
But inside i know
You don't say that it hurts
And tonight killed slow
All the love in the world
Won't let you let go...
let you, lettin' go now-alright...

And hold on, your soul will rise again
I know that it will
And hold on, your soul will rise again
I know that it will
And hold on, your soul will rise again
I know that it will

Maybe heaven will want me
Maybe heaven won't fool me
Maybe someone will give a damn
And have a life

You say you got a...a fellin'-all night...---Lyrics submitted by Caitlin McCall.
