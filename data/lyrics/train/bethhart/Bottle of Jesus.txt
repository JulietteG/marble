I got my wine, and cigarettes
These twenty cents, is all I got left 
Don't bother me, I'm trying to swim 
I guess, I'll lay around all day 
Sit back and smile, just fade away
A drunk yard dog, is what I am 

[Chorus]
Break out, the bottle of Jesus 
Plug in, the black light rosary (rosary)
And somebody's waiting to save me, yeah

I know my neighbours, wish I'd die 
I'm much too loud, when I get high 
I think, I'll send around some pie 
I'll spike that dish, with a touch of herb 
It'll numb their lips, and soothe their nerves 
I'll build my kingdom, on the curb 

[Chorus]
Break out, the bottle of Jesus 
Plug in, the black light rosary (rosary)
And somebody's waiting to save me, yeah

Be it the rain, or shine 
I'll get a high, like summertime
It's an All-Americana party time 
Tell that landlord man
I'll kick that bastard, like a can 
It's an All-Americana party time

And I don't listen, to rules or gospel 
They're just trying, to shut me up
Call me the master, of "ole misfortune 
A weasel, a weaselin' away
Dear Lord - hold the sight
Oh Lord - gonna set me free

[Chorus]
Break out, the bottle of Jesus (break out the bottle)
Plug in, the black light rosary (rosary)
And somebody's waiting to save me (all right)

[Chorus]
Break out, the bottle of Jesus (break out the bottle)
Plug in, the black light rosary (rosary)
And somebody's waiting to save me

And somebody's waiting to save me
And somebody's waiting - somebody waiting
Americana party time
An Americana party time
An Americana party time - time - time---Lyrics submitted by jenifer.
