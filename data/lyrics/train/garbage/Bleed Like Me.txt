Avalanche is sullen and too thin
She starves herself to rid herself of sin
And the kick is so divine 
When she sees bones beneath her skin
And she says

Hey baby can you bleed like me? 
Oh come on baby can you bleed like me?

Chris is all dressed up and acting coy
Painted like a brand new Christmas toy
He trying to figure out 
If hes a girl or hes a boy
And he says

Hey baby can you bleed like me? 
Oh come on baby can you bleed like me?

Dittle takes bright scissors to her skin
And when she does relief comes seeping in
While she hides the scars she making
Underneath her pretty clothes
And she sings


Hey baby can you bleed like me? 
Oh come on baby can you bleed like me?

Therapy is Sweeties brand new drug
Dancing with the devils past has never been too fun
Its better off then trying
To take a bullet from a gun
And she cries

Hey baby can you bleed like me? 
Oh come on baby can you bleed like me?

JT gets all fucked up in some karaoke bar
After 2 drinks hes a loser
After 3 drinks hes a star
Getting all nostalgic as he sings 
I will survive

Hey baby can you bleed like me? 
Oh come on baby can you bleed like me?
Hey baby can you bleed like me? 
Oh come on baby can you bleed like me?

You should see my scars
You should see my scars
You should see my scars
You should see my scars

Try to comprehend that which youll never comprehend
Try to comprehend that which youll never comprehend
Just try to comprehend that which youll never comprehend
Try to comprehend that which youll never comprehend

You should see my scars
You should see my scars---Lyrics submitted by elinore.
