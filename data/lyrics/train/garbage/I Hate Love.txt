Your words are pretty but I already know who you are. 
We knew you before you met me, long before we were part. 
Before you tricked me and laid on my bones. 
Before you kissed me and buried my hope. 
Before you stole my spirit, and load the show into the wall. 

Show your world, 
they lay all their dreams on you. 
They let you in and you start to believe yourself, as a miracle. 
On front, I was on you on front. 
Innocent and open as any lamb, and hoping for paradise. 

I hate love 
And I hate love 
So I hate love 
Yeah, I hate love 

Love makes you desperate, 
and feeling a fool. 
Love makes you ruthless, 
and love makes you cruel, 
and love makes you crazy, 
with nothing but lies. 
Love promises nothing, 
and then your love dies 

On front, I was on you on front 
Innocent and open as any lamb, 
and hoping for paradise. 

I hate love 
And I hate love 
So I hate love 
Yeah, I hate love 

[Hey it's me] 
[Call me] 
Then your love dies 
[here I am] 
[where are you?] 
Then your love dies 
[where are you?] 
Then your love dies 
[can you call me?] 
[can you call me back?]---
