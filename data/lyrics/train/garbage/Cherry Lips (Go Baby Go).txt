She gave you everything she had
But she was young and dumb
She just turned 21
She didnt care to hang around
So when the shit came down
Why she was nowhere to be found
This life can bend a good girl bad
She was the sweetest thing 
That you had ever seen

Youre such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide 
In physical terms

With your cherry lips and golden curls
You could make grown men gasp 
When you go walking past them
In your hot pants and high heels
They could not believe
That such a body was for real

It seemed like rainbows would appear
Whenever you came near
The clouds would disappear
Because you look just like a girl
Your baby blues would flash
And suddenly a spell was cast

Youre such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide 
In physical terms

You hold the candle in your heart 
You shine the light on hidden parts
You make the whole world want to dance
You bought yourself a second chance

Go baby go go
Were right behind you
Go baby go go
Yeah were looking at you
Go baby go go
Oh were right behind you
Go baby go baby
Yeah were right behind you

Go baby go baby
Oh were right behind you
Go baby go baby
Yeah were looking at you
Go baby go baby
Oh were right behind you
Go baby go baby
Yeah were looking at you

You hold the candle in your heart
Go baby go go
You shine the light on hidden parts
Go baby go go
You make the whole world want to dance
Go baby go go
You bought yourself a second chance
Go baby go baby go

Delicate boy
Go baby go baby go
In the hysterical realm
Go baby go baby go
Of an emotional landslide
Go baby go baby go
In physical terms
Go baby go go

Go 
Yeah were looking at you
Go baby go go
Oh were right behind you---Lyrics submitted by Al Martinez.
