She shot you down like an animal
Give it up, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wanna live your life like a Romeo
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Hush, don't you cry
Live and let die
Spread out your wings and fly

Try to keep your feet on the patio
Give it up, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Wanna show Perrineau your Mercutio
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Hush, don't you cry
Live and let die
Spread out your wings and fly

Cause the strong shall thrive 
While the weak will all perish
Only those fit survive

You gotta live by the game
You gotta live by the rules
You gotta know your means and your moves 
You gotta keep up your guard
You gotta hit quick and hard
You gotta know when to hold or fold your cards

We'll hook you up with an enema
Give it up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And don't stop till you get enough---Lyrics submitted by Henry.
