I stand here crying out your name
I stand here crying out your name
I stand here crying, whats the difference?

I stand here crying in the rain
I stand here crying in the rain
I stand here crying, whats the difference?

But not me
But not me
But not me
But not me

I stand here crying out your name
I stand here crying out your name
I stand here crying, whats the difference?

I stand here crying in the rain
I stand here crying in the rain
I stand here crying, whats the difference?

But not me
But not me
But not me
But not me

When you held your arms around me
I felt free and said can this be
And then you left me feeling better

But not me
But not me
But not me
But not me

But not me
But not me
But not me
But not me---Lyrics submitted by Seras.
