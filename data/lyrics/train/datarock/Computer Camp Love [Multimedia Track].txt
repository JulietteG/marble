[ ]= Tiny voices

I ran into her on computer camp
[Was that in 84?]
Not sure
I had my commodore 64
Had to score
[Not with that tutor tramp]
She's not a tramp
Her name is Judy
[That's a nice name]
Yeah she's a nice girl
[Big deal
Did you get in her pants]
She's not that kind of a girl booger
[Why, does she have a penis]
Seen as supremus
You better know she's a genus and a Venus
[Tell me more was it love at first sight]
That's right this was god given grace with a face you could praise
[Tell me more did you put up a fight]
I dont think so but before we tour the chorus stall let's all explore a more a
[Computer cabin war]
That's right
I said before we explore the amore on my story do a dora
[Computer cabin war]
Seen as supremus
You better know shes a genus and a Venus
[Tell me more was it love at first sight]
Thats right this was god giving grace with a face you could praise
[Tell me more did you put up a fight...]

I ran into her on computer camp
[Computer cabin war]
Hard core
It started like a boar ending up on the floor
[Come on now tell me more]
Seen as supremus
You better know shes a genus and a Venus
[Tell me more was it love at first sight]
Thats right this was god giving grace with a face you could praise
[Tell me more did you put up a fight...]---Lyrics submitted by Seras.
