You only live twice 
Tomorrow never dies 
Youll only live twice 
If you live through the night 

Come take a ride to where dreams are made up 
Take a ride to where nothings played up 
Come take a ride to where dreams are made up, played up, payed up 
Hit us with those laser beams 

You dont know where youre going? 
Dont know what youre gonna do? 
Hear how its blowing? 
This is the sound of the underground 

Do you live for tomorrow? 
Do you live for the night? 
Hear how its growing? 
This is the sound of the underground 

Youre going out, the city will inspire you 
To dance to the sound of the underground 
Youre going out, theres nothing that you cant do 
So dance to the sound of the underground 

Know where youre going 
Know what you gotta do 
Hear how its blowing? 
This is the sound of the underground 

Live for tomorrow 
Live for the night 
Hear how its growing? 
This is the sound of the underground 

Youre going out, the city will inspire you 
To dance to the sound of the underground 
Youre going out, theres nothing that you cant do 
Ao dance to the sound of the underground 

Youre going out, if you really wanna make it through 
Just dance to the sound of the underground 
Youre going out, its gonna make you feel brand new 
So dance to the sound of the underground 

All wrong, all wrong, all wrong, all wrong, alright 
Get your body on the floor tonight 
All wrong, all wrong, all wrong, all wrong, alright 
Get your body on the dance floor tonight 

Dance to the sound of the underground 
Dance till the worlds spinning round and round 

Youre going out, and you better let it show 
So dance to the sound of the underground 
Youre going out, and you want the world to know 
So dance to the sound of the underground---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
