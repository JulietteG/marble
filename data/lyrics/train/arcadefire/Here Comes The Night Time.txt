When the sun goes down,
When the sun goes down you head inside
Because the lights don't work,
Nothing works but you don't mind

Here comes the night time

The missionaries tell us we will be left behind
Been left behind a thousand times, a thousand times
If you want to be righteous, if you want to be righteous
Get in line
Here comes the night time

Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time
Now here comes the night
Here comes the night
Look out here comes the night time

They say heaven's a place, yeah heaven's a place
And they know where it is,
But you know where it is?
It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
When they hear the beat coming from the street the lock the door,
If there's no music up in heaven then what's it for?
When I hear the beat, my spirit's on like a live wire
A thousand horses running wild in a city on fire
It starts in your feet, then it goes to your head
And if you can feel it, then the rules are dead
And if you're the judge, then what is our crime?
Here comes the night time.

Now the preachers they talk
[?]
If you're looking for hell, just try looking inside

When you look in the sky, just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
Here comes the night time ---
