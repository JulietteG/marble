Sleeping is giving in, no matter what the time is. sleeping is giving
in, so lift those heavy eyelids.
people say that you'll die faster than without water. but we know it's
just a lie, scare your son and scare your daughter.
people say that your dreams are the only things that save ya.
come on baby in our dreams, we can live our misbehaviour.
everytime you close your eyes lies, lies!
people try and hide the night underneath the covers.
people try and hide the light underneath the covers.
come on hide your lovers underneath the covers.
come on hide your lovers underneath the covers.
hidin' from your brothers underneath the covers, come on hide your
lovers underneath the covers.
people say that you'll die faster than without water, but we know it's
just a lie, scare your son, scare your daughter
now here's the sun, it's alright! now here's the moon, it's alright!
now here's the sun, it's alright! now here's the moon, it's alright!
but everytime you close your eyes, lies!---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
