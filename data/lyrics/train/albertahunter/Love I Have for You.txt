The love I have for you
makes my burdens light.
The love I have for you
makes my blue days bright.
Asleep or awake dear
your face I see,
your sunshine and smile is a guide for me.

The love I have for you
is within my heart.
The love I have for you
is a thing set apart.
You can search the universe,
but my dear if you do,
youll never find a love like the love I have for you.

I never fret a worry.
At no time am I blue.
I spend my days rejoicing
because of the love that I have for you.

You can search this universe
but my dear if you do
youll never find a love like the love I have for you.---Lyrics submitted by Paul Secord.
