Most folks now days say old fashioned ways
Should give place to things that are new.
But somehow I hold, to things that are old
Perhaps its an old fashioned view.
I love my old books, the corners and nooks
of my old home and the old friends.
Old memories too, one love that is true
Lasting all through life until it ends.

Ive got that old fashioned love in my heart
Oh - - play it for me - - yes
And there it will always remain
My love is like and ivy vine
Clingin a little closer all the time
Through the years, joy and tears.
Just the same.

Ive got that old fashioned faith in my heart.
No changes cant tear it apart.
If the dry land changed to sea.
That wouldnt make any change in me.
Cuz Ive got that old old fashioned love in my heart.

Yes Ive got that old old fashioned faith in my heart .
No changes cant tear it apart.
If the dry land changed to sea.
That would never make any change in me.
Cuz Ive got that old old fashioned love in my heart.

Yes, Ive got that old old fashioned love in my heart.---Lyrics submitted by Paul Secord.
