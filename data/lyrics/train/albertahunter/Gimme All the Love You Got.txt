Gimme all your love daddy or let me be
this half way stuff aint going for me.
Ah, gimme all the love you got,
else youre gona make me hot.
I just must have it, so gimme every bit you got.

You know I dont stand no fluff and so
I dont want none if I cant get it all.
Gimme all the love you got,
else youre gona make me hot.
I say I want your lovin, so gimme every bit you got.

If I get too greedy, just call my hand.
But you cant gimme any more than I can stand.
Cuz I want all you got, cuz I can stand an awful lot.
I want your lovin, so gimme every bit you got.

Oh you know Im built for comfort, Ive got lots of speed.
But daddy dont ask me how much I need.
Cuz Ill take every bit youve got, I can stand an awful lot
I want your lovin, so gimme every bit you got.

Oh, just like a ground hog loved his hole.
I love you if you can satisfy my soul. 
Gimme all the love you got; wither its enough of not.
Oh, I want you daddy, so gimme every bit you got.

Oh, love me pappa and treat me rough.
Looks like I just cant get enough.
Cuz I want all you got; wither its enough of not.
I got to have your lovin, so gimme every bit you got.

Just gona keep you right here by my side.
Till I feel Ive been satisfied.
Daddy I say I want all you got,
else youre gona make me hot.
I got to have your lovin, so gimme every bit you got.

You know a little bit only makes me mad.
So gimme all cuz its just too bad.
I want all you got, thats the only way to touch the spot.
I want your lovin, so gimme every bit you got.---Lyrics submitted by Paul Secord.
