So glad we made it through the water bane
God gave us land
So hard with contortion lately
I know your understand

A million die and no one really ever knows
Disappear before the Son will ever come

Hey,
Don't be crazed
'Cause in a way
We're getting away with everything

All skies are on the risk of breaking
They barely rain
These nights of distortion facing
How there all the same

A million die and no one really ever knows
We walk for miles before the Son will ever glow

Hey,
Don't be crazed
'Cause in a way
We're getting away with everything x2

I was thinking to myself this was a beautiful life x2

Hey,
Don't be crazed
'Cause in a way
We're getting away with everything x2

We're getting away with everything

Don't be crazed, Don't be crazed

Getting away with everything,
Everything x3---
