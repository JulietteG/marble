Out of your mind, out of your mind with whiplash
Out of your legs, out of the art of walking
Under a spell, under an innocent sky
Under this rose, for all this time

Living with the freaks
In this very weird house
On this beautiful street
We're as smart as the young, well

Open yourself, open yourself to strangers
Open the doors, open your door to your party
Give us your bread, we'll give you our full attention
I give you my wine, so glad to be alive

Living with the freaks
In this very weird house
On this beautiful street
We're as smart as the young

We should try to get along
'Cause we may not have to love
In case they come again
I think I'd better stay
Always in my car
Always in the day
Always x3

Living with the freaks
In this very weird house
On this beautiful street
We're as smart as the young

We should try to get along x4

Living with the freaks x3 ---
