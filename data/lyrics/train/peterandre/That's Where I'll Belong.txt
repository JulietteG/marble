I only know that I'll know I'm in love when I'm in it
Wishing you were here today
Don't wanna wait forever
Don't wanna feel this way

When we meet my life's gonna change in a minute
Nothing's gonna be the same
I know I'm gonna find you

Seems to me that I'm not asking much
This is how I feel

All I'm wanting in my life
Someone honest by my side
Someone who'll give me back their heart
Say when I'm wrong and when i'm right
Just somebody to be thinking of
When I'm lonely late at night
And when I find that special one
That's where I'll belong

Not so long ago it was good to be alone I was happy
But now that's not enough for me
I wanna share it all
Only then will I be complete

I been looking but girl I'm gonna try a little harder
'Cause girl I'm gonna find ya
Wherever you may be

All I'm wanting in my life
Someone honest by my side
Someone who'll give me back their heart
Say when I'm wrong and when I'm right
Just somebody to be thinking of
When I'm lonely late at night
And when I find that special one
That's where I'll belong

And when I find that special one
That's where I'll belong
That's where I'll belong...

But I guess my dreams will have to do until I find you
All I'm wanting in my life
Someone honest by my side
Someone who'll give me back their heart
Say when I'm wrong and when I'm right
Just somebody to be thinking of
When I'm lonely late at night
And when I find that special one
That's where I'll belong

And when I find that special one
That's where I'll belong
That's where I'll belong...---Lyrics submitted by Tosan.
