Its the king representing once more, you understand. When people see me on Bankhead man on four star point, yelling screaming and waving. I dont wanna roll over no toes in my Rolls. You just back up let a pimp pass through you dig?

Baby better double arthur burger
Every time I see shorty
Where your head tonight
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena
Shorty live a hell of a life

Im shining in and out of foreign
Cars never boring
Cash steady flowing they got shorty where you goin?
People see me they ask me shorty where you goin?
Partners see me they ask meshorty where you goin?

Shorty goin extra hard when they release his passport
Why I need a credit card what you think this cash for?
Hit the dealership and give them every dime he ask for
Just so I can see 260 on the gas board

Trying to get some luck somebody better get the task force
Love when hoes love me let me fuck em til their ass hoarse.
Pimpin 101 just come and see me take a crash course
You wanna count my money go to college need a math course

On a main dashboard, 100 milligramy
Breakneck speed til I see a billi coming.
Im building jimi hendrix good grumbling in my stomach

Im still stunting off the chain chasing niggas for my money
Pair of poodles ike Im playing gin rummy
No cards just broads when a nigga get hard
Love the offshore autobahn tar like a car star
Put it in her wristwatch
Balling like a big shot

Baby better double arthur burger
Every time I see shorty
Where your head tonight
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena
Shorty live a hell of a life---Lyrics submitted by chantel.
