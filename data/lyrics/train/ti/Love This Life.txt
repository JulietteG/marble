[Intro]
I know it can get kinda tough sometimes you know
I know you can kinda get carried away with yourself
But errr why don't you be real with me and be real with you at the same time
You cant get what you get here no where else ma
Keep it real now

[Chorus]
You know, You know you know you love this
You know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know, you love
You you know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know

[T.I.]
Cavalli dress and high heels
And drop tops on hot wheels
We live how we wanna live cause we got mills
Them other barely barely buy a hot meal
In VIP dem bottle poppin do it B.I.G
Come get with T.I.P be ballin til you d-i-e
A dozen bracelet see clearly
Take away your stress mean that sincerely
Problem solve em, nevermind that
Girlfriend see your bag, be like where you find that?
Plus, whats a whats a prenup you ain't got to sign that
You up take half, Imma make it right back
Imma hustla hustla to the heart
Whats the sense in leaving me and be back with them with-them busters
Bentley for your birthday, Guiliard Purse day
Deal with them stacks know you gotta love that

[Chorus]
You know, You know you know you love this
You know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know, you love
You you know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know

[T.I.]
Man of Respect on a big jet
With a big big and a big check
I pop big sh-t how good does it get
Ya leave me, where else you think you could get this?
Yeah, you could get another guy to beat that beat that for ya
Them busters cowards though, and Ill take a bullet for you
Mansions, jewelry all I need is for you and me to have some understanding
Have a couple candid conversations
Your frustrations I take in consideration
Im rough around the edges, don't bat with me and be patient
And youre sadly mistaken if you think Im into chasing
My heart is RSVP Ive extended an invitation
And don't go wasting your time with what they saying online
Your positions divine, dont believe look around
I got a strong mind and kind heart
With a soft kiss but I love heart

[Chorus]
You know, You know you know you love this
You know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know, you love
You you know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know

[Bridge]
Dont you love this life like I love you
Anything you could ask, do it for you
Drop Jags, Berkin bags, Louboutin heels
Summer homes in Miami, hollywood hills
Vacation in Monaco
On the French Riviera with our feet up
Our lifestyles so rare, you know you ain't going no where

[Chorus]
You know, You know you know you love this
You know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know, you love
You you know you love this life
Dont nobody do you like me
You know ---
