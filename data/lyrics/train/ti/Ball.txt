(feat. Lil Wayne)

[T.I. - Verse 1]
Okay we walk off in this bitch
Ballin in this bitch
Hoppin out of Lambos and Ferraris in this bitch
Poppin bottles with a thick red super model bitch
They may talk a lot of that but they cant do alot of this
Ay, Rico told me turn the lights on
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on
Ima big dawg, got em pissed off
A lot of niggas rapping, aint none this raw
They like, eh look at T.I., ballin in the V.I.
Bunch of bad bitches with a looking like Aaliyah
We just pull up, hop out
Go in, show out
Buy the whole bar, pop bottles go hard

[Hook]
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball
Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball
Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball

I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

[T.I. - Verse 2]
The club full of bad bitches and they came to play
Okay it must be your hair cause it ain't your face
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks girl
You make your way up to my section where its at girl
Okay do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket
Broke nigga looking mad, they just gotta deal with it
Get right hoe, roll a dice hoe
And oyu ain't gotta be a dyke cause you like hoe
But everyday I step behind a wall
I do it big, ride fly, stunt, shine and ball
I got a bunch of money, so come and get it from me
And a bucket full of bottles, buss it open
If you wanna get drunk

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne - Verse 3]
Aint no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Pop that pussy like a gun, pull the trigger
Shake that ass like a salt shaker
I keep a L lit up like an elevator
Bitch shake it like a dog, hop like a frog, ride it like a horse
I throw that dick like darts
Drink all muddy, flag all bloody
Im killin these hoes like that nigga Ted Bundy
Im a good looking rapper, I aint tryna stunt
Ima fire my blunt like Donald Trump
Where you at hoe? Where you at hoe?
Can a nigga stick key up in ya back door
Tunechi

[Hook]

[T.I.]
And do ya thing in slow motion like Soulja Slim
And come around, wipe me down like Boosie dem
That thang up for me, show me that you love me
If its really too much for you you can bring a couple buddies
Everyday I do my thang, big stones and chains
She let me drill all in her mouth, no novacane
Them other broke niggas, all they did was told ya thangs
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs
I like my women fat, ass pretty toes and thing
Long hair don't care as long as none down there
If its manicured I can have fun down there
Take you to whatever club throw some money in the air
