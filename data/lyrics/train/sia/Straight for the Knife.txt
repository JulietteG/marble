Put on my best dress 
I wanted to impress 
I put a little makeup on 
Put a bow in my hair 
Wore pretty underwear 
Hoping you might take it off 
Dont know if you really care 
But Im strapped to my chair 
And it aint cause youre pretty 
You were charming 
Until you saw your chance to kill 
Your chance to make history 

You went straight for the knife 
And I prepared to die 
Your blade, it shines 
Looked me straight in the eye 
You turned the gas on high 
Held the flame alight 
You wonder why I'm scared of fire 
You wonder why you make girls cry 

My mascara a mess 
Harsh words for your princess 
Boy, you and your promises 
If your goal was to love 
You scored an epic miss 
Now you'll just have memories 

You went straight for the knife 
And I prepared to die 
Your blade, it shines 
Looked me straight in the eye 
You turned the gas on high 
Held the flame alight 
You wonder why I'm scared of fire 
You wonder why you make girls cry 

Boy, you draw me back in 
Hungry for your bad loving 
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters 
From hanging on your every word 

You went straight for the knife 
And I prepared to die 
Your blade, it shines 
Looked me straight in the eye 
You turned the gas on high 
Held the flame alight 
You wonder why I'm scared of fire 
You wonder why you make girls cry---
