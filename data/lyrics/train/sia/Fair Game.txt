You terrify me 
Cause youre a man- youre not a boy 
You've got some power 
And I cant treat you like a toy 
The road less...Traveled by a little girl 
You disregard the mess 
While I try to control the world 
Dont leave me 
Stay here and frighten me 
Dont leave me 
Come now enlighten me 
Give me all you got 
Give me your wallet and your watch 
Give me your first born 
Give me the rainbow and the- 
So go on and challenge me 
Take the reigns and the seat 
Watch me squirm baby 
But you are just what I need 
And I've never played a fair game 
Ive always had the upper hand 
But what good is intellect and nerve if 
I cant respect any man 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 

You terrify me 
Weve still not kissed 
And yet Ive cried 
You got too close in 
I pushed and pushed 
Opened your bites 
So I could run run 
And then I did betray the dust 
You saw those teeth marks 
They werent all yours 
You had been trusted to a history 
That had not worked for me 
Into a history from which I could not face 
So go on and shake me 
Shake until I give it up 
When I am in doubt baby 
I know that we could make some love 

So go on challenge me 
Take the reigns and the seat 
Watch me squirm baby 
But youre just what I need 
And I've never played a fair game 
Ive always had the upper hand 
But what good is intellect and nerve if 
I cant respect any man 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 
And I never played a fair game 
Ive always had the upper hand 
But what good is intellect and nerve if 
I cant respect any man 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 

Ive always had the upper hand 
But what good is intellect and nerve if 
I cant respect any man 
I want to play a fair game 
Oh, I want to play a fair game 
I've always had the upper hand 
What good is intellect and nerve if 
I can't respect any man 
I want to play a fair game---
