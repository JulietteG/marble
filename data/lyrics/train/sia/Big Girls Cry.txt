Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love, no time for hate
No drama, no time for games
Tough girl whose soul aches

I'm at home on my own
Check my phone, nothing though
Act busy, order in, pay TV
It's agony

I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking

Tough girl, I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top
Blackouts and airplanes
I still pour you a glass of champagne
Tough girl whose soul aches

I'm at home on my own
Check my phone, nothing though
Act busy, order in, pay TV
It's agony

I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking

I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up alone

I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking---
