Take me down
Im feeling now
And the fire moves on
I admit to go
And I aint ready
But Ill hold steady
Yeah Ill hold you
In my arms, in my arms
In my arms

And Im left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I wont let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle

Stopping a beat
Tears fall to the beat
Smile will draw the pain
Feel the ashtray
And I aint ready
But Ill hold steady
Yeah Ill hold you
In my arms, in my arms
In my arms

And Im left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I wont let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle

My bells help me
Being, feeling 'bout me
They were here down
Carry down road
Its a mine, oh mine
Oh I am blind
Defy the eye of the needle

And Im left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I wont let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle
Eye of the needle
And Im left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I wont let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle ---
