Hey America
Let's turn it up
Let's check out ourselves
'Cause you know
You're never fully dressed without a smile
Though our clothes may be Chanel, Gucci
Your shoe's Crocodile
But baby,
You're never fully dressed without a smile

And if you stand for nothing
You'll fight for love
We got all we need
Got no more
You're never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something
You can't roll out
If it's me you're loving
Then let it go
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

Ready or not
Give all we've got
Yeah, you can't deny
That baby
You're never fully dressed without a smile
Don't sink the boat when you lose hope
I'll keep you alive
But baby
You're never fully dressed without a smile

And if you stand for nothing
You'll fight for love
We got all we need
Got no more
You're never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something
You can't roll out
If it's me you're loving
Then let it go
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

Now look at us
We pick it up
We set it on fire
'Cause you know
You're never fully dressed without a smile
We show it out, we're playing now
We're living the life
But baby
You're never fully dressed without a smile

And if you stand for nothing
You'll fight for love
We got all we need
Got no more
You're never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something
You can't roll out
If it's me you're loving
Then let it go
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

You're never fully dressed without a smile---
