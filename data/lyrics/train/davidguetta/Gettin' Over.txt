All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then - 

There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no getting over you you.

Wish I could spill my world into rivers
Just to have you back again - 

There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no getting over you.
