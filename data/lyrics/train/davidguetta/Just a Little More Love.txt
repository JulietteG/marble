Just a little more love
just a little more peace 
It's all it takes to live a dream 
walk hand in hand
gotta understand
and one day soon
we'll live in harmony 

Repeat it all the time

Just a little more love, just a little more love,  just a litte more love,...
JUST A LITTLE MORE LOVE!---Lyrics submitted by Joan.
