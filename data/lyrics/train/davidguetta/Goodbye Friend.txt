Colours will change
I love every shade of you
Don't lose your faith
Keep walking out you do
Don't you say that wasn't worth
All the pain and all the hurt you're going through
(and) I'll always be with you

Goodbye friend
No, this is not the end
Just go your way
Somewhere we'll meet again
Hold on to the moments we shared
Those are the chances that once you'll be back
Goodbye friend---
