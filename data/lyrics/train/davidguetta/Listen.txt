(feat. John Legend)

Let's hit the road
And away we go
Take a new direction
To a different coast
Maybe we should try and put it on the line
You gotta trust me now
Turn up the radio
Tune out the world and roll with the melody
Baby listen close and open up your mind

Imagine it, anywhere
More than miles
I'll take you there
Know one day from the sky, we'll be as one
Now here we are

All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen

Listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen

Soundtrack in the wind
Like passing violins
I can be your rhythm in the silence
And every time we sing an echo's in the sky
Let me close your eyes
Help you fantasize
Make a kiss our playlist the entire night
Listen to the words and a letter flies

Imagine it, anywhere
More than miles
I'll take you there
Know one day from the sky, we'll be as one
Now here we are

All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen

Listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen

Listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen
All we gotta do is, listen---
