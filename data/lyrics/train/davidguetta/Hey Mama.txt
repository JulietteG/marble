Be my woman girl I'll be your man
Be my woman girl I'll be your man

Yes I be your woman 
Yes I be your baby 
Yes I be whatever that you tell me when you ready 
Yes I be your girl, forever your lady 
You ain't never gotta worry, I'm down for you baby 

Best believe that when you need that 
Ill provide that you will always have it 
I be on deck, keep it in check 
When you need that, I'mma let you have it 

Beating my drum like dum di di dey 
I like the dirty rhythm you play 
I wanna hear you calling my name 
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama 
Banging the drum like dum di di dey 
I know you want it in the worst way 
I wanna hear you calling my name 
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama 

Be my woman girl I'll be your man
Be my woman girl I'll be your man

Yes I do the cooking 
Yes I do the cleaning 
Yes I keep the na-na real sweet for your eating 
Yes you be the boss and yes I be respecting 
Whatever that you tell me cause its the game you be spitting

Best believe that when you need that 
Ill provide that you will always have it 
I be on deck, keep it in check 
When you need that I'mma let you have it 

Beating my drum like dum di di dey 
I like the dirty rhythm you play 
I wanna hear you calling my name 
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama 
Banging the drum like dum di di dey 
I know you want it in the worst way 
I wanna hear you calling my name 
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama 

Be my woman girl I'll be your man
Be my woman girl I'll be your man

Whole crew got the juice
Your d*ck came the truth 
My screams is the proof 
Them other dudes get the deuce
When I speed in the coupe
Leavin' this interview
It ain't nothin' new 
I've been f*cking with you
None of the niggas taking you 
Just tell 'em to make a U
That's how it be
I come first like debut  

So baby when you need that
Give me a word I'm no good I be bad for my baby 

Make sure that hes getting his share 
Make sure that his baby take care 
Make sure I'm on my toes, on my knees, keep him pleased, rub him  down be a lady and a freak (Oh)

Beating my drum like dum di di dey 
I like the dirty rhythm you play 
I wanna hear you calling my name 
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama 
Banging the drum like dum di di dey 
I know you want it in the worst way 
I wanna hear you calling my name 
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama

Be my woman girl I'll be your man
Be my woman girl I'll be your man---Lyrics submitted by Gracie.
