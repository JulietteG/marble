People
In the middle
Life's a riddle
Not a game of dice
Not for a man who rolls with us

Days turn
Faster than a minute
How was I to know this?
Would you even notice me?
Cause they're imposters
We threw away the time

Anagram
I'm just a messenger man
It's the last time around
One of these days I wish you were
A hologram
If we're just passengers then
I wish it was the first time around
One of these days I wish you were
AH oooooh

All the people in
White stockings talk with pride
They'll be lifting up the flags high
Which will I decide?
Cause they're imposters
I'm making up

Anagram
I'm just a messenger man
It's the last time around
One of these days I wish you were
A hologram
If we're just passengers then
I wish it was the first time around
One of these days I wish you were
Ah oooooh

Collide
A stain in the light of your eyes
I'll see you another time
Come on baby roll the dice
I'm feeling like it's gonna break
This time will stars align?
I'm thinking that it's all the same

Anagram
I'm just a messenger man
It's the last time around
One of these days I wish you were
A hologram
If we're just passengeres then
I wish it was the first time around
One of these days I wish you were
Ah oooooh
