Darling, we have build a fire
out of need and strong desire
we must keep it burning
only ashes will remain 
oh yes it will

Remember kisses, feed the fire
and makes the flame of love grow high
so you can bet, I won't forget
to feed the flame

Feed the flame
keep it burning
give it love and watch it grow
with tenderness and loving care
there's no way for love to grow cold

So lets keep the love light burning bright
even when days seem dark as night
if it once flickers it may not ever be the same
oh no it won't 

Remember fate, feeds the fire
and trust make the flame go high 
so don't forget, please don't forget
to feed the flame 

Feed the flame 
keep it burning
give it love and watch it grow
with tenderness and loving care
there's no way for love to go cold---Lyrics submitted by Kyli.
