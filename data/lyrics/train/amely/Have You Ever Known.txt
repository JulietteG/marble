Have you ever known
What it's like to be nervous alone?
What it's like when the time slips right out of your hands?
Too late, now it's time to go

And you wish, you wish for a moment like this
Where the time would stand still
You kiss her with all that you have,
Just you let her know

'Cause sometimes it's hard to swallow,
But it's the way that I feel
Can make red lights a go
And there's nothing to stop me now

Maybe
I'll scream out loud
I'm fighting my way to the top
So that you just maybe
Might hear me now
I take a deep breath,
Let it out

Have you ever known
That I'm right there behind you?
So unbelievably taken by all that you are
Everything that I'll never know

And sometimes it's hard to swallow
But if you give me the chance
I'll never let go
'Cause there's nothing to stop me now

Maybe 
I'll scream out loud
I'm fighting my way to the top
So that you just maybe
Might hear me now
I take a deep breath
Let it out

As I scream at the top of my lungs
Make a scene just to catch your attention
And all in between 
Beauty and ones that we lost in the meaning

Maybe 
I'll scream out loud
I'm fighting my way to the top

Maybe 
I'll scream out loud
I'm fighting my way to the top
So that you just maybe
Might hear me now
I take a deep breath let it out
I take a deep breath let it out---Lyrics submitted by Melanie.
