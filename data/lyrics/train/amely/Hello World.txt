Hello world
Have you even missed me?
Looking down from outer space
Cause I've seen the stars, the sun and the sea
But now I'm back to this place

Show me a sign a reason for me 
All of the time that I've spent dreaming
Of somewhere that I'll feel alive
So show me a sign and guide me back home
Out of the sky into the unknown
Somewhere that I'll feel alive

Hello world
Is there something missing?
The life we had, it seems to be misplaced
I'd give it all to make you see me
But all your energy has been erased

Show me a sign a reason for me 
All of the time that I've spent dreaming
Of somewhere that I'll feel alive
So show me a sign and guide me back home
Out of the sky into the unknown
Somewhere that I'll feel alive

So show me the way to be in your eyes
Bigger than this life
Far away from this war hid inside

Hello world
Have you even missed me?
Looking down from outerspace

Show me a sign a reason for me 
All of the time that I've spent dreaming
Of somewhere that I'll feel alive
So show me a sign and guide me back home
Out of the sky into the unknown
Somewhere that I'll feel alive

Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
Hello world
Have you even missed me?---Lyrics submitted by Melanie.
