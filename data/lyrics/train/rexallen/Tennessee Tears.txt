My eyes are tired of crying Tennessee tears,
Tennessee tears from my heart,
My pillow's wet from crying Tennessee tears,
I think of you and teardrops start,
The world is cold without your love,
And though you've been unkind,
I can't escape from loving you,
You're always on my mind,
I know I've cried a million Tennessee tears,
Tennessee tears over you.

My eyes are tired of crying Tennessee tears,
Tennessee tears from my heart,
My pillow's wet from crying Tennessee tears,
I think of you and teardrops start,
The world is cold without your love,
And though you've been unkind,
I can't escape from loving you,
You're always on my mind,
I know I've cried a million,
A million or two,
Tennessee tears over you.---Lyrics submitted by Jud.
