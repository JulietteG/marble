Did you ever hear tell of sweet Betsy from Pike?
Who crossed the white prairies with her lover Ike
With two yoke of cattle and one spotted hog a tall Shanghai rooster and an old yeller dog

Toolly ri lum toolly ro lum toolly ri lum toodle lay

One evening quite early they camped on a plat
Made down their blankets on a green shady flat
Where Betsy quite tired lay down to repose
While with wonder Ike gazed on his Pike county rose

Toody rye lum toolly ro lum toolly ri lum toodle lay

Well the Indians came down in a wild yelling horde
And Betsy was scared they would scalp her adored
Behind the front wagon wheel Betsy did cry
And fought off the Indians with musket and ball

Toody rye lum toolly ro lum toolly ri lum toodle lay

Well they soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
And out in the sand she lay rolling about
While Ike in great terror looked down in surprise saying: "Betsy get up you'll get sand in your eyes!"

Toody rye lum toolly ro lum toolly ri lum toodle lay

Well Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died
The last piece of bacon that morning was fried
Poor Ike got discouraged and Betsy got mad
The dog wagged his tail and looked wonderfully sad

Toody rye lum toolly ro lum toolly ri lum toodle lay

Well Ike and sweet Betsy attended a dance
Where Ike wore a pair of his Pike county pants
Sweet Betsy who was covered with ribbons and rings
Said: "Ike you're an angel but where are your wings?"

Toody rye lum toolly ro lum toolly ri lum toodle lay---Lyrics submitted by crichton cuzner.
