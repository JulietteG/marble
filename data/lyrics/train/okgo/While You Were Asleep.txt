In the shallowest part of the night,
Where you quietly slept.
I lay here and I count in the hours,
To the sound of your breath.

Can't 'chu love me?
Can't 'chu love me how I want, please?
How I want.

I went walking down on second street,
Through the leaves and the clutter.
In the pale yellow sodium light
Nothing has any color.

Can't 'chu love me?
Can't 'chu love me how I want, please?
How I want.


Can't 'chu love me?
Can't 'chu love me how I want, please?
How I want.---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
