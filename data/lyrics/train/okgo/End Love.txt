Oh sugar,
Oh sugar can't you see
How hard I'm tryin'?

You know you've gotta,
You know you've gotta eventually
Make up your mind

'Cause no one's gonna find ya,
When you're hidin' in the dark,
No one's gonna find ya,
When you're hidin' in the dark,
No one's gonna find ya,
When you're hidin' in the dark,
No one's gonna find ya

So won't you,
So won't you talk to me?
It's time to decide

'Cause no one's gonna save ya
If you don't swim for the boat
No one's gonna save ya
If you won't take the rope
No one's gonna find ya
When you're hidin' in the dark,
No one's gonna find ya

And it's end love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is falling,
The sky is falling

So sugar,
So sugar dance with me,
Just one last time

We've got no reason,
We've got no reason I can see
To hold back tonight

'Cause no one's gonna catch ya
If you can't just let go,
No one's gonna love ya
If you can't let love show
No one's gonna find ya
When you're hidin' in the dark,
No one's gonna find ya

And it's end love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is falling,
The sky is falling

Oh sugar,
Oh sugar can't you see
How hard I'm tryin'?

You know you've gotta,
You know you've gotta eventually
Make up your mind
(You've gotta make up your mind)

And it's end love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is falling,
The sky is falling

End love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is, the sky is falling
End love, the sky is, the sky is falling---Lyrics submitted by Rylee.
