At first there was,
There was just no question.
Who wouldn't rather be their reflection?
When I got here everything was cold and perfect.
When I got here everything was cold and perfect.

It was clear and bright,
Like midwinter sunlight.
My heartbeat counting down a moment precise and quiet.
I look out and saw my own reflection helpless.
I look out and saw him overwhelmed and helpless.

But I...
What have I done what have I done?
Oooooo (Oh), what have I done?
Ooohhhh, what have I done?
My God, what have I done?
Oooo (OH), what have I done?
Ooh, what have I done?


As time went on
You could feel a silence.
Solidifying the sound of my thoughts is paralyzing.
I tried to call out to him but the glass was perfect.
It tried to call out to him but the glass was perfect.

But I...
What have I done what have I done?
Oooooo (Oh), what have I done?
Ooohhhh, what have I done?
My God, what have I done?
Oooo (OH), we can pay it
To get what 'chu want,
Ooh, to get what 'chu want.
Ooh, what have I done?

(Repeat 5x's)
Every day is the same,
We're praying for rain.
And when it finally came,
And when it came,
Everyday was the same,
Still praying for rain.---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
