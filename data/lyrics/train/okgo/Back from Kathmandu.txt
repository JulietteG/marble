In the dream you were,
Someone different.
You and everyone else all at once.
You were beautiful, you were beautiful.
In the dream you were,
Just like you are.

You loved everyone,
Like a sovereign.
Half magnanimous, half unimpressed.
And I was talkin' too much
I was tryin' too hard.
In the dream it was,
Just like it is.

Everything was so simple
Things are how they always will be.
You are the answer to the question that is me.
In the dream it was,
Just like it is.

We were captive in
In a prison.
Where everyone was guilty by mistake.
And it was infinite, it was infinite.
In the dream it was,
Just like it is.

And I, I asked 'is that good for you?'
You said "no, probably not,
but everybody's gotta get through the night
And love is all we got". Yeah!
In the dream it was
Just like it is.
Yeah in the dream it was,
just like it is.


In the dream you were
someone different.
You and everyone else all at once.
You were beautiful, you were beautiful.

In the dream it was,
Just like it is.---Lyrics submitted by Edward.
