Sit back, matter fact, teasing, toying, turning, 
Chatting, charming, hissing, paying the crowd. 
Play that song again, nother couple Klonopin 
Another glance, a half hearted bow. 

Oh such grace, oh such beauty. 
And lipstick and callous, and fishnets and mallice. 
Oh darling, youre a million ways to be cruel. 
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel). 
Youre a million ways to be cruel. 
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel). 
Youre a million ways to be cruel. 

I should, I wish I could, maybe if you were I would. 
A list of standard issue regrets. 
One last AD-proof, 
Slouching in the corner booth, 
Baby its as good as it gets. 

Oh such grace, oh such beauty. 
So precious, suspicious, and charming, and vicious. 
Oh darling, youre a million ways, 
Oh darling, youre a million ways to be cruel. 
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel). 
Youre a million ways to be cruel. 
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel). 
Youre a million ways to be cruel. 

Oh darlin, oh darlin, youre a million ways, 
Oh darlin, oh darlin, youre a million ways, 
Oh, darlin, oh darlin, youre a million ways to be, 
Ah ah ah ah ah, 
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel) 
Youre a million ways to be cruel. 
Youre a million ways to be cruel. 
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel) 

Oh darlin, youre a million ways to be cruel.---Lyrics submitted by Patricia.
