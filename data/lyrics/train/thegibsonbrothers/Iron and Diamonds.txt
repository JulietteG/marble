Verse 1
Upon Lyon Mountain, the houses look the same
Withered wood hid kids and wives and lives that never changed
It belonged to the devil, Aaron Hudson, every bit of iron rich ground
And the pile of sand big and blue grew out back of town
Six days went to the company, one to the man above
But the town lived for the afternoon, that was given to the ball and glove

Chorus
Around the horn of canned of corn, the ground hog will get you too
A life of iron and diamonds was all the miners knew

Verse 2
They were Pols and Lithuanians, Itals and Irish too
They dug into america, down a hole deep, dark and crew
Some had crossed a sea to get there
Some were born to die there too
Sons followed steps down to the mines behinds dads they never knew
They came alive between the foul lines with pride and dignity
In the bleachers and the batter's box, a miner could be free
