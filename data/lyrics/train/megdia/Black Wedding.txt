You, were unaware that diamonds came with debt
Ironic sure, but that's the way it is, got my vows off the internet
You, say crying weakens my immune system
But don't forget that if you pray for me I'll pray for you and cash flow too, why not? 
I said, if you pray for me i'll pray for you and cash flow too, why not? 

It was a black wedding, you could hear the organs not
The violins or the words the pope was saying
It was a black wedding, you could hear the organs but
No drunken snoring or real hallelujahs
Telling people stories of the devil
But most said they wouldn't last a winter
It was a black wedding
Your girl has blessings all around 

So, you're finally viewing this at 5 foot 6
it's not roses like your mama said
We're not spoon fed anymore
So you gonna tell 
All our kids I was an accident
Ironic true, but it's the way you act when you're upset 
So let's take this outside

We see our mirrors from outside, 
And he said we are what we cried
We stay hidden all our lives. 

It was a black wedding, you could hear the organs not
The violins or the words the pope was saying
It was a black wedding, you could hear the organs but
No drunken snoring or real hallelujahs
Telling people stories of the devil
But one of them said they wouldn't last a winter
It was a black wedding
Your girl has blessings all around

What else is there to know when our bible's here? 
What else is there to know when your bible's here?
There are no lies to find when the page is bare 
What else is there to know when your tax is shared? 


Outside, we're seeing mirrors from outside 
And he said we are what we cried 
We stay hidden all our lives

It was a black wedding
You could heard the organs not
Words the pope was saying 
It was a black wedding, you could hear the organs but 
No drunken snoring or real hallelujahs. 

The gravedigger said it's his cathedral 
We drank all we wanted like if it was supper
It was a black wedding
Your girl has blessings all around

What else is there to know when your bible's here? 
It was a black wedding
Your girl has blessings all around
What else is there to know when your tax is shared?
It was a black wedding
Your girl has blessings all around---Lyrics submitted by yvonne.
