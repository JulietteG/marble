This is sick
"Attention it's time to dance..."

Work it like you're working a pole
Shake it 'til you're shaking the floor
Pop it like you're poppin' a cork
Don't Stop, Don't Stop
Jerk it like you're making it choke
Break it like you're breakin' a code
Drop it till you're taking it lower

Drop it, drop it...

This is serious
I'm delirious
So oblivious
I could dance all night

With you
As long as its funky
This rhythm just makes me high
I'm like a junkie
I could dance all night

So intoxicated
I'm so stimulated
Feel so X-rated
I could dance all night

As long as it's funky
This rhythm just makes me high
I'm like a junkie
I could dance all night

Everybody on the floor (Let's go)
Let's get hardcore (Get low)
Make my sweat pour (Oh no)
Don't stop (Gimme some more)
Ooh my body's yours (spank that)
Spank that back door (like that)
Drive me like a Porsche' (yea)

I could dance all night

Can we take this party higher?

Now just put your hands to the sky and

Clap, clap, clap, clap

I could dance all night---
