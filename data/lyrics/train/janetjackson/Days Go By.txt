Laying here, wondering...when I'm gonna be wrapped up in your arms again.
Its almost like eternity, 'cause seconds feel like hours when you're gone from me. 
And maybe even though you were just by my side, I'm so missing you. (yeah...yeah)
And I know that I have you to myself when you come home.
(Chorus)
Yet it seems like...
days go by.
It feels like I'm...
So lost without you,
And I don't really know what to do.
The hands of time,
wont move when I'm...
away from you.
And I don't really know what to do.

I try to wait, patiently. But everything is taking way too long, and I... 
I just want to be with you, I'm trying to see it through. It's not fair...
Don't wanna be alone another day. Its just too miserable - It's true...
And baby I have learned, when you're far away - time stands still. Yet it seems like...

(Chorus x2)
Days go by.
It feels like I'm...
So lost without you,
And I don't really know what to do.
The hands of time,
wont move when I'm...
away from you.
And I don't really know what to do.

Ooooooh....Ahhhhhh.
Ooooooh....Ahhhhhh.

(Chorus x2)
Yet it seems like...
days go by.
It feels like I'm...
So lost without you,
And I don't really know what to do.
The hands of time,
wont move when I'm...
away from you.
And I don't really know what to do.---Lyrics submitted by Echo.
