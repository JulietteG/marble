We want to see Jesus lifted high
A Banner That Flies across this land
That all men might see
The Truth And Know
He is the way to heaven
We want to see Jesus lifted high
A Banner That Flies across this land
That all men might see
The Truth And Know
He is the way to heaven
We want to see, we want to see
We want to see, Jesus lifted high
We want to see, we want to see
We want to see, Jesus lifted high
We want to see Jesus lifted high
A Banner That Flies across this land
That all men might see
The Truth And Know
He is the way to heaven
We want to see, we want to see
We want to see, Jesus lifted high
We want to see, we want to see
We want to see, Jesus lifted high
Step By step were moving forward
Little by little taking ground
Every prayer a powerful weapon
Strongholds come tumbling down
And down and down and down
We want to see, we want to see
We want to see, Jesus lifted high
We gona to see, we gona to see
We gona to see, Jesus lifted high
We want to see Jesus lifted high
A Banner That Flies across this land
That all men might see
The Truth And Know
He is the way to heaven
We want to see Jesus lifted high
A Banner That Flies across this land
That all men might see
The Truth And Know
He is the way to heaven
