How lovely is 
Your dwelling place
Oh, Lord Almighty
For my soul longs and even faints
For You
For here my heart is satisfied
Within Your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of
Your wings

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

One thing I ask
And I would sing
To see Your beauty
To find you in the place
Your glory dwells

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

My heart and flesh cry out
To You the living God
Your spirit's water to my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will join near to You
I will join near to You
To You

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

Better is one day in Your courts
(Better is one day)
Better is one day in Your house
(Better is one day)
Better is one day in You courts
(Better is one day)
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
(Better is one day)
Better is one day in Your house
(Better is one day)
Better is one day in Your courts
(Better is one day)
Than thousands elsewhere
Thousands elsewhere.---Lyrics submitted by David Johnson.
