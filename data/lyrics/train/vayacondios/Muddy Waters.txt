Mama was angry
Said: "Girl you must have lost your head
Only the lazy
Stay the whole day long in bed
Your skirts need mending
And the floor cries to be swept
Don't make me scream, girl
Did you hear just what I said?"
She spoke up to me
Like so many times before
She said: "Now, listen, girl
You ain't walking through that door
Your friends may call you
You won't be hanging 'round no more
By the muddy waters"
OOh yeah, muddy waters
Mama was shouting
Said: "Girl, you better watch your step
That good-for-nothing
You couldn't trust him when he's dead
He makes no money
And though he dresses like a Lord
Sweet child believe me
He'll make your pretty eyes go sore"
She spoke up to me
Like a thousand times before
She said: "Now listen, girl
You ain't walking through that door
No little lady
You two are sailing way too close
By the muddy waters"
Ooh yeah, muddy waters
She spoke up to me
Like a thousand times before
She said: "Now listen, girl
You ain't walking through that door
No little lady
You two are sailing way to close
To the muddy waters"
Ooh yeah, the muddy waters.
I ain't gonna go
No more, no more, no more---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
