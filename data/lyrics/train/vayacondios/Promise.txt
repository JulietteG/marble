You say you love me
You say you love to love me

You say you love to love me baby
You think about me all the time
When you wake up in the morning 
And in your sweet dreams at night

You say you love to love me baby
You say Im always on your mind
That you would die if you would lose me
That Im the flavour in your life

You say you love to love me baby
And if theres sadness in your eyes
Its cos you want me for you only
And never want to say goodbye

Do you love me baby
Like you used to love me
Do you want me baby
Like you used to want me

But I dont know why
I cant believe what you say
After the Sunday you lied
About that phone call you made
No I dont why
Your heart went astray
When you made me your wife
After the promise we made

You say the girl meant nothing baby
It was a little game you played
To pass the time when you were lonely
While I was away

How could you purr to her now baby
The way you used to purr to me
How could you use the same words baby
Deceiving her deceiving me---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
