Raindrops falling softly
As I walk on down the road
Neon lights flicker
Reflecting on my leather coat
A black guy passes me by
He's looking kind'a high
When I'm reaching for a smile
I see that strange look in his eye
Here I am in Philadelphia
And I'm walking in the rain.
You're out there in Compton, baby
Do you still remember my name?
I couldn't hear what he said
But I suddenly realised
Thousands thoughts go through my head
While his steps they follow mine
A woman must be crazy
To be out this time at night
Unless she's looking for some business
Unless she's feeling real uptight
Here I am in Philadelphia
And I'm walking in the rain. (x 2)
You're out there in Compton, baby
Do you still remember my name?
Here I'm standing at the station
Waiting for my train to come
When that dude gave me a look
Made me wonder what I'd done
A woman must be crazy
To be out this time at night
Unless she's looking for some trouble
Unless she's out of her mind
Here I am in Philadelphia
And I'm walking in the rain. (x 2)
You're out there in Compton, baby
Do you still remember my name?
Do you baby?
Do you remember?
Do you baby?
Do you remember?
Remember my name?---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
