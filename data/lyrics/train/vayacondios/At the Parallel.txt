He stands by the doors of the Rex all night
Chain-smoking Celtas
His eyes trouble more than one woman
His voice is heavy and deep
Theres dirt on the sidewalk
And the newsboys yell
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel

Theres a girl at the Molino, she wears a leather coat
The dust of Barcelona sticks to her heels as she walks through the door And he thinks: what the hell has she come in for?
Maybe she wants me, and thats her way to say it.
Maybe she wants me, and thats her way to say it.
Maybe she wants me, but who am I to tell?

He bites his fingernails
Scratches his eyebrows
Lights another cigarette
Watching the queens of the street
Acting their parody of love
And he feels like he stands by the gates of hell
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel

That girl from the Molino who wears the leather coat
Sits there rocking slowly on a chair gazing dreamily at the door
And he thinks: what the hell has she looked in for?
Maybe she wants me, and thats her way to say it.
Maybe she wants me, and thats her way to say it. 
Maybe she wants me, but who am I to tell?---Lyrics submitted by Raul.
