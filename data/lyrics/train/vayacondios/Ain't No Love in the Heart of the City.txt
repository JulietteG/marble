Aint no love in the heart of the city
Aint no love in the heart of town
Aint no love and it sure enough is a pity
Aint no love cause you aint around

When you were mine
I was feeling so good
Cause your love lit up
This old neighbourhood
But now that youre gone
You know the sun dont shine
From the city hall to the county line

Aint no love in the heart of the city
Aint no love in the heart of town
Aint no love and it sure enough is a pity
Aint no love cause you aint around

Every place that I go
It seems so strange 
Without you there 
Things have changed
When your night-time calls
Theres a blanket of gloom
Another teardrop falls in my lonely room---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
