Angel, for you
There's nothing she wouldn't do
She'd give you the moon
Wrapped in the morning drew
Her love is so strong
You could never do no wrong
When the damage is done
You know she'll excuse you
Afraid to lose you
Chorus
You've always been her little boy
Her joy and her pride
She watched you smashing up for your toys
Now you smash up your life
But rememer, baby
It was all for you, baby
Baby, for you
There's nothing she wouldn't do
She'd give you the moon
When you don't want her to
Chorus
Only for you---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
