Chains,that she wears like a crown
For to slavery bound
From the day they have met
Chains that she's dragging around
Never making a sound
From the day she said 'yes'
Chains, to keep her tied to the ground
While he is slipping away
Queen in a glorified cage
With only silence to page
The lonely night long
Wait for the footsteps to fall
For his voice in the hall
Calling her name again
Pray for all the sweetness long gone
When all that's left is the pain
Shame that she's keeping inside
Hiding misery behind
Fancy curtains of lace
Vain, she's hoping in vain
He would kindle the flame
That once burned in his eyes
Rain that beats like time on the pane
When every second's the same
Rain that beats like time on the pane
When every secon's the same
Woman, don't bury that heart of gold
Behind a cold face of stone---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
