No dimes in your pocket
No bills in your wallet
No cash in the bank
Ain't no good at all
Honey you're not wise
You don't realise
People talk you know
Guess what I've been told
When you come home late
That beat look on your face
Don't tell me it's because
You're working night and day
I'm not blind
I got eyes you see
You're a mean moonshiner
You've been seen down at Joe's
Spending all of my dough
Splashing bourbon and rye
Playing randy and dandy, the game stakes are high
Honey you're a lie
Just a no good guy
Phoney Romeo
In a late late show
When I took you home
To mama she said
This guy looks like
He's got a hole in his head
Lord protect us from evil she cried
He's a mean moonshiner
Honey don't you grieve
When I take my leave
I ain't gonna cry
For my last goodbye
I'm gonna take that door
Don't care what you say
You never did say much anyway
I care no longer
For the company
Of a mean moonshiner---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
