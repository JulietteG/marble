It was so long ago
Baby so long ago
Your rovin' eyes had set me on fire
So long ago
Maybe too long ago
Your crooked smile was driving me wild
The things we had together, baby
They belong to the past
The things we had together
We knew they never could last
And it all now belongs to the past
Yeah, yeah
The things we had together, baby
They belong to the past
The things we had together
Oh they faded so fast
And now that all's been said and done, baby
Now guess what I'm gonna do?
Now that it's all over, baby
I'm gonna find myself ...
Somebody new, yeah
The things we had together, baby
They belong to the past
The things we had together
Oh, they faded so fast
But now that all is said and done, baby
Guess what I'm gonna do?
Yeah, now that it's all over, baby
I'm gonna find myself ...
Somebody new, yeah
It was so long ago
Your roving eyes had set me on fire
Too long ago
Maybe too long ago
Your wicked ways had driven me wild
It was so long ago
Baby, so long ago
Your crooked smile had driven me wild
So long ago
Yeah, so long ago
Your roving eyes had set me on fire---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
