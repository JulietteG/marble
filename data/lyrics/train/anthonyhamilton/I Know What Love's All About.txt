It's about finding a new experience
with someone you never thoght you'd meet
who totally turns your life around completely
helping you get a job and keeping you off the streets.

Church on sunday morning 
eventually I'm saving money
sending my life in a new direction
Now I'm friends with my ole man again
standing here wearing this wedding band
I can say I know love because of you
See I know love I

I know what love's is all about

(and you showed me love)
I know what love's all about

I used think that love was just a weekend thing
the way you make feel
(sharing a moment of emptiness)
But you see that wasn't nothing 
cause the moment she left I forgot about her
until you came in and you showed me what it really
felt to be loved, and kissed, and held, and prayed for
and wanted and nurtured and guided and ohhh to be understood.

I know what love's all about
I know was about
you showed me loved now I know I know I know
I know what love's about
I know I love caused you showed me baby
see you don't have to worry about a thing now
cause I know real love
I know I I can it here I can talk about it cause 
I've experiened it and feeling it I'm living it
right here right now, I got somebody who will love me
for me. I got somebody who will love me for me.

I know I sometimes I had to realize that it was about
compromise,and that you can't always have your way you can't always can't
always have it your way cause love is about realizing 
and love is about is about redirectiing
your decisions rather to go out all night long or go home
to the ones you love it about taking care of your family and taking care of
your kids and freaking your wife at night and letting her know that bills will
be paid on time and that you sit back and you lick and you listen to her cause it about 
love love love love....love---Lyrics submitted by Lovely.
