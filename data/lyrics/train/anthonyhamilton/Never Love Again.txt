How could i ever hide what I felt
How could you ever say you never knew
all along it was there on my mind in my heart, it was the feeling, i was in love.
you act as if you never knew my name, how could you treasure puttin me through so much pain, like a
child in the womb i needed you to give me love I miss that feeling of being loved

[Chorus]
How could I ever love again
how could I start to love again
After you broke me down, its hard to trust that feeling, to fall in love again

[Verse 2]
A man dont usually fall no more then twice and if he does you'll never know cause he wont say,
for the fear of being fooled taken twice by the heart, it's in his nature, to be afraid, he starts to
wonder if its really right, to let his past take control of his life, maybe I'll run into hope, someone
thats right for me, and she'll love freely and fall in love again

[Chorus]

Love 
You know what they say about a man its hard for him to fall in love
Love
Once hurt he'll never give in its hard for him to trust
Love
Bowing down it was hard to cope, when ya love broke down on me it was hard for me to trust again
