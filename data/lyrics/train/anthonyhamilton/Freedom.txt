Felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders
..should I break or retreat and then return
Facing the fear that the truth, I discover
No telling how, all these will work out
But Ive come to far to go back now.

Chorus:
I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it cost me everything I have
Well I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have

I know all too well it dont come easy
the chains of the world they seem to movin tight
I try to walk around if Im stumbling so come..
tryin to get up but the doubt is so strong
theres gotta be a winning in my bones

Chorus:
Im looking for freedom, looking for freedom
and to find it, cost me everything I have
Well Im looking for freedom, Im looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have

Oh not giving up theres always been hard, so hard
but if I do the thanks lase the way I wont get far.

Mhm, life hasnt been very kind to me lately, (well)
but I suppose its a push from moving on (oh yeah)
in time the suns gonna shine on me nicely (on me yeah )
sudden tells me cause things are coming
and I aint gonna not believe

Chorus:
Im looking for freedom, looking for freedom
and to find it, cost me everything I have
Well Im looking for freedom, Im looking for freedom
And to find it, may take everything I have---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
