I pulled that straight back wicker chair,
up next to grandpa's bed.
With a voice left weak by pain,
my grandpa softly said,

"Could you get my cowboy boots,
that gold pocketwatch of mine,
and bring me my sunday suit,
with the vest of satin white."

When he saw the sadness growin' in my eyes,
he said, "I've got to be prepared,
cuz' I'm goin' home tonight."

And I'm gonna waltz across the heavens,
while a band of angels play.
I'm gonna twostep on some stardust a million miles away.
I'll never have a new beginning until I've reach the end.
and these ol' legs are gonna come to life again.
Gonna wake up dancin.

He said,"If it ain't too much trouble,
theres one thing left to do,
since I'm goin to see your grandma,
could you fetch her favorite shoes?

The ones with those ribbons...
red, and checkered, and white.
The last time that she had them on,
I believed we danced all night.
And why she left them here is plain to see,
your grandma never danced with anyone but me."

And we're goin to waltz across the heavens,
while a band of angels play.
We're gonna twostep on some stardust a million miles away.
We'll never have a new beginning until we've reached the end.
And these ol legs are gonna come to life again.
Gonna wake up dancin.

We're goin' to waltz across the heavens,
while a band of angels play.
We're gonna twostep on some stardust a million miles away.
We'll never have a new beginning until we've reached the end,
and these ol' legs are gonna come to life again.
Gonna wake up dancin.

Gonna wake up dancin.
