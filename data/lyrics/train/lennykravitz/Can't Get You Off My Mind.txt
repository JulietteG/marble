"Life is just a lonely highway
Im out here on the open road
Im old enough to see behind me
But young enough to feel my soul

I dont wanna lose you baby
And I dont wanna be alone
Dont wanna live my days without you
But for now Ive got to be without you

Ive got a pocket full of money
And a pocket full of a keys that have no bounds
But then I think of lovin
And I just cant get you off of my mind, yeah

Babe, cant you see that this is killing me?
I dont wanna push you baby
And I dont want you to be told
Its just that I cant breath without you
Feel like Im gonna lose control

Ive got a pocket full of money
(Oh, yes I do)
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
But when it comes to lovin
I just cant get you off of my mind, yeah

Am I a fool to think that theres a little hope?!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me baby, yeah
What are the rules, the reasons and the "dos" and "donts"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me baby, tell me baby yeah
What do you feel inside?

Ive got a pocket full a money
And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds, oh yeah
But when it comes down to lovin
I just cant get you off of my mind, yeah
I just cant get you off of my mind, yeah"---Lyrics submitted by Rusty.
