The serpent knows, 
When the curtain falls, 
With denials blindfold, 
He greets another day

Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie, 
A perfect ten, 
When reality caves in
Don't tell me, 
Tell my ghost, 
Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
I found secrets about life's undertow

Life's wrapped in a riddle, 
Easier said than done, 
Way to play the victim, 
Just run and hide.

Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie, 
A perfect ten, 
When reality caves in
Don't tell me, 
Tell my ghost, 
Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
I found secrets about life's undertow

Let them take me far away

Crawl back in place, 
It's easier to cope behind the curtain, 
Wipe the worries away
No thought about the consequence

Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie, 
A perfect ten, 
When reality caves in
Don't tell me, 
Tell my ghost, 
Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
I found secrets about life's undertow

Let them take me far away---Lyrics submitted by Cloud.
