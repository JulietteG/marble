Look at the dead outside my window
wonder what's on their mind
why do they run,they all seem to have a mission
but do they cry themselve's to sleep?

You ever seen what you did?
then this is like nothing
I feel like sh*t
but at least I feel something

Is this all your meant to be?

There are marks in the pavement
you walked this route too many times
what if I changed the signs,
would you even take notice?

You ever see what you did?
then this is like nothing
I feel like sh*t 
but at least I feel something

Is this all you have to give?
(so...march)straight jacket union
(so...march)in chains surrender

You ever see what you did?
then this is like nothing
I feel like sh*t 
but at least I feel something

You ever see what you did 
then this is like nothing
I feel like sh*t 
but at least I feel something.---Lyrics submitted by tacocat.
