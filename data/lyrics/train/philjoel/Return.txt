It feels like we just started
It all begins today
To be a victor
Not a victim unguarded
Nothing round here
Looks quite the same
Though the scars remain

Chorus:
You have been so good to me
And I will return
You have been so good to me
And everyday
I will return

You know we are the targets
The lions are outside
You and me they want
They must be denied
Still falling those fingers
Are the grains of sand
You call it my pride
Will we flee tonight
Or will I fight by Your side?

I will seek You all of my days
Everyday Ill return again
I will rise to seek Your face
Everyday I will return again---Lyrics submitted by Phil Smethurst.
