How can you forgive me when I've often gone astray?
How can you think of me when I do things my way?
Turning my back on you,
The one who loved me first,
Having my own desires, 
Renewing worldly thirst.

You told me, you loved me,
And that should make up my mind.
You tell me, come back now,
But I keep wasting time.
Feeling so very weak,
You say I can be strong.
I feel I've gone to far,
You tell me to come home.

You love me still,
And I know this is real.

[Chorus]
And I am running back to you,
I see you standing there for me.
Your arms are open wide,
And I don't have to cry no more.
You're standing there for me,
And I am running back to you.
Why do I go away, W
hen I know I am no good.
When I'm on my own.

You told me you could keep me,
But I've turned it away.
I failed you so much now,
I dont know what to say.
Using the same excuse,
That I am just a man.
You tell me you've been there,
And hold your nail scarred hands.

So I can see,
Now I know I am free.

[Chorus]

I have taken advantage of your love and grace,
Forgive me Lord.
And take me home. 
Take me home.

I'm running to you Jesus,
Please take me home.
See I've been in this wrong way to long,
And I can't do right any more.
I'm tired of pain and I don't like fear,
But, Lord I want to be more sincere.
I never should have left your side.
Returning to your guiding light.

[Chorus]x2---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
