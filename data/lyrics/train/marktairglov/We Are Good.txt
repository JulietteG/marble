Early morning, rising with the sun,
resting where the sky meets the earth.
'feeling the first rays of sunlight reach into my soul
where they reinstate the sense of my own self-worth.

If you're not good, you're bad: that's far too black and white.
Behold the glorious sun in all its radiance bright.
It too is at times is obscured by the thick blue veil of night.
Still the moon and all the stars combine to reflect its light.

And so it is that we are good though we do not always do as we should.
We lose track of right and wrong and we're not always standing strong.
But still, don't you wanna believe in things that eyes do not perceive
like the light shining from within that in a battle with our darkness can win?

The gates of heaven open up before me as my heart is given wings and flies.
Leaving all pretense behind, everything is crystal clear.
Even the worry of uncertainty subsides.

They say the time will come for us to be reborn
into newness of unity that has been torn into duality,
into "It's us against them."
It's from that place of fear that all our conflicts stem.

Almost there but not yet still the stage is set
for the play we may enact according to our contract.
That we made both you and I with everybody in our home up high
to awaken from our deep and long undisturbed though hardly peaceful sleep.

If to look is to know the grace that you would bestow
Upon those that you would raise into a kind and loving gaze
Then to look is to see everyone as good as they can be.---Lyrics submitted by Jesus Fabela.
