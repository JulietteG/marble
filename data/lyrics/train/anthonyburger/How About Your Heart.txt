Vs 1
How about your heart
Is it right with God
That's the thing that counts today
Is it black by sin
Is it pure within
Could you ask Christ in to stay

Chorus
People often see you
As you are outside
Jesus really knows you
For He sees inside
How about your heart
Is it right with God
That's the thing that counts today

Vs 2
Friend how would you feel
If your heart were made
With a window on each side
So that all could see
Not just outward charm
But detect if inward harm---Lyrics submitted by Sally Earnest.
