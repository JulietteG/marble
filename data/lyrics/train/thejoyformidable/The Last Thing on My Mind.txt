Just had to follow those walking-eyes
And if I'm left with the sweetest line,
Take it up with me some day
Leave it at the door I'm playing

I wouldn't say that this is the end
Too lightly
But sometimes you don't have to choose
Run away and watch me go

When the night just gets away
When your chance gets deliver late
Even when I'm out of time
You're the last thing on my mind

When I let all the voices in
And my punctured heart's feeling everything
Even when I think I'm trying
You're the last thing on my mind

I don't know what got into me
Hot and cold water meeting
I'm telling you, there's no place I've been
Where my mind stops wandering, wandering.

I wouldn't say, I'm tying the ends
Too tightly
But I'm clearing out old news
(Run away and watch me go)

When the night just gets away
When your chance gets delivered late
Even when I'm out of time
You're the last thing on my mind

When I let all the voices in
And my punctured heart's feeling everything
Even when I think I'm trying
You're the last thing on my mind

The last thing, the last thing
The last thing, the last thing
The last thing, the last thing on my mind

The last thing, the last thing
The last thing, the last thing
The last thing, the last thing on my mind.---
