i'm true
said I'm crazy over you
no one else will do
oh darling you don't love me

say, i had it all planned just for you
well you broke my plans in two
you know you just don't love me

everybody knows
i'm crazy over you
and no one else but you
knows how, said how, 
how...you know 

i guess that's all there is to tell
you said your life is well
you know you just don't love me

everybody knows
i'm crazy over you

and no, no one, no one
no one else but you can tell anyone
just how much
how much...how how how how
how i love you love you love you love you

i guess that's all there is to tell
you said your life is well
you know you just don't love me

i've given you my heart
darling you don't love me---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Davids.
