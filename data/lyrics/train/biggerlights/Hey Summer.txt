Well, I dont mean to push
The streets are rolled in dust
But youre waiting there for me
Whats inside of us
That reaches out to touch
And always come up empty?
The doorway casts shadows on your skin
You crack your knuckles and you roll to win
You tie your laces tight and you begin to run and run and run

Hey summer
You wont be the one to give in
Hey summer,
Fighting as your city's sinking
Hey lover
You dont have to sleep alone
No you dont

So mysterious
An isolationist
But youre calling out to me
Ill stand against your tide
Ill let you seek and hide
Ill wait so patiently
Draw a map of where you want to go
Ill be the X on a desert road
The days are hot and the nights are cold
Just run and run and run

Hey summer
you won't be the one to give in
Hey summer
fighting as your city's sinking
Hey lover
You dont have to sleep alone
No you dont

Give me a sign
Give me the chance
To belong to you

Give me a sign
Give me the chance
To belong to you

Hey summer
You wont be the one to give in
Hey summer
Fighting as your citys sinking
Hey lover
You dont have to sleep alone
No you dont

Hey summer
You wont be the one to give in
Hey summer
Fighting as your citys sinking
Hey lover
You dont have to sleep alone
No you dont---Lyrics submitted by alissa.
