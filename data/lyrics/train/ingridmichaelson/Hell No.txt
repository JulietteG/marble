I should've known better
I saw her wearing your sweater
Nice glasses, fake red hair, just like me
Stop crying, stop crawling
Can't you see that I have stop falling
We were good at faking forever
I get it, whatever
Am I gonna miss you?

Hell no
Baby watch me up and go
Problem is that the boys like you never work any way
(Boys like you)
Girlsfriends say "are you gonna be sad
If you calls you up you're gonna take him right back?"
Hello no, oh, hell no
I get it, whatever

Straight up, don't blame you
You're not the cash and I'm not the jewel
Never be the one to make you better
Whatever

Hell no
Baby watch me up and go
Problem is that the boys like you never work any way
(Boys like you)
Girlsfriends say "are you gonna be sad
If you calls you up you're gonna take him right back?"
Hello no, oh, hell no

In my bed late at night
Thinking of how you held me tight
Will I be lonely when I wake?
Did we make a big mistake?

Hell no
Baby watch me up and go
I always knew that a boy like you wouldn't work out any way
"You gonna take him right back?"
Hello no
Problem is that the boys like you never work any way
(Boys like you)
Girlfriends say "are you gonna be sad
If you calls you up you're gonna take him right back?"
Hello no, oh, hell no

I get it
Hell no
(I'm not gonna miss you)
Whatever
Hell no
You gonna take him back?
Oh hell no---
