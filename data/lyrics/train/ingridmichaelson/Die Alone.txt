ba da dum, ba da dum, ba da dum. . . .da dum
ba da dum, ba da dum, ba da dum. . . .da dum

i woke up this morning,
a funny taste in my head,
i spackeld some butter,
over my whole grain bread,
somethin tastes different,
mabey its my tounge,
somethin tastes different.
suddenly im not so young.

ba da dum, ba da dum, ba da dum. . . .da dum
ba da dum, ba da dum, ba da dum. . . .da dum

im just a stranger,
even to myself, 
a rearanger of,
the preverbeal book shelf.
dont be a fool girl,
how can you love him,
dont be a fool girl,
your not above him,

I never thought i could love any one but my self,
now i know i cant love any one but you,
but you . .   make me think that mabey i wont die alone,
mabey i wont die alone.

ba da dum, ba da dum, ba da dum. . . .da dum
ba da dum, ba da dum, ba da dum. . . .da dum

kiss the boys as they walk by,
call me their baby,
but little do they know,
im just a mabey,
mabey my baby will be the one to leave me soar,
mabey my baby will settle the score.

I never thought i could love any one but my self,
now i know i cant love any one but you. . . . .,
but you . .   make me think that mabey i wont die alone,
mabey i wont die alone. 


what have i become,
something soft. .and really quite down,
cuz ive fallen, cuz ive fall fallen cuz ive fall fall fallen,
so far away from the place where i started from. . .

i never thought i could love anyone,
i never thought i could love anyone,
i never thought i could love anyone,
i never thought i could love anyone,
i never thought i could love anyone,
but you. . .
make me think i wont die alone ,
mabey i wont die alone.---Lyrics submitted by meghan.
