I think I'm the only one who really knows
What the emptiness inside of you will show us
We are only tiny babies living right here
Gone the way of someone else's bygone year

Can you feel me crying out to you are somewhere?
Can I see you?

When the lights do go out where do we all go?
When the fallout comes we know the show must go
Please just give to me your pair of handsome hands
Then I really won't care where my body lands

Can you feel me crying out to you are somewhere?
Can I see you?

Can you feel me crying out to you are somewhere?
Can I see you?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
