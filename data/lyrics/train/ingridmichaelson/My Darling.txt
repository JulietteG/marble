My darling, you made me strong
And make me all the things I want to be long gone
My only, my only one
And now it's over, I only got him barely holding on
Holding on, holding on
Just keep holding on

Every time, that I think that I'm moving
Turns around, I'm just spinning in blink
By the time that I know why I left her
I want someone to take it away
And I know that I've been broken, since the first time
Got me fire don't know the floor
With the fresh eyes, it's been such a long time

My darling, you made me strong
And make me all the things I want to be long gone
My only, my only one
And now it's over, I only got him barely holding on
Holding on, holding on
Just keep holding on---
