Have you ever thought about what protects our hearts, 
just a cage of rib bones and other various parts
So, it's fairly simple to cut right through the mess 
and to stop the muscle that makes us confess

We are so fragile 
and our cracking bones make noise
and we are just 
breakable breakable breakable girls and boys 

You fasten my seatbelt because it is the law
In your two ton death trap I finally saw
A piece of love in your face that bathed me in regret
Then you drove me to places I'll never forget

We are so fragile
and our cracking bones make noise 
and we are just
breakable breakable breakable girls and boys 

and we are so fragile
and our cracking bones make noise
and we are just
breakable breakable breakable girls 
breakable breakable breakable girls 
breakable breakable breakable girls and boys---Lyrics submitted by Courtney.
