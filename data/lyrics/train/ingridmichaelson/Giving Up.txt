What if we stopped having a ball?
What if the paint chips from the wall?
What if there's always cups in the sink?
What if I'm not what you think?
I am...?

What if I fall further than you?
What if you dream of somebody new?
What if I never let you win?
Chase you with a rolling pin?
Well, what if I do?

'Cause I-I am gi-iving up
On making passes
And I-I am gi-iving up
On half-empty glasses
And I-I am gi-iving up
On greener grasses
I-I am giving up

What if our baby comes in after nine?
What if your eyes close before mine?
What if you lose yourself sometimes?
Then I'll be the one to find you
Safe in my heart

'Cause I-I am gi-iving up
On making passes
And I-I am gi-iving up
On half-empty glasses
And I-I am gi-iving up
On greener grasses
I-I am giving up
'Cause I-I am gi-iving up (I-I...am gi-iving... up)
And I-I... am gi-iving... up (I-I...am gi-iving... up)
And I...
Am gi...
...ving up
on greener grasses
I-I am giving up
For you
Oh, oh I-I am giving up
For you
Oh, oh I-I am giving up---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
