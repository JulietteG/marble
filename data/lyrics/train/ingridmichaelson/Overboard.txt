Fall over
Fall overboard, overboard
Fall overboard
Just so you can catch me

Fall over
Fall over
Fall overboard, overboard

To fall
To fall
To fall

To fall over, fall over, fall over....

Fall over
Fall over
Fall overboard, overboard
Fall overboard
Just so you can catch me
You can catch me
You, you can catch me---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
