Yesterday,
I woke up,
With your head,
On my arm.
My hand was numb; circulation gone,
But I dared not move the pretty sleeping one.

The sun had painted patterns on your face,
As you breathed Sunday air.
You rolled onto my open arm.
I became your pillow; you let me smooth your hair.

chorus:
I will sing you morning lullabies.
You are beautiful,
And peaceful this way.
I know you have to close your eyes on everyone;
let me help you.
(I'll sing you to sleep with morning lullabies.)

Let me lie,
In the curve,
Of your body tonight;
And I will hear you tumble into sleep.
I will want you here; I'll want you here with me.

(chorus)

I know you have to close your eyes on everyone! 
Let me help you; I'll sing you to sleep,
With morning lullaby bye baby,
Close your eyes and I will sing you morning lullabies. 
(And I will sing you morning lullabies.)---Lyrics submitted by Sahara.
