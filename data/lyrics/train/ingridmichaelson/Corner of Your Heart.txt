There's a corner of your heart
for me
There's a corner of your heart
just for me
I will pack my bags
just to stay in the corner of your heart
just to stay in the corner of your heart

There is room beneath your bed
for me
There is room beneath your bed
just for me
I will leave this town
just to sleep underneath your bed
just to sleep underneath your bed

There's one minute of your day
There's one minute of your day
There's one minute of your day
I will leave this man
just to occupy one minute of your day
just to occupy one minute of your day
just to sleep underneath your bed
just to stay in the corner of your heart---Lyrics submitted by Lauren.
