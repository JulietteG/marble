I don't care if it's too late for this
I missed you
I need an angel
I don't care
Tell him
I am a shadow
I drink too much

I need to find silence, time
Let's get a while
I find it hard to breath the truth
All things I think I breathe
Sip and took my lungs
But I don't want a broken heart

I admit I'm living just inside my home
But I don't want to live here no more
Now I'm down to my own feet
I go with you
Cause I fall at my own feet
I could run down the high street
But that would be
Now I breathe lonely

I don't care we search for answers
Cause we'll never
I fell effortless
I miss some good time
Now I dance to my own beat
I go with you
Cause I fall at my own feet
I could run down the high street
But that would be a lie
Now I preach to the lonely

Now I dance to my own beat
I go with you
Cause I fall at my own feet
I could run down the high street
But that would be a lie
Now I preach to the lonely---
