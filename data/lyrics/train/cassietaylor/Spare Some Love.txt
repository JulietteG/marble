been feeling mighty down 
sun setting on the day 
my mind grows weary 
feel the burning weight 
i once was happy 
i felt no pain 
i had a roof 
to shelter me from the rain 

well my coat is torn 
seems come undone 
my cup is empty 
can you spare some love 

i'm down and out 
not a penny in change 
i should leave this place 
ain't no use in staying 
my soul is weary 
and my heart worn 
ain't slept in days 
no house and no home 

well my coat is torn 
seems come undone 
my cup is empty 
can you spare some love 

so sit down beside me 
spare a second of your time 
i don't need a penny 
i don't need a dime 
and i'll tell you my story 
not a word of a lie 
it's a tale of sadness 
and a wasted life 

well my coat is torn 
seems come undone 
my cup is empty 
can you spare some love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
