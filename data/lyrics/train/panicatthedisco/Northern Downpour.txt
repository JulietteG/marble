If all our life is but a dream
fantastic posing greed
then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
for diamonds do appear to be just like broken glass to me
and then she said she can't believe that genuis only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
tripping eyes and flooded lungs
nothern downpour sends its love

hey moon, please forget to go down
hey moon, don't you go down

sugar cane in the easy morning
weather vane my one a lonely

the ink is running towards the page
it's chasing off the days 
look back at both feet and that winding meet
I missed your skin when you were East
you clicked your heels and wished for me

through playful lips made of yarn
that fragile Capricorn unraveled words like moths up on old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
but melt your head aches 
call it home

hey moon, please forget to go down
hey moon, don't you go down

sugar cane in the easy morning
weather vane my one and lonely 

hey moon, please forget to do down
hey moon, don't you go down

you are at the top of my lungs
drawn to the ones who never yawn---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
