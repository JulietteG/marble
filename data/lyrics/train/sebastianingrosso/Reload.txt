(feat. Tommy Trash & John Martin)

When night becomes the day 
Theyre sending you far away 
So so far away. 

When everything starts to fade 
You dont have to be afraid 
No you dont have to be afraid 

Take my hand and reload 
This is free love 
Thats what we are made of 
Yes we are, are, are. 
Reload, this is reload 
Thats what we are made of 
Yes we are, are, are. 

Are are are are are 
Yes we are are are. 

When you want to get off the ground 
But gravity pulls you down 
Gravity pulls you down. 
And when you feel out of place 
You dont have to be afraid 
No you dont have to be afraid 

Take my hand and reload 
This is free love 
Thats what we are made of 
Yes we are, are, are. 
Reload, this is reload 
Thats what we are made of 
Yes we are, are, are. 

Yes we are, are, are.. 
Thats what we are made of 
Yes we are, are, are.---
