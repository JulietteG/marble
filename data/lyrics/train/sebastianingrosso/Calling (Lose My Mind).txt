Can we freeze, come and surrender our rights and wrongs?
Can we just for one night let
The stars decide where we belong?
Maybe heaven right now
Is a devil or angel away
That won't change
Together we vow that our colors will sparkle the faith
And I will find you
I will find you
I will reach you
Or I, I, I will lose my mind
Lose my mind
Lose my mind
Lose my mind, yeah

I will lose my mind, yeah
Lose my mind, yeah

Maybe heaven right now
Is a devil or angel away
That won't change
Together we vow that our colors will sparkle the faith
And I will find you,
I will find you,
I will reach you
Or I, I, I will lose my mind
I will lose my mind, yeah
Lose my mind, yeah.---
