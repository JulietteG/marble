Tonight, we're the sea and the salty breeze
the milk from your breast is on my lips
and lovelier words from your mouth to me
when salty my sweat and fingertips

Our hands they seek the end of afternoon
My hands believe and move over you

Tonight, we're the sea and 
the rhythm there 
the waves and the wind and night is black 
tonight we're the scent of your 
long black hair 
spread out like your breath 
across my back 
Your hands they move like waves over me 
beneath the moon, tonight, we're the sea---Lyrics submitted by Allison.
