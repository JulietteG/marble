She said I love you boy I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oooohh ooohhh
She said I love you more than words could say
She said I love you bay-ay-ay-ay-ay-bay

So I said what your saying girl it cant be right 
How you can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
But she said but boy I loved you from the start
When I first heard love goes down something started burning in my heart
I said stop this crazy talk leave right now and close the door (she said)

But I love you boy I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oooohh oooh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bay-ay-ay-ayyy-bay (Oh yes she did)

So now Im up in the courts pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and the jury the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested, Im innocent i protested
 She just feels rejected, had her heart broke by someone she obsessed with
Cos she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
Thats why love goes down makes her loose it
Cos she cant separate the man from the music
And Im saying all this in the stand
While my girl cries tears in the gallery
This has got bigger then I ever could have planned 
Like that song by the Zutons, Valerie
But the jury dont look like theyre buying it
And this is making me nervous
Arms crossed, screw faced like Im trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murderers
They wanna lock me up and throw away the key
They wanna send me down even though I told em she

She said I love you boy I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh
(yes she did)
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bay-ay-ay-ay-ayyy-bay
So I said then why the hell you gotta treat me this way?
You dont know what love is you wouldnt do this if you did---
