verse 1:
So he says he loves you, wants you to be his wife
But he's too hooked on the crack pipe for that to be right
It's all lies, none of it's true, though it hurts
You know what you gotta do, cut him loose like a dirty needle
You don't know where he's been
All I know is that I've seen him high when he says that he's clean
There was a gray patch when he first bust on the scene
But as the mystery unraveled, all became black and white
Know what I mean?
We can never be friends, he can go to hell
No more hanging 'round the house like a bad smell
Either he goes or I do, it's your decision, mama, it's all on you
You're too old to be naive and I know you ain't ignorant
That's what's botherin' me, ma 'cos you're goin' on different
And I ain't never seen you loved up like this before
Why's it everybody but you who can see that you deserve more?

chorus:
Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that

verse 2:
When I first met him, thought he was cool
Had a few things in common like supporting Arsenal
I saw the way he made you happy like a love fool
Coming down when times were hard up stressful
But all that don't matter to shit
When he starts acting like a little kid
Treating you as if you was some kind of bitch
Mama, you ain't rich but stills he borrows your money
And never pays you back
'Cus any penny he gets, he spends on that bad habit
F******' takes the piss bringin' that slut in to our house
Is the ultimate diss
Now I know you threw him out for that
But how long is it gonna be before you take him back?
Mama, know you're lonely but you're the only
One who can't see that this bloke is a phoney
And he don't really care bout ya, mum
He just says he does 'cus he f******' thinks ya dumb

chorus:
Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that

verse 3:
My mama loves a crack head
Is that what I'm supposed to tell my friends?
When they ask me how I'm doing, am I supposed to pretend?
Act like there's nothing's wrong when there blame there is
Turn the other cheek when he's takin' the piss
Fuck that that's not how the man of the house acts
I gotta defend my territory, guard my patch
When I know he's doing doggy shit behind your back
Put my foot down, stand my ground and that
This has got to stop whether the guy buns crack or not
His head ain't there he's f******' lost the plot
Dead and buried is the act phrase can't even act right
Can't even act his age that's so f******' lame
Thirty something years old, he should feel ashamed
If I was him, I'd slit my my veins at the mains
In a lukewarm bath and sit in it till my arteries drain
Do it right this time so I don't have to do it again
'Cos there's nothing more pathetic than a cry for help
Either you do or you don't, wanna kill ya self
Everybody knows you got a problem so it don't matter if you admit it
But what you gotta do is be a man 'n' f******' deal with it
I know the truth hurts, mama
But this shit gotta be said
He don't love you, he never has and that's a fact
The only thing he really loves in this world is crack

chorus:
Mama, can't you see what he's tryin' to do to you and to me?
Mama, it's so black and white
While you're sittin' at home he's out smokin' crack tonight
And I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that, no

I can't go for that, no, no can do
I can't go for that, can't for that, can't go for that, no
I can't go for that---Lyrics submitted by Rhyanna John.
