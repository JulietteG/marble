What was that you said to me a long long time ago
Stuck in my mind, I fell behind
I guess youll never know
Summertime and summers by
The seeds we all must sow
If every days another play
Wheres my Romeo.

When I was bad
You thought I was beautiful
And in a heat wave
I felt so invincible
Id just run
I kept runnin
I was serious
But you were joking

When I was bad
You thought I was dangerous
I could be casual
Or I could be merciless
When I was bold
I was so fabulous
Made you delirious
And breathless

Was I killing time
Still got a wild imagination
Ive come to find I need a little bit of patience
Peace of mind it never comes when you need it now
And its alright you got to cry just a little
And stand in line with all the beggars and the losers
I sit in silence
Pay the devil what I owe him now

Get up get up get up get up do what you feel
what you feel
what you feel
Get up get up get up get up do what you feel

When I was bad
I was oblivious
But I wasnt obvious
I wasnt furious
And on the freeway
Wed crash into other cars
Another innocent accident
Or was I just curious on the inside

Was I killing time
Still got a wild imagination
Ive come to find I need a little bit of patience
Cause peace of mind it never comes when you need it now
And its alright you got to cry just a little
And stand in line with all the beggars and the losers
I sit in silence
Pay the devil what I owe him now

Get up get up get up get up do what you said
Get up get up get up get up do what you said---Lyrics submitted by Eliana Valverde.
