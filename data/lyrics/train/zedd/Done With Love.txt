Baby, if you're done with love, who's gonna hold you tonight?
Are you done with love so they can't hurt you tomorrow?
You don't wanna keep on swimming in the ocean you've cried
But I won't let you drown, I'll pull you back to the shallow

Cause all I ever really wanted
In this short life was you
Tell me who took your heart away
And do you know it breaks mine when I hear you say
That you're done with love?
Oh, you are done with love

Give me one night to mend the pain
Because the second we touch, you'll forget the day
You were done with love
Oh, you were done with love

All I ever really wanted
In this short life was you
All I ever really wanted
In this short life was you

If you're done with love

You think you're done with love
You think you're done with love
You think you're done with love
You think you're done with love---
