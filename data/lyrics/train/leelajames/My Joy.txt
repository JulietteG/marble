Who are you to tell me that I cant go on without you
Why you tellin me I'm never gonna survive
But once upon a time yes I believed that lie (Oh lawd)
But sorry no way no how you can't control my mind

'Cause if I thought you were the end all in my be all
I would've never left you alone and I wouldn't be on my own and I never never woulda grown
no no no aint no way you gone take away 
My joy, my peace, my strength
no no no ain't no way you gone take away
My joy, my peace, my strength

Thank you for the times of all the pain you gave me 
The hate you showed to me taught me how to love myself 
It's funny how you tried to break down my pride and my spirit 
It doesn't even matter now 'cause I done moved on with my life 

Cause if I thought you were the end all in my be all
I would've never left you alone and I wouldn't be on my own and I never never woulda wrote this song
no no aint no way you gone take away 
My joy, my peace, my strength
no no no ain't no way you gone take away
My joy, my peace, my strength
No, aint no way
Vamp: 
Cause If I thought you were the end all in my be all
I woulda never left you alone
and I wouldnt be on my own
naw I never woulda found faith 
and I never would have loved again
If I thought you were my.... end all in my.... be all
I never would have found faith
(never found faith)
I never would have loved again
(never woulda loved again)
and I never would have wrote this song

you cant take away my joy, my joy, my joy
I'm Tellin you
