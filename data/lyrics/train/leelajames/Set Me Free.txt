Uh, uh, uh
Oh, oh, hmm
Listen! Last night you didn't call,
Had me worried all night long
Why you keep doing me wrong?
I don't know, babe!
And it hurts so bad
I'm tired of being sad,
This house is not a home
The love is gone, baby!

I just can't see it,
I can't see, baby!
...staying in this with you
You, you, you!

If you love me
(If you love me)
Set me free,
(Set me free!)
You're just holding to nothing
(You're holding to nothing)
Set me free!
If you love me
Set me free!
Cause I won't hold to nothing
Just set me free if you love me!

If you love me, if you care
Be man enough to let me go instead of staying here
Pretending like we love each other
When we both know there's something better waiting for me
You just can't see it,
I can see, baby
Wasting any more time,
We're just waiting time
Staying in this
And I just can't stay,
I just can't stay with me!

If you love me
(If you love me)
Set me free,
(Set me free!)
You're just holding to nothing
(You're holding to nothing)
Set me free!
If you love me
Set me free!
Cause I won't hold to nothing
Just set me free if you love me!

What happened to the love we have?
It went away somehow
It used to be so good, but it's so bad now
And I tried to make it work,
I tried to fit the play
I give it all I got, can't you understand?

If you love me
(If you love me)
Set me free,
(Set me free!)
You're just holding to nothing
(You're holding to nothing)
Set me free!
If you love me
Set me free!
Cause I won't hold to nothing
Just set me free if you love me!

Set me free, set me free
Let me go cause it's bad for me
We're holding on, we're holding on
Uh, if you love me, let me free!---
