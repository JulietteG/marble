I've read it all, it's black and white
The spectrum made any shade I like
The crimson rays are ruby bright
Technicolor light, ow

(Red!)
I want red, there's no substitute for red
(Red!)
Paint it red, green ain't me compared to red

You don't know what it does to me
My crimson sin intensity
I'm haunted by the mystery
The mystery of red

(Red!)
Knocks 'em dead
Some like it hot, I like it Red

Red is my lover, got it covered
Red is my number, sure is a comer
Red is my drummer, and I hear red thunder
Move over brother, Red's a mother
Ow

Ah (Red! Red!)
(Red! Red!)
Move over brother, move over brother

(Red! Red!)
(Red! Red!)
That's what I said, that's what I said, hey
(Red! Red!)
Come on to bed
(Red! Red!)
Gimme' that expensive spread
(Red! Red!) uh
(Red! Red!) Red, red, red, red, red, red, red
(Red! Red!) ---Lyrics submitted by Greg Summers.
