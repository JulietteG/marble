S. Hagar)

You do what you want to do
I'll leave it all up to you
In time, I'll find love again
Hot love growin cold
Just when you thought you'd found a heart of gold
Looks like, I've been fooled again

Chorus:
Oh but it's all right, with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck, I'm bound to win
And I'll fall in love again
I'll fall in love again

And you're always sittin ring side
Just a rollin' with the changing tide
The tide has washed you from my mind
And I guess you think you've got it made
Oh but then you never were afraid
Of anything that you've left behind

[Chorus]

Yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, yea, I'll fall in love again...

Here's something to compare it to
Like the little things you used to do
Like giving more than you take
Funny how the reasons grow
Then the very next things you know
The odds change, dividing up the cake

[Chorus]

Don't worry 'bout me baby
I'll along somehow
I'll fall in love again
Yes it's all right
Yes it's all right---Lyrics submitted by J.
