a deeper kind of love
has no border lines
no ties...

and a deeper kind of love
can pull you down and lift you up so high...

a phoenix starts to rise from the ashes inside my soul...
leaving old wounds behind
a new me is born...
and you show me your world....

so dangerous, when i let go...
and when i fall, i fall deep
into a deeper kind of love...
a deeper kind of love
can also bring hurt and pain...
ya the shadow that it cast
lies, jealousy, fear and hate...

the more i have to win...
the more i have to lose...
and it is all...
and when i think of loosing you 
and your deeper kind of love
you show me your world...

so dangerous, when i let go
and when i fall, i fall deep
into a deeper kind of love....

a deeper kind of love
has no border lines
no ties...
and a deeper kind of love can pull you down and lift you up so high...
a phoenix starts to rise
from the ashes inside my soul...
leaving old wounds behind
a new me is born and you show me your world...

so dangerous when i let go 
and when i fall, i fall deep...
into a deeper kind of love...
(show me your world)
i wanna deeper kind of love...
(show me your world)
a deeper kind of love...
(show me your world)
i wanna deeper kind of love...
(show me your world)
show me your world...
(show me your world)

i wanna see your world
i wanna see your world baby...
show me your world
i wanna a deeper kind of love
i wanna a deeper kind of love...
show me...
show me your world...
show me your world...
