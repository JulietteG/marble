7 years and 50 days, the time is passing by.
Nothing in this world could be as nice as you and I.
And how could we break-up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days,
And I still sing my song.

Now I run to you, like I always do.
When I close my eyes, I think of you.
Such a lonely girl, such a lonely world,
When I close my eyes, I dream

I return you, like I always do.
When I close my eyes, I think of you.
Such a lonely girl, such a lonely world,
When I close my eyes, I dreamof you.---Lyrics submitted by EmeraldSinger.
