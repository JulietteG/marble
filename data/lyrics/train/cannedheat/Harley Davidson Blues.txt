I've got them broke down Harley Davidson blues

I started out with this basket case
I thought I'd made quite a find
I paid my money and took the thing home
Folks thought I was outta my mind

Cussin' and kickin' I got the thing runnin'
Headed down the road with my motor just a gunnin'
There came a knockin' noise down by my shoe

I've got them broke down Harley Davidson blues.

I pulled off the road and got to a station
No one could figure out what in tarnation
Was makin' that knockin' noise down deep in her soul
So I twisted and tightened and pounded and turned
But the man shook his head and said
"Well, I think she's burned"
Settin by the road with a hadful of screws

I've got the broke down Harley Davidson blues

**musical interlude**

Sittin' by the side ponderin' my fate,
When up pulls a man, and I'm tryin' to look straight.
Walked right up to me with a big old frown on his face
Said, "Boy, you get this here pile of junk
Lowdown rusty pice of funk
Call someone and have it moved from this place.

I've got them broke down Harley Davidson blues

(spoken):
"Say, boy, ehy you got a license?
Sure hope you got papers for that thing!
You don't have no warrants out on ya?"
"Huh?"
"Get this thing outta here---Lyrics submitted by Debbie.
