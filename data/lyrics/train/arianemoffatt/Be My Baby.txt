The night we met I knew I needed you so
and if I had the chance I'd never let you go.
So won't you say you love me,
I'll make you so proud of me.
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go.

Be my, be my baby 
be my little baby 
my one and only baby 
Say you'll be my darlin'
be my, be my baby 
be my baby now
my one and only baby 

I'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see.
For every kiss you give me I'll give you three.
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you.
You know I will adore you 'til eternity.

Be my, be my baby 
be my little baby 
my one and only baby 
Say you'll be my darlin'
be my, be my baby 
be my baby now
my one and only baby 

Be my, be my baby 
be my little baby 
my one and only baby 
Say you'll be my darlin'
be my, be my baby 
be my baby now
my one and only baby---Lyrics submitted by Katy Chartier.
