I just called to let you know Im buckled in my seat
On a jet airliner headed back to Tennessee
Weve been together for years, Im gone for one day
Girl I miss you like I did after our first date
And this crazy love, its strong as it ever was

Baby you still got it and I still want it, uh-huh, oh yeah
Just in case you didnt know it, you got it goin on, oh yeah
Im all yours, youre all mine
Girl you turn me on after all this time
Baby you still got it and I still want it

So baby fire up some candles and turn the lights down low
Dial up something sexy on the radio
I got a bottle of wine, Im almost home
Put one of those silky little nothings on
We can stay up late
We got something to celebrate.

Baby you still got it and I still want it, uh-huh, oh yeah
Just in case you didnt know it, well you got it goin on, oh yeah
Im all yours, and youre all mine
Girl you turn me on after all this time
Baby you still got it and I still want it

Girl you got me hangin on your every kiss
Thats the way it was, thats the way it is

Baby you still got it and I still want it, uh-huh, oh yeah
Just in case you didnt know it, you got it goin on, oh yeah
Im all yours, youre all mine
Girl you turn me on after all this time
Baby you still got it and I still want it
You still got it---Lyrics submitted by tammy harris.
