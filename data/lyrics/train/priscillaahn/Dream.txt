I was a little girl alone in my little world
Who dreamed of a little home for me
I played pretend between the trees
And fed my houseguests bark and leaves
And laughed in my pretty bed of green

I had a dream
That I could fly from the highest swing
I had a dream

Long walks in the dark
Through woods grown behind the park
I asked God who I'm supposed to be
The stars smiled down at me
God answered in silent reverie
I said a prayer and fell asleep

I had a dream
That I could fly from the highest tree
I had a dream

(8x)
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

Now I'm old and feeling grey
I don't know what's left to say
About this life I'm willing to leave
I lived it full and I lived it well
As many tales I lived to tell

I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready now
To fly from the highest wing

I had a dream---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
