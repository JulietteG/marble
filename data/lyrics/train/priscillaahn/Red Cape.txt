I'm alive and I should've died in a plane crash
Four long years ago
Lost my hope, couldn't cope with my fear of 
News on the radio
But I've got a long, red cape
That's caught in the engine of a plane
That's flying way too low

Yesterday a hurricane
Had blown away my long, red cape
And I feel satisfied

I'm at peace I feel sweetly  released from
All that i couldn't let go
If I knew what to do then, I guess I'd
Finally feel at home
But I can't wear my red cape
'Cause I would be repeating a mistake
I just gotta let it go, I just gotta let it go
I just gotta let it go
I just gotta let it go...

Yesterday a hurricane
Had blown away my long, red cape
And I feel satisfied---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
