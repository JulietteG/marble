Do you see me standing there in the corner
I was alone, I always am at these big parties

Watching you, watching everybody
Wishing I was more outgoing
Wishing I was dressed up pretty

Wallflower, I'm not here, no one sees me
Wallflower, I'm by myself, please excuse me

But there you were
Standing in your own corner
Your eyes were wide
Tired, fading, just like mine
We could be the best of friends
I'm sure of it
But I'm too shy to
Cross this crowed room
Besides

Wallflower, I'm not here, no one sees me
Wallflower, I'm by myself, please excuse me

Help me leave this corner of the room
I'm reaching out to you
Cause I've got things
I could talk to you about
And we could be
Wallflower friends 'til the end
Wallflower friends 'til the end
I'm sure of it

Wallflowers, we're not here, no one sees us
Wallflowers, we're together, please excuse us---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
