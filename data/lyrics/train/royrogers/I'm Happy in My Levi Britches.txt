I dont wanna be rich as Rocky-feller
I dont wanna own all of the land
For Im a happy guy in my Levi britches
And my coat of tan.

I dont wanna grow old as Methuselah
I just wanna stay young as I can
For Im a happy guy in my Levi britches
And my coat of tan.

I dont own much that you buy in stores
But Ive got a sky thats sunny
And I own the deed to the great outdoors
It didnt cost me money.

You can have all your riches and your sorrow
I just wanna stay broke as I am
For Im a happy guy in my Levi britches
And my coat of tan.

I dont want to be rich as anybody
All Im needin is something to eat
For Im a hungry guy in my Levi britches
And Im getting weak.

I dont own much that you buy in stores
But Ive got a sky thats sunny
And I own the deed to the great outdoors
It didnt cost me money.

You can have all your riches and your sorrow
I just wanna stay broke as I am
For Im a happy guy in my Levi britches
And my coat of tan.---Lyrics submitted by C Phillips.
