Born to the saddle with the west in my heart,
My eyes to the prairie skies,
With a happy song as i jog along,
Born to the Saddle am i.

Born to the splendor and the charm of the plains,
I'm free as the birds that fly,
And i find romance in the broad expanse,
Born to the Saddle am i.

The life i lead is fine indeed, 
My cares don't mean a thing,
I greet each day with a grin and say it's grand to live and be able to sing.

Born to the saddle with a song on my lips,
In tune with the winds that sigh,
And I'll never change as i ride the range,
Born to the saddle am i.

A rollin' stone that gather's no moss that's me,
I've never known the whip of a boss i'm free,
I'm captain of my destiny and i give the best in me,
I'm out on my own and that's how i like to be.

Born to the saddle with the west in my heart,
My eyes to the prairie skies,
With a happy song as i jog along,
Born to the Saddle am i.

Born to the splendor and the charm of the plains,
I'm free as the birds that fly,
And i find romance in the broad expanse,
Born to the Saddle am i.

The life i lead is fine indeed, 
My cares don't mean a thing,
I greet each day with a grin and say it's grand to live and be able to sing.

Born to the saddle with a song on my lips,
In tune with the winds that sigh,
And I'll never change as i ride the range,
Born to the saddle am i.
