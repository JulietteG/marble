Rocking off the top of my head
You got everything you asked for
Waiting for your next confession
To knock me right to the ground

I could really use a place to go where no one looks or stares
Getting tired of always talking about the things you want to say
I cant hear myself with your hands on my ears but you dont care
But you dont care

I can be a tiger
I can be a fighter
I can be ecstatic
I can be erratic
I can be a rebel
But Im never gonna be anyone but me

Three words that I cant compound with the one thats on your mind
You got all the talking down but I read between your lines

Dont want to be the part of my home town if my heart is in the way
Ive got to trade it with my happiness to make sure I can stay
Now I cant hear myself with your hands covering my ears
I cant fake it, wont you get me out of here

I can be a dreamer
I can be a kill joy
I can be a sweetheart
I can be a nightmare
I can be a rebel
But Im never gonna be anyone but me

Three words that I cant compound with the one thats on your mind
You got all the talking done but I read between your lines

I can be a lover
I can be an angel
I can be a sad girl
I can be a mad girl
I can be a rebel
I can be a jester
I can be a fire
I can be a liar

I never wanna be anyone but me

Three words that I cant compound with the one thats on your mind
Got all the talking down but I read between your lines---
