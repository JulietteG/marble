Well i'd never break your heart, now tell me would you break mine
Re-wind and clean the slate, wipe away the hard times
Well i never did forsake you, and i never would
I got away from the common ground, just because i could
There was a shadow, following me around
Somehow i lost my way, that was then, take a look at me now

Chorus
For everything in life, there is a reason
Sometimes the reason i do, make it not so good

Verse 2

Seems like all that time away took me one step closer to my suicide
Spun around like i jus got played, all caught with the users and the crucified
A shining example of what you never wana be
The fame of teachers drowning in a wishing well
With no apology
Me and my shadow, no-body else around, somehow i lost my way, that was then take a look at me now

Chorus

Short Verse

Feels like the time is right for getting back to even
You are the reason i do, aint that enough for you!

Chorus

Short Verse

Feels like the time is right for getting back to even
You are the reason i do, aint that enough for you
Aint that enough for you
You are the reason i do
Aint that enough for you
ahhhh, take a look at me now---Lyrics submitted by tyler.
