Ive had all I can take, the lyin to my face,
Im tired of the abuse all the excuses that youve made
Therell be no compromise, Ive finally realized
Its time to cut the noose, Im bustin loose and start livin my life

[Chorus]
I dont care what you say, you better get out of my way
Im tired of wastin my time, now Im breakin free!
I always knew the day would come, where everythings comin undone
Now Im breakin free!

Im done with swallowing my pride, and the truth bein denied,
You know it makes me sick how youre so quick to always criticize;
You never find faults in yourself, youre always blamin someone else,
When you know that its you and its true that with you, its just a livin hell!

(Reprise Chorus)

Every time I start feelin down, I know its time that I turn this around
Every time I start thinkin what went wrong;
I cant believe that it was so bad, all the time that you drove me mad,
I cant believe that I stayed with you so long!
