I came, I saw, tore down, those walls
Block one way, Ill find another
You know youll always be discovered
If its me, you choose, I cant lose
Im in love with you, if you love me too, yeah

Dont ever change, and Ill stay the same
Well be swimming in the same direction
And well never lose this connection
Nothing they can do, can stop this army of two
Were marching to the future, yeah its me and you

So just follow my lead, repeat after me
Faith is the bullet, hope is the gun
And love is all we need
Now fears on the run
Weve already won
So march with the band, raise your right hand
And weve only just begun

I took a vow, to never let you down
When its us, there aint no competition
I can be the star, on which youre wishing
I never doubted for a moment its true
I love all of you, if you love me too, yeah
Dont ever change, and Ill stay the same
Well be swimming in the same direction
And well never lose this connection
Nothing they can do, can stop this army of two
Were marching to the future, just me and you

So just follow my lead, repeat after me
Faith is the bullet, hope is the gun
And love is all we need
Now fears on the run
Weve already won
So march with the band, raise your right hand
And weve only just begun

Only just begun, only just begun

Dont ever change, and Ill stay the same
Well be swimming in the same direction
And well never lose this connection
Nothing they can do, can stop this army of two
Cos were marching to the future, yeah its me and you

So just follow my lead, repeat after me
Faith is the bullet, hope is the gun
And love is all we need
Now fears on the run
Weve already won
So march with the band, raise your right hand
And weve only just begun

Its the moment of truth, Im counting on you
This army of two have only just begun
Its the moment of truth, Im counting on you
This army of two have only just begun---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
