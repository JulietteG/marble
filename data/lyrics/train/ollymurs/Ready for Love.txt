There's a line and it's hard to cross
Scared to say the things that we both feel
But all my life I have been so lost
Running from every heart that's real

Now I wanna see the lights
And I wanna see it all
I'm ready for the rise even if we fall
I don't wanna be alone
Wanna wake and see the sun
Darling it has only just begun
And I'll sing it

Shout it out, sing it loud, I've got something to say
You're the one that I want and I'm screaming your name
Can I kiss you? 'Cause the night is closing in
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for it
I come alive, I feel alive when you walk my way
There's a room in my heart, do you wanna stay?
And I'll show you that you're all I'm thinking of
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for love

The doubts you have make you insecure
But I don't mind if you feel unsure
I've heard you say, thinking we've been here before
But close your eyes, and think of it no more

Do you wanna see the lights
Do you wanna see it all
Are you ready for the rise even if we fall
I don't wanna be alone
Wanna wake and see the sun
Cause darling we have only just begun
And I'll sing it

Shout it out, sing it loud, I've got something to say
You're the one that I want and I'm screaming your name
Can I kiss you cause the night is closing in
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for it
I come alive, I feel alive when you walk my way
There's a room in my heart, do you wanna stay
And I'll show you that you're all I'm thinking of
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for love

And I know what we've been through
The hard times, we live and lose
Take my hand and I will lead you to something new
You and I will walk in time
There's no need to run and hide
Take my hand and I will show you my love is true
And I'll sing it

Shout it out, sing it loud, I've got something to say
You're the one that I want and I'm screaming your name
Can I kiss you cause the night is closing in
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for it
I come alive, I feel alive when you walk my way
There's a room in my heart, do you wanna stay
And I'll show you that you're all I'm thinking of
Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for love

Oh I, oh I, I'm ready for love---
