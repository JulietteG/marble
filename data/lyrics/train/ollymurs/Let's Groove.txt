Let's groove tonight
share the spice of life
Baby, slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove, get you to move
It's alright, alright, alright
Let this groove, set in your shoes
Stand up, alright, alright

Gonna tell you what you can do
with my love, alright
Let you know girl you're looking good
You're out of sight. alright

Just move yourself and glide like a 747
And loose yourself in the sky
Among the clouds in the heavens

Let this groove, light up your fuse
It's alright, alright, alright 
Let this groove, set in your shoes
stand up, alright, alright

Lose yourself
Lose yourself, alright

You will find, peace of mind on the floor
Take a little time, come and see, you and me
Give a little sign, I'll be there after a while
if you want my love

We can boogie on down---
