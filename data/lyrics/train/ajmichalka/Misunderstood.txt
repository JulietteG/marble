Under the surface
We're all the same
Searching for purpose
Running from shame

I'm sorry I'm not all the things that you want
All the things that you thought I should be
I guess I'm not like you
Not something you're used to
Maybe something brand new
You've never seen

Wish I could read your mind
Come on let me inside
I'll never waste your time
Misunderstood
Wish you could somehow see
That I will always be
All that you want from me

I've got your letter
Tell me who's to blame
Do you feel better
Causing me pain
So much pain

I'm sorry I'm not all the things that you want
All the things that you thought I should be
I guess I'm not like you
Not something you're used to
Maybe something brand new
You've never seen

Wish I could read your mind
Come on let me inside
I'll never waste your time
Misunderstood
Wish you could somehow see
That I will always be
All that you want from me
Misunderstood

It's my time
It's my turn
And I'm ready
But I need to make this on my own
You're not right I'm not wrong
So just let me go

I'm sorry I'm not all the things that you want
All the things that you thought I should be

Wish I could read your mind
Come on let me inside
I'll never waste your time
Misunderstood
Wish you could somehow see
That I will always be
All that you want from me!!!

You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
You, You've got to let it go

Under the surface
We're all the same ---
