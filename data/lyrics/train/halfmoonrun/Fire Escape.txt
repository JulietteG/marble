Hey Dark Eyes,
Rest with me a while as I drift closer to sleep
Still cannot
Still cannot find no peace

You let go the glass at our feet
It rained through the night
And you, take the fire escape
Run down the street to the church

Hey Murderer,
Killin' keeps us close enough
Hey Murderer,
Every breath you steal is a breath that I breathe for

You let go the glass at our feet
It rained through the night
And you, take the fire escape
Run down the street to the church

You let go the glass at our feet
It rained through the night
And you, take the fire escape
Run down the street to the church---Lyrics submitted by Rene Bernal.
