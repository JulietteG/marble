All the golden soft silk sand
That surround this pretty island
Must have seemed like prison walls, steely bars

In this playground of the rich
All the yachts and champagne lavished
I still see a lonely child watch the stars

All of all your evil deeds, many still condoned
You sent me far cross the sea to be owned

To Hell or Barbados, To Hell or Barbados
To Hell on Barbados we were sent

Its a Heaven on this Earth
A creators work of art
And the sun sets o'er the sea so divine

Then a whiplash licks my heels
And my scorched skin bursts and peels
Though my people were not made for these burning fields

All of all your evil deeds, many still condone
But your crime of slavery goes unknown
Good men like old Wilberforce,,they came far too late
Far too late to save us from the fate

Of Hell or Barbados, Oh Hell or Barbados
To Hell or Barbados we went

To Hell or Barbados, To Hell or Barbados
To Hell on Barbados we were sent

Hold on, no no no no no no
Don't you dare let go of my hand
But they prised us apart, ran a sword through my heart
Sent us on our way

Hold on, no no no no no no
Don't you dare let go of my hand
But they prised us apart, ran a sword through my heart
Sent us on our way

Hold on, no no no no no no
Don't you dare let go of my hand
But they prised us apart, ran a sword through my heart
Sent me on my way

To Hell or Barbados, To Hell or barbados
To Hell on Barbados we went

To Hell or Barbados, To Hell on Barbados
To Hell on Barbados we went---Lyrics submitted by Byron Huxley.
