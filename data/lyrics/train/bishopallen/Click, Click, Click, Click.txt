I had ducked out of the rain
Into Maria's wedding day
And I sat there with her friends
And with her family
And I was happy

I wasn't someone they'd invite
Because I didn't know the groom
Or know the bride
But when I stood next to her brother
For the photograph
He was laughing

Take another picture with your click, click, click, click camera

Sure, I've got pictures of my own
Of the people and the places that I've known
Here's one: I'm carrying your suitcase
Outside of Alphabet City

But in someone else's life
Where Maria is a wife
I'm on the mantle in the corner of the photograph
Smiling pretty

Take another picture with your click, click, click, click camera

Are you tired of where you've gone?
And you think you might belong
In a moment when you step out of the rain?
And you've ended up in someone else's frame?
And they're memory now is never quite the same
And they never even thought to ask your name

Take another picture with your click, click, click, click camera---Lyrics submitted by CHARLIE.
