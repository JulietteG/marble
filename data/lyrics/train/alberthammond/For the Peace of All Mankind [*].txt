You turned me on
So bad
That there was only one thing on my mind
An overnight affair
Was needed at the time
Hello
Goodbye
No searching questions
That was clearly understood
But how was I to know
That you would be so good?

For the peace
For the peace
For the peace of all mankind
Will you go away
Will you go away
Will you vanish from my mind
Will you go away and close the bedroom door
And let everyting be as it was before

Too much
Too soon
Too bad it didn't hit me
Till a week had passed
I might have saved the day
If I had acted fast
I looked around
In case you'd scribbled down
Your number secretly
But all you left
Were fingerprints and memories

For the peace
For the peace
For the peace of all mankind
Will you go away
Will you go away
Will you vanish from my mind
Will you go away and close the bedroom door
And let everyting be it was before

For the peace
For the peace
For the peace of all mankind
Will you go away
Will you go away
Will you vanish from my mind
Will you go away and close the bedroom door
And let everyting be as it was before

For the peace
For the peace
For the peace of all mankind
Will you go away
Will you go away
Will you vanish from my mind
Will you go away and close the bedroom door
And let everyting be as it was before---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
