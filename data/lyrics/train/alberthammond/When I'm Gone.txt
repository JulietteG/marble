When Im gone
Will you take good care of everything
Will you keep wearing your wedding ring
When Im gone

And When Im gone
Will you take out all the photographs
Maybe spend a moment in the past
When Im gone

Will you miss me
In the night
Will your arms reach out to hold me tight
And keep me in your dreams
In your heart
In your life

Sometimes I want to run to you
Like lovers do
When love is new
Just for a moment, be close to you
Pretending Im still holding you

And even when Im far away
The dreams will stay
And someday
After we both chase our fantasies
Love will bring you back to me

When Im gone
Ill be thinking bout you constantly
Cause your locked inside my memories
From now on

And I know
That we said we needed time apart
But your love keeps pulling in my heart
Pulling strong

Will you miss me
In the night
Will your arms reach out to hold me tight
And even in your dreams
In your heart
In your life

Sometimes I want to run to you
Like lovers do
When love is new
Just for a moment
be close to you
Pretending Im still holding you
And even when Im far away
The dreams will stay
And someday
After we both chase our fantasies
Love will bring you back to me

Sometimes I want to run to you
Like lovers do
When love is new
Just for a moment
be close to you
Pretending Im still holding you
And even when Im far away
The dreams will stay
And someday
After we both chase our fantasies
Love will bring you back to me.

Sometimes I want to run to you
Like lovers do
When love is new
Just for a moment
Be close to you
Pretending Im still holding you---Lyrics submitted by collen.
