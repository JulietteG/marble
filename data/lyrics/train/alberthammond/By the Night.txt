Here we are alone now
Love is growing strong now
Feeling so inspired
By the night, by the night 

Looking at the sky at night, everything is peaceful
Welcome to my world
Here there are no strangers
Here there is no danger
I'm happy in my world

Daylight finds me working just to stay alive
But God, you know Im living for the night

Words of love are spoken
Hearts are never broken
Feeling so inspired
By the night, by the night

Put your arms around me
Let your love surround me
Keep me warm inside
Let the sky above us
And the earth below us
Take us through the night

Theres no way of telling just how far were gonna go
But, girl, weve got until the morning light

All the time Im wishing that the night would never end
I just want to keep this love alive

Lay your body down now
Love is all around now
Feeling so inspired
By the night, by the night

By the night, by the night---Lyrics submitted by Lourens.
