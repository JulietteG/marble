Can you feel your heartbeat racing?
Can you taste the fear in her sweat?
You've done this wrong it's too far gone 
These sheets tell of regret
I admit that I'm, I'm just a fool for you
I am just a fool for you

Here is where we both go wrong

Tonight's your last chance to do exactly 
what you want to
And this could be my night
This is what makes me feel alive
Makes you feel alive

Here is where we both go wrong
So tie me up and toss this key
'Cause for now we're living

In this moment that we both ignore the truth
It's all over!
It's all over!

I feel your heart against mine
So take a breath and close your eyes, eyes

(CHORUS)
Your lungs have failed 
and they've both stopped breathing
My heart is dead it's way past beating
Something has gone terribly wrong 
I'm scared, you're scared, we're scared of this
I never thought we'd make it out alive
I never told you but it's all in your goodbyes
It's all in your goodbyes

Well, look who's dying now slit wrists sleeping for
with the girl next door
I always knew you were such a sucker for that
It doesn't matter what you say
You never mattered anyway
I never mattered anyway

In this moment that we both ignore the truth
It's all over
It's all over

I feel your heart against mine
So take a breath and close your eyes, eyes 

(chorus)
your lungs have failed and they both 
stopped breathing my heart is dead  its
way past beating something has gone terribly wrong
i'm scared your scared were scared of this
never thought we could make it out alive never told you
but its all in your goodbyes. its all in your goodbyes

Don't shake, I hate to see you tremble
trembling you've lost your touch haven't you?
I'm so addicted
So addicted

(CHORUS)
your  lungs have failed and they both stopped breathing 
my heart is dead its way past beating
something has gone terribly wrong
You're wrong

(chorus)x2your  lungs have failed  and they both stop breathing
my heart is dead its way past beating 
something has gone terribly wrong 
i'm scared your scared were scared of this
never thought we make it out alive
 never told you but is all in your goodbyes
its all in your goodbyes

i never thought we make it out alive
never thought we make it out alive
never thought we make it out alive

its all in your good byes.---Lyrics submitted by Tanner.
