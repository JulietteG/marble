You always amazed me,
But that's the past
You always amazed me,
But that's the past

I kept silent and it rained for days
My insides were drenched
but i guess that's the part of growing up
I never wanted to learn ( wanted to learn)

and I grew into the man
that you never knew
but I wouldn't be this way
if it wasn't for you
100 thank you's
if this is love
fairy tales never came true
judies are black and in full bloom
and I died in the womb

take it back, all that's gone
it's all still there like you left it
december stayed the same
nothing ever changed but you(nothing ever changed but you)

every dream covered in dents
love can't fly tonight
couples will rest, i'll be sleepless
so cry yourself to sleep
this isnt about broken hearts
this is about me
bending again for nothing (nothing)

id run to you but pain awaits
im coming home
but ill be late
no deeper than imagination can be
sight with nothing to see

whats faith if i cant believe
its everything
a cure but i make it a disease
God take me because i hate me---Lyrics submitted by matthew.
