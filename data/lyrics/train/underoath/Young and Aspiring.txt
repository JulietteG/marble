So lets not even try, 
you're right
Let's ball it up and throw it out the window

It's becoming all so clear in my mind
I've thought this through more like once or twice
I feel that it's my last request to you

Hold your breath,
Bottle it up and save it for the next one
It's safe to say we've been riding this all night

None of us will ever change your mind
It's never safe to rely on borrowed time
Now we're both undone, 
And it's time to open up your eyes.

Consequence, it's our need in times like these
Feeling free,
It's our modern disease

You're a classic disaster,
With a knack of losing your exterior
(I'm so sick) from staring at the mirror

This all needs a break from you,
And i'm used to this

I fear that i am just an end
So you play the mistaken,
And i'll play the victim in our screenplay of desire 
I'm still writing the letters 
I'll never send

Running in circles 
I can't forget how many times
I've played this in my mind,
Feeling Free
(Feeling Free)

Consequence, it's our need in times like these
Feeling free, 
It's a modern disease
You're a classic disaster,
With a knack for losing your exterior. 

(I'm so sick) from staring in the mirror

This is my panic,
This is my call to arms---Lyrics submitted by tyffani.
