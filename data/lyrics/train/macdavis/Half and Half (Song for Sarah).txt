Half the world is world, and half the world is sky,
Half of everything is all that really meets the eye.
Half of me is you, and half of you is me,
Together we are one, and that's the way that it should be.

La la la, la la la, la la la la la la,	[4 times]

Half a song is melody and half a song is words,
Half a song is not a half a song until it's heard.
I can sing the words and you can hum the melody;
Together we can sing a song, and that's how it should be.

La la la, la la la, la la la la la la,	[4 times]

Oh, half the world is day, and half the world is night,
Half the world is black as night and half the world is white.
I have half a handshake; take it and you'll see,
Together we'll be friends, and that's the way that it should be.

La la la, la la la, la la la la la la,	[4 times]

Half the world is world, and half the world is sky,
Half of everything is all that really meets the eye.
Half of me is you, and half of you is me,
Together we are one, and that's the way that it should be.

La la la, la la la, la la la la la la...---Lyrics submitted by Leslie Turriff.
