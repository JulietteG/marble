Went from the east to west
With stories to erase
From my heart, my fingers my face
Ive tried my very best
No matter wherever I am
Theres nothing I can do
Cause my love has only one name
And its you

I believe that some things are destined
Theyre meant to happen
I believe that my heart had choosen
The one in a million
Ive opened all doors and all access
For you to get into
Now this heart is cold and ist homeless
Because of you

Memories forced me to remember
To safe love from anger
I cant stop myself but to wonder
Wished i had been better
Counting the time that Ive wasted
Over someone new
Cause one thing that I ever wanted
Is only you

Its only a matter of time
I know soon I will find
That feeling so close to devine
Someone I can call mine
But silence is pounding in my head
Hit me through and through
What everything fails to forget
Is always you---Lyrics submitted by Sajjad.
