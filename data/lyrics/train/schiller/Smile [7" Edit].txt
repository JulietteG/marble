There is a smile
A smile upon your face
I wonder why
Why you're full of grace
There is a time
My feeling was replaced
I wanna hide
Hide in your embrace...

There is a smile
A smile upon your face
I wonder why
Why you're full of grace
There is a time
My feeling was replaced
I wanna hide
Hide in your embrace...---Lyrics submitted by R.
