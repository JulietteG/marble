Schiller
Breathe
I need a vision,
A straight line back to you.
Just give me a reason
To do what lovers do.

I need to know you.
Don't say you ever did.
And if I could hold you.
It's time to set me free,
It's time to set me free,
It's time to set me free.

I can't breathe my love.
I'm swimming in the dark nearside you.
Can't get you find a friend.
But you've got me lost again.

I can't breathe my love.
We're following the path behind you.
But somehow I'm lost again.
Is this the bitter end? For us.

You could have been some light.
To my reflected moon.
A warmer december.
It keep me cold in june.

We should have get flying.
Rise an distant sky.
But we're winter landed.
Where feelings come to die,
Where feelings come to die.

I can't breathe my love.
I'm swimming in the dark nearside you.
Can't get you find a friend.
But you got me lost again.

I can't breathe my love.
We're following the path behind you.
But somehow I'm lost again.
Is this the bitter end? For us.

I can't breathe,
I can't breathe,
I can't breathe... love.

I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe... looove!

I can't breathe my love.
We're following the path behind you.
But somehow I'm lost again.
Is this the bitter end? For us---Lyrics submitted by Krzysztof.
