Darling you can so unforgiving
you can be so unloving 
you can be misunderstanding
but i don't know how 
to be without your love

so tell me what to do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do 

its another night with the moon in the sky
its another night with that look in your eye
but you still sleep with you back to me
so me and you
or is it me and the moon

oh baby i thought that you forgave me
i thought that you still loved me
don't you need me

i wanted forever forever forever forever forever forever forever forever forever forever forever forever forever forever forever

its another night with the moon in the sky
its another night with that look in your eye
but you still sleep with your back to me 
so me and you
or is it me and the moon

its another night with the moon in the sky
its another night with that look in your eye
but you still sleep with your back to me 
so me and you

its another night with the moon in the sky
its another night with that look in your eye 
but you still sleep with your back to me 
so me and you 
or is it me and the moon---Lyrics submitted by kaylee ann smit.
