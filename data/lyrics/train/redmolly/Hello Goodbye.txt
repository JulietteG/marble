One hello  two goodbyes   its over
No more petals on my four leaf clover
Can't take more of this back and forth romance
He said goodbye that's it were through  
One big heart broke in two
But oh we gave it our best chance

One goodbye two hello's he loves me   
Thank my lucky stars above me
Why did we ever part
We're meant to be  oh yes it's true   
There's no one else but you
At least til we say goodbye again

Well it's on again no it's off again    
He loves me he loves me not
Here we go again say hello again  
But if you say goodbye again             
You'll surely break my heart

This carousel of love keeps spinning       
Did i loose or am i winning
How long can we play this game
We're meant to be oh yes it's true    
There is no one else but you
At least til we say goodbye again

(instrumental break)

Well it's on again no it's off again    
He loves me he loves me not
Here we go again say hello again  
But if you say goodbye again             
You'll surely break my heart

One goodbye two hello's he loves me
Thank my lucky stars above me
Why did we ever part
We're meant to be  oh yes it's true   
There's no one else but you
At least til we say goodbye again
