May I suggest
May I suggest to you
May I suggest this is the best part of of your life

May I suggest
this time is blessed for you
this time is blessed and shining almost blinding bright
just turn your head
and youll begin to see
the thousand reasons that were just beyond your sight

the reasons why
why I suggest to you
why I suggest this is the best part of your life

there is a world
thats been addressed to you
addressed to you, intended only for your eyes
a secret world
a treasure chest to you
of private scenes and brilliant dreams that mesmerize

a tender lovers smile
a tiny babys hands
the million stars that fill the turning sky at night

Oh I suggest
Yes I suggest to you
Yes I suggest this is the best part of your life

There is a hope
thats been expressed in you
the hope of seven generations, maybe more
this is the fate
that they invest in you
its that youll do one better that was done before

inside you know
inside you understand
inside you know whats yours to finally set right

and i suggest
and i suggest to you
and i suggest this is the best part of your life

this is a song
comes from the west to you
comes from the west, comes from the slowly setting sun
this is a song
with a request of you
to see how very short the endless days will run
and when theyre gone
and when the dark descends
wed give anything for one more hour of life

may i suggest
this is best part of your life---Lyrics submitted by Lynn.
