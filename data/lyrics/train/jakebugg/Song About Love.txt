You tell me all the things you do
Tell me that it's up to you
Crying in the peaceful night
Telling all the things you hide
But our there in the future
Maybe you're the rainbow
There's no song without love
With your eyes shut you cry in your bed

Is that all you wanted? Songs about love?
Is that want you hoped you would find
When it's burning inside
But a song about love's not enough
So what do you want
What are you needing?
Songs about memories
That hide and then shatter your mind
Like a constant reminder
I just want to find where you are
I just want to find where you are

I hold you and your eyes fall down
You barely even make a sound
Crying in the peaceful night
Showing all the things you hide
But out there in the future
Maybe you're the rainbow
There's no song without love
With your eyes shut you cry in your bed

Is that all you wanted? Songs about love?
Is that want you hoped you would find
When it's burning inside
But a song about love's not enough
So what do you want
What are you needing?
Songs about memories
That hide and then shatter your mind
Like a constant reminder
I just want to find where you are
I just want to find where you are

I just want to find where you are---
