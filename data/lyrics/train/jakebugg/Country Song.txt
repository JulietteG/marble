Gonna sing you an old country song
From the heart 
So I can cry at night and call you when I'm sad 
When you have gone ridin' so far from me in the trees
So far 

Walking down that old country lane 
Drops of rain 
call upon the ones who call you names
Will I see you again and please just come on back home to me 
So I'm not all alone

Gonna sing you an old country song from the heart 
From the strings of this old rusty guitar---
