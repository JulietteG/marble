I woke up this morning and I'm so far gone
We fell asleep with Skype still turned on
You tell me you want me
You say that it's true
Why am I so scared of falling for you?

'Cause I want your heart
Before I go too far

Can you love me all the way?
I wanna know before I fall
'Cause I know that you like me on the outside
But say that you'll stick with me through it all
Love me all the way
And take me for the girl I am
Baby I'm not asking you for perfect
All that I want is the best you can
Love me all the way

You say that you'd write me a song if you could
You know I don't care if it's any good
You tell me I'm pretty in sweatpants and Uggs
Baby does that mean that it's really love

I've been trying, trying to figure it out
I've been dying just to be with you now
Are you ready, are you ready for me?
Hold tight, steady
C'mon baby

Give me your heart
Before we go too far---
