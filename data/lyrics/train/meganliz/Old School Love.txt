OLD S-C-H-O-O-L

[Verse 1 - Liz:]
On the first day, when you asked me.
If you could have my number in your phone.
Hoping you'd offer your jacket, you never did that.
You didn't even try to walk me home.

Does anybody miss that?
Holding hands in the cinema, dreaming cause I'm missing ya.
I wish that.
We could take it back to how it was.
Like.

[Chorus - Megan & Liz:]
What happened to that Old School Love?
Living through your letters was enough.
What happened to that Old School Love?
I can't keep up, I can't keep up.

What's up with the new school rush?
Guess I'm living in the past, I still like it like that.
I can't keep up, up.
What happened to that Old School;
(OLD S-C-H-O-O-L)
Lo-o-o-ove?
Lo-o-o-ove; Lo-o-o-ove.

[Verse 2 - Megan:]
When you took me, to the party.
You told me it was gonna be a date.
Then you had the nerve to ask me, if we could go steady.
Now I'm sorry but it's getting kinda late.

Does anybody miss that?
Having lunch in the park.
Hold my hand in the dark.
I wish that.
We could take it back to how it was.
Like.

[Chorus - Megan & Liz:]
What happened to that Old School Love?
Living through your letters was enough.
What happened to that Old School Love?
I can't keep up, I can't keep up.

What's up with the new school rush?
Guess I'm living in the past, I still like it like that.
I can't keep up, up.
What happened to that Old School;
(OLD S-C-H-O-O-L)
Lo-o-o-ove?
Lo-o-o-ove; Lo-o-o-ove.

What happened to that Old School Love?
Living through your letters was enough.
What happened to that Old School Love?
Oh whoa.

[Chorus - Megan & Liz:]
What happened to that Old School Love?
Living through your letters was enough.
What happened to that Old School Love?
I can't keep up, I can't keep up.

What's up with the new school rush?
Guess I'm living in the past, I still like it like that.
I can't keep up, up.
What happened to that Old School;
(OLD S-C-H-O-O-L)
Lo-o-o-ove?
Lo-o-o-ove; Lo-o-o-ove.
Oh.
