Black and white, all I see
Is a silent movie, and I'm stuck inside the scene
And I saw you, and the color came through
And I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm doing it with you

You one in infinity

I've a lot to say, and you'll listen
When I go away, you're still missing me, missing me
We lay around the house doin' nothing
But you've got a way of makin' it something I've never felt before
And they don't make boys like you anymore

Boys like you du-du doo doo doo
Boys like you

You hold my hand, you're my best friend
You know everything about, you don't care if I'm a mess
Even when I'm not my best you make me better
Couldn't ask for anything more, you never give any less

I've a lot to say, and you'll listen
When I go away, you're still missing me, missing me
We lay around the house doin' nothing
But you've got a way of makin' it something I've never felt before
And they don't make boys like you anymore

Boys like you du-du doo doo doo
Boys like you

We meet a thousand people every single day
And there's a million reasons why you shouldn't stay
But some things are meant to be

You one in infinity

You've a lot to say, and I'll listen
When you go away, I'll be missing you, missing you
We lay around the house doin' nothing
But you've got a way of makin' it something I've never felt before
And they don't make love like this
No they don't make boys like you anymore

Love like this, boys like you du-du doo doo doo---Lyrics submitted by TawanaClem.
