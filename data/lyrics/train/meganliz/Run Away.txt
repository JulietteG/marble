I'm ready to go.
I'm ready to climb, I've quietly been reading your mind.
I don't need a thing, I'm writing a book. 
This story has really got me hooked.
It's amazing the changes I been feeling

I'm dreaming, the best thing in the world was someone like you.
I've been tumbling , shaking. and my whole world is brakeing 
Want to put it together.

And if we run away, Run away now we wont ever look back
And if we run away, Run away now we wont ever look back

We'll run run run away.
Run run run away.
Run run run away

Follow the wind i'm up for a spin.
Feel perfect in the arms im in.

And we're taking flight the whole world is right. I hope we're in the air all night.

It's amazing the change I've been feeling.
I'm dreaming the best thing in the world was someone like you 
I've been tumbling shaking and my whole world is brakeing 
Want to put it together

And if we run away, Run away now, We wont ever look back
And if we run away, run away now, we wont ever look back

We'll run run run away.
Run run run away
Run run run away
(We'll run away)

Even Mountains high, and river far and wide (We'll run away)
I can cross it all with you by my side (We'll run away)

Every step I take 
We're moving every day!

It's amazing the changes I've been feeling.
I'm dreaming of the best thing in the world was someone like you
I've been tumbling shaking, now my whole world is braking 
Want to put it together.

And if we run away, Run away now, we wont ever look back
And if we run away, run away now, We wont ever look back.

We'll run run run away
Run run run away
Run run run away
 We'll Run run run away
Run run run away....---Lyrics submitted by Jordynn Reiger.
