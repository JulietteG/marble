You woke up, head aches
Car won't start and you're already late
So you drove fast, too fast
Yeah, that was a cop you passed

Teacher pulled a pop quiz, that's right
Probably shoulda told ya wish you
Studied last night
So you head out lunch time
Nevermind your cards declined

When life gets this rough
Don't need to be so tough

This time
This time
Everything
Everything will be alright
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm gonna be your hero
Putting on my best dress
So baby don't stress
I'll be your Princess Charming

You had a bad day, today
Lost homecoming game
You're the one to blame
Called your best friend
But he bailed
Straight to voicemail

When life gets this rough
Don't need to be so tough

This time
This time
Everything
Everything will be alright
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm gonna be your hero
Putting on my best dress
So baby don't stress
I'll be your Princess

I know it's not the way
The story usually goes
I'm gonna sweep you off your feet
Make your heart skip a beat
If you've read the fairytales
Where the boy saves the girl
Just stop
Cuz it's not the way it has to be

This time
This time
Everything
Everything will be alright
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm gonna be your hero

This time
This time
Everything
Everything will be alright
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm gonna be your hero
Putting on my best dress
So baby don't stress
I'll be your Princess
I'll be your Princess

This time
This time
Everything
Everything will be alright
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm gonna be your hero
Putting on my best dress
So baby don't stress
I'll be your Princess Charming ---Lyrics submitted by Megan Grant.
