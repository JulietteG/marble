oooh wowowowowowoya, lemme tell ya, wowowowowowoy, ooooh

Keep running but I'm getting nowhere,
Keep climbing but I'm falling down,
Keep knocking but the door won't open for me,

Said I keep on asking, 
Questions are all around, 
The answers cannot be found, 
I talk but they hear no sound,

That ain't the way it's supposed to be,
The more I look the less I see,

CHORUS

There's got to be a way
To brighten up tomorrows
There's got to be a change
The change is gonna come
There's got to be a day
When I can lay my troubles down
There's got to be a way

wowowowowowoy, ooooh, wowowowowowoy, ooooh

Trying to keep my head above the water,
But the current wants to pull me down,
I gotta find a way to reach the shore,

They say a drowning man,
Either sinks or swims,
Clutches for anything,
When his future is looking grim,

That ain't the way it's supposed to be, now,
The more I learn the less I know,

CHORUS x2, with the second chorus having "brighten my tomorrows" instead of "brighten up tomorrows" and inserting "I know" before "a change is gonna come",

Searching for something that I can't find,
Clinging onto dreams so fragile,
In the hope the day will change in time,

Say goodbye to sad tomorrows,
Lay my troubles down,
Cos the change has gotta come,

There's got to be a way,
To brighten up tomorrow,
There's got to be a change
I know I know a change is gonna come,
There's got to be a day
When I can lay my troubles down,
There's got to be a way
There's got to be, there's got to be, there's got to be sweet refrains,

There's got to be a way,
Cos I know that change is gonna come,
There's got to be a change,
No more crying in the streets,
There's got to be a day,
Where we'll all lay our troubles down 
There's got to be a way
