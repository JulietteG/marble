I was so in love with you
There was nothing I could do
Wouldn't give me the time of day
Now you wanna be with me
You say you wanna be with me

You said I was the best
Gave your love out to the rest
There was nothing I could say
But now it's going good for me
You say you wanna be with me
Now

Yeah, you're telling me that I am where it's at
But I ain't having none of that....

[Chorus:]
Because I told you, you'd live to regret it,
and now I don't wanna make you feel bad,
But when it comes to me just forget it,
I'll be the best you never had,
You put me through so many emotions,
Now baby it's your turn for that,
'cause in your empty heart I have left a mark,
The best you never had.

No, No, No

You saw me as a friend,
Baby I don't want revenge,
But if you must know the truth,
What you didn't see in me
Reflects what you will never be now,
When you're telling me I was always the one,
I feel your desperation.

[Chorus]

Back rubs, good love, my stuff
That's what you missed out on
My touch... so much we could have
You miss,
My kiss,
My lips,
The love I had for you
Our song, so long

[Chorus x2]

Well I will always be the best you never had

The best you never had---Lyrics submitted by Allyson.
