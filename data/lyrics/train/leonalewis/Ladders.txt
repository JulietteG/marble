Down here in the trenches
I know what I'm fighting for
Come back to my senses
I'm ready for something more

I can face all of my mistakes
I'll be brave
It's okay, found a way
By the way, I'm away

I fall back down but I'm looking up
Each heart breaks and I'm up the ladder
You're there to lift me up, lift me up
Higher
Higher

No glory in silence
I'm trying to live out loud
Rise up though I'm crying
I'm free, let the fear run out

I can face all of my mistakes
I'll be brave
It's okay, finally I'm awake
I'm away

I fall back down but I'm looking up
Each heart breaks and I'm up the ladder
You're there to lift me up, lift me up
Higher

I fall back down but I'm looking up
Each heart breaks and I'm up the ladder
You're there to lift me up, lift me up
Higher
Higher
Higher

Wherever you take me
You will not beat me
Finally I'm where I belong
Wherever you take me
You elevate me
Finally I am not alone

You're there to lift me up, lift me up
Higher

(I fall back down) I fall back down but I'm looking up
Each heart breaks and I'm up the ladder
You're there to lift me up, lift me up (you're lifting me up)
Higher
Higher
Higher

You're lifting me up
Higher
So high, so high---
