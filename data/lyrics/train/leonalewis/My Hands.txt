I wake in the morning
Tired of sleeping
Get in the shower
And my make my bed alone
I put on my make up
Talk into the mirror
Ready for a new day
Without you
And i walk steady on my feet
I talk my voice obeys me

I go out at night
Sleep without the lights
And i do all of the things i have to
Keeping you on my mind
But when i think I'll be alright
I am always wrong 
'Cause


My hands
Don't wanna start again
My hands
No they don't wanna understand
My hands
They just shake it 
Try to break whatever piece i may find
My hands
They only agree to hold
Your hands
And they don't wanna be without
Your hands
And they will not let me go
No they will not let me go


I talk about you now
And i do without crying
I go out with my friends now
I stay home all alone
And i don't see you everywhere
And i can say your name easily
I laugh bit louder
Without you

And i see different shades now
And i, I'm almost never afraid now
But when i think i'll be ok
I am always wrong 
'Cause


My hands
Don't wanna start again
My hands
No they don't wanna understand
My hands
They just shake it try to break whatever piece i may find
My hands
They only agree to hold
Your hands
No they don't wanna be without
Your hands
And they will not let me go
No they will not let me go


Sometimes i wake
I see them reaching out for you
Quietly break
whatever shields i spent so long building up
I cannot fake
Cause when they cry i'm almost broken 
They miss holding my baby

My hands, My hands

No they don't wanna understand
They just shake it try to break whatever piece i may find


My hands
Your hands
They don't wanna be without 
And they will not let me go
No they will not let me go---Lyrics submitted by Mimi.
