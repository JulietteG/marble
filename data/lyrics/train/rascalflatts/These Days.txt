Hey baby, is that you 
Wow, your hair got so long 
Yeah, yeah I love it, I really do 
Norma Jean, ain't that the song we'd sing 
In the car driving downtown 
Top down, making the rounds 
Checking out the bands on Doheny Avenue 

Yeah, life throws you curves 
But you learned to swerve 
Me, I swung and I missed 
And the next thing you know, I'm reminiscing 
Dreaming old dreams 
Wishing old wishes 
Like you would be back again 

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain 
I put on that old song we danced to and then 
I head off to my job, guess not much has changed 
Punch the clock, head for home, check the phone just in case 
Go to bed, dream of you 
That's what I'm doing these days 
Yeah, that's what I'm doing 

Someone told me after college 
You ran off to Vegas 
You married a rodeo cowboy 
Wow, that ain't the girl I knew 
Me, I've been a few places 
Mostly here and there once or twice 
Still sorting out life but I'm doing alright 
Yeah, it's good to see you too 

Well hey girl you're late 
And those planes, they don't wait 
But if you ever come back around 
This sleepy old town 
Promise me you'll stop in 
To see an old friend 
And until then 

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain 
I put on that old song we danced to and then 
I head off to my job, guess not much has changed 
Punch the clock, head for home, check the phone just in case 
Go to bed, dream of you 
That's what I'm doing these days... 

These days... 

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain 
I put on that old song we danced to and then 
I head off to my job, guess not much has changed 
Punch the clock, head for home, check the phone just in case 
Go to bed, dream of you 
That's what I'm doing these... 

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain 
I put on that old song we danced to and then 
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain 
I put on that old song we danced to and then 
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain 
I put on that old song we danced to and then---
