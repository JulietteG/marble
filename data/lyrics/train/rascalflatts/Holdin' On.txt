There's a mountain dew can
With lipstick on it
Rollin' around his truck bed
He just leaves it back there
One of the things he has left of her

When he drives into the late day sun
You can see a set of footprints
He ain't gonna clean that windshield
He'd rather just live with the hurt

He's holdin' on to the wheel 
On to the way she made him feel
On to the shifter, on to the pictures
Every precious moment with her
Like the left behind colors in the sky
When the sun is gone
He's holdin' on

Oh, hes holdin' on

There's a voicemail on his cell phone
He don't dare erase
She ended with "I love you"
And he saves it just in case it  
Might still be true
No, he ain't through

He's holdin' on to the wheel 
On to the way she made him feel
On to the shifter, on to the pictures
Every precious moment with her
Like the left behind colors in the sky
When the sun is gone
He's holdin' on

To the past
To the last time he held her
Her breath on his neck
The three words she said
Oh -

He's holdin' on to the wheel
On to the way she made him feel
On to the shifter,
On to the pictures
Every precious moment with her
He's holdin' on
Yeah, he's holdin' on and on
He's holdin' on, he's holdin' on---Lyrics submitted by Arielle.
