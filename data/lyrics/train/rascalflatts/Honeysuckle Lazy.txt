Hot spell, summer breeze
Blowin' through the wind chimes
Porch swing, you and me
Coakin' up some down time
That creakin' chain
What a perfect hang

That hummingbird sippin'
We out here day trippin'
I'm gettin' high gettin' sugar from my baby
Sweet iced tea tippin'
Pink shoulder strap slippin'
Hot afternoon drippin'
Honeysuckle lazy
(Honeysuckle lazy)

Heartbeat nice and slow
Kinda like those fan blades
Dryin' off your painted toes
Up here in the cool shade
Steal another kiss
It don't get no better than this, no

That hummingbird sippin'
We out here day trippin'
I'm gettin' high gettin' sugar from my baby
Sweet iced tea tippin'
Pink shoulder strap slippin'
Hot afternoon drippin'
Honeysuckle lazy

Steal another kiss, hey girl
It don't get no better than this, no
It's honeysuckle lazy

Ain't got no plans, naw
Nothin' other than

That hummingbird sippin'
We out here day trippin'
I'm gettin' high gettin' sugar from my baby
Sweet iced tea tippin'
Pink shoulder strap slippin'
Hot afternoon drippin'
Honeysuckle lazy
(Honeysuckle lazy)

It's honeysuckle lazy
Ooh, it's drippin' honeysuckle lazy
Woah it's honeysuckle lazy
That pink shoulder strap slippin'
Hot afternoon drippin'
It's honeysuckle lazy
Honeysuckle lazy
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ---
