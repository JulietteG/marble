everybody needs it
everybody wants it
everybodys searching for someone
been down a thousand highways ive never thought would end
but baby ive been 

waitin all my life to find you 
always been one step behind you
your love babe ive been waitin all my life

i was tired of waitin
every night was praying 
every day would be the day i'd find you
i was grew impatient 
how long woud it take to know
you were out there some where,
some where waitin
wonderin  just like me

i been waitin all my life to love you
all that time i was dreaming of you
your love babe, i've been waitin all my life

did i lose faith(did i lose faith)
did i lose hope(did i lose hope)
maybe i did but i never lost my way to where you are

waitin all my life to find you 
always been one step behind you
your love babe ive been waitin all my life

i been waitin all my life to love you
all that time i was dreaming of you
your love babe, i've been waitin 
your love ive been waitin 
your love ive been waitin all my life
all my life(waitin all my life)
all my life(waitin all my life)---Lyrics submitted by Jessie.
