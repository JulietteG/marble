Drivin' me crazy, baby, playin' me like a joke
You got me trippin' while you're sippin' on that Jack and Coke
Fallin' in love, so baby, just give it up, just give it up
I see you smilin' tryin' to make a fool out of me
I'm spendin' money on ya like I won the lottery
I want your love, baby, just give it up, give it up

You got my heart cold stoppin' every time you walk into the room, yes you do
You got my big mouth droppin' every time I stop and look at you

Girl you're turnin' me on
Better sound the alarm
'Cause this whole place is going up
Girl you got the heat on
With your glass half gone
What you got is so hot to the touch
You're burnin' up and
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Shot you a look and I took you away from the crowd
This place is crazy, baby, tell me can ya hear me now
I want your love, baby, just give it up, just give it up

You got my heart cold stoppin' every time you walk into the room, yes you do
You got my big mouth droppin' every time I stop and look at you

Girl you're turnin' me on
Better sound the alarm
'Cause this whole place is going up
Girl you got the heat on
With your glass half gone
What you got is so hot to the touch
You're burnin' up and
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire
You're burnin' up and
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire
Ooh

I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Girl you're turnin' me on
Better sound the alarm
'Cause this whole place is going up
Girl you got the heat on
With your glass half gone
What you got is so hot to the touch
You're burnin' up and
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire
You're burnin' up and
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Drivin' me crazy, baby, playin' me like a joke
You got me trippin' while you're sippin' on that Jack and Coke
Fallin' in love ---
