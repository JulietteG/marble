"Well I'm dead! Tell the world" she said.
And the funeral came alive.
I collect every flower sent from hell down to the fire.

Fall down, I'm not insane. (I'm felling oh so full of shame.)
Death has come to set us free. (Come set me free)

Oh, it's up to me to make you fucking bleed.
We are the scavengers,
the scavengers of Damned.

We kill, we're the demons still, in an empty, patterned sky.
Well goodbye, to all the lives I stole.
And the funeral came alive.

Fall down, I'm not insane. (I'm felling oh so full of shame.)
Death has come to set us free. (Come set me free)

Oh, it's up to me to make you fucking bleed.
We are the scavengers,
the scavengers of Damned. (We are on a mission to fight you back to hell.)

Fall down, I'm not insane. (I'm felling oh so full of shame.)
Death has come to set us free. (Come set me free.)

Oh, it's up to me to make you fucking bleed.
We are the scavengers,
the scavengers of Damned. (We are on a mission to fight you back to hell.)

If you want love (Hey, hey)
If you crave death (Hey, hey)
Then find, us out of the darkness. (Hey, hey.)

If you want love (Hey, hey)
If you crave death (Hey, hey)
Then find, us out of the darkness. (Hey, hey.)

Oh, it's up to me to make you fucking bleed.
We are the scavengers,
the scavengers of Damned. (Ahh)

Oh, it's up to me to make you fucking bleed.
We are the scavengers,
the scavengers of Damned. (We are on a mission to fight you back to hell.)

Oh, it's up to me to make you fucking bleed.
We are the scavengers,
the scavengers of Damned. (We are on a mission to fight you back to hell.)

Oh, it's up to me to make you fucking bleed.
We are the scavengers,
the scavengers of Damned. (Ahh)
