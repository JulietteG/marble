This is for the godless and villify
This is the godless
This is for the faithless soul to blast up humankind
This is for the godless and terrify
This is the godless
The end of the human race .

We laugh
Yeah Im not afraid to die
I just stop breathing
Cant wake up wake up
Im not afraid to die

This is for the godless and villify
This is the godless
This is for the human race, they start to exterminate

We laugh
Yeah Im not afraid to die
I just stop breathing
Cant wake up wake up
Im not afraid to die

This is a call for every kid on the streets  shelter
Till we gain . we need  divine picture . instruction
It were given to you all back
 in the desert two thousand f*cking years ago
This song  that I can say no war


Yeah Im not afraid to die
I just stop breathing
Cant wake up wake up
Im not afraid to die

Yeah Im not afraid to die---Lyrics submitted by serena.
