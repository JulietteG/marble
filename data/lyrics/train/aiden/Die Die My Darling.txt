Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seeing you again
Yeah, I'll be seeing you, in hell

So don't cry to me oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box-yeah
Don't cry to me oh baby
You should have seen it a-coming on-coming
Don't cry to me oh baby
I don't know it was in your power
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end girl  for a dead-end guy
Don't cry to me oh baby
And now your life drains on the floor
Don't cry to me oh baby

Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seeing you again, 
I'll be seeing you, in hell

Don't cry to me oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me oh baby
You should have seen it a-coming on-coming
Don't cry to me oh baby
I don't know it was in your power
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end girl for a dead-end guy
Don't cry to me oh baby
And now your life drains on the floor
Don't cry to me oh baby

Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you, in hell

Don't cry to me oh baby
Die die die my darling
Die die my darling 
Die die die my darling

Shut your pretty mouth

Die die die my darling
Die die my darling
Die die die my darling
Die die my darling
Die die die my darling
Die die my darling

Die-die-die
Die-die-die
Die-die-die
