Ive been restless on the inside
wondering about this heart of mine
Ive been desperately trying to find
a way to prove that Im still alive
Has the love I speak so loudly of
quietly grown cold

Is my life been an empty voice
what I sing needs to be seen
I need to step out and make the choice
to let go of everything

Would you reignite this heart spark here in the dark

Bring your love to life inside of me
Why dont you break my heart til it moves my hands and feet

For the hopeless and the broken
for  the ones that dont know that you love them
Bring your love to life inside of me

The generation youre calling out
living everything we sing about
The revelation right here and now
love beyond the shadow of the doubt
Love that is greater than our own
wont remain unknown

When you bring your love to life inside of me
Why dont you break my heart til it moves my hands and feet

For the hopeless and the broken
for  the ones that dont know that you love them
Bring your love to life inside of me

love come to life
love come to life
bring love to life inside me

love come to life
love come to life
bring love to life inside me

love come to life
love come to life
bring love to life inside me

love come to life
love come to life
bring love to life inside me

Bring your love to life inside of me
Why dont you break my heart til it moves my hands and feet

For the hopeless and the broken
for  the ones that dont know that you love them
Bring your love to life inside of me

Bring your love to life inside of me
Why dont you break my heart til it moves my hands and feet

For the hopeless and the broken
for  the ones that dont know that you love them
Bring your love to life inside of me

love come to life
love come to life
bring love to life inside me

love come to life
love come to life
bring love to life inside me

love come to life
love come to life
bring love to life inside me

love come to life
love come to life
bring love to life inside me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
