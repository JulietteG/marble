Seems like all I can see was the struggle
Haunted by ghosts that lived in my past
Bound up in shackles of all my failures
Wondering how long is this gonna last
Then You look at this prisoner and say to me son
stop fighting a fight thats already been won

I am redeemed, You set me free
So Ill shake off theses heavy chains
Wipe away every stain now Im not who I used to be
I am redeemed

All my life I have been called unworthy
Named by the voice of my shame and regret
But when I hear You whisper, Child lift up your head
I remember oh God, Youre not done with me yet

I dont have to be the old man inside of me
Cause his day is long dead and gone
Ive got a new name, a new life Im not the same
And a hope that will carry me home---
