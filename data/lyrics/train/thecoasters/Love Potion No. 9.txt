I took my troubles down to Madam Rue
You know that gypsy with the gold tattoo
She's got a pad down on 34th and Vine
And seven little bottles of love potion #9

I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I've been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said what you need is love potion #9

She bent down and turned around and give me a wink
She said I'm gonna mix it up right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine and looked like Indian ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night 
I started kissin' everything in sight 
But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine
He broke my little bottle of love potion #9

(instrumental)

She bent down and turned around and give me a wink
She said I'm gonna mix it up right here in the sink
It smelled like turpentine and looked like Indian ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night 
I started kissin' everything in sight 
But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine
He broke my little bottle of love potion #9
     love potion #9
     love potion #9---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
