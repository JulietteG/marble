There's a whiteness, in the half light, of a new night, when the day is done.
And her soft skin, has a warm glow, and I do know, I'm the lucky one.
In a small boat, on a calm sea, I can only looking old
At the gray cliffs, and a seal pup, as it swims up, to the shore

There's an old pond, in a tree shade, and a bed made, from a pile of hay.
And I lie there, till the words come, if they don't come, I'll lie there anyway.
Near the old docks, by the gas works, where the monsters pick up sticks.
In the old house, cross the main road, cording truckloads Lego bricks.

(Chorus)
These are the things I remember
These are moments I'll treasure
These are the pictures I will paint myself
At the ringing of the bell.

There are high hopes, in a high chair, sitting in there, is a king to be.
And he's smiling, his little heart out, as he holds out his little arms to me
And the long walks, in the sunshine, and the red wine on my tongue
How the sand runs, through my fingers, how it lingers till its cold.

(Chorus) ---
