Long lives the fear
we'll be forgotten
It's a sad sad world we're in
to not believe something
And we'll stop the world from falling
just to stay alive
And I say don't ask me why
do I disbelieve, tell me

Everyone is telling us
something's wrong with us
Everyone is saying
we're lost somehow
I wanna know
Do you believe in something
Everyone seems to have lost themselves

I just need a sign
that we have found one voice
Cause it's a mad mad world I see
to end up with nothing
So we fight for what is right
with no compromise
And I say please ask me why
I believe in living, tell me

Everyone is telling us
something's wrong with us
Everyone is saying
we're lost somehow (oh)
I wanna know
Do you believe in something
Everyone seems to have lost themselves---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
