I look at the starnight
I am shattered byt the night 
always run where I can
And I hide where I wanna hide

But it feels so right 
I want tonight 
It feels so right 

I went out of my mind
I am calling one more time 
I know how it feels tonight
I can do nothing right 

But it feels so right 
I want tonight 
It feels so right 

Oh I will wait to love you 
I will wait another day 
for you to leave all this behind 
you 
I will wait for you tonight 
Will waste another dream of you 
Always run to 
you 

I will take the long rosd 
but it leads right back to you 
If only you'll do the same 

But it feels so right 
I want it tonight 
It feels so right

Oh i  will wait to love you 
I will wait another day 
for you I'll leave all this behind 
you 
I will wait for you tonight 
I Will waste another dream of you 
Always run to 
you 

Oh i  will wait to love you 
I will wait another day 
for you I'll leave all this behind 
you 
I will wait for you tonight 
I Will waste another dream of you 
Always run to 
you---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
