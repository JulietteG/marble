Exaltation, my God of salvation
The field and there in will be filled with jubilation
The lord reigns will be proclaimed amongst the Nations
We don't have no time for patience

Heavens rejoice and the earth will exalt
Oh no, come swing back like a catapult
The sea and its fullness will roar
He is our help and our shield our soul yearns for the lord
Burning God of Yaacov everlasting stronghold
Break down the door I can't hold back no more
Wait all night long, until the early morning
Like night watchmen wait for the dawning

Chorus

Arise, be our help
Place my trust in your kindness
It's a must hoping in the God of deliverance
Since way back when before time began
Existing eternally, everlasting, rejoice in the name of his majesty so we sing

Chorus

Chant sweet melodies, utter hymns and sing praise to his name
For he's alone exalted holy,
Performing mighty deeds and making new things,
Sowing righteousness and creating healing
He spoke, the world came into being
Master of praise, renews each day
Redeems and saves, continuously, blessed is his name
Making great lights, creating luminaries
Abounding in mercy
Won't you grant me?
Understanding
To perceive, all the teachings in your Torah of love, existing eternally, lead me---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
