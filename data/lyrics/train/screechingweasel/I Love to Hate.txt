Love to hate, I love to hate
Your head on my dinner plate

I love to hate, I love to hate
A feeling that is really great

I'm bored when I am not perturbed
No fun unless I'm quite disturbed

I don't need a reason, fuck that shit
No matter what, I'll have a fit

I love to hate you!
I love to hate you!

Love to hate, I love to hate
Deck the halls with Sharon Tate
Love to hate, I love to hate
Assassinate, decapitate

I need a dog that I can kick
I need someone to make me sick

The girl who fills me with disgust
Will be the object of my lust

I love to hate you!
I love to hate you!

I love to hate you!
I love to hate you!
Love to hate you!
I love to hate you!
I love to hate you---Lyrics submitted by Steve Weiser.
