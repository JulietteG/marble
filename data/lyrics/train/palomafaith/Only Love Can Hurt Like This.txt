I'd tell myself you don't mean a thing,
But what we got cannot hold on me?
But when you're not there I just crumble
I tell myself that I don't care that much,
But I feel like I'm dying till I feel your touch

Only love, only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this
Must have been a deadly kiss
Only love can hurt like this

Say I wouldn't care if you walked away,
But everytime you're there I'm begging you to stay,
When you come close I just tremble
And everytime, everytime you go,
It's like a knife that cuts right through my soul

Only love, only love can hurt like this
Only love can hurt like this,
Must have been a deadly kiss,
Only love can hurt like this,
only love can hurt like this

Your kisses burning to my skin,
Only love can hurt like this
And it's the sweetest pain,
Burning hot through my veins,
Love is torture makes me more sure

Only love can hurt like this,
only love can hurt like this,
Must have been the deadly kiss,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this,
Your kisses burning to my skin,
Only love can hurt like this,
Only love can hurt like this,
And it must have been the deadly kiss---
