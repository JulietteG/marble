Ah know what's wrong with me
I got no vision see
I was the target of notion of submission see
Oh yeah they needed me
Yeah I was the target see
They tried to stick a dead body inside of me

No need
No need alibi
Honestly
I tell no lies
Wanted to stick a office worker inside of me

But I kept breaking free 
They could not capture me
I pulled maneuvers they were closer to savage see

Bad bad
They tried to stick a dead body inside of me
Bad bad
Come again I tell no lies

So now you understand
I was a wanted man
The opposition and the bug of a shiny hand
But ah no this I see
There's nothing wrong with me
There's no deadbeat regime rider inside of me

No need
No need alibi
Honestly
I tell no lies
Tired to stick a office worker inside of me

No need
No need alibi
Honestly
I tell no lies
Wanted nothing stuck in me

Bad bad
They tried to stick a dead body inside of me
Bad bad
Wanted nothing stuck in me---
