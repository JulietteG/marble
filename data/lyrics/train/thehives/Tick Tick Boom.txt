Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was right all along
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you come taggin' along

Yeah, exhibit A, on the tray, what you say?
As I throw it in your face
Yeah, exhibit B, what you see? Well that's me,
I put it back in your place

Yeah, I done it before and I can do it some more
So what you waiting for?

Yeah, I was right all along

'Cause I have done it before and I can do it some more
I got my eye on the score 
I'm gonna cut to the core
It's too late it's too soon or is it?
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, boom

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was right, you were wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, going, going you're gone

I saw your hesitating, waiting too much
'till it slipped through your hands
and then you stagger to your feet and out the door
'cause there's not second chance

That's right!

'Cause I have done it before and I can do it some more
I got my eye on the score 
I'm gonna cut to the core
It's too late it's too soon or is it?
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, boom

Check it

And you come crying to me - but it's too late
the man you try hard to be - but it's too late
get your head out the sand - but it's too late
it's too late, too late, too late, too late

Oh yeah, but it's too late
Yeah, but it's too late
get your head out the sand, it's too late 
It's too late, too late

You know I've done it before and I can do it some more
I got my eye on the score 
I'm gonna cut to the core
I'm gonna cut to the core
It's too late it's too soon
It's too late it's too soon
It's too late it's too soon

Or is it?
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, boom---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
