Don't worry sweet baby!
Don't you ever worry 'bout a thing.
Put them worries on the shelf 'n' learn to love yourself
Don't be your own worst enemy.

Hang loose, hang loose
Let the ocean worry 'bout bein' blue.
Hang loose, hang loose.
Go with the tide and I'ma take care of you.

Come with me sweet darlin'.
I got a seat ya ticket for the plane.
We gonna fly to Waikiki, it'll just be you 'n' me.
And we'll let the sun melt our cares away. 

Hang loose, hang loose.
Let the ocean worry 'bout bein' blue.
Hang loose, hang loose.
Go with the tide and I'ma take care of you.

Alright, we gon' be alright.
Alright, you're gon' be alright!

Hang loose.
Hang loose!
Hang loose.
Hang loose.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
