Joe
What am I to do?
I been all around this world
Looking for something like you
Oh, Joe
You know I always roam...
But I still ain't got what I want

Here...
I here, and I'm there
I get around, Joe
But I ain't going nowhere
Oh, Lord
Why do you choose to keep me so alone
When I still ain't got what I want?

No, I still ain't got what I want
No, I still ain't got what I want!
No, I still haven't got what I want
If I ain't got you...

Now
They wanna put me on an airplane...
Tell me I'm flying off to someplace
That I ain't never been
See, Joe
Well, see, he always kept me going
But I still ain't got what I want...

Now Joe
God's given me so many things
He's fulfilled my many wishes
And I have achieved my many dreams
But oh, see Joe
See he's the only thing I want!
But I ain't gonna get what I want!

No, I still ain't got what I want
No, I still ain't got what I want!
Oh no, I still ain't got what I want
If I ain't got you...---
