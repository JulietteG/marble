I can't tell you how I feel, but I do 
Those things they say can't get to me, but they do 
I don't see the sky as blue, as you do 
Should I fantasize? There must be some way to love again 

It's been so hard for a girl like me, it's true 
People say I look just like my daddy, cause I do 

All I really want is peace of mind 

Why is everything so complicated? 
Why is everyone so infatuated? 
I gather myself safely 
To a life ...

Everybody's leaving all the time 
All I really want is peace of mind---
