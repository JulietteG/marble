All the world can't hold a candle to you 
Cause' all the world is in the dark 
I'll tell you why I'm so sure 
Ooh! I took a shine to you 
Oh Yea! 
And all them ladies can't change your mind 
And all them girls won't turn your head 
And all them lions in the jungle at night 
I don't worry 'bout my baby 

Cause I know why I don't worry 
I sing me no sad songs 
Happy! Never sad for long 
"Don't you call me anything doll, but your baby 
I know..." 

All them girls might wanna rip us apart 
If they wanna fight, they done fucked with the wrong heart 
They got another thing comin' 
Or I'll be a dead woman 

Oh, and I would do all that for you 
I'd do it for you 

Cause all them girls don't know you like I do 
All them girls don't know you like I do 
All them ladies don't know you like I do 
That's why I call you my baby 

So be mine 
So be my baby 
Just say alright 
Forever and alright---
