So much is going on
But she always comes around
Why don't you sit with me just a little while
Tell me what's wrong

If you just gimme all your love
Gimme all you got, babe
Gimme all your love

So tell me what you wanna do
Say we're done keeping you
Why don't you talk to me for just a little while
I am gonna try to make it right

Gimme all your love---
