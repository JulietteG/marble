A new world hangs outside the window
Beautiful and strange
It must be falling away
I must be
Sound and color with me for my mind
And it should show you where to go when I need to speak

Sound and color
With me in my mind
Sound and color
Try to keep yourself awake
Sound and color
This life ain't like a book
Sound and color
I wanna touch a human being
Sound and color
I want to go back to sleep
Sound and color
Ain't life just awfully strange
Sound and color
You wish you never gave it all away
Sound and color
The more the feeling ...
Sound and color
Life is
Sound and color
Love is
Sound and color
Love is
Sound and color
Sound and color
Sound and color---
