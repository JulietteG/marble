This night, this night, just like the rest

These same thoughts running through my 

head Same reckless phrase with a different 

face They say, they say that i am worthless 

But I'm not listening I swear, and yet 

Round, round, they spin like a record now 

Same false hopes built to be broke down 

Round and around I'm falling down Again 

Sticks and stones may break my bones Your 

words, they surely kill They surely kill 

This feels the same Complications and 

different situations I am holding out for 

love Is it worth it To die a little each 

day All for unseen grace? Sticks and 

stones may break my bones Your words, they 

surely kill They surely kill Your words are 

breaking down now I would say Where I've 

been to where I am It is worth it His grace 

When all else fades You can see it His face 

So now Round, round, they spin like a 

record now Same false hopes built to be 

broke These thoughts were meant to be 

broke down These thoughts were meant to be 

broke down These thoughts were meant to be 

broke down These thoughts were meant to be 

broke down They die a little each day Die 

a little each day Die a little each day Die 

a little each day Each day These thoughts 

were meant to be broke down These thoughts 

were meant to be broke These thoughts were 

meant to be broke down They're meant to be 

broke Sticks and stones may break my bones 

Your words, they surely kill They surely 

kill Your words, they surely kill They 

surely kill Your words are breaking down 

now It's all for her Again Yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Lora.
