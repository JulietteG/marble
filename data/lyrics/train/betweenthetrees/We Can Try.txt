What would you say if I,
Told you that all I thought about,
Is you since youve been gone. 

I wish someway somehow,
I could turn this world right back around,
and the mistakes Ive made. 

So that I could say to you that:
I know things arent quite what like what they used to be.
Different faces, different places
Yea, We can try,
Oh yea, we can try. 

What would you say if I,
Told you that Im not giving up,
However long it takes. 

Its clear that things have changed,
Since when we started but we cant
Just walk away babe. 

So Im telling you that:

I know, things arent quite like what they used to be.
Different faces, different places,
Yea, we can try,
Oh yea, we can try.
