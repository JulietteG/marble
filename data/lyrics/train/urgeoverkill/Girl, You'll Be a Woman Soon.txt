Girl, you'll be a woman... soon

I love you so much, can't count all the ways
I've died for you girl and all they can say is
"he's not your kind"
they never get tired of putting me down
and I'll never know when I come around
what I'm gonna find
don't let them make up your mind.
don't you know...

Girl, you'll be a woman soon,
please, come take my hand
girl, you'll be a woman soon,
soon, you'll need a man

I've been misunderstood for all of my life
but what they're saying girl it cuts like a knife
"the boy's no good"
well I've finally found what I'm a looking for
but if they get their chance they'll end it for sure
surely would
baby I've done all I could
now it's up to you...

Girl, you'll be a woman soon,
please, come take my hand
girl, you'll be a woman soon,
soon, you'll need a man

Girl, you'll be a woman soon,
please, come take my hand
girl, you'll be a woman soon,
soon but soon, you'll need a man---Lyrics submitted by nicole.
