You know I never, I never seen you look so good,
You never act the way you should. But I like it...
And I know you like it too, the way that I want you.
I gotta have you, oh yes I do!
I never, I never ever stay out late, 
You know that I can hardly wait, just to see you!
And I know you cannot wait, ah wait to see me too.
I gotta touch you

Chorus:
 Cuz baby we'll be
At the Drive Inn
In the Old Man's Ford
Behind them bushes
Until I'm screaming for more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door, and baby, 
Talk Dirty to me

You know I call you, I call you on the telephone
I'm only hoping that you're home, so I can hear you
When you say those words to me, and whisper so softly
I gotta hear you

Chorus

(CC pick that guitar and uh talk to me!)

Cuz baby we'll be
At the Drive Inn 
In the Old Man's Ford
Behind them Bushes
Till I'm screamin for more, more, more!
Down the basement
And lock the cellar door
And baby talk dirty to me, yeah
And baby talk dirty to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And baby uh, (whisper) talk dirty to me
Uh
