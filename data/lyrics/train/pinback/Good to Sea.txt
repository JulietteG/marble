they're moving earth outside
the ground is shaking like no beat
a dense terrible sound
at once both teeming and asleep
it seems to me to be a sign
i don't believe in such and yet
it seems to me to keep one eye on the situation's best

Its good to see you, 
its good to see you go.
Its good to see you, 
its good to see you go.

Its really not that kind
To terrorize one in one's sleep
And if you really tried, youd probably cut the chase too deep.
It seems to me that that's a fine way to keep you off your feet.
It seems to be no other side for the two ideas to meet.

Its good to see you, 
its good to see you go.
Its good to see you, Got to keep your mind on somewhere else.
its good to see you go. Got to keep on thinking of your health

Its good to see you, Strange when your mind burns...
its good to see you go. Strange when your mind burns...

Oh no, I hit rock bottom.
Oh no, I hit rock bottom.

Its good to see you,
Its good to see you, Got to keep your mind on somewhere else.
its good to see you. Got to keep on thinking of your health


its good to see you, Strange when your mind burns...
its good to see you, Strange when your mind burns...
its good to see you, Strange when your mind burns...
it's good to see you, Strange when your mind burns...---Lyrics submitted by erica.
