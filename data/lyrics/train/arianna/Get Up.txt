Some day Ill let you in 
Treat you right
Drive you out of your mind 
You never met a chick like me
Burn so bright
Im goanna make you blind

Always wonderin 
what you can have
Is it so bad 
If you dont get what you wanted 
Make it feel good 
As I whip you into shape 
Yeah, boy lets get it started 

*Chorus*
Give it up 
You cant win
Cause I know 
Where you been 
Such a shame 
You dont put up a fight
Thats a game 
That we play
At the end of the night
Its the same old story 
But you never get it right 
Give it up 

Yeah 
Come a little closer 
Come a little closer baby, baby

So stop crying 
Dont walk away 
No you wont 
Ever leave me behind (Nooo)
You better believe that Im hear to stay (Thats right)
Cause youre the shades 
And Im the sunshine (ohhhh)

Look at me boy 
Cause I got you 
Where I want you 
Isnt it so exciting
Wanna shake you 
Wanna break you 
Take the back seat boy 
Cause now Im driving 

*Chorus*
Give it up 
You cant win
Cause I know 
Where you been 
Such a shame 
You dont put up a fight
Thats a game 
That we play
At the end of the night
Its the same old story 
But you never get it right 
Give it up

Yeah 
Come a little closer 
Come a little closer baby, baby x3
If you are my baby 
And I make you crazy tonight

Look at me boy 
Cause I got you 
Where I want you 
Isnt it so exciting
Wanna shake you 
Wanna break you 
Take the back seat boy 
Cause now Im driving 

*Chorus*
Give it up 
You cant win
Cause I know 
Where you been 
Such a shame 
You dont put up a fight
Thats a game 
That we play
At the end of the night
Its the same old story 
But you never get it right 
Give it up---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
