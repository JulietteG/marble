[Girl] 
Hi Papi
[Omarion] 
Yea
So what you trying to do?
Oh forreal?
Let me hit you right back then.

[Verse 1]
Now this girl at work she's on me really bad ya'll
And the looks she gives my girl she be mad ya'll
She has no shame in her game
She lets it be known that she wants me, she wants me
She gently touched my arm as she walks by
The girl is dope and I cannot lie
But it's not worth the pain or the shame
And it's sure not worth losing my baby

[Chorus]
She's begging me come over, over
I'm tempted to drive over, over
If I do it's over, over
I got a girl at home
Temptations calling me
She's txting me come over, over
I'm tempted to walk over, over
But if I do it's over, over
I got a girl at home
Temptations calling me
Temptations (6x)
Her body kepps calling me (2x)

[Verse 2]
Now my momma used to warn me about these types of girls
How they break up happy homes and they do it well
And their style is to kiss and never tell
What goes around comes around
She whispers in my ear, oh no, oh no (3x)
She's telling me to come, come over 

[Chorus]
She's begging me come over, over
I'm tempted to drive over, over
If I do it's over, over
I got a girl at home
Temptations calling me
She's txting me come over, over
I'm tempted to walk over, over
But if I do it's over, over
I got a girl at home
Temptations calling me
Temptations (6x)
Her body kepps calling me (2x)

[Omarion]
Got my baby waiting at home so I can tap (laughs)
Aight I'm coming home to you baby
You know I love you, even though she bad
Even though I heard it's good, I'm all good
Yea---Lyrics submitted by amari.
