Chorus
(Yeah yeah yeah)
What you doin to me?
(Yeah yeah yeah)
What you want from me?
(Yeah yeah yeah)
What you doin to me?
What you want from me?
You're just f@#king killing me!

Everyday people
Attempt to find the ultimate sign
As the kids come down from the road of the block
I get chills when I hear them cry
As I picked him up I cleared his eyes
If it ain't worth the try?
In these dying times it's hard to change
You're calling in my ear and I hear.

(Yeah yeah yeah)
Now we're falling to the ground
(Yeah yeah yeah)
So get your hands up!

Chorus
(Yeah yeah yeah)
What you doin to me?
(Yeah yeah yeah)
What you want from me?
(Yeah yeah yeah)
What you doin to me?
What you want from me?
You're just f@#king killing me!

Oh no officer, please no don't draw your guns
I'm on the run it's a state of mind
See these banking corporates fake and whine
They make you live the life they define
Do you even know what's going on?
I don't mean to sound miserable
It's written all along and I hear

(Yeah yeah yeah)
Now we're falling to the ground
(Yeah yeah yeah)
So get your hands up!

Chorus

(guitar break)

This time around we shall march to battle
And bring victory to the people
Isn't that what you want?
Isn't that what we've wanted all along?
Watch the outcome
I'll give you the outcome!

(Yeah yeah yeah)
Now we're burning to the ground
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Is this the end?
(Yeah yeah yeah)
I guess we'll never wake up
(Yeah yeah yeah)
So get your hands up!
