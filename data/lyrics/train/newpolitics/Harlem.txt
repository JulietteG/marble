I spend my money on the regular miracles
Just like you, like me, like everybody else
Up on the Sun looking sad and beautiful
Just like you, like me, like everybody else

When it gets loud, I turn it up
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
When it's too hot, I light it up
Light it up yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em

Here come the jets, hide my money in your tubesocks
Run like me, like hell, like everybody else
Hair Metal on a Japanese Boombox
Kicks like you, like me, like everybody else

When it gets loud, I turn it up
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
When it's too hot, I light it up
Light it up yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em
When it gets soft, I shake it up
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
You're so sweet, but I like it rough
Light it up yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em

Make a movie on the couch with a flip phone
Just like you, like I, like fingers in your mouth
Up on the Sun, playing drums with a bleached bone
Just like you, like me, like everybody else

When it gets loud, I turn it up
Shake it like a bad girl up in Harlem
When it's too hot, I light it up
Light it up yeah, smoke 'em if you got 'em---Lyrics submitted by Toni Swartz.
