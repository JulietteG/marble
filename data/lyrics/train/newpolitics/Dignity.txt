You walk the streets, never feel no guilt.
You make your money, sellin' guns on the playground.
I'm so ashamed, 'cause we all the same.
"Killin' in the name-", money is the game now.
And you're buyin' bombs, and we pay the price.
Eat your lies and we'll feed it to the children.
Is this what you want? Is this what you need?
You're gonna kill us all to bring peace!

[chorus]
My blood, my soul; is my enemy-
My love, my life; is poison to me-
I know it's not how its supposed to be.
Got no choice, no voice-
I have no dignity.

You manipulate with your bag of tricks,
You're playing God with the world on my shoulder
Can't regulate, 'cause the world's at stake,
We so lost and we all feel that its over.
But I'm one to blame, for this burn in pain
It's eatin' up the world and we don't live in the shame
Its hard to maintain when its so insane; so- so insane
So kids; don't listen to your parents, your parents can't teach ya
All they ever left was the world in a mess

[chorus]
My blood, my soul; is my enemy.
My love, my life; is poison to me.
I know it's not how its supposed to be.
Got no choice, no voice-
I have no dignity.


Com'on... yeah...
We got no control of the state of our minds...
Now I see that all I've ever lived was a lie...
We all took to believe that there was no way around-
There's no way around- there's no way around? There's no way around!

My blood, my soul is my enemy.
My love, my life is poison to me.
I know it's not how its supposed to be.
Got no choice, no voice-
I have no dignity.

[chorus]
My blood, my soul; is my enemy.
My love, my life; is poison to me.
I know it's not how its supposed to be.
Got no choice, no voice-
I have no dignity, yeah...... dignity, yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
