oh, oh, oh it's magic, you know!! 
never believe it's not sooo!!
never been awake, never seen a day break,
crawlin' under my pillow in the mornin'
there's music in my head!  
this crazy music playin in the mornin'its not so
 its magic you know never belive its not soooooooo

wow!

another sunny day
a dream of far away
dreaming on my pillow in the morning
never been awake never seen a day break leanin on my pillow in the morning light
oh oh oh its magic u know never belive its not so
its magic u know never belive its not so
oh oh oh its magic u know 
never belive its not so
 its magic u know never belive its not so
oh oh oh its magic u know never belive its not so
its magic u know never belive its not so
oh oh oh its magic u know 
never belive its not so
 its magic u know never belive its not so

never believe---Lyrics submitted by Bethanee.
