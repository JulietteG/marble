I'm falling fast...
I can't stop myself,
There's no one else.

I'm falling...
I'm falling...
There it is,
I said it.

And every word is true.
I'm scared but I don't regret it, no.
All I want is you.
What am I supposed to do?

I'm falling...
I'm falling fast...
I can't stop myself,
there's no one else.

I'm falling...
I'm falling...
I don't want to be the first to say it.
I don't want to be the last to know.

You were there,
You were just afraid of letting go, letting go.
If this is real, I don't want to fake it.
I don't wanna hide anymore.
We don't have to be afraid of letting go.

I need to know..
You're falling...
I can't stop myself,
There's no one else.

I'm falling...
I'm falling...
I don't want to be the first to say it.
I don't want to be the last to know.

You were there,
You were just afraid of letting go, letting go.
If this is real, I don't want to fake it.
I don't wanna hide anymore.

We don't have to be afraid of letting go.
Just let go...
Just let go...---Lyrics submitted by Kimvy.
