It was just another night
But then you walked into the corner of my eye
And I just wanna run to you
And now you spin my world around

You took my words away
And you turn 'em upside down
And I just wanna fall for you 
And I just wanna fall for you

Why you gotta take me for a ride with your eyes? 
Yeah, you know you make me ache inside every time
Yeah I cant have you, so before I go ,before I walk away
I just wanna know
Why you gotta be so beautiful?
So beautiful 

I didn't wanna pass you by
I need to turn around 
But I'm too afraid to try
When I look back at you
I don't know, I don't know
What to do

Why you gotta take me for a ride with your eyes?
Yeah you know you make me ache inside every time
Yeah I cant have you so before I go, before I walk away
I just wanna know 
Why you gotta be so beautiful

Yeah 
So beautiful 
Mmm

Why you gotta take me for a ride with your eyes?
Yeah you know you make me ache inside every time
Yeah I cant have you so before I go, before I walk away
I just wanna know 
Why you gotta be so beautiful

Yeah so beautiful oh
Before I go before I walk away
I just wanna know
Why you gotta be so beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Tori.
