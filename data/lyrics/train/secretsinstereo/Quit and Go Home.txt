(Hey, hey, hey)
I think you've got problems,
(Oh, oh, oh)
More than you know,
(Hey, hey, hey)
Do you want to solve them?
(No, no, no)
You just quit and go home.

Nothin' is right, 
So everything's wrong,
So you close your eyes and start singing.

You don't know the words,
But it's your favourite song,
How 'bout one more time with some feelin'?

[Chorus]

You're breaking your heart,
You're making it bleed,
Who can say no to the victim?

You're rockin' the part,
You were made for T.V.,
How 'bout one more show for the children?

[Chorus]
(You just quit and go home) x2

[Chorus] x2---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
