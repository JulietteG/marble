Can't make myself at home,
Can't get comfortable here,
Everything is wrong, everything is wrong, and I can't make it right.

I stumble through the darkness,
Can't help but feel helpless,
All I want to do, all I want to do is-

Close my eyes and dream of you,
But every single time I do,

I wake up with a headache and a heart break,
And a life I don't know how to live,
I can't go back, I know that,
But I miss you

And the world that we were living in,

But that was then, 
And this is now,
And I've gotta find a way to get by somehow

On the wrong side, 
On the wrong side of yesterday.

I'm going through the motions,
But it won't feel like my life,
I don't know who I am, don't know who I am,
Without you,

I try to play the part,
'Cause I've seen the movies,
At least a hundred times, but never through the eyes of-

the desperate soul I've turned into,
I press rewind and I run to you,

[Chorus] x2---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
