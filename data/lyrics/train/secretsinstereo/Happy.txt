I wanna be
Next to you
Watch you while you sleep

Holding you
Lost inside
Every breath you breathe

I don't wanna live a day without you
I just wanna be the one that makes you happy
Happy
I don't wanna live a day without you
I just wanna be the one that makes you happy
Happy

One minute more
A thousand years
It's all the same to me

Cos' I'm incomplete
And I need you more
With every breath I breathe

I don't wanna live a day without you
I just wanna be the one that makes you happy
Happy
I don't wanna live a day without you
I just wanna be the one that makes you happy
Happy

Makes you happy

When I try to let you know
My words get tangled up
And everytime I find that I'm, outside lookin' in
I can't let this moment go
When you're the only one
That makes me feel the way I feel inside

Lately I'm fallin' for you
Lately I'm fallin' for you

I don't wanna live a day without you
I just wanna be the one that makes you happy
Happy
Happy
I don't wanna live a day without you
I just wanna be the one that makes you happy
Happy
Happy

I just want to make you happy
I just want to make you happy
Happy
I just want to make you happy

I just want to make you happy---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
