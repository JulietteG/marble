All the cities in the world
And so very little time and
So many different girls
All you have to do is find them
There's a wealth of opportunity
You make your plans accordingly
A pity, but the pretty ones are usually more touristy
Say, how'd you like to run away from these machines?
Everywhere the spies are printing out our dreams
Seven stops in seven different countries
Seven page itineraries memories thick as bloody marys, Jesus, Jospeh, bloody hell

Right now were here in Boston
In love with downtown crossing
New York will still be there in the morning
Come back to bed, my darling

I had Julian and Steve
You had Julia and Jeanette
You wear your terror on your sleeve
For all the men I haven't met yet
I had Oliver in Potsdam, you had Elanor in Amsterdam
We're keeping score so carefully
We've lost the state we're in completely
Honestly, your foot is out the door and I've got scores 
Of offers elsewhere and keep both feet planted firmly in the air
And tomorrow you can totally erase me from your mind 
No really, everything is fine
Because right now we're here in Boston
In my apartment in the south end
Forget your friends in London
Come back to bed my darling

You can put the details in a letter
The more embarrassing the better
Right now I can be happy if I choose to
I know that in the morning I will lose you

And maybe you'll be mad
And maybe I'll be gray
Before we really understand
Or maybe it won't matter anyway
We'll find out that your mom was right
And you'll admit you're really gay
And maybe we'll wake up
In a city far away
Or maybe we'll make up
And buy a house and have a dozen kids who'll run away 
It doesn't matter anyway
Right now we're here in boston
NIMBFRTO Feeling
Don't worry who these jokes will all be lost on
Come back to bed my darling
There is nothing in the world that we can count on
Even that we will wake up is an assumption
But I know for a fact that I loved someone
And for about a year he lived in Boston
In Boston---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
