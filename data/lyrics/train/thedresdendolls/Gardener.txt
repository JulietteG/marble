Sorry for the setback
I know I let you down
Turn back the clocks and step back
And spring might come around

My little misbegotten
You're quite a stubborn bud
If we can't make you open
We will take it out in blood

We'll make a man out of you yet
We will plant brambles in your bed
Just close your eyes and count to ten
This is as good as it will get

Oh, is our little, little willow, willow weeping?
Flutter to your knees
The untilled things before me
Oh, the possibilities

Thank you for the warning
But I still see the sun
A little global warming
Never hurt no one

We'll make a man out of you yet
A crown of thorns around your head
Get off your knees and have a look
This is as good as it will get

At last, my little flower
Is getting put to use
You've always been a failure
But now you're bearing strange new fruit

The inside's are all useless
But the rest is fertile, so
I will take the belt from off the hook
And watch the garden grow

We'll make a man out of you yet
You won't know what will hit you next
The gardener's coming to collect
You wanted love?
That's what you get
The gardener's coming to collect
The gardener's coming to collect
The gardener's coming to collect
The gardener's coming to collect
The gardener's coming to collect---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
