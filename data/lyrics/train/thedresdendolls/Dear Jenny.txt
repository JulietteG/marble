Boys wear overcoats in heat like this to keep themselves from showing
Girls fill out prescriptions for the tricks that keep their hearts from growing
Specialists review the year in tears and call for drastic measures
Send them to resorts for boys and girls to get their wits together

Sad but true the facts of life are bound to get you down
So what's the use dear Jenny?
Anyway the world is pretty, world is pretty

Ashley talks to astronauts back home by means of fax transmission
And Andy gets a new tattoo each time he gets that bathroom privilege
Weary o so drealiy we wave our flags into the camera
Amber goes the hotlines are all friends but no-one ever answers

Sad but true the truth can turn your smile to a frown
So what's the use, dear Jenny?
Anyway the world is pretty, world is pretty, world is pretty
Upside-down

The rates are better in the summer
The rates are better in the summer
Looks like old Jenny's doing better
The rates are better in the summer

Back at home the broadcast warning bounces off of an empty table
Jenny asks the astronauts to sleep with her behind the stable
Christmas hasn't been the same since dad put in the central heating
Checks you before bedtime with a battery to keep your new heart beating

And the world might turn a million times around before
They tell you, Jenny, anyway the world is happy, world is happy, world is happy, world is happy

Sometimes they let strangers in and other times they check their records
When they check out in the morning dad puts out the lie detectors
Jenny prays to gods she've never heard of for a special warning
All the walls stay dead as Jenny's head is
But she's still observing

Sad but true the two of us might really make it through
But what's the use dear Jenny anyway?
The world is happy
World is happy
World is happy without you

The rates are better in the summer
The rates are better in the summer
Looks like old Jenny's doing better
The rates are better in the summer---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
