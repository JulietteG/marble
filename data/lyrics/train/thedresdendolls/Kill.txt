I am an anarchist
An antichrist
An asterisk
I am an anorak
An acolyte
An accidental
I am eleven feet
Okay, eight
Six foot three
I fought the British and I won
I have a rocket ship
A jetfighter
A paper airplane

So say what you will
I am the kill
The only thing that keeps you
Really truly safe from being real

I have a tendency
To exaggerate
Just a little bit
I am a plagiarist
Apologist
A walrus, cokehead, lizard
I am an optimist
A closeted misogynist
I fought the British and I won
I have a wishing well 
A living will 
A magical eight ball

So say what you will
I am the kill
The only thing that keeps you 
Really truly safe from being real

Put Pat Sajak back in office
Put Pat Sajak back

But the sun still sets on you
And the retarded party nobody came to but you
And so you drink to all the emptiness until you wake up
And there's hell to pay again

And the punch lines point at you
And all the comebacks in the world are in your head
And you can't say them until everybody leaves
And it's just you and your imaginary friends
Your imaginary friends
Your imaginary friends---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
