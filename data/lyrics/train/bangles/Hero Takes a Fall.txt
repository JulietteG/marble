The hero is exposed when
His crimes are brought to the light of day
Won't be feeling sorry, sorry, sorry
On the judgement day

Wasn't it me who said
There'll be a price to pay

And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall
(Hero takes a fall) oh no

Your mother told you stories
You substitute with girls who tell you more
Suddenly your sycophants 
Are chanting slogans at your door

We're seeing through you now
I saw it all before

And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall
(Hero takes a fall) oh no

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

Emotion is a virtue
For you it is the one fatal flaw
Sitting on your throne and drinking
Thinking she'll return your call

Every story's got an ending
Look out, here it comes, here it comes

And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall
(Hero takes a fall) oh no

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh---Lyrics submitted by stephen.
