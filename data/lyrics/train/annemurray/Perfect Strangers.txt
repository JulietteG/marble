perfect strangers 
both of us know the danger
sharing secrets in each others arms
time is passing
one chance is all we`re asking
somehow, somewhere love will find a way
gently, slowly let me fall in love with you

far across the ocean in the darkest night
i was sailing on the ship of fools
but looking in your eyes i see the harbor lights
now i just want to stay with you

so take my hand far away
understand what i need
and love me as if you`ve always love me
till the morning light
its alright
you`re the perfect stranger tonight

my love for you
feels my heart the more you hold me gently
in your loving arms
hope and 
i love the love we`ve started
sharing freely in this place and time
once in a lifetime we find love
let it be tonight

far across the ocean in the darkest night
i was sailing on the ship of fools
but looking in your eyes i see the harbor lights
now i just want to stay with you

so take my hand far away
understand what i need
and love me as if you`ve always loved me
till the morning light
its alright
you`re the perfect stranger tonight---Lyrics submitted by gieriz.
