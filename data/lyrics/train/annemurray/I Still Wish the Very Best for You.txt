Well you know I'm really bad at writing letters
You know I'm not much better with the phone
Day after day goes by and I still think of you'
Cause I still wish the very best for you

Well I've been hearing that you've got a baby
And that you're happy with somebody new
You an I both know sometimes
These things don't work out right
I want you to know
That I still wish the very best for you

So don't you think because we're not together
That I won't wish the very best for you
Even though your love shines on some other
Baby I want you to know
That I still wish the very best for you

So love and be loved by another
You don't have to feel we're going to lose
You are free to roam and rediscover
Someone who will share your ways with you---Lyrics submitted by lun chongloi.
