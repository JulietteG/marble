The hand that rocks the cradely mirrors
I'll go all the way, I'll go all the way to give you wings
You've got the glow of two persons
You ride a wave, you ride a wave that gives us wings

No man est o man (hand in hand)
There is no other way
See the lions live it up

Humouring forth our endavour
You ride the wave, you ride the wave that gives us wings

We're in each others dreams more than ever
We ride the wave, we ride the wave that gives us wings

No man est o man
There is no other way
See the lions live it up
No man est o men
There's wildness in our heart
See the lions live it up
See the lions live it up

Let's go home and be convena
Let's go home
Lets be convena

No man es to man
There's no other way
There's wildness in our heart
See the lions live it up
See the lions live it up

Oh no
Oh no---Lyrics submitted by Vicky van der Linden.
