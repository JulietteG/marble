Life
It's a touch
Everything is golden
Open
Wider
Stumble
Patch
Yeah
Right
Well
Yeah
You talk too fast
The house you want is
Right
December
Monday morning
Okay
What you got?
Shiver and smile
(Stare, stare like a bear, then you'll know me anywhere)
Still though tiny stars
Your shoes appear
(Stare, stare like a bear, call your mother Ginger Hair)
Sharp shadow
Clean dirt
Metropoles
Statuesque
(Stare, stare like a bear, then you'll know me anywhere)
Gas crown
In a blue sky
Asbestos rooms
(Stare, stare like a bear, call your mother Ginger Hair)
Corrugated rhythms

Weird blue
(Blah blah, blah blah blah...)
Weird blue
(Blah blah, blah blah blah...)

Spangled top
Leather jacket
Run your fingers through your hair
We're nearly there
Hiding in the dark
(Stare, stare like a bear, then you'll know me anywhere)
Sheltered from the winds
Hold hands
(Stare, stare like a bear, call your mother Ginger Hair)
And we go away
The crafty one
Towers

A light
A globe over the horizon
A light
A globe over the horizon

(Stare, stare like a bear, then you'll know me anywhere)
(Stare, stare like a bear, call your mother Ginger Hair)
(Blah blah, blah blah blah...)
A lights and globe over the horizon
(Stare, stare like a bear, call your mother Ginger Hair)
(Blah blah, blah blah blah...)
A lights and globe over the horizon
(Stare, stare like a bear, then you'll know me anywhere)
(Blah blah, blah blah blah...)
A lights and globe over the horizon
(Stare, stare like a bear, call your mother Ginger Hair)
(Blah blah, blah blah blah...)---
