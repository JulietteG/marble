And baby, maybe you've been saved
And you just don't know it
Maybe, maybe you've been hurt
And you're scared to show it

But sometimes, does your pain become too much for you to bear?
And sometimes, do you run away?

And I said maybe, maybe you won't stay
And it doesn't matter
Cause lately, lately I have changed
And I feel much better

But sometimes, does your pain become too much for you to bear?
And sometimes, do you run away?

You're gonna take this broken heart that he gave you
And follow the light of the stars you love
When every day is all the same
You made me wonder why 

Did you try, if you knew better?
I wished on a star, and it landed on you
I lie, because I'm not better
And I'm not happy for you, I'm not happy for you

And I said baby, is there something you need to say?
Cause your heart says nothing
And maybe, maybe I'm to blame
And this has all been over

But sometimes, does your pain become too much for you to bear?
And sometimes, do you run away?

You're gonna take this broken heart that he gave you
And follow the light of the stars you love
When every day is all the same
You made me wonder why 

Did you try, if you knew better?
I wished on a star, and it landed on you
I lie, because I'm not better
And I'm not happy for you, I'm not happy for you
And I'm not happy for you, I'm not happy for you
Yeah, I'm not happy for you, I'm not happy for you

And I said maybe, something you need to say?
Cause your heart says nothing
And baby, but I don't think that we'll change

Why did we try if you knew better?
I wished on a star, and it landed on you
I lie, because I'm not better
And I'm not happy for you, I'm not happy for you

Did you try, if you knew better?
I wished on a star, and it landed on you
I lie, because I'm not better
And I'm not happy for you, I'm not happy for you
And I'm not happy for you, I'm not happy for you
Yeah, I'm not happy for you, I'm not---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
