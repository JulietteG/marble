She said I wonder when it'll be my day
'Cause I'm not too far from breaking down
All I've got are screams inside
But somehow they come out in a smile
And I'm wondering if I'll always feel this way, this way

[Chorus]
Tell me about those nights you stayed awake
Tell me about those days you hated me
Tell me how you'd rather die alone
Than being stuck here with me
And maybe you've fallen down
And maybe you just took the long way home
But baby you could never love you like me
And one day this will fade away
In the mirror you'll see a smiling face
And standing next to you will always be me, yeah me

One day you're gonna see things my way
You gave me so much room that I can't breathe
When all I've got are pictures to view
It was nothing before and I started with you
For some reason it's supposed to be that way, that way

[Chorus]
Tell me about those nights you stayed awake
Tell me about those days you hated me
Tell me how you'd rather die alone
Than being stuck here with me
And maybe you've fallen down
And maybe you just took the long way home
But baby you could never love you like me
And one day this will fade away
In the mirror you'll see a smiling face
And standing next to you will always be me, yeah me

[Bridge]
If I could shrink it down and put it in your hands
We made it hurt so much, I can't forget the past
Just tell me what to say, show me what to do
Then I could forgive me and I would forgive you

[Chorus]
And maybe you've fallen down
And maybe you just took the long road home
But baby you will never love you like me
And one day this will fade away
In the mirror you'll see a smiling face
And standing next to you will always be me
You know will always be me, and I will wait
Always be me, til I see your smiling...---Lyrics submitted by ALAN AND  RACHEL.
