I hear the drizzle of the rain,
Like a memory it falls,
Soft and warm continuing,
Tapping on my roof and walls.

From the shelter of my mind,
Through the window of my eyes,
I gaze beyond the rain drenched streets,
To England where my heart lies.

My minds distracted and diffused,
My thoughts are many miles away,
They lie with you when youre asleep,
Kiss you when you start your day.

And the song I was writing is left undone,
I dont know why I spend my time,
Writing songs I cant believe,
With words that tear and strain to rhyme.

And so you see I have come to doubt,
All that I once held as truth,
I stand alone without beliefs,
The only truth I know is you.

And as I watch the wary drops of rain,
Weave their weary paths and die,
I know that I am like the rain, 
There but for the grace of you go i.---Lyrics submitted by N.
