I am just a poor boy tho my stories seldom told,
I have squandered my resistance, for a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies in jest , still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest
Hmmm mmm mmm ......hmmm mmm mmm  hmmm

When I left my home and my family I was no more then a boy in the company of strangers, 
in the quiet of the railway station runnin scared...
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
looking for the places only they would know

Chorus
lye la lye,... lye la lye lye la lye la lye
lye la lye lye lye lye la la la lye

Asking only workmen wages I come looking for a job but I get no offers
just a come on from the whores on 7th avenue
I do declare the were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there
la la la la la la la

Chorus

And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone, going home.....
where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me....
bleeding me ee
goin home

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade and he carries the reminders
of every glove that laid him down or cut him, till he cried out...in his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving
but the fighter still remains hmmm hmmm mmm mmm
