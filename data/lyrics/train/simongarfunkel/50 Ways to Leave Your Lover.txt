the problem is all inside your head, she said to me
the answer is easy if you take it logically.
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
there must be 50 ways to leave your lover.

she said it's really not my habit to intrude
furtermore i hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
but i'll repeat my self, at the risk of being crude
there must be 50 ways to leave your lover

chorus:
just slip out the back, Jack
make a new plan, Stan
don't need to be coy, Roy
just get yourself free
hop on the bus, Gus
don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key, Lee
and get yourself free.

she said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
i wish there was something i could do to make you smile again
i said, i appreciate that,
and would you please explain about the 50 ways.

she said, why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
and i believe that in the morning you'll begin to see the light
and then she kissed me and i realized she probably was right
there must be 50 ways to leave your lover
50 ways to leave your lover...
