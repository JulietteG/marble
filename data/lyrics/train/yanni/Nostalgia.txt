All of these God-damned insecurities
And this blood-curling anxiety
Oh I'll strike you a deal if you'll keep 'em for me
The most unbelievable bargain you've ever seen
But it's sad or we are bitter from neglect
Oh nostalgia
When the world moves and we with it
Oh nostalgia
I've been on the urban floor,
Different oceans, distant shores
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, woh oh oh
Oh nostalgia
So this heart-startling inpropriaty
And this gut-emptying anxiety
Yeah I'll strike you a deal if you'll keep 'em for me
The most unbelievable bargain you've ever seen
So let me analyse the cause
How do I overlook the flaws?
What's buried in golden mane
That leads directly to the vein
What sings to me so low and soft?
I need to know if you are all,
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
nostalgia, oh nostalgia, oh nostalgia
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, woh oh oh.
Oh nostalgia---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
