The Keeper Performed by Leslie Mills

Ive been like a bird without song for a while
Dry like a lake without rain for a while
You suddenly stepped in my life
And made me cry like an angel
Ooh, youre something else
Like a smile without end

Come into my life
Go a little deeper
Come into my life
You could be the keeper

Youre pulling me closer and youre flowin in
With every emotion that rushes in
Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

Ive been like a home without people for a while
Empty like a poem without words for a while
You suddenly stepped in my life
And made me shine like a diamond
Ooh, youre something else
Like a dream without end

Come into my life, go a little deeper
Come into my life, you could be the keeper
All I have
Youre pulling me closer and youre flowing in
All I have
With every emotion that rushes in
Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

Ooh youre something else
Like a dream without end

Come into my life, go a little deeper
Come into my life, you could be the keeper

All I have
Youre pulling me closer and youre flowing in
All I have
With every emotion that rushes in
Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper
All I have
All I have
Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper
Turn me on to your love
Light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper---Lyrics submitted by Jami.
