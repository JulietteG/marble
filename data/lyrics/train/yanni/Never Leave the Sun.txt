Never Leave the Sun Performed by Leslie Mills

Follow you out of a restless day
Walking a road where a dream can change
You caught me there where my mind was lost
Trying to make sense (trying to make sense)

Show me the world with an open heart
Looking inside everything you are
Hold me there where I learn to trust
Trying to make sense of us (trying to make sense)

You tell me that Im strong enough
I want to run away
I want to fly into your arms and never leave the sun
Oh I, I will never leave the sun

Somewhere between wanting to believe
And taking a chance that you promise me
Somewhere between every morning dawn
And giving in to love

You tell me that Im strong enough
I wanna run away
I want to fly into your arms and never leave the sun
Oh I, I will never leave the sun

Never gonna leave the sun
Tell me

You tell me that Im strong enough
Im never gonna leave the sun
I wanna fly into your arms
Im never gonna leave the sun

You tell me that Im strong enough
I wanna run away
I wanna fly into your arms and never leave the sun
Oh I, I will never leave the sun

You tell me that Im strong enough
Im never gonna leave the sun
Im never gonna leave the sun---Lyrics submitted by Jami.
