I close my eyes to see the world
I close my eyes so that it won't hurt
I'm sailing on blue ocean and flying to you

I catch my breathe under the full moon
A star that shines, so pleased to meet you
Maybe I'll dream forever
And I'd like to love right here

Before the night ends
And dawn of a new day dawns
How I hope, how I hope

That out of this endless blue
Somehow I will find you
Before the night ends
Before the night ends

I made a choice more than a few times
To walk a road that didn't end up so right

But I want to go the distance
I'd like to love right here

Before the night ends
And dawn of a new day dawns
How I hope, how I hope

That out of this endless blue
Somehow I will find you
Before the night ends
Before the night ends

Close my eyes
Never gonna let up

Before the night ends
I hope I find you---Lyrics submitted by srs.
