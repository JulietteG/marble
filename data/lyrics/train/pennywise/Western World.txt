We are the dregs of the western world
The steroid boys and video girls
We are the viral internet stars
And the anchor man cant stop crying
We are the dead with the dreaded disease
The nuclear sons of you and me
Lets go all right  all right lets go 
What the fuck are you saying? 

Now  I dont wanna live here anymore 
We are the best and well fight to the death 
Theres nothing left worth fighting for
In the western world 

This is the end of evolutions rise 
The feeding frenzy of the uncivilized
The paparazzi parasites
And the vultures cant stop feeding 
This is the face of our vanity
The tabloid death of humanity
Lets go all right - all right lets go
What the fuck are you saying 

Now  I dont wanna live here anymore
We take the best and we spit out the rest
And always leave em wanting more
In the western world

We are the dregs of the western world
The steroid boys and video girls
We are the viral internet stars
And the anchor man cant stop lying
We are the dead with the dreaded disease
The nuclear sons of you and me
Lets go all right  all right lets go
What the fuck are you saying? 

Now  I dont wanna live here anymore
We are the best and well fight to the death 
Theres nothing left worth fighting for
Now  I dont wanna live here anymore
We take the best and we spit out the rest
And always leave em wanting more
In the western world---Lyrics submitted by Big.
