oh I am just knot, on a string
that you drag the world around in
oh baby not, every thing, needs to burn
there's no need to fight- into the night
don't let that temper loose now
I'll move and grind into the night
all the skys will allow
don't you feel left out

Ill take a lot and the sink
let me do something true
oh baby not everything should begin

there's no need to fight into the night
don't let that temper loose now
I'll move and grind into the night
all the skys will allow
don't you feel left out
don't you feel left out
don't let that temper loose now
there's no need to fight into the night
all the skys will allow---Lyrics submitted by James Sweeney.
