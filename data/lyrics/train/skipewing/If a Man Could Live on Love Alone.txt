I've heard it said and I believe,
If a man has nothing else,
If a man has only love, 
He has all he needs.

Well, I've got love enough for two.
The only thing that I need now,
The only thing that I don't have is you.

But I can see it perfect in my mind all the time,
And that' s what keeps me holding on, 
Pretending you're still mine.
I wouldn't miss you half as much,
I could make it on my own,
If a man could live on love alone.

Sure I like my job.
Of course, I love my friends.
But what I'd really love is waking up one day 
To find we've always had what should have been

'Cause all the feeling's there.
God I miss your touch.
Is wanting you and needing you here with me
Really asking all that much?

But I can see it perfect in my mind all the time,
And that's what keeps me holding on,
Pretending you're still mine.
I wouldn't miss you half as much,
I could make it on my own,
If a man could live on love alone.

If a man could live on love alone.---Lyrics submitted by Jeanne.
