Tonight as I lay holding you, you whisper,
Three words I didn't want to hear you say,
'Cause I don't know how I'm ever going to answer,
But I'll tell you how I'm feeling anyway.

I don't have far to fall before I reach the bottom of my heart.
I already feel a fire burning in the deepest part.
I just can't say the words until I'm sure there's no doubt at all.
If I'm not in love, I don't have far to fall.

Please don't misunderstand the words I'm saying.
Hurting you's the last thing on my mind.
See, I just need to know that love is what we're making.
Sometimes love, it takes a little time.

But I don't have far to fall before I reach the bottom of my heart.
I already feel a fire burning in the deepest part.
I just can't say the words until I'm sure there's no doubt at all.
But if I'm not in love, I don't have far to fall.

If I'm not in love, I don't have far to fall.---Lyrics submitted by Jeanne.
