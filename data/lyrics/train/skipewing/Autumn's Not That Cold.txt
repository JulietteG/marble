Back here the leaves are turning
On me just like you
Change is full of color
And it's anything but blue
I thought that I'd stop living
Without you here to hold
But I'm just not that lonesome
And autumn's not that cold

That summer sun was setting
When you set your sights to leave
And I braced myself believing
It would bring me to my knees
Oh,but here it is October
Oh the leaves are turning gold
Each night a little bluer
But autumns not that cold

I know before too long
I'll feel the chill that winter brings
But by then I'll just be looking
Forward to another Spring

I'm almost feel guilty
That the hurts not taking hold
Guess I'm just not that lonesome
And autumns not that cold---Lyrics submitted by Dan Springer.
