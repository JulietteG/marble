Brave and proud at the last sun towards Erinor's mount,
the only way to reach there, where the air smells like death
mud, marsh... remains of a reign that have been frightening us for milleniums
the black demon screams its hate, he wants to revenge the latest war

Fire of freedom
An old flame
in their hearts awakes the ardour
againts the darkness
that was an ancient evil
primordial in its reality

AN AGE OF BLOOD, OF OBSCURE MEMORIES
REVIVES IN HARGOR FOR A NEW EVIL
ELECTED IN ELGARD GUARDIANS OF FATE
NOW THEY ARE AND THEY WILL BE THE TRUE HEROES

Only the eagles dare to fly there, beyond the peaks between West and North
Hargor reveals its unreality which discloses fear in their eyes
They have to leave for Mother Earth, they even know that they may die
the rock is strong but they are even more stronger... a dragon, a lion dwells in their soul and heart

Mounts with golden mantle
reveal the truth
walls and towers, immensity
Grey majesty
Black epic character
in you is hidden the ancient evil

AN AGE OF BLOOD, OF OBSCURE MEMORIES
REVIVES IN HARGOR FOR A NEW EVIL
ELECTED IN ELGARD GUARDIANS OF FATE
NOW THEY ARE AND THEY WILL BE THE TRUE HEROES---Lyrics submitted by Ichigo.
