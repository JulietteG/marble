I have traveled across
Through the fear and the loss
In a world that has slipped from the past
With all the joy and the pain
It's only pride that remains
That's the one thing that truly lasts
But like a sinking stone
There's a weight on my bones
And it's trying to lead me astray
So I look deep inside
I take it in stride
And know that I'll be OK

I'm coming home
I'm here to stay
I've got the wind at my back
And now I'm wide awake
In this moment
I am finally
Coming home

In this city whose soul
Had been taken control
Leaving everything painted black
But I'll start over again
And put every color in
Find that love and take it back

I'm coming home
I'm here to stay
I've got the wind at my back
And now I'm wide awake
In this moment
I am finally
Living for today
I'm coming home
And now I can see
Everything I ever was
Staring right back at me
In this moment
I am finally
Coming home

And now the darkness turns to light
This desperation it ends tonight
No longer alone
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

I'm coming home
I'm here to stay
I've got the wind at my back
And now I'm wide awake
In this moment
I am finally
Living for today
I'm coming home
And now I can see
Everything I ever was
Staring right back at me
In this moment
I am finally
Coming home---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
