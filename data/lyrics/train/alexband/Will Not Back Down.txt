I let you down
But I'll make it up to you somehow in time
You'll see it's true
If my will is strong
And I know that as these days go on
You'll find I'll get to you
 If it's the last thing i do

Every step you take
I'll be a second behind
Every move you make
I'll be the thorn in your side
And i know you can't fight this now
I will not back down
I'm the sky 
The stars
The moon 
The setting sun
I'm the feeling inside you
when you're coming undone
You know you can't fight this now
I will not back down

Some say I'm cruel
But nobody knows
What i feel for you
My love
You're the only one
Do you understand?
I can't let you slip right through my hands
No, my love
Don't try to run
See in my eyes
You and I
Are one

Every step you take
I'll be a second behind
Every move you make
I'll be the thorn in your side
And i know you can't fight this now
I will not back down
I'm the sky 
The stars
The moon 
The setting sun
I'm the feeling inside you
when you're coming undone
You know you can't fight this now
I will not back down

Will not back down
Every step you take
I'll be a second behind
Every move you make
I'll be the thorn in your side
And i know you can't fight this now

Every step you take
I'll be a second behind
Every move you make
I'll be the thorn in your side
And i know you can't fight this now
I will not back down
I'm the sky 
The stars
The moon 
The setting sun
I'm the feeling inside you
when you're coming undone
You know you can't fight this now
I will not back down
No
I will not back down
I will not back down---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
