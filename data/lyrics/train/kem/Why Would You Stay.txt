There's a light shining on you. 
And baby I'm trembling inside. 
Loved a woman that I barely knew, 
I must've been outta mind. 

Ohhh I 
I ll never hurt you again 
Girl I 
I know you deserve a better man 
Hey I 
I was a fool to ever let you down 
So why would you stay? 

Woman I beg your forgiveness 
And I'll do whatever it takes 
And may the Lord be my witness 
Honey I never meant to treat you this way 
Sugar your heart has been broken 
But I could still see true love shine in your eyes 
When every word has been spoken 
Woman I'll love you for the rest of my life 

Ohhh I 
I ll never hurt you again 
Girl I 
I know you deserve a better man 
Hey I 
I was a fool to ever let you down 
So why would you stay? 

Oh baby 
Don't know why, why you would stay 
Baby 
Baby 
You're my baby 
Hey girl 

Yeahhhh I 
I ll never hurt you again 
Girl I 
I know you deserve a better man 
Girl IIIIIIIIIII 
I was a fool to ever let you down 
But I want you to staaaaay 
Girl I 
I'll never hurt you again 
Baby 
I know you deserve a better man 
Girl I 
Girl I 
I was a fool to ever let you down 
But I want yooooou... to stay.---
