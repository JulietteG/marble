Baby, look how far we've come
Casualties are littered all the way
'Cause we got miles left to go
To a place that I don't know
They told me the ground was gold
But I can't see it
One last time through the woods
In my old neighborhood
It tastes so bittersweet
I can't believe it

Hands in the cement
Stickers on the ceiling
Falling asleep to the werewolves
Pop the clutch on the v-dub
Throwing pebbles at your window
As we roll away in the pouring rain---
