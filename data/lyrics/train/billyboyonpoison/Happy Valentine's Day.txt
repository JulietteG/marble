Yeah!

Well if Jesus was a sinner,
Then the devil is my friend.
And if cupid kills a lover,
Painting arrows in the air.*

All the kids are playing in the street again.

You can walk the streets for a virgin,
Or you can go to church for a whore.
You can spend your life finding something in between,
Or just have death knocking on your door.

All the kids are playing in the street again
While their mothers are busy smoking their cigarettes. 

Love is on the run.
Well you beat it for fun.*

Well you can slaughter all the Catholics,
Or torture every Jew.
Mangle Muslims, hang those Hindus.
But baby it'll be only you.

You can meet me at the public execution,
Or you can just drop by the mall.
Either way you'll have to pay
Before the last good call, yeah.

All the kids are playing in the street again
While their mothers are busy smoking their cigarettes.

All the kids are dying in the street again
While their mothers are busy smoking up their last cigarettes.
Last cigarette.---Lyrics submitted by Dylan.
