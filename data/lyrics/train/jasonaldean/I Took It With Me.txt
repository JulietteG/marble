When I passed that city limit sign
I knew that I was finally on my own
So I put my foot down on the gas
To see how fast those wheels could get me going
Everything about that place made me who I am
But they say once you leave you can't go back again

So I took it with me, that cloud of red dust rolling up
That Georgia blue sky, setting sun, straight up highway forty-one
I took it with me, that wild street, that fighting size
That on the run on a Friday night
That standing tall small town crowd
I took it with me

They say this world can change you fast
Kick you right on back where you belong
I rolled my sleeves up every day
That's just what you do where I come from

Everything I ever knew I bottled up inside
What I'd leave your side at back home
It ain't hard to find

So I took it with me, that cloud of red dust rolling up
That Georgia blue sky, setting sun, straight up highway forty-one
I took it with me, that wild street, that fighting size
That on the run on a Friday night
That standing tall small town crowd
I took it with me

I'd be a thousand miles away
But it's still crystal clear
I see that picture in my mind
I keep with right here

So I took it with me, that cloud of red dust rolling up
That Georgia blue sky, setting sun, straight up highway forty-one
I took it with me, that wild street, that fighting size
That on the run on a Friday night
That standing tall small town crowd
I took it with me ---
