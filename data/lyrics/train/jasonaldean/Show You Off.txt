We can go around, club hopping
Tell you all I want to do is drop in
Have a drink and catch a good band
Couple songs and hey we're gone again
Act like that's all we're doing, the truth is

I just want to show you off
Drive em all crazy, watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
It's a fine girl, damn, be all I ever saw
I just want to show you off

Maybe take a ride down Broadway
All the doctors and the Fords and the Chevrolets
Slow rolling, looking over and
Girl you've got that super cab glowing
Roll down that tinted window

There you go, I just want to show you off
Drive em all crazy, watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
It's a fine girl, damn
Be all I ever saw, I just want to show you off

Might look like we're just cruising, truth is, truth is

I just want to show you off
Drive em all crazy, watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
It's a fine girl, damn, be all I ever saw
I just want to show you off
I just want to show you off ---
