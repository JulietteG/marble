Nobody ever thought i'd make it in this town
they all said I should leave my truck packed and turn right back around
they said I didn't have what it takes
I needed money and a pretty face
but I just look at them and say 
(chorus)
I use what i got,
I take what I get, give till I aint got nothin left
and I give it some more and keep on climbing up that mountain
keep truckin along, work up a sweat, passed every no after no after no, till I get a yes
I dont worry bout what im not, I use what I got, yea

I still got big dreams and a strong heart
I got alot of real good friends who help me get this far,
I still got miles to go, 
its a winding uphill road
but ill get there the only way I know

(chorus)
I use what I got,
I take what I get, give till I aint got nothin left
and I give it some more and keep on climbing up that mountain
keep truckin along, work up a sweat, passed every no after no after no, till I get a yes
I don't worry bout what im not, I use what I got, yea

keep on rollin along, doin my best passed every no after no after no, till I get a yes
I dont worry bout what im not,
no no 
I dont worry bout what im not, I use what I got, yea---Lyrics submitted by Arissa.
