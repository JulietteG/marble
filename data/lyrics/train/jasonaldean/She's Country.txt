You boys know about a real country girl? Talkin, true blue, out in the woods, down home, country
She's a hot little number in her pick-up truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party-all-nighter from South Carolina, a bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a raging cajun, lunatic from Brunswick, juicy Georgia peach
With a thick southern drawl, sexy swingin walk, brother she's all

Country, (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayer she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay, country
Brother she's country

A hell raisin sugar when the sun goes down, mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey dripping honey from the hollerin Kentucky, getcha flippin kinda trippie like a Mississippi hippie,
She's a Kansas princess, crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swingin walk,
Brother she's all

Country (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayer she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay, country
Nothin but country

(thick southern drawl)
(sexy swingin walk)
(aw show 'em how a country girl does it one time now)

Brother she's country, from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin but country
Yea yeayeaaa
She's country (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayer she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised she ain't afraid to stay, country
Yea she's nothing but country

She's all about the country
From the backwoods she's a home grown down to the bone, she's country---Lyrics submitted by Kodie.
