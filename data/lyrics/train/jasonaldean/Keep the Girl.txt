This life is full of choices
Hard to make one
All the voices in my head
Those blue eyes I'm in love with
Or that highway which ever I pick
There'll be regrets

I go one way I lose everything
I go the other way same thing

I'm torn and it's tearing me apart
I want to go but I don't want to break her heart
Like a sword with a double edge blade
It's gonna cut deep either way
This little town, that big old world
Chase the dream or keep the girl

More than once I packed it all up
But I break down blame it on the truck
Just couldn't go
Just wanna be out there making my mark
Lay down every night in her arms

I'm torn and it's tearing me apart
I want to go but I don't want to break her heart
Like a sword with a double edge blade
It's gonna cut deep either way
This little town, that big old world
Chase the dream or keep the girl

I don't know why I can't have it all
Need to tear down that wall
Between this little town, that big old world
Go chase my dream and keep the girl

I'm torn and it's tearing me apart
I want to go but I don't want to break her heart
Like a sword with a double edge blade
It's gonna cut deep either way
This little town, that big old world
Chase my dream and keep the girl

I want it all, keep the girl, hey---
