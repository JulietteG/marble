Wasn't a stone I didn't throw, when I wrecked it
My foolish words so cruel and cold, We're disconnected
Tell me why, when she cried, all I did was close my eyes

If she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

Now the sunshine feels like rain, trying to drown me
And the world feels out of place, all around me
So I wait, and I pray, I'll run into her someday

If she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

So many things I wish I could tell her, show her
Just how bad I really need her, miss her, love her

If she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around

If she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now, If she could see me now---
