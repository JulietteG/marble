I was born across the river
In the mountains where I call home.
Lord, times were good there.
Don't know why I ever roamed

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We get together anytime we can.
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We play together in Mother Nature's band.

Me and my woman's done made our plans
On the Tennessee River, walkin' hand in hand
Gonna raise a famly, Lord, settle down
Where peace and love can still be found.

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We get together anytime we can.
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We play together in Mother Nature's band.---
