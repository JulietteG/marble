I'm gonna fight 'em off,
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back,
They're gonna rip it off,
Taking their time right behind my back.

And I'm talking to myself at night, because I can't forget,
Back and forth through my mind behind a cigarette.

And a message coming from my eyes says 'leave it alone',
No, leave it alone,
Says leave it alone,
Oh leave it alone.
Don't wanna hear about it,
Every single one's got a story to tell,
Everyone knows about it,
From the Queen of England to the hounds of Hell.

And if I catch you coming back my way,
I'm gonna sell it to you, yeah,
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do.

And a feeling coming from my bones, says 'find a home',
Oh, find a home,
Find a home.

I'm gonna fight 'em off,
Seven nation army couldn't hold me back,
They're gonna rip it off.

And a feeling coming from my bones, says 'find a home',
Find a home,
Go back home,
Go back home,
You better go back home! ---
