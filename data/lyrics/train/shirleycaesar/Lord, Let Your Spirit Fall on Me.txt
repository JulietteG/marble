Now Lord, how can I forget all
The things that you have done for me, yeah
One day you shook my dungeon
And you set me free

And Ive got a made up mind
Im ready to shout about it
Because youre with me all the time
Lord walk in front of me
And hold my hand
Lord let your spirit lead me

So many things that I just cant understand

And youll brighten up our way

I know that I wont stray
Lord keep your hands on me

Bridge
Jesus said, the spirit of the Lord is upon me
He has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor
He has sent me to heal the broken hearted
The recovering of sight to the blind
To set at liberty them that are bruised
An To preach the acceptable year unto the Lord
All hes saying to you right now
He wants to fall on you

Let it fall on me Lord

Keep your hands on me
Repeat 4x ---
