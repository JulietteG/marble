VERSE 1
You may be down and feel like God
Has somehow forgotten
That you are faced with circumstances
You can't get through
But now it seems that there's no way out
And you're going under
God's proven time and time again
He'll take care of you

CHORUS
And He'll do it again
He'll do it again
If you'll just take a look
At where you are now
And where you've been
Well hasn't He always come through for you
He's the same now as then
You may not know how
You may not know when
But He'll do it again

VERSE 2
God knows the things you're going through
And He knows how you're hurting
You see he knows just how you're heart
Has been broken in two
But He's the God of the stars, of the sun and the sea
And He is your Father
You see He can calm the storm
And He'll find some way to fix it for you

CHORUS

BRIDGE
Oh He's still God and He will not fail you
Oh He's still God and He will not change
Know, Know that He's God and He's fighting for you
Yes, just like Moses, just like Daniel,
And just like Shadrach and Meshach, Abednego

CHORUS

TAG
You may not know how
And you may not know when
You may not know how
You may not know when
But I know that He'll do it again
He'll do it again, again---Lyrics submitted by Marlene Cherry.
