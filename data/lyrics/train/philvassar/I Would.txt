If I could take it all and change it
Take the past and rearrange it I would, baby, yes, I would
If I could figure out the reason
Go back in time and change the season I would
Baby, yes, I would
And I'd be the man that you can't live without
I'd be rewriting parts
And turn you back around
I would do anything to bring you back
But it's all over and your gone
And I just can't do that

I'd make you laugh
I'd learn to cry
Learn to dance
Just for one more chance
Something I could do to make it good
Baby, I would

If I could say goodbye and face it
Take the pain and just erase it, I would
Yes, I would
And if I could just feel better
Break it down to the letter, I would
Yes, I would
I don't know what happened to you and yesterday
I can' t get back there but if I could find a way

I'd make you laugh
I'd learn to cry
Learn to dance
Just for one more chance
Something I could do to make it good
Baby, I would
Well, I would

I'd make you laugh
I'd learn to cry
Learn to dance
Just for one more chance
Something I could do to make it good
Baby, I would
Well, I would
Well ya know I would
I would---Lyrics submitted by brandi.
