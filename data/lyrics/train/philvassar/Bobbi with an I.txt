Wooo 
Yeah baby 
That's right now 
C'mon 
Here we go! 
Alright now 
I I I I I... 
I I I I I... 

Well Bobbi's been a friend since i cant remember when 
We all went together to school 
A linebacker, a quarterback sacker 
Yeahhh Bobbi he's as strong as a mule 
So imagine our shock 
'Bout ten o'clock down at the Whistle Stop one weekend 
Yeah the whole place stopped 
You coulda heard a chin drop 
The minute he walked in 
Cuz it was Bobbi with an I 

{Chorus} 

He isnt just one of the guys 
In his pink party dress 
You never would guess 
He benches 335 
You better watch how much you drink 
He might look better than you think 
If it's the big-boned girl with a platinum curl 
Hey then don't be surprised 
Yeah that's just Bobbi with a 
I I I I I... 
I I I I I... 

Now Monday mornin' he'll be be drivin' that tow truck 
And he ain't takin' no lip 
He's been known to knock a few teeth out 
If you ask him for a beauty tip 
So we live and let live 
That's how it is nobody gives a second thought these days 
But if somebody hollers 
"Hey there's a chick in the men's room!" 
We just smile and say 
No that's just Bobbi with an I 

{Chorus} 

He isnt just one of the guys 
In his pink party dress 
You never would guess 
He benches 335 
You better watch how much you drink 
He might look better than you think 
If it's the big-boned girl with a platinum curl 
Hey then don't be surprised 
Yeah that's just Bobbi with a 

Hey (Hey) Who's that girl (Who's that girl) with those shapely sexy thighs? 
That's just Bobbi with an I 

{Chorus} 

He isnt just one of the guys 
In his pink party dress 
You never would guess 
He benches 335 
You better watch how much you drink 
He might look better than you think 
If it's the big-boned girl with a platinum curl 
Hey then don't be surprised 
Yeah that's just Bobbi with a 
I I I I I...
