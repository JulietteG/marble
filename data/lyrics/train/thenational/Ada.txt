Ada dont talk about reasons why you dont want to talk about reasons
why you dont wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
all alone. all together, all together in the dark
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada put the sounds of your house in a song
try to be speechless for a minute
If you think you gonna faint go out in the hallway
Let them all have your neck
Ada dont stay in the lake too long
it lives alone and it barely knows you
Itll have a nervous breakdown and fall
into a thousand pieces around you

Stand inside an empty tuxedo with grapes in my mouth
waiting for Ada
Ada hold onto yourself by the sleeves
I think everything counts a little more than we think
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada Ada Ada Ada
Ada I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall

Ada dont talk about reasons why you dont want to talk about reasons
why you dont wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
all alone. all together, all together in the dark
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada Ada Ada Ada
Ada I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall
Ada Ada Ada Ada
Ada, Ive been hoping you know your way around---Lyrics submitted by Deah.
