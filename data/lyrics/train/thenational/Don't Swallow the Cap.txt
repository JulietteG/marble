Pull out breaks behind the houses
I don't see what's strange about this.
Tiny bubbles hang above me.
It's a sign that someone loves me.
I can hardly stand upright
Hit my head up on the light
I have faith but don't believe you
This love ain't enough to leave you.

Everything I love is on the table.
Everything I love is out to sea.

I have only two emotions,
Careful fear and dead devotion.
I can't get the balance right.
Throw my marbles in the fight.
I see all the ones I wept for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear
Cause I was not supposed to be here.

Everything I love is on the table.
Everything I love is out to sea.
I'm not alone,
I'll never be.
Into the bone,
I'll never grieve.

I'm tired, I'm freezing, I'm dumb
When it gets so late I forget everyone.
I need somewhere to stay.
Don't think anybody I know is awake.
Calm down, it's alright,
Keep my arms the rest of the night.
When they ask what do I see,
I see a bright white beautiful heaven hangin' over me.

I'm not alone,
I'll never be.
Into the bone,
I'll never grieve.
And if you want, (too seriously)
To see me cry. (don't swallow the cap)
Play "Let It Be" (pat yourself on the back)
Or "Nevermind". (too seriously)

There's a time to leave, there's a time to think about
What I wanna say to the girls at the door.
I need somewhere to be
But I can't get around the river in front of me.
Come down, it's alright,
Lead my arms the rest of the night.
When they ask what do I see,
I see a bright white beautiful heaven hangin' over me.

I'm not alone, (too seriously)
I'll never be. (don't swallow the cap)
Into the bone, (pat yourself on the back)
I'll never grieve (too seriously)
And if you want, (too seriously)
To see me cry, (don't swallow the cap)
Play "Let It Be" (pat yourself on the back)
Or "Nevermind". (too seriously) ---Lyrics submitted by Jack Prick.
