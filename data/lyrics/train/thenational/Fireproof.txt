You keep a lot of secrets
And I keep none
Wish I could go back
And keep some

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
Its just the way you are

You tell me youre waiting
To find someone
Who isnt so hopeless
But theres no one

Youre fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
Youre fireproof
Howd you get so far?

You're a needle in the hay
You're the water at the door
Youre a million miles away
Doesnt matter anymore

Jennifer you are not the only reason
My head is boiling and my hands are freezing
Jennifer you are not the only one
To sit awake until the wild feelings leave you

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
Its just the way you are

Youre fireproof
Thats what you always say
Youre fireproof
I wish I was that way---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
