Stormy woman salty girl
You were the sunshine of the world
It was a good idea
To fall down here

Stormy woman what's troublin' you now
You're breakin' up the sky
It was a good idea
To fall down here

Stormy woman come dry your eyes
I will speak the love I feel tonight
It was a good idea
To fall down here

Stormy woman borrowing time
What's been broken is never far behind
Stormy woman caught in the undertow
Beside the true blue notes
It was a good idea
To fall down here

Stormy woman salty girl
Stormy woman salty girl
Stormy woman salty girl---Lyrics submitted by Laeryn.
