Maybe you think that your nylon, you seem to say your children of the world and maybe you think your an astronaut from stary swine your harvesting your pearls jumpsuit of green and your cardboard wings though you are silent you say everything and i think its come alive its on the rise its on the rise and i think its come alive its on the rise its on the rise maybe you think its pornography you seem to say im the people of the world and maybe you think your a genius retared bloom your banner is unfurled now you are selling the touch of your hands how much salvation can my stomach stand and i think its come alive its on the rise its on the rise and i think its come alive its on the rise its on the rise maybe you think this is nowhere you seem to say im a children of the world and maybe you think your an astronaut from stary swine your harvesting your pearls jumpsuit of green and your card board wings though you are silent you say everything and i think its come alive its on the rise its on the rise and i think its come alive its on the rise its on the rise and i think its come alive its on the rise its on the rise and i think its come alive its on the rise its on the rise---Lyrics submitted by claudia.
