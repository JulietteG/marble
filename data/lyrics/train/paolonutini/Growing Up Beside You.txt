Sitting beside you in school, 
While we'd paint I'd make you laugh.
Mine was never very good, 
Yours looked exactly like the photograph.
Looks like I'm growing, I'm growing up beside you.

I don't always get the way you feel, 
But now I've learned to live with that.
It's like I'm a part of something real.
I was hittin' the bottle, now I've broken the seal.
Looks like I'm growing, I'm growing up beside you

And the sun sets the scene, 
While the rain misses me.
And all the time I'll be growing, growing up beside you.

Oh, The sun sets the scene, 
While the rain misses me.
And all the time I'll be growing, growing up beside you

Yeah, uuh uhh uhh.---Lyrics submitted by Pernille.
