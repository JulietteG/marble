My hopes are high but my eyes can't
Believe what they see, 
Give me something to believe, 
Give me something to believe, 
I got lucky in life and had plenty to eat and
I saw this world as one big pool of opportunity
But there's too much mind corruption, 
Too little remedy (or that's how it seems to me)
Yeah we need a moral education to
Set the young minds free... 

So let us change what we can and
Accept what we can't
Impart some of the wisdom
From that tried and tested man
There's no harm in being wrong you know no, 
In fact to me, it's common ground - yeah
So take that feather from you cap sir, 
And pass that feather around.

My hopes are high but my eyes can't
Believe what they see, 
Give me something to believe in, 
Give me something to believe.

(Uhh)

My hopes are high but my eyes can't
Believe what they see
My hopes are high
Give me something, 
Give me something to believe---Lyrics submitted by Pernille.
