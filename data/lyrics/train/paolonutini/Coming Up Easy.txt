Sunday morning, got the hazy, hazy janes,
I turn to you and inhale you where you lay.
Took a wander through the garden,
To await the long, long day,
And then roll for a while on a violet flowerbed.

Oh, you kiss my lips again and again and again,
And then again, and then..

We would watch the sun coming up easy,
While the rain came tumbling down,
And it washed our bodies so clean,
That we would seem to rise up off of the cold, cold ground
It's a shame the way it seems to go

'Cause now my best friend, my partner in crime
I'm afraid it looks like we're gonna have to go our separate ways,
'cause you see the thing is, I love you, I love you.
But you see, I resent you all the same.
And all my other friends they're just saying you're slowing me down.

Oh, but I should have known you'd turn to me and say,
Before you through too much of me away
Don't you remember seeing the sun coming up easy
While the rain came tumbling down?
And it washed our bodies so clean,
that we could see it rise up off of the cold, cold ground.

I see the sun coming up easy,
while the rain came tumbling down.
And it washed our bodies so clean
That we could see it rise up off of the cold, cold ground

It was in love I was created and in love is how I hope I die.
Yeah it was in love I was created and in love is how I hope I die (x3)

We watched the sun coming up easy (x4)

It was in love I was created and in love is how I hope I die (x2)

We watched the sun coming up easy (x3)---Lyrics submitted by Pernille.
