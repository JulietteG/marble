Mrs. Brown you've got a lovely daughter
girls as sharp as her are somethin' rare
but it's sad, she doesn't love me now
she's made it clear enough it ain't no good to pine

She wants to return those things I bought her
tell her she can keep them just the same
things have changed, she doesn't love me now
she's made it clear enough it ain't no good to pine

walkin' about, even in a crowd, well
you'll pick her out, makes a bloke feel so proud

If she finds that I've been round to see you (round to see you)
tell her that I'm well and feelin' fine (feelin fine)
Don't let on, don't say she's broke my heart
I'd go down on my knees but it's no good to pine

Walkin' about, even in a crowd, well
you'll pick her out, makes a bloke feel so proud

If she finds that I've been round to see you (round to see you)
tell her that I'm well and feelin' fine (feelin fine)
Don't let on, don't say she's broke my heart
I'd go down on my knees but it's no good to pine

Mrs. Brown you've got a lovely daughter (lovely daughter)
Mrs. Brown you've got a lovely daughter (lovely daughter)
Mrs. Brown you've got a lovely daughter (lovely daughter)
Mrs. Brown you've got a lovely daughter (lovely daughter)---Lyrics submitted by Pamela.
