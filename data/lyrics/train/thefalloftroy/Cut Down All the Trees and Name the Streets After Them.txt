Break yourself, not coming out of this foolish game.
What could I have said?
If you're uncomfortable, baby please tell me.
Point me to the right place.

Run there, if you're going, then I'm taking you away with me... 
(Just because)
(Just because)
If I had my way, I'd lie to you and tell the truth, I'm joking. 
Get away from me. 
(Just because)
(Just because)

Did his helpless hands, take you away from this. 
Did it feel so good? Oh no... Yeah!?
I didn't get the feeling you had an answer.
Explain yourself!! 
God it feels surreal.

Run there, if you're going, then I'm taking you away with me... 
(Just because)
If I had my way, I'd lie to you and tell the truth, I'm joking. 
Get away from me. 
(Just because)
(Just because)

Break yourself, without a moment to,
Embellish truth... Signed by you.
Hear the roar, and in a second more,
You'll be overboard... 
Goodbye...

This is where we stand!
This is where we stand!

This is where we stand!
This is where we stand!

This is where we stand!
This is where we stand!---Lyrics submitted by Avery.
