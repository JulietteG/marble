One more time, just enough to ease my mind.
Everything's fine, when it's only you and I...
And I cry because loss like this just don't make sense.
I try, but I just can't grasp why...

Waste the whole night away.
I don't know what to say.
Disregard everything.
Just can't feel anything.

Now it's you, I still can't believe it's true.
Down here it's cold, when I let myself go.
It's contrived, and inside I think I died, but I'll go on...
You always on my side.

Just to hear your voice speak one more word.
Just to see you smile!!!

Waste the whole night away.
I don't know what to say.
Disregard everything.
Just can't feel anything.---Lyrics submitted by Avery.
