Slow down this is slippin' trough my mind,
This conversation has run out of time.
Honey I know you know what I mean,
And that's the one thing that you soon will find.
I know that you really wanna go,
My mind is runnin' outta gas just relax,
And recap, and relapse.
Tonight, my bodies jumpin' and I,
Go through the motions and I'm leaving on this journey,
Maybe someday I'll come running home to you.

I don't wanna see the day, my words cannot make it safe.
(Come running home! Come running home!)
Her heart in my hands, it's too bad, no regrets...
I don't wanna see the day, her tears are falling on my grave.
(Come running home! Come running home!)
This is my one chance, to take back, no regrets...

Let's go! I just wanna let you know,
This situation leaves me outta breath.
We'll drive till the love that's in your eyes,
Drops to the ground and unravels like a thread...
I know that you really wanna go,
I only think about her, must get to her, cannot lose her.
You know that I will not let this die,
Life support systems and my mind on
Rewind and rewind and rewind...

I don't wanna see the day, my words cannot make it safe.
(Come running home! Come running home!)
Her heart in my hands, it's too bad, no regrets...
I don't wanna see the day, her tears are falling on my grave.
(Come running home! Come running home!)
This is my one chance, to take back, no regrets...

I don't wanna see the day, my words cannot make it safe.
Her heart in my hands, it's too bad, no regrets...
I don't wanna see the day, her tears are falling on my grave.
This is my one chance....my one chance....my one chance---Lyrics submitted by Fred.
