When no-one is forgotten
When nothing goes to waste
When sadness turns to laughter
When anger is defaced
Youll start to know the way I feel about you

When weakness turns to power
When evil turns to good
When the helplesss are remembered
By those who never would
Youll start to know the way I feel about you

And if I could, Id run out into the street
And scream to everone I meet
That I loved you more than words could ever say
And that I loved you more than life this Fathers Day

When caring is exaulted
When kindness knows no bounds
When integrity comes easy
When love is all around
Youll start to know the way I feel about you

And if I could, Id run out into the world
And tell every boy and girl
To love before love takes itself away
Just like Im loving you this Fathers Day---Lyrics submitted by Joshua.
