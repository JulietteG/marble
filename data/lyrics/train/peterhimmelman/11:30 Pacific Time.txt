Oh baby what you dont know
Floodgates bout to overflow
Ive been holdin it back for reasons even I dont understand
Somewhere deep beneath my skin
Theres a feelin Ive been holding in
For so long now that I can hardly find it

Theres a candle burnin and the tvs on
Im sittin here tryin to force this song
While the feeling tears itself loose from my soul
I wanna tell you bout the rain and this Chinese man
I wanna listen to the music of Chopin
I wanna kiss your face so bad Im cryin

At 11:30 Pacific time, look up at the moon
Ill be on the East Coast watching too
At 11:30 Pacific time, look up at the moon
At least thats something we can do together soon

Theres a madness in me, I dont know why
Maybe its because Im afraid to die
And maybe thats the reason Im afraid to keep on livin
So many times Ive let you down
When all you needed was to hear the sound 
Of my voice as it whispers that I love you

The house is empty but my heart is full 
I need so much to lose control
And blow like a wild Pacific wind
I wanna cry in your arms and laugh by the sea
I wanna feel your body next to me
And make love til we fall asleep together

At 11:30 Pacific time, look up at the moon
Ill be on the East Coast watching too
At 11:30 Pacific time, look up at the moon
At least thats something we can do together soon---Lyrics submitted by Joshua.
