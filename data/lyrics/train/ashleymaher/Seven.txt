deny whats wild
and run the risk
of perishing in her flames

shell rise
shell defy you
despite your moves
to sully her bad name

shes yours, alone
shes crucial to the truth
you seek

you cannot grow
until you know
just what she is needing
down down deep beneath

oh, 
seven seven seven
the angels on the way
singing songs to carry on
carry on till Christmas Day
seven seven seven
the devils round the room
singing, Throw your cloak away!
Howl at the midnight moon.

I seek the place
where devils and angels sing together
one love, but many-a-face
subject to the same holy weather

trade in your wings
for one night on the town, wherever
she may reveal just what you feel
for feelings cannot stay undercover

oh, 
seven seven seven
the angels on the way
singing songs to carry on
carry on till Christmas Day
seven seven seven
the devils round the room
singing, Throw your cloak away!
Howl at the midnight moon.

now some go a wandring
down some dark alley
winding their way back
to the same painful valley
and some cant find fire
fast enough to be burned
just what was that thing
we were here to learn?

I tried to hide
my hungers when they rose to greet me
We will be fed,
is what they said
long before they grew to defeat me

but sometimes,
behind the devils cry 
is some worthy yearning
a need for love
some song of comfort
for a hurting soul whos heart is burning

oh, 
seven seven seven
the angels on the way
singing songs to carry on
carry on till Christmas Day
seven seven seven
the devils round the room
singing, Throw your cloak away!
Howl at the midnight moon.

hooves for haloes
wings for horns
countless the way
to be born

seven seven seven---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
