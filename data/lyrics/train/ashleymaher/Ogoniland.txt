how full the force can be
hidden in a single man
how full the force we see
flowing from a solitary hand

for the word branches back to the pen
and he pen branches back to the hand
and the hand to the heart
to the deep deep roots in ogoniland
ogoniland

how tight the grip can be
hidden from the common eye
yet lip to lip are we
the west and the rest 
of our partners in crime

for the word branches back to the pen
and he pen branches back to the hand
and the hand to the heart
to the deep deep roots in ogoniland
ogoniland

high up over the pipelines
high up over the pipelines
silent, the mouth of the light lines
high up over the pipelines
tied up over the pipelines
silent, the mouth of the light lines
ogoniland 
ogoniland 
ogoniland  oh

how full the force can be
hidden in a single man
watch how the words he speaks
beckon until we understand

for the word branches back to the pen
and the pen branches 
through to the land
to the roots
to the roots
to the deep deep roots in ogoniland
ogoniland

radiant his laughter
carefree to what may come
why does justice only follow 
the setting sun

saro-wiwa, may your children grow
to see alls not lost
may they dance across your delta
may your root words never rest
never rest
never rest---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
