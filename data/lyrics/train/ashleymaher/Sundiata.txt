headphones
headlights
heading home
traffic lights

good kid
fine mind
on the eve of leaving
his childhood behind

he says the music makes him move
with a certain swing
makes him feel like hes at one
with everything
and though the sound is known alone
to only him
the game of Life today is his to win

chorus
you know, you know
know the road to come
and truth is truth
true, we all are one
but whenever you need them
the old songs are here
for whenever the water
is too cold to clear
they are calling out, calling out
the name of an ancient king
Sundiata you can know
whatever your travels may bring
come home

headphones
hip hop
good friends
dont stop
basketball
fingers crossed
cultures crossing 
with nothing lost

he says the music makes him strong
in a certain way
push, pushing him along
to face the day
he feels the energy and wisdom
behind the words
listing our divisions
as they blur

chorus
you know, you know
know the road to come
and truth is truth
true, we all are one
but whenever you need them
the old songs are here
for whenever the water
is too cold to clear
they are calling out, calling out
the name of an ancient king
Sundiata you can know
whatever your travels may bring
come home

you know, you know
know the road to come
and truth is truth
true, we all are one
come home---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
