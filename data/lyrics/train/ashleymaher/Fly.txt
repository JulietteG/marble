whistling on a windy day
Im a bird above
a bird above
a bird above
a beating bird above

twisting to the to and fro-ing
of a roaring sky

up down, deep, or far away
Im a bird above
a bird above
a bird above
a beating bird above

peering through the secret seeking 
of an eagle eye
I fly

fly fly fly fly
fly fly fly fly

lovers never calculate
is this the way?
is that the way?
is this the way?
is this or that the way?

mothers love their children
turn they murderer or saint
cut and toss it all away

all that
is this the way?
is that the way?
is this the way?
is this or that the way?

feel your face
asleep beneath a billion coats of paint
and fly

fly fly fly fly
fly fly fly fly

when the weather tells its tale to you
wing or feather
let them surrender too
if you sense the scent 
is true to you
its a clue to the truth

saving for a rainy day
we play the part
we play the part
we play the part
we, daily, play the part

twisting down the flower bounty
of October trees

but, coffers fill and drain away
while we play the part
we play the part
we play the part
we, daily, play the part

and our eagle wings 
keep beating windward
when were on our knees
to fly

fly fly fly fly
fly fly fly fly

learn to be happy with nothing
if you cant be happy with nothing
how can you be happy 
with something
when something 
walks through the door?

seek the source of your wanting
if you cant be clear
what youre wanting
how can you be clear 
about something
when something seems to want
more more more more more 
more more more more more 
more more more more more 
more more more more more
more?---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
