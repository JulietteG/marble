back in the hair salon
the music's off, not on
it's peaceful and efficient
no one's in today

she's chatting chatting
the woman's cutting cutting
and captured is my mother 
in the middle of the day

she's captured
enraptured
she's weaving stories as she stares
at her reflection
what's the connection
between this face, this hair
and the Big Grace she'd be needing, to repair?

her face is thinner now
her eyes are big, somehow
her body tired with the fight
roaring subtle, day and night

the days exasperate
the day's to celebrate
the night's a lonely moon
will she go slow slow slow 
slow or soon?

but she says,
fight, fight
the dimming of the fire
why? 
when outside, the world is so alive
i'll be the last leaf on the tree
no, not i
i won't go out gracefully

back in the hair salon
shes got the rollers on
shes getting ready for tomorrow
when a friend comes to town

we've cleaned the curtains again
the house is perfect for when
that friend's at the door
she'll be a beauty queen once more


but its the nights
when she fights
shes weaving stories as she stares
out at the moon
will I see june?

or just the dark, the dark
and these fevers 
dancing green around my bed

but she says,
fight, fight
the dimming of the fire
why?
when outside, the world is so alive
i'll be the last leaf on the tree
no, not i
i won't go out gracefully

oh, keep me colored like the spring
i won't reveal my broken wing
i'll still be standing when the storm
has left the forest cracked and torn

i'll still be dancing in the light
long past this shift 
from day to night
for maybe he waits out at sea
holding deep deep water 
roses for me
holding deep deep water 
roses for me

oh my mother
fragile as a feather
fiercer than a tiger in defense of those she loves
so fixed and loyal
kind and royal
the pride of a lion
the ideals of a dove

fight, fight
the dimming of the fire
why, when outside, 
the world is so alive
i'll be the last leaf on the tree
no, not i
i won't go out gracefully
deep water roses .---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
