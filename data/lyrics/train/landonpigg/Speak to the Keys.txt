Make a joyful noise. A song that surpasses understanding.  A song that speaks to the deaf.  Speak to the keys.  And let the keys speak.  And let the keys speak.  Speak to the keys.  And let the keys speak.  Just let the keys speak to you.  All the way through the night.  It will cradle your mind.  It fills your head from ear to ear.  Speak to the keys.  And let the keys speak.  And let the keys speak.  Speak to the keys.  And let the keys speak.  Just let the keys speak.  From ear to ear, there is no room.  From ear to ear, there is no room.  For anything.  From ear to ear, there is no room.  For anything but beauty here.  Symphonies will fill your dreams.  Melodies sing you to sleep.  Speak to the keys.  And let the keys speak.  And let the keys speak.  Speak to the keys.  And let the keys speak.  Just let the keys speak to you.---Lyrics submitted by Misha.
