I held you last night while I was dreaming
We walked hand in hand like lovers do
You kissed my lips and smiled now I'm believing
We were almost like a dream come true

(chorus)
With each moment we found love unending
A pretty picture all wrapped up just for me and you
Such a pretty world sure makes a perfect memory
We were almost like a dream come true

When I woke up and you were here beside me
And for just a moment there my heart cried out for you
When you call my name now once again I'm smiling
For I realize our love's a dream come through

(chorus)

Each day with you Sweetheart's 
A dream come true---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
