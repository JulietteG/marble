I'm calling from a payphone
I was heading out of town
I really meant to leave this time
But I guess I'm having doubts
It's hard for me to walk away
From all we could have had
So I'm calling just to tell you where I'm at

(chorus)
I'm at the corner or walk and don't walk
And I can't make up my mind
One way leads me back to you
And one leaves you behind
I'm standing at the crossroads
And I'm really in some pain
At the corner of walk and don't walk darling
And the light's about to change

I'm hoping that you'll tell me
To turn my car around
That you never meant to hurt me 
And you'll make it up somehow
But the phone just keeps on ringing
And though my heart's had enough
I just can't bring myself to hang it up 

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
