Tamika
I don't wanna wait 'till tommorrow
Cause everyday I'm away from you
I feel so bad
Oh cause I need someone
In my life
Lately I don't know if it's wrong or right
All I know is I just don't wanna wait 'till tommorow
Cause you mean

Chorus
You mean the world to me
Tamika
You are my everything
Tamika

I shouldn't have to wait 'till tommorow
I wouldn't hesitate for a yes or no
Why don't you tell me

If I'd be a part of you
Cause I want so much to be
With you

Chorus

They say the sun'll come out tommorrow
Everybody have ta follow
When ya meet that girl named Tamika
She'll make you beg til tomorrow
Best friends with the girls, but man's best sorrow
We got the sticky sticky
Yah yah yah....
Eddie L version to make the 
People go waiiian
In Tamika style---Lyrics submitted by Jetaime.
