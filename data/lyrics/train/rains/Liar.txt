Lying on the bottom of a riverbed
Emotions are crumbling
An avalanche in the evening
Tonight
The story of a life made up in his head
He'd die for belief from her he knows he needs her
Everything he wanted is a lie
Convincing her is his only goal tonight

Don't, label me a liar
Don't, label me a liar
Don't, label me a liar
Don't, label me a liar

Think about days when happiness came
Through your eyes and into mine
Those were the best days of my life
Think about days when there was no time
And we would leave our house of lies
Those were the best days of my life
Now the days are cold and the nights are long
And I pray that you'll be coming home
Can I convince you of this lie

Don't, label me a liar
Don't, label me a liar
Don't, label me a liar
Don't, label me a liar

Are your night that long
I'm a liar
Are your nights that cold
I'm a liar
Are your night that long
I'm a liar
Are your nights that cold
I'm a liar

Don't, label me a liar
Don't, label me a liar
Don't, label me a liar
Don't, label me a liar ---Lyrics submitted by Amber Lea Doles.
