The storm was blowing from the south
The blood was running from your mouth
I recall the music playing
Couldn't hear what you were saying
The cat was howling, yowling, wanting out

You may not believe me
Baby, when i tell you
That i am mr. superlove

The glass was shattered on the floor
A hundred pieces maybe more
I remember you were crying
Just before you sent it flying
The sirens sounding
The pounding on the door

You may not believe me
Baby, when i tell you
That i am mr. superlove

Your clothes were lying on the chair
Your face was hidden by your hair
And all that i could think of then
Was what it must have felt like when
You were flying naked
Headlong down the stairs

You may not believe me
Baby, when i tell you
That i am mr. superlove---Lyrics submitted by Harrison.
