I'm standing here paralyzed
So helpless right before your eyes
And all that you can seem to do is look away
I know this weight that's on my shoulders
Is telling me it's really over
And now goodbye's the only thing that's left to say

You were always worth the risk
But how'd it come to this

Cause I've opened up my heart to bleed
I Let you have the best of me
But you wouldn't let me love you
You couldn't let me love you
I tried to give you what you need
But it took so long to finally see
That you wouldn't let me love you
Couldn't let me love you

Somehow you said all the right things
To cover up the pain you're hiding
And never let me in close enough to touch
You live with all these walls around you
Impossible for me to break through
And baby even I can only fight so much

And it's cutting me so deep
Promises I tried to keep

Cause I've opened up my heart to bleed
I let you have the best of me
But you wouldn't let me love you
You couldn't let me love you
I lied to give you what you need
But it took so long to finally see
That you wouldn't let me love you
Couldn't let me love you

And you should have been the one
The more I love, the more you run

I opened up my heart to bleed
I let you have the best of me
But you wouldn't let me love you
You couldn't let me love you
I tried to give you what you need
But it took so long to finally see
That you wouldn't let me love you
Couldn't let me love you

Couldn't let me, wouldn't let me
You wouldn't let me love you
Couldn't let me, wouldn't let me

I'm standing here paralyzed
So helpless right before your eyes
And all that you can do is look away ---Lyrics submitted by ystein Moe.
