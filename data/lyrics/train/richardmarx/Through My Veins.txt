I saw you sitting by the window
Of a caf I passed by
And though clearly my reflection
It was your face I recognized

And after all these years Im still right here
Where you left me

And Ive been calling out
Believing you would answer
But Ill try to let go now
Cause its you running through
My veins

Youd come by when I was dreaming
But lately youve been gone
Maybe Ive been trying too hard
And maybe you just moved on

I guess theres not a lot that you forgot
To tell me

And Ive missed you hanging round
And the way we were together
But I cant let go now
Cause its you running through
My veins

Oh
Its you running through my veins
Oh
And its you running through my veins
Oh
Its you running through my veins---Lyrics submitted by Michele.
