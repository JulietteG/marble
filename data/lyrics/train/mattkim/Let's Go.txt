Oooooo o-oo o-oo [x4]

I was up in my head
For everything I've said
Caught a million words
They're all made with lead
I bought a megaphone
You used inside your home
Forgot the batteries
But that's the old me

Shouting out of my windows
Roll down
Cause I don't care anymore
Said I don't care
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

Oooooo o-oo o-oo [x4]
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

Standing on the top
Of a parking lot
I gave it all I had
Show me what you've got
There's some things I've found
That make so much sound
All these words, I don't need 'em now

Shouting out of my windows
Roll down
Cause I don't care anymore
Said I don't care
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

Oooooo o-oo o-oo [x4]
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

Say what you wanna say
Make it mean everything
Oh, say what you wanna say
Make it mean everything
Say what you wanna say
Make it mean everything
Oh, say what you wanna say
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

Oooooo o-oo o-oo
(Hey hey hey hey)
Oooooo o-oo o-oo
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Oooooo o-oo o-oo
(Hey hey hey hey)
Oooooo o-oo o-oo
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

Say what you wanna say
Make it mean everything
Oh, say what you wanna say
Make it mean everything
Say what you wanna say
Make it mean everything
Oh, say what you wanna say
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
