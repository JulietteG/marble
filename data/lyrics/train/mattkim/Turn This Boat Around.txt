Please direct my calls
Like string and cans in through halls
I made some out lead
And tried them out in bed
Couldn't make it through the walls

Turn this boat around
We're starting to go down
But it begins to rain
You forgot how dark it stains
Thought it was a drought

La la la leave it all behind
La la la see the fight
La la la make the best of it
La la la and goodnight

Left turn look both ways
Take breaks on cloudy days
With miles and miles of roads
How'd you know which ones have holes?
I'm glad we didn't stay

La la la leave it all behind
La la la see the fight
La la la and in the end
La la la and goodnight---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
