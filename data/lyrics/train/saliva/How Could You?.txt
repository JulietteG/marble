I'm addicted to
Everything you do
I'm dying inside

Your sucking me down
It makes me feel,
I'm gonna drown
It's killing me now
All you do is bring me down
All this time and all your lies
It has been no surprise
Now I realize it now

(chorus)
How could you cheat on me
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies and hypnotized and I believed
How could you cheat on me
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies and hypnotized and I believed

I'm coming to know all the secrets you hold
You think I'm a fool and I don't know what you do
But I look in your eyes and I finally realize

In all this time and all your lies
It has been no surprise now I realize and now

(Chorus)
How could you cheat on me
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies and hypnotized and I believed
How could you cheat on me
Then turn you back on me
You told me all the lies and hypnotized and I believed

And now with all your pride
You still can't look me in my eyes
And now in all your shame
You can't even speak my name 

(Chorus)
How could you cheat on me
Then turn your back on me
You told me all the lies and hypnotized and I believed
How could you cheat on me
Then turn you back on me
You told me all the lies and hypnotized and I believed

I'm addicted to every single thing you do
I'm dying inside....---Lyrics submitted by kassi.
