Love to be beside you and the way you smell
The way your lips feel and your fingernails
The way your fingers crawl up my spine,
Though you always make me the last in line

I carry the weight of the world as the past is unfurled, but I won't stop to wonder
Going through this life on my own made me cold as a stone; I'm a ship going under

And I'd tell you this, but I don't know how
And I'm caving in, and I'm falling out
And I can't resist, and I can't rebound
with the weight of the world as the world falls down

It's the way you thrill me, then pull away
The way you seem to kill me, a little more each day
And it's what you're thinking in your twisted mind
The way your body trembles, when it's next to mine

I carry the weight of the world as the past is unfurled, but I won't stop to wonder
Going through this life on my own made me cold as a stone; I'm a ship going under

And I'd tell you this, but I don't know how
And I'm caving in, and I'm falling out
And I can't resist, and I can't rebound
With the weight of the world as the world falls down

And I'd tell you this, but I don't know how
And I'm caving in, and I'm falling out
And I can't resist, and I can't rebound
With the weight of the world as the world falls down

(I feel the weight of the world as it's falling down)
(I feel the weight of the world as it's falling down)
(I feel the weight of the world as it's falling down)
(I feel the weight of the world as it's falling down)

This pain I think about it everyday
it tells me I'm never gonna get away
I know it's over, but I can't escape
memories and how to face another day---Lyrics submitted by alexis.
