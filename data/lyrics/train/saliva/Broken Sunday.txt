I looked up at the stars tonight,
To see your face and to feel your presence now,
I need you here right now..
I came from a lonely place,
Windows strewn in my darkest hour now,
I need you here right now,
I need you here,
Cos you won't leave me lonely,
Cos I can't go on,
You won't leave me broken,
In a world that's not my home,

Cos I'll be gone,
Until forever,
I'll be home,
Goodbye my broken Sunday.

One love and one escape,
To another place where the pain and fear fade out,
I need you here right now,
I need you here cos you won't leave me lonely,
Cos I can't go on,
You won't leave me broken,
In a world that's not my home,

Cos I'll be gone,
Until forever..
I'll be home, until my name is etched in stone,
Oh, and we will never be alone,
Goodbye my broken Sunday.

You won't leave me lonely,
Cos I can't go on,
You won't leave me broken,
In a world that's not my home.

Cos I'll be gone,
Until forever..
I'll be home,
Until my name is etched in stone,
Oh,
And we will never be alone,
Goodbye my broken Sunday.---Lyrics submitted by vasundhara.
