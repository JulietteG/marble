Oh baby. 

Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shinin', 
Like a star that can't wait for night. 
I hate to think I been blinded baby. 
Why can't I see you tonight? 
An' the warmth of your smile starts a burnin' 
An' the thrill of your touch give me fright 
And I'm shakin' so much, really yearnin'. 
Why don't you show up and make it alrig__ht-yeah? 
It's alright-right. 

And if you promised you'd love so completely 
An' you said you would always be true, 
You swore that you never would leave me baby, 
Whatever happened to you? 
An' you thought it was only in movies 
As you wish all your dreams would come true, hey. 
It ain't the first time believe me baby, 
I'm standin' here feelin' blu__e, blu__e-hah!. 
Yes I'm blue. 

Oh babe. 

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner, 
I watch the people go shufflin' downtown. 
A-nother ten minutes no longer 
An' then I'm turnin' around 'round. 
An' the clock on the wall's movin' slower, 
Oh my heart it sinks to the ground 
An' the storm that I thought would blow over 
Clouds the light of the love that I fou__nd, fou__nd. 

Light of the love that I found. 
Light of the love that I found. 
Oh that I found. 

Hey babe. 

Oooh__ hand that ticks on the clock 
Just don't seem to stop 
When I'm thinking it over. 

Oooh__ tired of the light, 
I just don't seem to find. 
Have you wait, yeah played. 

Whoah~oooh__ I see it in my dreams 
But I just don't seem to be with you, you 
I gotta get it all, gotta get it all, gotta get it all, I've got to get a__ll. 

Ooh now my body is starting to quiver 
An' the palms of my hands gettin' wet oh. 
I got no reason to doubt you baby, 
It's all a terrible mess. 
An' I'll run in the rain 'til I'm breathless, 
When I'm breathless I'll run 'til I drop, hey! 
An' the thoughts of a fool's scattered careless, 
I'm just a fool waitin' on the wrong blo__ck ohh-yeah. 

Hey now. Ohhh__-hoh~hohh. 
Light of the love that I found. 
Light of the love that I found. 
Light of the love that I... 
Light of the love that I found. 
Light of the hey now. Light of the hey now. 
Light of the love that I found. 
Light of the love that I found.---Lyrics submitted by joy.
