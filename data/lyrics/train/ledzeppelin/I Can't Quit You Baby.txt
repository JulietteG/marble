I can't quit you baby
So I'm gonna put you down for awhile.
I said I can't quit you baby
I guess I gotta put you down for awhile.
Said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child.
Yessir you did!

Said you know I love you baby
My love for you I could never hide.
Oh you know I love you baby
My love for you I could never hide.
Oh when I feel you near me little girl
I know you are my one desire.

When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby,
You know it hurts me deep down inside.
When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby,
You know it hurts me deep down inside.
Oh, when you hear me, honey, baby,
You know you're my one desire.
Yes, you are.---
