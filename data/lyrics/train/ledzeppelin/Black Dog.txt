Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move,
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.
Ah, ah, child, said the way you swing,
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting.
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way,
Watch your HEARTACHE drip, can't keep away.

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

I gotta roll, can't stand still,
Got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill,
Eyes that shine burning red,
Dreams of you all through my head.
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...

Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby,
Tell me what you do me now.
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby,
Tell me what u do me now

Didn't take too long b'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out.
Spent my money, took my car,
Started tellin' her friends she' goin' be a star. 
I don't know, but I've been told
A Big legged woman ain't got no soul

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, ah 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, ah

All I ask for, when I pray,
Steady rollin' of woman gonna come my way.
need a woman gonna hold my hand
tell me no lies, makes me a happy man.

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...

Ahhhhhh!
