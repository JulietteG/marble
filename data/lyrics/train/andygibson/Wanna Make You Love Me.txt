Old people make me cry
Goodbyes make me drink
Tom Petty makes me drive too fast
The Bible makes me think
Children make me laugh
My Momma makes me wanna treat a lady right
Like Daddy always has

You make me wanna buy a rose
You make me wanna shine my shoes
Baby, you make me wanna dance
Better than I do
You make me wanna be a man
Who makes you laugh and makes you cry
I wanna be everything you need
You make me wanna make you love me

Girl I'm not poetry
I'm not the finest wine
But I'll toast to you and me
And I'll try to make you rhyme
I'll learn your favorite song
Stand in the yard with my guitar
And sing outside your window all night long

You make me wanna buy a rose
You make me wanna shine my shoes
Baby, you make me wanna dance
Better than I do
You make me wanna be a man
Who makes you laugh and makes you cry
I wanna be everything you need
You make me wanna make you love me
Oh yeah

You make me wanna buy a ring
You make me wanna put you first
You make me wanna talk to God
Even when I'm not in Church
You make me wanna be a man
Who makes you laugh and makes you cry
I Wanna be everything you need
You make me wanna make you love me
Oh yeah

You make me wanna make you love me---
