(Farewell
Didnt mean to let you)

After all these wasted nights
I cant pretend that Im doing fine
Ive played it back a thousand times
But now I see it
And I realize

That the damage is done and its obvious
We can never go back to the way it was
Were drifting apart and its killing us
Its killing us

Farewell
Didnt mean to let you..

Let you down
Mess it up
We both knew we couldnt last forever
Its coming down
Ive had enough
I guess we crumbled under all the pressure
Did my best
For what its worth
And I gave you all this heart can give so

Farewell
I didnt mean to let you
Down (Down)

There was a time youd scream my name
It used to be my getaway
Now all we do is just complain
Maybe Im the one to blame

But the damage is done and its obvious
We can never go back to the way it was
Were drifting apart and its killing us
Its killing us

Farewell
Didnt mean to let you..

Let you down
Mess it up
We both knew we couldnt last forever
Its coming down
Ive had enough
I guess we crumbled under all the pressure
Did my best
For what its worth
And I gave you all this heart can give so

Farewell
I didnt mean to let you
Down (Down)

Its such
A shame
How did we end up this way
We cant go back
And things will never be the same
All hopes faded
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

Farewell
I didnt mean to let you..

Let you down
Mess it up
We both knew it couldnt last forever
Its coming down
Ive had enough
I guess we crumbled under all the pressure
Did my best
For what its worth
And I gave you all this heart can give, so

Farewell
Didnt mean to let you

Farewell
Didnt mean to let you
Down
Down
(Farewell)---
