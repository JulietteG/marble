I fall asleep by the telephone
It's 2 o'clock and I'm waiting up alone
Tell me, where have you been?
I found a note with another name
You blow a kiss
But it just don't  feel the same
'Cause I can feel that you're gone

Can't bite my tounge forever
While you try to play it cool
You can hide behind your stories
But don't make me for a fool

You can tell me that there's nobody else
(But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(But I see it)
You can look into my eyes
And pretend all you want
But I know
I know your love is just a lie
It's nothing but a lie

You look so innocent
But the guilt in your voice gives you away
Yeah, you know what I mean
How does it feel when you kiss
When you know that I trust you?
And do you think about me when he fucks you?
And could you be more obscene?

So don't you try to say you're sorry
Or try to make it right
And don't waste your breath
Because it's too late, it's too late

You can tell me that there's nobody else
(But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(But I see it)
You can look into my eyes
And pretend all you want
But I know
I know your love is just a lie,lie
It's nothing but a lie,lie
You're nothing but a lie

You can tell me that there's nobody else
(But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(But I see it)
You can look into my eyes
And pretend all you want
But I know
(But I know)
I know your love is just a lie
(But I know)
I know you're nothing but a lie,lie
You're nothing but a lie,lie
Your love is just a lie---Lyrics submitted by janette.
