Imagine me and you
I do
I think about you day and night
It's only right
to think about the girl you love
and hold her tight
So Happy Together!

[bridge]
If I should call you up
Invest a dime
and you say you belong to me 
and ease my mind
imagine how the world could be
so very fine
So Happy Together!

[chorus]
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
when you with me baby the skies will be blue
for all my life

Me and you
and you and me
no matter how they toss the dice
it has to be
the only one for me is you
and you for me
So Happy Together!


[bridge]
If I should call you up
Invest a dime
and you say you belong to me 
and ease my mind
imagine how the world could be
so very fine
So Happy Together!

[chorus]
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
when you with me baby the skies will be blue
for all my life

I can't see me loving nobody but you
for all my life
when your with me baby the skies will be blue
for all my life
for all my life

Call you up...
Ease my mind...
Ease my mind?
EASE MY MIND!!!!
