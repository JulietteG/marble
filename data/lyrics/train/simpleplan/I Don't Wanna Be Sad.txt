No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad sad sad no more

It's been 28 days since I've seen the sunshine
Cause I just can't seem to lift this cloud away
I swear all the tears I've cried could fill an ocean
I've been swimming in the sea of misery

I can't find the strength to leave this bed
I'm locked up in my cuckoo head
I feel so low and I can't let go
I've got all the symptoms, all the signs
I tell my friends I'll be just fine
But truth be told
It's getting old

No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad sad sad no more
(No, no, no)
And I know, some days will be bad
But I don't wanna be sad sad sad no more

I've tried every pill the doctor will prescribe me
(I've tried, oh, oh, oh)
And I've put myself through weeks of therapy
(Weeks of therapy)
I've tried meditation yoga and pilates
(I've tried, oh, oh, oh)
It's like happiness just wasn't meant for me
(Wasn't meant for me)

But I'm through I'm done I've had enough
I'll ditch this funk I tell you what
Just watch me now
Cause I won't back down
I've got a bad ass personality
So I just need to set it free
It starts today I'm on my way

No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad sad sad no more
(No, no, no)
And I know, some days will be bad
But I don't wanna be sad sad sad no more

(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, no, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, no, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, no, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad

No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more
And I know, some days will be bad
But I don't wanna be sad sad sad no more

No, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be sad sad sad no more
(No, no, no)
And I know, some days will be bad
But I don't wanna be sad sad sad no more

(No, no, no)
I don't wanna be
(No, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more
(No, no, no)
I don't wanna be
(No, no, no)
I don't wanna be sad, sad, sad no more---
