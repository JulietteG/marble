Here we are again
Awake at 5 AM
I didn't mean a word I said
Can we just pretend?
I can take it back
Change the way the story ends

I remember when
Things were simple then
Didn't always hurt this way
I would fall asleep
You would carry me
You would take my fears away

Am I messed up?
Forever flawed
Beyond repair
But forever yours

All my life
All I ever did was try and try
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child
I don't know why
Always found a way to make you cry
I never meant to be your problem child
Your problem child

When you look at me
I wonder if you see
All the things you thought I could be
Or all the crazy nights
All the stupid fights
All the tears that filled our eyes---
