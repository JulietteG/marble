I found your picture looking through a book
It was the one I took
When we were driving on Sunset
Descendents playing on a mix CD
That you just made for me
You wrote For when you miss me on it

I cant stop myself when I listen
I always sing along
Reliving every minute
And I just cant take it

I wish that I could forget you even exist
And find a way to, be without you
Cause I miss you and I hate feeling like this
Its making me sick
Feeling nostalgic
Every year when October comes around
And it gets colder out
I grab my favourite hoodie
Theres still a hole from when you borrowed it
You used to sleep in it
Cause it reminded you of me

Cant stop myself when Im thinking
I only see your face
Reliving every minute
And I just cant take it

Maybe someday my heart will be over it
Maybe someday Ill be ok
But I miss you and I hate feeling like this
Its making me sick
Feeling Nostalgic---
