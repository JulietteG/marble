Dear Sophia
I think Im better off without you

Like a Polaroid picture
I can still see you in mind
In your Def Leppard t-shirt
I said I was yours
You said you were mine

We started a fire
A fire like no one's ever seen before
There was something about you
There was something about you

But then you beat my heart up
Left it black and blue
Now I wish I never met you

Dear Sophia
I think I'm better off without you
I kinda miss ya
And making out all night like we used to
We were good together
But now the things you've done we can't undo
So don't write me back
P.S. I hate you

You can spare me the fake tears
We don't even need one last goodbye
I'll see you in ten years
Or maybe we should make that forty-five

We're done and it's over
And now the fairytale is up in flames
I hope it was worth it
Yeah I hope he was worth it

And if there's one thing in this life I know is true
Its that I wish I never met you

I hope one day you fall in love with someone new
And just when you think its true
He breaks your heart in two
Just like you did to me---
