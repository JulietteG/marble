He holds her in his arms
Would you? Would you?
He tells her of her charms
Would you? Would you?
They met as you and I 
and they were only friends
But before the story ends

He'll kiss her with a sigh
Would you? Would you?
And if the girl were I
Would you? Would you?
And would you dare to say
lets do the same as they
I would, would you?

And would you dare to say
lets do the same as they
I would, would you?---Lyrics submitted by jessie p.
