Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh

If home is where the heart is,
why do I feel so fucking heartless?

The crumbling skyline cuts a vicious horizon, 
sinking its teeth into the cold September sky.

Decaying towers of steel reach with crooked spires for the heavens, 
like bones of the hollow chest of this town, torn wide for the scavengers.

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Mother mercy, take my hand.

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Follow me through this forsaken land.

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Father time, return what's mine.
The innocence you stole from these eyes.

Because I just feel, I just feel numb

For the vision burning before me is one of former glory.
An icon cast in the light of freer times,
now writhes in a bed of lies.

Hope doesn't live here.
Love doesn't live here anymore.

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Mother mercy, take my hand.

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Follow me through this forsaken land.

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Father time, return what's mine.
The innocence you stole from these eyes.

Because I just feel, I just feel numb

I just feel numb,
I just feel numb,
I just feel numb!

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!
Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Mother mercy, take my hand.

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Follow me through this forsaken land.

Wo-ohh, Wo-ohh!

Father time, return what's mine.
The innocence you stole from these eyes.

Because I just feel, I just feel numb!(x3)---Lyrics submitted by Tone.
