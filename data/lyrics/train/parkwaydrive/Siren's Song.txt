Virtue is lost

Beyond this sleek veneer
Beneath the need of existence
The vicious scream
And everything she longs for turns to black
The giver calls sweet home, vindication,
And black waits for everything
Does she realise what she's become?

But she's not waking
And she's not feeling
But she's not waking
She's still feeling

Follow the siren's song,
To face this empty cycle.
Searching the darkest nights
Searching the silence

And does it make you sick?
Can you hear me as she touches?
Does it make you feel beautiful?
Bloodshed under the streetlight.

And does it make you sick?
Oh God! We got a bleeder here
Does it make you beautiful?
Heartbreak under the streetlight.

She's lost again.
Your dream are enslaved,
Corrupted, as a lathe.

Virtue is lost

Beyond this life in here
Beneath the need of existence
Her face is grey
And everything she longs for is pulling away

Follow the siren's song
To face this empty cycle.
Searching the darkest night
Searching the silence.

Follow the siren's song,
To face this empty cycle.
Searching the darkest night,
Searching the silence.

Dead by first light,
They can't wipe the blood from her eyes.
Dead by first light,
They can't wipe the blood from her eyes.

Dead by,
Dead by first light.
Dead by,
Dead by first light---Lyrics submitted by Joash.
