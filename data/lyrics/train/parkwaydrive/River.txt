Follow your heart to the water
Fill your pockets with stone
Throw your arms around me
Never let me go

You were the first, you wouldn't be the last
What the river took, we could never replace
And as the pain set in so did the realisation
You were never coming home
For nights we lay awake
Wishing for answers, hoping against all hope
And if love could change the course of fate
These nights, we move mountains
But as the news filtered down the line, the impact shook us
Shook us to the core
Loss struck like a dagger in our aching hearts

Follow your heart to the water
Fill your pockets with stone
Throw your arms around me
Never let me go

It's not the years in your life, it's the life in your years

Old soul, so it's said
The day we lost is the day I found regret
Now in the waters that embraced you
But in the wake your absence left

Sink into me

Hold out your hands, sink into me
Hold out your hands, I'll take you away
Hold out your hands, surrender the weight of this world

Follow your heart to the water
Fill your pockets with stone
Throw your arms around me
Never let me go

Never let me go---
