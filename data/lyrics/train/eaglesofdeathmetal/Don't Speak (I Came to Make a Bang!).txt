Don't move, don't speak, even whisper
There's something happenin' but don't be scared
I'm too smooth, you never see me coming
I'm never in a hurry, I'm just movin' fast

I said HAOW!
Oh yes you know I said HAOW!
I came to make a bang!
I said HAOW!
Yeah.
Yes I said HAOW!
I came to make a bang!

Pull me, I'm your fabulous weapon
I'll hit your target, girl, so you see
Well I'm in too tight, gonna feel it tonight, yeah
Baby here I stand, I'm your impossible man

I said HAOW!
Yes I said HAOW!
I came to make a bang!
I said HAOW!

Don't move, don't speak, even whisper
You have my weapon, girl, but don't be scared
I'm in too tight, gonna feel it tonight, yeah
Baby girl, gonna take your whole world
HAOW!
Yes I said HAOW!
I came to make a bang yeah!
