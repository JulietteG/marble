Well I come in through your window
I see your family there
Yes I'm the midnight creeper
When I go creepin y'all better beware
Well Your child is gently sleeping
Pleasant dreams are in his head
That wife of yours is a sweet young thing
When I leave your wife'll be dead
Well my steel is sharp and silent
The devil guides my hand
Well I just love to slit them throats
And creep all around this land---
