I'm gon' set my soul on fire.
My heart beats low while the flames go higher.
Strike the match and then the truth is told.
I'm gon' set my soul on fire.
The Devil made me a Woman!...
I ain't no liar.
Her eyes burn black like the lake of fire.
She struck the match and then I sold my soul...
For the black haired girl from the lake of fire.
My heart beats low while the flames go higher.
Strike the match and then the truth is told.
I just set my soul on fire---
