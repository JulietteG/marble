Angry words and empty silence
you on your side, me on mine
lying here in total darkness
that old cold spot marks the line

we've turn our backs on each other
feels we wasted so much time
I didn't mean to hurt you
somethings are better left unsaid

I can't sleep 
I can't stop thinking
it's going round-n-round my head
If I only stopped to listen
we'd be making love instead

[SOLO]

Angry words and empty silence
you on your side, me on mine
lying here in total darkness
that old cold spot marks the line

Why can't we atart all over and go back one step in time---Lyrics submitted by Mateus Herculan.
