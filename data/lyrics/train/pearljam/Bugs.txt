I got bugs, I got bugs in my room
Bugs in my bed, bugs in my ears
Their eggs in my head
Bugs in my pockets, bugs in my shoes
Bugs in the way I feel about you
Bugs on my window, tryin to get in
They dont go nowhere, waiting, waiting
Bugs on my ceiling, crowded the floor
Standing, sitting, kneeling, a few block the door
And now the questions
Do I kill them, become their friend 
Do I eat them, raw or well-done 
Do I trick them, I dont think they're that dumb
Do I join them, looks like thats the one
I got bugs on my skin, tickle my nausea
Ah I let it happen again, they're always taking over
Ah I see, they surround me, I see
See them deciding my fate, ah that which was once
Was once up to me, ah its too late
I got bugs in my room, one on one
Thats when I had a chance, I'll just stop now
I'll become naked, and what the fu..
I'll become one---Lyrics submitted by William.
