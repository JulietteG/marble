Consider me an object 
Put me in a vacuum 
Free of all conditions 
Free of air and friction 

Yeah, I'll be hanging upside down. 
And there I will swing 
For all eternity 

Fell it rising, yeah next stop falling 
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling 

Consider me an abscess 
Leave me in my vacuum 
Blood on all the pistons 
Running my transmission 

Feel it rising, yeah next stop falling 
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling 

Feel it rising, yeah next stop falling 
Feel It rising 

High above I'll break the law, 
if it's illegal to be in love, 
leave the hatred, on the cross 

yeah I'll be hanging upside down and here I will swing 
for all eternity 

feel it rising, yeah next stop falling 
feel it rising, comatose with no fear of falling 

feel it rising, yeah, next stop falling 
feel it rising 

something never thought you'd be part of---Lyrics submitted by Cheryl.
