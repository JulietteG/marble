I spent my life becoming invisible
Its hard to maintain and its hard to get by
I dont recall, fight or flight setting in
I had no introduction
I just breathe it in like the air

And theres nothing to remember
There is nothing to remember

I owe you nothing
Thats all Ive got for you
And youll borrow nothing
Thats what you expect of me
So you send me a love
Out of thin sailors knots
And I fear underneath the weight of your thoughts
My footsteps now they wont echo too loudly

All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
And Ill give you those

You told me something that scared me to death
Dont take me home
I cant face that yet
Im ashamed that Im barely human
And Im ashamed that I dont have a heart you can break
Im just action
And other times reaction

All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
And Ill give you those
Just dont make me go home

Give me something to remember
Give me something to remember
Give me something to remember ---Lyrics submitted by Ruby G Hooker.
