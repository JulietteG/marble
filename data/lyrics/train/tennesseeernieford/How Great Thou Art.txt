Oh Lord, My God
When I, in awesome wonder
Consider all the World, Thy hands have made

I see the stars
I hear the Rolling Thunder
Thy Power, throughout the Universe displayed

Then sings my Soul, my Saviour, God, to Thee
How Great Thou Art, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul, my saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, 
How great Thou art---Lyrics submitted by Kim Mckersie.
