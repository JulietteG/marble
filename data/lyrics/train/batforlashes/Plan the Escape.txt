Leave the wasting world behind us
We will make it out alive
Leave the waiting world behind us
We will not give up this time

Hold on to our reasons
And plan the escape
Hold on to our reasons
And plan the escape

Hold on to our reasons
And plan the escape
Hold on to our reasons
And plan the escape---
