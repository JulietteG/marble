The wind blows cool across my face
I can smell the taste--a trace of lace
There's something sinister in place
It leaves me restless with no peace
So it's a perfect day to fade... away.

It's a perfect day to turn away and run
It's a perfect day to go and tie one on
It's a perfect day to waste away a perfect part to play
Just another perfect day, but before you know, it's gone.

My mind slips further from what's real
Take my hands away from this steering wheel
I'm crashing, coming down in waves
I wipe the sweat from upon my face
So it's a perfect day to leave this place.

It's a perfect day to hide down in my hole
It's a perfect day, and it's taking it's toll
It's a perfect day to waste away your perfect part to play
Just another perfect day, but before you know, it's gone.

It's a perfect day to hide down in my hole
It's a perfect day, and it's taking it's toll
It's a perfect day to waste away your perfect part to play
Just another perfect day, but before you know, it's gone.---Lyrics submitted by Chad.
