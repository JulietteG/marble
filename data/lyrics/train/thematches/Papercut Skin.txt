Day out, day in, 
It's the alarm versus me and the snooze button wins.
I've been wakin,
All my life to become what I'm going to be I'm a crone,
A headstone.
Day out, day in and begin again...
Day out, day in, 
Recycle bins,
Cash out, cash in,
Debt pins,
Day out, day in,
The paper cuts my skin again, skin again.

[Skin again, skin again!]

Cash out, cash in,
I can burn all I earn on some weakness or whim.
Without thinkin,
I'm a mark for their marketing plans,
I'm americancer.
A myspace romancer.
Cash out, cash in and begin again...
Day out, day in,
Recycle bins,
Cash out, cash in,
Debit pins,
Day out, day in,
The paper cuts my skin again, skin again.
Day out, day in,
Vitamins.
Give out, give in,
Vicodins.
Day out, day in,
The paper cuts my skin again, skin again.
Skin again, skin again.

All ye, all ye come home free,
Olly olly oxen free,
Day in, day out,
I call time out.
All ye, all ye come home free,
Olly olly oxen free,
Day in, day out,
I call time out,
I call time out!

Give out, give in,
If a man's hands show his trade does it suit me then?
This papercut skin,
That makes me wince with every hand I'm required to,
Shake, shake, shake, shake...
Day out, day in, 
Recycle bins,
Cash out, cash in,
Debit pins,
Day out, day in,
The paper cuts my skin again, skin again.

Day out, day out,
Vitamins 
[Olly olly oxen free]
Give out, give in
Vicodin!
Day out, day in,
The paper cuts my skin again, skin again,
[Olly olley oxen free!]
Skin again, skin again.

I call time out!
Olly olly oxen free...---Lyrics submitted by Ariel.
