Do you belong to a song?
Does it drag you along by the tongue at the top of your lungs?
Are you drunk?
Have you been drinking?
Do you below the overpass go with a fifth in your fist
reminiscing the kiss of a love that just didn't love as much as you did?

Please don't give up, dear walls
don't let the ceiling fall
when you belong to a song, salty eyes,
You belong.

Shrill notes begin, the grim violin
then from the silence a violence of sirens orchestrate the score
to which one more corpse is left quiet
How we become the hollows of drums
the rests between notes, the hollers that never reach throats
"friends" in quotes, they're not calling

Please don't give up, dear you
I'm but the sliver moon sliding through
when you belong to a song, salty eyes,
You belong.

Do please believe, however naive
let it drag you along by the tongue at the top of your lungs
and belong, salty eyes

When you belong to a song, salty eyes,
You belong.---Lyrics submitted by amanda.
