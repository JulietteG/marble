I'm just a dog-eared page you turn back to.
Where's the place for me
When we're both in love with you?

I can't escape these friends
I've made since you left town.
They throw redundant parties
Where I'm too often found.
And while I sit and watch girls and boys
Trade views of new tattoos,
I wonder if it's too late to call your mom
And catch up on some news.
She says you'll be home soon for me

And it'll be just like you were never gone.
I'll try to be just some guy you're getting on.
But basically, we're both in love with you.
I'm just a dog-eared page you turn back to.
Where's the place for me,
When we're both in love with you?

I've got these "friends" in quotes
And girls* with asterisks.
I watch the time wither
And fall from my wrist.
Out on the porch Van Morrison
Is bleeding through the walls.
I don't think your roommate
Has been writing down my calls.
She says you'll be home soon for me

You said the distance
Would make a difference,
But it didn't.---Lyrics submitted by Phoebe.
