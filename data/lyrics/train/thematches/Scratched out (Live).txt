wake up and waste a day
chase away
a day at a time
and waste away
clean-faced today
clean taste today
toothpaste makes my orange juice sour
waste an hour
or so
my shower
is slow
the flowers
that grow
outside of my window
are blooming
I'm assuming
that you're comin' over soon
it's almost half past four
and you called here at noon
'cause there's a picture that you wanna see
now I'm not even good at being me
anymore.

She got nicotine-basted lungs
wasted thumbs
and one of them asphalt tastin' tongues
she wakes up to alarm
her make-up is still on
and she can't remember why she set the damn thing
her heart is a machine
art is meant to be seen
not felt, not heard
it's just paint they're just words
and fingers are for feeling
fists are for beating
scabs are for healing
and blood is for bleeding
that's just how I used to be
but I'm not even good at being me
anymore.

I wake up and waste an hour
pace and glower
at the TV set wasting power
and aching in my head
I'm banking in the red
and compulsively charging cd's to my account
So come out Virginia*
Don't make me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
now it's too late in the day
for a matinee
and I ain't got the money to pay
for you anyway
what should I say?
I know it ain't how it used to be
but I'm not good at being me
anymore.---
