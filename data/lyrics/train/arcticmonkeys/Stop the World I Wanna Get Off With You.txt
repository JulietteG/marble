[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
Open Sesame. (We've places to go)
We've people to see. (Let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes, that I bet you can make...
When you want to escape say the word.

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do.
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room,
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth.
Get the sense that you're on the move,
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you.

[Chorus]
Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you.
Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you.

[Verse 2: Alex Turner]
Eyes the colour of, (Water left in ?)
Ice and sugar dust. (Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing, that I cannot explain,
Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Alex Turner]
Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do.
And I don't wanna lie, and I don't wanna tell you the truth.
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see.
Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree.

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
