You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And youre kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

[Chorus]
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know whos calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

[Verse 2]
Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was acting like I knew
Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winters in full swing and your dreams just arent coming true
Aint it funny what youll do

[Chorus]
The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didnt approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

[Bridge]
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could Be My Baby
[X4]

[Chorus]
(All the zeros lined up but the numbers blocked when youve come undone)
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know whos calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
