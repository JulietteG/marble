These hammers and strings
Been following me around
From a box filled garage
To the dark punk rock clubs of one thousand American towns

And my friend calls me up
She says how have you been
I say, dear, I've been well
Yea the money's comin
But I miss you like hell
I still hear you in this old piano, yeah

She says Andy, I know
We don't talk as much
But I still hear your ghost in these old punk rock clubs
C'mon write me a song
Give me something to trust
Just promise you won't let it be just the keys that you touch...

Give me something to believe in
A breath from the breathing
So write it down,
I don't think that I'll close my eyes
Cause lately I'm not dreaming
So whats' the point in sleeping?
It's just that at night
I've got nowhere to hide
So I'll write you a lullaby
A lullaby

These hammers and strings 
Been following me around
Behind passenger vans
Through the snow dirt and the sand
Of one thousand American towns

And my friend calls me up 
With her heart heavy still
She says Andy the doctors prescribed me the pills
But I know I'm not crazy,
I just lost my will
So why am I, why am I
Taking them still...?

I need something to believe in
A breath from the breathing
So write it down,
I don't think that I'll close my eyes
Cause lately I'm not dreaming
So what's the point in sleeping?
To the sleepless this is my reply
I will write you a lullaby
A lullaby

Give me something to believe in
So write it down 
I don't think that I'll close my eyes
Cause lately I'm not dreaming
So what's the point in sleeping
It's just that at night
I've got nowhere to hide
To the sleepless this is my reply
I will write you a lullaby
A lullaby
A lullaby
A lullaby---Lyrics submitted by Courtenay.
