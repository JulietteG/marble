Finally, i'm letting go of all my downer thoughts
And no time there'll be one less sad robot
Looking for a chance to be something more than just metal
Now i'm going part time with a film projectionist
And shes the vinyl queen from the surfer dream
She loves the beach boys more then radio metal
Shes so good, but shes no good for me

Miss Delaney, whats the matter
Your waiting by the window, waiting by the window
Waiting by the door
Miss Delaney, wheres your boyfriend
He isn't up in heaven so why treat him like hes... dead, like hes...

Its not that everyday, everyday is coming up with the green grass
But the times pass when i think of you whenever i'm at dinner

Finally, i found someone to dole this lonely scene
I don't spend our nights searchin' for earthquakes
So its biblical how my... sleep can be
But she won't sleep with me

Miss Delaney, whats the matter
Your waiting by the window, waiting by the window
Waiting by the door, ahh
Oh, Miss Delaney, wheres your boyfriend
No he isn't up in heaven so why treat him like hes... dead, like hes dead
Like hes dead

From here you can't find everything, never i would never lie to you...
Miss Delaney, Miss Delaney, whatcha sad for?
Well you waited by the window that i was kicking down your door, ahow
Miss Delaney, wheres your boyfriend, wheres your boyfriend?
He isn't up in heaven so why treat him like hes... dead
Oh Miss Delaney... ohho---Lyrics submitted by Jake.
