And today was a day just like any other. 

I'm on the verge, I'm on the the verge
Unraveling with every word
With every word you say make me believe
That I wont feel your tires on the street
As I'm finding the words, you're getting away

I come undone, oh yes I do
Just think of all the thoughts wasted on you
And every word you say, say something sweet
Cuz all i taste is blood between my teeth
As I'm finding the words, you're getting away

Well, I'm Ready
I'm ready to drop
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
I'm ready, I'm ready so don't stop, I'm ready so don't stop
Keep pushing
I'm ready to fall
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm ready, I'm ready so don't call, I'm ready so don't call

I am aware I've been mislead
I disconnect my heart, my head
Don't wanna recognize when things go bad
The things that you'll accept, 
Except that I am finding the words to say

I'm ready
I'm ready to drop
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Im ready, Im ready so dont stop, Im ready so dont stop

I wake up to find its another four aspirin morning and I dive in.
I put on the same clothes I wore yesterday. 
When did society decide that we have to change and wash a t-shirt after every individual use?
If its not dirty, I'm gonna wear it. 
I take the stairs to the car and theres fog on the windows. 

(I'm finding the words)

I need caffeine in the bloodstream. I take caffeine to the bloodstream. 
I grip the wheel, and all at once I  realize. 

(And you're getting away) 

My life has become a boring pop song and everyone is singing along. 

Well, I'm ready to drop
Well, I'm ready 
I'm ready so dont stop
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, keep pushing
I'm ready to fall
Well, I'm ready (Don't stop me,I'm ready, don't stop me) 
 I'm ready so dont call, Im ready so dont call
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Dont stop me,im ready, dont stop me, I'm ready)
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by Cecilia.
