I called Jesus but he didn't check his phone today,
Oh oh, there's my summer girl
I've been wanting her
I hear she's got a boyfriend
Thought I could leave her for a season but it just got cold
Yeah, it's a lonely hour in my cellphone tower,
Broken down transmission.

But I'm gonna take you to my boxcar on the beach
And I'm gonna hang the sun above your bed
And soak your hair in bleach

You'll be missed Miss California
You'll be kissed by only me
When they can't find you you'll turn into a mystery
but you're no mystery to me, Miss California

I called Jesus but he heard I hurt his little girl, yeah,
with my reckless stare, I've been so unfair
Misplacing my affections
She had a reason not to take me back into her care
Oh, I'm just a stray dog now, I can't beg or bow
Just give me some direction.

And I'm gonna take you to the mansion where I hide
and I'm gonna paint a diamond on your hand
And you will be my bride
You'll be missed Miss California
You'll be kissed by only me
When they can't find you you'll turn into a mystery
But you're no mystery to me, Miss California
Miss California
I'll be around, I'll be around.

You'll be missed Miss California.
You'll be kissed by only me.
When they can't find you you'll turn into a mystery
But not to me.

You'll be missed Miss California
We'll be married in the rain
When they can't find you I'm sure I'll be the one they blame
But they can't prove anything
Miss California
Miss California
I'll be around---Lyrics submitted by Devin.
