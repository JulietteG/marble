You gotta swim
Swim for your life
Swim for the music
That saves you when you're not so sure you'll survive
You gotta swim
And swim when it hurts
The whole world is watching 
You haven't come this far to fall off the earth
The currents will pull you
Away from your love 
Just keep your head above

[Chorus]
I found a tidal wave 
Begging to tear down the dawn
Memories like bullets 
They fire at me from a gun
Crack in the armor, yeah
I swim for brighter days despite the absence of sun
Choking on salt water
I'm not giving in
I swim
[Chorus End]

You gotta swim 
Through nights that won't end
Swim for your families
Your lovers, your sisters
And brothers and friends
Yeah, you gotta swim
Through wars without cause
Swim for the lost politicians
Who don't see their greed as a flaw
The currents will pull us
Away from our love
Just keep your head above

[Chorus, leave off last line then repeat last two lines]


You gotta swim 
Swim in the dark
There's no shame in driftin'
Feel the tide shiftin'
And wait for the spark
Yeah, you gotta swim 
Don't let yourself sink
Just find the horizon
I promise you it's not as far as you think
And the currents will drag us
Away from our love

Just keep your head above
Just keep your head above
Swim
[to fade]
Just keep your head above
Swim, Swim
Just keep your head above
Swim---Lyrics submitted by Kairei.
