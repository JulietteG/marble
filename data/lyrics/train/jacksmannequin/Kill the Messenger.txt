Oh my god this hurts like hell
I had that dream again where I was lost for good in outer space
Tell the doctor how to shake
Awake a nightmare that is only worse
When I am sleeping

Kill the messenger, 
I swear it's not me it's just someone I used to know
And get to church cause you're a good girl
And I never told you that
And all I need from you 
Could be the thing that leaves us both up here forever
I'm gonna send the rain your way
I'm gonna send the rain

It's not so easy caving in
I walked by your apartment twice today
While you were gone at work
And all the colors got so dim
It's not as cold out here 
But come quick I am losing feeling

Kill the messenger, 
I swear it's not me it's just someone I used to know
And get to church cause you're a good girl
And I never told you that
And all I need from you 
Could be the thing that leaves you locked up here forever
I'm gonna send the rain your way
I'm gonna send the rain, send the rain
I'm gonna send the

Rain to pour down on you
The rain that makes the flowers bloom
Rain to leave you all alone
But keeps eyelashes falling
Your wishes washed away

Kill the messenger, 
I swear it's not me it's just someone I used to know
And get to church cause you're a good girl
And he never told you that
And all I need from you 
Could be the thing that leaves us both up here forever
I'm gonna send the rain your way
I'm gonna send the rain
Send the rain
I'm gonna send the rain
I'm gonna send the rain your way
I'm gonna send the rain
I'm gonna send the rain---Lyrics submitted by Courtenay.
