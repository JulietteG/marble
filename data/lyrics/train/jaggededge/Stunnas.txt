[Chorus]
Stunna shades,
Fluid in my cup,
We up in da club,
We gon tear it up [2x]
Stunnaz on
Stunnaz on
Stunaaz on
Stunnaz on, got my stunnaz on [2x]

[Verse 1]
Now middle of the day grippin 12 0 clock at night
You'll neva catch me without my stunnaz on
I be on dat green I be cheifen mean forgot my visine
But I got my stunnaz on they dont wanna let me in da club wit em on
Say im lookin like a thug wit em on (wit em on)
I take em off I get in and put em right back on
You'll neva catch yo boy without his stunnaz on

[Chorus]
Big whips or rocks we gon get em
Loose lips aint leavin out now we wit em
Any top notch dyme in ya city we wit em
Dont stop late night till da morn keep da stunnaz on
If its fresh or flashy yes we wit it
Got kicks so quick da first to go get it
Before u approach dat dyme prolly already hit it
Dont waist time steady on my grind wit ma stunnaz on

[Verse 2]
Now we sailin in da mall homie ice got it all
Know I b doin it wit my stunnaz on
Catch me on da ave hand up on da dash
Hands b turnin so fast who's dat wit dem stunnaz on
My eyes tinted got a lean in da lac
Let a nigga look g in da lac
I'm a boss deez cost runnin to bring I know
Told ya neva catch yo boy without his stunnaz on

[Chorus]
Like this big whips or rocks we gon get em
Loose lips aint leavin out now we wit em
Any top notch dyme in ya city we wit em
Dont stop late night till da morn keep da stunnaz on

Got kicks so quick da first to go get it
Before u approach dat dyme prolly already hit it
Dont waist time steady on my grind wit ma stunnaz on

[JD]
I got my stunnaz on cardier made
Wood grain frame wit my name in da shades
And when I wanna switch it up I put dem garda d's on
Same stunnaz wood gon now dey all chrome
I read in em beat in em eat in em
Shorty say she love it so she let a niggaz beat in em
Its a important part of my attire apart of my fresh
I cant leave home witout em like my american express
Im 4rm da a where its mandatory gotta ride some
Hit da mall mann erry'day buy some
Da bigger da better da harder to stunt
He aint doin it like me baby tell em stop frontin

[Chorus]
Like this big whips or rocks we gon get em
Loose lips aint leavin out now we wit em
Any top notch dyme in ya city we wit em
Dont stop late night till da morn keep da stunnaz on
If its fresh or flashy yes we wit it
Got kicks so quick da first to go get it
Before u approachh dat dyme prolly already hit it
Dont waist time steady on my grind wit ma stunnaz on

[Jagged Edge]
Soon as we walk in watch yo chick
Cuz you know yo chick iz gonna watch me
Bet she gonna like what she see
Cuz I always got my stunnaz on [2x]
Stunnaz on

Stunnaz on
Stunnaz on, got my stunnaz on [2x]---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
