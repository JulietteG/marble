No, I'm done cheating
No, I'm done creeping
Tryina get it out of my life
Time to give me some right
And I know some gon' be mad
And some keep gon' be sad
But they will be alright,
I think I'm gon' find my wife
I won't be the one who's fifty and alone
I'm gon' have my family by my side
Till I'm dead and gone
It's about to say alright, alright, alright
Alright,alright, alright, alright
I'm so ready to start this life

Girl, I never thought I'd say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I think I'm not trippin' when I say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I'm ready to be in love
Think, I'm think I'm ready to feel your love
Think, I'm think I'm ready to be in love
Think, I'm think I'm ready to be in love

Girl, I know that I've mislead you
My compliment gon' beat it
I can't go back and change things that were
Baby starting here and today
I'm gon' change it all the ways
I'm racing fast forward to your lo-lo-love
And I won't gon' be the one who's miserable and alone
I won't be the one who, I won't be the one who
And I can't say our life is what you wanted so
Never thought I'd hear the words out of my mouth

Girl, I never thought I'd say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I think I'm not trippin' when I say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I'm ready to ring you up
Think, I'm think I'm ready to feel your love
Think, I'm think I'm ready to be in love
Think, I'm think I'm ready to be in love

When I said yes, I mean for real
Now the first time in my life, could be you
She raised the best out of me
Baby, she the reason for this
It's only 'cause this

I'm ready to be in love
I'm ready to be in love
I'm so ready
I'm ready, ready ready
I'm ready to be in love

Girl, I never thought I'd say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I think I'm not trippin' when I say this
I think I'm ready to be in love
I'm ready to ring you up
Think, I'm think I'm ready to feel your love
Think, I'm think I'm ready to be in love
Think, I'm think I'm ready to be in love---
