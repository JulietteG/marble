Hugh Prestwood

We kissed goodnight 
And we turned out the lights
And lay side by side in the dark
And were waiting for sleep or a spark
But the nights on the run
And the spark does not come
And we quietly worry and wonder
And the silence is louder than thunder
And it rings with the sound of goodbye

It rings with the sound of goodbye
I cant even tell you just why
It may be the truth or it may be a lie
But it sounds like the sound of goodbye

We can talk of the weather
We can talk of the news
We can talk of the talk of the town
Theres another true love going down
We can talk about promises 
Talk about lies
But theres no use in pointing our fingers
And the sound of I love you still lingers
And it rings with the sound of goodbye

It rings with the sound of goodbye
I cant even tell you just why
It may be the truth and it may be a lie
But it sounds like the sound of goodbye

Time is forever and love is a fire
And one day its one degree colder
As the clocks ticking over your shoulder
And it ticksand it ticks
And it ticksand it tick
And it ticks with the sound of goodbye
I cant even tell you just why
It may be the truth and it may be a lie
But it sounds like the sound of goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
