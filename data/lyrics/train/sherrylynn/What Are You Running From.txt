You say youre an island 
I think that you just might be
Cause your missing out on so much
 its like youre lost at sea

You say you dont need no one
 dont want no one needing you
Its all just a waste of your time 
but its just an excuse

Only love can break a heart and only love can make it better
When you think your gonna fall apart
 its the only thing that keeps you together
You can try and go and live without it 
dodge your way around it But while your running
 your gonna fall right in so what are you running from

you say you dont need no one
 dont want no one needing you
its all just a waste of your time
 but its just an excuse oh you know its not true

Only love can break a heart and only love can make it better
When you think your gonna fall apart
 its the only thing that keeps you together
You can try and go and live without it 
dodge your way around it But while your running
 your gonna fall right in so what are you running from

It could be just around the corner 
or she could be staring you right in the face yeah 

you try to go and live without it 
dodge your way around it
 but while youre running
 youre gonna fall right in
so what are you running from

what are you running from---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Klein.
