You come walking in here 
Like a runaway train
You better cool that engine down
Cause Ive been there done that
And baby youre no where bound
Back from the west coast
Wheres your pot of gold
Baby was it worth the cost
Now you want to start picking up
Where you left off
(Chorus)
You better stop what youre doing
Boy keep on moving
Whatever youre thinking 
Youre wasting your time
Dont bother waiting
Pull out of this station
Cause I aint going your way
Im on the right track
And baby youre the wrong train (Ooh Ooh Baby youre the Wrong Train)

You said you had friends in LA
You were only gonna stay awhile
Well I guess those California girls
Were more your style
Now youre coming at me
With a full head of steam 
Blowing dust across the floor
Well you must be dreaming
Cause I aint climbing aboard

(Chorus)
(Bridge)
ooh oohTheres nothing left to say
ooh oohIm a bridge that you burned
Oh no I dont need another heartache
Youre one lesson Ive already learned
(Breakdown chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
