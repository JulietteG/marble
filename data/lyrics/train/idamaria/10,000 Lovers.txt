I know cause you said so
you're loving lovely Lola
and kissing cutie Katie
and sexing sexy Sadie
i won't get in between ya
I'm not gonna Jolene ya now
And I know the deal
when you pull the curtains down
That's the sign we agreed 
for me to get out of town
But the northern winds are blowing hard
while someone's blowing you

Home sweet home ain't sweet anymore
Since I started sleeping on your bathroom floor
ten thousand lovers and I'm one

So I went to Debaser
to watch Tegan and Sarah
but they played so early
and I don't feel like dancing
and I don't feel like drinking
but I'm getting kind of hungry
The girl that served the pizza
she said she also did ya
the girl in line behind me
said you've been behind her
I'm working hard to find
a place in this town
that you've never been


Home sweet home ain't sweet anymore
Since I started sleeping on your bathroom floor
with ten thousand lovers and I'm one

Boy, you can't treat me like that!

(Norwegian)

Home sweet home ain't sweet anymore
Since I started sleeping on your bathroom floor
with ten thousand lovers and I'm one---Lyrics submitted by elzofia.
