I cant hide, no I cant keep quiet
Its like my hearts on fire and
I cant get over it, cant get control of it
Its not your typical love its a miracle,
You stepped into my world
And You gotta hold me,
Now You wont let go of me
Ive got a feeling that I cant explain
Like Im crawling out of my skin
Dead till the moment that You said my name
Now my heart is beating again

Youre making me new
Making me new,
Everything new
Ive been changed by you
Like only love can do
Youre making me new

No warning signs, no sirens or flashing lights
And just like a thief at night,
you so unexpectedly showed up and rescued me
I got a feeling that I cant explain
Like Im crawling out of my skin
I was dead till the moment that you said my name
Now my heart is beating again

You gave it all for me, came and set me free
Now your love has overcome ---
