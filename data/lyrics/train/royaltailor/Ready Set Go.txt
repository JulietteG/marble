Live so long with my eyes on me
Too deaf to hear, too blind to see
Oh, broken hearts on the city streets but
I can hear that youre calling me to
Be the hope, be the light, be the love
Right now, starting right now

Oh, you put my life in motion, your love
Makes me wanna give my all
Ready set go
Ready set go oh
So no Im not coming back anymore
Like an engine ready to explode
Im ready set go
Ready set go oh, oh

Cant stop this clock keeps counting down
Down Down!
So many lost waiting to be found oh yeah
I will go where you're leading me now
Push my hands to the least of these now
Be the hope, be the light, be the love
Right now, starting right now

Oh, you put my life in motion, your love
Makes me wanna give my all
Ready set go
Ready set go oh
So no Im not coming back anymore
Like an engine ready to explode
Im ready set go
Ready set go oh, oh

Give me the green light
Show me the finish line
No more spinning in circles
No more wasting time
So ladies start today where I put the switch in stake
Yu're my life all go fight I'll go wherever you say
To the top of the highest mountain
To the bottom of every valley
I'll be spark that turns into the great finale
This love is something everyone needs to know
No more stalling, It's just ready set go

Broken hearts on the city streets but
I can hear that youre calling me to
Be the hope, be the light, be the love
Right now, starting right now

Oh, you put my life in motion, your love
Makes me wanna give my all
Ready set go
Ready set go oh
So no Im not coming back anymore
Like an engine ready to explode
Im ready set go
Ready set go oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
