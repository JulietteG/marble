Two steps beyond the edge
I cant undo this leap of faith
Takes my breath away
So high above the ground
Youve got me hanging in mid air
Between here and there
Now all I have is You

(Chorus)
Im not afraid
I know Im safe
Its a chance but my choice is made
Im not alone
You wont let go
And I know through it all
You hold me in the freefall

If I just believe my eyes
Id see I should be terrified
But Im so alive
I dont know how or when
But I believe that Youll come through
Lord, Im trusting You
Cant wait to see what You will do

Im falling, Im falling, Im falling

You got me falling from the sky with no parachute
Thinking I can fly but I know its You
Got me up here, no fear, no tears
Minds clear cause I know Youre here
Cant wait to see what You will do---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
