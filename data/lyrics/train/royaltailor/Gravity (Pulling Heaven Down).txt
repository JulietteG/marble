Whats love without a heart that it can teach
Whats war without a causeWhats hope without humanity in need
Whats a win without a loss
I know, I know we ight against gravity
But gravitys no enemy
Yes, I know, I know we fight against gravity
But gravity is what we need

(Chorus)
Its pulling Heaven down, down, down
Its pulling Heaven down, down, down
How could it be the gravity that holds me to the ground
Is pulling Heaven down, down, down

Whats free if theres no chains to be found
Whats death without a cost
Whats truth if we keep it out of reach
Whos Christ without a cross
I know, I know we fight against gravity
But gravitys no enemy
No, I know, I know we fight against gravity
But gravity is what we need

Gravity found us a Savior
Put Him on Earth so He could save us
No love, no force is greater
Heaven meets Earth, thats the gravity of love

Pulling Heaven down so look up theres a change in the wind
A revolution is about to begin, love wins
Yeah, Im talking about a holy visitation
For God to come and visit, this nations patiently waiting
For Him to move like He said He would move
Ready for God to do anything that He wants to
The time is now to pull, if you ask me, Im not afraid of gravity Its pulling Heaven down---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
