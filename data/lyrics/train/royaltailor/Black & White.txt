Yes, you've been on my mind
I've been drifting for quite sometime and
This life is paralyzing
This life is paralyzing me
I can't see through the grays
Truth has been lost in the haze and
I need someone to save me

Truths all I want, all I want is you
You're all I want, all I want
All I want

Cause there's black and there's white
And there's wrong and there's right
I can't go one more night
Without tellin you that I am sorry
For all the pain that I caused
I've been gone for so long
But I'm tellin you that I am sorry
Can you hear me?
Please forgive me!

I'm sreamin through the noise
Tell me you can hear my voices 
I am so lost without you
I am so lost without you here
I need some clarity
Need your spirit leading me
My visions getting bleary

Truths all I want, all I want is you
Oh, truths all I want, all I want
All I want

Cause there's black and there's white
And there's wrong and there's right
I can't go one more night
Without tellin you that I am sorry
For all the pain that I caused
I've been gone for so long
But I'm tellin you that I am sorry
Can you hear me?
Please forgive me!
Ooooh

I've been locked in this maze for so long
Show me the way back home
Open my eyes to see you!
Whoa!
Oh!

Lada dada. Dada!
Lada dada. Dada!
Lada dada. Dada!
Dadada Dada!

Ooooh! ooh ooh ooh oh!

Truths all I want, all I want is you, yeah
Truths all I want, all I want
All I want!

There's black and there's white
And there's wrong and there's right
I can't go one more night
Without tellin you that I am sorry
For all the pain that I caused
I've been gone for so long
But I'm tellin you that I am sorry
Can you hear me?
Please forgive me!
Forgive me!

Yes, you've been on my mind
I've been drifting for quite sometime and
This life is paralyzing
This life is paralyzing me.---
