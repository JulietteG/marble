I was just walking home
IPod and my headphones on
Thinking bout who I wanna be
TV, magazines and the billboards
All say I'd be cool if I had more
But that's a lie I must ignore

(Chorus)
This world just keeps on trying
But it aint satisfying
This hunger in my soul
Cause they dont even know
That my identity
Is more than what they see
Its in the One who came to set me free
So I can be who I wannabe

Gotta friend lives down the road
Livin' life like a TV show
But his big ol' house is not a home (nah nah nah nah)
Gotta Benz, got friends but he's not sure
Would they be there if he was poor
Thats not the life I'm looking for---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
