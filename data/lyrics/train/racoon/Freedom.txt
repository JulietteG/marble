You got me thinking
I'm really thinking
Don't want a palace, just a roof
You tend to melt, I'm waterproof

You got me thinking
I'm merely thinking
You wanna drop, make sure you bounce
You need a little don't take an ounce

The book we're living in
I read it twice
And I don't want the plot to change

Although it's beautiful
And you are lovely
Still I'll be damned if I let you take my

Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom

You got me thinking
Yeah, I'm merely thinking
You wanna grow, you'll have learn
To put it out, it has to burn

How am I gonna tell you stuff
That I don't know myself
You need a minute, don't take an hour
I'll drink the milk, but not when it's sour

This book we're living in
I've read it twice
And I don't want the plot to change

Although it's beautiful
And you are lovely
Still I'll be damned if I let you take my

Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom

This book we're living in
I've read it twice
And I don't want the plot to change

Although it's beautiful
And you are lovely
Still I'll be damned if I let you take my

Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
