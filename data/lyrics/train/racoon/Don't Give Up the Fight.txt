Please don't give up the fight
For no reason, but your own
I never said that the fight would be easy
Because it won't

I will remember you, and all that we have been through
There is no angel, that can be more angel than you
I see you every night when your star is shining bright
And I smile, I cry, I wish you where here, with me

Well, I am so proud to be your father
I am so proud to be your mum
And I am so proud to be your brother
So may this be your song

Please don't give up the fight
For no reason, but your own
Cause I never said that the fight would be easy
Because it won't

I will come look for you
When this life is through
With this body
Before now I still need to life
For we are not alone
And you are not alone
We're at home, loving and waiting
And so afraid

Well I am so proud to be your father
So proud to be your mum,
And I'll always be proud to be your brother
So may this be your song
Please don't give up the fight for no reason
Please don't give up the fight for no reason---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
