Time flies and it seems to me,
the older ones get the history
I'll walk anywhere I like, 
thanks for the fight,
how kind of you bye bye
She said, I know where you will be tomorrow
I said, well that's quite bizar,
'cause I don't know where i'll go

So tell me wher I'll be, in 2014
The fields or maybe down in the canteen
living that dream, yeah
living that dream

Young girls and they seem to me much older 
then their given age, you see
There's less that meets the eye the spirit's gone, 
feel free to live,
'n bye bye

So tell me where I'll be, in 2014
The fields or maybe down in the canteen
living that dream, yeah
living that dream

So tell me where I'll be, in 2014
The fields or maybe down in the canteen
living that dream, yeah
living that dream---Lyrics submitted by Manoah.
