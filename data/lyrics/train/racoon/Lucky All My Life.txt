She calls and sais you'd stuff your letters
Yeah, you can sweet talk all you like
But pretty words don't make it better 
you let the fire burn all night, yes all night

The front door was open, I left my keys in.
I guess I've been lucky all my life.
Now she's so fed up with my easyness
I won't get any tonight, no
Woeeeh

I don't know why I gave my love away
sure don't know why you took the bate
maybe the balance leaned towards loving
a bit more than it did to hating me.

I apologize for everything
for all the times I've done you wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
but i gathered all my dreams around you
where you've put them with your own,
where they belong

Ok, ok, ok my lovely
I'll always look for another way to say, to say, to say 
you're lovely
i'll always look for a better way to say,
that I love you anyway,
O, I love you anyway

So I say
Ok, ok, ok my lovely
I'll always look for another way to say, to say, to say 
you're lovely
i'll always look for a better ways to say,
that I love you anyway,
I love you anyway---Lyrics submitted by Manoah.
