One party to call. Two people. one falls
No mermory at all. Just a waiting list
Some yelling, some tall
Some quiet, some small
They nibble on, well, anyone. No can do for you doll

Took a hit, a good hit, Like a car into the wall
What a hit, a real hit, when I thought I'd seen it all
Took a hit, a good hit, Let the dealer make the call
Oh man I thought I'd seen it all

You throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, It's not about you or me
throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, because the good life, the good love, the good bits are for free

Some ladies out there, nobody that seems to care
No beauty queens, out there. Just a waiting list
Thick stare straight through the room, we all give away the goods too soon
And we're waiting for something to say, instead of listening
Took a hit, a good hit, like a car into the wall
Oh man I thought I'd seen it all

You throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, It's not about you or me
throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, because the good life, the good love, the good bits are for free

Oh, that's what all good love should be

Took a hit, a good hit, like a car into the wall
Oh man I thought I'd seen it all

You throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, It's not about you or me
throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, because the good love, the good life, the good bits are..

The recipe, forget about you and me.
Throw out the recipe, It's not about you and me
Throw out the recipe, forget about you and me
You throw out the recipe, because the good love, the good life, the good bits are for free---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
