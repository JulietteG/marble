Uncovered ancient longing
Ancestors of my shame
Dissension hanging on its name

Established by the elders
Endangered by the youth
Preserved at any cost or truth

They gather round their campfire
I shiver in my cave

With the fear of the tribe
With the fear of the tribe
And an instinct to survive
With the fear of the tribe

This worlds the only thing
This worlds the only thing
This worlds the only thing it fights

Fell into deeper waters
Swam through a darker tide
This worlds the enemy it fights

Theyll build another campfire
Ill find another cave

With the fear of the tribe
With the fear of the tribe
And an instinct to survive
With the fear of the tribe

This worlds the only thing
This worlds the only thing
This worlds the only thing it fights---Lyrics submitted by Mark Breitinger.
