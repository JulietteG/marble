Chorus

----- brain cells bust, lyrics react
I think about the days when there was no contract
I used to hop the train cuz i had no dough
Playing beats on the chairs and let the discards flow?
Mom said everydays like this
When the baby face asks can I get payed for this?
But anyway, Im, by the time I was a toddler
A kid that understood me was a ..............
Back to .... for the dues I paid
The only one with out shoes in the whole 6th grade
Staring out the window, broke like Mr. ......
And nobody knows the troubles that I went through
My mama said lifes a double headed knife
If you stab you get stabbed
Cuz either your paid or you pay the price
So people listen when I start to flow
But im that same baby face from a while ago
So yo, remember we, remember this, remember us son
Paid in the shade...............................................
Thanks to those thats down i never diss
But would you be down if i wasnt on your guest list?

Chorus

Do you remember how it was when we were not who we are
When people didnt think that we would get this far
I never really thought about being a star
But if you phat, you phat, so you are who ya are
Back in the past, I used to be .....
But now whos the ....... kissing my......
Girls never kissed me
Always tried to diss me
But now its like the whole world is hangin wit me
But still I maintain my focus
And watch where im headed
Cuz truth must be spread and lies must get bedded
So open your eyes, cuz were the same old guys
But now i got more friends then world has flies
And the I (eye) do not understand what is the reason for the treasonal behavior
Save that nonsense for later
It seems you have forgotten that the original being that your seeing
Was not always MC'n
I used to get rejected,
Neglected and dejected,
Disrespected,
Treated like I was infected
But straight from black-alack comes the acrobat
And you were sayin i would never get phat, remember dat?
