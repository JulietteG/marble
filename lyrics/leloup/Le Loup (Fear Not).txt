All the howling animals
Whose bloody calls still in the air
The subtle sways of cackling rhythm
And snapping jaws that hold the stares

Birds of prey that mark the sky
Silver star, that chief of night
Whose pecking feathers swallow light
And razor talons terrorize

Through the darkness, through the night
How you've loved this heavenly host
Oh you ghost-like grieving wolves
Are you lost and lonely souls?

Birds of prey that mark the night
Silver stars above my eyes
Pointed skyward, scrape the heavens
And razor talons terrorize---Lyrics submitted by Madison Kruse.
