[Verse 1]
I'll take care of you
Don't be sad, don't be blue
I'll never break your heart in two
I'll take care of you

[Verse 2]
I'll kiss your tears away
I'll end your lonely days
All that i'm really try'in to say
Is I'll take care of you

[Refrain]
I want you to know that I love you so
I'm proud to tell the world you're mine
I said it before, I'll say it once more
You'll be in my heart 'til the end of time

[Verse 3]
I'll take care of you
Don't be sad, don't be blue
Just count on me your whole life through
Cause i'll take care of you......

[repeat]

I want you to know that I love you so
I'm proud to tell the world you're mine
I said it before, I'll say it once more
You'll be in my heart 'til the end of time

I'll take care of you
Don't be sad, don't be blue
Just count on me your whole life through
Cause i'll take care of you......---Lyrics submitted by Carl Adrian Aquiler.
