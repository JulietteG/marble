You don't have to tell me that it's over
For lately I can see it in your eyes
And I'll be gone when you wake up this morning
'Cause darling, I'm no good at goodbyes.

I know we had the good things while it lasted
It's sad to see a good love when it dies
But the teardrops only make it hard for leaving
And darling, I'm no good at goodbyes.

Although it breaks my heart to write this letter
I know someday that you will realize
That when it hurts so much this way is better
And darling, I'm no good at goodbyes.

Oh darling, I'm no good at goodbyes... ---Lyrics submitted by Fay.
