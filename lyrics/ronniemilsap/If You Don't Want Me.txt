Don't
Tempt me with your eyes
Or fill my heart with lies
If u don't really want me to
And say, say what's on your mind 
Just give me some kind of sign 
To let me know what I'm supposed to do

(chorus)
Cuz if you don't want me to
Then tell me
It's too easy loving you 
Like it should me 
If you don't want me to
don't tease me, don't tease me
Try to please me

The way, the way you say good night
Makes me want to stay each time
Girl you know I'm really wanting you
Marry-Go-Round
You get me so high off the ground
Now don't you go and let me down 
Girl you don't know what I'm going through
I'm sooo all over you

So if you don't want me to
Then tell me
It's too easy loving you 
Like it should be 
If you don't want me to
Don't tease me, don't tease me
Try to please me

If you don't want me to (if you don't want me to
Then tell me
It's too easy loving you 
Like it should be
If you don't want me to (if you don't want me to
Don't tease me, don't tease me
Try to please me

If you don't want me to (if you don't want me to
Just tell me
It's so easy loving you 
Like it should be 
Tell me what I should do (if you don't want me 
Don't tease me, don't tease me
Try to please me

If you don't want me to (if you don't want me to
Just tell me
It's so easy loving you 
Like it should be
Tell me what I should do (if you don't want me to
Don't tease me, don't tease me
Try to please me---Lyrics submitted by Dale.
