Long time ago and once upon a time
we were roaming the hills to reach for the sky
Nothing has changed, though everything is different
Maybe just the ways to get high
A sweet voice on the radio talked
about life at the bottom of the sea
Sure it was scary, sure it was stifling
sure it was lonely, sure it was cold
Then all at once the storm is subsiding
I'm coming up now, quiet but bold
A sweet voice on the radio talked
about life at the bottom of the sea
Good thing for me, you finally found me,
found me while I was still alive
These things were meant to be remembered
These things were meant to be told
These things were meant to be remembered
These things were meant to never grow old
Long time ago and once upon a time
we were roaming the hills to reach for the sky
Nothing has changed, though everything is different
Maybe just the ways to get high
A sweet voice on the radio talked
about life at the bottom of the sea
Good thing for me, you finally found me,
found me while I was still alive---Lyrics submitted by silvia.
