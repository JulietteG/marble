(Yeah)
(Come on)

Like a parade we march ourselves in one by one
Like the infection, that bleeds out inside of us
Locked in a cage but you can take the beast
We've gotten sick of structure
Call the doctor for us...
Somebody get me out
Before I burn this bitch down

Tonight, tonight you know ill save you
Tonight, tonight ill bring you back (yeah)
Tonight, tonight you know ill save you
Tonight, tonight ill bring you back
Im gonna let this bitch burn

I'm not a slave, I won't be guided to a grave in
A masquerade, you'll hide your face
You got it out for me
Like strangers in the night
Holding close their sharpened knives
I've had it, it's dramatic so I'm running away...
Somebody get me out
Before I burn this bitch down

Tonight, tonight you know ill save you
Tonight, tonight ill bring you back (yeah)
Tonight, tonight you know ill save you
Tonight, tonight ill bring you back
Im gonna let this bitch burn

Someone drag me from this nightmare
I can barely stand it
Somebody get me out
Before I burn this, burn this, burn this down

Tonight, tonight you know ill save you
Tonight, tonight ill bring you back (yeah)
Tonight, tonight you know ill save you
Tonight, tonight ill bring you back (yeah)

Before the sun returns
I'm gonna let it burn
Before the sun returns
I'm gonna let this bitch burn
Before the sun returns
I'm gonna let this bitch burn ---
