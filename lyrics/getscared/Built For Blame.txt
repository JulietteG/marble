Eyes can only see what they want,
When they're open minded to the thought
Of getting hurt again. Beaten to the bone
With the thought of all you worst events
You said just look (just look) don't touch

Oh you think you know
It's exactly what you want for love, love
Your heart without a key is just a lock to bleed
This wreck you've made is all you'll need

This is what it takes to breathe
(We're getting up again)
This is what it takes to fake a smile and say
That everything's OK
As long as i take blame

Picture perfect down the drain again and again
I'm really tired of these
Stupid little people knocking you to the ground
You would've never found 
The mess you made
I hope it's worth all the shame

We sit inside our heads
'Cause this is such a curse
We sit inside out heads cause nothing ever works
Nothing ever works

'Cause what if this doesn't work 
We sit inside our heads
This is such a curse
And it never ever works

This is what it takes to breathe...
This is what it takes to fake a smile and say
That everything's okay
As long as i take blame

This is what it takes to breathe
(We're getting up again)
This is what it takes to fake a smile and say
That everything's okay
As long as i take blaamee.....

(Guess I'm the one to blame)---Lyrics submitted by Kenzy Allen.
