I'm so nervous it shake the fingertips that are coursing through your hair.
With those lovely lips that are made to kiss oh you put me in a spin.
You've got a body of a goddess
You've got the moves that make me sweat
You've got a voice that makes me breathless.

Girl I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out.
I've got you!
If this is heaven then baby I don't want to know hell.

She says my singing gets her thinking filthy,
The thoughts she's thinking I know I'm not worthy.
I know what I need to sweep her off her feet
She knows the work will damn near kill me.

Girl I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out.
I've got you!
If this is heaven then baby I don't want to know hell.

Girl I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out.
I've got you!
If this is heaven then baby I don't want to know hell.

She can't resist me,
She's just what I need,
She makes me so weak 
At my knees, at my knees

She can't resist me,
She's just what I need,
She makes me so weak 
At my knees, at my knees

Girl I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out.
I've got you under a spell

Girl I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out.
I've got you!
If this is heaven then baby I don't want to know hell.

Girl I've got you
Under a spell and I don't think I'll be letting you out.
I've got you!
If this is heaven then baby I don't want to know hell.

Baby I don't want to know hell.
If this is heaven then baby I don't want to know hell.---Lyrics submitted by Aryona VanSchuyver.
