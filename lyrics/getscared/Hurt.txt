Oh, yeah, oh yeah

How do you sleep through the night
Where do you go when you hide
Waiting for the truth to call
I don't fear you anymore

How do you think I'm alright
It's the way I wait
It's the way you've changed

And I like the way you hurt inside
Always waiting for the worst, to get me by
And I like the way you hurt
Does it really come
Does it really come as a surprise

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

From all the years that went by
You held your chin up, survived
You would have thought I had died
But I made it out alive

How do you sleep through the night
It's the lies you gave
[- From :http://www.elyrics.net/read/g/get-scared-lyrics/hurt-lyrics.html -]
Now the rules have changed

And I like the way you hurt inside
Always waiting for the worst, to get me by
And I like the way you hurt
Does it really come
Does it really come as a surprise

It's no surprise
It's no surprise

It's the lies you gave
Now the rules have changed

And I like the way you hurt inside
Always waiting for the worst, to get me by
And I like the way you hurt
After all you've done, look what I've become
And I like the way you hurt inside
Always waiting for the worst, to get me by
And I like the way you hurt
Does it really come
It doesn't really come as a surprise---Lyrics submitted by jennifer w.
