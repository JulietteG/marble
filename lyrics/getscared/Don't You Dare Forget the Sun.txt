You're a mess, tangled with your confidence.
 You think you haven't sinned.
 Well, you're unstoppable,
 Your walls are impassible.

Oh, I think you're better off looking alone,
 'Cause the boys that chase your hips can just go find their way home.
 And at the end of the day you think to yourself,
 "My body is a product being sold on a shelf."
 Tell me I can change,
 Tell me I can change.

I know you lay in bed,
 Contemplating your own death.
 Well, just look at what you've done.
 Don't you dare forget the sun, love!

(Don't forget!)

Cold white walls, keep you from your pad and pen.
 You just wanna stab again.
 I can't believe it's half this hard,
 You never knew your mind was dark, no!

Well, I think you're better off looking alone,
 'Cause the boys that chase your hips can just go find their way home.
 You can dig so deep for scars,
 You never knew your mind was dark.
 Come on and breathe with me, oh!
 Breathe with me, oh!

Well, I know you lay in bed,
 Contemplating your own death.
 Well, just look at what you've done.
 Don't you dare forget the sun, love!

You look down on, me so casually,
 In everything I know.
 You look down on me, but not right on me.
 Did I wreck this broken home?

Dear diary,
 Life is trying me.
 Can I get a sign?
 Or a two of mine, a piece of mind.
 Can I get a sign? (a sign)
 Can I get a sign? (I know)

Well, I know you lay in bed,
 Contemplating your own death.
 Well, just look at what you've done.
 Don't you dare forget the sun, love!

You look down on, me so casually,
 In everything I know.
 You look down on me, but not right on me.
 Is it plain to see, that life is trying me?
 Ohh, life is trying me!
 Life is trying.

Can I think of something?
 Gotta think of something!---Lyrics submitted by Jessica B.
