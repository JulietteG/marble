I gots a lot to learn, 
But I learn a lot, I'm not concerned.
You've got a lot of burns
From all this pessimisy you said
Miscommunication.
Miss, you've got me waiting.
And I'm shaaa sh-sh-shaking
Emotions, dislocated.

Fake apologies (Fake apologies)
Can I just call it quits, 
I can't take all of this.
Fighting all of me (Fighting all of me)
I want a second chance, 
But I'm so broken.

(Hahahaha)

I'm growing madder by the day, 
It doesn't matter anyway.
Over dramatic and insane
But you look at me so differently, 
Oh, me specifically.
'Cause I've got all these little things
Laugh at me, tragedy.

Fake apologies (Fake apologies)
Can I just call it quits
I can't take all of this.
Fighting all of me (Fighting all of me)
I want a second chance, 
But I'm so broken.

Yeah, I would give up everything to know, 
Just for a fact it won't come back.
And I would give up everything to know, 
Just for a fact it won't come back.

So much more.
So much more.
So much mooore! 

Fake apologies (Fake apologies)
Can I just call it quits, 
I can't take all of this
Fighting all of me (Fighting all of me)
I want a second chance, 
But I'm so broken
[X2]

And I've got a lot to learn, 
But it's okay I'm not concerned, 
Nooo.
Okay, I'm concerned!---Lyrics submitted by Kenzy Allen.
