Oh baby stick em up
Your love or your life
A sweet kiss from poison lips
Wanted dead or alive
Seemed so clear now a mystery
Knew it from the start
Revenge is Sweet and worth the pain
And I'm aiming for your heart

Oh Oh OH

Bang Bang Bang
How's it feel now?
Should've never let me go, no na na no no no
Bang Bang Bang
Bet you know now you're never gonna hurt me
No no na na no no more
Bang Bang Chicka
Bang Bang Bang

Accused of sticky fingers
A prisoner for life
Tell me babe who's got the gun?
I'm aiming with one eye
Not a single trace of evidence
Nothing left behind
Bullet wounds and a broken heart
Make for a perfect crime

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Bang Bang Bang
How's it feel now?
Should've never let me go, no na na no no no
Bang Bang Bang
Bet you know now you're never gonna hurt me
No no na na no no more
Bang Bang Chicka
Bang Bang Bang

And that pistol to the heart
To you it was such a surprise
Oh, I caught you so off guard
Now here's just a taste
Of the tears I've cried
Oh I've cried

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Bang Bang Bang
How's it feel now?
Should've never let me go, no na na no no no
Bang Bang Bang
Bet you know now you're never gonna hurt me
No no na na no no more
Bang Bang Chicka
Bang Bang Bang

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Bang Bang Bang
How's it feel now?
Should've never let me go, no na na no no no
Bang Bang Bang
Bet you know now you're never gonna hurt me
No no na na no no more
Bang Bang Chicka
