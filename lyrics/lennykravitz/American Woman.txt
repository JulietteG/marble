Huh, American woman, stay away from me 
American woman, mama let me be 

Don't come hanging 'round my door 
I don't wanna see your face no more 
I got more important things to do 
Than spend my time growin' old with you 

Now woman, stay away 
American woman, listen what I say 

American woman, get away from me 
American woman, mama let me be 

Don't come knocking 'round my door 
I don't wanna see your shadow no more 
Colored lights can hypnotize 
Sparkle someone else's eyes 

Now woman, get away 
American woman, listen what I say 

American woman, I said, get away 
American woman, listen what I say 

Don't come hanging 'round my door 
Don't want to see your face no more 
I don't need your war machines 
I don't need your ghetto scenes 

Colored lights can hypnotize 
Sparkle someone else's eyes 

Now woman, get away 
American woman, listen what I say 

American woman, stay away from me 
American woman, mama let me be 

I gotta go, I gotta get away 
Baby, I gotta go, I wanna fly away 

I'm gonna leave you, woman 
I'm gonna leave you, woman 
I'm gonna leave you, woman 
I'm gonna leave you, woman 

A-bye, bye, a-bye, bye 
Bye bye, bye bye 

You're no good for me and I'm no good for you 
(American woman) 
I look you right straight in the eye an' tell you what I'm gonna do 

I'm gonna leave you woman, you know I gotta go 
(American woman) 
I'm gonna leave you woman, I gotta go 

I gotta go, I gotta go American woman, yeah---
