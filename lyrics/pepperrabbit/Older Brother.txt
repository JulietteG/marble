We both sat on our beds in our rooms
and we talked about what was coming soon

All the pink powder won't cover up what we did
doing wrong when we were just kids

And I think that your the older brother
that I never had

I wish I could reach out and touch you
don't worry I'm not sad

I know your just where you need to be
and everyone's a hundred grand

So save some space for me
and say hello to your dad

Ooo-oo-o-oo-oOoo-oo-o-oo-o...

I will after your sister I swear
I'll write her whens shes lonely
and send it off in the air

I will keep her safe until I'm dead
she'll always have a place to rest her head

you don't have to worry about it now
you don't have to live with that frown

I will keep your memory close to my chest
though I wish you hadn't said it was best

Could you have stayed just one more night?
for all of us to say goodbye?

But now all of your troubles are now gone
and you still feel so damn warm

Ooo-oo-o-oo-oOoo-oo-o-oo-o...---Lyrics submitted by Emery Butler.
