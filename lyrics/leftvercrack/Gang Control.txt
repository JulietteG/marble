Fuckin' pigs Fuckin' pigs
Were against the fucking pigs
Stab them with some dirty rigs
bury them under dirt and twigs
Gotta hate that gang of fuckin' pigs!

I'm being haunted by pailface in blue, 
and these cracker spooks are haunting you too
With municipal shovels their out digging our graves
under threat of reprisal, we abide to be enslaved

Policia Policia; why can't you see 
your bullits will never passify me
I don't fight the world, the world fights me
cause the gang in contol is the fucking PD

Thats right!

Fuck the police they're gang control
We gotta take it back
Everyone get up and lets go

Your politics are politi-kill
I'll take the bullit to prove that you kill
You front the facade of a "righteous man"
But the hole in your heart put a gun in your hand

Protecting the money and absolving the state
Crushing the people with the laws they create
Nothing forgotten and nobody saved
You can not break me, force me to behave.
(all right!)x3


Fuck the police they're gang control 
We gotta tear it down 
Everyone get up and lets go
Around the globe, it's in our heads
From the states out to Iran
Across the ocean, back again
England, Zaire and Japan

Fuck the police they're gang control
We gotta tear it down
Everyone get up and lets go
Individuals who hate man
With kings license to clean the land

Fill the already one way laws
Around the world they'll soon control us all!---Lyrics submitted by Lola.
