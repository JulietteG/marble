Tell me why there so much pain today
Cause taking lives is for the gain or so they say
I cant believe it but they feel this way
And thats the way of the world
Tell me why it takes a tragedy to see
To wake us up and bring us down on to our knees
With all the people suffering with diseases

And that the way
Thats the way
Thats the way of the world

As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better everyday
As the sun burns the ground
Theres got to be another way
Is our god looking down
And does it feel everybodys pain
As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better every day

Teach the children what means to love
Show them why we can never give enough
Lets work together we can rise above

And change the ways
Change the ways
Change the ways of the world

As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better everyday
As the sky turns the ground
There's got to be another way
Is our god looking down
And does it feel every bodys pain
As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better every day

(Heaven)

As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better everyday
As the sun burns the ground
There's got to be another way
Is our god looking down
And does it feel every bodys pain
As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better every day 

As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better everyday
As the sky turns the ground
There's got to be another way
Is our god looking down
And does it feel every bodys pain
As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better every day
