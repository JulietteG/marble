Verse 

Who's the one that makes you happy
Or maybe
Who's the one always on your mind
And who is the reason you're living for
Who's the reason for your smile

Chorus

I feel so lonely and I know Im not the only one
To ever feel this way
I love you so much
That I think I'm going insane
Gone crazy, out of my head, gone crazy, out of my head
Can't think about nothin but the good good love
What you give

Verse

Everyone needs somebody
And you know
Everybody needs someone
Well and yes its true
Everybody needs a special kind of love
And you're the only one I'm thinking of
You mean the world to me
You are my only

Chorus

I feel so lonely and I know I'm not the only one
To carry on this way
I love you so much
I lose track of time
Lose track of the days
I'm goin out of my head, gone crazy, out of my head
Can't think about nothin but the good good love
What you give

Its not what you got but its what your give
It aint the life you chose.
Its the life you live
Its only what you give
What you give
What you give
Its not what you got but its what you give

Its the life you live
Its the life you live

(Instrumental)

You're the one that makes me happy
Oh yeah baby
And youre the one always on my mind
Yes its true

You are my reason
My one and only
That I've been living for

Why cant forever be, forever and nothing more

Chorus

I feel so lonely and I know I'm not the only one
To ever feel this way
I love you so much
That I lose track of time
Lose track of the times

Gone out of my head
Gone crazy
Out of my head

Cant think about nothing but the
good sweet love

Its not what you got
Its what you give
It aint the life you chose
Its the life you live

Its not what you got
Its what you give
It aint the life you chose
Its the life you live

Its not what you got
Its what you give
It aint the life you chose
Its the life you live

What you give
What you give
What you give
What you give

Its not what you got
But its what you give

Only what you give
Only what you give

Its only what you give
Only what you give---Lyrics submitted by Joseph.
