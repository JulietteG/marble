Oooh hooo
ooooh hhoooo

shoo doo doo yes
shoo doo doo yes

It's gone beyond infatuation
I could be a victim of the picture 
going way back in time

I don't know why he leaves me all alone
waiting by the telephone just for your love
your call

I'm tired of being all alone 
wondering if you're coming home
I guess it 
I guess it doesn't need my love

Oh don't you waste my time
won't you read between the lines
so often you leave me lost in love

I need someone that I can touch
I need someone that I can feel
I need someone to hold me tight
oh baby yeah

I need someone who's always there
when I have something I to share
I need Love babe

I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need someone (someone) 
to love me right

babe
I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need some good love all night

when I wake up in the morning
and I reach for you you're not there
should I just lay back and cry
don't know what he's really thinking of
blinded by the picture of a 
perfect love that's all

I'm tired of waiting all alone
one day baby I'll be gone
so tell me what you wanna do

If the love for one didn't mean so much
there are things that we should touch
so boy don't you waste my time

I I I need someone that I can touch
I need someone that I can feel
I need someone to hold me tight
oh yes all night

I need someone who's always there
when I have something to share
I need Love 

oh baby oh baby no no 

I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need someone (someone) 
that will love me right
Oh yeah yeah

I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need your love
I wanna love, I wanna love
treat me right

I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need Oh I need someone (someone someone) 
someone to last all night
Plenty, plenty love

I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need If you only would
stop on by

you'll be the loser in the long run
and I'll pray for you
that you will find your way 
someday (find your way)

I just can't take the pain
I just can't take the chance to be alone
just don't, just don't wanna be alone
Not now

I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need someone
don't wanna be alone
don't wanna be at home

I need your love
I need, I need, I need
plenty, plenty love
I need your love

I want to be in love
I need to be in love
someone to hold me tight

I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need someone
ooo I wanna wake up in your arms baby

I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need your love
someone to hold me tight
ooooo plenty plenty love

I need, I need, I need
I need, I need, I need
I need
If you only would 
stop on by---Lyrics submitted by Michael Miller.
