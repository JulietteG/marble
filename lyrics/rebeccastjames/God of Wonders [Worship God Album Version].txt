lord of all creation
of water earth and sky
the heavens are your tabernacle  
glory to the lord on high 

God of wonders beyond our galaxy 
you are holy holy 
the universe declares 
your majesty 
you are holy holy

lord of heaven and earth 
lord of heaven and earth 

early in the morning 
I will celebrate the light 
and as I stumble in 
the darkness 
I will call your name by now 

halleluiah to the 
lord of heaven and earth 
halleluiah to the
lord of heaven and earth 
halleluiah to the 
lord of heaven and earth---Lyrics submitted by Barbara.
