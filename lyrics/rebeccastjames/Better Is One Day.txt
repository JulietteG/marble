How lovely is Your dwelling place
Oh, Lord Almighty
For my soul longs and even faints for You

For here my heart is satisfied
Within Your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings

CHORUS:
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

One thing I ask and I would seek
To see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells

One thing I ask and I would seek
To see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere


My heart and flesh cry out
For you, the living God
Your Spirit's water to my soul

I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You, I will draw near to You


Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

Than thousands elsewhere---Lyrics submitted by Bob.
