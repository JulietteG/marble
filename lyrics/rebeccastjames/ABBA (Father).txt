I fell like the eagle that rises
Flies above the earth and it's troubles
Oh yes he knows there are valleys below
But under his wings there's a stronger power
Oh Father- you are my strength
On You I wait upon

Chorus:
You make the road rise up to meet me
You make the sun shine warm upon my face
The wind is at my back & the rain falls soft
God I lift You high- You are my Abba

Running in this race to the finish line
The only road for me is the narrow
Not gonna stop or even look to the side
When I fix my eyes on You Jesus
Oh Father (Abba)- You are my strength
Now more than ever

Repeat Chorus

When you've run too far- and the road is long
Can't walk another mile- He is waiting
Hope in Him again- He'll renew you
Then you will rise, gather up your wings and fly...

Repeat Chorus

Do you not know?
Have you not heard?
He gives strength to the weary
To those who hope in Him
They will soar like the eagle---Lyrics submitted by Bob.
