Baby will you be my corona and lime, and I will be your main squeeze. And if your brother don't like my style, we can take it to the streets, wee can take it to the streets.

{Verse 1}

Yo. Lil Girls in the city, dress up pretty, go out and get messed up and shitty. Lil girls  by the see, dress like hippies, write love beads and go skinny dippin. Girls in the hills go day trippin to get their nails done and hair straighten. Lil girls in the 818  get hot when I role  over laurel canyon.

Let me tell you 'bout a girl i know she likes hip-hop and rock n' roll she walks slow down the avenue and I ain't met her but I'll get her when I do. Let me tell you about a girl I love , she stay at home 'cause she hate the club, baby butt, pretty little features I ain't met her but i'll get her when I see her.

{BACK TO MAIN}

{Verse 2}

Girls in New York look like giraffes, long neck, long legs. tiny tits and ass. Girls from L.A. rock over sized shades and chill all day 'cause they already payed. Girls in miami, street bikinis bump techno by D.J. Tiesto. Girls from Detriot like electro and dance all night till they break they neck yo.

{BACK TO BRIDGE}

{BACK TO MAIN 2x}

Now if your lookin for love wont you put your hands up 
if your lookin for love then im lookin for love 
(2x)
and this is what im lookin for

(back to bridge)

{back to main)

Baby will you be my corona and lime and i will be your sandy beach, and if your brother dont like my style we can take it to the streets, we can take it to the streets
