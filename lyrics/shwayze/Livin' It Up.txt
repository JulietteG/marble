(Snoop Dogg)
I know you gonn' hate on this

(Shwayze)
Ayo what's up y'all
No matter what it is you try to do
There's always gonna be somebody tryin to hate on you
But that don't stop what we do

Livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!

Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up
And I ain't even paid for this drink in my cup
Yeah, yeah, that's whassup
I'm the shit so light some matches up

Came a long way from 'Bucks
Servin' lattes all day in my chucks (Can I help you?)
A little green on my break for lunch
Got me thinkin' bout ways to get outta the rough

I ain't paid but I made enough
For haters to hate and try to call my bluff
Well here it is, my sophomore slump
And don't be mad when you're girl turn it up

Livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!

Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it good
And you just hate cause you wishin' you could (oh!)
It's my time to shine
Everywhere I go free Corona and lime (haha)

Came a long way from MySpace
Now girls wanna shoot at my place
Damn, ___ put a smile on my face
So all the haters; thanks for watching!

I ain't paid but I made enough
For haters to hate and try to call my bluff
Well here it is, my sophomore slump
And don't be mad when you're girl turn it up
Turn it up, turn turn it up
Don't be mad when you're girl turn it up

Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I

(Snoop Dogg)
Psychadelic colors on the Range Rover door
Like can a young nigga get money any more?
I got a game of chips fresh off a score
Just copped a new coupe off the Mercedes floor


World wide nigga makin' paper off tour
I don't wash shit I just change in the store
You can hate nigga, I got to get more
So watch me live it up, I got to give it up

Livin it up!
You got to hate on what's great
But that don't stop what we do!

Livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I, I'm livin' it up!
Why you hatin'? I'm livin' it up!
I, I, I

Ayy! Ohhh! Ayyy! Ohhh! Ayyy! Ohhh! Ay!! Ohh!
AYY!---Lyrics submitted by Lily.
