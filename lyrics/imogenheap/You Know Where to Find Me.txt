You know where to find me
When you're on your way up
Or bustle and busy
Enough is enough

'Cause life's sweet assemblages
are quick to driftwood away
Be still with me

You know where to find me
For no particular reason
For stop traffic behaviour
Or to get something off your chest

'Cause we go a long way back
Back to nothing at all
Be still with me

Oh, woah, woah, won't you be,
Be still with me.

You know where to find me
If you think it's all over
I can sense it a mile off
It's no friendly hello.

You could be screaming drunk,
Well I've got my bad days too,
I'm gonna be here for you,
Be still with me.

In a public space, private thoughts
A reminder of a precious loss
I could be a source of constant reassurance
Let the breeze block sadness drop

Oh, woah, woah, won't you be
Be still with me.

Woah X8
Be still...

Heart, lung, soul
Arteries and all
A shoulder at the ready
Vital organs on call

Heart, lung, soul
Arteries and all
A shoulder at the ready
Vital organs on call

Don't mistake my charity
for what it is
A deep need to be needed: necessary

Don't mistake my open arms
for what they are
They can turn on you
so show me the money, show me the money

Blue and green
Fresh eyes on me
I'm young again
All things to men

With bite size life boats
I'll fix your smashed up head

Be still with me
If you want to be alone
If you'd rather die than tell
You know where I'll be
Where to find me

For hard talk, to call it off
Or bring it on
A proposal
If you're broken, I'll be here

I'll be here
For your secrets
For a breather
There's nothing you can do...---
