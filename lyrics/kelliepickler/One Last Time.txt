I want to lay in your bed
Stare in your eyes 
Feel your heart beating with mine
One last time
One last time

There won't be any tears
That's not why I'm here
Baby turn out the lights and let's disappear
One last time 
One last time

Cause I'm not here to fight
About who's wrong or right
I just want your kiss
I wanna feel just like this
One last time 
One last time

Your breath on my neck
I don't wanna forget
The smell of your skin
Touch me again
One last time

Cause I'm not here to fight
About who's wrong or right
I just want your kiss
I wanna feel just like this
One last time
One last time

Then when you fall asleep
I'll kiss your cheek
Whisper goodbye
Then I'll just leave
One last time---Lyrics submitted by SheriMichelle.
