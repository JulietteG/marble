Boy there's a few things you need to know about me
Before you let your sweet heart get in too deep
A white picket fence don't feel like home
Don't wanna rock I need a rolling stone
You wanna hold me,
Baby just set me free

(Chorus)
I'm a traveling circus train
Spinning weathervane
Going where the wind blows (yeah)
I was born to chase the sun
Some horses gotta run
Yeah I'm always gonna be,
A little bit gypsy

Someday, hey, maybe I'll settle down
But it sure ain't anytime close to now
So much that I might miss you
Sit still for a single minute
I got a life and I'm going to live it
The only way I know how

(Chorus)

I don't know where I'm headed to
I just know I wanna go with you
Do you want to go too?

(Chorus)
