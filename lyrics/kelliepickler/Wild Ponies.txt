She was a beautiful girl, she was wild as the wind
On top of the world 'til she fell in love with him
Now everyone told her that he was bad news
A boy goin' nowhere ain't no good for you

Cause wild ponies are born to run
Don't you know wild ponies don't belong to no one
So baby run, run, run away

The first time he hit her was right after church
He said he was sorry but only got worse
Now she's not the same girl that she used to be
He's breakin' her spirit, he's fencin' her dreams

But wild ponies are born to run
Don't you know wild ponies don't belong to no one
So baby run, run, run away

She went out for groceries just an ordinary day
She realized she was just a block from the interstate
She sat at the stop light, the wheel in her hands
And when the light changed she knew this was her chance

Wild ponies are born to run
Don't you know wild ponies don't belong to no one
So baby run, run, run away
Baby run, run, run away---Lyrics submitted by Audrea.
