Everything single day is the same old thing
Wake up every morning do the same routine
Paint my nails and get my hair to curl
Lord it's hard being a girl
I love getting all dressed up to the nines
But sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys

Somethin' bout old blue jeans and baseball cap
Fellas I get it and I admit it
It just don't get any better than that
Chicken wings, NASCAR, and football Monday nights
Sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys

I like tp put my hair up in a ponytail
Climb up in a pick up and raise some hell
Have a four-wheelin' mind boggling real good time
Then go home and play poker all might long
I still love chick flicks and a real good cry
But sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys

Somethin' bout old blue jeans and a baseball cap
Fellas I get it and admit it
It just don't get better than that
Chicken wings, NASCAR, and football Monday nights
Sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys

Somethin' bout old blue jeans and a baseball cap
Fellas I get it and I admit it
It just don't get better than this
Chicken wings, NASCAR, and football Monday nights
Sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys
Sometimes it's fun to be one of the guys---Lyrics submitted by christine.
