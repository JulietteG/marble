Someone somewhere tonight
Is taking their first steps
Letting go of the hands that held them
And trusting themselves
An somewhere somewhere tonight
Is hearing their last rites
And prayin with all their might
That theres something else.

So, baby, lie down here beside me
Lets lie real still
An tell me you love me
And you always will.

Someone somewhere tonight
Is tasting their first kiss
Whispring softly this wish
For this night to go on
While someone somewhere
Is holdin on to a bottle
Pourin one more an hopin that God will
Get them through till the dawn.

So, baby, lie down here beside me
An lets lie real still
An tell me you love me
And you always will, (yeah.)

Someone somewhere tonight
Is stuck in a prison
Breathin but just barely livin
Behind walls of their own
Ooh, an someone somewhere tonight
Just found their own wings
An found some beauty, an found some meaning
(They found some truth.)
Found some truth in spite of it all.

So, baby, lie down here beside me
An lets lie real still
An tell me you love me
And you always will.

And you always will---
