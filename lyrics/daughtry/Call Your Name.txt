You never said, you never said, you never said
That it would be this hard
Love is meant to be forever 
Now or never seems to discard
There's gotta be a better way for me to say whats on heart
Without leaving scars so can you hear me?
When I call your name?

And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow.
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?
When I call your name

Complicated situations are the makings of all that's wrong
And I've been standing in the river of deliverance way too long.
There's gotta be a better way for me to say whats on my heart
Without leaving scars so can you hear me?
When I call your name?
So can you hear me when I call your name?

And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?

You never said, you never said, you never said, you never said
When I call your name.
You never said, you never said, you never said, you never said
When I call your name.

Yeah!
And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?

And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me when I call your name?---Lyrics submitted by cindy.
