I was blown away what could I say
It all seemed to make sense
Youve taken away everything
And I cant do without
I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find

(Chorus)
Blow it away, Blow it away
Can we make this something goooood
Well I'll try to do it right this time around
Lets start oveeerr
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not oveeerr
Theres a part of me thats dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but youre the only one
It's not overrrrr
(Chorus)

Taken all I could take and I cannot wait
Were wasting to much time
Being strong holding on
Can't let it bring us down
My life with you means everything
So I wont give up that easily

(Chorus)
Blow it Away, Blow it Away
Can we make this something gooood
Cause its all misunderstoooood
Well I'll try to do it right this time around
Lets start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
Its not over
Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me
But youre the only one
Its not oveeeerrr
(Chorus)

We cant let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Dont get caught up in yourself
Let it ouuuuttttt

(Chorus)
Lets start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
Its not over
Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me
But youre the only one
Its not oveeer
Lets start oveeeerrr
Its not oveeerr, Oh yeah, yeah!
This love is killing me
But youre the only one
Its not oveeerrrr.....---Lyrics submitted by MissCailey.
