Today could have been the day, 
That you blew out your candles, 
Made a wish as you close your eyes, 
Today could have been the day, 
Everybody was laughing, 
Instead I just sit here and cry, 
Who would you be, 
What would you look like, 
When you looked at me for the very first time, 
Today could have been the next day of the rest of your life 

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you, 
I'm always asking why, 
Its crazy what I have to lose, 
Such a ray of light, 
We never knew, 
Gone to soon 

Would you have been president, 
Or a painter, 
And an author, 
Sing like your mother, 
One thing is evident, 
Would have given all I have, 
Would have loved you like no other, 
Who would you be, 
Would you have my smile, 
And her eyes, 
Today could have been the next day of the rest of your life 


Not a day goes by that I don't think of you, 
I'm always asking why, 
Its crazy what I have to lose, 
Such a ray of light, 
We never knew, 
Gone to soon, Yeah eh yeah

Whoa! 
Not a day goes by, 
Whoa, oh 
Whoa, oh 
I'm always asking why, 
Whoa! 

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you, 
I'm always asking why, 
Its crazy what I have to lose, 
Such a ray of light, 
We never knew, 
Gone to soon 

You were gone to soon, Yeah eh yeah 


Whoa, whoa oh 
Not a day goes by, 
That I don't think of your---Lyrics submitted by Eli McKay.
