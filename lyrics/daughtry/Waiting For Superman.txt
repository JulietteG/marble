Shes watching the taxi driver, he pulls away
Shes been locked up inside her apartment a hundred days

She says, Yeah, hes still coming, just a little bit late
He got stuck at the laundromat washing his cape
Shes just watching the clouds roll by and they spell her name like Lois Lane
And she smiles, oh the way she smiles

Shes talking to angels, counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
Shes dancing with strangers, falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, In his arms
Waiting for Superman

Shes out on the corner trying to catch a glimpse
Nothings making sense
Shes been chasing an answer
A sign lost in the abyss, this Metropolis

She says...Yeah, hes still coming, just a little bit late
He got stuck at the Five and Dime saving the day
She says...If life was a movie, then it wouldnt end like this
Left without a kiss
Still, she smiles, the way she smiles, yeah

Shes talking to angels, shes counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
Shes dancing with strangers, shes falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, In his arms
Shes waiting for Superman

To lift her up and take her anywhere
Show her love and climbing through the air
Save her now before its too late tonight
Oh, like a speeding light
And she smiles

Shes talking to angels, shes counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
Shes dancing with strangers, shes falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, In his arms
Shes waiting for Superman

To lift her up and take her anywhere
Show her love and climbing through the air
Save her now before its too late tonight
Shes waiting for Superman---
