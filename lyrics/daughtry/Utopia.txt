We're out in the golden now with cigarettes and knockled hearts
Life catch you and it beat you down
And throw your back against the wall
Singing oh, oh
It's funny how your life can change
And turn around on a dime
Yeah it can take you down the darkest lane
Then lead you into better time
Singing oh, oh

Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all we know is hell, hell, hell
If we make the new world
Then we've got a story to tell
Wo-oh, Wo-oh
Will we stand together-gether-gether
Or just get torn apart-part-part
This is utopia
Let's make a brand new start

Then claim around the book of life
But read it out a couple times
I've read and soaken on the sun
And sipping on the cheapest wine
Singing oh, oh

Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all we know is hell, hell, hell
If we make the new world
Then we've got a story to tell
Wo-oh, Wo-oh
Will we stand together-gether-gether
Or just get torn apart-part-part
This is utopia
Let's make a brand new start

Money can't buy us
Never said our souls were for sale
But they're gonna try us
We always succeed and fail
Singing oh, oh
This is utopia
Let's make a brand new start
This is utopia
Let's make a brand new start

Say heaven, heaven, heaven
When all we know is hell, hell, hell
If we make the new world
Then we've got a story to tell
Wo-oh, Wo-oh
Will we stand together-gether-gether
Or just get torn apart-part-part
This is utopia
Let's make a brand new start

This is utopia
Let's make a brand new start

This is utopia
Let's make a brand new start---
