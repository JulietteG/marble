I woke up today
Sinking like the stones that you have thrown
Wounded by the same old shots you take
I'ts easier to kick me when i'm low..

And i just thought that you should know
That i've been holding on
While you've been letting go
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time
Cause i know i said i'm sorry
But that's not what i meant to say..

I'm strong enough to say
That i don't wanna take the high road now
It's just so typical of you to walk away
When your perfect little world is burning down..

And i just thought that you should know
That i've been holding on
While you've been letting go
Can i be so bold?
Cause all this sucking up to you it's just getting old
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time
Cause i know i said i'm sorry
But that's not what i meant to say...

What i really meant to say
With every little breath i take
I'm not the only one who makes mistakes
Just think about the ones you've made..

And i just thought that you should know
That i've been holding on
While you've been letting go
Can i be so bold?
Cause all this sucking up to you it's just getting old
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time
Cause i know i said i'm sorry
But that's not what i meant to say...

Not what i meant to say...
Can i be so bold?
Cause all this sucking up to you is just getting old
Well, it's not too late to say it right this time 
Cause i know i said i'm sorry
But that's not what i meant to say...---Lyrics submitted by pani.
