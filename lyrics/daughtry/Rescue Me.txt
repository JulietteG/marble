our story's old
older than the wind
been sad for years, how can we pretend
that we all know just how it's gonna end

rescue me, i'm in the middle of the ocean
crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
some say it's easier to give up on it
i say it's time to rescue me

lost and lonely people standing by 
afraid to try
some of them here, same as you and i 
the differences are all but left behind
so i need you now

rescue me, i'm in the middle of the ocean
crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
some say it's hard to make the changes
rescue me and i'll never be the same

rescue me in the middle of my darkest hour
time will tell i never really had the power
some say it's easier to give up on it
i say it's time to rescue me

we gotta get out
how foolish we have been
to say its all just wasted time
we may lose and we may win
but like the sun, we will rise again
but until then 

rescue me, i'm in the middle of the ocean
crashing down, it's always hard to breathe
some say it's hard to make the changes
rescue me and i'll never be the same

rescue me in the middle of my darkest hour
time will tell i never really had the power
some say it's easier to give up on it
i say it's time to rescue me

rescue me in the middle of the ocean---Lyrics submitted by lana hogan.
