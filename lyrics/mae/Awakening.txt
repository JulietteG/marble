When I close my eyes, to this paradox place,
 I fly away, far away from here, I get away
 and dream, dream, of you,

 when it's all said and done, and the night 
has come, I'll dissappear, take flight 
on the wind of wishing you were here,
fading light, like a star who's life has been 
gone for years, 


and I'll fly, fly across the sky, and I'll leave leave
 it all behind if you'll be here here with me tonight 
I'll be fine I'll be fine I'll be fine

(oooooooooooooo)

and I'll dissappear, Take flight on the wind of 
wishing you were here fading lights like a star 
who's life has been gone for years 

And I'll fly, fly, across the sky, and I'll leave,
 leave it all behind, if you'll be, here, here with 
me tonight, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine,
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be, fine.---Lyrics submitted by Angelique.
