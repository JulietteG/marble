Am I alone in this?
Never a night where I can sleep myself till day.
We must try to figure it out, figure it out.
It won't be that easy,
We lost it somehow.

You come over unannounced.
Silence broken by your voice in the dark.
I need you here tonight
Just like the ocean needs the waves.

Oh, the night becomes the space
That's somewhere in between
What I feel and what I'm told
Sitting on the shoreline
Trying to figure it out. figure it out...
To find out the meaning
And reach it somehow.

You come over unannounced.
Silence broken by your voice in the dark.
I need you here tonight
Just like the ocean needs the waves.
Fall around me now
Like stars that shine and brighten the way.
I need you here tonight
Just like this night it needs the rain.

The season has changed.
The wind it blows colder now, colder now.
The clouds are raised.
The rain it falls harder now, all around.

You come over unannounced
(will you come over now?).
Silence broken by your voice in the dark.
I need you here tonight
Just like the ocean needs the waves
(I need you here tonight just like the waves).

Fall around me now (so fall around me now)
Like stars that shine and brighten the way.
I need you here tonight
Just like this night it needs the rain
(I need you here tonight just like the rain).

Over unannounced (will you come over now?).
Silence broken by your voice in the dark.
I need you here tonight
Just like the ocean needs the waves
(I need you here tonight just like the waves).

Just like the stars that fall around me now. ---Lyrics submitted by KatieLee.
