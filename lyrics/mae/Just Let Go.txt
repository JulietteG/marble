We've got all night just to make it all right 
Would you take a walk with me? 
I'll give you all I've got, just spare me your time 
And I promise you won't want to leave 

Are you 
Are you falling for me? 
This time 
We'll find what we both need... 

There's an old oak tree 
We can swing and sway 
We'll lock arms and legs 
(You're so far away) 
When I look at you 
You're so far away 
I'm so far away 
Oh, if you could just let go... 

Wet your eyes with me, just for a while 
I'll take you out of harm's way 
And like these branches that shelter the rain 
We can lay here in our own shade 

Are you 
Are you falling for me? 
Just watch 
The two of us will see... 

There's an old oak tree 
We can swing and sway 
We'll lock arms and legs 
(You're so far away) 
When I look at you 
You're so far away 
I'm so far away 

There is so much that I could give to you 
Just say you want me to 
I know these roots could break the ground 
And in the meantime, our leaves will turn 
But rest assured, we'll get through anything 

Are you 
Are you falling for me? 
Like I 
Oh, I'm falling for you... 

There's an old oak tree 
We can swing and sway 
We'll lock arms and legs 
(You're so far away) 
It's just you and me 
We can get away 
We can get away 
(You're so far away) 
In this lover's play 
We are happy here 
Oh, in every way 
Oh, and then we just let go... 
Just let go 
Just let go 
Just let go 
Just let go...---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
