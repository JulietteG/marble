Wasted time;
I cannot say that I was ready for this,
But when worlds collide,
And all that I have is all that I want;
The words seem to flow,
And the thoughts, they keep running,

And all that I have is yours,
And all that I am is yours.

Painted skies;
I've seen so many that cannot compare
To your ocean eyes;
The pictures you took
That cover your room,
And it was just like the sun,
But more like the moon.

A light that can reach it all.
So now I'm branded for taking the fall.

So when you say forever,
Can't you see?
You've already captured me.

(Instrumental)---Lyrics submitted by Janae P.
