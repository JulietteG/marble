It's magic
She says to me
My hand in her way
She approaches sweetly
It's enough when I see that look in her eyes
It's enough for me to paralyze

Whoa,Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown
well nothing feels good being under the gun
Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown Whoa,Whoa,Whoa

It's tragic
She says to me
a song in the air
we're together floating
what I miss everyday since our goodbye
was enough for me to realize

Whoa,Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown
well nothing feels good being under the gun
Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown
is it ever gonna come?

Whoa,Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown
well nothing feels good being under the gun
Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown Whoa,Whoa,Whoa

So take care what you wish for
It may come true
But the September sky
how I whispered 'I love you'
but I couldn't take it any longer
No I couldn't stand
But the night brought sparks
And the sparks brought flames
And you had to be sure
This wasn't one of those games,
But I'm gonna show you
If you could just
Give me tonight, tonight

Its fragile
She says to me
The hair in her eyes
She removes it, smiling
There's a wound that
I know this song could mend
A step in time
For us, will never end

Whoa,Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Well nothing feels good
Being under the gun
Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Is it ever gonna come?

Whoa,Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown
Well nothing feels good
Being under the gun
Whoa, I'm waiting for the breakdown Whoa,Whoa,Whoa
I'm waiting for the breakdown
I'm waiting for the comedown I'm waiting for the breakdown (she says it's magic)I'm waiting for the comedown (I'm floating weightless) I'm waiting ,Whoa,Whoa (she says it's magic)

for the breakdown (I'm floating weightless)
I'm waiting Whoa,Whoa, (she says it's magic)
for the comedown (here comes the breakdown)

I'm waiting,Whoa,Whoa (she says it's magic)
for the breakdown (I'm floating weightless)
