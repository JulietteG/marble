From the day that I met you girl
I knew that your love would be
Everything that I ever wanted in my life
From the moment you spoke my name
I new everything had changed
Because of you I felt my life would be complete

[Refrain]
Oh baby I need you
For the rest of my life girl I need you
To make everything right girl
I love you
And Ill never deny that I need you

Nothing matters but you my love
And only God above
Could be the one to know exactly how I feel
I could die in your arms right now
Knowing that you somehow
Would take my soul and keep it deep inside your heart

[Repeat refrain]

Girl your love to me feels just like magic
When you smile you have total control
You have power like nothing Ive felt before
Ive let all of my feelings show
Cuz I want you to know that.. I need you

I need you, for the rest of my life girl
I need you, say that youll be my wife oh
I love you, Wont you marry me marry me
Oh I need you (nobody but you)
Oooh I need you, for the rest of my life
Oh I need you (nobody but you)
Wont you marry me marry me
I love you, I really need ya baby (I really need nobody but you)
I need you
Girl I really need need you girl I really need you need you (I need you)
Oohhh baby I love you (I love you)
I need you, Girl I really need ya need ya  oh baby
Wont you marry me (I need you)
Wont you marry me marry me
I love you.. oohh ..
I need you. (I really need nobody but you)---Lyrics submitted by dione vanessa.
