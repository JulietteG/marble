I have been in love and been alone
I have traveled over many miles to find a home
There's that little place inside of me
That I never thought could take control of everything
But now I just spend all my time with anyone
Who makes me feel the way she does

'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she's not real it's all right
'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes and I fall for her every time

I've so many things I want to say
I'll be ready when the perfect moment comes my way
I had never known what's right for me
Till the night she opened up my heart and set it free
But now I just spend all my time with anyone
Who makes me feel the way she does

'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she's not real it's all right
'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes and I fall for her every time

Now I just spend all my time
With anyone who makes me feel the way she does

'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she's not real it's all right
'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes and I fall for her every time

'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she's not real it's all right
'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes and I fall for her every time

'Cause I only feel alive, only feel alive, when I dream at night
When your by my side even though she's not real it's all right
That's alright baby that's all right
'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes, holds my eyes---Lyrics submitted by lida ansari.
