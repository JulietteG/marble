And I Get A Little Krayzie When Its Time To Bone 
And I Like That U Think I Was One Of A Kind And 
My Ice Made U Think That Love Was Blind 
Separate The Great From The Weak, The Freaks

Let Her Know That I Got A Lot Of Dough She Ain't Gotta Know 
Take Her To Tha Room I Don't Need Ya Voice

Needs And U Swallowed My Seeds 
And Now I See, Why Choose One Freak? When..
