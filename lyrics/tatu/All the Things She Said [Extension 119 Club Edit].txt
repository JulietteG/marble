All The Things She Said
All the things she said 
All the things she said 
Running through my head 
All the things she said 
All the things she said 
Running through my head 
This is not enough 

I'm in serious shifts, I feel totally lost 
If I'm asking for help it's only because 
Being with you has opened my eyes 
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise? 

I keep asking myself, wondering how 
I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out 
Wanna fly to a place where it's just you and me 
Nobody else so we can be free 

All the things she said 
All the things she said 
Running through my head 
All the things she said 

All the things she said 
Running through my head 
This is not enough 
This is not enough 

All the things she said 
All the things she said 

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed 
They say it's my fault but I want her so much 
Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain 
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame When they stop and stare - don't worry me 
'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me 
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget 
But it's driving me mad, going out of my head 

Mother looking at me 
Tell me what do you see? 
Yes, I've lost my mind 

Daddy looking at me 
Will I ever be free? 
Have I crossed the line?---Lyrics submitted by anaira.
