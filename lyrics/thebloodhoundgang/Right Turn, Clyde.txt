times new roman, you know the type
call me public enemy, but don't believe in hype
tough guy like the one in "star eighty" wanna bait me
hook line and sinker, now ya lady wanna date me
give your girl a little wink, so ya make a big stank
completely incompatible, though im a pussy, your a dick
how can you hold a grudge when you can't even hold a job
should've known butter, but you're not corn on the cob
i chose to use a song for a weapon, not a sword, struck a chord
if i wanted to see start i'd watch the academy awards
thats why i ran like flock of seagulls winding up like mary kay
you must've given up on hair plugs, cause now you're going toupe
 all in all, you're just a dick with no balls (2x)
momma said talk this out and resolve
don't wanna be involved so give me a call when you evolve
doggy paddle to the shallow end of the gene pool
half with it half wit half finished high school
give you a piece of my mind but i know you want it splattered
heard you like your women like you like your shrimp you like em battered
wife beater perfeclty fitting the apparel
wheres your brother darrel wheres your other brother darrel
givin me that macho man randy savage stare
wanna snap into a slim jim break my limbs but do i care
no sorry im a lover not a fighter commit your crime
i'll be glad to do your girlfriend, i'll be glad that you do time
heres the deal i cop a feel you cop a plea but get the maximum
now we both got records but the difference is mines platinum
Definitely showed this yellow bellied wimp limp in your cell now though alone
When you're choking your chicken your chick will be choking on this chicken's
bone

All in all you're just another dick with no balls
All in all you're just another dick with no balls

Right turn Clyde
Right turn Clyde
Right turn Clyde
Right turn Clyde---Lyrics submitted by danny.
