Yea well I sing like an amputee though 
Why? 
Cause can't hold a note can't cary a tune 

Knock knock Mr. Rogers it's Mr. McFeelie 
I've brought you a letter speedy delivery 
Well Mr. McFeelie if there's postage due 
You can go fuck yourself like Captain Kangaroo 
I can go to land of make believe and I can pretend 
But in the end I still have no friends 

Do do do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do do do 

Mr. Rogers I like your cardigan sweater 
Mr. McFeelie shut up and give me my letter 
I don't want to talk to you don't you understand? 
Why are you inside my house you're just my fuckin' mailman? 
I can go to land of make believe and I can pretend 
But in the end I still have no friends 

Do do do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do do do 

You can go to land of make believe and you can pretend 
But in the end you still have no friends 
You can go to land of make believe and you can pretend 
But in the end you still have no friends 

Do do do do do do do do do 
Do do do do do do do do do 

You are my best friend too 
I share the same views and hardly ever argue 
Eat Spam from the can watch late night C-Span 
And rock out to old school Duran Duran 
Your best friend is you I'm my best friend too 
I share the same views and hardly ever argue 
Eat Spam from the can watch late night C-Span 
And rock out to old school Duran Duran 
Your best friend is you I'm my best friend too 
I share the same views and hardly ever argue 
Eat Spam from the can watch late night C-Span 
And rock out to old school Duran Duran.---Lyrics submitted by Crista.
