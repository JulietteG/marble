Na na na na na na na

Pulled that el Camino over 
Im standing at the great divide
Staring out the window 
at my small town city limit sign

My whole life Ive always turned around
But Ill never get out if I dont get out now

I need so much more see what this big world has in store
I need to break away point those taillights at yesterday
This small town girl aint small town anymore No
I need so much more

Na na na na na na na   Na na na na na na na

The sand between my toes sounds nice
 I might head down to the keys
But those city lights are calling
 So I just might chase those Nashville dreams

My whole life Ive always thought twice
So on second thought I think Ive finally got it right

I need so much more see what this big world has in store
I need to break away point those taillights at yesterday
This small town girl aint small town anymore No
Well I need so much more

Na na na na na na na  Na na na na na na na

Right now the answers that I need are not quite clear
But the one thing that Im sure of is I wont find them here

I need so much more see what this big world has in store
I need to break away point those taillights at yesterday
This small town girl aint small town anymore
No this small town girl aint small town anymore
 Yeah I need so much more

Na na na na na na na   yeah Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na  Na na na na na na na---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Klein.
