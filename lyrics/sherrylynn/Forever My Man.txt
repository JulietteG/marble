Anna Lisa Graham/Tony Marty
Im not your First Lover I may not be your last
Oh how I pray that I am I dont need to look further 
I am through looking back Cause this is my hearts last stand
Eternallyoh endlessly when you need me Ill be there
All the time everywhere
(Chorus)
OhYou will be forever my man
 I promise to love you the best that I can
And there are things about me you may never understand
But always remember youll be forever my man

Time might make you weak to anothers temptation
But oh how I pray that it wont
No one will ever touch me the way that you have
Youre the only truth Ive ever known
Dont need to question theres no doubt I could never live without you 
Oh Oh whoah
Oh there are things about you that I may never understand 
but always remember youll be forever my man
oh whoah youll be forever My Man---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
