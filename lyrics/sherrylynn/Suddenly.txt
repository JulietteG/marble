Donna Aylor/Marinus Vandertogt/Ande Rasmussen

Sitting in the Austin Airport
Waiting for my flight
You walk in front of me
With your new love by your side
You say hello and hug me
Im about to loose control
I thought our love was over
Til old feelings start to flow
(chorus)
Suddenly your voice 
Is like a knife cutting apart
Through layers of denial
Time has wrapped around my heart
Its like a wall of emotion suddenly broke loose(ooh ooh)(ooh ooh)
And suddenly I realized (Suddenly)
Im not over you

The loving way she looks at you
Fills me with regret
The sound of your sweet voice
Its hard to catch my breath
I accidentally touch your hand
And I fight to hold back my tears
You tell me you got married
Those words echo in my ears

(Repeat Chorus)
(Bridge)
The last thing I expected
Was to hear you call my name
The last thing I expected was to feel this way again

Suddenly your voice 
Is like a knife cutting apart
Through layers of denial
Time has wrapped around my heart
Its like a wall of emotion suddenly broke loose(ooh ooh)(ooh ooh)
And suddenly I realized (suddenly)
Im not over you
Suddenly Ive realized (suddenly)
Ive realized Im not over you---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
