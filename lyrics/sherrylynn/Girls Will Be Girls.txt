I can still remember me and my sister
Raiding mommas makeup, lipstick all over our face
Yeah what a mess we made

And Back when I was 15 Id leave the house in blue jeans
Take a short skirt and change when I got to school
No momma she never knew  No

Spring break college days
All Im gonna say about that
Is Girls will be Girls
From the start of this old world
Weve been shaking things up
Oh the trouble we can get into
Breaking hearts taking names
Driving all the little boys in sane
and that aint ever gonna change
oh girls will be girls. will be girls will be girls

the boys can have their Harleys all those bachelor partys
they get a little wild and they think their the crazy ones
aint got a thing on us. no
after a few margaritas oh you ought to see us
talking trash dancing on the bar
every eye in the room watching our every move
and when we get loud they dont kick us out they just shake their heads

and say Girls will be Girls
From the start of this old world
Weve been shaking things up
Oh the trouble we can get into
Breaking hearts taking names
Driving all the little boys in sane
and that aint ever gonna change
oh girls will be girls will be girls will be girls

well let you see our sweeter side
if you hold us close and treat us right
and if your lucky well even let you put a ring on our hand
as long as you understand
that girls will begirls will be girlsoh girls will be girls will be
breaking hearts taking names driving all the little boys in sane
and that aint never gonna change
oh girls will be girls will be girls will be girls---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Klein.
