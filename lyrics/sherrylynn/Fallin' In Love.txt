If I could tell you now what Im thinking bout
Youd probably look at me like Ive gone crazy
You get that silly grin Laugh it off and then
I get this feelin that baby maybe

Youve been thinking bout it  you just dont know how to
Take a chance and open up Its not that hard to do
Go on and make your move Your hearts already done it
You keep on running from it
Why cant you just admit your fallin in love

Boy you cant disguise I see it in your eyes
I dont know who it is you think your foolin
Youve got yourself convinced but I see the evidence
Its clear in every little thing your doin


Youve been thinking bout it  you just dont know how to
Take a chance and open up Its not that hard to do
Go on and make your move Your hearts already done it
You keep on running from it
Why cant you just admit your fallin in love

Admit your Fallin in love

Ooh I know you want to do it go on and get down to it
Why cant ya just admit youre fallin
Your hearts already done it you keep on runnin from it
Why cant you just admit your fallin in love
Admit your fallin in love---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Klein.
