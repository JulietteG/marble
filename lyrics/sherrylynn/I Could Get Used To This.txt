Im almost there just a couple more miles
Then its just you and me and a bottle of wine
Leave the world outside
Its been a long week and long long days
But you know just what to do just what to say

When Im worn out weighed down
Boy you turn my world around
And make everything ok

Cause there aint nothing I can compare to your lovin
Baby Ill tell you its something I just cant resist
The way you hold me kiss me and pull me in slowly
Heaven knows where its going or how your doing it
But honey I could to this

Theres something in the way you make me smile
And baby how you make me laugh out loud
It just feels so right
Cause Ive had tough luck in love
boy Id almost given up Until you came along

Cause there aint nothing I can compare to your lovin
Baby Ill tell you its something I just cant resist
The way you hold me kiss me and pull me in slowly
Heaven knows where its going or how your doing it
But honey I could to this

This feelin I get I can let myself be myself
Aint no one else can love me like you
Do the things that you do to me

Cause there aint nothing I can compare to your lovin
Baby Ill tell you its something I just cant resist
The way you hold me kiss me and pull me in slowly
Heaven knows where its going or how your doing it
But honey I could to this.I could get used to this---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Klein.
