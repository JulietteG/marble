Hes got a dent in his bumper and his windshields cracked
Old leather seat with a rip in the back logos peelin on a worn out dash
Baby I like em like that
Hes got a whole in his boot and a tear in his jeans
Runs on empty lives on dreams stubborn as they come and he drives too fast
Baby I like em like that

Rough around the edges sweet around the heart
Tough in the daylight tender in the dark
Rebel in his spirit angel in his eyes
Once you kiss him once you gotta kiss him twice
Its a dangerous plan but theres something bout a man good at being bad
And baby I like em like that

Hes got a grin full of sin that will make you burn
Walks in a room and every head turns
The kind of man you cant help staring atbaby I like em like that
Girls all stare but he dont see their all wishing that they were me
Cause Im the only one hes looking atbaby I like em like that

Rough around the edges sweet around the heart
Tough in the daylight tender in the dark
Rebel in his spirit angel in his eyes
Once you kiss him once you gotta kiss him twice
Its a dangerous plan but theres something bout a man. good at being bad
baby I like em like that
Rough around the edges sweet around the heart
Tough in the daylight tender in the dark
Rebel in spirit angel in his eyes
Once you kiss him once you gotta kiss him twice
Its a dangerous plan but theres something bout a man good at being bad
And baby I like em like that
Like em like that
got a dent in his bumper and his windshields cracked
Mmm like em like that---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Klein.
