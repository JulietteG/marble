Denny Carr / Larry Haack

Near a little old farming town
A farmer and his daughter
Worked a parched field
In the hot summer sun
As he cursed the dry weather
And the passing of his wife
His daughter said daddy
Now dont worry none.
Mamma taught me a song
Last night in a dream
She said if I sing it
And only believe
When that scarecrow starts dancing
God will make it rain
So she sat in that field for two weeks straight

Singing dance scarecrow dance
This towns all but dried up 
Better get moving
Lets scare up some clouds
Wont you kick up a storm 
If theres any magic in you
Oh Dance scarecrow dance
Make the rain come down

Her daddy said this aint right
The town folk are talking
Im gonna burn that scarecrow
Down to the ground
As they both stood there watching 
The flames grew higher
The wind started blowing
And the sky filled with clouds
Then it came down in buckets
And the fire died away
As that scarecrow danced 
To mother natures ballet
That field turned to mud
And her daddy broke down
Put an end to disbelieving 
And six months of drought


Singing dance scarecrow dance
This towns all but dried up 
Better get moving
Lets scare up some clouds
Wont you kick up a storm 
If theres any magic in you
Dance scarecrow dance
Make the rain come downYeah


(Instrumental Break)

Oh dance scarecrow dance
This towns all but dried up 
Better get moving
Lets scare up some clouds
Wont you kick up a storm 
If theres any magic in you
Oh Dance scarecrow dance
Make the rain come downYeah
Make the rain come down---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
