Glenn Ashworth/Dana Sigmon

When I was just a girl
I traded in my curls
For a ponytail and baseball glove
Playing with the boys Making lots of noise
Stuff that only tom boys love
All my girlfriends 
Played with barbies and kens
Skipping rope and dressing up
They would laugh and tease Making fun of me
But now this little girls grown up

And Im playing with the big boys now
Kind of funny how some minds have changed
All the girls who used to laugh at me
Now their wishing they were in my place
Im the same girl I used to be
Catching passes that are thrown at me
Nothings changed but the game
Im playing with the big boys now

Looking back in time
Ive got to say that Im
Happy about my childhood days
Ive never learned to sew But honey dont you know
Ive learned about the way boys play
Now that Im grown Out on my own
Using what Ive found out then
How to give and take
How to spot a fake
How to play the game the way

That Im playing with the big boys now
Kind of funny how some minds have changed
All the girls who used to laugh at me
Now their wishing they were in my place
Im the same girl I used to be
Catching passes that are thrown at me
Nothings changed but the game
Im playing with the big boys now
(Instrumental Break)
(Chorus)
