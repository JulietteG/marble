Kalii Palmer/Ronnie Kimball/Sandy Ramos

Its a beautiful day and Im riding round got the top down
And the radios playing Keith Urban
And the wind is blowin through my hair hey I dont care
If my heart is breakin
I love the feeling of the open road
Im getting better every mile I go oh oh

Hey What a Day to shake a heartache
I might think its time to find my way
Back to who I was before Bye bye baby thats for sure
Hey What a Day to shake a heartache

Not a cloud up there in the summer sky
And I wonder why I waited so many lonely nights
Crying getting over you Im so over due
Hey enough already
My heart is lighter and its all so clear
It feels so good just getting out of here

Hey What a Day to shake a heartache
I might think its time to find my way
Back to who I was before Bye bye baby thats for sure
Hey What a Day to shake a heartache

I love the feeling of the Open Road
Im Getting Better every mile I go

Hey What a Day to shake a heartache
I think its time I find my way
Hey What a Day to shake a heartache
I think its time I find my way

Back to who I was before Bye bye baby thats for sure
Hey What a Day to shake a heartache---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
