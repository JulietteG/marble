Love Or Something Like ItJerry Blackburn / Ron Stevens

Barely 13 met a boy in the neighborhood
Swore it was love 
Holding hands every chance we could
Our parents said thats not love
But that first kiss sure felt good

It gave me butterflies stars in my eyes
Cold chills on a hot summer night
Made me feel silly, Giddy
Laughing and a smiling a natural high
Momma said its hard to describe it
The difference in love or something like it

All grown up out with a couple friends
Met the perfect guy
Thought I fell in love with him
It didnt last like I planned
Here I am Im back to lonely again

I miss those butterflies, stars in my eyes
Cold chills on a hot summer night
Feeling silly, Giddy
Laughing and a smiling a natural high
I dont really care how you describe it
Im looking for love or something like it

Here I am Im sitting in this honky tonk
What Im doing some may say is wrong
Im just looking for someone to hold me
Awhile until the lonely is gone

I want to feel butterflies, stars in my eyes
Cold chills on a hot summer night
Feeling silly, Giddy
Laughing and a smiling a natural high
I dont really care how you describe it
Im looking for love or something like it
No I dont really care how you describe
Im just looking for love or something like it---Lyrics submitted by Raymond MacKay.
