Theres something on the radio I know 
and it feels like home yeah it takes me home 
to slow dancing in the bed of a truck til the sun comes up
watch the sun come up
no it never fails baby I go there 
every time I turn it on I find you in a song

and I catch myself humming along
 cause there aint no sunshine when youre gone
and youre always on my mind 
every time I turn that dial
 I can hear you singing off key to stand by me
Oh you sound so sweet with the melody
No I cant go on if that radios on 
Yeah I find you in a song yeah

It doesnt matter what station I play
 and what theyre singing its all true
cause ever since you walked into my life
no matter where I am I feel you
pull me close to you beneath that summer moon
baby its your love no I cant get enough

and I catch myself humming along
to this crazy little thing called love
and you light up my life  every time I turn that dial
I can hear you singing off key to lean on me 
Oh you sound so sweet with the melody
No I cant go on if that radios on
Yeah I find youIn every note in every situation
 I dont want these songs to ever quit playing

and I catch myself humming along
to aint no sunshine when youre gone
and youre always on my mind 
every time I turn that dial
 I can hear you singing off key to stand by me
Oh you sound so sweet with the melody
No I cant go on if that radios on 
Yeah I find youYeah I hear you 
I find youI find you in a songx3 yeah eh yeah---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie Klein.
