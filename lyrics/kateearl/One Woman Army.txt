Never knew what I was signing up for
Knew it was hard but not this hardcore
Never gonna stop, never gonna give up on you
No matter what I do

(Chorus)
Here I am baby, Im your one woman army
Id fight for you, Ill die, Ill be your protector
Here I am baby, Im your one woman army
No matter what may come, I wont surrender

Wanna give you everything I never had
Love you and teach you good from bad
Never gonna stop, never gonna give up on you
No matter what I do

(Chorus)
Here I am baby, Im your one woman army
Id fight for you, Ill die, Ill be your protector
Here I am baby, Im your one woman army
No matter what may come, I wont surrender

What I do, I do for you the best I can
Build a life for you with my own two hands
Never gonna stop, never gonna give up on you
No matter what I do

(Chorus) X3
Here I am baby, Im your one woman army
Id fight for you, Ill die, Ill be your protector
Here I am baby, Im your one woman army
No matter what may come, I wont surrender---Lyrics submitted by stephanie adams.
