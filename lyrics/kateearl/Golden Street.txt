People keep saying that Im a little short on Mercy
Say my god forsaken soul will buy me things
Fame & fortune, pearly gates & silver wings
Yeah I picked out curtains for my place on Golden Street

People been calling me sinner
Been calling me wayward saint
Caught a snag along the path that they call straight
Looked down & I say that I had lost my faith
Turned my back on promises Id never break

~Chorus:
These days
Im just trying to find out what love means
Find my place within this crazy scene
These days
Im just trying to find out what love means
Find my place within this dream
~

People been saying Im going to hell if I dont change
But I sold my soul to God when I was barely 8
All of Jacobs Ladders couldnt rescue me
All because I bought that house on Golden Street

Built a bridge between our hearts but it was weak
Little did I know it wouldnt hold my weight
Now Im falling fast into a great revene
Wonder when I land if Ill be on my feet

~Chorus~

Bridge:
Can you spare me father?
A moment of your time?
Whyd you hide the answersIn, In between the lines?
Life has many colorsMore than black & white!
Why do I have questions?
If, If youre always right?

~Chorus~
