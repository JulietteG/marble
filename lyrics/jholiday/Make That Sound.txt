they will hear us through these walls
(they will hear us through these walls)
if we make any kind of noise
(if we make any kind of noise)
and i got plans to make you scream
(and i got plans to make you scream)
'til you get close to losin' your voice
(losin' your voice)
so don't you hide up in them sheets
(so don't you hide up in them sheets)
im already not sopose to be heere noo
so don't you worry about gettin' in trouble
(trouble)

chorus
Turn up the radio, so you can yell as loud as you want
Turn up the t.v, i dont want no body to hear me, hear me while i make you moan
when you make that sound girl
when you make that sound girl
when you make that yell as loud as you want
when you make that sound girl 
when you make that sound girl
when you make that yell as loud as you want

Girl now you wont need a pillow to cover up your mouth
i just want to see that pretty face of yours
doin that special thing i do all the while your pushing against me against the headboard
beggin to go deeper 
baby deeper
you know ill bust between ya
make you speak girl
follow me now ill be your leader 
we aint stop til your body needs a breather

chorus
Turn up the radio so you can yell as loud as you want
Turn up the t.v, i dont want no body to hear me, hear me while i make you moan
when you make that sound girl 
when you make that sound girl
when you make that yell as loud as you want
when you make that sound girl 
when you make that sound girl
when you make that yell as loud as you want

hold up
now baby if you let me give it to you all night then you cant go wrong
so imma turn the radio up
so i can hear you screamin' at the top of your lungs
