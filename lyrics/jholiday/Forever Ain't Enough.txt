mmmmMMM ohohohoh yeah yeah,,, yeah yeah yeah hee yeah 

Thinkin back, to the feelin that I had when I first saw your face
I knew that it was you
Some time has passed, and the feelings that I had before still are the same
cause you never changed, no 

Even though I dont show it girl
I just want you to know
(That even if we fight a million times over little things), we can still make it better
(I meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring), that imma love you forever
(I fall for you deeper everyday), feel it now girl more than ever 
(but with our type of love,) forever aint enough

I've been searchin my whole life, 
I'm lucky I found you
no better girl cause you aint leavin 
cause forever aint enough 

You see me for who I am and not for who I'm not no, 
I'm tellin you that I'm sorry if I tend to treat you the wrong way
but I care you know my heart is there 

Even though I dont show it girl
I just want you to know
That even if we fight (that even if we fight a million times over little things)
we can still make it better 
I meant what I said when I gave you that promise ring that I'mma love youu forever
(I fall for you deeper everyday) feel it now girl more than ever
(but with our type of love), forever ain't enough

(Forever ain't enough, ain't enough, no)I've been searchin my whole life,(forever ain't enough, ain't enough, no) I'm lucky I found you(forever aint enough, ain't enough,no), (forever aint enough noo) no better girl too, you ain't leavin 
forever ain't enough (forever ain't enough) 
forever ain't enough (forever ain't enough) 
forever ain't enough yeaheeyea(forever ain't enough)
forever ain't enough oo woah it ain't enough 

(That even if we fight a million times over little things) we can still make it better 
(I meant what I said when i gave you that promise ring) that Imma love you forever
( I fall for you deeper everyday) feel it now girl more than ever
(But with our type of love), forever ain't enough,,,
