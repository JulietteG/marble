See there's this lady, that lives on the street
She has no job, no home, no family
And she barely has the chance to even eat
So she begs, and steals, and sells her body
Sometimes she may come off a little strong
But she's just on her own
But is it was you
What would you do
If you didn't have a home
If you didn't have a pot to piss in
Didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless
Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you
There's a man, on the street
He's got holes in his shoes, on his feet
We be in the club spending doe
Then we'd come outside and tell him (?)
All he needs is a couple bucks
He's got a little change but it's not enough
We turn our backs and laugh
But we stop in our tracks
And turn the other way, because we got it made
Sometimes we make 'em (?)
Just a little strong
But he's on his own
But what about you
What would you do
If you didn't have a home
If you didn't have a pot to piss in
Didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless
Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you
A new day when i open my eyes
Got a black president but there's people outside
I know you've seen 'em and we all done passed 'em
Some people seen some shit last night
Still got 'em laughin
but it's not funny, It's all about money
And I bet you won't go put on them shoes
Crazy because we're out clubbin
aint worried bout nothing
But imagine is that person was you
(imagine is it was you)---Lyrics submitted by NIYAHPOOH.
