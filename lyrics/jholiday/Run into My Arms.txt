Baby girl
Drop your guard, I won't hurt you no
Baby I wanna give you everything you need
I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your knight in shinin' armour
But baby you gotta let me

Just like in the movies baby, ima come to ya rescue
Ima rescue you
And i know this might sound crazy, but I think i'm here to protect you
So girl, can you stop running
This aint that kinda lovin i got ya
Just run into my arms and i will show you

Baby you can run into my arms
And baby you know that I will do no harm
Cause i can be your everything
Your superman whatever you need
I can be
Just run into my arms

Baby girl, youve been hurt
I know, that your heart is half gone
But I promise that you'll be my queen
If you let me
I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your knight in shinin' armour
But baby you gotta let me

Just like in the movies baby, ima come to ya rescue
Ima rescue you
And i know this might sound crazy, but I think I'm here to protect you
So girl, can you stop running
Cause this aint that kinda lovin i got ya
Just run into my arms
And baby I will show you

Baby you can run into my arms
And baby you know that I will do no harm
Cause I can be your everything
Your superman whatever you need
I can be
Just run into my arms

Girl dont be afraid give me your hand and lets just fly away
And baby you know I'll always keep you safe
And girl I promise that I'll love you
I wont do you wrong
Just open up your heart and baby run into my arms

Baby you can run into my arms
And baby you know that I will do no harm
Cause I can be your everything
Your superman whatever you need
I can be
Just run into my arms

Baby you can run into my arms
And baby you know that I will do no harm
Cause I can be your everything
Your superman whatever you need
I can be
Just run into my arms

Just call me holiday, holiday, holiday---Lyrics submitted by Jamie.
