Don't choke on that homeboy blow it out
Don't sip on that Gin pour a little out
Let your life reflect what comes outta ya mouth
And never pull out your piece unless you dumpin' out
Never fear no man but know when to run
Leave no man standing till the battle is won
And when its getting real good better pull it out
When niggas front don't give up my brother sweat it out


And don't smoke what you don't roll up
And act right if ya know you can't fight (take it easy)
Take a test if you unsure if its yours
Theres a 1 percent chance that it might be another mans.
And we know the life we been living, one day we might fall
And the only choices we giving got our backs against the wall.
And I know we're all God's children
He's got love for us all
We been living these thugs, these thug commandments

Stop cuffing that young girl let her breathe
Be a father to you kids plant healthy seeds
No Do-rags in the lords house
Trust in the lord but keep a glock in your house
When you talking to a man look him dead in his eye
Never get high off your own supply
Gotta think fast stash a little cash
watch them snake niggas they slither in the grass

We fall down but we get up
We sell out and we ....
And we keep watch from the rooftops for the cops
Hi snitches tap the telephone switches
We get paid but we wont stay
Right back slanging with a story to tell
And it goes round and round like a revolving wheel
It never changes thats how the game is

We fall down but we get up
We sell out and we ....
And we keep watch from the rooftops for the cops
Hi snitches tap the telephone switches
We get paid but we wont stay
Right back slanging with a story to tell
And it goes round and round like a revolving wheel
It never changes thats how the game is

and you know the life that we live in that one day we might fall
And the only choices we've been giving got our backs against a wall
And we know we're all god's children
He's got love for us all
We've been living these thug (These Thug) these thug (These Thug) Commandments (We Share)

We fall down but we get up
We sell out and we ....
And we keep watch from the rooftops for the cops
Hi snitches tap the telephone switches
We get paid but we wont stay
Right back slanging with a story to tell
And it goes round and round like a revolving wheel
It never changes its all a game kid---Lyrics submitted by Kyla.
