There was a lady on the mountain
Eyes up [?] in the sun
Hair flow down my shoulders like the river
I can see chance, move up and down
Started calling out
She was calling out to you
You recall it now, she was calling out to you
You gotta do right by your woman
As she'll do right by you

Walking [?]
She can't find the light she need within
You can hear her ego on the mountain side
Awful singing feeling you can't swing
She was calling out
She was calling out to you
You hear her calling now
She was calling out to you
You gotta do right by your woman
As she'll do right by you

She was calling out
She was calling out to you
You hear her calling now
Calling out to you
You gotta do right by your woman
As she'll do right by you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
