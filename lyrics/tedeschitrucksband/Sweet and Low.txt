I wasn't always around
When we felt so low down
She was your shoulder you cried on
When I weighed you down

Not pure like sugarcane
Sweeter
She was so sweet when you were alone
Sweet and low
Aftertaste like a real sad storm
Sweeter
She was so sweet when you were alone
Sweet and low

When there is nothing left to say
And her siren song fades away
Maybe you'll crave a bitter sweet melody

Not pure like sugarcane
Sweeter
She was so sweet when you were alone
Sweet and low
She seems to heal the pain inside you
Oh, inside you
I was so mean when you were alone
Sweet and low

Not pure like sugarcane
Sweeter
She was so sweet when you were alone
Sweet and low
She seems to soothe the pain inside
Oh, inside you
We were so sweet before we were alone
Oh, so alone

Now you were the one that was so long gone
Oh, how was I to know you didn't want me around?
Was I a dreamer? Where you a lover?
Was I fighter? Did you find something finer?
Oh, what did she have? Love that I didn't
Was she sweeter? Or finer lover?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
