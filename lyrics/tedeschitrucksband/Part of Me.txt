I wasn't sure
If you coming back to me
All of your loving
The plans you wrote our sweet melody
These are the days
The days that reflect in from the times that we had
I'm going away all the love
Until the day when you come home

Don't you know I'll never love another friend?
All my love for you
Search the world, I'll find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me

I was on a rough patch
When I realized I looked back
And I knew what I saw
I saw you play a song for me
You brought me to tears
You brought me people
Dropped me to my knees
It was love, love for real
It was something that I'd never feel

Don't you know I'll never love another friend?
All my love for you
Search the world, I'll find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me

Together we fall
And we left the storm behind
You gave me shelter
And it helped her pass the time
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna let you pass me by

Don't you know I'll never love another friend?
All my love for you
Search the world, I'll find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me

Don't you know I'll never love another friend?
All my love for you
Search the world, I'll find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me

You set me free

Don't you know I'll never love another friend?
Don't you know that you're the only one?
All my love for you
Search the world, I'll find you
Another man of your kind
And say all the years attending me

Don't you know that you're a part of me? ---
