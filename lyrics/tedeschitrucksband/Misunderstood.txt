Things just aren't going nowhere
I've been back and forth through hell
I'm tired of racing idly around the track
For some reason I just keep coming back

Patiently waiting here for your call
While you're tearing away from it all

I might as well be misunderstood
You're not hearing me so good
I might as well be in the dark
You can't see things falling apart, no

It's like a love that you never dared
It's like a pain that I never felt
Go on and cuff me so I can bleed
Just let me have it so I can be free

Patiently waiting here for your call
While you're tearing away from it all

I might as well be misunderstood
You're not hearing me so good
I might as well be in the dark
You can't see things falling apart, no

Rain fell of the things that you have said 
Outside you're dry
You thought you had slept so long
Left it all meanwhile

You hear the sound of silence as the marching band goes by
Love you but I'm leaving here
Don't say I didn't try

I might as well be misunderstood
You're not hearing me so good, no
I might as well be in the dark
You can't see things falling apart, no

I might as well be misunderstood
You're not hearing me so good
I might as well be in the dark
You can't see things falling apart

I might as well be misunderstood
'Cause you ain't giving me so good
I might as well be in the dark
Can you see it falling apart?
