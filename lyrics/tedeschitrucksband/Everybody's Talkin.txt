Everybody's talking at me 
I don't hear a word they're saying 
Only the echoes of my mind 

People stopping staring 
I can't see their faces 
Only the shadows of their eyes 

I'm going where the sun keeps shining 
Through the pouring rain 
Going where the weather suits my clothes 
Banking off of the North East wind 
Sailing on a summer breeze 
And skipping over the ocean like a stone 

I'm going where the sun keeps shining 
Through the pouring rain 
Going where the weather suits my clothes 
Banking off of the North East wind 
Sailing on a summer breeze 
And skipping over the ocean like a stone 

Everybody's talking at me 
I don't hear a word they're saying 
Only the echoes of my mind 
I won't let you leave my love behind 
No I won't let you leave 
I won't let you leave my love behing---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
