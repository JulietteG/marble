Oh, what have we done?
To this kingdom we proclaim
To be the chosen one
Everything is choosing in each and every domain
Everything is frozen
Burning just the same

Oh, its so heavy
Oh, its so heavy
Oh, its so heavy
Ive got let it all
Let it all go

Oh I thought weve passed all the lies
They will come for us with darker mirrors
And paint our skin with colored eyes
Oh I thought we were last the time
When injustice was a leader
Rand liberty last

Oh, its so heavy
Oh, its so heavy
Oh, its so heavy
Ive got let it all
Let it all go

Oh, we are marching
We are fighters without a cause
Cause its easier to be in the crowd
Then cry alone crying out loud
You gotta feel the pain, you got to see the suffering
Gotta hear the cause

Oh, its so heavy
Oh, mama, dont you know its so heavy?
Lord its so heavy
Ive got let it all
Let it all go
Oh, its so heavy
Oh, its so heavy
Oh, its so heavy
Ive got let it all
Let it all go
Oh, its so heavy
Lord its so heavy
Oh, its so heavy
Ive got let it all
Let it all go---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
