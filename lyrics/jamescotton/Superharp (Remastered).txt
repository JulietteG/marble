Down in the yard tryin' to fix my ride
Busted my knuckles and I went inside
Just made it worse I tried to fix up my hand
I aint much of a medicine man
Alot of things that i wanna do
That don't work out the way I want 'em to
One thing that I do just right
When it comes to love I'm certified

Yes I got my degree
Doctor of love I got a PHD
If you some kind of lovin' that you never tried
Come to me I'm certified

Out on the job and the bossman yell
Here we go again, I'm gonna catch some hell
He say if you screw up one more time
You'll be in the unemployment line
Alot of jobs that I can do
Even more I never too
One place I know I'm qualified
When I comes to love I'm certified

Yes I got my degree
Doctor of love I got a PHD
If you some kind of lovin' that you never tried
Come to me I'm certified

Nothin come easy and you know that's a fact
Workin for the man about to break my back
5 o'clock and the whistle blow
I'm the first on out the do'
You can bet I'll be headed home
Don't wanna leave my woman alone
One thing she says that I do just right
When it come to love I'm certified

Yes I got my degree
Doctor of love I got a PHD
If you some kind of lovin' that you never tried
I'm certified---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
