Of all the boys I've known and I've known some
Until I first met you I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist du schn, please let me explain
'Bei mir bist du schn' means you're grand
Bei mir bist du schn, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say 'bella, bella' even 'sehr wunderbar'
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain, 'bei mir bist du schn'
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist du schn
You've heard it all before but let me try to explain
'Bei mir bist du schn' means that you're grand
'Bei mir bist du schn,' it's such an old refrain
And yet I should explain, it means I am begging for your hand

I could say 'bella, bella' even 'sehr wunderbar'
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I could say 'bella, bella' even 'sehr wunderbar'
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain 'bei mir bist du schn'
So kiss me and say that you will understand! ---
