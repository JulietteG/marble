you've been down in the dumps it seems like forever now what have they done to you
not a single things turned out the way you'd imagined it all looks unreachable to you
you don't know for the life of you just what is missing or why it always happens to you
and you don't like yourself you feel nobody's listening you don't need another platitude
for a moment you forget and a smile comes to your face ah but it doesn't last too long
its like a string you got tied around your finger reminding you of everything that's wrong
I won't try to say i know what your feeling I won't try to second guess you
I won't try to give advice you won't be needing
I'm only here to comfort you I'm only here to comfort you
and I'd love to be the reason that a smile comes to your face even if it doesn't last too long
and I'd like to take that string you got tied around your finger
reminding you of everything that's wrong I won't try to say I know what you're feeling
I won't try to second guess you I won't try to give advice you won't be needing
I'm only here to comfort you I'm only here to comfort you I'm only here to comfort you
I'm only here to comfort you---Lyrics submitted by kim.
