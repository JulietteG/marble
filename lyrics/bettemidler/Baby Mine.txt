Baby mine dont you cry
Baby mine dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, Baby of mine

Little one when you play
Pay no heed to what they say
Let your eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, Baby of mine

If they knew all about you
They end up loving you too
All those same people who scold you 
What theyd give just for the right to hold you

From your head down to your toes
Your not much goodness knows
But youre so precious to me
Sweet as can be, Baby of mine---Lyrics submitted by Valerie Thompson.
