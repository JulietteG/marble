I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

And i guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
Cause i'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like nobodys love me 
Come rain or come shine
Happy together unhappy together
And wont it be fine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But i'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
Rain or shine---Lyrics submitted by Stacey.
