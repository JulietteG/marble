It isn't the paddle, it's not the canoe,
It isn't the river or skies that are blue,
It isn't the love dreams that bring joy to you,
It's the girl, oh, it's the girl!

It isn't the progress that you always want to do,
It isn't the mountain flowers or the mornin' dew,
It isn't the love nest that brings love to you,
It's the girl that makes you happy and it's the girl that makes you blue!

You up and down men,
What a lonely world would be without them!

It isn't the songbirds, the song that they sing,
It isn't the sunshine that makes you like Spring,
So what is this magic that makes all the thing?
It's the girl, oh, it's the girl!

Some folks need atmosphere when they're makin' love,
They say old mother nature makes love grand!
Still, lovers will complain that they need a shove,
If you're a Romeo, you'll you'll gonna understand!

It isn't the paddle, it's not the canoe,
It isn't the river or skies that are blue,
It isn't the love beams that bring joy to you,
Wherever you go, whatever you do, it's the girl!

It isn't the progress that you wanna do,
It isn't the mountains, the flowers or the mornin' dew,
It isn't the love nest that brings love to you,
It's the girl, it's the girl!

It's not the places you go,
It's not the crowd,
It's not the folks you know,
So listen while I shout out loud!

It's the girl!---
