It's midnight in Memphis
and all the boys are out tonight.
Oh, midnight in Memphis,
but my true love is not in sight.
The neon's glowing,
but I just don't see the light.

I'm following my footsteps
trying to find myself a friend.
Oh, baby! Following my footsteps
trying to see where they might end.
I'm tryin' to break these blues,
but I can't even get them to bend.

Oh, midnight in Memphis.
Well, ya take me away.
Midnight in Memphis.
It's a long, long time
before the day.

Runnin' down on Beale Street.
Can you hear that engine roar?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Runnin' down on Beale Street.
There's a girl in every door.
Yeah, it don't matter what you got,
they're asking me for more.
Play it for me one time, boys.

I heard the river risin',
risin' up over my head.
Yeah, heard the river risin',
and this is what it said:
"I don't need no live ones;
I just take care of the dead."

Oh, midnight in Memphis.
Take me, take me away.
Midnight in Memphis.
It's a long, long time
before the day.

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, midnight in Memphis.
Midnight in Memphis.
Midnight in Memphis.
It's a long, long time
before the day,
before the day. ---Lyrics submitted by Jean  Wright.
