Some say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a hunger 
An endless, aching need 
I say love it is a flower
And you its only seed

Its the heart afraid of breaking 
That never learns to dance
Its the dream afraid of waking 
That never takes the chance

Its the one who wont be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying 
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long 
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose---Lyrics submitted by zoila.
