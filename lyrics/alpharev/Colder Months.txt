I put on my usual
Pack a picture from my cubicle
All I can think about is you
I'm still bleedin'
I'm still bleedin'

Took the L to Union Square
Watched the pretty girls comb their hair
They turn away as I turn and stare
I'm still bleedin'
I'm still bleedin'

These thoughts of pain
Don't make a sound
They keep us hidden
In the lost and found
These colder months, wincing social graces
We keep with us, these fallen faces

Took a call from an old, old friend
Out of money, in jail again
I posted bail and took him in
I'm still bleedin'
We're both bleedin'

These thoughts of pain
Don't make a sound
They keep us hidden
In the lost and found
These colder months, wincing social graces
We keep with us, these fallen faces
We keep with us, these fallen faces

These thoughts of pain
They'll make a sound
To keep us hidden
In the lost and found
In these colder months, wincing social graces
We keep with us, these fallen faces

Don't make a sound
They keep us hidden in the lost and found
These colder months, wincing social graces
We keep with us
We keep with us, these fallen faces---Lyrics submitted by kai.
