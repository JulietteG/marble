Uncore, hardcore
Rock you down to
the floor
Posse saw ya on the border
Jungle jumper under order

Uncore, hardcore
Rock you down to
the floor
Posse saw ya on the border
Jungle jumper under order

Every minute, every hour, got the power
Take a shower, brand stuff
Screaming lord, wickend and tough

Uncore, hardcore
Rock you down to
the floor
Posse saw ya on the border
Jungle jumper under order

Every minute, every hour, got the power
Take a shower, brand stuff
Screaming lord, wickend and tough

(Right now, say lord have mercy)

I've got the money
I've got the place
You've got the figure
You've got the face
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

(Singing...Jumping all over the world)

I've got the music
I've got the lights
You've got the figure
Full of delights
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

(Let me hear you...Jumping all over the world)

I've got the position
I've got the name
You've got the power
To drive me insane
We're jumping all over
All over the world

(Everybody...Jumping all over the world)

I've got the money
I've got the place
You've got the figure
You've got the face
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

(All together now)

Uncore, hardcore
Rock you down to the floor
Posse saw ya on the border
Jungle jumper under order

Every minute, every hour, got the power
Take a shower, brand stuff
Screaming lord, wickend and tough

Uncore, hardcore
Rock you down to
the floor
Posse saw ya on the border
Jungle jumper under order

Every minute, every hour, got the power
Take a shower, brand stuff
Screaming lord, wickend and tough

I've got the money
I've got the place
You've got the figure
You've got the face
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

I've got the music
I've got the lights
You've got the figure
Full of delights
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

(Everybody...Jumping all over the world)

I've got the position
I've got the name
You've got the power
To drive me insane
We're jumping all over
All over the world

(And once again... Jumping all over the world)

I've got the money
I've got the place
You've got the figure
You've got the face
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world
