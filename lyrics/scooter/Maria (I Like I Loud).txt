Alright everybody
Tie your shoes
Yeah

From the H to the P
On da mic you will see
The people's champ that's me
Yeah
Skibadee, skibadanger
I am the rearranger
Hit them with the raw for sure
Now bun your draw

I was born hardcore
Tough and proud
DJs play the record
Play the record out loud!

Skibadee, skibadanger
I am the rearranger
Hit them with the raw for sure
Now bun your draw
Never, never endeavour
The good weather
Or whether we'd be bound
Only for your pleasure
Yeah

Maria, believe me, I like it loud
Maria, believe me, I like it loud
Maria, believe me, I like it loud
Maria, believe me, I like it hot
Yeah

Right now posse
We're the special guest mixologists

A ritz bits for da hits with the lyrics
With a robotic, narcotic in the pocket
The fire rocket, blood socket, I crack whip
Yeah

Elastic to plastic, my platinum hit
You git, gudda gudda get up with it
Me on the mic, be sophisticated
DJ's articulated, me on the mic
Yeah
Here we go

Maria, believe me, I like it loud
Maria, believe me, I like it loud
Maria, believe me, I like it loud
Maria, believe me, I like it hot---Lyrics submitted by Timo.
