Put on my raving shoes and I boarded a plane
Touched down in a land where the skies were blue
In the middle of the pouring rain
Everybody was happy
Energy shining down on me
Yeah, I've got a first class ticket
Feel as good as a boy can be
I'm raving, I'm raving
I'm raving 'till the sweat has fallen down off me
I'm raving, I'm raving
But do I really feel the way I feel---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
