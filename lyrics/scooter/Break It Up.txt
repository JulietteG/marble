Where in the world, where in the world,
where in the world did I get this hurt?
I don't mind, yeah I don't mind.
If you call me bad, call me wrong,
call me anything but your own.
I don't mind, yeah I don't mind. 

I don't care if you leave me.
I don't care if you go away.
I don't care if you wanted this.
I don't mind.

Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up my love.
If you think that you can't stay with me break it up my love.
Oh break it up, yeah break it up, oh oh break it up, yeah just break it up.

So where in the world, where in the world,
where in the world can I hide this hurt?
I don't mind, yeah I don't mind.
If you call me sad, call me strong,
strong enough to make it on my own.
I don't mind, yeah I don't mind.

If you tear down your walls inside
go for the brandnew ride
but babe please don't tell me so, oh oh oh.

Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up my love.
If you think that you can't stay with me break it up my love.
Oh break it up, yeah break it up, just break it up, oh oh break it up.

Oh oh oh, break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up my love.
If you think that you can't stay with me break it up my love.
Oh break it up, yeah break it up, just break it up, oh oh break it up, yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
