Bigroom blitz

International bitch

It's, it's the bigroom blitz

Turn it up

Shotta got the plan, man
Always like a Grand Slam
Big shot, hole in one
Shotalot is on the run
Crack of the whip, snap attack
Bars so tight front to back
I reach my fate at the gates
God says Shotta you was great

When I'm shopping
And my bad filled with options
So don't ask what it cost
I'm in a Maserati coupe
Goin' so fast that I lost 'em
And my bitch got so much swag
That these bad bitches on us
Ah, killin' y'all, pow

Bigroom blitz

It's, it's the bigroom blitz

Bring the noise

I jack them hoes, direct them hoes
Take 'em home and let them hoes
Go live out their fantasies
They're popping pills, I'm rolling weed
Even got a couple bad bitches overseas

Shotta got the slo-mo
You can call it pro flow
Every shot a straight flush
Shotalot is in a rush
Back on the floor, lyrical madness
On the mic, Jack the cactus
Reach my fate at the gates
God says Shotta you was great

Shotta got the chicks
It's, it's the bigroom blitz

Hee-haa

Yeah

Nobody's hotter than Shotta

Thank you---
