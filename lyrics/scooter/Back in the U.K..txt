Welcome posse!!!
We're kickin' up!
Once again, we have the plan,
Driving you wild, as good as we can!
Don't stop us now, we're gonna make you move,
Raving outside to the passionate groove...
So I wanna check the microphone, I wanna check the microphone, I wanna check! I
Wanna check!
The Rick, the Ferris, and MC H.P... Scooter! Back in the UK!
Yesss!!!
Come on!!!
Somewhere in England, banging the bass!
Join our trip, to this weird place!
Back to nature, where we can be...faster and harder, louder and free!
So I wanna check the microphone, I wanna check the microphone, I wanna check! I
Wanna check!
The Rick, the Ferris, and MC H.P...Scooter! Back in the UK!
BASS!!
We started in 1994!
In 1996, we're still on the case!
Hold tight crew!!!!
Together...no one can stop us now!!!!
So I wanna check the microphone, I wanna check the microphone, I wanna check! I
Wanna check!
The bird, the tree, the cow, can see...the Rick, The Ferris, and MC H.P!!!---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
