On the silver screen

Hollywood and Tinseltown
Pretty girls arriving every hour
See they got this dream
About the silver screen
And it can happen

Now some say in new york
All you need is just enough ambition
And they'll notice you for the things you do
Yes it can happen

Look around
Nothing's in your way
You can start today
And be on to something overnight

In the land of the dreamer
The spirit is high
We reach for the sky
With a never ending party
For the creative mind

Can you feel the beat beneath your feet
Motor city rocking to the music
And Chicago girls
They can rule the world
When ever they want to

Now down in dixieland
Southern boys are calling it a new day
If you got the tools
You can make the rules
Make it happen

Look around
It's America
There's no place like her
She invented opportunity

In the land of the dreamer
The spirit is high
We reach for the sky
There's a never ending party
For the creative mind

In the land of the dreamer
Always on the move
'cause we've got the groove
It's a never ending party
For the creative mind yes

Anything that you wanna do
In the land of the dreamer
Make a wish and it may come true
In the land of the dreamer

Anytime of the day or night
We rock in the USA
Sundown till the morning light

You can make your fantasy
Come alive with each breath that you take
Plant your feet
And reach on up
Why not go for your piece of the cake

In the land of the dreamer (dreamer)
The spirit is high
We reach for the sky
There's a never ending party

In the land of the dreamer (dreamer)
Always on the move
'cause we've got the groove
It's a never ending party
For the creative mind

Yeah yeah wooh

In the land of the dreamer (dreamer)
Anytime of the day or night
We rock
It's America
There's no place like her
Look around

In the land of the dreamer
We rock
Anytime of the day or night
We rock
It's America
There's no place like her
Look around

In the land of the dreamer (dreamer)
Anytime of the day or night
We rock
It's America
There's no place like her
Look around---
