She's your girl ain't that right.
But you're gone in the middle of the night.
And that girl she hangs on.
It ain't cool the way you string her along

I hear talk it's on the street.
It's a dead end with the ladies you meet.
It's a shame the way you start.
Leavin' footprints on an innocent heart

You're gonna need somebody you can lean on.
You're gonna need somebody to love.
It's a cold day when you hear her say. I'm finally free
And it's a cruel world when you lose that girl.
Take it from me, you oughta' take it from me.

It's so good what you got.
Why can't you see that she's takin' a lot.
You don't call why don't you care.
That she's a fool for ya' and you're keepin' her there.

You're gonna need somebody to rely on
You're gonna need somebody to love.
It's a cold day when you hear her say.
I'm finally free

And it's a cruel world when you lose that girl.
Take it from me, oh take it from me.
When it's too late
And the hands of faith they are turning the key,
(oh turning turning turning)
You will love again and you'll remember when
Take it from me, take it from me

No question, i'm your best friend
Wake up or you're never gonna live it down.
She needs you, wants to please you.
You think that she's always gonna be around.

It's a cold day when you hear her say. I'm finally free
And it's a cruel world when you lose that girl.
Take it from me
When it's too late
And the hands of faith they are turning the key,
(oh turning turning turning)
You will love again and you'll remember when
Take it from me, you better take it from me

She's your girl, ain't that right
but you are gone in the middle of the night
It's so good what you've got
Why can't you see that she's taking a lot---
