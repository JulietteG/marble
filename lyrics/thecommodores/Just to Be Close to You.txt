Just to be close to you girl
Just for a moment, well just for an hour
Just to be close to you girl
Oh well ah baby aw

You know I've been thru so many changes in my life girl
Aw I've been up real high where I thought I didn't need anybody
Aw and then again I've been down real low where
There was no one in my life who needed me
Aw and I found that material things I thought had so much value
Aw girl didn't really have any value at all

There was a lonely man
A man with no direction, with no purpose
With no one to love and no one to love me for, for me
Aw girl then you, then you came into my life
You made my jagged edges smooth
You made my direction so clear and you aw woman
You became my purpose my reason for livin' girl

You see you're my heart, you're soul
You're my stone inspiration
Baby oh that's why I'm standin' here singin'
And opening my arms to you
I wanna say child why don't you
Take my hand and we'll live in love forever
Yeah take my hand ooh, we'll be alone you and me yeah

Take my hand girl
We'll live our lives together yeah together
Together yeah together
Just to be close to you girl
Just for the moment baby, just for an hour
Just to be close to you girl, hey, ooh

I've been out there searchin' so very long baby
Searchin' to find somebody just like you
And for some folks it takes a lifetime sugar
To find in this world a dream come true
Why don't you take my hand
Oh, we'll live in love forever yeah
Take my hand girl, we'll be alone you and me
Take my hand we'll spend our lives together,
Together, together, together
Just to be close to you girl
Just for the moment just for the hour
Just to be close to you girl
I need you baby

To make love to be loved by you baby
To have your warm body close to mine
To whisper words that make you feel like a woman
Girl I know our love will stand the test of time
Just to be close to you girl

For the moment baby, for the moment baby
For the moment baby
For the sugar, sugar, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
My arms are still burnin' girl
Ya got me yearnin' for your love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah---
