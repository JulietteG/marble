Listen to me brothers, listen well
Brothers, we've got something to tell
You can't run around being a married man
And taking care of business very well

You've got to keep yourself together
And you dig on what you got
Cause what you got can
Sure nuff mean a lot

If you ain't taking care of business
This you must expect
Love gets slippery when it's wet

You know hanging loose
Can be out of sight
But hanging loose, no
It just ain't right

They'll say he's slipping, kick back
Having fun ain't no good
Leaving homework undone

You've got to do your thing together
And dig on what you got
Cause what you got can
Sure nuff mean a lot

Oh, come on

Ow, ow

Ah ha, slippery, slippery

Love gets slippery when it's wet
Oh, it'll slip away, yeah
Love gets slippery when it's wet
Woo hoo hoo

Love gets slippery when it's wet
Slippery, slippery
Love gets slippery when it's wet
Woo hoo hoo, yeah

Slippery when it's wet
Ow, take care of business
Love gets slippery when it's wet
Don't let your love slip away

Love gets slippery when it's wet
Ah, come on, yeah
Love gets slippery when it's wet
Uh come on and say now

Love gets slippery when it's wet, ow
Love gets slippery when it's wet
Don't lose your doubt, yeah, whoa

Love gets slippery when it's wet
Ow, no way to stop it...---
