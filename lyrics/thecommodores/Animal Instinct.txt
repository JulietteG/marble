On my back
you're on my track

I can feel you creeping up on me.
Such a hungry love on the hunt

Stalking through the night
we're running wild.
In your eyes I'm the prize

in the lion's den I can't get free.
Now we're alone
don't let me go

'Cause you're bringing out the savage beast in me.

My scent's in the air
it's everywhere

I'm gonna be your prey tonight.
I've given up the chase
I'm ready to be tamed

So tonight you better use your

Animal instinct - oh baby
let's set the beast free tonight.
Animal instinct - come to me
I wanna be your primitive lover.

Set a trap
then you attack

bringing me to life with every bite.
A single touch is just enough to stir the animal inside of me.
Lost in your jungle
weak from the heat

I'm gonna be your prey tonig
I won't hide anymore
listen for the roar

I know tonight you're gonna use your
Animal instinct - oh baby

let's set the beast free tonight. . . .

A savage heart
hungry for the touch

in the dark I'm ready for the hur
I hear the call
the call of the wild

every night I need to feel your
Animal instinct -
oh baby
let's set the beast free tonight. . . .

My scent's in the air
it's everywhere
. . .
Animal instinct - oh baby

let's set the beast free tonight. . . .
Animal instinct - oh baby

let's set the beast free tonight. . . .
Animal instinct

instinct

Animal instinct
