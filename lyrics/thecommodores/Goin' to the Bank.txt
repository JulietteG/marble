She knows I want her
she knows I need her

she knows she got my love.
But I'm apprehensive
she's so expensive
girl

just can't get enough.
I'm the one who does 9 to 5
hustlin' for my bread

While she's decidin' what dress to buy

layin' around in my bed.

Goin' to the bank
she got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
she got me
got me.

Drives my Mercedes
lunch with the ladies

she loves the finer things.
What have I created

now I'm afraid to see what tomorrow brings.
She don't know what it does to me trying to keep her in line

If love is iust a big charge account

why'd it have to be mine?

Goin' to the bank
she got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
she got me
got me.

Hello! - Oh hi
can I help you today? -
Yeah
I'd like to make another withdrawal.
- Again? - Yeah
again.
Well
as you know
by now there is a substantial penalty for early withdrawal.

She knows I love her
knows how I need her

she knows I really care.
I can't afford her

I should've taught her I ain't no billionoire.
Gotta get her to understand soon the will be dry

If she don't love the simple things
maybe I'm the wrong guy.

Goin' to the bank
she got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
she got me
got me.

She thinks she saves me money buyin' everything on sale.
But she believes in quantity
now I'm afraid to open my mail.
Goin' fo the bank
she got me goin' to the bank.

Now the girl's gotta look good for me

but this is going too far.
'Cause she won't feel so beautiful when they repossess my car.
Goin' to the B-A-N-K
she got me goin' to the bank.

Goin' to the bank
she got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
she got me
got me.
Goin' to the B-A-N-K
B-A-N-K
B-A-N-K
B-A-N-K.---
