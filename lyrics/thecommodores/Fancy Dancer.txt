Have you found yourself in love before
Tell me ain't it a different kind of thang
So much lovin' such a real good feelin' child
The kind of feelin' good lovin' brings yeah
With your head on my shoulder
My head's a spinnin' round and around yeah
I hear the sound of sweet funky music
Oh even when there ain't no sound yeah
Visions of you my love dancin' in my head
The star in my life girl

Only one thing can be said
That you're my fancy dancer yeah (fancy dancer)
You're my fancy dancer yeah (fancy dancer)

You're my fancy dancer yeah (fancy dancer)
You're my fancy dancer yeah ooh
You're the only thing on my mind
You fancy dancer oh ha

Look'a here the way you move is such a freaky thrill
Baby it's the way you do your thing
I love the way you twist and turn your body girl
You're like a puppet on a string yeah
Shake it baby, shake it baby
Just like a fox strollin' down the block in L.A. oh
Drive me crazy sexy lady
You're so bad there's only one thing I can say yeah
(repeat chorus)

Girl you blow my mind you're so fine
My fancy dancer---
