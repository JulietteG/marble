I thought I knew you from somewhere
Right when you walked through the door
So, please forgive me for staring
It's driving me crazy where Ive seen you before
Maybe it's the white t-shirt that you're wearing
The danger in your eyes or your fingers in your hair
It's a pretty small town, it's coming to me now
Whoa, I just figured it out

You look a lot like my next boyfriend
I can't believe how much you act like him
You and me, we'd be unbelievable
And I'm available
No, I don't think it's a coincidence
I put it all together, it makes sense
Boy, you ain't no fling or a could've been
You look a lot like my next boyfriend

You should probably come over
Tell me your name and Ill tell you mine
I'll probably give you my number
And you can call me anytime
I hope you like red lips, driveway kissing
Cause if you want it baby, that's what you'll be getting
Every night, all of the time
Whoa, I hope that's alright

You look a lot like my next boyfriend
I can't believe how much you act like him
You and me, we'd be unbelievable
And I'm available
No, I don't think it's a coincidence
I put it all together, it makes sense
Boy, you ain't no fling or a could've been
You look a lot like my next boyfriend

Next boy, next boyfriend
You look a lot like my next boyfriend
Next boy, next boyfriend

I thought I knew you from somewhere
Right when you walked through the door

You look a lot like my next boyfriend
I can't believe how much you act like him
You and me, we'd be unbelievable
And I'm available
No, I don't think it's a coincidence
I put it all together, it makes sense
Boy, you ain't no fling or a could've been
You look a lot like my next boyfriend

Next boy, next boyfriend
You look a lot like my next boy, next boy, next boyfriend
Next boyfriend
You look a lot like my next boyfriend---
