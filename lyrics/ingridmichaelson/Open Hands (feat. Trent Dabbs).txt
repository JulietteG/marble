Nobody wants to be the only one that's left standing
Nobody wants to be the only one to understand
And now I'm seeing the way that you're leaving without me

Now go on and drift away
The tide can hold you out
Go quiet now
Go sound go safe
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway
Anyway

Everybody wants the one to make them live forever
And nobody wants to be the only one to say they can't
And now I'm seeing the way that you're leaving without me

Now go on and drift away
The tide can hold you out
Go quiet now
Go sound go safe
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway
Anyway

Now go on and drift away
The tide can hold you out
Go quiet now
Go sound go safe
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway

Now go on and drift away
The tide can hold you out
Go quiet now
Go sound go safe
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway
Anyway
Anyway
Anyway---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
