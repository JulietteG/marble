Do you remember when the walls fell
Do you remember the sound that the door made when you closed it on me.

Do you know that I went down to the ground
landed on both my broken hearted knees.

I didn't even cry 
because pieces of me had already died.

I'm a ghost haunting these halls,
climbing up walls that I never knew were there
and I'm lost 
broken down the middle of my heart heart
I'm broken down the middle of my heart heart heart.
You know you make me a ghost.

I'm an invisible disaster
I keep trying to walk but my feet don't find the solid ground.

It's like living in a bad dream.
I keep trying to scream but my tongue has finally lost it's sound.

I've got to say goodbye
to the pieces of me that have already died

I'm a ghost haunting these halls,
climbing up walls that I never knew were there
and I'm lost
broken down the middle of my heart heart 
I'm broken down the middle of my heart heart heart.
You know you make me a ghost.
Oh, you make me a ghost.
You make me a ghost
You make me a ghost

I don't cry
I don't try anymore

and I'm lost
broken down the middle of my heart heart
I'm broken down the middle

I'm a ghost haunting these halls 
Climbing up walls that I never knew were there
and I'm lost 
broken down the middle of my heart heart
I'm broken down the middle of my heart heart heart

You know you make me a ghost
you make me a ghost---Lyrics submitted by Chelsea.
