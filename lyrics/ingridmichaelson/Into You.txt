Fool, I'm a fool
To believe I can do without you
To repair all the wreckage and ruin

(mmm-mmm)

Close every door
Fall asleep on the floor
Nothing more to this room
But a girl in the jar

Into you
Into you
Can we break down
Let me through
Take me back into you
Into you
Into you

Fight, I can fight
I can punch back the night
If you say I can lay right here by your side

Into you
Into you
Can we break down
Let me through
Take me back into you
Into you
Into you

There's nothing left to me now, nothing left
There's nothing left to me now, nothing left
Everything I ever knew
Oh, it lives in you

Into you
Into you
Into you
Into you
Take me back into you
Into you
Into you

Into you
Into you
Into you
Into you
Take me back into you, into you
Into you
Into you---
