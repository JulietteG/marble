Sitting in the back of the bus
Talking about nothing
We're talking 'bout us
Watching as the world goes hammering on
Hammering on

You say that you've got nothing left
There's nothing left in you to find
You could not ride it out
Couldn't wait it out
Live and then die
You live and you die

No one's gonna wait for you
No one's gonna wait for you

So do it now
Do it right now
Don't waste a minute
On the darkness and the pity city
Men in white and do it right now
And do it right now

Everything will stop on a dime
Everything will crash into itself in good time
Do you wanna beat your own heartbeat
Your own heart, or leave it behind?
Or leave it behind?

No one's gonna wait for you
No one's gonna wait for you

So do it now
Do it right now
Don't waste a minute
On the darkness and the pity city
Men in white and do it right now
And do it right now

I'm gonna get up
I'm gonna get right out of bed
Get out of my bed

You're gonna stand up
You're gonna stand right up again
Stand right up again

I'm gonna get up
I'm gonna get out of my bed
Get out of my head

You're gonna stand up
You're gonna stand up
You're gonna stand up
You're gonna stand up

So do it now
Do it right now
Don't waste a minute
On the darkness and the pity city
Men in white and do it right now
And do it right now
Do it right now
(Do it right now)---Lyrics submitted by Savannah Wilkins.
