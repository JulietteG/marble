Look at yourself
Are you sad? 
Are you sad?
Don't be afraid
It's not bad to be sad

Dust off your hands
And reach into foreign lands
Of your mind 
Dont be kind cuz we're all fools 
Each others tools

When the cracks on my bedroom ceiling
Give me this empty bottle feeling 
I think its time to repaint 
It's time to repaint myself

Try not to peer through plastic eyes
Through plastic eyes
Peel back the rind 
And youll find something kind

You're still you, remember you
Rosy child, strong and wild
With apple lungs
You, you breathe with ease
Floating on the breeze
Floating on the breeze

When the cracks on my bedroom ceiling
Give me this empty bottle feeling 
I think its time to repaint 
It's time to repaint my...

When the cracks on my bedroom ceiling
Give me this empty bottle feeling 
I think its time to repaint 
It's time to repaint myself

Maybe blue or green 
Or something in between
Maybe blue, maybe green
Maybe something in between

Maybe blue or green
Maybe something 
In between
In between---Lyrics submitted by Adriane.
