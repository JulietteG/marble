i knitted you a hat, all blue and gold
to keep your ears warm from the Binghamton cold.
it was my first one, it was too small,
it didn't fit you at all, but you wore it just the same.

i remember the first time we danced
i remember tunneling through the snow like ants
what i don't recall is why i said
i simply can't sleep in this tiny bed with you anymore.

i should tell you
that you were my first love.

so it's Christmas time, it's been three years
and someone else is knitting things for your ears.
as i have come to know, i'll only see you
interrupting my dreams at night.

and that's all right.
and that's all right.
and that's all right.
and that's all right.

i should tell you
that you were my first love.

and it's all right.
it's all right.
it's all right.
it's all right.

we were seventeen again together.
it's all right.
we were seventeen again together.
it's all right.
we were seventeen again together.

i should tell you
that you were my first love.
i should tell you
that you were my first love.
we were seventeen again
we were seventeen again
we were seventeen again.---Lyrics submitted by Kay.
