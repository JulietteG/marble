when i would play my song
you used to sing along
i always seem to forget 
how fragile are the very strong

i'm sorry i can't steal you
i'm sorry i can't stay away
so i'll put band-aids on your knees 
and watch you fly away

i'm sending you away tonight 
i'll put you on a bird's strong wing
im saving you the best way i know how
i hope again one day to hear you sing

you know i'm not so far away
get on a boat
get on a train
and if you ever think you're drowning
i'll try to slow the rain

in two years or so
drop me a line
write me a letter

i hope to find you're doing better
better than today
better everyday

i'm sending you away tonight
i'll put you on a birds strong wing
i'm saving you the best way i know how
i hope again one day to hear you sing

im saving you the only way that i know
i hope again one day to hear you sing
i hope again one day to bring your smile back around
again...~submited by Emily Garcia (find me on twitter and facebook!)---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
