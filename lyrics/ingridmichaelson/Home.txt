Even in the harshest of winter I feel so warm
Even when the marks climb up the wall I still feel small
This is my home
This is my home
Where I go when I've got nowhere else to go
This is my home
This is my home
Where I go when I don't know where else to go
I know everything about this place
It wears your face
Even when my body blows away my soul will stay

Do you feel safe?
Do you feel safe?
Do you feel safe?
Do you feel safe?

Do you feel safe?
Do you feel safe?
Do you feel safe?
Do you feel safe?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
