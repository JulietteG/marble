You lit the fire
Then drank the water
You slammed that door and left me standing all alone
We wrote the story
We turned the pages
You changed the end like everybody said you would

I should have seen it coming
It should have sent me running
That's what I get for loving you

If I had a time machine
And if life was a movie scene
I'd rewind and I'd tell me run
We were never meant to be
So if I had a time machine
I'd go back and I'd tell me run, run

I got your letters
I got your words
I stacked them high and lit them all and let them burn
Your broken sorrys don't mean a thing
You made that bed
Good luck falling back asleep

I should have seen it coming
It should have sent me running
That's what I get for loving you

If I had a time machine
And if life was a movie scene
I'd rewind and I'd tell me run
We were never meant to be
So if I had a time machine
I'd go back and I'd tell me run, run

Oh your love it got me higher
Then it drove me up the wall
But the higher up you go
The further you will fall

If I had a time machine
And if life was a movie scene
I'd rewind and I'd tell me run
We were never meant to be
So if I had a time machine
I'd go back and I'd tell me run

If I had a time machine
And if life was a movie scene
I'd rewind and I'd tell me run
We were never meant to be
So if I had a time machine
I'd go back and I'd tell me run, run---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
