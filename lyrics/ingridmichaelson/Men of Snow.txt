Once I made a man all out of snow/ he had the darkest eyes/ and a button nose/
I told him all my sadness and my fear/ and he just listened/ with a snowy ear//

But when I came around/ the next day/ my friend had gone and melted all away/
I saw his eyes lying on the ground/ and I made a sound/ that was something like/ crying//

Oh/ one day you will go/ away from this/ oh/ one day you will know/ we're men of snow/
we melt/ one day//

Winters come/ my love/ the winters go/ and time stacks up in piles/ like winter snow/
and everything you love and hold so dear/ it won't really matter/ when we disappear//

Oh/ one day you will go/ away from this/ oh/ one day you will know/ we're men of snow/
we melt/ one day//

Oh/ one day you will go/ away from this//
Oh/ oh/ oh//
One day you will know/ were men of snow//
We melt/ one day you will know/ were men of snow//
We melt// 
One//
