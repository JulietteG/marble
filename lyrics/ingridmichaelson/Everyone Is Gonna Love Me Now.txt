Stars are lighting up the parking lot
It came to me the second I forgot
You gotta let me go

If I knew the way to less alone
Then it wouldn't sink me like a stone
Find the words to save
I wasn't born to fade

Maybe I can go away
Where everyone is gonna love me now

I was never right but never wrong
Everybody thought I'd finish strong
But I can get there soon
If you push me to the moon

Maybe I can go away
Where everyone is gonna love me now
Maybe I can go away
Where everyone is gonna love me now

Where everyone is gonna love me now---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
