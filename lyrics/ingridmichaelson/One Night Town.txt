(feat. Mat Kearney)

(Verse)
Living up and going down, everything that we dont know now
Good nights and golden nights seem woowoowo
Youre the one with the Pioneer heart
Youre the one with the brand new start
I feel it coming like woowoowo

(Pre-Chorus)
Headlights, heart break, will go our own way
We got one life today woowoowo

(Chorus)
So when the lights go out and the sun burns down
Im gonna climb this night singin woowoowo
Its the last night, when the sun burns down
To sign woowoowo

(Verse)
Light up on memories, never know what they meant to me
Hold on, let me go, woowoowo
Youre the one with the cavalier smile, Im the one with the open mouth
Bright lights with no regrets and woowoowo

(Pre-Chorus)
Headlights, heart break, will go our own way
We got one life today woowoowo

(Chorus)
So when the lights go out and the sun burns down
Im gonna climb this night singin woowoowo
Its the last night, when the sun burns down
To sign woowoowo---
