 I did what I did for you I did what I could
I did what I dont know how
You did what you did for you you did what you would
I dont know I dont know now

My life will grow my love will go
My life will go, my love will grow

Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you

Everything moves save for me everything will move
I just dont know how to know
But somebody will make me fall somebody will try
Then i will just go and go

My life will grow my love will go
My life will go, my love will grow

Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Go, go, go, just go go go
Go, go, go, just go go go

Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you---
