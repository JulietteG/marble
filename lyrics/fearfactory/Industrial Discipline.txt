There is no dissension,
When lives have been broken.
Enslaved and beaten,
Lies have been spoken.
Pure manipulation.

Whatever soul was left has been erased,
Only a machine remains.
Beaten into submission,
That's what it is to be slaved.

I will not be defined, 
No longer stand in line
Your opposition,
Stand in reflection.
Pure abomination.

Whatever soul was left has been erased,
Only a machine remains.
Beaten into submission,
That's what it is to be slaved.

Undisputed truth in repression,
A paradigm of your aggression.
Beaten down, to believe.
Beaten down, to concede.
Control is key, to suppress me.

Whatever soul was left has been erased,
Only a machine remains.
Beaten into submission,
That's what it is to be slaved.---Lyrics submitted by BlakPilar.
