There is no meaning in your death anymore
The words of your life no longer adored
Your prayers are just lies that fall on deaf ears
Faith has al been lost in our blood and tears
The light that you seek
You'll find nothing there
Your god is just a lie
Void of all meaning
Faith is your bleeding scar
Your god is just a lie
False prophets and promises
I know what they're not
I don't know what god is
I know what it's not
Christploitation is all i see
Your god that cannot save you---Lyrics submitted by Michael Matzko.
