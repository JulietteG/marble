The shadow of your smile
Under the open skies
As I close my eyes
I can feel the wind arise

Were made of stardust
Our lives ahead of us

Well ride The magic bus into the heart of love

I can taste it, taste the feeling of the blue skies theyre for real and were the center of the universe
Just you and I, and I, and I---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
