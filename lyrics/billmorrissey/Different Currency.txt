She took off her apron and joined him in the booth
This wasnt any time in her life to be held back by the truth
He picked up his napkin and wiped it cross his mouth
And shed have done just about anything that night 
To get that ride down south

He told her his name, and then she made up one
That didnt match her nametag and never realized what shed done
He said Its two days to Atlanta if I push it hard each day.
She said I dont have much money.
He said You wont have to pay.

She knew strangers dont do favors and nothing comes for free
Youve got to pay for everything, its just with different currency
He asked How soon can you leave?
She said I dont have much to pack.
He said Ill meet you in my Chevrolet
Im parked around the back.

The sidewalk was still glassy from the afternoons ice storm
And it took her just a second to shed her waitress uniform
She left it on the floor, packed some jewelry and some clothes
Always leaves something behind her no matter where she goes

There was the car just like he said, shining in the light
She could see his silhouette behind the wheel and everything looked alright
Theres only so much snow and cold you can take, so many strangers eyes
Until you have to get yourself back home and fill your family full of lies

He wasnt much to look at but she didnt really care
She was pretty sure his car was good enough to her all the way down there
She leaned back in her seat, just another bird on the wing
He said You know this rides a trade-off
She said Yeah, isnt everything?---Lyrics submitted by Flower Pots.
