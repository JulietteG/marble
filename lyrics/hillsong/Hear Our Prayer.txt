Hear our Prayer

Hear our prayer
Spirit, come
How I long for
Your sweet touch.

On my knees
I cry out
Jesus, Saviour
Behold your child.

Chorus
Like a deer longing for water
My soul yearns;
Only you can fill my deep hunger
My heart burns
My heart burns.

Oceans deep
Mountains high
O my God, I cannot live without your love;
I cannot live without your love.

(Repeat Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by sheila.
