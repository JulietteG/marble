Shout to the Lord 

Intro.
My Jesus, my Savior 
Lord their is none like You
All of my days I want to pray 
The wonders of Your mighty love

My comforts, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
All that I am 
Never cease to worship You

Cho.
Shout to the Lord
All the earth let us sing 
Power and majesty praise to the King
Mountains bow down
And the seas will roar 
And the sound of Your Name

I sing for joy at the works of Your hand
Forever I love You 
Forever I stand
Nothing compare 
To the promise I had
In You..
(repeat intro.@cho.)---Lyrics submitted by Ayco.
