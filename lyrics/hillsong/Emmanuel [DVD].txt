Holy, Holy
I will bow before
My Lord and King
Hallelujah
You have come to us
You make all things new

Chorus:
Emmanuel, Jesus Christ
You'll never let me go
My Shepherd King
You're watching over me
Emmanuel

So Amazing
You have made the stars 
Of the deepest night
Still you love me
and you have called my name
and I will follow you

Chorus:
REPEAT x 2

Holy, Holy
God almighty
There is none like you... there is none like you

Holy, Holy
God almighty
There is none like you... there is none like you

Holy, Holy
God almighty
There is none like you... there is none like you

Holy, Holy
God almighty
There is none like you

You'll never let me go
My Shepherd King
You're watching over me
Emmanuel

We worship you
We worship you
We worship you
we lift up our voices and we worship you Lord

Oh We worship you

We will tell of your goodness and your wonder

We magnify your name
We magnify you Lord
