healing for the wounded heart
like a child i quite my soul
hear your voice surround me lord

Jesus, hold me into your heart, into your heart
and lord my soul delights, and I know you hear my prayer

bow my knee, bow my will
cherished by the strong and the week
humble hearts shall hear you speak

and lord my soul delights and i know you hear my prayer, take me deeper 
and Jesus hold me into your heart, into your heart and lord my soul delights and i know you hear my prayer take me deeper lord.

by your word , lord you promise secure and my soul will live always.
