amazing love has won my heart 
i am in awe of all you've done 
you gave jesus and with him 
you freely gave anything 

amazing love sets me free
from all that would weigh down on me 
you are my strength, my help, my friend 
and my hope- life without end

father my father i am so secure in you 
your perfect love drives away all my fears 
father i love you for you have love me first 
and i am grateful for amazing love---Lyrics submitted by april.
