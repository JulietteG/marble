I'm so amazed
At how you take my life
Love me more
More than I deserve
I'm blown away
By your power to
Change this life once lost
And plant it in you

Refrain:
And who would know
That I was once 
On a road
So far away from you
All I know 
Is that I live my life
To show the world 
Your amazing love
Your amazing love

Chorus:
Your love is so pure
Your love's so divine
Your love transforms 
My soul, my mind
Your love has the power to
Bring new hope
Amazing love
amazing love

I'm so amazed 
Wonderful creation
I will live
To honor you my Lord
You are the gold
Treasure of a life
I will rest in you
And praise eternally
