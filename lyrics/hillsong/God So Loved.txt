God So Loved the World that He Gave
God So Loved the World that He Gave
His Only Son
REPEAT

Worthy is the lamb that was slain
Worthy is the lamb that was slain

He is risen from the dead
He is risen
He's high and lifted up
Heaven and Earth adore
REPEAT

God So Loved the World that He Gave
God So Loved the World that He Gave
His Only Son
Worthy is the lamb 
Worthy is the lamb that was slain
Worthy is the lamb that was slain

He is risen from the dead
He is risen
He's high and lifted up
Heaven and Earth adore
REPEAT

All of heaven and earth adore

God so loved the world that he gave 
God so loved the world that he gave 
His only son---Lyrics submitted by Joyce.
