Verse 1: 

Abba Father how I love You 
Strong hand guides me 
A voice that soothes me 
And I'm coming to Your open arms again 



The more I know You 
The more I love You 
The more I need 
To worship and adore You 
Yes I'm coming to Your open arms again 

1:
Precious Saviour 
My lips will praise You 
With all I have with all I am 
I will love You 
I will love You  

Verse 2: 

Abba Father 

You know I love You 

You know I need 

To worship and adore You 

And I'm coming 

To Your steadfast love again 

The more I know You 

The more I love 

The more I need 

To worship and adore You 

Yes I'm coming 

To Your steadfast love again 

 2: 
How I love You 
How I adore You 
Earnestly I seek Your face---Lyrics submitted by jay.
