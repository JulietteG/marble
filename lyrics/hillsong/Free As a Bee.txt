I'm as free as a bee
Buzzing everywhere
Oooh yeah
I'm as free as a bird
Flying in the air (in the air)

So I am singing
nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah
Jesus I am free
REPEAT 2x

I am as free as a plane
way up in the sky
Oooh yeah
I am as free as a tree
Growing side to side

So I am singing
nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah
Jesus I am free
REPEAT 4x

Number one
I believe in your Son
Number two
I was making me new
Number three
He was setting me free
And I am free indeed
Repeat 2x

So I am singing
nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah
Jesus I am free
Repeat 4x---Lyrics submitted by Allie Kaye.
