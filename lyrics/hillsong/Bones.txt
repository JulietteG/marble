You can take my dry bones
Breathe life into this skin
You called my by name
Raised my to life again	

You can calm the oceans
Speak peace into my soul
Take me as I am
Awaken my heart to beat again

Chorus:
Oh Ohh Jesus
Oh Ohh Jesus
Oh Ohh Jesus
Alive in me

You move in the unseen
You set the captives free
As I stand and sing 
Youre breaking the chains off me

[Chorus] 

Alive in me (6x)

Bridge:
Breathe in me Your life
I can feel You are close now
I can never hide
You are here and You know me

All I need is You 
And I love you
I love you (3x)

Breathe in me Your life
Til Your love overtakes me
Open up my eyes
Let me see You more clearly

Falling on my kness
Til I love like You love
Like You love me
I love you

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by MELCHOR.
