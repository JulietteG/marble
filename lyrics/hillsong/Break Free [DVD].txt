Verse 1
Would you believe me, would you listen if I told you that
There is a love that makes the way, it never holds you back

Verse 2
Who would have thought that God would give his one and only Son
Taken a stand upon the cross to show his perfect love

Pre-chorus
So would you break free, would you break free get up and dance, in His love

Chorus
His love never ends, yeah.
There's no escaping the truth, there's no mistaking its you
God forever we'll get up and dance, get up and dance and praise you
There's no escaping your love, there's no mistaking your light
Across the world we will get up and dance, get up and dance and praise you

Verse 3
Now is the time to take this freedom that has come our way
Offer our lives to see the glory of His name

Bridge
Never ? all our days
We are holy Lord, holding onto all your ways
We are holding on, holding on to all you've said and you've done
We are holding on to your love
Now we will dance---Lyrics submitted by alpha.
