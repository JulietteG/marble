You are the first and last
Beginning and the End
The promise of wonders to come
The future is in your hands
Caught in the light
With all the earth we will sing

You are the author of love
Our freedom is in your name
Embracing the cross meant for us
And bought us to life again
Caught in the love
With all we are let us sing

CHORUS:
God our Hope
And our Salvation
Worthy of all the praise
Be our light 
Everlasting
Great is your name
Jesus the first and the last

Show us the way of your love
Lead us toward the truth
Stir up the fire in us
To live out this life for you
Caught in Your Name
Jesus forever we'll sing

CHORUS

Every heart every nation will hear the sound
As your light breaks through the darkness
And your name rings out
Every distant horizon will meet as one
Singing holy is your name
We sing holy is your name

CHORUS TWICE

Jesus the first and Last
You are
Jesus the first and Last
You are
The first and the last
You are

You're the Alpha and Omega
The Beginning and the End
Our Salvation
You bring freedom
God your Grace knows no end
You're the name above all names
The Lamb that was slain
You are...yeah.. the First and the Last
You are the First and the Last---Lyrics submitted by lisa walton.
