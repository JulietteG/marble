Above all powers
Above all kings
Above all nature and all created things
Above all wisdom and all the ways of men
You we're here before the world began

Above all kingdoms
Above all thrones
Above all wonders
The world has ever known
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
There's no way to measure what's Your worth

Crucified
Laid behind the stone
You live to die
Rejected and alone
Like a rose
Trampled on the ground
You took the fall
And thought of me above all

Repeat all
Repeat 3

Like a rose
Trampled on the ground
You took the fall
And thought of me above all---Lyrics submitted by jared.
