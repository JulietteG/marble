form the moment i opened my heart 
you gave me your love from heaven above 
king of glory, jesus you'll always be mine

lord i love you, It's all i can say 
you amaze me every moment ,every day
my creator, jesus my lord always 

from the depths of my heart 
tot he heaven above 
there i feel you eembrace
and the warmth of your love
I'm not afraid 
cause jesus i know 
you where here 

you're my savior, redeeming grace 
generations will sing of your praise 
be exalted forever more 

great is the lord and most worthy of praise
great is the lord glorified---Lyrics submitted by april.
