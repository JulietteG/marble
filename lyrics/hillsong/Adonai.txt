I lift my voice
I lift my praise to  You
I liftt my hands  
I lift my worship to You 
And I love You more than I can say
Oh I love You more than I can say

Ever I will sing only  You will In  Adore
Glorify my Lord only you will I Serve
For the world will fade away 
Still my song  to You remains
Only You will I adore

Oh I love you always
Oh I love you always---Lyrics submitted by jean.
