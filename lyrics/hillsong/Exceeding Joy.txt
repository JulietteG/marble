I have found exceeding joy
Jesus answered when i called 
His name that has save me
Pure love that embrace me.

Mercy, grace, eternal life 
Bought from darkness through His life 
While lost in my sin He
Raised me and made me live

My soul magnifies the Lord
My heart joys in God my Savior
For He lifts the lowly
And He has done great things for me
I will sing praising evermore
He is mighty
Holy in His name.

I will lift my head up high
Praising Jesus through each trial
Though i have not seen Him
I love Him completely.
