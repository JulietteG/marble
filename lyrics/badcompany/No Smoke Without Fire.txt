Ooh, you're like a book with a page torn out
You can turn from a whisper to a shout, ooh yeah
You come running just as fast as you can, into the arms of another man, yeah

But you can do what you wanna do now, tell me what you wanna say
You can take what you wanna take, babe, take it all away

Chorus:
Oh, there's no smoke without a fire, and there's no heat without a flame
Oh, there's no love without desire, but I won't play your games

Ooh, you've got the looks that can turn a head
You've got a turn that can leave a man dead, ooh yeah
You keep tellin' me our love is alright
You disappear, you don't come home all night

Just tell me what you wanna do now, tell me where you wanna go
It's your life, you can do what you want, baby let me know

(chorus)

Please don't ask me why
'Cos I can't quite explain, I'm like a moth to your flame

(Solo)

Yeah, just tell me what you wanna do now, tell me where you wanna go
It's your life, you can do what you want, baby let me know, yeah

(chorus) - let's talk about it
