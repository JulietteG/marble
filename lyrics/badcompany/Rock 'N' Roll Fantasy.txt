Here comes the jesters, one, two three
It's all part of my fantasy
I love the music and I love to see the crowd
Dancin' In the aisles and singin' out loud

Here comes the dancers one bye one
Your mama's callin' but you're havin' fun
You find you're dancin' on a number nine cloud
Put your hands together now and sing It out loud

Its all part of my rock 'n roll fantasy
Its all part of my rock 'n roll dream
Its all part of my rock 'n roll fantasy
Its all part of my rock 'n roll dream

Put up the spotlights one and all
And let the feelin' get down to your soul
The music's so loud you can hear the sound
Reachin' for the sky and churn In up the ground

Its all part of my rock 'n roll fantasy
Its all part of my rock 'n roll dream
Its all part of my rock 'n roll fantasy
Its all part of my rock 'n roll dream---Lyrics submitted by Ben Brim.
