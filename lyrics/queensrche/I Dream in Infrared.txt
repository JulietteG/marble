As you woke this morning and opened up your eyes,
Did you notice the tear stains lining your face were mine?
Don't you wonder? Oh can't you see what's happening to our lives?
I can't keep this masquerade when
My lonely eyes see your face only at night

I only see in infra-red.
I can't dream anymore. Can't you see I need to?
I can't stand the pain.

You've gathered all my secrets and I don't know who I am.
I even feel alone when you're near
Because you'll never understand.
When we first met I must have seemed a million miles away.
It's strange how our lives have touched but the time is right,
I'll leave tonight.
Don't look in my eyes 'cause you've never seen them so black.

i only see in infra-red.
I can't dream anymore. Can't you see I need to?
I can't stand this pain---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
