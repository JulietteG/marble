You said I'm stubborn
And I never give in
I think you're stubborn
'Cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish
I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out
In way too much in fact
I say we've only known
Each other one year

You say I've known
You longer my dear
You like to be so close
I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs
And you prefer the floor
Walking with each other
Think we'll never
Match at all
But we do (4x)

I thought I knew myself
Somehow you know me more
I've never known this
Never before
You're the first
To make out
Whenever we are two
I don't know who I'd be
If I didn't know you
You're so provocative
I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous
I'm so very cautious
Combining
You think
We would and we do
But we do (3x)

Favouritism
Ain't my thing
But in this situation
I'll be glad

Favouritism
Ain't my thing
But in this situation
I'll be glad
To make an exception
