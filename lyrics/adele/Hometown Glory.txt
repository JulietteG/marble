I've been walking
In the same way as I did
Missing out
The cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel
And strutting my feet
"Is there anything
I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I can call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam
I ain't lost, just wandering"

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world

I like it in the city
When the air
Is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody
In short skirts
Shorts and shades
I like it in the city
When two worlds collide
You get the people
And the government
Everybody taking
Different sides

Shows that
We ain't gonna stand shit
Shows
That we are united
Shows
That we ain't gonna take it
Shows
That we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
