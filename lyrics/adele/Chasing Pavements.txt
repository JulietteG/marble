I've made up my mind,
Don't need to think it over,
if I'm wrong I am right,
Don't need to look no further,
This ain't lust,
i know this is love, but!

If i tell the world,
I'll never say enough,
Cause it was not said to you,
And thats exactly what i need to do,
If i'm in love with you,

Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even If i knew my place, should i leave it there?
Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere

I'd build myself up,

And fly around in circles,
Wait then as my heart drops,
and my back begins to tingle
finally could this be, it ah

Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even If i knew my place, should i leave it there?
Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere 

yeaaa
(talking/singing)
Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even If i knew my place, should i leave it there?
Should i give up?
Or should i just keep on chasing pavements?
should i just keep on chasing pavements?

ohhhhhhh

should i give up?
or should i just keep chasing pavements?
even if it leads nowhere,
or would it be a waste?
even if i knew my place,should i leave it there?
should i give up?
or should i just keep chasing pavements?
even if it, leads nowhere.---Lyrics submitted by alexis.
