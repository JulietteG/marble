Everytime I think I smell that sweet southern rain
takes me to a station on a long black train
I wanna hear the wind blow 
feel the earth move below me
In spite of all the good times 
I gotta rest my soul

*chorus*
so im gone yes im gone... gone to carolina
where i know that i belong
yes im gone...yes im gone...gone to carolina
right where i have a home

everytime i think id see your face in a crowd
it's like a bell inside of me
its ringing out loud
been so high for so long
there's nothing tryin or true
im thinking about comin down
to lay little on you

*chorus*---Lyrics submitted by amanda.
