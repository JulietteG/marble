When you pray
Everything will be alright
When you stay, everything will work out fine
Just have faith
When you pray
When you need a friend
When you need a friend
Just have faith, when you pray

When you call Him
He will answer your prayer
In despair, I know, Hell right there
Just have faith
When you pray
When you need a friend
ON WHOM YOU CAN DEPEND
When you need a friend
BE WITH YOU TILL THE END
Just have faith, when you pray

When you call Him
CALL HIM
He will answer your prayer
PRAYER
In despair, I know Hell be right there
DESPAIR, KNOW HELL BE RIGHT THERE
Just have faith
WHEN YOU PRAY, WHEN YOU PRAY
When you need a friend
*ON WHOM YOU CAN DEPEND
When you need a friend
BE WITH YOU TILL THE END
Just have faith, when you pray
FAITH - - - - -
WHEN YOU PRAY, WHEN YOU PRAY (repeat)*
When you pray----

GOTTA BELIEVE, GOTTA BELIEVE
JUST HAVE FAITH, WHEN YOU PRAY. (repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Faye.
