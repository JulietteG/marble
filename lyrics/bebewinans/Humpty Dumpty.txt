VERSE !
Said youve heard the story once before
bout the famous one up on the wall
Yes, fairy tales they reflect some truth (yes they do)
That sometimes happens to us all.

CHORUS
And so, if ever you see Humpty Dumpty
Or anybody else who whos had a fall
Tell them that Hes mending broken pieces
And Hell be there to fix it all.

VERSE 2
Now, all the kings horses and all the kings men
Yes they tried but they couldnt bring back the broken pieces of his life
Yes which shattered all his dreams.

CHORUS
Oh so, if ever you see Humpty Dumpty
Or anybody else whos had whos had a fall
Tell them that Hes mending broken pieces
And Hell be there to fix it all
And He will fix it all.

If ever you feel like Humpty Dumpty
And if you been broken from afar
Oh, remember hes just and ever so faithful
And Hell be there to fix it all
Remember that hes love, hes loving and ever so faithful
And Hell be there to fix it all

So tell Humpty Dumpty
Tell everybody
Tell them that Mary had a lamb
Tell them that Jesus is Jesus is that lamb
Tell Jack and Jill tell em come off the hill cos Ive found the living one (yes I have)
Tell little boy blue give him your troubles hell take your blues away
Tell old Mother Hubbard, if you trust in Jesus Hell put food in your cupboard
Tell everybody that Jesus is that lamb
And Hell be there to fix it all.---Lyrics submitted by Dike.
