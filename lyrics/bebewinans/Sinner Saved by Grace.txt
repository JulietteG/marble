People ask who I am
And some marvel at things I've done
And then some applaud because of where I'm from
But when we come face to face
They realize I'm just a sinner saved by grace

When you realize who God is
That's when you realize who you are
And if not for h is saving power
I would be lost, without a trace
How may tonight realize, you're just a sinner saved by grace
And by grace he raised me, and by grace he forgave me

I realize I'm just a sinner (good looking sinner) saved by grace

Now when I think about all that he's done
And I just reminisce from where he brought me from
That's when I realize tonight the reason I come
That's to give GOD all the praise
Cause I, realize I am just a sinner, saved by grace

And by grace he raised me, and by grace he forgave me
I realize I'm just a sinner, I'm just a sinner, I'm just a sinner
Oh I realize I'm just a sinner save by his power and divine
Oh I'm saved, through new life sublime
And life now is sweet and my joy is complete
For I realize I am just a sinner save by grace

Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes... Yes...
Yes Lord... Yes Lord... Yes Lord... Yes Lord... Yes Lord... Yes Lord

Oh I realize I'm just a sinner, saved by grace---Lyrics submitted by Darnell.
