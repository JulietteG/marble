[Hook]
Uh, uh, I said it must be, cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Lets take it to the basics
You in the midst the greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margiela with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, aint no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, thats just an understatement
Im early to the party but my Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Lifes a motherfucker aint it? These other rappers aimless
So tell me what your name is Imma tell it to my stainless
You aim it for you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
Its just me, myself, and I and motherfuckers that I came with
Its lamest, niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell them to they face they aint no G
Low key, niggas mad cause Im smooth puffin zig zag
Tell em quit the riff raff bitchin with yo bitch ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yes Im the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And Im so bout it bout it I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin up that dank, blowin on that stank
Whatchu mean? Tell me what you drink, Im on that kissing pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin shit so tell them tell it to my face
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck the dick, motorboat her tits
Im the shit, niggas mad cause Im smooth puffin zig zags
Tell em quit the riff raff bitchin with yo bitch ass
