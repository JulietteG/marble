[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
All I think about is life, nights, sippin' on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little argument, and their fists don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R Kelly hoes gettin' pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sittin' on ice
Fuck broke, tryin' to be rich all life
I could've been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hangin', my top back
Hoes screamin' that Pac back
Throwin' Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, gotta Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white, but my cock black
Purple drink, got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk somethin'
Bounce on me, bitch, hurt somethin'
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth somethin'
So shawty, she a stunna' and daddy, he a runna'
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shakin' it fast and then makin' them stacks
And I'm takin' it back and I'm takin' her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kickin' her out

[Bridge]
How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
So I say

[Hook]
Pussy, money, weed (Yeah)
Pussy, money, weed (Y-yeah)
Pussy, money, weed (Yeah)
That's all a nigga need (Y-yeah)

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
It's A$AP Q, where the bread at?
Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
She fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
Pause a little bit, I gotta little advice
If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga, show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, "Woah"
Can I suck your titties, tryin' to see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't tellin' me no
Sweetie tell me how you feelin', can I feel on you mo'?
She said, "I ain't fuckin' for free", but ain't shit I can't afford
Shit, I'll pay you for it
Now bounce that ass on my bungie cord
Uh, yeah, whoopsie daisy
Put a good kid in your Section.80
Turn a baby into a lady
Now here go the keys to my new Mercedes
Cause shawty she a stripper
All you got to do is tip her
She got ballers with some money
When you fuck them other niggas
Now do A through Z for a G
Panties go down to her feet
Pussy get wetter for me
Smackin' that ass to the beat
Give her that Diggity-D
