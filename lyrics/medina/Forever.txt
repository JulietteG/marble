("For Altid" English version)

Look deeper inside
And you will find a tainted soul.
Sometimes it makes me lose my mind
And I can feel it taking over me like I
Can't come up for air
Because it's pulling me under.
When it gets lonely in here,
I want you. There is no wonder,
Aheeyuy,
Because you're making me wanna change,
You make me open my heart again
And I can't help believing it when you say,
It's you and me forever,

You and me forever,
I'm always gonna be right here.
Me and you forever,
I always wanna feel you near.
You and me forever,
And I'm feeling so alive cause we're
You and me forever.

Go deeper inside
And maybe there's a tainted soul.
But it feels better now cause I,
I've let you in to make me whole
Again.
Nobody shivers, I'm letting go.
I thought I used to because I know
That I can't help believing it when you say,
It's you and me forever,

You and me forever,
I'm always gonna be right here.
Me and you forever,
I always wanna feel you near.
You and me forever,
And I'm feeling so alive cause we're
You and me forever.

(Da, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da.)
Baby, oh, ha, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, na, na, na, na, na.

(Da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da, da, dada, da.)
Now, even if we hurt each other so
And even if I lie, you just close your eyes and let it go.
You're not afraid to let all your feeling show
Cause baby, you're the one, one, one, one.

You and me forever,
I'm always gonna be right here.
Me and you forever,
I always wanna feel you near.
You and me forever,
And I'm feeling so alive cause we're
You and me forever.
Ee, yeah, oh, oh, oh. ---
