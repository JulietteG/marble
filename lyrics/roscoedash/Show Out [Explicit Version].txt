Hook; 
Everywhere I go I, 
Dress up and I go out, 
I got lots of gwalla, let me show you how I show out 
Everywhere I go I, 
Dress up and I go out, 
I got lots of gwalla, let me show you how I show out . 
Gucci, Louie, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas 
I be all up in the mall ballin like its no tomorrow 
Gucci, Louie, Prada, man I'm all about my dollas 
I be all up in the mall ballin like its no tomorrow. 

Verse 1; 
I got lots of gwalla, I spend it. 
I'm a ball-a-hollic like my money , never ending. 
Pockets so swole just like Popeye on his spinach. 
Like Roscoe why you grunt so hard ? I'm like I'm tryna get it. 
And that's just how I do it, hit the mall with bout 10 stacks; but you know that I blew it. 
Hit the blunt, and threw it. That's just how we do it. 
V.I.P. wit M.M.I. you know we gon be stupid. 
You know I make it rain hoe, Goosey by the bottle, blowin fruity like a mango. 
Gone and catch this change hoe, yeah we in this thang hoe. 
It's R-O-S-C-O-E dash, I'm headed for the fame hoe.

Verse 2; 
Show out, show out, show out, all I do is show out. 
Inhale the kushhh, then I blow out. 
SS Camero bitch, watch me as I go out 
Back to the crib wit yo girl and I go out. 
We dont even go out, all she do is hoe out. 
I dont even know her and I fucked er, what you know bout that? 
See all she know is Roscoe got dem racks, now my meat's between her buns like a fuckin big mac. 
And everytime she place her order, I beat er then deport er. 
I get heads and tails like both sides of the quarter. 
Shawty bad, she expensive; so you prolly couldn't afford er. 
But every time I see her its crunch time, like we in the fourth quarter , and I'm gone.

Show out, all I do is show out 
Watch me while I show out
