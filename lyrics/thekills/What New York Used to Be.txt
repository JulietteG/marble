coma comma drama come on
draw it scratch it say it
say it make it to the bottom
ladder climb it drop an
apple off the top it stop it
i don't want to eat it
need it know it force it
feed it leave it be it
just keep it in it's box

WHAT EASY USED TO BE
WHAT LOVE USED TO BE
WHAT DRUGS USED TO BE
WHAT T.V. USED TO BE
WHAT MUSIC USED TO BE
WHAT LUCK USED TO BE
WHAT ART USED TO BE
WHAT YOU USED TO BE

coma comma drama come on
crawl your skin your
mile longer love song
sure it tell the future
fingers crushed and
run em' under water shark
infested sea of secrets
in the open fire beat it
broke it don't believe it
just keep in in it's box

WHAT THE CITY USED TO BE
WHAT FUN USED TO BE
WHAT DREAMING USED TO BE
WHAT FAME USED TO BE
WHAT FAST USED TO BE
WHAT LOW USED TO BE
WHAT NEW YORK USED TO BE---Lyrics submitted by Kasandra.
