Baby save it, we're wasted
I know we gotta slow it down
But when the waves come, you face them
And you know we can't stop it now

Heads up we're in a dead club
Put your hands up and do your dipsy and dropsy
And line up, we're hanging up
We're double sixing it, night after night
Doing it to death

Baby lately the plans we're making
Are the shape of things that never come
Hold your horses, the lights up
Can't feel it coming back around

Listen up, it's picking up
Put your hands up and do your kicksy and lipsy
Your times up, we're hanging up
We're double sixing it, night cause tonight
We're doing it to death

We're double sixing it night after night after night

Doing it to death---
