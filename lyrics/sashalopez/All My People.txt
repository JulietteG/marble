(feat. Andreea D and Broono)

All my people on the floor,
party all night
We want some more,
some more
We're about to turn it on
under the light
We never stop, we rock
we rock we rock we rock
we rock we ro oh oh oh oh
Yes, Sasha Lopez,
wants to see your body movin'
We're ready for the world
Let's go!

Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh

Hey mister lover,
I need a dancer
To make me shake my boody
To make me break the floor
So show me your move
Your sexy ass move
You make me wanna touch, touch
Hey Yeah
