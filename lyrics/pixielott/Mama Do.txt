Every night I go 
Every night I go sneaking out the door 
I lie a little more, baby Im helpless 

There's something bout the night 
And the way it hides all the things I like 
Little black butterflies 
Deep inside me 


What would my mama do 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If she knew bout me and you? 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
What would my daddy say 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If he saw me hurt this way? 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 

Why should I feel ashamed? 
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name 
Here we are again 
Its nearly perfect 
Every night I go 
Every night I go sneaking out the door 
I lie a little more, baby Im helpless 

There's something bout the night 
And the way it hides all the things I like 
Little black butterflies 
Deep inside me 


What would my mama do 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If she knew bout me and you? 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
What would my daddy say 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If he saw me hurt this way? 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 

Why should I feel ashamed? 
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name 
Here we are again 
Its nearly perfect 
Every night I go 
Every night I go sneaking out the door 
I lie a little more, baby Im helpless 

There's something bout the night 
And the way it hides all the things I like 
Little black butterflies 
Deep inside me 


What would my mama do 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If she knew bout me and you? 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
What would my daddy say 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If he saw me hurt this way? 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 

Why should I feel ashamed? 
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name 
Here we are again 
Its nearly perfect 
What would my mama do 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If she knew bout me and you? 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
What would my daddy say 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If he saw me hurt this way? 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 

What would my mama do 
(Oh Oh) 

What would my daddy say 

All the things a girl should know 
Are the things she cant control 
All the things a girl should know 
she cant control 

What would my mama do 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If she knew 'bout me and you 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
What would my daddy say 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
If he saw me hurt this way 
(Uh Oh Uh Oh) 
Uh Oh Uh Oh 
Uh Oh Uh Oh 
Uh Oh Uh Oh---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
