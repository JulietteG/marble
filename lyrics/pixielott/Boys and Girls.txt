I'm looking in the mirror and i think I'm liking what i see
big,big lights shining bright like I'm on the T.V

My heart pumps and the basedrums thumps 
you gotta move when the floorboards jump

something's going on and I think it's going on right now

All the boys and the girls they got it going on
and when beat kicks in you feel it in your bones
and when the basement cracks and the needle drops
you can't turn back and you just can't stop

All the boys and the girls (no you just can't stop) x2
All the boys and the girls

I can see the silhouette standing up against the wall
it sure feels good,feels good 
yeah were gonna lose control

Turn it on make it strong a good beat never hurt no one

Kicking up the dust and were making every move we know
ye-e-ah

All the boys and the girls they got it going on 
and when the beat kicks in you feel it  your bones
and when the basement cracks and the needle drops 
you can't turn back and you just can't stop

all the boys and the girls (no you just can't stop) x4

wooooh ooh 
baby don't stop
wooooh 
keep the vibe up

wooooh ooh
baby don't stop
wooooh
keep the vibe up

Turn it on make it strong a good beat never hurt no-one

All the boys and the girls they got it going on
and when the beat kicks it you feel it your bones
and when the basement cracks and the needle drops
you can't turn back and you just can't stop

All the boys and the girls (no you just can't stop) x3
