I got your emails
You just dont get females
Now, do you?
Whats in the heart
Is not on your head
Anywhere

Mate, youre too late
And your werent worth the wait
Now, were you?
Its out of my hands
Since you blew your last chance
When you played me

Youll have to cry me out
Youll have to cry me out
The tears that Ill fall
Mean nothing at all
Its time to get over yourself

Baby, you aint all that
Maybe, theres no way back
You can keep talking
But, baby, Im walking away

When I found out
How you messed me about
I was broken
Back then I believed you
Now, I dont need you
No more

The pick on your phone
Proves you werent alone
She was with you, yeah
Now, I couldnt care
That you werent aware
Were through

Youll have to cry me out
Youll have to cry me out
The tears that Ill fall
Mean nothing at all
Its time to get over yourself

Baby, you aint all that
Maybe, theres no way back
You can keep talking
But, baby, Im walking away

Gonna have to cry me out
Gonna have to cry me out
Boy, there aint no doubt
Gonna have to cry me out

Wont hurt a little bit
Boy, better get used to it
You can keep talking
But, baby, Im walking away

Listen, I got the emails
I got the text
The answers still the same
Its the way it is
I got to go

Youll have to cry me out
Youll have to cry me out
The tears that Ill fall
Mean nothing at all
Its time to get over yourself

Baby, you aint all that
Maybe, theres no way back
You can keep talking
But, baby, Im walking away

Youll have to cry me out
Youll have to cry me out
The tears that Ill fall
Mean nothing at all
Its time to get over yourself

Cause baby, you aint all that
Maybe, theres no way back
You can keep talking
But, baby, Im walking away---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
