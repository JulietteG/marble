Though it's over now 
and i cope somehow
In the cold winds blow
I hear you.

What is now i dream
For a while it was real
and i cant conceal that
I miss you

But our love was like catching a snowflake
As it reached our hands
It was already gone

Though our case is closed
I keep chasing ghosts
Every time it snows
I see you

And i feel no cold
As you lend me your coat
Through the pale white glow
I feel you

But our love was like catching a snowflake
As it reached our hands
It was already gone
This love was not ours to take
It was fated to break
Though it was beautiful 

But i lost you 
On the way down
Even though i tried so hard
To be with you
To hold on to you with all my broken heart

But i lost you 
On the way down 

But our love, was like catching a snowflake
as it reached our hands
it was aready gone
this love was not ours to take
it was fated to break
though it was beautiful 

catching a snowflake
was like catching
it was catching
a snowflake *---Lyrics submitted by stacey.
