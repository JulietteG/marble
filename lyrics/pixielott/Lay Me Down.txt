You see me howling at the Moon,
It's what you thought me to do!
I'm chasing stars just to get back closer to you!
You see the ashes by the fire,
The only life that I knew
I touched the flame just to get back closer to you!

Show me the way,
I've done traveling too long with the cross on my back
And the hole in my heart
Now you say there's no love to be found
When six feet down and I thought that I'd be closer to you!
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you!
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down
Closer to you!

You hear me beating at the door,
What else you want me to do?!
Ooh, you got me crawling up the walls to get closer to you
Yes you do!

Show me the way,
I've done traveling too long with the cross on my back
And the hole in my heart
Now you say there's no love to be found
When six feet down and I thought that I'd be closer to you!
And I thought I'd be closer to you!
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down?
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down?
Closer to you!
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down?
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down?
Closer to you!

I've done traveling too long with the cross on my back
And the hole in my heart
Now you say there's no love to be found
When six feet down and I thought that I'd be closer to you!
Ooh oh oooh oh oh oh
Closer to you!!
Closer to you!!

Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down?
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down?
Closer to you!
Why don't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down?
Won't you lay me down, lay me down lay me down?
Closer to you!---
