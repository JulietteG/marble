What do you do when you're stuck 
Cause the one that you love
Has pushed you away...
And you can't deal with the pain 
And now you're trying to fix me
And mend what he did...
And find te pieces
That i'm missing......

But I still miss him
I miss him...
I'm missing him....
I'm missing him... (x2) 


And your sitting in the front row
Wanna be first in lone
Waiting for my window
Giving me all your tme

You could be my hero 
If only I could let go 
But his love is still in me 
Like a broken arrow....
Like a broken arrow.


He's the tor in my flesh
That I can't take out
He's stealing my breath
when your around
And now you're trying to convince me
He wasn't worth it
But you can't complete me 
He's te part that's missing 
That i'm missing

I miss him
I'm missing him
Oh I miss him (x2)


And you're sittng in the front row
Wana be first in line
Waiting for my window 
Giving me all your time
You could be my hero 
If only I could let go 
But his love is still in me 
Like a broken arrow
Like a broken arrow 

What do you do 
When your heart i in two places?
You fill burned
but youtorn inside
You feel love
But ou just can't embrace it
When you've found the right one 
At the wrong time

And you're sitting in the front row
Wanna be first in line
Waiting for my window
Giving me all your time
You could be my hero
If only I could let go 
But his love is still in me 
Like a broken arrow
Like a broken arrow---Lyrics submitted by charlene.
