Baby, its over, we both know, lets go forward.
I love you, but in a different way, I love you, forever.
Now that we've come to the end of a story-y and I know that it's gunna be hard for me.
Might hurt some, not too much, but I gotta let it wait.
As the world turns around and we go different places, new things, new dreams, new faces.
Wanna shake up, when we break up, but we keep our memories.

'coz I know you can't stay, so I won't be waiting, anticipating for the fall.
We had our time, baby, so I won't be waiting, anticipating for the call.
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".

Baby, it's better, and I want you, to be happy.
Sometimes people find that it's so hard just to say goodbye.
Then easy the more and the more you try.
So there'll be cheating, better saving, but not me and my boy.
We understand that we're friends and it just ain't working, no point in the constant fighting.
So when we go nuts, for a minute, and admit that we're just not in it.

I know you can't stay, so I won't be waiting, anticipating for the fall.
We had our time, baby, so I won't be waiting, anticipating for the call.
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".

I might lose my mind for a while, but I'll be fine (fine).
Have you heard there's this thing that heals, and it's called time (time).
Clock can tick away, happy will fall in place.
I know, my heart will break, a new me will fill this space.

I know you can't stay, so I won't be waiting, anticipating for the fall.
We had our time, baby, so I won't be waiting, anticipating for the call.
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".
Turn it up, turn it up for the people that say "we're moving on and we'll be okay".---Lyrics submitted by sammy.
