Come on, I just do it, uh
I do it, uh
I do it to you good

Hey, hey
I was sitting all alone yeah
A lot on my mind
I felt a tap on my shoulder
Out goes my eyes
I wasn't in the mood for another man
Telling me lies
But how can a girl say no when you flash that sexy smile
And you say

Wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake it down babe

Hey, hey
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type

In the middle of the floor yeah
I just don't care
See my body so low now
While stop instead
Let 'em take what they want but I'm feelin' it
And it's for you baby
Tell me how can a girl say no when you calling out your name
And you say

Wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake it down babe

Hey, hey
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type

What's your fantasy? (Ooh nasty nasty)
Tell them all to me (Ooh nasty nasty)
Don't you be afraid (Ooh nasty nasty)
Share your nasty secret baby yeah

Wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake it down babe

Hey, hey
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
(Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just so nasty ---
