Soon I will be done
With the troubles of this world
With the troubles of this world
With the troubles of this world

Soon I will be done
With the troubles of this world
Im going home to live with god

Im gonna meet my mother over there
I believe I'm gonna meet my mother over there
I believe I'm gonna meet my mother over there
Im going home to live with god

And therell be no more dying over there
There ain't gonna be no more sickness and dying over there
And therell be no more dying over there
Im going home to live with god

SOLO

And therell be no more, weeping and wailing
There ain't gonna be no more weeping and wailing
There ain't gonna be no more weeping and wailing
Im going home to live with god

Soon I will be done
With the troubles of this world
With the troubles of this world
With the troubles of this world

Soon I will be done
With the troubles of this world
Im going home to live with god
Im going home to live with god
Im going home to live with god---Lyrics submitted by Lpez.
