I saw you last night under
those parking lot lights all wrapped up
in somebody else's arms

From the shadows I could see
and the way it looked to me
you had a hard time
resisting all his charms

Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?

I heard it from a friend of mine
but I guess I knew it all the time
that your love
for me never really did amount to very much

Will the weather never be the same?
You can't see my teardrops for the rain
and my heart hurts
My heart hurts to the touch

Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?

SOLO

I saw you last night, I saw you
out there underneath the parking lot lights all wrapped up
in somebody else's arms

In the silence between the thunder
and when it gets quiet before the storm
at the edge of this love hangover
why do I keep hangin' on?

Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?
Have you no shame?---Lyrics submitted by Lpez.
