Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
until I get there

'cause I'm a ram, yes I am
and I know just what to do
I think I'll drive on
Trying to get next to you
Hey babe

'cause I'm a ram now
You bet your life I do
am a ram now
I wanna get next to you

Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
until I get there

'cause I'm a ram, yes I am
And I'm stubborn as I can be
Won't somebody please
Come on and see about me,
hey hey hey

I'm a ram
You bet your life I do
I'm a ram now
I wanna get next to you

(solo)

Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
Until I get there

There's a ram out in the bush
And he needs to be free
Won't somebody please
Come on and see about me
Hey hey

'cause I'm a ram now
You bet your life I do
I'm a ram now
I wanna get next to you 
Ohhh Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Lpez.
