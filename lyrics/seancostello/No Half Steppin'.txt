Wake me in the morning
Don't let me sleep too late I've got to get up
I got to get out and make my way
I got a feeling
It tells me that I just can't wait, I got to push on
I got to keep pushing every day
I've come so far, I ain't gonna turn back now
Come so far, but I've got to keep movin' it out

There'll be no half-steppin'
I got to keep on pushin'
There'll be no half-steppin'
I've got to keep on pushin' all the time

I've been criticized
And in my life I've made a few mistakes
But don't write me off
I got such a long, long way to go
And I've been talked about
And in my life I've had a few bad days
But don't count me out,
Because there is one thing you should know

I got a light that keeps on shinin' in my mind,
Day and night, it just keeps burnin' all the time
And there'll be no half steppin'
I got to keep on pushin'
There'll be no half steppin'
I got to keep on pushin' all the time

(solo)

You might see me stumble
And you might even see me fall
But I'm on my way
And can't nobody turn me around
You might think that I'm slippin'
But I won't lose no ground at all
'Cause I got that feeling
And I won't let no one bring me down

'Cause I've got a light that keeps on shinin' in my mind,
Day and night, it just keeps burning all the time
There'll be no half steppin'
I got to keep on pushin'
There'll be no half steppin'
I got to just keep pushin' all the time---Lyrics submitted by Lpez.
