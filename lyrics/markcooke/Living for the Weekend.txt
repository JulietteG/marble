Monday I come draggin in
Tuesday will it ever end
Wednesday three down and two to go
Thursday just another day
Friday man I get paid
Im outta here its time to roll

Im livin for the weekend
A little healin for the way Im feelin
Wish it was
Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday, Saturday
Over and over again
Im livin for the weekend

A break from the ol routine
Only two days a week
The other five Im back to the old grind
Works work and thats that
Counting down to kicking back
Get ready set go unwind

Im livin for the weekend
A little healin for the way Im feelin
Wish it was
Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday, Saturday
Over and over again
Im livin for the weekend

	Bass boatin, Bar-B-Quein
	Beach bummin, Bull shootin
	Boot scootin honky tonkin
	I wish it was

Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Sunday, Saturday
Over and over again
Im livin for the weekend
Yeah Im livin for the weekend---Lyrics submitted by Jordan K.
