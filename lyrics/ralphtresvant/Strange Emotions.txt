Go ahead and talk about the past, over and over again.
I got me a good shot, before the wrong shit was done for the last two years.
I think we're really gonna last.  Even though we're not even friends.
She told me fuck you, I called the b's and then we made love.
Girl, your loves got me on a rollercoaster. Up and down, feeling strange emotions.
No Surprise crazy situations happen all the time. 
Cause there's no devotion.
Here goes another argument over something that don't even matter.
Chick, harras me, your tryin to blast me because you know I wanna come up.
I guess it's the crazy things we do, that keeps us so in love.
Like when we argue, before it's over, you bendin over.
Girl, your loves got me on a rollercoaster. Up and down, feeling strange emotions.
No surprise crazy situations happen all the time.
Because there's no devotion.
Girl, your loves got me on a rollercoaster, up and down, feeling strange emotions.
No surprise crazy situations happen all the time.
Beause there's no devotion.
I heard you talking on the phone, to your friend the other day.
About some cat that you knew from while back
and you was wondering what he's doing now.
See I still have friends from back in the day,
cause I knew where this would lead.
She told me fuck you. I told her that's cool.
Then we made love.
Girl, your loves got me on a rollercoaster, up and down, feeling strange emotions.
No surprise, crazy situations happen all the time.
Because there's no devotion.
Girl, your loves got me on a rollercoaster, up and down, feeling strange emotions.
No surprise, crazy situations happen all the time.
Because there's no devotion.
Girl, your loves got me on a rollercoaster, up and down, feeling strange emotions.
No surprise, crazy situations happen all the time. 
Because there's no devotion.---Lyrics submitted by Tequila Gravley.
