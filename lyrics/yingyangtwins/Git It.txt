[Ying Yang Twins - Verse 1]
Baby gotta eat, you betta get right
Magic City Monday, that's the crunk night
The Petrone get a nigga gut shiverin'
Sight for sore eyes, these hoes be deliverin'
Pussy poppin and shakin', brangin' home the bacon
These hoes is for the takin', no clothes that mean they naked
What the hell you waitin' on, your ass betta git it
There's girls in the clubs, ya betta come on wit it
Drop it, pop it, shake it, roll it, whoa
Bitch got a nigga dick sittin on swoll
Losin control off the liquor
Damn I like the way she put that thang on a nigga
She playin with my mind, see the bitch is fine
I can't make her mine, but I can drop her down
You want her to dance, this yo chance
Naked in the club with his prince showin in his pants

[Chorus]

[Bun B - Verse 2]
Damn, look at that face, look at those eyes
Look at them hips, look at them thighs
Got that Apple Bottom, Baby Phat top
Baby girl, you a bad mutha- (boy stop)
Girl, I ain't trippin' and I ain't hatin'
But I been watchin and I been waitin'
Like the way that you shake that thang
Lookin like you finna break that thang
You need to let me take that thang with me back to the pad
Cuz when I put it on ya, betcha won't be mad
You know I go hard and I go deep
And it's all night long, we don't need no sleep
I'll have ya doin thangs that your last man couldn't
Lick the lollipop while I play with the puddin'
Yeah, you said you wouldn't
I knew you would
Don't be scared, it's all good
Go on, git it

[Chorus]

[Ying Yang Twins - Verse 3]
Drop it down low, hoe shake that shit
Lift up for a nigga, get loose wit it bitch
Go down, if ya really want some
Get ya ass on the floor and get crunk
Money comes and goes, so its best ya get ya ass on the floor
Start poppin that pussy, then gettin it low
I got 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 dolla bills
So yo ass can get crunk, show me all yo skills
Keep it real, even though I know you a lady
You still in the booty club, naked, shakin
Hoe back seat door, show me whatcha got
Janga, janga, janga, janga, janga, janga, for a hot bill
Bitch get crunk, let me see ya hit a split
Bounce ya ass up and down like ya ridin on a dick
I came to the club to put some money in ya world
So git it, git it, git it, git it, git it, git it girl

[Chorus]

[Ying Yang Twins]
Git it girl
