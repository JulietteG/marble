I hope that your're the one
if not, you are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun
And do thangs I know you like

I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

Today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
Do sumn' outta the ordinary
Like catch a matinee
Baby, you are the prototype

I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

If we happen to part
Lord knows I don't want that
But hey, we can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track now

I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
Let's go, let's go to the movies

But right now I wanna say
I thank, I wanna say I stank you, stank you
smelly much
for picking me and bringing me back to this world

Hey, hey John! Are we recording our adlibs?
Really? Were we recording just then?
Let me hear that, that first one
When I first started.

I think I'm in love again
Thank you very much....---Lyrics submitted by Cheryl.
