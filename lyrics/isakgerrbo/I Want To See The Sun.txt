As I gaze upon an old and warn down picture, 
a warm reminder moves my body and my soul, 
a child so undefeated, 
a face, 
thats shining in the darkness of space.

As I gaze upon an old and warn down picture, 
of a boy who is starring somewhere into space. 
Im starting to remember, 
Ill find this weary heart of mine Ill be fine. 

I want to see the sun, 
I want to see the sun, 
wanna fly, 
I wanna run, 
just like that little one. 
The sun is shining in my soul.

As I gaze upon an old and warn down picture, 
a magic moment of a day long time ago, 
I'm crying out for mercy for strength, 
to find that golden heart of my dreams.

I want to see the sun, 
I want to see the sun, 
wanna fly, 
I wanna run, 
that child is having fun. 
And the sun is shining in my soul.

I want to see the sun, 
I want to see the sun, 
wanna fly, 
I wanna run, 
like that little sun. 
The sun is shining in my heart.

As I gaze upon an old and warn down picture. 
That reminds me of the child I use to be, 
tears are falling down and, 
I smile cause deep inside I know Ill be fine.---Lyrics submitted by Ike Gerre.
