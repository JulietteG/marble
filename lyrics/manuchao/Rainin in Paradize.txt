Welcome to paradize
today its rainin
in Zaire
was no good place to be
this world go crazy
its an atrocity

in Congo
still no good place to be
them kill me buddy
its a calamity

go Masai go Masai
be mellow
go Masai go Masai
be sharp

go Masai go Masai
be mellow
go Masai go Masai
be sharp

in Monrovia
This (is) no good place to be
weapons go crazy
its an atrocity

in Palestinia
too much hypocrisy
this world go crazy
its no fatality

go Masai go Masai
be mellow
go Masai go Masai
be sharp

today its rainin (x4)
in paradize
today its rainin
Welcome to paradize
today its rainin
Welcome to paradize
today its rainin
Welcome to paradize
today its rainin

In Bagdad
its no democracy
thats just because
its a US country

In Fallujah
too much calamity
this world go crazy
its no fatality

go Masai go Masai
be mellow
go Masai go Masai
be sharp

today its rainin (x4)

In Jerusalem
In Monrovia
Guinea-Bissau
today its rainin

In Jerusalem
In Monrovia
Guinea-Bissau
today its rainin

In Jerusalem
In Monrovia
Guinea-Bissau

today its rainin
Welcome to paradize
today its rainin
Welcome to paradize
today its rainin
Welcome to paradize
today its rainin---Lyrics submitted by George.
