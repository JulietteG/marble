Its all purple blue
On the top of the world, staring straight at a picture of you
And youre standing in the middle, now your face is getting thinner
Now your face is getting thinner

And now shes presently white
Standing next to a friend saying things that you never shouldve said
If I keep lookin at you, will you cut me in two?
Cut me in two
Will you cut me in two?
Cut me in two

I see you purple blue
Were filling out all the life living space, other people like you
And when were standing in the middle, will you break it til you quit er?
Will you break it til you quit er? 
Will you break it til you quit er?
Will you break it til you quit er?---Lyrics submitted by ashly valdes.
