All we are is leaves in the wind
And all of our moments pass us by before they begin

And I know I can't deny
The burning in your eyes
I need a little more now
Rage against the dying light
Burn with me tonight cause I need it

Cause if this is love, baby, I want out
I will light up the sky as we burn it down
I know you can't bear it, but let me say
Cause I know it's better this way
Cause if this is love, baby, I want out

All we are is breath against the glass
Just like the ashes of a fire fading fast

Yeah I know I can't deny
The burning in your eyes
I need a little more now
Rage against the dying light
Is burning me tonight cause I need it

Cause if this is love, baby, I want out
I will light up the sky as we burn it down
I know you can't bear it, but let me say
Cause I know it's better this way
Cause if this is love, baby, I want out

If this is love, baby, I want out
I will light up the sky as we burn it down

Cause if this is love, baby, I want out
I will light up the sky as we burn it down
I know you can't bear it, but let me say
Cause I know it's better this way
Cause if this is love, baby, I want out
I want out
I want out---
