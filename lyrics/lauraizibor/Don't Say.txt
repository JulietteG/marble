Looking back on the years you see
It was you and me but I gave too much you see
And now it seems you've grown tired
And wanna walk away, but you feel obliged to stay
We break up and make up
And everything would be brand new
We gotta face up there ain't no make up
I said there's nothing left to do, and?

CHORUS

Don't stay, if you don't wanna stay
Baby I'll be okay, believe me when I say
I'ma be alright
Don't stay, if you don't wanna stay
Baby I'll be okay, believe me when I say
I'ma be alright

I'd rather be without you
Livin with you is too hard to take
And I know you don't feel the same
Cos it's written, it's written, it's written all over your face
Remember when we break up and make up
And everything would be brand new
We got to face up there ain't no make up
I said there's nothing left to do, and

CHORUS as before

It's so hard what I got to do, oh
I gotta make you leave, for both me and you
And it's so crazy how things have changed
Cos we ain't the same, and

CHORUS as before

I'm a be alright---Lyrics submitted by Claudia.
