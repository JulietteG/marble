Love is patient-caring, Love is Kind. Love is felt most when its ginuwine. But I've had my share of love abuse, manipulated and its strength misused. and I can't help but give you Glory. When I think about my story and I know you favored me because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me, yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me.

Repeat

They whispered, conspired, they told their lies
God Favored me.
My character, my Integrity, My faith in God
He favors me.
Will not fall, Will not bend, Won't compromise
God favors me
I speak Life and prosperity and I speak health
God Favors me. (Modulate each time)

Repeat twice

YES, YES, YES
GOD FAVORS ME

Repeat
