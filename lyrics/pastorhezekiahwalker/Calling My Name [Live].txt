Verse 1
How many times do I go against Your will,
then You forgive me, but yet I still
turn around and do the things,
the things I shouldn't do,
'cause I belong to You
and I know You will come through.

Lord, I know, I take advantage of grace,
here in this Christian race;
but yet I still hear You calling my name.

Verse 2
How many times will it take for me to learn,
that it's only in Your will, I'll ever earn,
I'll ever earn my life's reward;
the honor due to me, life eternally
riches in glory

Lord, I know, I know I don't belong
with You 'cause I've done wrong;
but yet I still hear You calling my name.

Chorus
You're calling my name to come into Your arms,
to be safe from fear and harm;
knowing this but I still choose to go my way.
And You still say, You say, that I am He, 
He who supplies Your every need;
oh, Lord, I've sinned but You're still calling my name.
oh, Lord, I've sinned but You're still calling my name.---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
