I will bless the Lord at all times
I will bless the Lord at all times
I will bless the Lord at all times

And his praises 
And his praises
And his praises shall continuely by in my mouth

I will bless the Lord at all times
I will bless the Lord at all times
I will bless the Lord at all times

And his praises
And his praises
And his praises shall continuely be in my mouth
(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by tracey.
