What i mighty god we serve
What a mighty god we serve
angels bow down before him
and heaven and earth adore him
what a mighty god we serve
what a mighty god we serve
Lead
He holds the winds in his hands
and he is the great I am
He is the bright and the morning star 
and without him I would fall
OH angels they bow down
before him oh yeah and heaven heaven and earth
bow before him yeah
 they adore him, they adore him, yeah oh
