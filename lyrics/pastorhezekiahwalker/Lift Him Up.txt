He is worthy
He is worthy
He is worthy
He is worthy
Worthy to be praised
From the rising of the sun
To the going down of the same
God is worthy
God is worthy
Come on praise Him
Come on praise Him
Repeat 4x
Give God all the praise
Lift Him Up, Higher, Higher
Lift Him Up, Higher, Higher
Repeat as directed---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
