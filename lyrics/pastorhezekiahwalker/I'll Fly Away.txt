Lead:
I've got a home in the sky
Gonna tell this world good-bye
You see I'm gonna fly away
We're gonna be caught up together
To live with Jesus Christ forever
You see I'm gonna fly away
I will be free, free one day
I will be free, free one day

Chorus
I've got a home in the sky
Gonna tell this world good-bye
You see I'm gonna fly away
We're gonna be caught up together
To live with Jesus Christ forever
You see I'm gonna fly away
I will be free, free one day
I will be free, free one day

One glad morning
When this life is over
I'll fly away
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, I'll fly away
I'll fly away, I'll fly away

I will be free, free one day
I will be free, free one day! ---Lyrics submitted by gabrielridgley.
