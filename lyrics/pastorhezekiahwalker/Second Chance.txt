My eyes are open wide By the way i made it through the day I watch the world outside By the way im leavin out today I just saw Haley comet,she waved said "why  are you always running in place" even the man in the moon dissapeared somewhere in the stratosphere tell my mother tell my father ive done the best i can to make them realize this is my life i hope they understand im not angry im just saying sometimes goodbye is a second chance please dont cry one tear for me im not affraid of what i have to say this is my one and only voice so listen close its only for today i just saw haleys comey she waved said why are you always running in place even the man in the moon disappears somewhere in the stratosphere tell my mother tell my father ive done the best i can to make them realize this is my life im not angry im just saying sometimes goodbye is a second chance  
here is my chance
this is my chance 
tell my mother tell my father ive done the best i can to make them realize this is my life i hope they understand im not angry im just saying sometimes goodbye is a second chance sometimes goodbye is a second chance sometimes goodbye is a second chance---Lyrics submitted by fi.
