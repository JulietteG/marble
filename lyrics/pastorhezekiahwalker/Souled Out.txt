I am souled out
My mind is made up (repeat 4 x's)

(1 verse)
Who can separate us from the 
love of Jesus
Not death, or life
Jesus paid the price, now I'm
free from sin

I am souled out ( repeat 4x's)
My mind is made up

(2 verse)
I've come through the fire 
I've come through the rain
But God, He never left my side
He's my comfort thru all hurt 
and pain

I am souled out (repeat as directed)(6x's)

(invert harmony up)(6x's)
I am souled out 

CHORUS repeat 2xs
My heart is fixed, my mind's 
made up
No room, no vacancies, I'm all
filled up
His Spirit lives in me and 
that's the reason
I'm souled out! YEAH

yeah (repeat as directed )

CHORUS
My heart is fixed my mind made up
No room, No vacancies
I'm all filled up
His spirit lives in me and that's the
reason i'm Souled Out!---Lyrics submitted by vian.
