 If in your life you are going through
And don't know really what to do
Just call on Jesus he will see you through
For he knows
Jesus he knows

If there is a trial that has come your way
And you are looking for a brighter day
Just call on Jesus he will make a way
For he knows
Jesus he knows

How much we can bear
Jesus he knows how much we can bear
