Verse 1:
There are so many things about the will of God,
the things we don't understand because they seem so hard.
We try to find the way that seems to be just right,
but the way we choose only leads us further from the light.
But if we can learn to accept the things we cannot change,
and never question God for we'll never know His way.

Chorus:
We must accept what God allows,
and we must never try to tell Him how
to order our lives, He has a plan in mind.
He's the one who made you, created you,
saved you, and He knows what's best for you;
His will is good, it is acceptable, and it's perfect.

Bridge:
There are many things about
what God allows that we don't understand,
But if He allows all of these things to be,
it's a part of the Master's plan.
He knows what's best,
and He won't put more on than you can bear.

Bridge 2:
His will is good, it is acceptable, and it's perfect;
yes, it is (2x).

Vamp:
Yes (2x),
yes, to Your will.---Lyrics submitted by MARIA.
