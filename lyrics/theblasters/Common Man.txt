Ah, he wasnt born in a cabin,
He never fought in a war.
But he learned to smile and quote Abe Lincoln,
And get his foot in the door.

Ah, he knows all your problems,
Ah, he shares all your dreams.
Ah, when he laughs his wife laughs too,
As they ride in their limousine.

Chorus:
So wave the flag and take a stand,
Stand in line to shake his hand.
He says hes your friend,
A friend of the common man

Ah, hes got all the answers,
The good days will be back soon.
Just one more strike and a compromise,
And a hungry child in each classroom.

Chorus:
So wave the flag and take a stand,
Stand in line to shake his hand.
He says hes your friend,
A friend of the common man

Everybody works day to day to get by,
Ah, every mornin searchin for a reason to try.
Aint he the friend?
The friend of the common man?

Ah, he wasnt born in a cabin,
He never fought in a war.
But he learned to smile and quote Abe Lincoln,
And get his foot in the door.

With one hand on the bible,
He swears hes only here to serve.
While everyone says for better or worse,
We get what we deserve.

Chorus:
So wave the flag and take a stand,
Stand in line to shake his hand.
He says hes your friend,
A friend of the common man

Chorus:
So wave the flag and take a stand,
Stand in line to shake his hand.
He says hes your friend,
A friend of the common man---Lyrics submitted by Fuzzy Knight.
