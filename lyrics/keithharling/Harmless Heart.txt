You said you were afraid to trust
So sorry for yourself it must be hard
Living inside your head
And I'm no angel in disguise
I've had my share of alibis
But I was true to you
I meant every word I said
But what's the use when you believe
Whatever you want to

You can run, you can hide
Love will still come to find you
You can turn it away
Keep romancing your pain
You're the best at self-defense
I'd say you've mastered the art
But baby, mine was a harmless heart

In your eyes I'm like the rest
You set me up to fail the test
And prove that you were right
Everyone lets you down
The ghost of all that might have been
Is tapping on your shoulder
But you just keep right on movin'
You never turn around
If you ever do
I hope you'll see that I really love you

You can run, you can hide
Love will still come to find you
You can turn me away
Keep romancing your pain
You're the best at self-defense
I'd say you've mastered the art
But baby, mine was a harmless heart

You're the best at self-defense
I'd say you've mastered the art
But baby, mine was a harmless heart
Baby, mine was a harmless heart---Lyrics submitted by amjad bilbeisi.
