Tick tack on the wall
Screaming at the silent call
Could this be another warning
Higher pressure's got me falling
Into a world I've never seen
Seems so far away from me
I always run away from the storm

Maybe I haven't cried enough tears
Maybe I haven't laughed out loud
Maybe I have been stuck and I'm but
Just a part of the crowd

Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough, to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane

Tick tack on the wall
Could this be my wake-up call
Hiding underneath the sheets
I wait for life to come to me
Think it's time I break this pattern
Systematic becomes a habit
Am I strong enough to believe

Maybe I haven't cried enough tears
Maybe I haven't laughed out loud
Maybe I have been stuck and I'm but
Just a part of the crowd

Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough, to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane

Carry on, carry on, just to carry on...

Nothing's wrong, nothing's changed
Here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough, to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane
