You're disconnected somehow,
Live on different sides now
Divided by the seasons weak
Created from discarded dreams
You let the fire burn out
Into the ashes of doubt
The night grows older day by day
The north wind is on its way!

Chorus:
This winter of love is falling on us
Leaving our hearts in the cold and the darkness
Lost in a frozen dance
Is there still life berried under the suns?
Is there an... of us left in the black sun?
This winter of love!

Will the sun ever come (come to rescue us?)
Put us back into one (put us back into one)
Clouds give way to skies of blue
Will we make it through?

Chorus:
This winter of love is falling on us
Leaving our hearts in the cold and the darkness
Lost in a frozen dance
Is there still life berried under the suns?
Is there an... of us left in the black sun?
This winter of love!

Silent storms have left the...
This winter of love, is falling on us
Leaving our hearts in the cold, in the darkness
Lost in a frozen dead

Chorus:
This winter of love is falling on us
Leaving our hearts in the cold and the darkness
Lost in a frozen dance
Is there still life berried under the suns?
Is there an... of us left in the black sun?
This winter of love!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
