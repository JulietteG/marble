(feat. 21:03)

[Hook:]
I've got to say something, do something move something
Maybe I'll make something and call it praise jumping

Jump jump! Everybody. Jump, jump! Everybody get up
Jump jump! Everybody. Jump, jump! Everybody get up

I'm 'bout to shake something like I'm bout to break something
Maybe I'll make something and call it praise jumping

Jump jump! Everybody. Jump, jump! Everybody get up.
Jump jump! Everybody. Jump, jump! Everybody get up.

[Verse 1:]
Don't judge a book by the cover.
I'm tired of folks fronting undercover.
You're gonna provoke the wrong kind of brother
If you try to shut me down.
I don't want to keep quiet. It's been going on for too long.
Back off, my soul is on fire, and I'm a' move like I want.

[B-Section:]
Get something on your mind
That He did and you know He didn't have to do.
Are you alive (Yeah) and well? (Yeah)
Then show the world and tell

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Don't use the same old steps. Jump to the right. Slide to the left.
Point 'em out if they ain't moved yet. (We gonna have to put you out.)
I don't want to be silent. I've been holding on for too long.
Back off my soul is on fire, and I'm about to get it on.

[B-Section]

[Bridge:]
La la la la, la la
