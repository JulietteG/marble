(feat. H. Walker & Lfc)


You know what....
I been lookin' for somebody...
Not just anybody...
But a special somebody, c'mon!

Can anybody out there pray for me?
Without even knowin' what I need.
Can anybody pray for me, the prayers of the Righteous.

Can anybody out there pray for me?
Without even knowin' a whole lot about me?
Can anybody pray where the prayers don't cease, the prayers of the Righteous.

Do do do do da dup da do do, da da da dup dup da do do, lemme hear ya say!
Do do do do da dup da do do, da da da dup dup da do do,
I wanna hear you say it!

Can anybody out there pray for me?
Without even knowin' what I need.
Can anybody pray unselfishly? The prayers of the Righteous

ooooooo, oooooh

Can anybody out there pray for me?
Without even knowin' a whole lot about me.
Can anybody pray where the prayers don't cease?
The prayers of the Righteous.

Do do do do da dup da do do, da da da dup dup da do do.

I been lookin' for a partner!
-The prayers of the righteous availeth much-
I been lookin' for a soldier!
-The prayers of the righteous availeth much-
I been lookin' for a real friend!
-The prayers of the righteous availeth much-

I can't do it by myself.
-No, no, no, no, no, no more.
-No, no, no, no, no ,no more.

Say it like this,
Do do do do da dup da do do, da da da dup dup da do do.
C'mon!
Do do do do da dup da do do, da da da dup dup da do do.

I been lookin' for a partner!
-The prayers of the righteous availeth much-
I been lookin' for a Warrior!
-The prayers of the righteous availeth much-
I been lookin' for a real friend!
-The prayers of the righteous availeth much-

I can't do it by myself.
-No, no, no, no, no, no more.
-No, no, no, no, no, no more.

Men should always pray.
-Men should pray, that they will not faint.
Father in Heaven, in Jesus' Name

Pray for each other, that we may be healed.
Pray in faith and He will!-

Where the mothers at?! Hezekiah, what the Bible say? ~Where the elders at?~
Let em pray for you.
Is anybody prayin'? (Is anybody prayin'?)
Are you prayin' through the fight?! (I'm prayin'!)
Are you prayin' through the battle?! (I'm prayin'!)
Don't stop everybody on the prayer!

We gotta get back to prayin'!
Father! Keep your arms around us, watch over us all night long!
Send an Angel! Send an Angel! And I won't let go,
till ya bless my soul.

I'm standin' in the need, not just for me.
Touch the Man of God, touch the Woman of God.
SHAKE UP THE KINGDOM!

You got Ya Glory, in my house and Yours!
You got Your honor, we bless Your Name, ooooh.
These blessings we ask in Jesus' Name.

I been lookin' for a partner, The praaaaayers of the righteous availeth much!---Lyrics submitted by carrie chandler.
