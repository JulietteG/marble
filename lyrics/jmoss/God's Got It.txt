- Jmoss
I woke up this morning and i told myself
Not gon' worry about what i cannot help
People dying innocently - haters spreading rappidly
Im not talking nepathy but some things Gods gotta (WORK) 
WOAH-OH
(hes gotta WORK) YEAAHHAH
(hes gotta WORK) WOAH-OH
(hes gotta WORK) YEAHAH
 - Check it out! 
I ain't gonna worry bout' the money in the bank
- i ain't worried bout it
I ain't gonna worry bout' the gas in the tank
- fill me up, fill me up, i ain't worried bout' it
I ain't gonna worry bout' the things i cant control
- it is, what it is
I ain't gonna worry bout' it, all i do is pray about it
- hold up , why?

Chorus
Gods's got it (9x)

- Jmoss
I look around and my hearts a little hithered
The money scream fast and im looking for a blessing
People looking for Jobs - No one looking for God
I know that your hurt but in time Gods really gonna (WORK)
WOAH-OH
(hes gotta WORK) YEAAHHAH
(hes gotta WORK) WOAH-OH
(hes gotta WORK) YEAHAH
- Imma let him do it cause...
I ain't gonna worry bout' the money in the bank
- i ain't gon' worry bout' it, i can't worry bout' it
I ain't gonna worry bout' the gas in the tank
- I know who supplies my neeedds
I ain't gonna worry bout' the things i cant control
- Gods is in control!
I ain't gonna worry bout' it, all i do is pray about it
- hold up , why?

Chorus
Gods's got it (9x)

- when your loosing strength and your confidence 
Gods got it (Gods got it) Oh-Ah (Oh-Ah)
- when your money spent, cant pay the rent
Gods got it (Gods got it) Oh-Ah (Oh-Ah)
- Oh! when a storm is passing over, don't loose your composure
Gods got it (Gods got it) Oh-Ah (Oh-Ah)
- when your down for a while, wanna throw in the towel 
Gods got it (Gods got it) Oh-Ah (Oh-Ah)

I ain't gonna worry bout' the money in the bank
- seen it over and over again
I ain't gonna worry bout' the gas in the tank
- I ain't gon' worry about it cause he cares for me
I ain't gonna worry bout' the things i cant control
- can i hold
I ain't gonna worry bout' it, all i do is pray about it
- ohhh ohh yeaa!
