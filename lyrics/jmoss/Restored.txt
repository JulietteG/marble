I'm restored
And I've been rewarded
I'm redeemed
From guilt and shame
Never rejected
Just reconnected
Now I'm exalted
Because I know His name
[x2]

It's done (It's all over)
It's done (You better believe it)
It's done (God said it)
It's done whoa oh
I'm healed
And revealed
And restored

Yes I am (Yes I am)
Yes I am (Yes I am)
Yes I am (Yes I am)

You gotta believe it

Yes I am (Yes I am)
Yes I am (Yes I am)
Yes I am (Yes I am)

I'm restored
And I've been rewarded
I'm redeemed
From guilt and shame
Never rejected
Just reconnected
Now I'm exalted
Because I know His name
[x2]

(If you believe it say it's done)
It's done (Oh I believe it in my heart)
It's done (The struggle is over)
It's done (And I don't care what they say)
It's done (God said it) whoa oh
I'm healed
And rebuilt

And rebuilt
And restored
