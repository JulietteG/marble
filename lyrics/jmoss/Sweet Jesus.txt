Choir joins in
I love to praise Your name 
I love to lift You up
We bless Your name 
Sweet Jesus

Here's what i love about that name
Demons tremble at the name when i call Him
Mountains move at the sound when i shout it
Thy name is above all names
Every knee shall bow
And tongue confess
Jesus

I love to praise Your name
I love to lift you up 
We bless Your name 
Sweet Jesus 

Sweet Jesus
When i hit the lowest point, Sweet Jesus
And i didn't have anyone else to talk to,Sweet Jesus
But You're the one that gave us the strength, Sweet Jesus
When i was holding my face to a pole with tears, Sweet Jesus

It was You that redeemed us, Sweet Jesus
It was You that restored us ,Sweet Jesus
It was You that restored us,Sweet Jesus
It was You that came to my rescue, Sweet Jesus
I didn't have nobody else, Sweet Jesus
I was feeling lost and left in, Sweet Jesus
Then i called Your name, Sweet Jesus
Then i called Your name, Sweet Jesus
For the name of the Lord is a strong refuge, Sweet Jesus
So i'm running, running and i'm safer, Sweet Jesus
Thank You for my safety, Sweet Jesus
Thank You for my sanity, Sweet Jesus
Thank yo for choosing me, Sweet Jesus
