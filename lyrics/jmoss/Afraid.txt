chorus
Im not gonna be afraid no more
Fear dont live here no more
Not gonna be afraid no more
Pain just walked out that door
That spirit aint here with me
God didnt put that in me
Let the spirit of power and love
and a sound mind, sound mind

VERSE
Waking up everyday thinking what Im gonna pay
With the money I made
Thinking what Im gonna say when the wife ask me
Where the money we saved
Using loot from the gas bill to pay the rent
More loot from the light bill I spent
dont wanna get the phone cause it just keep ringing, ringing


A lot of things thru the mail got me thinking I can
Make it if I use more debt
Get a refi on the crib with the loan man keep saying not yet
I Rob Pete to make a deal with  Paul
Praying that pink slip dont fall
Brother aint got time too much on the grind
Imma let it go, trust God, let em know!!

Chorus

Seems like everyday something worse popping up 
on the news report
Should I keep the kids home from school should I 
Stay away from the Airport

Using fear as a weapon to evoke hate
Everybody think the world aint a safe place
dont wanna use the phone cause it might be
Ssshh! Somebodys listening

A lot of views got me all confused and I  really 
dont know what to think
We got; conservatives, liberals, activists, spirituals
Hypocrites on the brink
One nations deadly call
Results in another nations fall
People aint got time, too much on the grind,
We gone let it go, trust God, let em know!!

Chorus

Ads up thru the roof and I just bought a hummer
and  vertible coupe, 
Tryna keep a little juice in the boost in the trunk but
My loots in use
Jams working overtime keeping hope alive
keeping Moss in the ministry and public eye
But have you thought  if that would happen if the phone 
Stops ringing, ringing


adlibs:
It my belief, Its my belief
Not losing sleep

Racism, terrorism, oh

aint got time too much on the grind
Imma let it go, trust God, let em know!!
