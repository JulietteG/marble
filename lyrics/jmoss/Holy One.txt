Holy One

From the birth of the trees
To the start of you and me
He's proven there's no limit
To possibility
There's safety, healings, and breakthroughs in Thee

Holy One You are, Holy One to me.

Able One

From the birth of the trees
To the start of you and me
He's proven there's no limit
To possibility
There's safety, healings, and breakthroughs in Thee

Holy One You are, Holy One to me. (repeat and end)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
