verse1

Eyes have never seen, minds have never dreamed.
Thoughts have never conjured up, man tries to tear it up
But I know what it is.  I know what it is
It's the anointing.  It's the anointing (oh)
Books try to explain. Movies try to portray.
Novelties dress it up.  Documentaries mess it up
But I know what it is. I know what it is.
It's the anointing. The anointing (oh)
In a world where doubting faith, is running at an all time high
Lord equip me with more, more of your power from on high

Chorus
Surround me with your anointing
Endow me with your anointing
Douse me with your anointing
With your anointing
(Ad Lib) As I come and I go. Use me as I flow in...
Your anointing 

Verse 2
Mountains can be moved.  And demons removed (oh)
Blinded eyes opened up, oh.  And diseases can be cleared up
Does anybody know what it is, that anointing, Lord surround me

Chorus:
Surround me with your anointing
Endow me with your anointing
Douse me with your anointing
with your anointing
(Ad Lib) Equip me as I come as I go, use me as I flow...(repeat)
(Ad Lib) With your anointing
(J Moss) As I come as I go, use me as I flow...
In your anointing.
Oh, as I come as I go, use me as I flow, in your anointing.---Lyrics submitted by Bria.
