I wont be down anymore. 
I wont be bound anymore.
I wont be sad anymore.
I wont be had anymore
I wont be told anymore, bend down, gotta stay on the floor..
cause the floor aint a place for winnersstaying down aint the thing for believers.

Imma be the one still moving. Youll be the one boohooing.
I hope you aint wishing nothing bad on me, cause youre messing with anointed pedigree.
Imma be the one still holding my hands up. Youll be the one still trying to understand,
Why the Lord keeps on blessing me. Why the Lord keeps being good to me.

Even when they tell me no, Imma do it
Even when they say it aint so, Imma do it
Even if they laugh at me, Imma do it
Even if they pass by me, Imma do it
Even if they hold me back, Imma do it
Even set me up for attack, Imma do it
Even if the eye cant see it, Imma do it	
Imma trust God and believe it, Imma do it

Work that..Work that faith, yeah
Work that..Work that faith, yeah
Work that..Work that faith, yeah

I wont be scared anymore
I wont be dare anymore
I wont be passed anymore
I wont be last anymore
I wont be told anymore,  Im as bad as I was before, cause being bad aint a place
for winners, aint nothing good ever comes to a quitter.

Imma be the one still moving. Youll be the one boohooing.
I hope you aint wishing nothing bad on me, cause youre messing with anointed pedigree.
Imma be the one still holding my hands up. Youll be the one still trying to understand,
Why the Lord keeps on blessing me. Why the Lord keeps being good to me.

Even when they tell me no, Imma do it
Even when they say it aint so, Imma do it
Even if they laugh at me, Imma do it
Even if they pass by me, Imma do it
Even if they hold me back, Imma do it
Even set me up for attack, Imma do it
Even if the eye cant see it, Imma do it	
Imma trust God and believe it, Imma do it

Work that..Work that faith, yeah
Work that..Work that faith, yeah
Work that..Work that faith, yeah
Work that..Work that faith, yeah
