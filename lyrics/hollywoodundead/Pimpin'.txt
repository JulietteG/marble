Come on everybody, throw your hands up, in the air
come on let`s.
You know, we keep the party jumpin`
so let`s keep them 40`s comin`

Come on down to the City of LA, where we
We ride with gangstas and the pimpin`s easy
You know how we keep it bumpin` everyday baby
We ride with gangstas and the pimpin`s easy.

When I ride with J-D O G
it`s like okay basically
We get shit faced and crazy
we`re screaming. Fuck the Police
J J just like eazy, let`s smoke these, with Old E and Charlie
We mix it over a hard beat
and run with the UNDEAD ARMY
And you don`t need to see the best of me
the best MC, it`s just the beat
Producer feeds, that makes me mean
that seems to be what makes me scream.
So what up? Let`s roll the town fucked up
let`s tag LA and show love
Yo J-Dog, wait just hold up
take my mic, my PO showed up !

Come on down to the City of LA, where we
We ride with gangstas and the pimpin`s easy
You know how we keep it bumpin` everyday baby
We ride with gangstas and the pimpin`s easy.

We`re six caucasian, hell raisin`
blazin` makin`, zero bacon
Await to drink, to stop to think,
(to call Funny) to ride with me
My pants are so low, I`m sippin` on
this 4-O, rollin` in the fo` door
Producer, me an four ho`s, OH NO !
The 5-O`s rollin`code, I didn`t stop
or try to slow, containers open,
(Funny`s smoking`), I think I`m choking`,
(it`s time to goOH ! ! !)
These midnight killa`s keep it rollin`,
keep the fuckin` mad dog flowin`
Los Angeles we keep it goin`.
Undead is what we`re throwin`

Come on down to the City of LA, where we
We ride with gangstas and the pimpin`s easy
You know how we keep it bumpin` everyday baby
We ride with gangstas and the pimpin`s easy.

I keep on blowin` up, my head keeps
getting fatter everyday baby
On TV, you better listen cause
you know they`ll play me
In the club, you in the corner
while my shit go crazy,
And I got my soldiers in the back
so you don`t wanna face me
And when your girl look up at me
I`m looking right down
And all that yappin`, you know it
gonna get you smacked down
I stick around to keep you mad
while the crowd`s loud
In the City of LA, that`s my home town

Come on down to the City of LA, where we
We ride with gangstas and the pimpin`s easy
You know how we keep it bumpin` everyday baby
We ride with gangstas and the pimpin`s easy.---Lyrics submitted by colin.
