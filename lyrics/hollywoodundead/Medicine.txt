[Charlie Scene:]
Oh no, howd I sink so low?
Aint got the patience, I need my medication
I need to crawl out, out of this hole now
Before the darkness grabs a hold and takes my soul now

[Danny:]
And it just goes on and on and on
On and on and on

[Chorus (Danny):]
Yeah call the doc, I must be sick
Better get me my medicine
Now its five oclock, on the phone again
Think I might need another prescription
Call the doc, I must be sick
Better get me my medicine
Now its five oclock, on the phone again
I think I might need another prescription

[Johnny 3 Tears:]
Oh Holy Ghost, is this a vision?
Ive got 1, 2, 3 admissions
Im getting sick cause superstition
I need a dose, man fuck the fixing
Mama whatd you feed the children?
Pills in milk and nothing to mix em in
Who needs the milk man
I got the Trix and
Another refill aint gonna fix em

[Danny:]
And it just goes on and on and on
On and on and on

[Johnny 3 Tears:]
Another refill aint gonna fix em

[Chorus (Danny):]
Yeah call the doc, I must be sick
Better get me my medicine
Now its five oclock, on the phone again
Think I might need another prescription
Call the doc, I must be sick
Better get me my medicine
Now its five oclock, on the phone again
I think I might need another prescription

[J-Dog:]
Oh no, no, I cant fight it
Even when I hate it, I still wanna like it
Oh no, no, I cant hide it
I aint got a dollar but I still try to buy it
Oh no, no, I cant fight it
Even when I hate it, I still wanna like it
Oh no, no, I cant hide it
I know you dont know me but I know you supply it

[Danny:]
Call the doc, I must be sick
Bitch get me my medicine
Now its five oclock, on the phone again
Think I might need another prescription
Call the doc, I must be sick
Voices in my head again
Now its five oclock, on the phone again

[Chorus (Danny):]
Call the doc, I must be sick
Better get me my medicine
Now its five oclock, on the phone again
Think I might need another prescription
Call the doc, I must be sick
Better get me my medicine
Now its five oclock, on the phone again
I think I might need another prescription

[Danny:]
So call the doc, I must be sick
Im so sick
I think I might need another prescription
Yeah call the doc, I must be sick
Im so sick
I think I might need another prescription---Lyrics submitted by Chris Van Riper.
