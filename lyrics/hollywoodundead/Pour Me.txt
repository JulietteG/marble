Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

I wake up right about the mid-afternoon,
With the sun in the sky but nights coming soon,
I walk to the mirror just to fix myself,
Yeah life gets harder when you love nothing else,
So I pick my pills from the counter drawer,
Pick my self-esteem up off the fucking floor,
I guess I'm a man of no recourse,
As I crack another bottle, got no remorse,
And I'll say a little prayer for the child in me,
I swear I used to be what I truly believe,
That I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased,
So...

Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

People get sick when they watch you bleed,
When you fell from the top, boy you better believe,
At the bottom, they got just, yeah, just what you need,
Well at the bottom, you can't swim 'cause you drank up the sea,
Then we stop and we look up to the sky,
They don't ask any questions, they ask us why?
Don't have any answers, don't know what to say,
Our knees are getting tired,
Too tired to pray,
That's when we laid down the end of the road,
We all seem to walk and I guess walking alone,
And I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased.

Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

Time just seems to go on and on,
On and on,
And on and on,
Life inside a bottle all alone,
All alone,
The bottles gone,
I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased,
Whats life inside a bottle if it's cold?
One more song and I'm finally free,
I'll meet you here in heaven, between the sea,
'Cause I'm not just a man with these broken dreams,
Even I could go to heaven,
If I'm part deceased.
So...

Pour me, pour me, pour me another,
It haunts me, haunts me,
Like no other,
One more drink, then I swear that I'm going home,
Truth is, I don't really have a place to go,
So pour me, pour me, pour me another.

Pour me, pour me, pour me, pour me,
Pour me another,
Pour me, pour me, pour me, pour me,
Pour me another.---Lyrics submitted by Lucy.
