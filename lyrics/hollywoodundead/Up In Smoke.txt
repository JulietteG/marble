(Danny):
So everybody get down like you just got out of rehab.

(Funny Man):
I'm so high
I'm so high

(Danny & Funny Man):
Oh no the bottle's low
And I can't feel my face no mo'
Oh no we up in smoke
And I can't feel my face no mo'

Oh no the bottles low
And I can't feel my face no mo'
Oh no we up in smoke
And I can't feel my face no mo'

(Charlie Scene):
Oh shit damn had a couple to many
Didn't have shit planned, mixing vodka with Henny
Now I can't sit down 'cause I'm already spinning
Acting like I'm rich man spending every penny
So everybody get down like you just got out of rehab
Let's get fucked up put on your helmet and knee pads
'Cause I'm so high I can't feel my face
'Cause me and weed go together like Diddy and Mase

(Funny Man):
So everybody get down like you just got out of rehab
And everybody get down like you just got out of rehab

(Danny & Funny Man):
Oh no the bottle's low
And I can't feel my face no mo'
Oh no we up in smoke
And I can't feel my face no mo'

Oh no the bottle's low
And I can't feel my face no mo'
Oh no we up in smoke
And I can't feel my face no mo'

(J-Dog):
I fuck with a six pack, bong, or a zig-zag
Shit don't puke, here, choke on a tic tac
I walked a line but my eyes are crooked
A couple more drinks bitch now you're good looking
Mother fucking real Hollywood not some B-List actor
I'm faded as fuck, watch me moonwalk backwards
It's a house party, Los Angelas
So fuck the Five-0 my middle fingers are up

(Funny Man):
So everybody get down like you just got out of rehab
And everybody get down like you just got out of rehab

(Danny & Funny Man):
Oh no the bottle's low
And I can't feel my face no mo'
Oh no we up in smoke
And I can't feel my face no mo'

Oh no the bottle's low
And I can't feel my face no mo'
Oh no we up in smoke
And I can't feel my face no mo'

(Funny Man):
Blowing and banging everyday in the low low
I roll slow 'cause I'm allergic to po-po
I smoke the douj when I chill with the cholos
And y'all smoke pole 'cause you're chilling with homos
I sip patron and I chase it with SoCo
Pants so low, got my balls in a choke hold!
Bitches gettin' naked and they're posin' for photos!
And hoppin' on my dick like my shit is a pogo

(Danny):
So everybody get down, like you just got out of rehab!
Let's get fucked up, put on your helmet and knee pads!
'Cause I'm so high, can't feel my face!
'Cause me and weed go together like Charlie and J-dog! 

So everybody get down, like you just got out of rehab!
Let's get fucked up, put on your helmet and knee pads!
'Cause I'm so high, can't feel my face!
'Cause me and weed go together like Charlie and J-dog! 

(Danny & Funny Man):
Oh no the bottle's low
And I can't feel my face no mo'
Oh no we up in smoke
And I can't feel my face no mo' 

Oh no the bottle's low
And I can't feel my face no mo'
Oh no we up in smoke
And I can't feel my face no mo' 

(Funny Man):
Oh no, I'm so high 
Oh no, I'm so high
Oh no, I'm so high
Oh no, I'm so high---Lyrics submitted by Patrick Ley.
