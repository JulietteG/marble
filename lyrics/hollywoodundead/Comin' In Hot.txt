If you got jack in your cup, 
Go raise it up [x3]
If you aint got enough,
Go fill it up [x3]

[Chorus]
I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patrn, 
I wanna girl on my lap and a jgerbomb; 
I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
And I'ma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I drink a fifth of vodka till its gone
And if it feels so good then it can't be wrong
I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
And we be taking shots and if not you nerdy

We only leave a pre-party to go party some more
I'm already shit faced before I walk in the door
This girls rubbin' on my leg, I never met her before
And now shes making her way down to my gentleman sword

Might be the drugs talking or the shots of patron
But these bitches look like models and there ready to bone
I'll take 'em back to my parents house, we'll be home alone
Slapin chicks and have 'em yelling like Macaulay Culkin

She's tearing it up
Yeah shes dancing her ass off
This girls like a Mac the way shes riding my laptop
Im trying to get my rocks off so dont try to cockblock
Ill grab my sawed off and Ill blow your cock off

You know we drink so much 
We getting drunk for weeks
We drink so much goose, 
We turning into geese
Me and my crew flap a V through VIP
These bitches play my skin flute like theyre Kenny G

[Chorus]

[Hook]
If you got jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you aint got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, go throw it up
And if you aint got shit, throw your hands up

Yeah get gone with it
There's nothing wrong with it
Take shots, don't stop, sing along with it
I wanna feel ya bounce
Girl, go up and down
Take shots won't stop
Till I'm passin' out

Girl, get down, you can have more
And you can shake your hips around on my mansword
You're gonna have to rock this house
I'm your landlord
So let your sweat drip down on the dance floor

I ain't tryin' to go home with nada nada
We can hit the dance floor when wanna wanna
Girl, you know you're feelin' me so holla holla
'Cuz everyone compared to me is nada nada

Okay, dawg, this has gone for way long
Can't quit my day job
Till I'm playin' on K Rock
It's chaos, I'm in the club with my shades on
And I'm about to smack that like I'm Akon!

[Chorus]

[Hook x2]

[Chorus]

If you got jack in your cup, 
Go raise it up [x3]
If you aint got enough,
Go fill it up [x3]

If you got jack in your cup,
Go raise it up [x3]
If you aint got enough,
Go fill it up [x3]---Lyrics submitted by Melanie.
