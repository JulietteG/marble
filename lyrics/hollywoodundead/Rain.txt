(Charlie Scene):
I dont mind, no I dont mind, I dont mind the rain
Simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same
I dont mind, that I dont mind, no I dont mind the rain
Like a widows heart, we fall apart but never fade away 
Fade away

(Johnny 3 Tears)
Run like a child do you k:now where I came from?
No I dont, but Im singing all the same songs
Im alone, and youre looking for your anyone
Does it hurt just to know that its all gone?
I can feel the pain in the words that you say
Hidden in the letters that were written to no name
Let me be the hands that you hold to your face
Cause Id give it all up if I could take it away

Buried in red, white, and a side of some blue
Some will die too late, and somebody too soon
If he could come back, well see what it cost him
We had to lose it all, just to know that we lost one

Hi, Im just a shape in the shadow of grates
Hi, Im just a voice in the choir of saints
Oh all the souls that nobody could save
And just like a light, we faded away

(Charlie Scene):
I dont mind, no I dont mind, I dont mind the rain
The simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same
I dont mind, that I dont mind, no I dont mind the rain
Like a widows heart, we fall apart but never fade away 
Fade away

(Danny):
Fade away, as I fade away, away, away

(Charlie Scene):
If I could take it all back
Before the flags were forces to wave at half mast
That was long before my heart became black
Theres no way to make it change or go black
You know that some of us grow old, with no homes
Some of us die in a cold house, with no hope
Still surrounded by the people you dont know, so dont go
Cause its over the time fades your photo
How many goodbyes can fit in a lifetime?
How many good lies can make it seem alright?
What do you see when you look into my eyes?
Or in the sky right before you say goodnight?
I could be the son that stands beside of your bed
And I could be the voice right inside of your head
I could say goodbye and you know where I went
I just wrote a letter thatll never be sent

(Charlie Scene):
I dont mind, no I dont mind, I dont mind the rain
The simple things and subtleties, they always stay the same
I dont mind, that I dont mind, no I dont mind the rain
Like a widows heart, we fall apart but never fade away
Fade away

(Danny):
Fade away, as I fade away, away, away
As I fade away, away, away
As I fade away, fade away
As I fade away---Lyrics submitted by Patrick Ley.
