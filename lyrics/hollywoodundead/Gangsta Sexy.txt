(Gangsta)
(Gangsta)
(So Gangsta)

(Gangsta)
Got my diamond earrings
(Gangsta)
Gonna turn you on

(So gangsta)
'Cause i preserve my sexy
And I'm packing heat so do disrespect me


I love it when the DJ throws my song on 
I hit the dance floor and get my sing along on
I love to spit the choruses when I'm on one
My c-walks to hot, i done ripped my Sean Jean

Smelling so fly , I got the Hugo Boss on 
You got the type of booty I'd like to put my paws on 
We can roll in the Fiesta, just to get our floss on 
Got the speakers bumping straight banging the Thong Song


Got my hair did, go my shit braided up 
Rollin' with Funny Man and he's breaking a blunt
Snatch it outta his hand and now I'm blazing it up
Took another shot of Henny, now I'm faded as fuck

Yo Charlie Scene tell me where you got them shades at?
You know I've had the OG style since way back 
Sitting VIP blowing trees I'm laid back
This bitch is gonna be another notch in my wave cap

(Gangsta)
Got my diamond earrings
(Gangsta)
Gonna turn you on

(So gangsta)
I preserve my sexy
And I'm gonna beat it up
If you let me

(Gangsta) 
Diamonds all up on me 
(Gangsta)
Gonna turn you on

(So gangsta)
I preserve my sexy 
And I'm packing heat
So don't disrespect me

I'm just so damn flossy 
I know what you like 
There ain't no gangsta like me
Ima give it to you every time

Hold up and let me lace up the ten's
I'm only twenty six but so is the rims
I wanna hit the dance floor and thrust my pelvis
I look so good, a million bucks is jealous

So i parked the Huffy, kicked down the kick stand
Payed the twenty dollar cover and i got me a wrist band 
Got bitches to my neck like I'm standing in quick sand
You talk to me twice you better talk to my pimp hand

Got the Laker jersey and the platinum chain
Two Bluetooth's and a pinky ring
Getting drunk as fuck from that Tangeray
Beer goggles on. I'm talking to a grenade

Yo, Charlie Scene tell me how you got so bossy?
It isn't my fault that all the ladies want me 
I just roll with the posse, who's cool like Fonzy 
And known to be flashier than paparazzi

(Gangsta)
Got my diamond earrings
(Gangsta)
Gonna turn you on

(So gangsta) 
I preserve my sexy
And I'm gonna beat it up If you let me

(Gangsta)
Diamonds all up on me 
(Gangsta)
Gonna turn you on

(So gangsta)
I preserve my sexy
And I'm packing heat so don't disrespect me

I'm just so damn flossy
And I know what you like
There ain't no gangsta like me 
Ima give it to you every time

Freeze, at ease
Let Funny Man bang on these keys

I'm about to get it cracking and freaky deaky
All the ladies in the world just dying to meet me
'Cause nothing about me is ever cheesy
I'll get you in the bed and make it squeaky squeaky

Looking so damn fly as I hit the club
Low ride west side, yes we throwing it up
Make my way to the dance floor to burn it up
Now go ahead and hit the chorus and turn it up

(Gangsta) 
Got my diamond earrings
(Gangsta)
Gonna turn you on

(So Gangsta)
I preserve my sexy
And I'm gonna beat it up
If you let me

(Gangsta) 
Diamond all up on me 
(Gangsta)
Gonna turn you on

(So gangsta)
I preserve my sexy 
And I'm packing heat
So don't disrespect me

I'm just so damn flossy
And I know what you like
There ain't no gangsta like me
Ima give it to you every time [2x]

Give it to you every 
Give it to you every
Give it to you every time---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
