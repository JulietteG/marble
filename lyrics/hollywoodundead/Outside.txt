(Danny):
Someone left the door open
Who left me outside?
I'm bent I'm not broken
Come live in my life

All the words left unspoken
All the pages I write
On my knees and I'm hoping
That someone holds me tonight

Hold me tonight

(Verse: Johnny 3 Tears):
Welcome to the world
And all the landing that was wasted
The blood upon your hands
And the wickedness that made it

Seem to scream it all
And the memories get faded
See the exit wound
Dear God what have we taken?

I guess I'll say a prayer
And I'll kiss into the air
I'll look into the sky
Send them straight to nowhere

We all dug the grave
Can't shake away the shame
Can't quiver in the sky
But your shaking all the same

You left us with the guns
And all of 'em were loaded
Teach us how to shoot
But you taught us how to hold them

All the weight of all the world
Is right between your shoulders
Heavy is the heart
When the world keeps growing colder

(Chorus: Danny):
Who left the door open?
Who left me outside?
I'm on my knees and I'm hoping
That someone holds me tonight
Hold me tonight

(Verse: Johnny 3 Tears):
Two sides to every story
Here's a little morning glory
Breakfast of a mirror dying slow
Seems a little boring

Burn it like a flag
Walk it straight into the breeze
Cause there's two types of people
You are weak or you are me

Yeah what's another life time?
Like mine
We all die a little sometimes
It's alright

Did you come to say your goodbyes
To this life?
We all hard a little sometimes
We're alright

So mothers hold your children
Don't you ever let 'em go
There is weakness in your grip
And they are holding all our hopes

Don't you ever let me go
Don't you ever let me go
Don't you ever let me go
Don't you ever let me go

(Chorus: Danny):
Who left the door open?
Who left me outside?
I'm on my knees and I'm hoping
That someone holds me tonight
Hold me tonight

(Verse: Danny):
Someone left the door open
Who left me outside?
I'm bent I'm not broken
Come live in my life

All the words left unspoken
All the pages I write
On my knees and I'm hoping
That someone holds me tonight

Hold me tonight---Lyrics submitted by Patrick Ley.
