Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the day of the dead

We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my head string
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a mad man, the voices keep asking
Born with a soul that dont wanna be saved
Every time I look around I see what a fiend made
Every time I die, I hope they digging up my grave
An undead one like the flag that I wave
Im not afraid to cross on this cocaine sickness
Im not afraid to die, let the good book witness
I ask and get none, nope, no forgiveness
The day of the dead and youre on our hit list
So come all you misfits
Bitch, youre on our hit list

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
Its the day of the dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
Its the day of the dead

This is exactly what has to be done, it happens so gradually
Its like I magically happened to be the phantom that cannot be
Lets this dagger cut jaggedly
While you're gasping so rapidly
Why you brag on this rag?
I see you all laughing so happily
Its okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
Ill just wait here to swallow this soul and tear you apart
And Ive already started, there aint no saving your heart
This is the day of the dead, this is ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, down your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The song has begun, yeah, its hard to swallow
When Im done, I aint done, cause its hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow,
Cause its hell that follows

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
Its the day of the dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
Its the day of the dead

When the ashes start to rise
And the moon falls from the sky
And 1000 candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry
On the plains below the sky
Would 1000 souls still pray for you and I?

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
Its the day of the dead

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
Its the day of the dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
Its the day of the dead

Hold on, Holy Ghost
Its the day of the dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Its the day of the dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Its the day of the dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Its the day of the dead ---
