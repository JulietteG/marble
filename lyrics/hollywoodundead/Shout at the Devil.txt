Shout, Shout, Shout, 
Shout at the Devil x2

He's the wolf screaming lonely
in the night, he's the blood stain 
on the stage. He's the tear in 
your eye. Being tempted by his
lie. He's the knife in your back,
he's rage. He's the razor to your
knife, oh lonely is our lives. My
head spins round' and round. 
[[Psyic]]. But, in the seasons of
weather we'll stand and deliver,
be strong and laugh.. [[Come-
on, Come on]]

[[Chorus]]
Shout, Shout Shout, 
Shout at the devil;x2.

He'll be the love in your eyes, he'll
be the blood between your thighs.
and, it'll have you cry for more.. He'll
put your strength to the test, he'll put
the trill back in bed, Sure you've 
heard it all before. He'll be the risk
in the kiss, might be anger on your
lips. Might run scared for the door.
but, in the seasons of weather we'll
stand and deliever be strong and
laugh, [[come suck this]]

[[Chorus]]
Shout, Shout, Shout,
Shout at the devil;x2.

He'll be the love in your eyes, he'll
be the blood between your thighs.
and, it'll have you cry for more.. He'll
put your strength to the test, he'll put
the trill back in bed, Sure you've 
heard it all before. He'll be the risk
in the kiss, might be anger on your
lips. Might run scared for the door.
but, in the seasons of weather we'll
stand and deliever be strong and
laugh,[[So go]]
