HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!

[Funny Man:]
I'm so icy, like ice cream
All you ladies take a scoop
And try to bite me
Girl I wear you out
Like some nikes, haters steppin' up
Either beat feet or try me
Nibble on your ear like my name is Mike Tysie,
Get you in the ring. World Champ. All fiesty.
Girl hurry up, I'm a shot clock running out of time
Ain't no 3 pump chump, shootin 3's on this baseline!
BOOM!

[Chorus:]
Go on girl, let me touch that body
You know I like it when you drop it low
Hike up that skirt get naughty
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!

Go on girl, let me touch that body
You know I like it when you lose control
Hike up that skirt get naughty!
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!

[Charlie Scene:]
Roll up to the club with a napsack, full of norcos
Lookin fly I'm like Zack Morris with cornrows
Girls look at me like that guy must make pornos
Yeah I'm pushing 30, but I still drink Mickey four o's
Shades on at night, I'm feelin sleazy
Cut into the line like, where the VIP be?
Yeah I'm the guy who talks about his Weenie
Check the list again, yeah they call me Charles P. Scene!

[Chorus:]
Go on girl, let me touch that body
You know I like it when you drop it low
Hike up that skirt get naughty
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!

Go on girl, let me touch that body
You know I like it when you lose control
Hike up that skirt get naughty!
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!

[Danny:]
Cause I'm the kind of guy, that you'd love to be
There ain't nobody that could fuck with me
And all the ladies want me to beat them cheeks
And all you fucking haters, go beat your meat. [x2]

[Chorus:]
Go on girl, let me touch that body
You know I like it when you drop it low
Hike up that skirt get naughty
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!

Go on girl, let me touch that body
You know I like it when you lose control
Hike up that skirt get naughty!
HUT 1! HUT 2! HUT 3! GO!
