Six pack in hands 
Stage dive to the pit 
Hustle the ladies 
Got gorilla tacticts 
I'm creepin through the show 
When I'm scanning for hoes 
Girls got a bag of slippers 
Wanna do the no no 
Get back to the bus 
It's the end of the night 
Get back to the bus 
And get out of my life 
Cuz I got people to see 
Hoes as freaky as me 
I roll it to the after party with my boy Charles P 
Picked up a few friends 
Now I'm dippin with bitches 
Socked the bitch to my right 
I said click it or ticket 
Girl feeling my ride 
Now she's getting suspicious 
This a brand new Miata 
As I'm Hittin Them Switches 
I ride behind Charlie 
As he's poppin a wheelie 
I finally made it to the party 
Now he's coppin a feely 
See Da Kurlzz out front doing tricks on his Heely's 
(Hi guys) 
Now I'm finna get down yelling somebody beer me 


So chug this beer with me 
Get drink with Charlie Scene 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I ain't tryna get drunk alone 
So smoke this joint with me 
Get high off Funny's weed 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I ain't tryna get high alone 

I roll up to the party in my Honda 
Funny followed me is his Madza Miata 
Damn what a balla 
Top down what a primadonna 
The spinners that he bought 
Straight out of Auto Zone for 30 dollas 
Money we have nadda 
Lets go inside i'll folla 
They didn't let us in 
So we hopped a 
wall but I dropped ya 
Thats when I lost ya 
I didn't try ta call ya 
I ran into a crowd of Celebrities and Papa-- 
razzi and they shot a 
Pictures of me and Dennis Harper 
Now I needa doctor 
Yo little John-ya 
Crunk juice and Vodka 
Is turning me into a monster 
One more shot and imma gon-ah 
(Funnyman- But Charlie, i saw ya stick your dick in the salsa) 
I don't want no drama 
I'd rather have my anaconda 
Deep throated by Piranas 


So take these pills with me 
Got'em from J-D-O-G 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I don't wanna get high alone 
So take this Ecstasy 
They must be J3T's 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I ain't trya get down alone 

hey, who's going to the rave tonight, huh 
(hey, we'll see some girls there, it be rave poppin) 
oh, odela fool. 
Who's wants to get pussy 


So chug this beer with me 
Get drink with Charlie Scene 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I ain't tryna get drunk alone 
So smoke this joint with me 
Get high off Funny's weed 
Sense this urgency 
Cause I ain't tryna get high alone---Lyrics submitted by Claire.
