Chorus:
Now i can see your pain, i'm sorry (goodbye)
i cried so, now i can see your pain, i'm sorry (goodbye)
i cried tonight

the necks of this youth 
with their necks through this noose
were told lies like its truth and we suspect that its you
so you strap them with the AK
its motherfucking mayday
they swear i'm fucking crazy
ain't nothing gonna save me.
i'm breaking, i feel it
i'm naked i'm kneeling
i'm shaking i reeling
my god i keep bleeding!
i watched the word die for crimson eyes.
i cry it turns to night.
i die i see the light
and now i'll say goodbye!

Now i can see your pain, i'm sorry (goodbye)
i cried so, now i can see your pain, i'm sorry (goodbye)
i cried tonight

if i could take all this pain away
use the rage of our youth today 
whose to say that its you to blame 
it's the people above you
the ones who say that they love you
look what the world has come to
so now it's time to say FUCK YOU!
if you care then they drug you
when no ones there when they numb you
fill you with terror and crush you
pretend to care as they shove you
so you look to me to find the truth 
and what i say is what you do
but everyone you look up to is really as fucked up as you
time is getting shorter
with these enforcers orders,
and we get blamed and pushed around, 
whose the fucking villain now?

Now i can see your pain, i'm sorry (goodbye)
i cried so, now i can see your pain, i'm sorry (goodbye)
i cried tonight

Cant stop now, were so close now.
cos these times are almost over.
i wont give up, so god save us.
feels like were getting closer. 

We cant stop now, were so close now.
cos these times are almost over.
i wont give up, so god save us.
woah!

Now i can see your pain, i'm sorry (goodbye)
i cried so, now i can see your pain, i'm sorry (goodbye)
i cried tonight 

Goodbye! i cried tonight (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Grace Sommers.
