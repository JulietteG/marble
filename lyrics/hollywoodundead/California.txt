Get, get, get drunk lets
Get, get, get drunk lets
Get, get, get drunk lets
Get, get, get

California show me love
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California throw it up
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California show me love
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California, so high we'll ride all night

Comin' straight outta Cali (what! )
The 818 valley (what! )
323! Fuckin' horse night alley(?)
And from Highland to Clayton, all these bitches are hatin'
'Cause the shit that we're saying, is the shit that they're playin'
If we don't make it we'll take it
If ain't real then we'll fake it
Open your mouth and I'll break it; don't give a fuck it you hate it! 
We're looking for the 6 chicks, down with the 6 dicks
Rollin' all day, gettin' buzzed it's ridiculous
Horny like the sickness
Quickies with the quickness
Pussy like it's business
Work it like it's fitness
Listen while I spit this, gamin' all these bitches
Now I'm gonna hit this, and fuck until I'm dickless! 

California show me love
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California throw it up
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California show me love
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California, so high we'll ride all night

Let's get girls in the front and the sluts in the back
Let's push 'em all together and put 'em on our laps
Alcohol and drugs and California love
They got me ready to party on this sweetened Bacardi
From the north to the south, this state's all about
Silicon lips and all the fake tits! 
California girls; best in the world
Best in the back seat; so lets get fuckin' nasty! 
I'm a pirate on the streets of C-California
Movin' and cruisin', we're boozin' all night to the mornin'
So from dust 'till dawn, you know Undead is always on
Hit it once like a bomb
Hit it twice and then I'm gone! 

California show me love
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California throw it up
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California show me love
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California, all night 'till the morning

You don't wanna step on us, we leave the club fucked up
Come on down and say "What's up?"
Don't front 'cause I ain't buzzed
Johnny's here to fuck you up
JDOG pass the 40 up
You know I'll be here all night
And Undead 'till the day we die

California show me love
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California throw it up
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California show me love
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
California, all night 'till the morning

Get, get, get drunk let's
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
Get, get, get, drunk let's
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up
Get, get, get, drunk let's
Get buzzed; let's get fucked up

California, so high we'll ride all night!---Lyrics submitted by cody.
