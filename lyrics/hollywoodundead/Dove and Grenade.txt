[J-Dog]
From the front to the back we attack,
That's when the sky turns black.
Divided by all our own means,
Divided by lines you can't see.
We've raised our fists, you know we exist,
You're scared of us because we influence your kids.
and you paved the way that way that we walk,
and you dug your grave it won't stop.

[Funny Man]
You know we got the plan hold up, pointing at your head,
Laying on your back but you're better off dead.
Got the army with me, with the dove and grenade,
Got the pin pulled out it's a fucking air raid.
We ride like tanks and we bite like snakes,
Search and destroy we do what ever it takes.
I'm Undead
When the shells hit the floor,
Yeah undead,
Let's start a war

[Chorus/Deuce]
I'm the man and I'm the man
and everybody out there knows that I'm the baddest,
I'm the baddest of em all beneath this mask,
Cause I'm the man and I'm the man
and everybody out there knows that I'm the baddest,
I'm the baddest of em all and you just mad
and it's so sad

[J3T]
The next time you breathe you better think of me,
and your prayers thank god for the mercy of me.
An eye for an eye but I don't need to see,
Who needs eyes mother fucker I can feel you bleed.
I got a plaque in the attic and the bitch is gold,
Not another word till I'm platinum no, our critics talk shit

Watch a bitch get rolled,
I only say bitch when I see a bitch so,

[Charlie Scene]
It's too late,
there's no wait it's doomsday.
This crusades been erased by two-face,
So touche.
You've gone past your due date, do you crave,
Scene giving you a grenade to pay.
Down on your knees crying for help,
and you're just gonna be another notch on the belt.
I'm Undead
and you can only blame yourself
Yeah Undead
and I'ma make it rain in hell.

[Chorus/Deuce]
I'm the man and I'm the man
and everybody out there knows that I'm the baddest,
I'm the baddest of em all and you just mad
Cause I'm the man and I'm the man
and everybody out there knows that I'm the baddest,
I'm the baddest of em all and you just mad
and it's so sad
