(J3T) 
Welcome, to the world you see; 
An AK with a couple magazines.
Whose blood it is don't matter to me; 
Scatter the ashes over seven seas! 
That sickness, that feeling inside you; 
That's weakness, don't let it divide you; 
Keep this, that feeling of pride too; 
Digging up bones, but you bury the truth! 
Children... Hypocrisy, 
That's what I give, you can take it from me; 
If you don't  won't live too see; 
One last act of tragedy! 
No mother's heart can make me humble; 
No life lost can make me stumble; 
Our empire will never crumble! 

(Danny)
We did it for the glory! The glory. The glory. Only the glory! 
We lived and died a story! It's our story! All for the glory! 

(J3T)
Bullets, begin to strip.
A man of reason, he's a man of sin! 
A man of treason and the ones who live; 
They'll take what you got, what you got to give! 
Then up higher; 
A trial by fire! 
They're liars; 
Like funeral pyres! 
A letter to a mother from across the sea.
A son in a box, buried beneath! 
For whom the bell told, the tolls for thee; 
For whom they smile when they put you to sleep! 
A deal with the devil is a deal with me; 
And that deal is forever so long as you breath! 
Go forth child, make us proud.
Honor is yours, UNDERGROUND! 
Though we love you we lay you down! 

(Danny)  
We did it for the glory! The glory. The glory. Only the glory! 
We lived and died a story! It's our story! All for the glory! 


(Danny/J-Dog) 
Nobody RUNS! Nobody RUNS! Nobody RUNS or makes it out alive! 
Nobody RUNS! Nobody RUNS! Nobody RUNS or makes it out alive! 
Hearts beating faster, running to the front LINES! 
Nobody RUNS or makes it out alive! 
Look up to heaven as it rains from the SKY! 
Nobody RUNS or makes it out ALIVE! 
Out alive... 

(Danny/HU) 
Because we did it for the glory! The glory! Only the glory! 
We lived and died a story! It's a story! All for the glory! 
The glory! (RUN! ) The glory! (RUN! ) The glory! (RUN! )
We did it for the glory! (RUN! ) The glory! (RUN! ) For the glory!---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
