I'm holding on so tightly now.
my insides scream so loud.
They keep watchin', watchin' me drown.
how did it come to this?

How did it come to this? How did I know it was you?
It was a bad dream,
asphyxiated, watch me bleed. 
The life support was cut,
The knot was too tight.
They push and pull me, but they know they'll never win.

[Chorus]
Throw it all away.
Throw it all away.
I keep on screaming, but there's really nothing left to say.
So get away, just get away.
I keep on fighting, but I can't keep going on this way.

Can't keep going, can't keep going on like this.
They make me sick and I get so sick of it.
'Cause they won't let me, they won't let me breath.
Why can't they let me be?

Why can't they let me be?  Why don't I know what I am?
I force this hate into my heart 'cause it's my only friend.
My lips are sewn shut. 
I watch myself bleed.
They push and pull me and its killing me within.

[Chorus]

I can't keep going, can't keep going on this way.
I can't keep going, can't keep going on this way.

My heartbeat stumbles and my backbone crumbles.
I feel, is it real, as the lynch mob doubles.
They want blood and they'll kill for it,
drain me and they'll kneel for it.

Burn me at the stake, met the devil, made the deal for it.
Guillotine dreams, yeah, their guillotine gleams.
The blood of their enemies, watching while they sentence me.
Sentencing ceased, sentence deceased,
and watch them bask in the glory of their holy disease.

[Chorus]

I keep on running, I keep on running,
I keep on running, but I can't keep going on this way.

I keep on running, I keep on running,
I keep on running, but I can't keep going on this way.---Lyrics submitted by Jared.
