(Danny)
We don't Apologize 
And that's just the way it is 
But we can harmonzie 
Even if we sound like shit.
Don't try to criticize
You Bitches better pleade the fifth 
We've been idolized 
Role models for all the kids.

(J-Dog)
You heard us before but that was just a little sample.
We're back for more here to set a worst exsample. 
Chop it up white stuff let's begin.
Big wolves linin' up and scorin' little pigs.
Still Drunk and we're doin' it again 
With a huff and a puff I'm Blowin birds on your shit.
Learn it out pinch black grin still white skin.
You know I'm hard to kill but real Im movin' in
I'm puttin' 22 down while I'm pukin' up blood
You know I'm here to stay well fuck I'm gonna die young.
Now me posse's gettin' big and my posse's getting bigger. 
It's 188 minus one you know th figure. 

(Danny) 
 We don't Apologize 
And that's just the way it is 
But we can harmonzie 
Even if we sound like shit.
Don't try to criticize
You Bitches better pleade the fifth 
We've been idolized 
Role models for all the kids.

(Charlie Scene) 
It's easy to be drunk when it's hard to be sober.
Imma steal your leased rover and pull police over. 
I'm a mean smoker who reaks of weed oder. 
Certified street soldier devil on your teens shoulder. 
Don't invite Scene over he pees at sleep overs.
He asked your sister out so that he couldn't cheat on her.
What a creep loner, shit i couldn't sink lower.
You got a mean Boner from a Charlie Scene poster. 
If I'm poppin' a wheelie it's cause I'm jackin your bike.
Got my middle fingure rasied as I'm runnin' red lights. 
I'm known to punch 'em in the dick at the end of a fight.
And i never say I'm sorry at the end of the night.

(Johnny 3 Tears) 
So many dollars stuffed in my wallet
Chain so bling Yeah you know that I'm balla.
We can take the cuz your parents don't wanna. 
They roll there blunts with your Marijuana.
How can i run when the pig got chopper 
I got a gun but they got a lotta.
God Bless a catholic forgive me father. 
Now what's a man to do when another holds a Bible 
A lot of kids suing me holdin' me liable
Reflections of a kid and they call him Suicidal 
Dead beat such a sinner but we call him a child. 
How can you blame him a play ground they're dealin 
The mother still buyin' and the father still preachin'
And now it's up to me cause no one's gonna teach him 
Now nobody, Nobody need 'em. 

(Danny) 
 We don't Apologize 
And that's just the way it is 
But we can harmonzie 
Even if we sound like shit.
Don't try to criticize
You Bitches better pleade the fifth 
We've been idolized 
Role models for all the kids.---Lyrics submitted by kaylyn.
