Can't stand waitin',
can't still waitin' on you,
can't stand waitin', waitin' on you.
You got to let me know,
are you serious about it,
you got to let me know,
can I count on you ?

High society, high society girl
livin' in a high society, high society world.

High, high, high society
High, high, high society,
High, high, high society.

Night after night,

night after night,
checkin' out with the jetset,
you better check it out,
can I count on you ?

High society, high society girl
livin' in a high society,
high society world.
High society, high society girl
livin' in a high society,
high society world.

High, high, high society,
high, high, high society,
high, high, high society.---Lyrics submitted by Ali.
