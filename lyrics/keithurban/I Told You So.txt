You said you needed your space, oh
I wasn't where you wanted to be
I didn't stand in your way
I only want you to be happy
And so how surprised am I to see you here tonight

Well, oh, can't you see? 
That for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

Sometimes in our lives
We get to where we wonder if
The long road that we're on
Is heading in the same direction
When it comes to you and me
We're right where I know we should be

Oh, can't you see? 
That for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
And the slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Oh, please

Oh, can't you see? 
That for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
You don't gotta say you're sorry baby

Oh, can't you see? 
That for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

And I won't say I told you so, oh oh
But I told you so, yeah
Should have known better
Than to leave me, baby
Should have known better
Than to leave me, darling---Lyrics submitted by stephanie.
