Well, I know theres a reason
And I know theres a rhyme
We were meant to be together
And thats why

We can roll with the punches
We can stroll hand in hand
And when I say its forever
You understand

That youre always in my heart
Youre always on my mind
And when it all becomes too much
Youre never far behind

And theres no one
That comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way

I could have turned a different corner
I could have gone another place
Then Id of never had this feeling
That I feel today, yeah

And youre always in my heart
And youre always on my mind
And when it all becomes too much
Youre never far behind

And theres no one
That comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way
Ooh
And youre always in my heart
And youre always on my mind
And when it all becomes too much
Youre never far behind
And theres no one 
That comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way
Ooh 

Only you can love me this way---Lyrics submitted by Niki.
