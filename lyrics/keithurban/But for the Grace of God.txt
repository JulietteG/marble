I can hear the neighbors
They're arguing again
And there hasn't been peace on our street
Since who knows when
I don't mean to listen in
But the shouting is so loud
I turn up the radio
To drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer

(chorus)
But for the grace of God, girl I
I must have been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord, I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

I can see that old man
He's walking past our door
And I've been told that he's rich
But he seems so poor
'Cause no one comes to call on him
And his phone it never rings
He wonders through his empty home
Surrounded by his things
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do

(Chorus)

I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord, I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
Oh Lord, I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

I'd be lost, but for the grace of God---Lyrics submitted by Tracie.
