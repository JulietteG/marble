All I saw was smoke and fire
I didnt feel a thing
But suddenly I was rising higher
And I felt like I just made
The biggest mistake
When I thought about my unborn child
When I thought about my wife
And the answer rang out clear
From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man
Than to lay down his life for love

And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

Maybe you dont understand
I dont understand it all myself
But theres a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine
Hes got a photograph
And theyre waiting for him back home
Its weighing on my mind
Im not trying to be a hero
I dont wanna die
But right now in this moment, you dont think twice

I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would

You dont think about right
You dont think about wrong
You just do what you gotta do, to defend your own
Id do the same
For you
Yes I would

I would give my life
I would make that sacrifice
Cause if it came down to it
Could I take a bullet
For you
Yes I would

Id do it for you ---
