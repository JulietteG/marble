(Verse1)
Whats the time?
Well it gotta be close to midnight
My body's talkin' to me 
It says its time for danger
It says i wanna commit a crime
Wanna be the cause of a fight
I wanna put on a tight skirt
And flirt with a stranger
I've had a knack fom way back 
At breakin the rules once i'd learned the game
Get up lifes too quick i know some place sick
Where this chick'll dance in the flames 
We don't need any money
I always get in for free
You can get in too
If you get in with me 
(Chorus)
Lets go out tonight
I have to go out tonight 
You wanna play lets run away
We won't be back before it New Years Day
Taking me out tonight
meow ha
mmmmmmmmmhmhm yeah e yeah yeah
(Verse 2)
When i get a wink from the door man
Do you know how lucky you'll be 
That your on the line with the feline
Of avenue B
(Chorus) 
Lets go out tonight
I have to go out tonight
You wanna prowl be my night owl
Well take my hand we're gonna 
Howl out tonight
(Verse 3)
In the evening I've got to roam
Can't sleep in the city of neon and chrome
Feels to damn much like home
When the Spanish babies cry
So lets find a bar so dark we forget who we are
Where all the stars from the never's and maybes die
(Chorus)
lets go out tonight
I have to go out tonight
oh ah ah oh ow
Your sweet wanna hit the street
Wanna wail at the moon like a cat in heat
Just take me out tonight
Please take me out tonight
Don't forsake me out tonight
I'll let you make me out tonight
tonight, tonight, tonight---Lyrics submitted by Chloe.
