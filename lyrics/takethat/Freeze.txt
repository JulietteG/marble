With a little bit of work
And a little bit of conversation
With a head full of hope
And a bit of your self belief
Is it asking too much to
Rely on your imagination
Am I asking too much
To remain in your company
Stop everything

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
Well be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze
Dont even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you wont leave
Freeze

With the flicker of a promise
And in view of our situation
I think you should know
That I never wanted this to change
And youre free to say whatever you want to
But whatever you want, whatever you want
Dont change
Please dont change

We can stay here if you hold still
We can stay here for life if you say you will
Well be caught in a moment of time
If we all freeze
Dont even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you wont leave

The words, the words we never say
Dont make a sound till its too late
Just freeze so we dont have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away
The words, the words we never say
Dont make a sound till its too late
Just freeze so we dont have to start again
Before we make the same mistakes
Before we throw it all away

Just freeze
Dont even breathe
Everyone freeze
Then you wont leave
Everyone freeze---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
