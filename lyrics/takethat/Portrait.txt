Life slow down
Youve gone too fast
And words begin to mean a little less

Bones stay strong
Cause the road ahead is long
And every voice will miss us when were gone

Take a portrait, 25 let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba [x2]
Let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Skin dont stretch
Its way too new
And those who look back are only the fools 

Take a portrait, 25 let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Yeah Im singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba [x2]

Years dont come too soon
And days be long and light
Future you can wait
Cause times still on our side 

Take a portrait, 25 let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba [x2]
Let me hear you singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Yeah youre singing it out
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Oh sing it out
Youre free to come alive
Youre free to come tonight---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
