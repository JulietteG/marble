When the walls are closing in
And youre standing in the dark
Dont know where you can begin
All the pressure on your heart
Heavy load inside your head
No more colour in the sky
Ill be lying in your bed
Happy being here until I die

I see light just around the corner
Make sense of it all when were together
I see you surrender put your hands up
Youll be safe with me

Im going to give you my love
Know that my affection
Im going to give you my love
Comes with my protection
I wanna give you my love
You are my addiction
I wanna give you my love
I cant give you up
Im gonna give you my love
Know that I will listen
Im gonna give you my love
My love no condition
I wanna give you my love
All of my decision
I wanna give you my love
I cant give you up

Were gonna make it to the end
Even longer if we try
We gonna find a place to land
Therell be danger but we will survive

I see light just around the corner
Make sense of it all when were together
I see you surrender put your hands up
Youll be safe with me

Im going to give you my love
Know that my affection
Im going to give you my love
Comes with my protection
I wanna give you my love
You are my addiction
I wanna give you my love
I cant give you up
Im gonna give you my love
Know that I will listen
Im gonna give you my love
My love no condition
I wanna give you my love
All of my decision
I wanna give you my love
I cant give you up

Dont ever think about that
I will never hold you back
Spread your wings butterfly
Cause Ill be here till the day I die
Till the day that I die

Im going to give you my love
Know that my affection
Im going to give you my love
Comes with my protection
I wanna give you my love
You are my addiction
I wanna give you my love
I cant give you up
Im gonna give you my love
Know that I will listen
Im gonna give you my love
My love no condition
I wanna give you my love
All of my decision
I wanna give you my love
I cant give you up---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
