Today this could be, the greatest day of our lives
Before it all ends, before we run out of time
Stay close to me,
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me.

Tonight this could be the greatest night of our lives
Lets make a new start,
The future is ours to find
Can you see it, can you see it in my eyes
Can you feel it now, can you hold it in your arms tonight
Hold on
Hold on,
Hold on
Hold on (Tonight)
Hold on
Hold on

Oh stay close to me (Hold On)
Stay close to me
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay closes me

Ooooooh
Hold your head high, (Hold On)
Arms open wide
Yea the world starts to come alive when you stay close it me

Today this could be the greatest day of our lives
Today this could be the greatest day of our lives

Oooooh
And the world comes alive
And the world comes alive
And the would comes alive
Oh oh oooooh
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive) hold on
Stay close to me (and the world comes alive)
Watch the world come alive tonight
Stay close to me (Hold on)
Oh stay close to me and the world comes alive
Stay close to me and the world comes alive

Watch the world come alive tonight
(stay close to me) oh oh ohoooo---Lyrics submitted by Abi Hood.
