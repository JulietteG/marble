[Daniel]

Seven days has gone so fast
I really thought the pain would pass
Its been only an hour since I thought of you
cause youre not answering the phone
Id settle for a busy tone
at least by that I know,
that youre okay
A girl like you aint meant to go away... ohh

[Chorus]
And now youre gone,
aint nothing else I want
And now that its over,
theres nothing else I want
What have I done,
looks I was wrong
is everything really meant to change?
I guess were like water and a flame
water and a flame

[Adele]
Im tired of this empty house
I need a drink to get me out
a couple more till I forget your name
I saw a boy that looked like you
I didnt quite know what to do
I took a power of will to break my stare
I realized what I wanted wasnt there

[Chorus]
And now youre gone,
aint nothing else I want
And now that its over,
theres nothing else I want
What have I done,
looks like I was wrong
is everything really meant to change?
I guess were like water and a flame
water and a flame

[Middle]

Daniel: If you see me coming
Adele: I look away, I look away
Daniel: And if youre minds made up
Adele: I look away, I will look away
Daniel: If you worry about..
Adele: Im ok, Im ok, yes I am
Daniel: All this sorrow and this pain is gonna go away!

[Chorus]
And now youre gone,
aint nothing else I want
And now that its over,
theres nothing else I want
What have I done,
looks I was wrong
is everything really meant to change?
I guess were like water and a flame
water and a flame---Lyrics submitted by laura.
