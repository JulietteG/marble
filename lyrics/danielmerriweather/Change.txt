i saw a dried up river and rich man turning on a garden hose,
i see a young man picking up a gun i guess thats where the money goes,
am i just as good as a bad man sleeping while the rest are dying
or am i just as bad as a good man saying theres no use in trying

Oooo tell me do you still believe
Oooo everything that you read
til we learn to get together and see who we really are
aint nothing gonna change
aint nothing gonna change 
if nobodys gonna wake up and start asking whose in charge
aint nothing gonna change
aint nothing gonna change
aint nothing gonna change
nanananana (yeah)

(rap)
n aint sh*t changing but diapers on babies get higher than the background singers singing (naanaanaanaa) singing (nananana)
ok sing it

some people do it all for money & some do it all for their love
some do it all for the glory theres nothing else their thinking of
i saw a man in a four door truck complaining that the price was high
like a well fed man with a spoon in his hand saying who ate all the apple pie (yeah)

Oooo tell me do you still believe
Oooo everything that you read
til we learn to get together and see who we really are
aint nothing gonna change
aint nothing gonna change 
if nobodys gonna wake up and start asking whose in charge
aint nothing gonna change
aint nothing gonna change
aint nothing gonna change
nanananana (yeah)

(rap)
If I aint ready to listen im never gonna listen 
most follow intuition while they wishing it would work
and my vision isnt perfect so i dont nver learn for it
go on and wish for some change like a church worker
hallelujah preacher i am not influenced 
if i dont donate to your movement am i not improving
and while a poor kill a poor for a portion 
that piece of American society pie 
i get high the munchies i got 
so bare witness 
i got this girl looking at you cuz my rims kissing (mwah) 
n i aint ready to wait 
when its dollars on the brain why would you expect change

til we learn to get together and see who we really are
aint nothing gonna change
aint nothing gonna change 
if nobodys gonna wake up and start asking whose in charge
aint nothing gonna change
aint nothing gonna change
aint nothing gonna change no no
(rap)
n aint sh*t changing but diapers on babies get higher than the background singers singing (naanaanaanaa) singing (nananana)---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
