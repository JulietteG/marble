What's going on all over this whole wide world?
What's going on all over this whole wide world?

Calling there's an emergency and I'm only dialling cause it's necessary
Calling there's an emergency and I'm only dialling cause it's necessary

What is going on in addy planet Earth? Dat ah where we live it addy place of our birth
Madness and mayhem man the world is corrupt, like a volcano it soon will erupt

Look at the people in the streets, everywhere they don't seem like they care
And everyone is getting mad, it just seems like we've all lost the plot

Calling there's an emergency and I'm only dialling cause it's necessary
999 there's an emergency and I'm only calling cause it's necessary

These cities are on fire and the pandemonium's getting higher
All these cities are on fire and the pandemonium's getting higher
State of emergency, I'm gunner tell everyone

Check it out blood it ain't meant to be
The way they carry on man it's so crazy
When I think trouble is coming for me
I lay down in my bed and call the almighty
Now everybody can see hate is ugly and it's everywhere
You say you wanner be free
Yet everyday for the war you prepare
Calling there's an emergency and I'm only calling cause it's necessary
911 there's an emergency and I'm only calling cause it's necessary

These cities are on fire and the pandemonium's getting higher
All these cities are on fire and the pandemonium's getting higher

New York London Paris and Pill
Kingston Compton Birmingham Cape Hill
Moscow Bradford Brixton Amsterdam
Hamburg Detroit Kabul Ely Milan
Basra Havana Rio Wolverhampton
San Paulo Sydney Osaka Lisbon
Czechnya Logos LA and Sudan
Jerusalem Gaza Strip Washington

State of emergency, I'm gunner tell everyone
There's a state of emergency I'm gunner tell everyone
These cities are on fire and the pandemonium's getting higher
All these places are on fire and the pandemonium's getting higher---Lyrics submitted by Chlo Watson.
