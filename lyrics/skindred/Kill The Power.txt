This is a Resident Evil Attack,
Zombie take over boy watch your back,
Infected, disease unprotected.
Sound clash a lick so everybody dress bat.
Good vs evil, evil vs worse,

Don't fuck wit we. Sound boy, no body fuck wit we.

No retreat and no surrendah.

Boy stop talk. You mustn't hate fuck.
Everything you ever said you know it is a lie,

Rude boy fool boy, move from me door,
