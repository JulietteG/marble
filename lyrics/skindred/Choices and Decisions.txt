At first you don't succeed
Tried and tried again 
Worked your hands to bleed 
Dont give up my friend

Well in this game called life you got to keep on trying 
Dont make no body push you down and give you pure problem 
OI! Life it is for living not for aggravation 
When their getting under your skin and trying to cause you tension 
You tell them, inside this flesh nuff ah we jusa suffer 
And influences they will come take we over 
1 think in life I and I must remember 
Stand up for something and youll hear the oppressor singing 

You got to make up your mind 
Life, Choices and Decisions 
You got to make up your mind 
Life, Choices and Decisions 
Where do we go there are so many signs 
Life, Choices and Decisions 
You got to make up your mind 
Life, Choices and Decisions 

Well well at first you dont smoke weed but now youre hooked on smack 
You look back over your life and you wish you could go back 
Rewind, reject it and start it again 
You know you wouldnt end up with this juxtaposition 
Right! Inside this flesh nuff ah we jusa suffer 
And influences they will come take we over 
1 think in life I and I must remember 
Stand up for something and youll hear the oppressor singing 

To follow or to lead 
Or do you just pretend? 
To pause or to proceed 
The choice is yours my friend 

Which way do you go? Where you gunner go? I do not know! You see, 
Life is one big road with lots of signs, surely youll find 
You got to make up your mind to face reality all the time 
Many ah problem many ah joy 
Never you try to take life for a toy 
Some doing good lord some doing bad 
All of these choices are driving me 
Mad, So mad, driving me mad, driving me mad, driving me mad, driving me mad 

Life, Choices and Decisions, Life, Choices and Decisions 
Life, Choices and Decisions
