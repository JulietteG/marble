Frustration hits you as you wake up in the morning,
A brand new day brings a brand new mourning.
Reasons to be tearful part 1 2 and 3,
Standing on the edge of insanity.

Oh, I'm looking for dollars yet finding dimes. (x2)
Time after time.

The battle rages everyday that you're breathing,
What you're giving out, you're not always receiving.
The more you pay the more it won't go away,
Stacked up to the sky, I hear when they say:

Oh, I'm looking for dollars yet finding dimes. (x2)

This city's hard,
This city's cold,
It breaks your heart,
And it is hard to keep the wolves from your door.

To keep the wolves from your door. (x3)

So disappointing, it breaks your heart. (x4)

(Ohh)
It's all over, all over now.
All over, it's all over now. (x2)
All over, it's all over.
It's all over, all over now.
All over, it's all over...

This city's hard,
This city's cold,
It breaks your heart,
And it is hard to keep the wolves from your door.

(Ohh)
To keep the wolves from your door. (x3)

To keep the wolves them from your door.

To keep the wolves from your door. (x3)

To keep the wolves them from your door.

To keep the wolves from your door. (x2)
