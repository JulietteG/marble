Hey gimme gimme chemicals, 
Gimme the fix, 
Gimme back control. 
A white hot white revival; 
We're gonna be saved tonight 

A twist and hit with some friends of mine, 
We hang like sneakers from the power line. 
Now that I'm 26 in no state of mind to feel relieved 
Or to be satisfied singing "all this pressure, 
All this pain and all these sins swim through my veins". 
If I could do it again, 
I'd probably do it the same 
But I'd try to cut back on the cigarettes

Hey gimme gimme chemicals, 
Gimme the fix, 
Gimme back control. 
A white-hot white revival; 
We're gonna be saved tonight

She blew my nose 
Then she curled my toes 
Then she made me breakfast, 
Lied out my clothes, 
Went back to sleep and never called her back, 
The only plans I make are to block and back.

But I can't get it out of my head, 
There's a rhythm to the words 
That she said and it keeps me screaming

You know the pharmacy sparked the revival 
And now they're giving it all away

Hey gimme gimme chemicals, 
Gimme the fix, 
Gimme back control. 
A white hot white revival; 
We're gonna be saved tonight---Lyrics submitted by Chloe.
