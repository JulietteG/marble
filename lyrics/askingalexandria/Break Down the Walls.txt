Close your eyes 
And leave all your fears behind 
Close your eyes 
And follow me until the end

So if you're hopeless
We can pick up the pieces
If you're broken 
I can carry the pain
Are you with me
Watch in the flames as higher

Sing this with me!

Break down the walls
I want it all
I wont stop until i burn this to the ground
We scream and shout
'Til the lights go out
I wont stop until i burn this to the ground

We wont take this
You can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
Break down the walls
I want it all
I wont stop until i burn this to the ground
yeah yeah

Don't let go
We carry our touches high (Always burning)
We've come to far
To throw it all away

So are you with me 
Watch in the flames as higher

Sing this with me!

Break down the walls
I want it all
I wont stop until i burn this to the ground
We scream and shout
'Til the lights go out
I wont stop until i burn this to the ground

We wont take this
You can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
Break down the walls
I want it all
I wont stop until i burn this to the ground---Lyrics submitted by Will Hughes.
