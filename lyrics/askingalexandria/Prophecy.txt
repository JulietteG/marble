How stubborn are the scars when they won't fade away?
Or just a gentle reminder that now are better days?
We'll be home soon so dry your eyes
You'll be okay
(You'll be okay)

Oh my god
The water is rising, it's rising!
You just have to believe in me
Failing that I'll ride this storm alone

We can still make it out
Fuck!

I can help you through this
But you have to take my hand
I can take you home
Take my hand
Take my hand!

I should've known the tides were getting higher
We can still survive
They think we're drowning but our heads are still
above the waves
above the waves

(I should've known the tides were getting higher,
We can still survive, Above the waves)

(I should've know the tides were getting higher) x2

We can still survive

You never said goodbye(goodbye)
You never said goodbye(goodbye)
You never said goodbye(goodbye)
You never said goodbye

 And now you're on your own!

You never said goodbye
You never said goodbye
Goodbye!---Lyrics submitted by Sabrina.
