I can't see through the tears in my eyes [x2]
I can't breathe

I feel I failed
I was meant to make you smile
I was meant to make you shine
To make you shine

They said this could never happen
They said we could never be
Are you telling me you listened

I was meant to make you smile [x3]
I was meant to make you shine [x3]

So there's no you and me
And we can't live this way forever
You said you'd run away with me
You'd run away

That we'd escape from the ordinary
That we'd escape from the world that tied us down
That we'd escape from the ordinary
That we'd escape from the world that tied us down

So now this is over and the world falls upon me
I never expected to be here alone
The shadows are forming as we burst into flames
Why does this end this way---Lyrics submitted by Clint.
