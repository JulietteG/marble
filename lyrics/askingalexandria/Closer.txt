You let me violate you,
You let me desecrate you,
You let me penetrate you,
You let me complicate you.

Help me, I broke apart my insides,
Help me, I got no soul to sell.
Help me, the only thing that works for me,
Help me get away from myself.

I wanna fuck you like an animal,
I wanna feel you from the inside.
I wanna fuck you like an animal,
My whole existence is flawed.
You get my closer to god!

You can have my isolation,
You can have the hate that it brings.
You can have my absence of faith,
You can have my everything.

Help me! Tear down my reason!
Help me! It's your sex I can smell.
Help me! You make me perfect!
Help me become someone else.

I wanna fuck you like an animal,
I wanna feel you from the inside.
I wanna fuck you like an animal,
My whole existence is flawed.
You get my closer to god!

I wanna feel you from the inside.
I wanna fuck you like an animal,
My whole existence is flawed.
You get my closer to god!

I wanna fuck you like an animal,
I wanna fuck you like an animal,
You get my closer to god!
Help me become someone else.

Though every forest, above the trees,
Within my stomach, scraped off my knees,
I drink the honey inside your hive,
You are the reason I stay alive!

Though every forest, above the trees,
Within my stomach, scraped off my knees,
I drink the honey inside your hive,
You are the reason I stay alive!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
