You said you cried a thousand times
But I don't believe a word of it
You loved it when my heart stopped
So you start to listen

Just sit and listen
Don't test my words

Just believe
I did believe
Who am I to say

Fall Amy fly
You can't lie your way out of this one

Put faith aside
We have no way of knowing how short our tie is
Before the Devil knows your dead
There will be blood
There will be blood
Now you know just how I feel

Fall Amy fly
You can't lie your way out of this one

Oh baby just maybe you're not the one

They Fall!
As they stand at the end of it all
And after it all,
the looks of it
say it's in itself across the lake

Oh baby just maybe you're not the one
You never were
It was all sympathy and simple words of nothingness

This is where you die
This is where you...---Lyrics submitted by Janelle.
