False tales lies of a washed up prom queen
Why'd you tell me everything was fine? 
Everything was okay?

Get on your knees! OH!

Oh, Tear me up!
No, Everything's gone inside!
Oh! You should've told me, at least I would've known!
Oh! You should've told me and carved it in my bones!

Tear out my eyes!
Remove the gift of-
Sight proves ever cursing!
The light can't find us here!
Painted red my eyes are burning!
And still you hide behind the waves!
Your silence is haunting!
Your words relentless,
burying in!
My heart betrays me for a last first kiss good-
Bye!

Fall asleep!
Jar one eye!
Jar one eye!

Spilling every lie you've spilled before,
Stil I'm not forgiving you!
What happened between us, what can I give to save us?
Being righteous isn't quite enough!
What happened between us, what can I give to save me?

These oceans are far between our hearts!
Our breathing has got too hard!
These oceans are far between our hearts!
Our breathing has got too hard!

Go!
Scream with the voice of an angel!
Lie in the eyes of the gospel!
Smile in the face of your victims!
Smile for me!
This is my last request to you!
Hold my breath!
I was clutching on to disaster!
Hold my breath!
I was clutching on to disaster
Hold my breath---Lyrics submitted by Benji.
