Am I insane?
I ask myself over and over and over again
Am I alone?
Surrounded by shadows
I think It might just be the end

[Chorus]
I won't let you be the death of me
No I refuse to let you bring me down
Bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
And I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back
And I'm better than ever.

The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there.
The voices who got better but they wont go away

Am I insane?
[x3]

The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there.

[Chorus]

The tears
Have left a blur
That I can't explain
The pain
Has left a hole
In which my heart should've been

I'm blind with rage
And I can't shake this feeling
Irrational
Impetuous
intemperate
[x2]
