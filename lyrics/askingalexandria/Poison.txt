Incompetent son of a bitch,
Keep your tongue tight.
Cut your losses.
You're on thin ice, so tread light.
I don't wanna listen to your "he said, she said" shit.
Keep your mouth shut and listen motherfucker.
I can't stand this,
It was never meant to be so hard.
Satisfaction was supposed to come and ease my heart.

I don't feel this anymore I need to get away.
All the love in my heart can't even find a way.

These words they fall off my tongue like a poison.
I hope they kill you all,
I hope I never see your faces again.
I see your faces again.
Yeah
I wanna watch the whole world,
I wanna watch the whole world burn down, burn down.
I wanna watch the world burn,
I wanna watch the whole world burn down, burn down.

I won't pretend I'm not disgusted with everything you are.
I won't deny that I'm revolted by everything you say you stand for.
Where do I go?
What do I say?
Where do I draw the line?
Can I move on?
Can I let go before I lose my mind?
Am I alone after everything we've suffered through?
Feels though what once was us has dwindled down to me and you.

I wanna watch the whole world,
I wanna watch the whole world burn down, burn down.
I wanna watch the whole world,
I wanna watch the whole world burn down, burn down.

These words they fall off my tongue like a poison.
I hope they kill you all,
I hope I never see your faces again.
I see your faces again.
Yeah
I wanna watch the whole world,
I wanna watch the whole world burn down, burn down.
I wanna watch the world burn,
I wanna watch the whole world burn down, burn down.---Lyrics submitted by Benjamin Patter.
