Yeah

Go

You're fucking crazy, if you think that I'll ever change
I am mine, I am me, I'll never change my ways
I must've a route to escape
Conduct a predetermined damnation for eternity
Damnation for eternity

I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare, pray for me, no
There's things I bury inside, to keep away from the light
Don't you dare, pray for me

I been so fucked up for so long
And I can't keep my head up on my own
Holy fuck, why do I bother
Never gonna keep, anything
I wanted to fall down the crack
I don't give a fuck if I die today
Holy shit, I've lost my mind
Reality, is starting to unwind

Don't pray for me

I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare, pray for me, no
There's things I bury inside, to keep away from the light
Don't you dare, pray for me

I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare, pray for me, no
There's things I bury inside, to keep away from the light
Don't you dare, pray for me---Lyrics submitted by Salomone.
