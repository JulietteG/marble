Im alive
I'm alive

Watch yourself, Im taking over
The cracks in the pavement wont break my stride
I tred lightly
I tred lightly

Im alive
I cant believe what Ive become
I wont stop breathing
Your world is falling at your feet
I wont stop breathing
I'm alive
Yeah!
Oh my god
I cant believe what Ive become
I wont stop breathing
Your world is falling at your feet
I wont stop breathing

Just cause youre breathing
Dont mean youre alive
Excuses are useless 
When your mouths stapled shut

I can't believe, what I've become
I can't believe
I can't believe, What I've become
I can't believe

Oh!

Youre drowning in the backroom
So this is what it feels to waltz?
You're drowning in the backroom
So this is what it feels to waltz?
You're drowning in the backroom
So this is what it feels to waltz?
You're drowning in the backroom
So this is what it feels to waltz?
What it feels to waltz!

I must be dreaming
Demise so surreal
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming---Lyrics submitted by Dalton.
