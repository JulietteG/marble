You loved me for all the wrong reasons.
All the wrong reasons.
There's nothing but pain left here I know.
What's killing me, 
Is that I'm killing you! 

Three years of torment and torturous love, 
Stained with tears and mistrust, 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! 
I can't hold you any longer in this hell I'm in, 
Cause your heart is too weak for me to break again! 
All the mistakes that I've made, 
You forgave. What the fuck! You shouldn't have stayed.
You'd always say, "There's so much love in you!"
I can't believe that you can't see that... 

You loved me for all the wrong reasons.
I'm not the same as I used to be.
There's nothing but pain left here, I know.
What's killing me, 
Is that I'm killing you! 

Do you remember the beginning?
Heartbeats one and the same... 
Living smitten in Texas, burning bright as a flame! 
So young and in love, no care what anyone said, 
'Til my soul grew cold and my heart turned dead! 

What went so wrong with me! 
Why did I break this! 
Why was I so blind, too fucking dumb to see, 
That we were perfect, 'til I turned around
And gave in to debauchery! 
This is your chance to escape this, 
My goodbye with a last kiss.
Cause I know deep down, you know that... 

You loved me for all the wrong reasons.
I'm not the same as I used to be.
There's nothing but pain left here, I know.
What's killing me, 
Is that I'm killing you! 

You loved me for all the wrong reasons.
I'm not the same as I used to be.
There's nothing but pain left here, I know.
What's killing me, 
Is that I'm killing you! 

What's killing me
It's killing me (x2)
Is that I'm killing you.
What's killing me
It's killing me (x2)
Is that I'm killing you.---Lyrics submitted by Maria Velazquez.
