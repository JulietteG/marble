This isnt over baby dont believe a word they said
But then
She takes a moment to ponder
To wonder what couldve been given another chance
To find the light in the darkness and way out of this
If only she could see what I could see

She takes a moment to stumble to her feet
If only I was there to hold her hand
If only she saw what I saw shed get out of this one
Shed get out of here

What burns the most is that you lied right to my face
And still I hold your hand to set you free
What Burns the most is that you lied right to my face
And still I hold your hand to set you free (To set you)

With eyes closed
Her heart breaks
And through it all
She brought this on herself, on herself
With eyes closed 
Her heart breaks
And through it all
She brought this on herself, on herself

For me, for you, the fallen, save her
For us, for me, for good, save her
For me, for you, the fallen, save her
for us, for me, for good, save her

She falls, she falls before me 
She falls, she falls before me
She falls, she falls before me 
She falls, she falls before me

This songs, for

With eyes closed
Her heart breaks
And after it all
She brought this on herself
With eyes closed
Her heart breaks
And after it all
She brought this on herself---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
