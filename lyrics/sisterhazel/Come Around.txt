The sky fell down and pulled us in
Stole away my oxygen
Left me standing breathless there with you
The ocean wrapped around the sun
The smell of June, the taste of your tongue
Is all I'd ever need

And I, well I wanna be clear
Well I needed you here
And I'm waiting you out
But you, you don't have a clue
And I'd drive right through
Oh to find you anywhere, yeah

The sky fell down, pulled us in
Stole away my oxygen
Left me standing breathless there with you
The ocean wrapped around the sun
The smell of June, the taste of your tongue
Is all I'd ever need

But you, you keep on waiting
For the sun to come around
And you, you keep on waiting
For something better
Better off to come around

And you, well you wanted more time
So I gave you more time
Oh but I am the sun 
That waits to come around

Tha sky fell down, pulled us in
Stole away my oxygen
Left me standing breathless there with you
The ocean wrapped around the sun
The smell of June, the taste of your tongue
Is all I'd ever need

But you, you keep on waiting
For the sun to come around
And you, you keep on waiting
For something better
Better off to come around

Whoa but you were a restless soul
Where's the next best thing
Well I'll wait for you
All my life wait
For you to come around
Come around, yeah

The sky fell down, pulled us in
Stole away my oxygen
Left me standing breathless there with you
The ocean wrapped around the sun
The smell of June, the taste of your tongue
Is all I'd ever need

But you, you keep on waiting
For the sun to come around
And you, you keep on waiting
For something better
Better off to come around
Come around
Keep on waiting
Come around
You're better off to
Come around
Come around
Come around---Lyrics submitted by Mabel.
