Whoah, I miss you.
I miss being overwhelmed by you
and I need rescue.
I think Im fading away.
And I keep thinking 
That youll wake me with a whisper in my ear.
And I keep hoping
That youll sneak in my room.

So I wait and I wait
and I run old scenes through my tired head
Of the days that we laid by the school and said forever.
Was that the best Ill ever be?

Whoah, I miss you.
I miss talking all night long with you, yeah
and I need this too, to find a way to your home.
Whoa, Well, my love, can you hear me?
Have I been hoping loud enough, wishing hard enough?
Can you see me
When Im asleep all alone, alone?

So I wait and I wait
and I run myself in the same old circles.
I sit and I stare, and I run old scenes through my weary head
Of the days that we laid by the school and said forever.
Was that the best Ill ever be?

Cant keep my hands from shaking
Stumbling through the wreckage again.
But youre gone.

So I wait and I wait
and I run myself in the same old circles.
I sit and I stare, and I run old scenes through my tired head
Of the days that we laid on our backs and said forever
Was that the best Ill ever be?
Was that the best Ill ever be?
Whoah, was that the best Ill ever be?---Lyrics submitted by Lucinda.
