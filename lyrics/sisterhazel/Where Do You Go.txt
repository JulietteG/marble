Rope a ring around it
I can't think about it
I can barely start to even wrap my head around it
Water's rising 'round us
Sinking ships surround us
I can't believe she even found a way inside to drown us

I'm not so sure anymore what's next
Or if there's anything left for us
What will we find inside of the wreck
Yeah, we both know
It's all just washed away

Where do you go, an What do you do
When all you have left is hangin' on you
Where do you go and what do you do
When you lose everything
You ever knew

Shine a light into it
Shoot a cannon through it
Spill it all and hope you find a way to make it through it
Cause down is up, and up is down
And love lies dieing on the ground
You find a line that's in the sand and
Figure out who drew it

I'm not quiet sure anymore what's next
Or if there's anything left for us
What will we find inside of the wreck
Yeah, we both know
It's all just washed away

Where do you go, What do you do
When all you have left is hangin' on you
Where do you go, and what do you do
When you lose everything

Rope a ring around it
And I can't think about it
I can barely start to wrap my head around it
Cause down is up, and up is down
And love lies dieing on the ground
You find a line that's in the sand and
Figure out who drew it

Where do you go, an What do you do
When all you have left is hangin' on you
Where do you go, and what do you do
When you lose everything
You ever knew

Where do you go, an What do you do
When all you have been taken from you
Where do you go, what do you do
When you lose everything---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Wheeler.
