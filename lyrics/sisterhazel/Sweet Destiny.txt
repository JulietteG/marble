I will listen
And I will talk to you yeah
And I will run away with you
If you ask me to yeah

And I will sing
If you will dance for me and
And I will paint the Mona Lisa
But she'd look like you yeah

Seems like everywhere I turn
I burn in my own skin and
Won't you comfort me old friend, yeah

[Chorus]
Sweet destiny you tapped me with your finger
And you looked into my eyes for the believer
When I've lost my way and
Sweet destiny how long have you been looking for me
Cause I've been searching all the wrong
Bars and churches
Endless searches
To harbor me

And I will quit
All the things that do not fit
And we will watch the sunrise
A new beginning
Believe, Believe
Cause there's times when its so hard
To do just that
There's much too much to comprehend 
Where I belong at all and

It seems like everywhere I turn
I burn in my own skin and
Won't you comfort me old friend

[Chorus]
Sweet destiny you tapped me with your finger
And you looked into my eyes for the believer
When I cast my doubts and
Sweet destiny how long have you been looking for me
Cause I've been hiding in all the wrong
Bars and churches
Endless searches
To cover me

[Chorus]
Sweet destiny you tap my shoulder with your finger
And you looked into my eyes for the believer
When I've lost my way and
Sweet destiny how long have you been looking for me
Cause I've been searching all the wrong
Bars and churches
Endless searches

And I will shine
And you'll remind me to be gracious
And I will be the perfect stranger
That you tell your secrets to
And I will listen
And will talk to you and
I will run away with you
If you ask me to---Lyrics submitted by Troy.
