I could leave you right now
Pick up the phone and say we're through
Even though we both know
I'd come right back to you

It's a fact I need you
You're the oxygen I breathe
You're running through my veins under my skin
You're no good for me

I know I gotta give you up
But I just can't let you go
Save my love for another
Cause it's wasted on you

And even though you drown me
I keep holding onto you
I can't let you go
My love's wasted on you

And even though I'm no fool
I know I'm just passing through
But now I know
My love's wasted on you

If only I could hate you
I mean I try but I just can't
But maybe I could find you
In the arms of another man

Even though we both know
It's the beginning to our end
I'm running out of excuses
Lying to myself, thinking you could change

I know I gotta give you up
But I just can't let you go
Save my love for another
Cause it's wasted on you

And even though you drown me
I keep holding onto you
I can't let you go
My love's wasted on you

And even though I'm no fool
I know I'm just passing through
But now I know
My love's wasted on you

I'm not thinking of you
I'm not broken in two
I'm not looking back
My love's wasted on you

I'm not thinking of you
I'm not broken in two
I'm not looking back
My love's wasted on you

I'm not thinking of you
I'm not broken in two (I'm not broken)
I'm not looking back
My love's wasted on you (it's all wasted, it's all wasted, it's all wasted)
Ah o Oh o
It's all wasted on you
You........---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.
