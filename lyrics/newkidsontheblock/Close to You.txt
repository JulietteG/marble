La La La La La La
La La La La La La
hey

I know it's hard (I know it's hard)
to see me go (to see me go)
To see me standing so close to the door
I know it's hard when I'm far away
But I promise you when I come back
I'll stay

Close to your hands
Close to your legs
Close to the way your body fits on the bed
Close to your hips
Close to your lips
Close to the only on that I can't resist
Close to your laugh
Close to your words
Giving you everything I know you deserve
Clsoe to you baby
Close to your world
Close to you

Baby, turn off that frown
Wipe off your face
You know I'm weak to it
And, you're making me late
Turn off that frown
And come over here
I'm gonna say it just like I did before
Gonna make it crystal clear
When I'm...

Close to your hands
Close to your legs
Close to the way your body fits on the bed
Close to your hips
Close to your lips
Close to the only on that I can't resist
Close to your laugh
Close to your words
Giving you everything I know you deserve
Clsoe to you baby
Close to your world
Close to you

I'll be counting down the days
With a picture of your face in my heart
Before you know it, I'll be there
Touching you in ways
So close than all the wasted time apart
So close to you girl

Close to your hands
Close to your legs
Close to the way your body fits on the bed
Close to your hips
Close to your lips
Close to the only on that I can't resist
Close to your laugh
Close to your words
Giving you everything I know you deserve
Clsoe to you baby
Close to your world
Close to you

I'll always be close to you---Lyrics submitted by Polly.
