(Its our night)

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Wait! Change nothing
This moment feels so perfect
Lets just make it something
I Know that you deserve it

Like a candle this burning in the wind
Were burning fast
Let the world keep on turning
This chance might be the last

Dont let it go
Its the moment weve be waiting for
Till tomorrow were invincible
And I promise not to leave your side
Cause we own, we own tonight

Doesnt matter what we did before
Nothings ever been this beautiful
Right here right now belongs to you and I
We own tonight
We own tonight, we own tonight

Stop! For a minute
Can you feel the magic?
Cause tonight theres no limit
If you want it, you can have it

Like a candle this burning in the wind
Were burning fast
Let the world keep on turning
This chance could be the last

Dont let it go
Its the moment weve be waiting for
Till tomorrow were invincible
And I promise not to leave your side
Cause we own, we own tonight

Doesnt matter what we did before
Nothings ever been this beautiful
Right here right now belongs to you and I
We own tonight

I dont want this feeling to end
Dont let the sunrise begin
To keep you here in my arms
Id do anything

Let the world keep on turning
This chance might be the last

Dont let it go
Its the moment weve be waiting for
Till tomorrow were invincible
And I promise not to leave your side
Cause we own, we own tonight

Doesnt matter what we did before
Nothings ever been this beautiful
Right here right now belongs to you and I
We own tonight

We own tonight, we own tonight
(Dont let it go)

We own tonight

We own tonight, we own tonight ---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.
