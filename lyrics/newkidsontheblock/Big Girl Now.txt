'm a big boy, you're a big girl now, now, ow 
I'm a big girl, you're a big boy now, now, ow 

Back in the day when you were young (it was fun) 
Little girl, didn't think you were the one (Now here i come) 
Your sexy walk, your sexy talk (Thats whats up)

You know I like the way you moving (Moving) 
Girl you're all grown up and now your ready to let it go 
Wanna be a big girl, got to prove it (Prove it) 
With a body like that you got a grown man ready to blow

Gonna give you something you ain't ever gonna forget

Wanna work it like a big girl let's explore 
Drop it to the floor, booty get raw 

You know I like the way you moving (Moving)

Wanna be a big girl, got to prove it (Prove it) 
With a body like that you got a grown man ready to blow
