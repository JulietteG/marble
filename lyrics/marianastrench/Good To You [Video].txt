(Josh Ramsay)
Everyone's around. No words are coming now, 
And I can't find my breath can we just say the rest with no sound?
And I know this isn't enough, I still don't measure up. 
And I'm not prepared, sorry is never there when you need it.

And I-I do want you to know I hold you up above everyone.
And I do want you to know I think you'd be good to me and 
I'd be so good to you.
I would.

(Jessica Lee)
I thought I saw a sign, somewhere between the lines.
And maybe it's me, maybe I only see what I want.
And I still have your letter, just got caught between someone I just invented, who I really am, and who I've become.

(Both)
And I-I do I want you to know I'll hold you up above everyone.
And I do I want you to know I think you'd be good to me and 
I'd be so good to you.

Whoa-oh-oh. Whoa-oh-oh. Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Whoa-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh. Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

And I-I do want you to know I'll hold you up above everyone.
And I do want you to know I think you'd be good to me and 
I'd be so good to you. 
I would.
I do want you to know I hold you up above everyone.
And I do want you to know I think you'd be good to me and 
I'd be so good to you. 
(I'd be good to you, I'd be good to you)
Yeah I would.
(I'd be good to you, I'd be good to you, Yeah I'd be so good to you)
Yeah I would.
(I'd be good to you. Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
So good to you.---Lyrics submitted by Becca.
