Gonna make a heart throb out of me
Just a bit of minor surgery 
These desperate times call for desperate measures 
I'll give you something to cry about 
Show some skin, and would be cache 
How could you let this get to desperate measures now? 

For a first effort this, 
Feels kinda last ditch 
I guess this just 
Got kinda drastic 
Trust us you just fell off the bus, baby 

I can't let this, I can't let this go 

When I got you right where I want you 
I been pushing for this for so long 
Kiss me, just once, for luck 
These are desperate measures now 

I can't let this, I can't let this go 

Have a piece of American dream 
Open up, and swallow, on your knees 
And say "Thank you" 
I'd like some desperate measures, please 

For a first effort this, 
Feels kinda last ditch 
I guess this just 
Got kinda drastic 
Trust us, you just fell off the bus, suckers 
Yeah, well, payback is a mother fucker 

I can't let this, I can't let this go 

When I got you right where I want you 
I been pushing for this for so long 
Kiss me, just once, for luck 
These are desperate measures now 

I can't let this, I can't let this go 

Go Forever, for worse, or better 
My poor heart will only surrender 
Go forever, for worse, or better 
My poor heart will only surrender, now 

I can't let this, I can't let this go 

When I got you right where I want you 
I been pushing for this for so long 
Kiss me, just once, for luck 
These are desperate measures now 

I can't let this, I can't let this go 

When I got you right where I want you 
I been pushing for this for so long 
Kiss me, just once, for luck 
These are desperate measures now 

I can't let this, I can't let this go---Lyrics submitted by Sky Barnes.
