I know I never make this easy
 It's easy--er to disappear
 You say give me something that I can go on
 Together, yeah, anywhere but here

Sing it back
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
 Hey yeah
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh... 

And I'm begging you
 Bring me back to life
 I just can't stand leaving you alone at night
 It's too late to go
 It has taken me forever just to try to know
 One for the money
 Two for the show
 Three to get ready
 And four to go
 For the life of me
 Don't know why it took me so long to see

Just stutter, stutter, stutter
 D-... Did I stutter stutter stutter
 D-... Did I stutter stutter stutter
 D-... Did I stutter stutter
 D-... Did I?

Sunshine
 Blinds you if you stare but
 Now I see it crystal
 Crystal clear
 So here I am
 You can take or leave me
 But I won't ever be anywhere but here

Sing it back
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
 Sing it back to me, yeah
 Oh oh, oh oh, oh...

 And I'm begging you
 Bring me back to life
 I just can't stand leaving you alone at night
 It's too late to go
 It has taken me forever just to try to know
 One for the money
 Two for the show
 Three to get ready
 And four to go
 For the life of me
 Don't know why it took me so long to see

Just stutter, stutter, stutter
 D-... Did I stutter stutter stutter
 D-... Did I stutter stutter stutter
 D-... Did I stutter stutter
 D-... Did I?

Ouh na na na stutter
 Ouh na na na did I?
 Ouh na na na
 Yeah
 D-... Did I?
 D-... Did I?
 D-... Did I?
 Have you been singing?

Bring me back to life
 I just can't stand leaving you alone at night
 It's too late to go
 It has taken me forever just to try to know
 One for the money
 Two for the show
 Three to get ready
 And four to go
 Fall back, laugh with me
 Don't know why it took me so long to see

Just stutter, stutter, stutter
 D-... Did I stutter stutter stutter
 D-... Did I stutter stutter stutter
 D-... Did I stutter stutter
 D-... Did I?---Lyrics submitted by Skittles Lover.
