I will softly pull away, in this broken, beautiful mess I've made.
And in the dead of quiet I will slowly fade away in this masterpiece I made.

I'll burn out and slip away.
And this is just a part I portray.
You're beautiful, can I hide in you and stay here?

They keep mostly to themselves; 
Hush now, they'll hurt you until your heart melts.
They know you're lonely and they will only (they'll) break your heart.
And this masterpiece will tear you apart.

I'll burn out and slip away.
And this is just a part I portray.
You're beautiful, can I hide in you and stay here?

First it comes on, creeping, quiet.

And this is just a part I portray.
You're beautiful, can I hide in you and stay here

(Oh and I will) I'll wreck this if I have to.
Tell me, what good would that do?
(Oh I will)I'll wreck this if I have to.
Tell me, what good would that do?
(Oh I, I portay) I'll wreck this if I have to.
Tell me, what good would that do?---Lyrics submitted by Maggie.
