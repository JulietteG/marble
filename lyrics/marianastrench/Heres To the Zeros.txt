Hey kids, do you wanna do what I do?
I got sick, got kicked outta high school
I guess then, I kinda got arrested
With a car and a chase and a drug test

But these days, they dont wanna be near that
'Cause if it's selling records they don't wanna hear that
Clean cut, we do it like Disney
Well adjusted, trusted, trust me

Party anthems get them dancin'
Well Im the king of second chancin
Airbrush, shiny, notoriety
They disappeared into the back to go and get high-ity

Hey, ho
Where did all the good go?
Baby this is where youre dead wrong
Alright
Hey, ho
Heres to all the zeroes
And every misfit
And all my down and outs

You dont sing, you got a young look so
Its nothing autotune cant fix though
MTV dont play videos
And no guitar is allowed on the radio

These days, I kinda just pretend so
I guess I dont mind, it depends though
I get stuck to every innuendo
But it doesnt seem to matter in the end so

They say wheres the next hit baby?
God, how could I top Call Me Maybe?
Well Im delirious, shes bi-curious
Lets disappear into the back to go and get serious

"Hallelujah" up for ransom
Cash value for #anthems
Sing it now

Oh!
Hallelujah up for ransom
Cash value for #anthems
Sing it now
Hallelujah up for ransom
Whoa
Cash value for #hashtag anthems
Hallelujah up for ransom
Cash value for #anthems
Hallelujah up for ransom
Cash value for #anthems---
