And I wondered why you came for all this after so long
When it ripped into you like the son you never were
And I don't think this is what you wanted now

It feels alright but that's a lie that's always near
Sit around and blame the one that put you here
I laughed aloud to drown it out
So I could breathe and feel the space around me
(I'm not kidding anymore)

And I wondered why you never doubted getting there
(so far from here)
When it pulls you down and throws you over, waiting there
Why do you always end up right back here

It feels alright but that's a lie that's always near
Sit around and blame the one that put you here
I laughed aloud to drown it out
So I could breathe and feel the space around me
(I'm not kidding anymore)

You always end up here
You always end up here
You always end up---Lyrics submitted by alice.
