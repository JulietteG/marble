So here's another day,
I'll spend away from you.
Another night,
I'm running,
Another broken avenue.

My bag is ripped and worn,
But then again that's all I..
Take what you wanna take.
What you wanna take.
What you..

I miss the stupid things,
We'd go to sleep and then.
You'd wake me up and kick,
me out of bed at 3am.

Pick up the phone,
and hear you saying,
Dirty things to me.

Do what you wanna do,
Do what you wanna do,
what you..

Take me with you,
I start to miss you,
Take me home,
I don't wanna be alone,
tonight.

Chorus:
And I hate to want to show you,
I will run to you 'til I,
Can't stand on my own anymore,
I cross my heart and hope to die.

cross my heart and hope to die,
cross my heart and hope to...

times are all the same,
you're still away from me,
another day,

Another dollar that i will never see,
Gonna get the peices,
the peices,
pieces of something good,
lie, just a little lie,
just alittle lie,
just a..

I wonder what you doing.,
I wonder if your daddy,
I wonder how we used to,
ever go so long without it.

I don't know where to go,
I'm going back to you,
Be where I ought to be,
where i ought to be,
where i...

Take me with you,
I start to miss you,
take me home,
I don't wanna be alone tonight.

[chorus]

Take me with you,
I start to miss you (x9)

take me home ,
I don't wanna be alone tonight.
