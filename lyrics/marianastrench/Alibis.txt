from the scrapes and bruises 
to the familiar abuses
i'll kick and scream but it never changes anything

and i could spill my guts out 
wearing my best little girl pout
and i almost missed it but nobody said this was going to be easy

this is not the man i hoped to be and i'm just trying to stop the bleeding
i don't know how to word it, i just started to deserve it
and all my, all my faces are alibis
and me, i'm half the man i wanted to be

most times it all comes out wrong
i don't know the words but i'll hum along
there's nothing familiar here anymore 
to anyone or anything enough to feel alive

and i still taste that sickness
and it makes me crazy without it at best
but i'm in the same place i used to be 
but i'm trying harder not to be

this is not the man i hoped to be and i'm just trying to stop the bleeding
i don't know how to word it, i just started to deserve it
and all my, all my faces are alibis
and me, i'm half the man i wanted to be

so what am i 
and all my, all my faces are alibis
this is not the man i hoped to be and i'm just trying to stop the bleeding
i don't know how to words go
i just started not to say no

don't want it, don't get it, 
i know you won't regret it
don't surface, don't surface, 
and i feel so damned worthless
another day is gone and all my faces are alibis
all my faces are alibis

and me, i'm half the man i wanted to be---Lyrics submitted by Jenna.
