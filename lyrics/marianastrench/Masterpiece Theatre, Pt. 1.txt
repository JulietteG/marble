First it comes on quiet creeping slow 
Clever words and phrases only stain
I remain so lost and buried under everything that I need 
When all I want is you

I've been here so very long
And every word is calculated never questioned or debated
All these practiced poses I could wreck it if I had to
But I'm the wreck so what would that do,
My masterpiece will fall apart; it was over before the start

If I burn out and slip away
If this is just a part I portray
If this is just a part I portray
You're beautiful, can I hide in you awhile
If this is just a part I portray
If this is just a part I portray

They keep mostly to themselves
Don't make a sound in case they hear you.
It only hurts me to be near you
Keep those tired eyes closed careful follow my instruction
And I will show you self-destruction
This masterpiece is only mine, entirely guilty by design

If I burn out and slip away
If this is just a part I portray
If this is just a part I portray
You're beautiful, can I hide in you awhile
If this is just a part I portray
Can I hide in you awhile

Just can't let it, let it out
Oh, I just can't let it out (x4)

If this is just a part I portray
You're beautiful, can I hide in you awhile
You're beautiful

If this is just a part I portray 
If this is just a part I portray 
I don't know how it got this way---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
