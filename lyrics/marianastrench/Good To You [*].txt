Everyone's around, no words are coming out.
And I can't find my breathe, can we just say the rest with no sound.
And I know this isn't enough, I still don't measure up.
And I'm not prepared, sorry is never there when you need it.
And I do want you know I hold you up above everyone.
And I do want you know I think you'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you.
I would.

Thought I saw a sign, somewhere between the lines.
Maybe it's me, maybe I only see, what I want.
But I still have your letter, just got caught between
Someone I just invented, and who I really am?
and who I've become

And I do want you know I hold you up above everyone.
And I do want you know I think you'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you.
Woahh
You bring me higher.
Yeah.
I would.

And I do want you know I hold you up above everyone.
And I do want you know I think you'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you.
I'd be good to you,
I'd be good to you,
I'd be good to you...---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
