Can I have your attention? Oh-oh-ooh Oh-oh-ooh Oh-ooh
I just open my mouth
Is it clear?
Is it loud for you?

You just need me to be stable
But I won't be able
To keep it together again
Now don't pretty please me
You're not making it easy to slow me down

It's no wonder
I'm not eating
I'm not sleeping
You say
Sing, sing to me
Sing me something I need
Sing new, sing good
God I wish that I could

Are you hearing me now? Oh-oh-ooh Oh-oh-ooh Oh-ooh
Hear the sad little sounds 
As they fall from my mouth

You just need me to be stable
But I won't be able
To keep it together again
Now don't pretty please me
You're not making it easy to slow me down

No wonder
I'm not eating
I'm not sleeping
You say
Sing, sing to me
Sing me something I need
Sing new, sing good
God I wish that I could

All my indecision
All of my excess
Don't you ever tell me I'm not lovin' you best
I just need a minute
I just need a breath
You're very hard to drink to my continued success

Do I have your attention? Woah! 

You just need me to be stable
But I won't be able
To keep it together again
(Together again)
Now don't pretty please me
You're not making it easy to slow me down

It's no wonder
I'm not eating
I'm not sleeping
You say
Sing, sing to me
Sing me something I need
Sing new, sing good
God I wish that I could

All my indecision (Sing sing to me)
All of my excess
Don't you ever tell me I'm not lovin' you best (Sing sing to me)
All my indecision (Sing sing to me)
All of my excess
Don't you ever tell me I'm not lovin' you best (Sing, sing to me)

God I wish that I could
