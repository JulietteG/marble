Tear those pictures off the wall 
I dont think I will need them all again 
I think the problem here is there's nothing wrong 
I guess that I can coast along for now 
A bit more, there's something missing 
I'm missing the point I did before 

I'm sorry, that I'm always the one to let you down again 
And I feel so ashamed, this should have been easy (I feel so low) 
And I want you to know, that I wanna go again (I feel so low) 

You were first to knock me down 
In a way I guess we're even now
And I know I only used that first to justify 
But maybe that's not just a lie who knows 
A bit more, there's something missing
I'm missing the point I did before 
I'm sorry that I'm always the one to make you feel that burn 

And I feel so ashamed, this used to be easy (I feel so low)
and I want you to know, that I wanna go again (I feel so low)

I feel so tired, tired
You get so tired, tired
You get so tired, tired
Tired, tired

And I feel so ashamed, this should have been easy (I feel so low)
And I want you to know, that I wanna go again (I feel so low)

And I feel so ashamed, this used to be easy (I feel so low)
But I want you to know, I wanna go again (I feel so low)---Lyrics submitted by Jenna.
