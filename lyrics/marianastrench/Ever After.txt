Once upon a time
I used to romanticize 
Used to be somebody, never mind
I don't miss it that much now
I think it's sinking in 
The days that I wonder where I've been
And picture perfect porcelain
But I won't lose a pound

You say I will make a better liar
And never face the music when it's dire
And I breathe disaster, ever after
Don't pull away from me now

Don't you move
Can't you stay where you are, just for now 
I could be your perfect disaster 
You could be my ever after
You could be my ever after, after all 
I could be your perfect disaster
You could be my ever after

Apologies, I'm not myself but I can guarantee 
That when I get back, you won't believe 
That you know me well 
Don't want to think about it 
I'm fuckin' tired of getting sick about it 
Now stand back up and be a man about it 
And fight for something, fight for something, fight for something, oh 

And make a better liar 
And never face the music when it's dire
And I breathe disaster, ever after 
Don't pull away from me now 

Don't you move 
Can't you stay where you are, just for now 
I could be your perfect disaster 
You could my ever after 
Now you could be my ever after, after all 
I could be your perfect disaster 
You could be my ever after

Nobody told ya' this is gonna fold ya'
We'll go marching in like toy soldiers
You're having to hold your own, soldier
We're marching like toy soldiers

Somehow don't you dare fail, fail me now, ever after 
Somehow don't you dare fail, fail me now, ever after 
Somehow 

(Face the music when it's dire)

Once upon a time
This place was beautiful and mine
But now it's just a bottom line
Barely comes to mind
But ever after what is mine

I'll be your disaster, ever after
So fire away
Goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Shaelyn Miller.
