Death valley queen where have you been
Since they crowned you in glory
Filled your head with dreams
But it still goes to show in every desert
There's a rose that's blooming for all to be seen
I remember you well from that town
You did dwell with the face of an angel
In a dump hot as hell
When I asked for a kiss
You kindly dismissed
So i lead my poor heart to the slaughter
Tell me dear what did you fear
I'd do you no wrong though no stranger to sin
So death valley queen go marry your king
Or an old maid you'll end up for certain

Off I did set on my trail of regret
Where I thought of you now in your castle and crown
So I found me a whore with a face just like yours
After several gallons of porter
When I awoke, she had scarpered I was broke
Laying cold in the bed with a whale for a head
So death valley queen go marry your king
Or an old maid you'll end up for certain

Then the ball dropped why everything fell by the way
As your teardrops were falling I forgot to say
That I have always loved you
Yeah I have always loved you
Yeah I
Yeah I
I have always loved you

When I returned downtrodden and burned
There were billy goats grazing
Where once you'd be found
So I hung out to dry
On this limb for a lie
Take me back for I'm cursed on the mainland
Tell me dear what did you fear
I'd do you no wrong though no stranger to sin
So death valley queen go marry your king
Or an old maid you'll end up for certain
I said death valley queen go marry your king
And a-roving I'll end up for certain---
