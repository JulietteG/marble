Looking Down Through A Tide Of No Return,
Is A Field Where The Crops No Longer Grow.
Parched Is The Land,
Strangled And Be Damned.

There For The Grace Of God Go I.

Down Beside Where The Riverbed Sleeps,
Is A Man Not Knowing What He Should Feel.
Marked By The Wave,
That Beats The Water's Edge.

There For The Grace Of God
There For The Grace Of God
There For The Grace Of God Go I.

If I Ever Hurt Another Like Thee Again,
I Would Drown Myself Beneath Your Name.
Lost Was the Child
We All Once Did Hide.

There For The Grace Of God
There For The Grace Of God
There For The Grace Of God Go I.---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
