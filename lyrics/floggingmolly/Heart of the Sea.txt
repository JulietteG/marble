Stick and stones, a few clam living bones
Salt and water melt my skin
If you don't set sail, you'll end up in the belly of a whale
No swallow saint will mock your grave

Every light of every day
It's a way into decay

But I won't cry myself to sleep
'Cause my soul no longer weeps
But my body lies in the heart of the sea

Darkness breaks and we heard the morning wakes
She marks us weary as we drown
Show no remorse as you will make a beautiful course
Let's do the one you love the most

Every light of every day
It's a way into decay

Don't fornicate
With the one you love to hate
You'll wind up dead before she vows

But I won't cry myself to sleep
'Cause my soul no longer weeps
While my body lies in the heart of the sea

Another useless confrontation
Leaves any A-class confirmation
Now the end appears
And my eyes are filled with fear

I am blind, I am blind, take me up before I die
Don't wanna end up in the heart of the sea
Oh, I am blind, I am blind, take me up before I die
I don't wanna end up in the heart of the sea

Now the lesson is lesson is learnt
Don't you remember the fire from your burns
Walk, it's better even truly feel

But I won't cry myself to sleep
'Cause my soul no longer weeps
While my body lies in the heart

But I won't cry myself to sleep
'Cause my soul no longer weeps
While my body lies in the heart of the sea
Heart of the sea---Lyrics submitted by Narf Blinko.
