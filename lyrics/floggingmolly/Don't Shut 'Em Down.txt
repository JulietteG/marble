Sad days, Kissing the cheeks
of the families who are walking away
Tragic, the pubs are opposing
The System is broken, decay

Because Business is down at the depot,
Defences are the only things built
Neighbours wave goodbye to each other
This country is over, they say

Yeh, this is life
In a modern town
The windows smashed open with the doors kicked out
It's not a good day left to be in a fight
'Cause living is hard through the struggles of life
If nothing gets done it will never be right
But don't shut 'em down

Lately, the 21st century's been....Crazy
It's a sign of the times
Buildings decomposing in slumber
There's no work for all till they wake

Yeh, this is life
In a modern town
The windows smashed open with the doors kicked out
It's not a good day left to be in a fight
'Cause living is hard through the struggles of life
If nothing gets done it will never be right
But don't shut 'em down
Don't shut 'em down

Too many faults, no reasons
the rains that fall, dry bleeding
Upon the ashes of our homes
Our homes
Save our homes

Manic
The word on the street here is panic
There's a riot at hand

People, taking care of the people
There's no other way, or we'll break

Yeh, this is life
In a modern town
The windows smashed open with the doors kicked out
It's not a good day left to be in a fight
'Cause living is hard through the struggles of life
Yeh, this is life
In a modern town
The windows smashed open with the doors kicked out
It's not a good day left to be in a fight
'Cause living is hard through the struggles of life
If nothing gets done it will never be right
But don't shut 'em down
Don't shut 'em down

Sad days, kissing the cheeks of the families (you can't shut 'em down)
Sad days, kissing the cheeks of the families (you can't shut 'em down)---Lyrics submitted by Narf Blinko.
