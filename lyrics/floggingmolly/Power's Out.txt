From the town of Detroit where my job is secure yeah
Secure in the fact now that it's gone for good yeah
So I'll scrimp and I'll scrape at this pension I saved
So it should be gone by the end of the day

Yeah the power's out
Is there no luck in sight?
Yeah the power's out
Hope it's just for the night
Yeah the power's out
Another kick in the head
I'm so poor at this living I'd be richer off...

Wrap me up in your silver then roll me in gold yeah
Then ice up this whiskey 'til it's nice and cold yeah
Forgive me for dreaming it's all I have left
Except this pending foreclosure and mountains of debt

Yeah the power's out
Well there's fuck all to see
Yeah the power's out
Like this economy
Yeah the power's out
Guess it's par for the course
Unless you're a blood sucking leech CEO, CEO

So I guess the good lord has forgotten about me
And me like himself my old trade's carpentry
I could build him a cross with one hand behind back
And the other three nails 'case he gives me the sack

Yeah the power's out
The poor dog has left home
Yeah the power's out
Couldn't 'ford him a bone
Yeah the power's out
It's the trickle effect
Today it's just me but tomorrow ye rest

Yeah the power's out
Yeah the power's out
Yeah the power's out
Yeah the power...

So don't spend your taxes on men on the moon yeah
We've been there before and we left pretty soon yeah
The grass will be greener one day I expect
When the earth will catch fire then replenish itself

From the town of Detroit where we fight 'til we drop yeah
We don't want your pity we just want a job yeah
There's no shame in us asking with some self-respect
But don't leave it much longer; we're human at best

Yeah the power's out
Well there's fuck all to see
Yeah the power's out
Like this economy
Yeah the power's out
Guess it's par for the course
Unless you're a blood sucking leech CEO, CEO, CEO, CEO
The CEO must go

Yeah the power's out
Yeah the power's out
Yeah the power's out
Yeah the power's out
Power's out, the power's out
From the town of Detroit where we fight 'til we drop
From the town of Detroit where my job is secure
'Cause the power's out---Lyrics submitted by Narf Blinko.
