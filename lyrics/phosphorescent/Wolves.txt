Mama there's wolves in the house
Mama they won't let me out
Mama they're mating at night
Mama they wont make nice

They're pacing and glowing bright
Their faces all snowy and white
Bury their paws in the stone
Make for my heart as their home

They tumble and fight
And they're beautiful
On the hilltops at night
They are beautiful

Blazing with light
Is the whitest and the tallest and the biggest one
She's muscled and fine
When she runs

They're tearing up holes in the house
They're tearing their claws in the ground
They're staring with blood in their mouths
Mama they won't let me out

They tumble and fight
And they're beautiful
On the hilltops at night
They are beautiful

Blazing with light
Is the whitest and the tallest and the biggest one
All muscled and fine
When she runs

Mama there's wolves in the house
Mama i tried to put them out
And mama i know you're too wise
To wait till those wolves make nice---Lyrics submitted by Wesley Pokorney.
