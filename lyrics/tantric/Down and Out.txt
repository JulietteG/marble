Coming up for air so I can
Check myself again and I stand
Proven to the man sheltered
Confidence we tend to shelf and
Unexpected hunger drives me
Just shut up and stand beside me
I don't need your understanding
I don't need to change a damn thing

Though I'm used to have you here
It's doesn't change the man I was
When you found me
And there was no one else around me yeah
Just turn the page and watch me grow
There's so many things that you dont know
About my soul
Live and die but this will not get old

Just when you think that you're down and out
Don't preconceive what I'm all about
Look for a reason that you have to start
Acting like a friend that you are not

And when you think that we played it out
We come from the bottom and knock it out
Look for a reason that you have to start
Acting like a friend but you are not

Nothing in-between to fall through
I'm being myself who are you
You stand above and look down
You're just a plagaristic clown
You suck the life out of me
You keep track of the petty
And when this well becomes dry
You'll she'd a tear for another lie
Though I'm used to have you here
It's doesn't change the man I was
When you found me
And there was no one else around me yeah
Just turn the page and watch me grow
There's so many things that you don't know
About my soul
Live and die but this will not get old

Just when you think that your down and out
Don't preconceive what I'm all about
Look for a reason that you have to start
Acting like a friend that you are not

And when you think that we played it out
We come from the bottom and knock it out
Look for a reason that you have to start
Acting like a friend but you are not

Though I'm used to have you here
It's doesn't change the man I was
When you found me
And there was no one else around me
Yeah, yeah oooh

Just when you think that your down and out
Don't preconceive what I'm all about
Look for a reason that you have to start
Acting like a friend that you are not

And when you think that we played it out
We come from the bottom and knock it out
Look for a reason that you have to start
Acting like a friend but you are not---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
