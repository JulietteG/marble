I'm a victim of circumstance always willing to take a chance
A unique individual and my pain is residual

With theres duality to i say f*** this calamity
I'm aware of my sanity but inside I don't wanna be

I've got this world on my shoulders weighing down like a boulder
All these things that I'm questioning is the sum above everything

Oh I'm bitchin' about this now try releasing but don't know how
I accept the way that idea even though I know I can give now

If I am not the one
Still I won't step aside
What have I become?
A victim of a foolish pride
If I am not the one
Then tell me why I act this way
Your one begotten son
Has made everything you feel

With all the glamor and glory well I'm not leavin don't worry
There's so much more to the story cause I'm an infinite quarry

Ohh this is my only version of what I see and imagine
Everything I am witnessing. Hey! Is anyone listening?

Its too late to be lookin' back. Its the ways we can react
A mind is so pitying don't you follow that reasoning?

Owww your struggle is where we shine I wont let this be left behind
There's a purpose for everything with the thinkin' we strengthening now

If I am not the one
Still I won't step aside
What have I become?
A victim of a foolish pride
If I am not the one
Then tell me why I act this way
Your one begotten son
Has made everything you feel

If I am not the one
Still I won't step aside
What have I become?
A victim of a foolish pride
If I am not the one
Then tell me why I act this way
Your one begotten son
Has made everything you feel

If I am not the one
Still I won't step aside
What have I become?
Victim of a foolish pride---Lyrics submitted by Hillary.
