So here you are you're knockin' at my door with saddened eyes
The color is the same but there's a change
The difference is between the little lies I've told 
To keep a peace. You know the love was still the same

Oh it's better in life to lose a minute
Then have to go through life and really never get to live it
Your premade path is just an illusion
I'm sick of all your dirty lies that cause this confusion

I never wanna hear another love song
It's all all bunch of lies and I've been through it all
I know its like I'm bitter, I don't give a shit
I hope you're really happy and you choke on it
I never wanna hear another love poem
Or claiming all your love in truth was done
I know it's like I'm bitter, I dont give a shit
I hope you're really happy and you choke on it

God forgive me for these random things
The little things I do, it's really not my truth
Everything is overwhelming me, constantly deserping me
'Til I get away from you

It's better in life to lose a minute
Then have to go through life and really never get to live it

I never wanna hear another love song
It's all all bunch of lies and I've been through it all
I know its like I'm bitter, I don't give a shit
I hope you're really happy and you choke on it
I never wanna hear another love poem
Or claiming all your love in truth was done
I know it's like I'm bitter, I don't give a shit
I hope you're really happy and you choke on it

And I smile as you listen and you're thinking to yourself
You're the reason why your living in this pain

I never wanna hear another love song
It's all all bunch of lies and I've been through it all
I know its like I'm bitter, I don't give a shit
I hope you're really happy and you choke on it
I never wanna hear another love poem
Or claiming all your love in truth was done
I know it's like I'm bitter, I don't give a shit
I hope you're really happy and you choke on it

I never wanna hear another love song
It's all all bunch of lies and I've been through it all
I know its like I'm bitter, I don't give a shit
I hope you're really happy and you choke on it
I never wanna hear another love poem
Or claiming all your love in truth was done
I know it's like I'm bitter, I don't give a shit
I hope you're really happy and you choke on it
On it
On it
On it, on it, on it
I hope you choke on it---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
