I'm a victim of circumstance always willing to take a chance 
A unique individual and my pain is residual 

Living with this duality to i say f*** this calamity 
I'm aware of my sanity but inside I don't wanna be 

I've got this world on my shoulders weighing down like a boulder 
All these things that I'm questioning is the sum above everything 

Oh I'm bitchin' about this now try releasing but don't know how 
I accept the way that I live even though I know I can give now 

If I am not the one 
Still I won't step aside 
What have I become? 
A victim of a foolish pride 
If I am not the one 
Then tell me why I act this way 
Your one begotten son 
Is pain everything you feel 

With all the glamour and glory well I'm not leavin don't worry 
There's so much more to this story cause I'm an infinite quarry 

Ohh this is my only version of what I see and I'm merging 
Everything I am witnessing. Hey! Is anyone listening? 

Its too late to be lookin' back. there's two ways that we can react 
Never mind the self pitying don't you follow that reasoning 

Under struggle is where we shine I wont let this be left behind 
There's a purpose for everything without thinkin' we strengthening now 

If I am not the one 
Still I won't step aside 
What have I become? 
A victim of a foolish pride 
If I am not the one 
Then tell me why I act this way 
Your one begotten son 
Is pain everything you feel 

If I am not the one 
Still I won't step aside 
What have I become? 
A victim of a foolish pride 
If I am not the one 
Then tell me why I act this way 
Your one begotten son 
Is pain everything you feel 

If I am not the one 
Still I won't step aside 
What have I become? 
Victim of a foolish pride---Lyrics submitted by ELIZA.
