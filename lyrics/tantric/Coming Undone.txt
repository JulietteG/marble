well...
hey where you goin to
im not done with you
tell me what you wanna do
never been afraid of you
just because you walk around
everyone your talking down
dont you even make a sound
i will drop you to the ground

hey you better watch with the stare
i see you coming undone
come on come on
come on and get some
hey you better watch with the stare
i see you coming undone
come on come on
come on and get some

come on and get some

come on and get some

i will intimidate
 to the point that i frustrate
never seen this side of me
let the anger out of me
just because ive been reserved
many things you havent heard
doesnt mean im not aware
if you push ill take you there

hey you better watch with the stare
i see you coming undone
come on come on
come on and get some
hey you better watch with the stare
i see you comeing undone
come on come on
come on and get some
hey you better watch with the stare
i see you coming undone
come on come on
come on and get some
hey you better watch with the stare
i see you coming undone
come on come on
come on and get some

hey you better watch with the stare
i see you coming undone
come on come on 
come on and get some
hey you better watch with the stare 
i see you coming undone
come on come on 
come on and get some
hey you better watch with the stare 
i see you coming undone
come on come on
come on and get some
hey you better watch with the stare
i see you comeing undone
come on come on
come on and get some
hey you better watch with the stare 
i see you comeing undone
come on come on
come on and get some
hey you better watch with the stare
i see you coming undone
come on come on
come on and get some---Lyrics submitted by alicia.
