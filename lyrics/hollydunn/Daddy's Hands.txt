I remember Daddy's hands, 
folded silently in prayer 
And reaching out to hold me, 
when I had a nightmare 
You could read quite a story, 
in the callouses and lines 
Years of work and worry 
had left their mark behind 

I remember Daddy's hands, 
how they held my Mama tight 
And patted my back, 
for something done right 
There are things that I've forgotten, 
that I loved about the man 
But I'll always remember 
the love in Daddy's hands 

Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin' 
Daddy's hands, were hard as steel 
when I'd done wrong 
Daddy's hands, weren't always gentle 
But I've come to understand 
There was always love 
in Daddy's hands 

I remember Daddy's hands 
, working 'til they bled 
Sacrificed unselfishly, 
just to keep us all fed 
If I could do things over, 
I'd live my life again 
And never take for granted 
the love in Daddy's hands 

Daddy's hands were soft and kind 
when I was cryin' 
Daddy's hands, were hard as steel 
when I'd done wrong 
Daddy's hands, weren't always gentle 
But I've come to understand 
There was always love in Daddy's hands 

Daddy's hands were soft and kind 
when I was cryin' 
Daddy's hands, were hard as steel 
when I'd done wrong 
Daddy's hands, weren't always gentle 
But I've come to understand 
There was always love 
In Daddy's hands---
