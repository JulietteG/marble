[Chorus]
Women Lie, Men Lie
Women Lie, Men Lie
Women Lie, Men Lie
Numbers dont lie!
(x 6)

[Yo Gotti]
Ay, step up in the party and them bad b-tches be on me,
I be sippin on Patrone, when Im jumpin out ferraris,
i be rocking Gucci sometimes Louie, Im retarded,
., and the shades by Bacaray
hatin on my drop I got my mind on my money,
Milan on, taking nothing from me,
hated on these , hated on these.,

ballin is my hobby, damn homie going shoppin,
got 5 star with me and . in the lobby,
took her to the room, she hit me with that line,
she aint that type of girl so I told her stop lying,

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Young money, yeah, ok,
I aint gotta lie, cross my heart hope to die,
the numbers dont lie, G-5 ,
I f-cked her p-ssy good, make her cry if I tried,
Im tired of being sick and Im sick of being tired,
tired of these n-ggas and tired of these b-tches,
sh-t let em lie as long as they aint snitching,
and men lie about women,
and sh-t women lie about plenty,
They aint lying on me Im in the bed with 2 fine b-tches lying on me,
so that would make 3 and numbers dont lie,
and money dont lie,
and neither do I,
B-tch!

[Chorus]

(the numbers dont lie, the the numbers dont lie)

[Yo Gotti]
Im trying to count to a billion,
my b-tch Brazilian,
hop in that Lamb,
push the button lose the ceiling,
sun out no raindrops,
posting the same spot,
right here in north north memphis,
is where I came from,
hundred on the neck, I aint never had sh-t,
the streets gave me family, Barry White couldnt,
aint no secret in the streets,
n-ggas know I got ,
got swagger through the roof,
I was born ,
zip code on my wrist,
phone number in the bank,
in my ten til six
with my 305 paint
I got my 357 and my 501s,
and Lear 55 with my air force ones.

[Chorus]
Yo this your boy Yo Gotti
