[Intro: Yo Gotti]
Im going going back back to the Bay
Rest in peace Mac Dre, all I do is talk yay

[Bridge: yo Gotti]
In the club got them bottles on replay
Tryna break a record like a DJ
Thats a hundred fifty bottles in one night
I get a pistol mack act right

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Act right, act right
Money dont fold if it aint right
Act right, act right
Niggas playin games you can act right

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Im goin goin back back to the Bay
Rest in peace Mac Dre, Im a street nigga all I do is talk yay
Want me in your city nigga know they gon pay
Aint lookin for a freak though, lookin for a freak hoe
Huberlink chain on my neck wear a kilo?
Nigga just violated pissed to the thirty to his..
On the real nigga on a scale of one to ten you a zero
Damn, that a bad bitch you a Creole
On the West coast the bitch say she from the N.O.
Act right, get your life changed
Fuck a purse you can get the last name
Real nigga shit boy I hate lames
All my nigga sell dope or gang bang
Me and cash get the act right
Bein a phony you dont look right

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Imma tell ya off top mother fuck free Boose
Ridin in my Lamborghini with the dope man
Thinkin came with a step might be the shit
I got a rooster in my Rari might be your bitch
I said I pull to detention a vintador
Make you bitch pass out straight hit the floor
Said I never seen a car like that before
Whats that thang stickin up? thats the door
I told YG Imma go ride the whip
You just hangin out the window ghost ride the clip
I made my first quarter million dollars off the blow
He want a nine piece chicken took that to-go
Imma tell ya like this, yall motherfucker listen
Kilo all day motherfucker Im trippin
If you run up on me think Im slippin
Michael Jordan with the chopper man I hit you like Pippen act right

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YG]
Goin goin back back to the bank
Rest in peace to myself
Imma fly nigga nigga I take your ho
I had the Louie V she did me like Coco
The devil talkin to me, but I dont hear him
Act like Im deaf like So-So
Fuck you, fuck him, fuck them
Fuck my ex with a pogos
Hundred bottles in the cup, no Weezy
Niggas start trippin boom bow dope fiend
Fendi on my shoes, Fendi on my belt
Im in the Fendi store I dont need help
All gold everything like Trinidad
I went to high school with your bitch with a rack
I dont got money problems, I got trust issues
Two things I gotta stay is with the two pistols

[Bridge]
