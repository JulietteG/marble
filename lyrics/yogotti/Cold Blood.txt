(feat. J. Cole & Canei Finch)

[Hook: Canei Finch]
Started from the ground
Building to the sky now
Watch it fall down
How you gon survive now?
Yeah, its cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
If I could paint a picture
I would show the image of a dog ass niigga
Yeah, raw ass nigga
 Popping pain killers
 Ridin' for the cause
 For dogs with them pistols, natural born killas
 He sold crack to his mother
 Turned his back on his brothers
 Killed his partner for the plug he think errthing a hustle
 Cold mothafucka, holmes numb, black heart, no feelings, just a gun
 He was raised in the trenches
 Not to mention all the hoes that had dissed him, 
So Holmes think the whole world against him
 Played Ball, coach benched him
 Grandpa Klan lynched him
 He was raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis
 Kinda hard to adapt
 So holmes turned to a strap
 Didn't succeed, tried rap, couldn't fight, got slapped
 Shot dice, do crap, did time, back out, damn

[Hook: Canei Finch]
Started from the ground
Building to the sky now
Watch it fall down
How you gon survive now?
Yeah, its cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Heres a voice for the voiceless
My words like multiple choice to the choiceless
Emerge like a search light in the darkness
For this young, black carcass
My niggas either join the Armed Forces, or they corpses now
In God we trust But its bucks that we worship, now
Boy that root of evil gon forever rule the people
See, I seen just what that fast money gon come and do to people
Hit a lick, it was a hit
He said, Let's go and do the sequel
But his, nigga wasnt bout it, nigga wasnt bout it, now
Feeling guilty, "What would Momma think about me?"
Told em, think about it nigga, won't you think about it now?
But he was money hungry
Plus he trigger happy
So they hopped up in the Caddy
Burnt his pack, just like a Stevian
Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM
Momma in denial, like her baby boy on trial
For a murder that he aint commit
Tears soak the handkerchief

[Hook: Canei Finch]
Started from the ground
Building to the sky now
Watch it fall down
How you gon survive now?
Yeah, its cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
For real, for real

[Outro: J. Cole]
They say the good die young, thats the truth
My nigga floating up in heaven now, thats the proof
I aint make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga maybe we can fly someday
Oh we can fly someday
Yeah up in the sky someday
Do real niggas get to heaven?
Thats that shit I ask the reverend---Lyrics submitted by ANGEL BRANNON.
