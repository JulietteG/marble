You could be my favourite taste
To touch my tongue
I know someone who can serve me love
But it wouldnt fill me up
You could have my favourite face
And favourite name
I know someone who could play the part
But it wouldnt be the same
No it wouldnt be the same
No it wouldnt be the same
No it wouldnt be the same
With you

You could be my favourite place
Ive ever been
I got lost in your willingness
To dream within the dream
You could be my favourite faded fantasy
Ive hung my happiness upon what it all could be
And what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
With you

What it all what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
With you

You could hold the secrets that save
Me from myself
I could love you more than love could
All the way from hell
You could be my poison my cross
My razor blade
I could love you more than life
If I wasnt so afraid
Of what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
Of what it all what it all could be
With you

What it all what it all could be
Of what it all what it all could be
What it all what it all could be
With you

Loved is all that bloomed
Always what you did
Never let someone go or they
I ain't never loved like you
I've never loved I've never loved
Ive never loved loved loved like you
Ive never loved
Ive never loved
Ive never loved---
