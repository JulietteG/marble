We've wanted to be trusty and true
But feathers fell from our wings
And we've wanted to be worthy of you
But weather rained on our dreams

And we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So fellas, lay down your fears
'Cause we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So let us start from here

'Cause we never wanted to be lusty or lewd
Nor tethered to prudish strings
And we never wanted to be jealously tuned
Nor withered into ugly things

But we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So fellas, lay down your spears
'Cause we can't take back
What is done, what is past
So let us start from here

And if all that you are
Is not all you desire,
Then, come

Come, let yourself be wrong
Come, it's already begun

Come, come alone
Come with fear, come with love
Come however you are
Just come, come alone
Come with friends, come with foes
Come however you are
Just come, come alone
Come with me, then let go
Come however you are
Just come, come alone
Come so carefully closed
Come however you are
Just come

Come, come along
Come with sorrows and songs
Come however you are
Just come, come along
Come, let yourself be wrong
Come however you are
Just come---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
