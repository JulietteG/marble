Why settle when it comes to love 
You cant make more than whats barely enough 
And why did I cheat myself 
By lyin to my heart that theres no one else 
I guess it was still learnin its okay to want the best 
To hold out for perfection and damn the rest 

I want fireworks 
Like the 4th of July 
And love thats true blue 
Like a clear summer sky 
I want passion so strong 
That it makes me wanna cry 
I want nothing short of 
Butterflies 

Yeah butterflies 
Im sorry it took me so long 
To figure out Im worth it 
And true loves worth waitin on 
Forgive me, youre the only one who can 
Cause youre the only heart, 
The only heart Ill ever have 
And I dont wanna break you 
Or leave you on my sleeve 
I just want to save you 
Cause I want what you need 

I want fireworks 
Like the 4th of July 
And love thats true blue 
Like a clear summer sky 
I want passion so strong 
That it makes me wanna cry 
I want nothing short of 
Butterflies 

I wanna feel the lightness of my soul 
Ill be half until im whole 
And when its really love Ill know 
Oh yeah 

I dont wanna break you 
Or leave you on my sleeve 
I just wanna save you 
Cause I want what you need 

I want fireworks 
Like the 4th of July 
And love thats true blue 
Like a clear summer sky 
I want passion so strong 
That it makes me wanna cry 
I want nothing short of 
Butterflies 

Yeah, butterflies 
Oo 
I want fireworks 
Like the 4th of July 
I want true blue 
Like a clear summer sky---Lyrics submitted by Adrianne.
