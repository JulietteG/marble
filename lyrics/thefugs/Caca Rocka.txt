"Down in the subway, come from a dance,
Lookin' for a toilet, gonna shit my pants!
Uh uhhhhh, uh uhhhhhh, baby uh uhhhhhh.

Dig in my pocket, lookin' for a coin,
All I find is three pennies and a joint!
Uh uhhhhh, uh uhhhhhh, baby uh uhhhhhh.

Out of my skull, kickin' the door,
I don't have a dime, I'm gonna do it on the floor!
Uh uhhhhh, uh uhhhhhh, baby uh uhhhhhh.

Along come a cop, big as a tent,
You don't get no shit, for just three cents!
Uh uhhhhh, uh uhhhhhh, baby uh uhhhhhh.

If I had a nickel, if I had a dime,
I'd put it in the toilet and I'd shit all the time!
Uh uhhhhh, uh uhhhhhh, baby uh uhhhhhh.---Lyrics submitted by Barry Stock.
