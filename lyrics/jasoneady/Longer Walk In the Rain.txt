I should go back, before I go too far
But I know myself enough to know
That I'll probably stay right here
While the storm clouds roll in
And I'll leave, a little later that I should

Chorus:
And I think about you then
While I stumble home again
And I'll have time to remember who's to blame
Cuz its a longer walk in the rain
Its a longer walk in the rain

Another night is done
And you barely cross my mind
As I watch the clock tick from ten to two
Now the thunder's rolling in
I can feel it in the wind
There's no way to stop this coming down

Chorus

Will the porch light be left on
Will she just be gone
Lord I wonder if she wonders where I've been
Gotta stop this running round 
Before its too late to settle down
Knowing that I'll say the same thing again
