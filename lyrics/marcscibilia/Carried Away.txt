Ah, you do something to me
that takes me out of this world.
and it would be a shame to try and stay, 'cause

Today seems the perfect day
to get carried away, carried away.
Like the wind, blows where it may,
lets get carried away, carried away.

Our busy plans, they all can wait.
Take my hand, we'll get out of this place.
The world could end today, then lets get carried away.

Don't worry about your things, let's just head to the shore.
If you got nothing, you'll never need more.

You can't swim in this river and hold your brick of lead.
Some men get to Heaven, others get rich instead.
Can we leave right now?
'cause eventually this life, yeah, it'll turn us gray.

And today seems the perfect day
to get carried away, carried away.
One look of your face,
I get carried away, I'm carried away

Our busy plans, they all can wait.
Life's a drag to those who hesitate.
The world could end today, then lets get carried away

Today seems the perfect day
to get carried away, carried away.
Like the wind, blows where it may,
lets get carried away, carried away.

Our busy plans, they all can wait.
Take my hand, we'll get out of this place.
The world could end today, 
we better get carried away---Lyrics submitted by Nicholas.
