If only I could show you
Just how much I really care
Everyday I'm torn apart
Not knowing if you're even there

Yet again
You're a testimony
Now and then
That a greatness occasionally can come along

Wherever I stand
You're the one
Who'll be right there with me
Wherever I land
You're the one
Who'll be there to break my fall

Whether fast or slow
If only I could know you
So every way I feel
A part of something like you always do

Yet again
You're my sanctuary
How and when
That a greatness eternally does come along

Wherever I stand
You're the one
Who'll be right there with me
Wherever I land
You're the one
Who'll be there to break my fall

Wherever I stand, wherever I stand
You're the one
Who'll be right there with me
Wherever I land
You're the one
Who'll be there to break my fall

No matter where
No matter how
I know that you'll be
There by my side
It feels so right

The sting you share
The fact I'm found
I know more about
What lies inside us gives me life

Wherever I stand
You're the one
Who'll be right there with me
Wherever I land
You're the one
Who'll be there to break my fall

Wherever I stand, wherever I stand
You're the one
Who'll be right there with me
Wherever I land
You're the one---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
