What if we haven't lost our way,
What if we haven't lost our minds,
And chose to seize the day,
What if we know just how to rise and shine,
What if we see our circumstances now start at the end

So here we go again,
A past worth savin,
At last we're pavin,
The path less taken;

Why not believe in making change,
Why not perceive through open blinds,
Why not be free to go and play,
Why not adventure out to find our eyes,
Why not ignore a broken promise is still just a lie;

So here we go again,
A past worth savin,
At last we're pavin,
The path less taken;x2


We breathe in time, we bleed through second chances,
Believe inside, that nothing matters if
everything just stays the same 

So here we go again,
A past worth savin,
At last we're pavin,
The path less taken;x2---Lyrics submitted by lexi.
