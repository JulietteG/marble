Tryinna' remember the very last time
I felt a simple thing going past
Was it the day in north Georgia
You were trying to take her back?
She sees the Day Lily's for sale sign
And the tears spring to her eyes
You turn the car around and your headed back down that track

She's had a heart attack
But the bottle of Jack sits on the counter like the devil she knows
And he beats her up and she fills her cup
With the embers of a dying fire glow
See how she looked in her school year book
Her friends signed the margins all around
But would you stay in touch you know I miss you so much
I hope we get out of this town

Every day that you get up and force your cards
Playing your story in fits and starts
Take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down to the stream
And you bloody your hands digging for your dream

I went looking for the answers from someone I heard believes that life gets easier
And you learn how to breathe and you learn how to grieve your past
You study the masters and their books
Giving in to the barbs and hooks
Till you except it with grace when your true love doesn't last

Every day that you get up and force your cards
Playing your story in fits and starts
Take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down to the stream
And you bloody your hands digging for your dream

Every day that you get up and force your cards
You're playing your story in fits and starts
Take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down to the stream
And you bloody your hands digging for your dream

Every day, every day 
That you go down, and down
You have bloodied, you have bloodied your hands

Take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down
Take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down
Take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down---Lyrics submitted by Tasha.
