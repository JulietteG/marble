You can go to the East
To find your, inner hemisphere.
You say we're under the same sky babe,
You're bound to realize, Honey, it's not that clear.
I'm not your promise land
I'm not your promise one
I'm not your Land of Canaan, sweetheart,
Waiting for you under the sun.

I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now.
I'm wanting your love and you're giving it out.
I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight.

Well the meanings changed (for what it's worth),
It's just a senseless game.
I should think of love, but it's fear every time I hear
Your heart strain.
It's not the fallen man,
It's not the call of time,
It's just the London skyline
Telling me you're not mine.

I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now.
I'm wanting your love and you're giving it out.
I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight.

My blood is running dry,
My skin is, my skin is growing thin
For every time you find yourself
You lose a little bit of me, from within.
It's just a raging cycle, why can't we
Bring it all to the end of the line.
From inside this existence, sweetheart,
Time is not on my side.

I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now.
I'm wanting your love and you're giving it out.
I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight, I'm lonely tonight.

I'm not your promised land, I'm not your promised one.
I'm not your promised land, I'm not your promised one.
I'm not your Land of Canaan Sweetheart,
I'm not your Land of Canaan Sweetheart,
I'm not your Land of Canaan Sweetheart,
Waiting for you under the sun, I'm lonely tonight. ---Lyrics submitted by Emily Bratten.
