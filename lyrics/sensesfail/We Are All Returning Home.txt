There is something in my heart
Telling me to let go
Put away all of your armor
It's going to kill me if I want to grow

It's a choice that I must make so I can be free
It's a choice that I must make so I can be free

The times that you take to wait
For all the things that you need
Are the times that you've wasted

The times that you take to wait
For all the things that you need
Are the times that you've wasted

Reach up from the soil and bloom
Go to the places that scare you
Shine the light on what is it that you're not willing do see
We are all returning home
We think we are separate, so we roam
Searching for something to satisfy this thirst
We must turn inward

Do you hear that roaring between your ears
Do you have the courage to listen
Can you make peace with your fear

The times that you take to wait
For all the things that you need
Are the times that you've wasted

The times that you take to wait
For all the things that you need
Are the times that you've wasted

You can wait for death to come
Or you can take a chance and lead
And be like melting snow
Wash away all that you've known

You can wait for death to come
Or you can take a chance and lead
Into the great unknown
Do you fear what you might see---
