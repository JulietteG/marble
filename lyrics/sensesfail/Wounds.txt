Fear, I was so afraid to face the truth and open wide
For fear that I would float away and not been seen

There is a beating in my heart and it is the scariest thing I have ever felt
To know that the difference between joy and sadness is such a small sliver
There is a welling up of emotions inside me that I just can't bare; tears stream down my face
There are moments of extreme joy, there are moments of love, there are moments of madness
And this is life; we cannot change what arises, only how we greet it

The pictures they fade, my horrible memories fade
They burst into fire when I chose to let love be my guide
Depression, anxiety and shame, they almost killed me
Obsession, addiction and pain, they almost killed me

The wounds that never heal are the ones you refuse to see
The wounds that never heal are the ones you refuse to see

Be the change you seek
Be the change you seek
Be the change you seek

The pictures they fade, my horrible memories fade
They burst into fire when I chose to let love be my guide
Depression, anxiety and shame, they almost killed me
Obsession, addiction and pain, they almost killed me

Fear, I was so afraid to face the truth and open wide
For fear that I would float away and not been seen---
