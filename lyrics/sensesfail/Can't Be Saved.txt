Follow your bliss
It reads on my chest
I know I got it tattooed for a reason
Why can't I just hold it true?

'Cause I'm still crashing all the funerals
Of these people that I never knew (yeah)

I'm stuck in a coma
Stuck in a never ending sleep
And some day I will wake up
And realize I made up everything

I shut the door and turn all the lights out
And listen to all the songs that the night shouts
They go something just like this

So
Go fill up a glass with tonic rocks and gin
And drink yourself to happiness

I'm stuck in a coma
Stuck in a never ending sleep
And some day I will wake up
And realize I made up everything

We can all hang ourselves
From gold chandeliers
And drink good bye to all
All the pain and fears
Loose lips have sunk this ship
To a shallow grave
Washed up upon the rocks

I won't be saved
I won't be saved

I'm stuck in a coma
Stuck in a never ending sleep
Some day I will wake up
And realize I gave up everything

So follow your bliss, it reads on my chest
(I won't be saved)
I know i got it tattooed for a reason
(I won't be saved)
I shut the door and turn all the lights out
(I won't be saved)
And listen to all the songs that the night shouts
(I won't be saved)---Lyrics submitted by Will.
