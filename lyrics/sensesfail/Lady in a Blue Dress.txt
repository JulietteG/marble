Just like the lady in a blue dress,
You've got cigarettes on your breath.
Hair spray and some cheap perfume.
I'll put a little sour in your sweet,
You've got so much fucking tongue in cheek.
You want what you could never have.

You say that you want respect
Well then you better get some for yourself.
'Cause all that I see right now,
Is someone who's lost and insecure.

So you say that I am rated X,
You suffer from the lack of sex.
Black heart and your lipstick smeared.
Your points are trite and I'm too sober
To deal with you running over
Your same pathetic cliche lines.

You say that you want respect
Well then you better get some for yourself.
'Cause all that I see right now,
Is someone who's lost and insecure.

Don't try to be cute with me,
'Cause I know you hate yourself
And you'd end your stupid life now
But you're too spineless

Just like the lady in a blue dress
You've got cigarettes on your breath,
Hair spray and some cheap perfume.

You say that you want respect
Well then you better get some for yourself.
'Cause all that I see right now,
Is someone who's lost and insecure. ---Lyrics submitted by Alexis Rae Shank.
