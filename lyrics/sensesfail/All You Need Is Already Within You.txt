You have a heart, don't forget this
It's so easy to become protective
Don't push the world out of the way
Just because you are in pain

You don't have to suffer alone
There is always hope
You don't have to suffer alone
There is always hope

Reach up from that soil
Pull yourself out of your grave
Everything you need is already in reach
How long will you keep on suffering
Before you're sick
How long will you keep on suffering
Before you're sick

All you need is already within you
All you need is already within you
All you need is already within you
All you need is already within you
Pull yourself out of your grave ---
