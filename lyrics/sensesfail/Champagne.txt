so i'm done with all this pain that ive held
like a boxer who's been knocked down and lost his step

the doctor said
i'm sorry son
you can't win
you can't win this one

everybody likes what i need
im standing up above the road so i can see

so im sorry ive been such a mess
and ive promised i will do my best

ive perched myself
of all this pain
like cheap
like cheap champagne

everybody likes what i need
im standing up above the road so i can see
everybody likes what i need
im standing up above the road so i can see

theres one thing that i know
so where i lost my home
ive been wasting so much time
so i am standing up
and i am screaming out
if there is love inside
oh there is love

everybody likes what i need
im standing up above the road so i can see
everybody likes what i need
im standing up above the road so i can see

i am standing up above the roads
and finally i am free to breath

now finally able to breath
now finally able to see
im on the ropes---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
