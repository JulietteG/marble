So love me gently with a chainsaw
and take the glass against your wrist
You know i am your worst nightmare
Oh how you love my bloody kiss

But it's time to die
You're worth more dead

[Chorus]
Tell me your fantasies
I'll make you believe
That I really care
I'll look into your eyes
I'll tell you all my lies
As I take you slow

so love me gently with a chainsaw
I'll leave you like your father did
I'll bite your lip so fucking so hard
And watch the innocence just drip

Down your chest
And into my...mouth

[Chorus]
Tell me your fantasies
I'll make you believe
That I really care
I'll look into your eyes
I'll tell you all my lies
As I take you slow

So take your tears and go away

So take your tears and go away
A bitter ending from a slow decay

so take your tears and go away

And I'll sit here with a smile and a match

The lies she cried
The heart ache

The lies she cried
The heart ache

The lies she cried
The heart ache

The lies she cried
The heart ache---Lyrics submitted by saf.
