So let me take this medicine
To quench my love for violent things
My swan song will
Be like a bullet laced in anger
As the razor cuts a soft spot
On your heel

(Each breath) Is getting slower
(This war) Is getting harder 
To fight by myself
(Sick waves) Of bitter fashion
(Ripped down) The shield that I have
Tears rain from above

Do you see
The life I lead?

So follow me into the sun
And I will bleed the poisons dry

These bayonet scars never cease
To blind the light shed from the beast
And all we do is hate

(Eyes shot) From constant vision
(Angels) Are rendered useless
Good has lost it's heart

Do you see
The life I lead?

So follow me into the sun
And I will bleed the poisons dry

For you
For you 
(For you)
(For you)
(For you)

Bite to break skin
Don't give the secret
My stoic face
Beaten with passion
The phoenix will die
Inside the fire storm
I am the son
Follow my footsteps

Bite to break skin
Don't give the secret
My stoic face
Beaten with passion
The phoenix will die
Inside the fire storm
I am the son
So follow my footsteps---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
