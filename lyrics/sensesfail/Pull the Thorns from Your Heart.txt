I don't want to be afraid of this life anymore
I don't want to be suffocated by the weight
Who was that person I was pretending to be?
Silent compassion break these chains of misery
Scared to death of being vulnerable
So I did everything I could to put the walls up
I locked myself and held myself in a cell of shame
Screaming for a fucking change

Pull the thorns from your heart
Pull the thorns from your heart

I tried so hard to runaway from the truth
I fucking hated myself so I abused
My soul, my heart, my body
For the sexuality I didn't choose

Pull the thorns from your heart
Pull the thorns from your heart

Devastated by shame
I was so entrenched in pain
I found that hell
Is the absence to loving self

I've been looking for a pearl this whole time
It's been right in my chest
I went diving to the depths of hell once
But I only found death
And it said to me
"Don't be afraid of your end
Be bold, be authentic
Be brave enough to love again"
They said

Pull the thorns from your heart
To wander in the fields of flowers
Pull the thorns from your heart
To wander in the fields of flowers
Pull the thorns from your heart
To wander in the fields of flowers

Pull the thorns from your heart

Give up a little
Gain a little piece
Empty yourself
Become eternity
I will not die
I will not die in shame
I will not die
I will not die in shame---
