I was the Chapstick in your purse, to keep you smooth.
I was the finger in your throat, to keep you cute.
My liver hates you for walking out on us.
My kidneys drowning in a pool of a long lost love.

I stole your perfume to spray in my room,
You will always be here....

So Much 
For the past year!
I poured it down the drain with all the alcohol and pain I got from,
Your Eyes, 
Oh Your Eyes!
Im burning out my bedside,
And Im rotting out my insides slowly.

I was the hand that held your hair back from your face.
Now I must forget the way you taste

I stole your perfume to spray in my room,
You will always be here.

So Much 
For the past year!
I poured it down the drain with all the alcohol and pain I got from,
Your Eyes, 
Oh Your Eyes!
Im burning out my bedside,
And Im rotting out my insides slowly....

I love you so damn much; 
Ill even start to pray!
Ill put my faith in all your bullshit if it means youll stay.

I love you so damn much; 
Ill even start to pray!
Ill put my faith in all your bullshit if it means youll stay!

So Much 
For the past year!
I poured it down the drain with all the alcohol and pain I got from,
Your Eyes, 
Oh Your Eyes!
Im burning out my bedside,
And Im rotting out my insides,
Im burning out my bedside,
And Im rotting out my insides!

I love you so much, I started praying.
I love you so much that I started praying.

I love you so much, I started praying.
I love you so much that I started praying...---Lyrics submitted by Barbara.
