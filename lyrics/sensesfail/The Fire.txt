I'll light the fuse and I'll set that dam to blow flooding the entire town below
And all that I've known what wasn't nailed down will be washed away
My hands are shaking but I will not hesitate
I found the strength to face
The place I fear the most is the place I have to go to see the truth

It's ok to feel lost it just means you're alive
I've told myself a thousand times from the ashes we will rise
It's ok to feel lost walk through the flames and see
You're only left with that you need we're only here for the journey

Am I bold enough to be underlined like sand sifting through time
It all falls in line
Life is a mind field and on one side I'm stuck
I broke the key in the door I tried to unlock
I'm never giving up
The times that haunt you are the things you didn't do not what you did

It's ok to feel lost it just means you're alive
I've told myself a thousand times from the ashes we will rise
It's ok to feel lost walk through the flames and see
You're only left with what you need we're only here for the journey
We find the truth through tragedy

I'm finding new ways to make the same mistake
Putting my dreams on to paper and then folding them into planes
Then I left them go because when in Rome
I set fire to what I love the most

I just want to feel alive---Lyrics submitted by Cory.
