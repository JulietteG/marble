I can't believe it's been a year
Since I kissed my fears
On their salty lips
And said to them I love you all

I carried the weight of the world on my shoulders
For 20 years and look at me now

I've got something to say
About the last 12 months I've lived
I'm not the same kid I was when I was younger
I just thought you should know
I take a pill every day
to help me deal with life

And oh my God, I've lost control
I stare at accidents in a sick attempt
To feel at all

I carried the weight of the world on my shoulders
For 20 years and look at me now

I've got something to say
About the family that I've lost
I hope my mother and my father think
That they raised a healthy boy
Who needs the help of a shrink
To even leave the house?

And oh my God, I've lost control
I stare at accidents in a sick attempt
To feel at all

I'm not the same kid I was when I was younger
I just thought you
I just thought you should know

I'm not the same kid I was when I was younger
I just thought you
I just thought you should know

I carried the weight of the world on my shoulders
For 20 years and look at me now
And now
And now
I'm finding a way to forget everything that I know

I can't believe it's been a year
Since I kissed my fears
On their salty lips
And said to them I love you all

Don't ask, just follow
Repeat and swallow
Don't ask, just swallow them down your throat
Don't ask, just swallow
Repeat and follow
Don't ask, just swallow them down your throat

My best friend is a man, with a lab coat and a grin
I hold my shaking hand and he gives me medicine
It almost makes me feel at home
But they slowly steal my soul
I tell him I still feel alone
"Don't worry someday I promise you will feel whole"

And oh my God, I've lost control
Of the only thing in life
I had a hold of
And oh my God, I've lost control
Of the only thing in life
I had a hold of
And oh my God, I've lost control
Of the only thing in life
I had a hold of---Lyrics submitted by clive.
