i tried to be the one that everybody loved
Where has that gotten me?
I tear myself to shreds to prove that i'm someone
That I could never be

Now these unsightly marks define me

So help me, please someone come quick
I think I am losing it
Forgive me, I inherited this
From a stranger i'll never miss. . .
I'm sick.

My father taught me first hand how to be set free
Give up and runaway
I wish I could drain out his half of blood in me
But i'd still have his face

I curse reflections everyday

So help me, please someone come quick
I think I am losing it
Forgive me, I inherited this
From a stranger i'll never miss. . .

Here is my own family tradition
Following footsteps into addiction
So is there a way that i can find peace
While still numbing my pain
Is this my fate?
Cause your only son still cant seem to find his way

So help me, please someone come quick
I think I am losing it
Forgive me, I inherited this
From a stranger i'll never miss.

So father where the hell are you now?
I think that you would be proud
Your son who so unluckily
Fell right next to the tree

I hope you're proud of me,
I hope you're proud.---Lyrics submitted by Mike.
