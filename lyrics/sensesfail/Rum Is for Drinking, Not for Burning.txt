This captain goes down with the ship
All hands on deck, stand hip-to-hip
I shout the orders, "Shoot to kill!"
I'm dressed to thrill,
I'm dressed to thrill.

And all my enemies,
I want their eyes to see,
Their captain walk the plank
Destroy them, rank by rank.

Sail with me into the setting sun
The battle has been won, but war has just begun
And as we grow, emotion starts to die,
We need to find a way, just to keep our desire alive.

Now set the sail to quarter mast,
We'll jump the ship, we'll sink 'em fast.
Men follow me to victory,
Red as the sea,
Red as the sea.

And to the cannons roar,
Their bodies dance ashore,
A pirate's life for me,
I won't go quietly.

Sail with me into the setting sun
The battle has been won, but war has just begun
And as we grow, emotion starts to die,
We need to find a way, just to keep our desire alive.

And to my damsel in distress,
You've made a mess of your new dress [x2]
You've made a mess!

Sail with me into the setting sun
The battle has been won, but war has just begun
And as we grow, emotion starts to die,
We need to find a way, just to keep our desire alive (I'm dressed to thrill)
(I'm dressed to thrill)
Just to keep our desire alive (I'm dressed to thrill)
(I'm dressed to thrill)---Lyrics submitted by Cory.
