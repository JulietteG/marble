Be the lamp unto yourself
Shine the light onto the truth

There's so much beauty in this world I just didn't see it
I'm too busy protecting heart with good reason
Some of us have been so abused, so mislead, so far from love
We don't even know how far we've gone

Why did I stay in prison when the door was left wide open?
What was it that I was clinging to?
I changed the perspective, not just the view

Love has changed me
Love has changed me

What are the stories you tell yourself
That you arent good enough or shouldnt feel?
The love that you deserve is pounding in your chest
Reach inside and fucking grab it

Be the lamp unto yourself
Shine the light onto the truth

There's so much beauty, there's so much love
If you're willing to give up
There's so much beauty, there's so much love
If you're willing to give up

Be the lamp unto yourself
Shine the light onto the truth---
