Calling all cars we've got another victim,
'Cause my love has become an affliction,
What did you expect from me? What did you expect from me?

I'm sorry but I* THINK I failed to mention
That I lied at my very first confession
What did you expect from me? Well What did you expect from me?

'Cause this has been building since I have been breathing,
And I know how it's going to end.

So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word when I swore that I would let you down.
(And now that I'm gone) Try to forget me and just move on.
So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word and you hate me for it now,
(But you knew all along) Try to forget me and just move on.

Oh my dear what have I gone and done now?
It's curtain call, I'm about to take my last bow.
What did you expect from me? Well what did you expect from me?

Without giving away the entire ending,
I ruined the evening again.

So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word when I swore that I would let you down.
(And now that I'm gone) Try to forget me and just move on.
So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word and you hate me for it now,
(But you knew all along) Try to forget me and just move on.

I don't, have love left inside, inside.
And I don't, have love left inside, inside.

Are you desperate for an answer?
I don't have an ounce of good left in me now,
Thats why I walked out.

So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word when I swore that I would let you down.
(And now that I'm gone) Try to forget me and just move on.
So will you scatter my ashes where they won't be found?
I kept my word and you hate me for it now,
(You hate me for it now) Try to forget me and just move on.

I am not the one that you should blame,
So take what I left you for the pain.
I am not the one that you should blame,
So take what I left you for the pain.
And do your best to forget my name.---Lyrics submitted by Will.
