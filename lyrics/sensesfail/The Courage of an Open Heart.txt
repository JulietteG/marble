Sometimes I get so silent
I can hear my heartbeat
Sometimes I get so silent
The memories come back to me

But now I know, there is suffering no one should have to feel
Hiding the truth, because it wasnt safe to be
Open with who I was, it left me in agony
The shame, the sadness, the darkness surrounded every part of my being

I had no compassion, no love for myself
There was no relief, except in thoughts of death
Except in thoughts of death

I have learned to love myself, I have learned to care
I have learned to make peace with the sadness and despair

I had no compassion, no love for myself, there was no relief
Except in thoughts of death

I was so alone, buried in sadness, love dragged me out of it
So alone, buried in sadness, love dragged me out of it
I want to love with the courage of an open heart
I want to love with the courage of an open heart

I want to love with the courage of an open heart
I want to love with the courage of an open heart---
