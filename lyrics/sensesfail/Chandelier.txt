This head is haunted by a chorus in the sky.
The voices arent mine,
I kiss the darkness as I see the whites of their eyes.
Theyre crawling up my spine.
They bloom at midnight in the middle of the moonlight.

Strike a match!
Light the chandelier!
This bedroom is a ballroom now.
Strike the band and make the dead dance.
This room is filled with corpses in costumes.

My guest dress in black and blue, I raise a toast to the few.
The orchids are in bloom.
Theres a dead not in the choir of the garden.
The sun will kiss the gloom because the wardens giving pardons soon.

Strike a match!
Light the chandelier!
This bedroom is a ballroom now.
Strike the band and make the dead dance.
This room is filled with corpses in costumes.

this is your last night. Do you believe in what you write?
We open the sky and we hope you see light.

Strike a match!
Light the chandelier!
This bedroom is a ballroomnow.
Strike the band and make the dead dance.
This room is filled with corpses in costumes.

Strike a match
I kiss the darkness as I see the whites of their eyes
Strike a match
This room is filled with corpses in costumes.---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
