Life, is floating fast away.
But I look, your head is turned away.

From the moment you left I knew that something wasn't right.
But the feeling inside has kept me up all night.

You and me are like one heart-beat.
You and me are like one heart-beat.

So slice open my veins.
And let, the romance bleed away.

From the moment you left I knew that something wasn't right.
But the feeling inside has kept me up all night.

You and me are like one heart-beat.
You and me are like one heart-beat.

Back into what I thought I knew, these words inside me, tell me what to do.
My heart held, in the palm of your hand.
(Forget my name) Now I know, the way to go, this place inside my demented mind.
(Forget my name) You saw me bleeding on the bathroom floor.
(Forget my name) This time in silence, this time I win. [x3]
(Forget my name) Now you will feel my pain
Forget my name [x5]---Lyrics submitted by felicia.
