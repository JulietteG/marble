Rest in peace, girl. Your death was shame.
The paper said a bullet got in your way.
But I smell foul play, possible poisoning.
I had to bring you in for questioning.
I went to your grave, dug up your body,
Brought it to my house where you lay

So lets play doctor, babe
Well operate today.
Incisions must be made,
You could help solve this case
For me

Im heading downtown
To show what I had found.
Its not a suicide, its a crime.
I have a witness, its clearly evident
There had to be someone else present
At the time of death poisons in stomach
How could she pull it if shes dead.

So lets play doctor, babe
Well operate today.
Incisions must be made,
You could help solve this case.
We need a scalpel now
Under white lights you lay
Weve got to hurry up 
Before the flesh decays
Away
Away

I catch the murderer and send him away
Ill get the evidence from your last day

 So lets play doctor, babe
Well operate today.
Incisions must be made,
You could help solve this case.
We need a scalpel now
Under white lights you lay
Weve got to hurry up 
Before the flesh decays
Away
Away---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
