It's My pussy i can do what i want
hmph I'm a big girl now
It's My pussy i can do what i want
hmph I'm a big girl now

Front back side to side
Pussy pop do it right
Front back side to side
Pussy pop do it right

Shake it, shake that wrapping candy
Wrapper on your booty, girl you lookin' dandy
Now pop that couchie

Damn girl you's a freak
Give it to me, she's a beast
Get her wet, watch her leak
Runin game but I dont speak

Shake it fast, west to east
Nasty talk, we in the sheets
She's a big girl, yea i know
Get her when she curl her toes

Get it girl, What you want?
Said you like it from the front
Don't be scared, pussy pop
From the back and I wont stop

Sit on top, she like to ride
Go ahead clap thighs
Like tit when she make it dip
Throw it back, it's in the hips

Front back side to side
Pussy pop do it right
Front back side to side
Pussy pop do it right

Shake it, shake that wrapping candy
Wrapper on your booty, girl you lookin' dandy
Now pop that pussy

Have you ever heard big girls need love?
Its her pussy she can do what she want
Pop it, drop it, shake it, clap it
Never go broke when the pussy start mackin'
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets
Pop it like Orville, damn thats nice
In the Porsche second, and damn that dice
Took her home, and she rode it like a bike
Take clothes off, yeah can he turn a rapper
Meet me all the way, and men go wrap her
From the club to the house, bed to the floor
Up all night, yeah I go
Shakin dreads, banging turts
Niggas goin hella dumb
Pussy wet, ass fat
Im a dog chasin cat

[fade out]
Front back side to side
Pussy pop do it right
Front back side to side
Pussy pop do it right

Shake it, shake that wrapping candy
Wrapper on your booty, 
girl you lookin' dandy
Now pop that couchie---Lyrics submitted by Jalissa.
