Do you see me
Do you care
You talk about me
Like I'm not there

Don't get a word in
When you're around
I bet you don't know
What I'm about

Cause I will, I will
Speak for myself
What you see
Isn't all I am
I need a place to stand
I will, I will speak for myself
There's so much you're missing
If you cared you'd listen

You suffocate me
You drown me out
I'm tired of waiting
Without a doubt

I feel I'm fading
I flicker out
My heart is screaming
Without a sound

Cos I will, I will
Speak for myself
What you see
Isn't all I am
I need a place to stand
I will, I will speak for myself
There's so much you're missing
If you cared you'd listen

I'm not sorry for who I am
Take it or leave it
It's my time to take a stand
Throw it or keep it
Know that I don't need to understand
Won't say it again

(I will)
(I will)
(I will)
(I will)
You know I will

Cos I will, I will
Speak for myself
What you see
Isn't all I am
I need a place to stand
I will, you know I will
I will speak for myself
There's so much you're missing
If you cared you'd listen
If you cared you'd listen

I will, I will
Speak for myself---Lyrics submitted by Patricia.
