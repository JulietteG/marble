I am moving through the crowd
Trying to find myself
Feel like a guitar thats never played
Will someone strum away

[chorus]
And I ask myself
Who do I wanna be
Do I wanna throw away the key
And invent a whole new me
And I tell myself 
No one,no one
Don't wanna be
No one,but me

You are moving though the crowd
Trying to find yourself
Feeling like a doll left on the shelf
Will someone take you down

[chorus]
And you ask yourself 
Who do I wanna be
Do I wanna throw away the key 
And invent a whole new me
Gotta tell yourself 
No one,no one
Don't wanna be
No one,but me

Your life plays out on the shadows of the wall
You turn the light on to erase it all
You wonder what its like to not feel worthless
So open all the blinds and all the curtains

No one,no one
Don't wanna be
No one,but me

We are moving through the crowd---Lyrics submitted by Esther.
