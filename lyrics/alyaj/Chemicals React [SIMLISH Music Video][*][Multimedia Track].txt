You make me feel
Out of my element
Like I'm walking on broken glass
Like my world's spinning
In slow motion
And I'm moving to fast

Were you right was I wrong
Were you weak was I strong yeah
Both of us broken
Caught in the moment
We lived and we loved
And we hurt and we joked yeah
But the planets all aligned
When you looked into my eyes
And just like that
The Chemicals React
The Chemicals React

You make me feel
Out of my element
Like I'm drifting out to the sea
Like the tide's pulling me in deeper
Making it harder to breath

We cannot deny
How we feel inside
We cannot deny

Were you right, was I wrong 
Were you weak, was I strong, yeah 
Both of us broken 
Caught in the moment 
We lived and we loved 
And we hurt and we joked, yeah 
But the planets all aligned 
When you looked into my eyes 
And just like that 
The chemicals react 
The chemicals react 

Kaleidoscope of colors 
Turning hopes on fire, sun is burning 
Shining down on both of us 
Don't let us lose it (don't let us lose it) 

Were you right, was I wrong 
Were you weak, was I strong, yeah 
Both of us broken 
Caught in the moment 
We lived and we loved 
And we hurt and we joked, yeah 

We lived 
We loved 
We hurt 
We joked 
We're right 
We're wrong 
We're weak 
We're strong 
We lived to love 

But the planets all aligned 
When you looked into my eyes 
And just like that 
Watch the chemicals react 
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
And just like that 
The chemicals react 
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
