You your always there for me 
When I need you most
Day and night
Your by my side 
Protecting me

When I feel like crashing down
You seem to be around 
There you are
Your not that far
Cause

Whenever, Wherever, baby
You'll protect me
no matter what
hold me tight
With all your might
You'll never let me go
Protecting me
Protecting me

You, you listen to me when
I speak out loud and you
You know right when my heart's been bent

When my life's been tumbling 'round
You take me off the ground
You tell me everything;'s okay

Whenever, Wherever, baby
You'll protect me 
No matter what
Hold me tight
With all your might
You'll never let me go 
You'll never let me go

When its my turn (My turn)
To help you out ( help you out)
I gladly lift you up without a doubt (Let me go)

Whenever, Wherever, baby
You'll protect me 
No matter what
Hold me tight
With all your might
You'll never let me go

Whenever, Wherever, baby 
You'll protect me
No matter what
Hold me tight
With all your might
You'll never let me go

You, Your always there for me
When I need you most 
Day and night
Ur by my side
Protecting me---Lyrics submitted by alex.
