You were the one
That I couldn't find
Hidden away
In the depths of my mind

Why did I let you go
You're to good to be true
I messed it up and now I don't know what to do
We ran in circles and wasted time
From right to wrong
From right to wrong

If I knew that you were mine
I wouldn't have wasted time
I wish I could erase the past
Now its all collapsed
In my lap

I over thought
So I locked up my heart yeah
There you stood
Your blue eyes hidden beneath your hood

Why did I let you go
You're to good to be true
I messed it up and now I don't know what to do
We ran in circles and wasted time
From right to wrong
From right to wrong

If I knew that you were mine
I wouldn't have wasted time
I wish I could erase the past
Now its all collapsed
In my lap

My mind is blank just like a clean slate
Will I meet another guy with the same blue eyes
And the same name, with the converse shoes I gave.
Will he have the same laugh
Wear my homemade hat.
Bet I'll make another mistake.
And think he's just another fake.

Wish I could erase the past now
Wish I could bring you back

If I knew that you were mine
I wouldn't have wasted time
I wish I could erase the past
Now its all collapsed
In my lap

If I knew that you were mine
I wouldn't have wasted time
I wish I could erase the past
Now its all collapsed
In my lap---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
