You say you don't know me
You say you don't owe me
You say that you won't be happy waiting
You think that you're worth it
You think you deserve it
You want it all right now, your way

Together we're one
(there is no finish line)
Together we're one
(why don't you realize)
Together we're one
(I know that everything's gonna be fine, together)
Together we're one

One in a million
Don't be afraid
Don't say
It can't play out the way we want
It's gonna be brilliant
Like it or leave it I can't help but feel like
I'm one, one in a million
I'm worth all the crap that I'm putting you through
I'll be blunt, the honest truth is
Like it or love it or LEAVE IT
You decide, you decide
Don't waste my time

Sit back and unwind now
It's gonna be fine now
You can't justify your impatience

Together we're one
(there is no finish line)
Together we're one
(why don't you realize)
Together we're one
(I know that everything's gonna be fine, together)
Together we're one

One in a million
Don't be afraid
Don't say
It can't play out the way we want
It's gonna be brilliant
Like it or leave it I can't help but feel like
I'm one, one in a million
I'm worth all the crap that I'm putting you through
I'll be blunt, the honest truth is
Like it or love it or.. LEAVE IT

What was that line in that one movie?
When he looked at her like it would last forever
Said it to her face that he'd do whatever it took
To be her love but above all what he wanted most
Credits roll. Curtains close.
Then you whispered in my ear
Together we're one in a million (Don't be afraid)
Together we're one in a million (Don't be afraid)

Together we're one

One in a million
Don't be afraid
Don't say
It can't play out the way we want
It's gonna be brilliant
Like it or leave it I can't help but feel like
I'm one, one in a million
I'm worth all the crap that I'm putting you through
I'll be blunt, the honest truth is
Like it or love it or LEAVE IT

You decide, you decide
Don't waste my time
You decide, you decide
Leave it---Lyrics submitted by paige.
