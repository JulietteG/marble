I get in the car
Another tragic disaster
But I'm safe where I am
Yet another is captured
The traffic is stopped
People just stare
Another alert does the kid have a prayer?
Life is not fair

Its hard to look outside my door
With all the news reports and more
Yet I will do my part and stay on alert
For all the kids out there who are getting hurt
It could have happened to me
Can you make me believe
This could have a happy end
'Cause I am one of them

I try to grow up
But I am chased by my fears
It could happen to me
And I worry in tears
Reports of the girl
Makin' me scared
Led off to die and why was I spared?
Life is not fair!

It's hard to look outside my door
With all the news reports and more
yet I will do my part and stay on alert
For all the kids out there who are getting hurt
It could have happened to me
Can you make me believe
This could have a happy end
'cause I am one of them

I am one of them
Am one of them
I am one of them
Am one of them
I am one of them
Am one of them
I wish I could bring back all of them---Lyrics submitted by Jemma.
