Please stop calling on my cell
I've got enough voice mails
Don't you get the picture?
I don't return your e-mails, IM or your text
Messages are getting boring fast
I try to be careful with my words

You're all over me, suffocating
I need to breathe, doorbell's ringing
CD you sent, won't stop singing
How's that for being careful with words
careful, careful

No more flowers at my door
I've started to ignore
The smell of moldy petals
I must confess you're desperate
To get my attention
Shoppers we are closing please go home
I try to be careful with my words

You're all over me, suffocating
I need to breathe, doorbell is ringing
CD you sent, won't stop singing
How's that for being careful with words

First I was flattered by
All the attention
I wanted to see where this would go
Then you got weird on me
Obsessed in the third degree
'til I was ready to explode

None of these words have been rehearsed
I don't think they can be reversed
Sadly it's only one-sided
Only a matter of time before I have to confess what's on my mind
I told you would, didn't I

You're all over me, suffocating
I need to breathe, doorbell is ringing
CD you sent, won't stop singing
How's that for being careful with words

You're all over me, suffocating
I need to breathe, doorbell is ringing
CD you sent, won't stop singing
I was so careful I ran out of words ---
