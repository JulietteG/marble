Please, don't flatter yourself
You're not the only one 
This heart has ever felt
Please, don't exaggerate
Don't tell me you're okay, okay, okay..

I will admit, if you admit it
It's harder than we both thought
It's easier to fall apart
Look where we are (look where we are, look where we are)
I can forgive it, I can't forget it
You left me here with all these scars
and you can't deny the hardest part
I'm not in your arms

We're more hurt than we appear
The world will never know
We both have tasted tears, my dear
You're denying what I say
Don't act like it's okay
Cuz it's not okay

I will admit, if you admit it
It's harder than we both thought
It's easier to fall apart
Look where we are (look where we are, look where we are)
I can forgive it, I can't forget it
You left me here with all these scars
and you can't deny the hardest part
I'm not in your arms

It's not in the cards
It's not in the stars!
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry
You're not sorry

I will admit, if you admit it

Just please, don't flatter yourself
Please, don't flatter yourself---Lyrics submitted by .
