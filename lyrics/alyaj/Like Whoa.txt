[Aj:]
Life is good I can't complain
I mean I could but no one's listening
Your image overwhelms my brain
And it feels good, good, good

[Aly:]
Now I'm rolling my window down
I love the wind but I hate the sound
You're like a tattoo that I can't remove
And it feels good, it feels good, it feels good

[Chorus:]
Like a rollercoaster ride
Holding on white knuckles like
whoa, whoa
Can't believe I'm like
whoa, whoa
Everytime I'm like
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like
whoa, whoa
Got me feeling like
whoa, whoa
Everytime I'm like

[Aj:] In the morning it begins again
[Aly:}Feels like I'm falling better strap me in
[Aj:]I think I'm running out of oxygen
[Aly & Aj:]And it feels good, it feels good, it feels good

[Chorus:]
Like a rollercoaster ride
Holding on white knuckles like
whoa, whoa
Can't believe I'm like
whoa, whoa
Everytime I'm like
Up and down and side to side
Every inch of me is like
whoa, whoa
Got me feeling like
whoa, whoa
Everytime I'm like

My inhibitions are beginning to let go
This situation
I can't help but lose control
You're an affliction that I cannot seem to break
It feels good, it feels good
I'm holding on, holdin' holdin',
holdin' holdin', holdin' holdin',
holdin' holdin', I'm hoing on

[Chorus]
Like a roller coaster ride
Like I'm running a red light
Like a rocket ship in flight
There's nothin' else that makes me feel like WHOA!

Like a rollercoaster whoa
Holding on my knuckles whoa
want me to let u off whoa
Every inch of me is like
whoa, whoa
Got me feeling like
whoa, whoa---Lyrics submitted by Sherlynn.
