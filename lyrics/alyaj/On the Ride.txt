We don't have to try
To think the same thoughts
We just have a way
Of knowing everything is going to be okay

We laugh till we cry
Read each other's mind
Live with a smile
Make it all worth while
Make it all worth while

Life has moments hard to describe 
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this
Mountain we're on
Always knowing we're gunna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this
Mountain we're on

The view is so clear
It's crazy up here
Life is amazing with you on the ride

We dont want to sleep
Just want to stay up
There's so much to stay
Not enough hours in the day

We laugh till we cry
Read each other's minds
Live with a smile
Make it all worth while
Make it all worth while

Life has moments hard to describe
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this
Mountain we're on
Always knowing we're gunna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this
Mountain we're on

The view is so clear
And It's crazy up here 
Life is amazing with you on the ride

We're trying to be lazy
The journey is perfect
The place is so crazy
The race is so worth it
I will be with you 
We'll do this together
Always together

Life has moments hard to describe
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this 
Moutain we're on
Always knowing we're gunna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive
Never coming down from this
Never coming down never coming down  
Never coming down

Always knowing we're gunna be fine
Feeling great and feeling alive 
Never coming down from this
Moutain we're on

The view is so clear 
And it's crazy up here
Life is amazing with you on the ride

This place is so crazy 
The race is so worth it
Life is amazing with you on the ride---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
