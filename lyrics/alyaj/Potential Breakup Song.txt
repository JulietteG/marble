It took too long
It took too long
It took to long for you to call back
And normally I would just forget that
Except for the fact it was my birthday
My stupid birthday

I played along
I played along
I played along
rolled right off my back
But obviously my armor was cracked
What kind of a boyfriend would forget that?
Who would forget that?

The type of guy who doesnt see
What he has until she leaves
Dont let me go
Cause without me, you know youre lost
Wise up now or pay the cost
Soon you will know

Youre not livin till youre livin
Livin with me
Youre not winnin till youre winnin
Winnin me
Youre not gettin till youre gettin
Gettin to me
Youre not livin till youre livin
living for me

This is the potential breakup song
Our ...album needs just 1
Oh baby please
Please tell me

We got along
We got along
We got along until you did that!
Now all I want is just my stuff back
Do you get that?
Let me repeat that....
I want my stuff back

You can send it in a box
I dont care just drop it off
I wont be home...
Cause without me, you know youre lost(lost)
Minus you Im better off
Soon you will know

Youre not livin till youre livin
Livin with me
Youre not winnin till youre winnin
Winnin me
Youre not gettin till youre gettin
Gettin to me
Youre not livin till youre livin
living for me

You can try, you can try
You know I know itd be a lie
Without me youre gonna die
So you better think clearly, clearly
Before you nearly, nearly
Mess up the situation that your gonna miss dearly, dearly
Cmon

Youre not livin till youre livin
Livin with me
Youre not winnin till youre winnin
Winnin me
Youre not gettin till youre gettin
Gettin to me
Youre not livin till youre livin
living for me

This is the potential breakup song
Our album needs just one
Oh baby please
Please tell me

This is the potential make-up song
please just admit youre wrong
Which will it be?
Which will it be?---Lyrics submitted by Katherine.
