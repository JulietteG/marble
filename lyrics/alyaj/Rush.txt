Into your head, into your mind
Out of your soul, race through your veins
You can't escape, you can't escape

Into your life, into your dreams
Out of the dark, sunlight again
You can't explain, you can't explain

Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Rushing through your hair
Rushing through your head
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now, you don't have to know how
Know it all before you try 

Pulling you in, spinning you round
Lifting your feet right off the ground
You can't believe it's happening now 

Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Rushing through your hair
Rushing through your head
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now, you don't have to know how
Know it all before you try 

It takes you to another place
Imagine everything you can
All the colors start to blend
Your system overloads again 

(Can you feel it?)

Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now, you don't have to know how
Know it all before you try 

Don't let nobody tell you 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't let nobody tell you 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Give into the rush now, you don't have to know how
Know it all before you try 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
