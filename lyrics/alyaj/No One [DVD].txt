I am moving through the crowd
Trying to find myself
Feel like a guitar thats never played
will someone strum away

And i ask myself
who do i wanna be
do i wanna throw in a key
and invent
a whole new me 


chorus-
Gotta tell my self
no one no one
don't wanna be
no one but meeeee


you are moving through the crowd
trying to find yourself
feel like a doll left on a shelf
will someone take ya down

and you ask yourself
who do i wanna be
Do i wanna throw in a key
and invent
a whole new me

chorus-

Your life hangs out on the shadows of the wall
turn the lights off to erase it all
I wonder how it feels to not feel worthless
SOturn down the blinds
and pull down the curtains

no one no one
don't wanna be any one but me



we are moving through the crowd
trying to find ourselves---Lyrics submitted by madz.
