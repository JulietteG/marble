(Verse)
In your mind then you realize youre on your own
I know the feelings inside you start to grow

(Pre-Chorus)
Please tell me that its alright, alright, alright
I wanna know
Please tell me that its alright, alright, alright
I wanna know
Please tell me, tell me

(Chorus x2)
Cause everybodys got something
Something they cant hide
Let it out into the open
Right here, right now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

(Verse)
When you turn up the light and youre all alone
Cold as the shapes and the shadows gone

(Pre-Chorus)
Please tell me that its alright, alright, alright
Tell me that its alright, alright, alright
I wanna know
Please tell me, tell me

(Chorus x2)
Cause everybodys got something
Something they cant hide
Let it out into the open
Right here, right now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
(Everybody clap your hands now)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
(Everybody clap your hands oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh

(Chorus x2)
Cause everybodys got something
Something they cant hide
Let it out into the open
Right here, right now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
(Everybody clap your hands now)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
(Everybody clap your hands oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh
