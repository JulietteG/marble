(feat. Emeli Sand) 

I dont do yoga, never tried Pilates 
Not many people want me at their parties 
Tryna find my place, some place, oh I, oh I, oh I 
I drink a little more than recommended 
This world aint exactly what my heart expected 
Tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I 

See, whoa, cest la vie 
Maybe somethings wrong with me 
But, whoa, at least I am free, I am free 
Yeah, whoa, cest la vie 
Maybe somethings wrong with me 
But, hey, at least I am free, I am free 

If you ask the church then I am no believer 
Spend Sundays asleep I'm just another dreamer 
Still tryna find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I 
I guess I aint too good for money neither 
I got two left feet, no, I'm no Jackson either 
Just tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I 

See, whoa, cest la vie 
Maybe somethings wrong with me 
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free 
Yeah, whoa, cest la vie 
Maybe somethings wrong with me 
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free 

Just tryna find my home sweet home, sweet home, sweet home, sweet home, 
I drink a little more than recommended 
This aint exactly what my heart expected 

Whoa, cest la vie 
Maybe somethings wrong with me 
But whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free 
Yeah, whoa, cest la vie 
Maybe somethings wrong with me 
But, whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free. 

Whoa, cest la vie 
Maybe somethings wrong with me 
Whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free 
Whoa, cest la vie 
Maybe somethings wrong with me 
Whoa, at least I am free, oh, oh, I am free. ---
