(feat. Becky Hill)

[Verse:]
Bury my ghost
Start my glory days
Infiltrate my heart
And take the pain away
Took me time
To see through your eyes
Oh Im not scared
My words are no lies

[Pre-Chorus:]
Powerless for your love, your love
Powerless for your love, your love

[Chorus:]
I need to be strong
But you have made me weak
I wont do you wrong
Cause these feelings run deep
Where do we belong?
I know wed search to find
Cause Im powerless for your love
I think Im losing my mind

[Verse:]
And after it all
Would you still stand up and fight?
When you're hidden in darkness
Would you run towards the light?
Even though Im alone
I can feel you here with me
I try to block you out
But youre all I see

[Pre-Chorus:]
Powerless for your love, your love
Powerless for your love, your love

[Chorus:]
I need to be strong
But you have made me weak
I wont do you wrong
Cause these feelings run deep
Where do we belong?
I know wed search to find
Cause Im powerless for your love
I think Im losing my mind

Powerless, powerless
I think Im losing my mind
Powerless, powerless

[Bridge:]
Tell me this time
You wont let me go
With you my by side
I dont feel alone
I've let go of my pride
Now I can call you my own

[Chorus:]
I need to be strong
But you have made me weak
I wont do you wrong
Cause these feelings run deep
Where do we belong?
I know wed search to find
Im powerless for your love
I think Im losing my mind---
