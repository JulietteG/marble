Lost my heart 
And lost my soul 
Now it's time 
Baby, oh no 

Lost my mind 
And lost my goal 

Oh, not giving in 
I'm not giving in 
Not giving in 
Woh, I'm not giving in 

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 

This time,I'm gonna be stronger 
I'm not giving in 

Waste my time... 
Lost, and now my love is cursed 
Time to make these things feel right 
Oh, let's start this show 
Let's shine this time 

Oh, I'm not giving in 
Not giving in 
Not giving in 
Not this time 
Not gonna give in 

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 

This time, I'm gonna be stronger 
I'm not giving in 

Nooo 
Not giving in 
Not giving in 
I'm gonna be stronger 
I'm gonna be stronger 

(This time 
I'm gonna be stronger 
I'm not giving in)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
