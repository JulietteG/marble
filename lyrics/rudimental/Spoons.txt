This is when I loose my balance
This is when I loose all control
This is when I find the challenge
The challenge I can call my own
It's hard to fight a battle
When all my weapons are so far
Out of reach and balance
And I forget who you are
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa

This is where I find my balance
This is (the) way I gain all control
Now that I can leave my challenge
The challenge I don't need no more
It's hard to fight a battle
When I've been stretched out way too far
Out of reach and balance
Now I regret who you are
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
Deeper, deeper
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper, deeper.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
