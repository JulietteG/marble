You know I say its true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel ah ah
I can feel ah ah

You know I say its true

Can you feel it too
I can feel ah ah
I can feel ah ah ya

You know I say its true
I can feel the love
Can you feel it too
I can feel ah ah
I can feel ah ah

You know I say its true
You know I say (say) (say) (say)

You know I say its true

You know I say its true

Can you feel it too
I can feel ah ah

You know I say its true
