From one moment to a next
Reading in the papers to know what's best
Sometimes you don't know yourself
Eating loads of vitamins for your health
From one moment to a next
Red negativity in the street
Maybe it's the dirt, maybe it's the heat
A baby on a bus smiled at me so easy

Now I think it's alright we're together
Now I think that's a riot
Now I think it's the best we've ever played it
Now I think that's a riot
Now I think it's alright to feel inhuman
Now I think that's a riot
Now I think it's alright we'll sing together
Now I think that's a riot

A running child's bloody with burning knees
A careless child's money flew in the trees
A camping child's happy with winter's freeze
A lucky child don't know how lucky she is

From one moment to a next
A thousand wasted Brooklyners are depressed
The ins and outs of supper's chest
He'll only be your friend if he touches your breasts
From one moment to a next
A shifting in the plates of what you ingest
From sugared teas to honeyed pests
Bulimic vegetarian wins weight contest

Now I thinks it's alright we're together
Now I think that's a riot
Now I think it's the best we've ever played it
Now I think that's a riot
Now I think it's alright to feel inhuman
Now I think that's a riot
Now I think it's alright we'll sing together
Now I think that's a riot

A running child's bloody with burning knees
A careless child's money flew in the trees
A camping child's happy with winter's freeze
A lucky child don't know how lucky he is
