Takes some time to waste a guy 
Must be mad 
OK, a smoldering burn 
Must be bad 
Cut deep and festering day by day 

No one wants a free for all 
Just a chance 
A break, a lift to climb 
On a back 
Tough luck a pebble short of quit 

Only those that get into the way 

Way way back before the thumb 
Was a way 
A path, a reckoning 
Like a catch 
Sewn deep and gesturing day by day 

Take a guy, an every man 
Must be glad 
Well off, a gentle ease 
Underneath 
A film thats cracking bit by bit 

Only those that get into the way 
Thats that 
Or maybe keep in mind 
Take the hit or take the fall 
Fall back---
