There isn't much there if I'd need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
With a little girl and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

There isn't much there if I'd need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
With a little girl and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

There isn't much there if I'd need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
With a little girl and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

There isn't much there if I'd need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
With a little girl and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the vicious race
But to provide for one who asks
I will with heart on my father's grave

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the vicious race
But to provide for one who asks
I will with heart on my father's grave

On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like our social stats
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like our social stats
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls

There isn't much there if I'd need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
With a little girl and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the vicious race
But to provide for one who asks
I will with heart on my father's grave

On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave
On my father's grave, on my father's grave

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like our social stats
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like our social stats
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like our social stats
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things
Like our social stats
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls---Lyrics submitted by Hannah Boudreau.
