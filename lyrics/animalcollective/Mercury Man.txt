Sounds like machines talking to me on the phone
I say but they don't quite get me
It's hard to make my feelings known
Sometimes I wish for a long wave
When I'm waiting for someone to calm my tone
Bad vibes I've got hold dementia
When I'm one thousand hertz from home
Sometimes I wish for a short wave home

Two human beings
I'm upset you're upset
What's to be done?

Old lines
Everybody talking from their homes
Bad news but your bed will take you
If you could only feel what's wrong
Sometimes I wish for a hand wave home.

Two human beings
I'm upset you're upset
What's to be done?
Two human beings
What a mess what a mess
What's to be done?

You got to slide it off like mercury
Can I play my parts like mercury?
Would you let me feel like mercury?
Can I always be like mercury?

We must be somewhere
Can't find it (nowhere love)
Is it me?
I keep calling
It feels like there's no one there---
