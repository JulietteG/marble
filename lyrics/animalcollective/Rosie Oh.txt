As I walked across the bridge
With a backpack cross my shoulder blades
The Everglades below the wooden cracks

You had offered up a ride
So I might not get accosted by
The watery slide

But I said no Id rather not
Said no, Id rather not
Said no, Id rather not step in

As I left my home I cried
And a substituted figure tried
To reconcile the things I'd left behind

You had opened up the doors
And made a place where I could sit inside
And fortify

But I said no Id rather not
Said no, Id rather not
Said no, Id rather not step in

I'm on my own,
I'm on my own,
I'm on my own,
I'm on my own

Now no ones been invested in
How no one knows what's best for him

I'm on my own,
I'm on my own,
I'm on my own,
I'm on my own

When no ones left to light the load
Then so one goes to lift alone

I'd like to embrace it,
Like to embrace it,
Like to embrace it all

I'd like to embrace it,
Like to embrace it,
Like to embrace it all

Have I made this or is it
That I've been made?---
