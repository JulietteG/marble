The Nurse Who Loved Me

Say hello,
to the rugs topography,
it holds quite alot of interest, 
with your face down on it...
Say hello,
to the shrinking in your head,
you can't see it, but you know it's there,
so don't neglect it...

I'm taking her home with me,
all dressed in white,
she's got everything I need,
Pharmacy keys,
she's falling hard for me,
I can see it in her eyes,
she acts just like a nurse...
With all the other guys.

Say hello,
to all the apples on the ground,
they were once in your eyes,
but you sneezed them out while sleeping...
Say hello,
to everything you've left behind,
it's even more apart of your life now that, 
you can't touch it...

I'm taking her home with me, 
all dressed in white,
she's got everything I need,
some pills in a little cup,
she's falling hard for me,
I can see it in her eyes,
she acts just like a nurse...
With all the other guys.

She's got everything I need,
Pharmacy keys,
she acts just like a nurse...
With all the other guys.

Say hello,
to the rugs topography...---Lyrics submitted by joel.
