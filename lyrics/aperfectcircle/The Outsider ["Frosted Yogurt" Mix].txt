Help me if you can
It's just that this
Is not the way I'm wired
So could you please
Help me understand why
You're given in to all these 
Wreckless dark desires you're

Talking to yourself again
Suicidal imbecile 
Think about it
you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get through to you precious
Knowing this
Why you wanna throw it away like this
Such a mess
why would I wanna watch you 

Dis-con-nect and self district 
one bullet at a time
What's your rush now 
everyone will have his day to die

Medicated drama queen
Picture perfect numb beligerance 
Narcissistic drama queen
Craving fame and all its decadence

Lying through your teeth again
Suicidal imbecile 
think about it 
you're pounding on a fault line 
what'll it take to get through to you precious
Knowing this 
why you wanna throw it away like this
such a mess
why would I wanna watch you
Dis-con-nect and self distruct one bullet at a time
What's your rush now 
everyone will have his day to die

They were right about you...
They were right about you...

Lying to my face again
Suicidal imbecile 
Think about it 
you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get through to you precious
Knowing this
Why you wanna throw it away like this
Such a mess, over this, over this!

Dis-con-nect and self distruct one bullet at a time
What's your hurry everyone will have his day to die
If you choose to pull the trigger
Should your drama prove sincere 
Do it somewhere far away from here!---Lyrics submitted by Emma Paul.
