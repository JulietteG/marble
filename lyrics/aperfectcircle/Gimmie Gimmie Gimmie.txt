Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie,
I need some more,I need some more,
Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie
Don't ask what for, Don't ask what for

Sitting here like a loaded gun,
Waiting to go off,
I've got nothing to do,
But shoot my mouth off

Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie,
I need some more,I need some more,
Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie
Don't ask what for, Don't ask what for

I know the world's got problems,
i've got problems of my own
but anit the kind that can't be solved,
With an atom bomb

Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie,
I need some more,I need some more,
Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie
Don't ask what for, Don't ask what for

You know I gotta go out,
Get something for my head,
If I keep on doing this,
I'm gonna end up dead

Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie,
I need some more,I need some more,
Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie
Don't ask what for, Don't ask what for
Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie,
I need some more,I need some more,
Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie
Don't ask what for, Don't ask what for---Lyrics submitted by roxann.
