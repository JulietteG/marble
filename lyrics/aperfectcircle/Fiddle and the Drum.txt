And so once again,
my dear johnny, my dear friend
and so once again
you are fighting us all
and when i ask you why 
you raise your sticks and cry and i fall
oh my friend how did you come
to trade the fiddle for the drum
you say i have turned like the enimies you've earned
but i can remember all the good things you are
and so i ask you please
can i help you find the peace and the star
oh my friend what time is this 
to trade the handshake for the fist

and so once again
the one i call my friend
and so once again
you are fighting us all
and when we ask you why
you raise your sticks and cry and we fall
oh my friend how did you come 
to trade the fiddle for the drum.
you say we have turned
like the enimies you've earned
but we can remember all the good things you are
and so we ask you please
can we help you find the peace and the star
oh my friend we have all come
to fear the beating of your drum---Lyrics submitted by Justin.
