Let's spend more time together
I need you inside, I need to feel you near to me
Let's spend more time together
Whenever we touch, you're reaching every part of me
And while we shiver with this new desire
I need to feel the fire forever
Let's spend more time together
we don't wanna lose initial thrill...

Let's spend more time together
The places we go will always be a mystery
Let's stay this way forever
It feels like a dream whenever you discover me
One night is over but I want you so
The way you keep my body slow burning
Let's move in time together
We don't wanna lose initial thrill...

Let's spend more time together
The places we go will always be a mystery
Let's stay this way forever
It feels like a dream whenever you discover me
One night is over but I want you so
The way you keep my body slow burning
Let's move in time together
We don't wanna lose...
We don't wanna lose initial thrill...---Lyrics submitted by VivianBesas-Capia.
