If you need someone to lower the light
And then you want someone to hold you real tight
Someone who'll hold you and do it up right 
Keep me in mind!

If you feel lonely and long for a kiss
And then you want someone who'll bring you some bliss
Someone who'll kiss you and never resist 
Keep me in mind!

Give me a call
Knock on my door
Send me a telegram
Yell down the hall
Beat on the floor
An' I'll come runnin' wherever I am!

If you need someone to whom you can cling
An' then you want someone who'll mean ev'rything
Someone who'll love if you'll buy the ring 
Keep me in mind!

Keep me in mind!

Keep me in mind!

Give me a call
Knock on my door
Send me a telegram
Yell down the hall
Beat on the floor
An' I'll come runnin' wherever I am!

If you need someone to whom you can cling
An' then you want someone who'll mean ev'rything
Someone who'll love if you'll buy the ring 
Keep me in mind 
Keep me in mind 
Keep me in mind!---Lyrics submitted by kerry bufford.
