To lift the sun,
I've been sitting here all night long
Rolling rock, over Buddah with the longhorn
Got a hole, rip a pocket off my uniform
With the black watch boys
Get your heads down
Oooh
Duty calls, but it's way too late
I'm too far gone
Waiting for God, oh hell
With my pants down
Crack the stash
Then be quiet in the midday sun
I miss my dog, and I miss my freedom
Ooh ooh oohh

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's by my side, and I know I'm right
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's by my side, and I know I'm right

I hate the things I think about you
When I'm all alone
I know you're tough
But I've been gone
For so long
Play the memories of you
Inside my head
So all these pictures of us
Burn and radiate
Watch the clouds, and I'm falling
Falling through the cracks
Head beats
And my heart is pounding fast
Off the ground
Into the starry dark, into your arms
I'm falling
Ooh ooh oohh

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's by my side, and I know I'm right
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's by my side, and I know I'm right

I pray my body's right
I've got to stay alive
I've gotta take a chance and keep on moving
Keep on moving

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's by my side, and I know I'm right
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's by my side, and I know I'm right

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's by my side, and I know I'm right
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's by my side, and I know I'm right---
