Use me, I'm beautiful
Take me, I'm yours
Hurt me, it feels like medicine
And all I deserve

People have funny things
Swimming inside
They swing like pendulums
They turn back the tides

Darling, I don't need money
I could be happy with someone to love

Oh what a crazy time
I've been a fool
On a wild ride to oblivion
I lost my mind

But with you, it's understood
You make me feel strong
Your arms look so powerful
When they hold me down

Darling, I don't need money
I could be happy with someone to love

Everyone looks dangerous
and no one keeps their promises
And I am always running
With you in your dark places

Regretting, feeling, remembering, something, we never said (regretting)
We wish we said (something)
We should have said (regretting)
We could have said (something)

Truly, I don't need money
Or strangers to love me
Or diamonds and pearls
Or fast cars
Designed for the rock stars
I could be happy
With someone to trust
With someone to love
With someone to trust

(Use me....I'm  beautiful....take me....I'm yours)---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
