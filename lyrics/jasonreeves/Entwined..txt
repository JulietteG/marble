Entwined
all that we are is defined
by eachothers shipwrecked hearts
and i shiver to think
what would have been if i wouldnt have seen you in time..
would we pass by??

like parachutes and air balloons
or satellites and lonely moons
we'd still be drifting far apart
but thank the stars we are
entwined..

all that you are is mine
your divine imperfections color the dark
and i shiver to see
how fragile you are when the world's such a cruel place to be..
then you cut me free...

CHORUS

let's walk the tightrope together
without a safety net..
and when we fall
and we will fall
let's fall forever..
