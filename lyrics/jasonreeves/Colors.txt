you've got your mind on the horizon. letting clouds get to your head, yeah yeah.
i can tell just by your shy smile, you've got yourself in love again.
now you're shining brighter than the sun. (shinin' brighter than the sun)
shinin' brighter than the sun, (shinin' brighter than the sun) ooh yeah

and nothin' bad can ever happen, you're lookin' forward the rain, yeah.
i know you put this all behind you, yet i'm still running from the pain.
cause i still remember that may, its all in fun.
and i still remember feeling lighter than sun...

i've got my mind on the horizon. letting colors move my head.
hope you find what you've been needing, yeah, i hope i end up where you are, someday
shinin' brighter than the sun (shinin' brighter than the sun) oooh yeah
shinin' brighter than the sun (shinin' brighter than the sun) yeeeah.

[song ends with whistling of  "got your mind on the horizon..." chorus to fade out]---Lyrics submitted by kayleigh.
