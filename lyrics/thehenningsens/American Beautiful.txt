She puts her boots and bandana on
She has a hankerin' for Rolling Stones
She likes her vegetables home grown
A lot like the boy waiting out in the truck

She'll take a hill like Roosevelt
Holds up her pants with a bible belt
She cracks em up like the liberty bell
A whole lot of tender and a little bit tough

Ooo, ooo, ooo she's a little unusual
Ooo, ooo, ooo she's American beautiful

Well, he is a mutt with a pedigree
Sinatra junkie in a pair of jeans
He pays his dues in the land of the free
He says, why walk baby, we were born to run

Ooo, ooo, ooo he's a little unusual
Ooo, ooo, ooo he's American beautiful
Yeah yeah

I saw that girl in the mirror once
With a boy like that, in a cloud of dust
I think they look a lot like us
Cause we are, we are, we are

Ooo, ooo, ooo, we are a little unusual
Ooo, ooo, ooo, we are American beautiful
Yeah yeah
Ooo, ooo, ooo, we are a little unusual
Ooo, ooo, ooo, we are American, American, American beautiful---
