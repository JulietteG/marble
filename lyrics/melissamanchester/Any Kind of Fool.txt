Early morning whole town is sleeping
I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
And the secrets I'm keeping
So hard, waiting
Anticipating
These words that I've been hiding

Any kind of fool
Any kind of fool would take a chance
And go and say
I love you, (I love you)
Any kind of heart
Any kind of heart would surely feel the pain and breaj
The secret in the night
From holdin' all that love inside

Early mornin'
I'm feelin' restless
I go out walkin'
Talk my self senseless
Sooner or later
You've got to hear
These words that I've been hiding

Any kind of fool
Any kind of fool would take a chance and go and say
I love you (I love you)
Any kind of heart
Any kind of heart would surely feel the pain and break
A secret in the night
From holdin' all that love inside

Like a restless child 
With dreams that can't be broken
I'm longing for the night
And waiting for the moment
I'm waiting for the moment

Any kind of fool
Any kind of fool would take a chance
And go and say
I love you (I love you)
Any kind of heart
Any kind of heart would surely feel the pain and break
A secret in the night
Any kind of fool
Any kind of fool would take a chance 
And go and say
I love you (I love you)
Any kind of heart---Lyrics submitted by Cyndie.
