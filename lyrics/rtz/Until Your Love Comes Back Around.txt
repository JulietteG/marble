I thought I spoke to you last evening 
I woke up cryin in my sleep 
I dreamed that we were still together 
But now I'm back out on the street 

I've been runnin so hard 
Tryin to find the place 
Where my baby might be stayin 
I've just gotta see her face 

I know there's lots of lonely people 
Cryin all around the world 
And this is just another story 
About a boy who lost his girl 

Well I'm not expecting changes 
To happen overnight 
But baby if you're listening 
Wont you come home and make it right 

Until your love comes back around 
Until your love comes back around 
I can't get my feet back on the ground 
And things wont seem the same 

I hope you're thinking bout me baby 
Though I don't wish you any pain 
But if you miss me like I miss you darlin 
You must be livin in the rain 

I've been runnin so hard 
Tryin to find the place 
Where my baby might be stayin 
I've just gotta see her face 

Chorus 

I hope you're thinking bout me baby 
Though I don't wish you any pain 
But if you miss me like I miss you darlin 
You must be livin in the rain 

Well I know we aint been speakin much lately 
Lord, but you gotta bring her back to me 
I wont make any promises that I can't keep 
But you know I'm a better man when I'm not alone you see
