when i think back on these times
and the dreams we left behind
ill be glad cause i was blessed
to get to have you in my life
when i look back on theses days
ill look and see your face
you were right there for me

Chorus
in my dreams ill always see you soar above the sky
in my heart there will always be a place for you for all my life
ill keep a part of you with me 
and everywhere i am there you'll be
and everywhere i am there you'll be

well you showed me how it feels 
to feel the sky within my reach
and ill always will remember 
all the strength you gave to me
your love made me make it through
oh i owe so much to you
you were right there for me


Chorus
in my dreams ill always see you soar above the sky
in my heart there will always be a place for you for all my life
ill keep a part of you with me 
and everywhere i am there you'll be

cause i always saw in you my light my strenght
and i want to thank you now for all the ways 
you were right there for me
you were right there for me
you were right there for me

oh oh

Chorus
in my dreams ill always see you soar above the sky
in my heart there will always be a place for you for all my life
ill keep a part of you with me 
and everywhere i am there you'll be
and everywhere i am there you'll be
there you'll be---Lyrics submitted by Margaret.
