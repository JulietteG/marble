Before you met me I was a fairy princess
I caught frogs and called them prince
And made myself a Queen
Before you knew me I'd traveled 'round the world
I slept in castles
And fell in love
Because I was taught to dream

I found mayonnaise bottles and poked holes on top
To capture Tinker Bell
And they were just fireflies to the untrained eye
But I could always tell

I believe in fairy tales
And dreamer's dreams
Like bedsheet sails
I believe in Peter Pan
And miracles, and anything I can to get by
And fireflies

Before I grew up I saw you on a cloud
I could bless myself in your name
And pat you on your wings
Before I grew up I heard you whisper so loud
life is hard and so is love
Child, believe in all these things

I found mayonnaise bottles and poked holes on top
To capture Tinker Bell
they were just fireflies to the untrained eye
But I could always tell

I believe in fairy tales
And dreamer's dreams
Like bedsheet sails
And I believe in Peter Pan
And miracles, and anything I can to get by . . .
And fireflies
And fireflies . . .

Before you met me I was a fairy princess
I caught frogs and called them prince
And made myself a Queen
Before you knew me I'd traveled 'round the world
AndI slept in castles
And fell in love
Because I was taught to dream---Lyrics submitted by Breonna.
