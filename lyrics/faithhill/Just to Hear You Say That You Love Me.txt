If I could win your heart
you'd let me in your heart
I'd be so happy , Baby.
Just for these arms to be
holdin' you close to me
There's nothin' in this world I won't try
No limit to what I'd do
To make you mine, 'cause
I'd climb right up to the sky
I'd take down the stars
Just to be in your arms, Baby.
I'd go and capture the moon
That's what I would do
Just to hear you say that you love me.
Just to hear you say that you love me.
If I could taste your kiss
There'd be no sweeter gift
Heaven could offer, Baby
I want to be the one
Livin' to give you love
I'd walk across this world just to be
Close to you 
'cause I want you
Close to me, Yeah
I'd climb right up to the sky
I'd take down the stars 
Just to be in your arms, Baby
I'd go and capture the moon
that's what I would do
Just to hear you say that you love me
Just to hear you say that you love me.
For the rest of your life
love me for the rest of all time
Just say the word
and I'll give you my world
There's nothing I won't do
Baby, just to be with you.
I'd climb right up to the sky
I'd take down the stars
just to be in your arms, Baby
I'd go and capture the moon
that's what I would do
Just to hear you say that you love me.
Just to hear you say that you love me, Baby.
Just to hear you say that you love me.
I need to hear you say that you love me, Baby.
OOOH you love me.
I need you, Baby.
Just to hear you say that you love me.---Lyrics submitted by bert.
