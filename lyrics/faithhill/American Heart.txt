Shes up before the sun, on the run
Another dollar, another day, another cup of coffee
Thank you Lord for giving me one more
She still leans on her dreams but it seems
Sometimes shes the only one who still believes
That life is hard, so she takes it on
With an American Heart

And it beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds
It scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you cant break an American heart

From the small town Friday night lights
To the Broadway neon burning up bright
Were all the same and its in our veins
A spirit that you cant keep down
A fire inside thatll never burn out
If you are the owner of
An American Heart

Cause it beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds
It scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you cant break an American heart
An American heart

And it beats like a drum down in New Orleans
Sings like a Motown melody
It dreams like California
Bigger than the Texas sky
It bleeds
It scars
But it shines when times get hard
And you cant break
You cant break an American heart
An American heart---
