We said we'd walk together, baby, come what may
That come the twilight, should we lose our way
And If as were walking, and a hand should slip free
Darlin' I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me

We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side
We'd help each other stay in stride
But each lovers steps fall so differently
Darlin' I'll wait for you
Should fall behind wait for me

Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true
But you and I know what this world can do
So lets make our steps clear so the other may see
Darlin' I'll wait for you
Should fall behind wait for me

Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead
There 'neath the oaks bough soon we will wed
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees
Darlin' I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me
Darlin' I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind wait for me
Darlin' I'll wait for you
Should I faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall
Should I fall behind, baby, should I fall behind, baby, wait for me---Lyrics submitted by vicki.
