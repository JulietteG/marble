Where are you Christmas
Why can't I find you
Why have you gone away
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me
Why can't I hear music play

My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas changes to

Where are you Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the times done
Isthat why you have let me go

Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh

If there is love in your heart and your mind
You will feel like christmas all the time

I feel you Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas
Stays here inside us
Fills each end and every heart with love

Where we you Christmas
Fill your heart with love---Lyrics submitted by breana simmons.
