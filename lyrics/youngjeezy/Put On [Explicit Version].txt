I put on...(four times) 
I put on for my city, on on for my city (four times) 

[ Young Jeezy] 
When they see me off in traffic 
They say "Jeezy on some other shit" 
Send them pussy niggas 
Runnin straight back to the dealership 
Me I'm in my spaceship, 
Thats right I work for Nasa 
This 7H is not a fraud, 
Call that bitch my bodyguard 
Call that bitch your bodyguard? 
Yeah, thats my bodyguard 
wear a lot of jewelry 
Young dont' do security 
what's whiter than a napkin, 
Harder than a dinner plate 
If you want it come and get it 
You know I stay super straight 
Ran up in my spots and now 
I'm workin Out the Super 8 
Know you niggas hungry, 
Come and get a super plate 
Y'all sing happy birthday, 
Yeah I got that super cake 
Hundred karat bracelet, 
I use it like some super bait 

[Chorus:Young Jeezy] (twice) 
I put on for my city, on on for my city 
I put on for my city, on on for my city 
Put on (east side) 
Put on (south side) 
Put on (west side) 
Put on 

[ Young Jeezy] 
Half bag, top back, 
Ain't nothin but a young thug 
HKs, aK's, i need to join a gun club 
Big wheels, big straps, 
You know I like it super sized 
Passenger's a redbone, 
Her Weave look like some curly fries 
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce 
Pocket full of celery, 
Imagine what she tellin me 
Blowin on asparagus, 
The realest shit I ever smoked 
Ridin to that Trap or Die, 
The realest shit I ever wrote 
They know I got that broccoli, 
So I keep that glock on me 
Don't get caught without one, 
Comin from where I'm from 
Call me Jeezy Hamilton, 
Flyin down Campbellton 
So fresh, so clean, 
On my way to Charlene 

[Chorus] (twice) 

[ Kanye West] 
I put on...(x3) 
I put on for my city, I put on for my 
I put on for my city, I put on for my city 
On... 

[ Kanye West] 
I feel like there's still 
Niggas that owe me checks 
I feel like there's still 
Bitches that owe me sex 
I feel like this 
But niggas don't know the stress 
I lost the only girl 
In the world that know me best 
I got the money and the fame 
And that don't mean shit 
I got the Jesus on a chain, 
Man that don't mean shit 
Cause when the Jesus 
Pieces can't bring me peace 
Sure I need just at least 
One of Russell's nieces 
On...I let my nightmares go 
I put on, 
Everybody that I knew from the go 
I know hoes that was frontin 
When they knew he was broke 
They say damn, 
Yeasy Yeasy, you don't Owe us no more 
You got that big fame homie, 
And you just changed on me 
You can ask big homie, 
Man the top so lonely 
Ayee Aye 
So lonely 
Ayee Aye 
Let me see 
What we have tonight (what we have tonight) 
I'm high as a satellite (satellite) 
I see those flashin lights (flashin lights) 
Cause every night (every night) 
I put on 

[Chorus] (twice) 

[Kanye West] 
Let me see 
What we have tonight (what we have tonight) 
I'm high as a satellite (satellite) 
I see those flashin lights (flashin lights) 
Cause every night (every night) 
Let me see 
What we have tonight (what we have tonight) 
I'm high as a satellite (satellite) 
I see those flashin lights (flashin lights)---Lyrics submitted by Cacey.
