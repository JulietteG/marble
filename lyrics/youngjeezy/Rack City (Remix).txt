[Hook]
Who that on the pole? Is she that on the pole?
Who that on the pole? Is she that on the pole?

[Wale]
Who that on the pole? Is she that on the pole?
If you ain't gettin' dough shawty, you don't get to go
And yeah we up in stadiums, quarterbacking hoes
My money for fourth and long, but you do not get to throw
Rack, Rack City shit
Penny for your thoughts, and a twenty for your titties
And a hundred for your smile, I'mma be here for a while
I'mma be up with them ounces, I'll see you when you out
Stuntin' for the fuck of it, I ain't with the sucka' shit
All the bad strippers gotta greet me with the government
Fuck whoever judge ya', and trick whoever love ya'
But don't expect a ring if you committed to the hustle
Yeah, Rack, Rack City shit
She ain't right like them old rap city skits
I got many chicks, blue and black Penny kicks
Strippers at 30 tellin' niggas that they 26

[Chorus  Tyga]
Rack city bitch Rack Rack city bitch [x3]
Ten ten ten twenties and them fifties bitch

[Fabolous]
Silver Emblem, 2 black Rs
Whos that in the nice black car?
Autops came back up, results are?
Cause of deathbars
Gotta killa fo, fo the llama
Gotta killa hoe, half Columbiana
Half Dominicana, Poke her from Behind-a
Work out a little bit, get the rest from her mama
Black city Bitch, Black outta 03
California king kush, black out from OG
You made ya death bed, now lay in it
The end is here, start sayin it

[Young Jeezy]
Im in my other car, bout to get my other car
You like to talk to him, man, its a seminar
12 carats, man thats all ears
1 through 6, man, its all years
Got mah other broad talking with my other broad
All them in the back talking to mah other broad
Ok lil lay we gotta full something
3 bitches in my bed, bout 4 something
Sal and my nigga hit that
He aint nuttin, Sal and my nigga split that
Suit game, bag it, she might know something
But if she wanna roll wit me she gotta blow something
Yeah you know what that mean, you tonight girl
But if your bull, Ill leave ya wit a white girl

A-town nigga, yeah, strap six

[Chorus x2]
Rack city bitch Rack Rack city bitch [x3]
Ten, ten, ten twenties and them fifties bitch

[Tyga]
Black 4s, red drop head doors
Got ya whore doing shit thats uncalled for
I see these bitches callinI just hit ignore
Js bon ton four, outta hot contour
Aint got em? Erry blood goin stop em
120 in the ghost take the bitch shoppin
Niggas will open it up, cuz they aint poppin
Aint got nuttin to comment with niggas wit no commas
Red headorama, Rack City Junk yarding
I be ahead of these nigga Last King, Guillotine
YMCMB Nigga take defeat
Pack a bad bitch then pass it to my nigga Meek

[Meek Mill]
Meek Milly, Racked up Racked out
And Ill be countin money till I pass out
Hundred racks of hundreds in the Stash house
And Ill be sayin something when I mash out
In the Lambo lookin like a fly
I shine like somthin in the sky
These haters hope I hurry up and die
Cuz my bitch look like she said hurry up and bye

[T.I.]
Me and three females in the CL
Pink toe nails tell like a B12
Tell em all betta keep it on the DL
No phone, no twitter, no email
Diamonds in the chain, none in the rear
Fall the King of Diamonds, bitch you ate shit
Pocket racked up, all big faces
At the party crib, full of broads all naked
Bros hate cases, We pop daily
We stay faded, need no occasion
Latins and Asians, Black, Caucasian
Ill go crazy for days in amazement

[Chorus x2]
Rack city bitch Rack Rack city bitch [x3]
Ten, ten, ten twenties and them fifties bitch---
