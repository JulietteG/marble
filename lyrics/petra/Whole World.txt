Hearts are failing left and right,
Children feel this planet's plight,
Fatalistic fears abound,
And take their toll without a sound,
But through the vague uncertainty,
Comes a bold assuraty,
This world is under sovreignty,
Divinely ordered destiny,

He holds this world together,
With a word of his power,
Safe within his hands,
Until it's own appointed hour,

And he's still, still, got the whole world in his hands,
Tonight,
And only he knows where the sparrow lands,
Tonight,
And nothing in this world can stop his plans,
Tonight,
Cause he's still, still got the whole world in his hands,
Tonight,

Humanistic lies lament,
The holocost is eminent,
Doomsday prophets in the news,
Predicting who will light the fuse,
The flame of his creation,
Isn't subject to a man,
It's final consumation,
Is according to his plan,

And he's still, still got the whole world in his hands,
Tonight,
And only he knows where the sparrow lands,
Tonight,
And nothing in this world can stop his plans,
Tonight, 
Cause he's still, still got the whole world in his hands,
He' still got you and me, in his hands, in his hands,
Tonight.---Lyrics submitted by Jayson Lingen.
