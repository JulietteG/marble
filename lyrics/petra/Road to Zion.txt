There is a way that leads to life
The few that find it never die
Past mountain peaks graced white with snow
The way grows brighter as it goes

There is a road inside of you
Inside of me there is one to
No stumbling pilgram in the dark
The road to Zion's in you heart
The road to Zion's in you heart

The river runs beside the road
It's waters living as they flow
In liquid voice the water calms
On thirsty knees a pilgram falls

There is a road inside of you
Inside of me there is one to
No stumbling pilgram in the dark
The road to Zion's in you heart
The road to Zion's in you heart

Sometimes a shadow dark and cold
Lays like a mist across your road
But be encouraged by the sight
Where there's a shadow there's a light.

There is a road inside of you
Inside of me there is one to
No stumbling pilgram in the dark
The road to Zion's in you heart
The road to Zion's in you heart

Sometimes it's good to look back down
We've come so far we've gained such ground
But joy is not in where we've been
Joy is who's waiting at the end

There is a road inside of you
Inside of me there is one to
No stumbling pilgram in the dark
The road to Zion's in you heart
No stumbling pilgram in the dark
The road to Zion's in you heart
The road to Zion's in you heart---Lyrics submitted by Donald.
