Come, now is the time to worship
Come, now is the time to give your heart
Come, just as you are to worship
Come, just as you are before your God, come

One day every tongue will confess you are God
One day every knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure remains for those 
Who gladly choose you now

Come, now is the time to worship
Come, now is the time to give your heart
Come, just as you are to worship
Come, just as you are before your God, come

One day every tongue will confess you are God
One day every knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure remains for those 
Who gladly choose you now

Willingly we choose to surrender our lives
Willingly our knees will bow
With all our hearts, our mind and strength 
We gladly choose you now

Come, now is the time to worship
Come, now is the time to give your heart
Come, just as you are to worship
Come, just as you are before your God, come---Lyrics submitted by shanta rai.
