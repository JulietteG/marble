In the hotel, I cant remember how the past felt.
I rent a blank room to stop living in my past self.
Fuck now, Im outta here tomorrow.
Fuck now, Im outta here tomorrow,
and when I check out, it wont matter how my names spelled,
cause when you pass through, you only keep what you cant sell.

In the hotel, I cant remember how the past felt.
But in a strange bed, I keep sleeping with my past self.

Fuck now, Im outta here tomorrow.
Fuck now, Im outta here tomorrow,
and when I check out, it wont matter how my names spelled,
cause when you pass through, you only keep what you cant sell.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
