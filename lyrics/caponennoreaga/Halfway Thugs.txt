Word up son
I did cause I had to discipline niggaz, knahmsayin?
Eatin like he live, he ain't live, word up
Nobody can't eat if I can't, word up
If I can't eat God, don't let nobody eat God
You ain't live - I'll eat ya food kid
I'll take your food, it's on
It's on now.. word up

Cause he's a halfway - thug that he betray
If you got locked that ass'd probably come home gay
smack, blood out ya mouth (what the fuck you say)
Break your feeble ass down (cause you ain't in my league)

Yo, now ain't that the pot callin the kettle black
I used to peddle crack, you never sold drugs so stop frontin
I pushed the war button, you cold panicked
Use tools to fix ya fucking face like a mechanic
Dramatic, dynamic, and underhanded
You say the shit that I say for so long I can't stand it
The God bandit, erupt like volcano
Shittin lava, right on they armor, you blood(?) farmer
What Wha? (??)Hasa, gato, nuto cuatro(??)
Imbalance the scales of slaughter, Iraq discipline
and open ya face, spit on the cut, pour the Henny in
?? fuck a popa get smoked properly
It ain't even got to be handed on record
Just me and you, one on one, I'm only one
Yo, the only one, ?? team alphabet
Your power counterfeit, fraudulent, fraudulent yo
Who's fascinated? I get highly lifted and upgraded
You playa hate it, bite me before I made it
My opposition, competition ya code scratched
like gats without serial numbers that don't match
CNN form, gang is called "Art of War"
Yo you weak minded, dumb deaf the nigga blinded
Left behind in, lost and found you can't find it
John the Baptist, observe, mad water
Surveillance my style, exile, feeble and fragile
Not one crew, fuck you up like we do
252 (25 to life kid) CNN will shoot right through
Set it off (what) break you off, just like a big brick
Top that shit, mix and contaminate it
Navigate it, 2-5 the most hated
My satellite will orbit in rap, planet's my oxygen
We poppin it, kick through door, do-rag and moccasin
You can't stop, Lieutenant Arab
Thirsty to have what you have
Bust a new trade, Illuminati be the new age
Masquerade courageous, loud and boisterous in three stages
They try to get my Thunn twist in cages
So get the word spread, spread it like love
You halfway - thug nigga you betray
Yo I used to hang around with y'all, cover ground with y'all
Now I flip turn around and pull the pound on y'all
Dissolve, that weak shit you thought just revolved
like the Earth at its axis, I got access to map this
pure blackness, yo attack this - blood sucker of the poor
My power show and prove, livin on the 5th floor
We at war, with the foolish
Get deducted, lose points, they can't do this
like I do this so what what, what what, what what, what what!---
