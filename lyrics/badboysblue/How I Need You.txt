I want you - now and forever 
- Thats why did you do it! 
I miss you - now that youve gone 
- Im not a type of girl to mess around with! 
I just called to say: I really love 
- You should have thought of that before! 
And girl, I do regret 
Every single word that I said. 
The night is so empty without you 
And lonelynesss falling upon my mind 
Im trying to touch you in my dreams 
My heart is crying - baby 

Oooh, how I need you 
Oooh, how I need you 

Im waiting every nighttime 
- My nights have been so lonely since youve been gone 
Ill kiss you and hold you tight 
- I dream about this feeling every night 
What I mean is: girl, I really changed now 
- Id really love to believe you! 
I swer to you, I do! Girl, Ill never make you blue 
The night is so empty without you 
And lonelinesss falling upon my mind 
Im trying to touch you in my dreams 
My heart is crying - baby 

Oooh, how I need you 
Oooh, how I need you---Lyrics submitted by Jose Cogollo.
