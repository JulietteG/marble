Too long til fall, sick summer in bed
You and a lazy mood
Ten times the fall, spread, sacked, and I've failed
Nobody move, nobody move

To long to fall
Sat shiver in bed
You and a test of will
Too many fallen, too many failed
Nobody move, nobody move

Days with the light off, freezing
You and I, uneasy, livid

Stop, it's too late
I'm feeling frustrated
I see no sign of fortress
I see no sign of fortress

Safe as a cootie wootie with you
Never pretend the chill
Too many shadows, too many sails
Nobody move, nobody move

Summer is only winter with you
How can you really feel?
Two of another, none of a pair
Nobody move, nobody move

Days with the light off, freezing
You and I, uneasy, livid

Stop, it's too late
I'm feeling frustrated
I see no sign of fortress
I see no sign of fortress

Another delay, too many hassles
Where do we go, how do we follow?---Lyrics submitted by soobey.
