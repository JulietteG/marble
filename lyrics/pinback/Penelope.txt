Oh Penelope
Are you filled with air
Swallowed oxygen
That makes you float up?
Is it dropsy?
Will your lungs swell?
Its depressing me
To see you struggle  

Oh Penelope
Are you filled with air
Swallowed oxygen
That makes you float up?
Is it dropsy?
Will your lungs swell?

Its depressing me
To see you struggle
Im treading water with my oars
Glass galleons anchored, oceans floor
Im diving down with all my gear
In search of treasure, para mi corazon

Take you to the forest
Let you feel the raindrops falling down
Seeping through your red scales
Eliminate the faucet
Eliminate the need for water
Replace it with a safe shell

Dont wanna see you floating upside down
On the top of the bowl when I
Come round to visit you
Dont wanna see you floating upside down

No girl
Need you there, Need you there, Need you there
Ooh Release that air
(Im treading water with my oars
Glass galleons anchored, oceans floor
Im diving down with all my gear
In search of treasure, para mi corazon)

Take you to the forest
Let you feel the raindrops falling down
Seeping through your red scales
Eliminate the faucet
Eliminate the need for water
Replace it with a safe shell ---Lyrics submitted by barbara.
