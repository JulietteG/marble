She's posting all the time, but boards are down.
It's a burned out building.

He's spending all this time on his back.
Staring at the ceiling.

They spared themselves that way
I'm with that. I'm with them.

You aren't. You're.. alive, dammit.
Gnawing on the prey.
I think about you, some.

Where to put you
All the backed up again for the burning time.

Insulate a fragile mind.
Capsulize a broken find.

Don't do this, man.
There's another one off behind.
Breaking down the door without...
[x4]
Warning..

She just ignores the time that boards came down.
It's a numbed out feeling.
He just accepts that pain with a hate mantra.
A spiritual killing.

They just relax that way.
I'm with that. I'm with them.

You aren't. You're.. alive, dammit.
Crying on past line. Stay after school.
Crossword filled in non-photo blue.

So they'll never find you.
Can't go through this now.
I'm leaving a message.
Stapled on your head.

SHHAA......
I get the same result.
We get the same effect.---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
