You got me singin...

Because of love
I know you better
Because of love
We are together
Because of love
You have my heart
Because of love
We'll never part

When I first met you
I knew that
life would never be the same

And I knew
That you felt it too
Never feel alone again boy
Cause your love makes me feel so secure
You got me singin

I don't care what people say
You're the one that brings me so much joy
When I look
At your smiling eyes my heart wants to dance boy

There's only you
On my mind
and
I never want to leave your side
It feels right
So let's stay together
Never feel alone again boy
Cause your love makes me feel so secure
You got me singin

It's cause of love
We've shared great memories
The way you make me feel (weee oooh)
It's cause of love
I feel so high
I don't need nobody else
Because of love
Because of love...---
