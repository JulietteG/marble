Everybody wants to be needed
Everybody needs to feel loved
I feel like you been deleted
Cause you lost your love

You don't be looking for true love
Let it come to you
It's right in front of you
Grab it
Though I never will be perfect
I'm perfect for you
What you deserve in love
I have it

Ooh I just
Wanna live in your heart and mind
Be your everything combined
I want you to need me
Share love with you
Till the end of time
Cause everybody needs to be loved

Everybody wants to feel needed
Everybody needs to feel loved
I can name a million reasons
You and me gon get along

You see I'm not the kinda girl you gotta babysit no no
If you have things to do I understand it
Send me two dozen roses I think that's beautiful
But a single rose is so romantic

Ooh I just
Wanna live in your heart and mind
Be your everything combined
I want you to need me
Share love with you
Till the end of time
Cause everybody needs to be loved

Love your technique (ooh yeah)
When you speak (to me)
When I hear your voice
I know love is real
Together complete (I promise)
All treat (no drama)
I just wanna let you know
How I feel

Ooh I just
Wanna live in your heart and mind
Be your everything combined
I want you to need me
Share love with you
Till the end of time
Cause everybody needs to be loved---
