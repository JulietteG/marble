In the thunder and rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Movin up my thighs

Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips
Oooh

I don't wanna stop just because
People walkin by are watchin us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop no no no
I want you
All I wanna say is

Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around
Mmmm

Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around
Nonononono
Weeoooh-hooo
Ooooooohooo
Hoohoo

Dancin on the floor
Feelin the slow groove
My mind is startin to burn
With forbidden thoughts

Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinkin maybe we could
Well...you know---
