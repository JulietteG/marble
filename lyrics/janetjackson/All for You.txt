All my girls at the party
Look at that body
Shakin' that thing
Like I never did see
Got a nice package alright
Guess I'm gonna have to ride it tonight

All my girls at the party
Look at that body
Shakin that thing
Like you never did see
Got a nice package all righ

Hit it: 4, 3, 2, 1

All for you
If you really want it
All for you if you say you need it
All for you if you gotta have it
All for you make a move
All for you

I see you staring out the corner of my eye
You seem uneasy want to approach
Throw me a line
But then something inside you grabs you says who am I
I know exactly cuz it happens with all the guys

So you do what you gonna do
Come on and talk to me
Promise you won't even have an attitude
I'll let you sit right next to me
Don't join the list with all the other fools
That ain't the way to be
Yes, it's cool
Yes, I'm in the mood
Intimidations got that mind

Can't be afraid or keep me waiting too long
Before you know it
I'll be outta here I'll be gone
Don't try to be all clevercute, or even shy
Don't have to work that hard
Just be yourself and let that be your guide

All my girls at the party
look at that body
shaking that thing like you never did see
Gotta nice package alright
Guess Im gonna have to ride tonight---
