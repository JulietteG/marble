Wow, ooh, ooh, ooh, child

Quick to brag nigga, know I been right here 
Lately I've been on, on a mission yeah 
That I may never get another move, yeah 

So tell me what you wanna do? Louder 
But don't do nothin' stupid

All it is is love in the booth 

When the DJ play this we gon' dance like no one's watching 
Hey Mr DJ, bump the track and won't you turn it up? 
I'ma dance all night and I don't care who's out there watching us

Hurt your body, burn it up more 
Burn it up and burn it up more

Instant motion from the second it drop 
We get ahead with the beat is so hot, hot
