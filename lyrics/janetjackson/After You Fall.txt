Who's gonna be there
After you fall
Who's gonna be there
After it all

Your resilience so brilliant
Yeah you stand strong
But this pain you feel
Never thought that uh hurt
Could be so deep
And now trust for you has new meaning

After you fall
Who's gonna be there
After you fall
Oh whoa
Who's gonna be there
After you fall
Who's gonna care for you
After it all

Alone you wanna be
I know there ya feel safe
Its ya go to place
They let evil bare their souls
Take control God has no home
And all the good you do
They still want to keep you down

After you fall
Who's gonna be there
After you fall
Oh whoa

Your resilience so brilliant
Yeah you stand strong
But this pain you feel
Never thought that uh hurt
Could cutcha so deep
And now trust for you has new meaning

After you fall
Who's gonna be there
With you through all
Who's gonna care for you
After it all yeah
Who's gonna be there
After you fall
I will---
