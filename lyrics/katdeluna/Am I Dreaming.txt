See I met him on the beach 
in the summer it was hot 
we were chilling in the island breeze 
then he whispered in my ear 
mami come on over here 
let me take you to your fantasy 
should I stay or should I go 
`cuz I've been here before 
should I even up the flow 
get back & let it go 
`cause in my head I didnt think 
that I can fall in love with you... 

And when we kissed under the moon 
am I dreaming.. 
He showed me things I never knew 
am I dreaming... 
He know exactly what to do 
[x2] am I dreaming... 
Am I... 
[X2] am I ..dreeeeaming 

[Yea, yea, yea, yea] 

G0t my heart up in this dance 
what a beautiful man 
that batchata as we rock on the set 
put his hand over my hips 
started looking at his lips 
im the luckiest girl in the land 
and I cant believe the way you 
got me feeling right 
I dont wanna leave this place 
stay right by my side 
but in my head I never thought 
I could fall in love with you.. 

And when we kissed under the moon 
am I dreaming.. 
He showed me things I never knew 
am I dreaming... 
He know exactly what to do 
[x2] am I dreaming... 
Am I... 
[X2] am I... Dreeeeaming 

Baby wish we never left the floor, I dont know 
dont wanna be alone anymore 
we have something mesured out, I dont know 
are you real, am I dreaming... 

[X2] [oh eh, oh eh, oh eh oh, oh eh oh eh, oh ah] 

And when we kissed under the moon 
am I dreaming.. 
He showed me things I never knew 
am I dreaming... 
He know exactly what to do 
[x2] am I dreaming... 
Am I... 
[X2] am I... Dreeeeaming
