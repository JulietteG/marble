Kat!

I'm a warrior princess; I have got jewel eyes of an eagle
Fly over-head, I see you coming; lioness ride out to hunt for my prize
Its my ego, that won't let me bow down

Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye! Life is like a jungle
Are you brave enough to walk in it
Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye! Go around in circles
Till you build your prowl

Are you wild and dirty like an animal
Can you growl and scream like an animal
Baby go, go, go like an animal
Tear it up, make a mess like an animal
[In Spanish] animal, animal animal animal; deep inside you is there an animal
Let it out animal; be a beast about it

Let me outta my cage, can't you see I'm untamed; I'm like a wildcat
I smell your fear, I see you running; Taste the heaviest poison, one kiss from my lips
I'm pretty evil, savage beauty inside

Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye! Life is like a jungle
Are you brave enough to walk in it
Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye! Go around in circles
Till you build your prowl

Are you wild and dirty like an animal
Can you growl and scream like an animal
Baby go, go, go like an animal
Tear it up, make a mess like an animal
[In Spanish] animal, animal animal animal; deep inside you is there an animal
Let it out animal; be a beast about it
