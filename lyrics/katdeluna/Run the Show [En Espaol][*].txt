Shaka Dee, man
GMB, first lady, Kat
You don't know
RedOne, let's go

Got you [unverified] like fire
Come with me, let me take you higher
on httpI'm the object of all your desire
And your attention is all I require

Don't stop now 'cause you on a roll
Make me go anywhere that you go
I'm that dream in your head when you're sleepin'
I'm that secret inside that you're keepin'

You want this
Don't front, qu qu qu pasa
Speak up cul es la cosa
Ven aqu, let's get closer and closer

I say no
If you wanna take it slow
Catch up, well, now let's go
Together we run the show

I say no
If you wanna take it slow
Don't stop, well, now let's go
Together we run this show

Bite your lips 'cause you know that you feel it
When I shake it you know you're addicted
I see you're lovin' this Dominicana
You like the way that I dance the bachata

Don't stop now 'cause I'm on a roll
Give you that gutta you feel in your soul
My heart beats like a drum, can you hear it?

I know you want this
Don't front qu, qu, qu pasa
Speak up cul es la cosa
Ven aqu, let's get closer and closer

I say no
If you wanna take it slow
Catch up, well, now let's go
Together we run the show

I say no
If you wanna take it slow
Don't stop, well, now let's go
Together we run this show

Me takin' it slow, me takin' it fast
Me like a train, baby girl, when me takin' the pants
Me and you, what I think, that's what the aftermath
And after that you and me could just slip the cash

The pon, the Kat, just smashin' the party
After that, yo Kat, let's mash up the lobby
'Cause this is a dance and this is a hobby
It's fire in here and GMB got me

Are you ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
(I'm ready, my girl)
Are you ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
(Sure I'm ready, my girl)
Are you ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
(I'm ready, my girl)
One hundred percent

Are you ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
(I'm ready, my girl)
Are you ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
(Sure I'm ready, my girl)
Are you ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
(I'm ready, my girl)

I say no
If you wanna take it slow
Catch up, well, now let's go
Together we run the show

I say no
If you wanna take it slow
Don't stop, well, now let's go
Together we run this show

I say no
If you wanna take it slow
Catch up, well, now let's go
Together we run the show

I say no
If you wanna take it slow
Don't stop, well, now let's go
Together we run this show---Lyrics submitted by marisa.
