I got a piece of land out in the country side
Lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine
Been so good to me, takin it easy

Why would I ever leave?
'Cause I know

I got some good friends that live down the street
Got a good lookin woman with her arms round me
Live in a small town where it feels like home
Ive got everything I need, and nothin that I dont

Homegrown
Homegrown

We got a fire goin, down by the riverside
Sip whiskey out the bottle, livin like well never die
Cmon and stay a while if you dont believe me

Its the way that you carry it for the things you think you want
Its the way that you carry it for the things you think you want
Its the way that you carry it for the things you think you want

Ive got everything I need, nothin that I dont (homegrown)
Everything I need, nothin that I dont (homegrown)
Everything I need, nothin that I dont (homegrown)
Ooh everything I need, and nothin that I dont (homegrown)---
