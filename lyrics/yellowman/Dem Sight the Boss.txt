Jah know me are the boss, seen?so all them that talk and a laugh
You know them people dem talk, seen star?

As they sight the boss them amass (x3)

Say that me drive up the bmw and park
Fathead running by when them all cork?
Back off, back off mek the breeze cool we off (x2)
As they sight the boss them amass (x3)

Fathead: becaw you driving in your bmw
And when you park and come out them never trouble you (x2)
Becaw me tall me no short and me know how fe park (x2)
Say you know me get me bike say me na go really walk (x2)

As they sight the boss them haffi mass (x3)

Some a walk some a look and some of dem a laugh
And some of them amass like a snake on the grass
The whole of dem amass like a snake on the grass
Say fowl eat corn and cow eat grass / me naw come last when me are de boss

As they sight the boss them haffi mass (x3)

Fathead: ca me say me and yellowman we a come from far
Know we turn a deejay and we turn superstar
We have one bike and we have one car
We can drive from kingston to sav-la-mar

As they sight the boss them haffi mass (x3) (fathead: me haffi laugh)
The ass last, me cow last but tell you yellowman is still the boss (x2)
As they sight the boss them haffi mass (x3) (fathead: me haffi laugh)

Fathead: caw dem a amass like a snake on the grass
Me tall me no short but a truth me a tall

Me say the (.........)?nowadays it a kinda sweet
Any man naw gwaan dem naw say no thing

As they sight the boss them haffi mass (x3) (fathead: me haffi laugh)

When me a drive i don' love to walk
Caw everytime me walk people see me and a laugh
Some walk, some a talk and some a skylark
Some sitdung inna front and on the sidewalk

As they sight the boss them haffi mass (x3)---Lyrics submitted by doc coleone.
