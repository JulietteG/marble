Did you ever want out of this, out of this life?
Did you ever think about it love, from time to time?
Did you believe in everything they said? Theyre saying things I dont know.
How did you get so far my friend, so far from home?
Do you ever draw outside these, outside the lines?
Did you mean to make others hurt, from time to time?
Did I tell everythings been said, what theyre saying its so untrue?
How could you ever let this life get the best of you?

All these memories but youre still alone
Oh and its crying time but theres still love.
Oh and I tried so hard to get to you

I know you never meant
You never meant those things youve done
I never meant to leave you but
Its crying time and theres still love.

Did you ever look back and wish, wish youd have shined?
Did you ever feel less than low or more than high?
Did I tell you I believed in everything they said - none of it true.
I could have been a better friend, a better friend to you.

And all these memories but youre still alone
Oh and its crying time but theres still love.
Oh and I tried so hard to get to you.

I know you never meant
You never meant these things youve done
I never meant to leave you but
Its crying time and theres still love.

Oh and these trying times so hard for you
Oh and its crying times but theres still love

Ohhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhh, 
Ohhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhh 

Ohhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhh, 
Ohhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhh

Oh and its crying time but theres still love.
Oh and I tried so hard to get to you

I know you never meant
You never meant those things youve done
I never meant to leave you but
Its crying time and theres still love.

Ew in these trying times, so hard for you
Oh in these crying times but theres still love.
Theres still love---Lyrics submitted by brittany.
