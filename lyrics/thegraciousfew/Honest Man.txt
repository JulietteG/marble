With a riot in mind
Comes an angry young man
With a stone from the pavement
Comes an army of unrest
Stripped bare by her bachelors, stripped bare on the ground
Knuckles bared and still bleeding with the blood of this town
They take my home they take my land the flower of my life
They take my friends; they take my love and cut me like a knife
I spit these words at vile lies the worlds forgotten men
Aint no work
Aint no work
For an honest man
In a daze of confusion
Lies a troubled broken land
As they feast upon my table
I am left with an empty hand
Stripped bare by her bachelors, stripped bare on the ground
Knuckles bared and still bleeding with the blood of this town
They take my home they take my land the flower of my life
They take my friends; they take my love and cut me like a knife
I spit these words at vile lies the worlds forgotten men
Aint no work
Aint no work
For an honest man
For so long weve been told
That our paths lead us home
Are we safe from ourselves?
Have we strayed or have we failed?
They take my home they take my land the flower of my life
They take my friends; they take my love and cut me like a knife
I spit these words at vile lies the worlds forgotten men
Aint no work
Aint no work
For an honest man---Lyrics submitted by Irlana.
