Dont you step your dirty foot in here brother
And dont you ever think to come around here no more
Youve gone and done it youll never be the same again.
I want blood and I want it now yes
Everything you see is everything youll lose so
Let it be baby well entertain you
They let you in I showed you out the only way I can
The only way I thought I ever could destroy you.
Wrapped up in the grapevine
Were gonna raise it
Bound and tied
Were gonna break it
Hold your breath
Were gonna face it
Youre going down, yeah were gonna turn it up loud
Whose side are you on and whose race you runnin
Give it up you nearly killed yourself last time
Everyone you see is everyone that knew you were wrong
They want blood and they want it now yes.
A little bit of what you thought was never gonna surface
Its come around its been brought to attention
We let you in we showed you out the only way we can
The only way we thought we ever could destroy you.
Wrapped up in the grapevine
Were gonna raise it
Bound and tied
Were gonna break it
Hold your breath
Were gonna face it
Youre going down, yeah were gonna turn it up loud
Were gonna raise it
Were gonna break it down now
If you never believed baby believe in this
Were gonna face it
Were gonna turn it up loud
If you never believed baby were leaving this town---Lyrics submitted by Irlana.
