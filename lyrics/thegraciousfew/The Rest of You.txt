Walk away I know
Youre not coming back
No one was ever told and you dared not to ask
I had this feeling youd rehearsed cause all the words you spoke were so divine.
Left beside myself your silhouette just passing by.
I hear you breathing fast asleep
Is it really so?
Im tangled up in plaid and basking in the afterglow
I have this feeling we been here to long the circles worn upon these floors
I stand beside myself a sea of change addressed unsure.
If you feel youve got to break my heart
That nothing here could ever heal you
If I could be the mend the cast, restart
Would you let me fix the rest of you?
So I wipe away the years
Youve blossomed through it all
Had my knees been there for me I might have never fallen
I want this feeling to deny it all, deny you felt the same and I
I left you by yourself my faults were there
Waving their goodbyes
If you feel youve got to break my heart
That nothing here could ever heal you
If I could be the mend the cast, restart
Would you let me fix the rest of you?
Youve gone uncomfortably quiet & I am comfortably sad
I given in and resigned you held the reins in your hands
My hearts divided, Ive been placed securely under your thumb
My betters been best and I am feeling unsung
Baby walk away I know
Youre not coming back
No I was never told and I dared not to ask
If you feel youve got to break my heart
That nothing here could ever heal you
If I could be the mend the cast, restart
Would you let me fix the rest of you?---Lyrics submitted by Irlana.
