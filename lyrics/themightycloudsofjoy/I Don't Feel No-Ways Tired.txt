I don't feel no ways tired
I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me that the road would be easy
I don't believe He brought me this far to leave me

I don't believe He brought me this far
I don't believe He brought me this far
I don't believe He brought me this far

I've been sick
(I don't believe)
But God brought me
(He brought me this far)

I've been in trouble
(I don't believe)
But God brought me
(He brought me this far)

I've been friendless
(I don't believe)
But God brought me
(He brought me this far)

I've been lonely
(I don't believe)
But God brought me
(He brought me this far)

Please, don't leave me
(I don't believe)
Don't leave me Jesus
(He brought me this far)

Don't leave
(I don't believe)
Don't leave me Lord
(He brought me this far)

I don't believe
(I don't believe)
That God would bring me
(Would bring me this far)

I don't believe
(I don't believe)
That God would bring me
(Would bring me this far)

I don't believe
(I don't believe)
That God would bring me
(Would bring me this far just to leave me)---Lyrics submitted by constance sales.
