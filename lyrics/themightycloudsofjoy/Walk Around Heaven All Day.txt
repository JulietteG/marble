One of these mornings won't be very long
You will look for me and I'll be gone
I'm going to a place where I'll have nothing, nothing to do
But just walk around, walk around heaven all day

When i get to heaven I'm gonna sing and shout
Nobody will be able to put me out
My mother will be waiting
And my father, too
And we'll just walk around, walk around heaven all day

Dear lord above don't you hear me praying
Walk right by my side
Hold my hand when my way gets a little cloudy
I need you, i need you to be my guide

Every day will be Sunday, my Lord
Sabbath will have no end
And we'll do nothing but sing and praise him
Then he'll say well done
And my race, my race will be won
And I'll walk around, walk around heaven all day.

Walk around heaven.

I'll just walk around heaven all day---Lyrics submitted by gerald  bradley.
