CHORUS:

Oh if you make one step, He'll make two
'cause there ain't no limit 'what God can do
He said "If you'll go, don't worry 'bout yourself"
All you have to do is make a step

VERSE 1:

I'm gonna walk on out in 'Jesus name
I've been false-accused but not ashamed
I got faith in God,I got faith in myself
All you have to do is make a step

VERSE 2:

He sent Moses down in Egypt land
with only a rod in his hand
when things got hard, God said stretch out your rod
All you have to do is make a step

VAMP 1:
I made a step (repeat as directed with lead ad lib)

VAMP 2: 
One step, He'll make two (repeat as directed with lead ad lib)
