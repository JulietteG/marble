words by Sally Rogers and Howie Bursen
tune traditional

Gone to the dogs, the grafters and the hogs
All gone for bombs and for bailouts (bailouts)
For theyve squandered all our wealth 
Now we cannot pay for health
And across the western ocean jobs are wandering

Where are our farms, our fruitful family farms?

Where are our jobs, our decent paying jobs?

Wheres our security, our social security?

Wheres our R&D; for high technology?

Repeat first verse.---Lyrics submitted by Johanna Halbeis.
