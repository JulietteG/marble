What Can One Little Person Do?
What Can One Little Me Or You Do?
What Can One Little Person Do To Help This World Go 'Round?
One Can Help Another One
And Together We Can Get The Job Done
What Can One Little Person Do To Help This World?

Harriet Tubman Was Alone
On The Darkened Road To Freedom
But She Knew She Couldn't Leave Her People Far Behind
Moses Stretched Out Her Hand
She Led Them To The Promised Land
'Cause She Knew She Had Justice On Her Side.

What Can One Little Person Do?
What Can One Little Me Or You Do?
What Can One Little Person Do To Help This World Go 'Round?
One Can Help Another One
And Together We Can Get The Job Done
What Can One Little Person Do To Help This World?

When Sojourner Truth Was Free
She Got Down To Her Knees
Prayed To God To Help Her On Her Way
With Her Voice And With Her Might
She Fought For What Was Right
'Cause She Knew She Had Justice On Her Side

What Can One Little Person Do?
What Can One Little Me Or You Do?
What Can One Little Person Do To Help This World Go 'Round?
One Can Help Another One
And Together We Can Get The Job Done

Rosa Parks Sat On The Bus
And The Driver Said You Must
Go Back Of The Bus Or Else Be Thrown In Jail
But She Stayed and Stood Her Ground
She Brought That Old Law Down
'Cause She Knew She Had Justice On Her Side.

What Can One Little Person Do?
What Can One Little Me Or You Do?
What Can One Little Person Do To Help This World Go 'Round?
One Can Help Another One
And Together We Can Get The Job Done
What Can One Little Person Do To Help This World?

Brother Martin Luther King
Told The World: "I Have A Dream"
He Led This Country's Fight For Human Rights
We Must Fight For Liberty, Till All Of Us Are Free
To Know We Have Justice On Our Side
