There were three crows sat on a tree, oh Billy Magee Magaw
There were three crows sat on a tree, oh Billy Magee Magaw
There were three crows sat on a tree, and they were black as crows should be
And they all flapped their wings and cried, "Billy Magee Magaw!"
And they all flapped their wings and cried, "Billy Magee Magaw!"

What lies out on yonder plain, oh Billy Magee Magaw?
What lies out on yonder plain, oh Billy Magee Magaw?
A horse lies out on yonder plain, that was by some cruel butcher slain
And they all flapped their wings and cried, "Billy Magee Magaw!"
And they all flapped their wings and cried, "Billy Magee Magaw!"

The meat we'll eat before it's stale, oh Billy Magee Magaw!
The meat we'll eat before it's stale, oh Billy Magee Magaw!
The meat we'll eat before it's stale, 'til not remains but bones and tail
And they all flapped their wings and cried, "Billy Magee Magaw!"
And they all flapped their wings and cried, "Billy Magee Magaw!"---Lyrics submitted by Jody.
