Would you like to thre-e-e-e-e-some with me?

You are so hot come eat me up
Such a sin you better stop
And, every night I earn for you
Tonight I will discover you
I count to three 
I will be free
Would you like to thre-e-e-e-e-some with me?

(You and, you and me)

One, two, three
Come fly with me
Threesome is my fantasy
Fold hands all over my body
Threesome is my fantasy

One, two, three
You, me and he
Threesome is my fantasy
Fold hands all over my body
Threesome is my fantasy (x2)
Baby, drive me crazy
Would you like to thre-e-e-e-e-some with me?

I want to play with sexy toys
I want to play with two sweet boys
Ooh, I know that does no harm
You'll sleep in my right arm
I count to three 
I will be free
Would you like to thre-e-e-e-e-some with me?

(eins, zwei, drei)

One, two, three
Come fly with me
Threesome is my fantasy
Fold hands all over my body
Threesome is my fantasy (x2)
Baby, drive me crazy
Would you like to thre-e-e-e-e-some with me?

(You and, you and me)

One, two, three
Come fly with me
Threesome is my fantasy
Fold hands all over my body
Threesome is my fantasy (x2)
Baby, drive me crazy
Would you like to thre-e-e-e-e-some with me?---Lyrics submitted by Ismar Hota.
