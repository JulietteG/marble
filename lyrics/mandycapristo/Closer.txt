I was locked, I was down and cynical
Out of trust, out of faith in miracles
Trying to find something real to carry me home
A twist of fate and you came to turn the page
We collided in a rush and the weather changed
You found a way, made me feel I'm not on my own
And against the odds we found a spark
The barricades they come apart
The time has come, I'm here to let you in (to let you in)

Out of the cold
Into the sun
We could be something right
No holding back
No strings attached
Why don't you come closer?
Lighting my sky
Shaking my world
You're loving me back to life
Heart over mind
The stars align
Why don't you come closer?
(Closer)

In a world that's became too virtual
We connect and the nights turn beautiful
And the light in your eyes is letting me know
That against the odds we found sparks
The barricades they come apart
The time has come, I'm here to let you in (to let you in)

Out of the cold
Into the sun
We could be something right
No holding back
No strings attached
Why don't you come closer?
Lighting my sky
Shaking my world
You're loving me back to life
Heart over mind
The stars align
Why don't you come closer?
(Closer, closer)

Out of the cold
Into the sun
We could be something right
No holding back
No strings attached
Why don't you come closer?

(Closer, closer)

Out of the cold
Into the sun
We could be something right
No holding back
No strings attached
Why don't you come closer?
(Closer)
Lighting my sky
Shaking my world
You're loving me back to life
Heart over mind
The stars align
Why don't you come closer?
