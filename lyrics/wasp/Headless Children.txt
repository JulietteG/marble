The Headless Children
The Headless Children
(Blackie Lawless) 

Father come save us from this
 Madness we're under
 God of Creation are we blind?
 Cause some here are slaves
 That worship guns that spit thunder
 The children that you've made
 Have lost their minds

 This monster that we call the earth
 Is bleeding
 Cause the children have been
 Left alone too long
 This thing that we've made is fat
 And feeds on the hate
 Of the millions that it's taught to sing
 The song

 The Headless Children
 The screams that fill the night
 Fill the night fill the night fill the night 
The headless children
 The madness steals the light
 Steals the light steals the light steals
 the light

 Time bombs in the hands of all the
 wicked warbabies
 Light the fuse of temptation and we
 all burn
 Four horsemen sit high up in the saddle
 And waiting and ride the bloody trail of
 no return

 Sleeping in the arms of a nightmare and
 Wake to find we've been away too long
 This Frankenstein of flesh
 Stitched together back from death
 And preying on the souls of everyone

 The headless children
 The screams that fill the night
 Fill the night fill the night fill the night 
The headless children
 The madness steals the light
 Steals the light steals the light steals
 the light---Lyrics submitted by ali momtazi.
