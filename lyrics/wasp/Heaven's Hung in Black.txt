I can't take anymore 
I have no more wings 
I can't take anymore 
The gates of heaven sealed 

Don't you hear me 
Don't you hear me 
Don't you fear me 
Of never coming back 

Do you know what it's like 
When heaven's hung in black 

I can't take anymore 
The walls are black and bleed 
I can't take anymore 
No rooms here for your screams 

Don't you hear me 
Don't you hear me 
Don't you fear me 
Of never coming back 

Oh, no more tears please 
Hanging heaven black 

No don't you leave me to die 
Don't you leave me to die 
Don't you leave me to die 
No, don't you leave me to die 

And you'll know what it's like 
The wailing walls of sighs 
Hanging heaven black 
And you'll know what it's like 
When paradise is blind 
When heaven's hung in black 

Time 
How can you say that I've no time 
Am I blind 
Now you say that heavens blind, yeah 
*Across the bridge of sighs*, blind, time, time 

Oh Lord, don't you leave me to die 
No, don't you leave me to die 
Don't you leave me to die 
No Lord, don't you leave me to die 

And you'll know what it's like 
The wailing walls of sighs 
Hanging heaven black 
And you'll know what it's like 
When paradise is blind 
Painting heaven black 
Your losing heaven's light 
Heaven's hung in black---Lyrics submitted by Sandy.
