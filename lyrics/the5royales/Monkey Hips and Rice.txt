Geneva called me on the telephone this mornin
She told me that she had something good to give me
I couldna hardly wait to get to my Geneva
And if I told you what she had for me, would you believe me?
It was monkey hips and rice

Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice
Ooh wee I didnt wanna believe it
Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice

I said mmmm, this is good.
Id eat some more if I could.
I didnt know what i was eatin but the knife and fork, they really took a beatin.

Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice
Ooh wee I didnt wanna believe it
Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice

She told me what we had ate for dinner.
Man i took me a chair and I beat her down and down
But Geneva, darlin, dont you know you still my baby
But when its time to eat I just wont be around

Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice
Monkey hips and rice
Ooh wee I didnt wanna believe it
Monkey hips and rice---Lyrics submitted by lucythesplainer.
