Every story has to be about something I suppose
This one says I lose my head
As the feeling starts to grow you know
I can feel love thumping at the doors of my heart

Feel love thump as it tears me apart
Feel love pump as the worrying starts
I can feel love thumping
At the doors of my heart again
At the doors of my heart again
I can feel love thump
Bump-Bump Bump-Bump

Everybody needs someone they can cling to now and then
No more defense, no more pretense
No reasons for explaining

You can feel love thumping at the doors of your heart
Feel love thump as it tears you apart
feel love pump as the worring starts
You can feel love thumping
At the doors of your heart again
At the doors of your heart again
You can feel love thump
Bump-Bump Bump-Bump

This one your a Unity Rocker
Lord stick him in you living room 
And turn out the light eh
Bet you wouldn't know if he was black or white
Boy! Say what's the use in fighting?
Man say, I say you shouldn't really fight
Take him to a Disco Tec
Take him to a Pub eh
Take him to a blues 
And then you play a rub-a-dub eh
I say you shouldn't really fight
Man say, I say you shouldn't really fight
Each and everyday I walk through the streets
And I see man and man whacking each other
Because you are black or you are white
So what's the use in fighting war alright
Because it's strictly Love and Unity we are needing today
And that we will never throw away
We will never throw away
Lord alright
I say just because you brown
You know you fight like a clown
Just because your white 
You know you broke a little fight eh
So what's the use in fighting boy
I say you shouldn't really fight

Eveytime it happens we seem to act a little touched
In this at least your just like me
I think we think too much
Why can't we just

Feel love thumping at the doors of our heart
Feel love thump as it tears us apart
Feel blood pump as the worrying starts
I can feel love thumping
At the doors of my heart again
At the doors of my heart again
I can feel love thump
Bump-Bump Bump-Bump
I can feel love thump
Bump-Bump Bump-Bump
At the doors of my heart again.---Lyrics submitted by larry hankins.
