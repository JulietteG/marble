Pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look ahead the crowd is jumpin'

Pump it up a little more
Get the party going on the dance floor
See 'cos that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you're too bad

I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day

Make my day, make my day,
Make my day, make my day,

Yo, Pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look ahead the crowd is jumpin'

Pump it up a little more
Get the party going on the dance floor
See 'cos that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you're too bad

I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day

Make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day

Make my day, make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day

Yo, Pump, pump up the jam, pump it up
A pump it up, yo pump it
Pump, pump up the jam, pump it up
A pump it up, yo pump it

Pump, pump up the jam, pump it up
A pump it up, yo pump it
Pump, pump up the jam
Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it, yo!

Pump, pump up the jam
A Pump, pump up the jam
Pump, pump up the jam, pump it up
Pump it, pump it, pump it

Pump, pump up the jam
Pump, pump up the jam
Pump, pump up the jam
Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it, pump!

Pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look ahead the crowd is jumpin'

Pump it up a little more
Get the party going on the dance floor
See 'cos that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you're too bad

I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day

I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your boody on the floor tonight, make my day---
