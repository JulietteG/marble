Down south where the air is wet
The red day rules and you can bet
It makes me proud, I'll never forget
My Dixieland

Fulton County Georgia, that's where I was born
With a fire in my tail and a devil's horn
Daddy never listened to my mother's scorn
He loved to play it loud and he played it loud

Look away Dixieland
'Cause we're a rock n' roll rebel Dixie band
Look away Dixieland

I lost a lot of time ten years to the day
I lost a lot of time trying to find my way
If I make it back home, I'll be okay

With ice tea wishes and corn bread dream
It keeps me going or so it would seem
I keep it up, never let up steam
I sing it loud and proud, loud and proud

Look away Dixieland
'Cause we're a rock n' roll rebel Dixie band
Look away Dixieland, look away Dixieland

And when the day comes around that my music's gone
Don't leave me here and don't leave me alone
Just take me back home with the boys in the band
We'll start it back up in Dixieland

Look away Dixieland
'Cause we're a rock n' roll rebel Dixie band
Look away Dixieland, look away
'Cause we're a rock n' roll rebel stomp our way outta hand
So look away Dixieland, look away Dixieland, look away
