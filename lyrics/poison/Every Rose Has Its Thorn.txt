We both stand silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both stand close together, we are miles apart inside
Was it something they said or something I they did? Did your words not come out right?
Though I tried hard to hurt you, though they tried but I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn, yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say, "Love's a game of easy come, and easy go"
But I wonder does he know, has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now if I could have let you know somehow I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now, I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals but the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved a love that night if I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love, we both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new and that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside and to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn---
