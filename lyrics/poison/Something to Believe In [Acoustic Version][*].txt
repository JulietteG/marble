I came home from school on Tuesday 
To find my mother gone 
Why she left Ill never know 
It seemed like they got along 
One of these days Id like to know 
Just where it all went wrong 

A woman torn to tears asks 
Who the real criminals are 
When they told her her husband died 
Fighting in another countrys drug wars 

She said it isnt the kids on the streets without a dream 
Shooting up the dealers smack 
Its them red tape politicians 
taking all the drug lords kickbacks 

Isnt it funny what power and money 
Can do to the soul of a man? 

And give me something to believe in 
If theres a Lord above 
Ah give me something to believe in, yeah 
If theres a lord above 

I got a second job at night now 
Just to help pay the bills 
And there he worked for the rest of his life 
Because his wife had taken him 

Now he lives on a bottle of courage 
He buys at the liquor store 
He did his family real good 
Until he couldnt do it anymore 

Whatever he found 
Why he broke down 
No ones really sure 

Just needed something to believe in 
If theres a Lord above 
He needed something to believe in 
Oh Lord arise 

Tracked some of societies race 
On the old mans face 
His eyes blood red laid to waste 

Well the mirror tells a different story 
Then the one thats playing in my mind 
Every time I swear Im looking younger 
The more lines that I find 

I guess I learned to trade youth for wisdom 
And lust in for romance 
Its all written in the stages and 
Phases in lifes little dance 

When I want to bitch about growing old, 
I think about how many never had a chance 

It gives me something to believe in 
Oh Lord arise 
It gives me something to believe in, yeah 
Oh Lordy Lord arise 
Something to believe in 
Oh Lord above 
It gives me something to believe in, yeah 
Oh Lord arise 

Sometimes I didnt know now 
Things I did know then 

And give me something to believe in yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Mycah Ayers.
