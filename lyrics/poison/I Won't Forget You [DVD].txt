Late at night I close my eyes
And think how things could have been
And when I look back
I remember some words you had said to me
It's better to have lost at love
Than never have loved at all

I won't forget you baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I could
I won't forget you baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I should, yeah

Some times in my head
 I can still see pictures of you
And I laugh to myself
When I think of all those crazy things that we used to do

Although miles come between us
Just between you and me

I won't forget you baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I could
I won't forget you baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I should, yeah

I should let you fade away
But that just wouldn't be me, oh baby

Although miles come between us
Just between you and me

I won't forget you baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I could
I won't forget you baby (I won't forget you)
Even though I should, yeah

I won't forget you baby (I won't forget you)
Memories slowly fade
I won't forget you baby (I won't forget you)
And all the plans we made

I won't forget you baby---Lyrics submitted by Chad.
