Right there
In the middle of a conversation
Wasn't anything special you said
It was just there

Right then
I didn't have time even to overthink it
I loved you and all of a sudden
I was all in

Its like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
They were dancing and taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very clear

That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That's when I know
That's when I know
That's when I knew

That day
I didn't know we were going where the night would end
I didn't know there was something brewing and if it was
I didn't know how much I care

That touch
When you barely held my hand I was overcome
With feelings I don't understand
Not in a million years I didn't think that we'd be here

Its like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
They were dancing and taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very very very very clear

[Chorus:]
That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That's when I know
That's when I know
That's when I knew
Don't you know it
Hey
Thats when I knew
Thats when I knew

Baby

You know (that?) you know
You know what you feel
And there's no denial
And northing's for real
There is nothing to do
Just there it is
Gotta surrender

[Chorus:]
That's when I knew I fell in love
That's when I knew you were the one
That's when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That's when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
(That's when I knew)
(That's when I knew)
(That's when I knew)
Thats when I knew with that minute
Thats when I knew it was that beautiful
Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it
Thats when I knew it baby
Yeah, thats when I knew
Thats when I knew we fell in love ---
