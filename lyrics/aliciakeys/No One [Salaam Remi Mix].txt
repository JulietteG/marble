Verse #1
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

Chorus:
You and me together,
Through the days and nights,
I don't worry cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is,
Everything's going to be alright
No one, no one, no one.
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one.
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you.

Verse #2 
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurtin
You will always be around
This I know for certain.

[Chorus]

Bridge:
I know some people search the world
To find, something like what we have
I know, people will try, try to divide
Something so real, so til the end of time 
I'm telling you that...
