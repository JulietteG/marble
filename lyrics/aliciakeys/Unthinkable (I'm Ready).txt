Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
Im gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
And if you have something to say
You should say right now.
You should say right now
You give me feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something thats impossible to ignore
And I cant take it


(Chorus)
I was wondering maybe 
Could I make you my baby
If we do the Un-thinkable 
Would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready


I know you were sent to me 
This is exactly how it should  feel
When its meant to be
Time is only wasting
So why wait  for eventually 
If you gonna do something about it
We shoudl do right now
We should do right now
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it I  know I deserve it
Its becoming somethins thats impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

(Chorus)
I was wondering maybe 
Could I make you my baby
If we do the Un-thinkable
Would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful
Either way I'm saying
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me Ii'm ready

Yeah Say

(Bridge)
Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings befoe we fly away
I cant say I came prepared 
I'm suspended in the air
Wont you come be  in the sky with me

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Kenya.
