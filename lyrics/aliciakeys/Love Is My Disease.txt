When your gone it feels like,
My whole worlds gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you

(Yeah)

Baby, baby, baby, baby
In my addictive
When I need you here all the time
And I'm not sure if this is healthy
Is it a sickness
Cos I feel like I'm losing my mind

And I know that there's no medicine
Nothing I can take, no remedy
Baby please stay

(Ohohoohh)
When your gone it feels like,
My whole worlds gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease (my disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you

Oh oh oh baby baby baby baby
I get a fever
Just the thought of you leaving my side
Ohohhhh
It's not the same till your back holding me
That's all I need

(Oh yeah)
When your gone it feels like (when your gone baby)
My whole worlds gone with you (gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease (my disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you

Woahhwoah
Heres what I'm going through when your gone
Some serious symptoms of withdrawal
(Ohohoh)
So sick of turning in my bed
Waking up drenched in a cold sweat
(Ohohoh)
Lying here lonely for you
What am I suppose to do
When I'm stuck and I can't get enough of your lovvvee

Ohohohwoahhh baby

When your gone it feels like (when your gone baby)
My whole worlds gone with you (gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now it's my disease (my disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you---Lyrics submitted by Jocelyne.
