HE BROKE
MY HEART
AND NOW ITS RAINN 
JUST DONT RUB IT IN 
IM AT YOUR DOOR
I FEEL SO CRAZY BOUT IT

YOU SAY I TOLD YOU SO
YOU SAW IT LONG AGO
YOU KNEW HE HAD TO GO
I FINALLY CAME AROUND
IM BACK ON SOLID GROUND
CANT LET IT GET ME DOWN
(ITS ALRIGHT, ITS ALRIGHT, ITS ALRIGHT)
ITS ALRIGHT

CHORUS:
YES I WAS BURNED BUT I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
MISTAKE OVERTURN SO I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
MY SOUL HAS RETURNED SO I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
ANOTHER LESSON LEARNED


SOMETIMES SOME LIES
CAN TAKE A MINUTE TO FULLY REALIZE
HIS TEARS
YOUR EYES
30 SECONDS TO APOLOGIZE
YOU GIVE HIM ONE MORE CHANCE
JUST LIKE THE TIME BEFORE
BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS YOU'LL GIVE 100 MORE
UNTIL THAT NIGHT IN BED
YOU WAKE UP IN A SWEAT
YOUR RACIN TO THE DOOR
CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE

CHORUS:
I WAS BURNED BUT I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
MISTAKE OVERTURN SO I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
MY SOUL HAS RETURNED SO I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
ANOTHER LESSON LEARNED


LIFE PERFECT AINT PERFECT 
IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THE STRUGGLES FOR
FALLIN DOWN AINT FALLIN DOWN 
IF YOU DONT CRY WHEN YOU HIT THE FLOOR
ITS CALLED THE PAST
CAUSE IM GETTIN PAST
AND I AINT NOTHIN LIKE I WAS BEFORE
YOU OUTTA SEE ME NOW

CHORUS:
YES I WAS BURNED BUT I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
MISTAKE OVERTURN SO I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
MY SOUL HAS RETURNED SO I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
ANOTHER LESSON LEARNED

YES I WAS BURNED BUT I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
MISTAKE OVERTURN SO I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
MY SOUL HAS RETURNED SO I CALL IT A LESSON LEARNED
LESSON LEARNED

ITS ALRIGHT, ITS ALRIGHT, ITS ALRIGHT  
ITS ALRIGHT (ITS A LESSON LEARNED)---Lyrics submitted by Lashanda.
