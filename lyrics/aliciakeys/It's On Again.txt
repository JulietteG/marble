(feat. Kendrick Lamar)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this! won't you look in the sky?
Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley of peace, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed that, this morning just so the world can see
Got them wolves on me, no watch me like em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my ghost, my eyes
My lows, I know I know, its mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor
Prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by it what

[Alicia Keys:]
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, gold is the only word I know

And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on

I'll simply say its on again, its on again
The world don't stop, it's on again

I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There is no room for selfish, we do it for the people

And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you
I bet you wonder how I go on

I'll simply say its on again, its on again
The world don't stop, it's on again

The work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop
And everybody here trying to get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Nah
So you think you're hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto (ghetto)

I'll simply say its on again, its on again
The world don't stop, it's on again ---
