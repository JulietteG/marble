Nightshade, a pretty flower
You drink the poison and we count the hours
You black out, holding my hand
I dream of letting go but I just can't

Come clean, dark thing
You can breathe the air again and Ill care again
Come clean, dark thing
Look up to the sky again and Ill try again
Come clean, dark thing
You can breathe the air again
and stop pretending

Dark sky, you're barely breathing
Youre still alive but youre already grieving
A headstone, look at what youve become
You see the sadness at the center of everyone

Come clean, dark thing
You can breathe the air again and youll care again
Come clean, dark thing
Look into the sky again and youll try again
Come clean, dark thing
You can breathe the air again
and stop pretending

How we sleep, how we lie
How we learn to say goodbye
You are safe here, you are right here
You could promise you could try
All your love, all your life
All your days of wasted time

Come clean, dark thing
You can breathe the air again
and stop pretending

If you say that you want me, too
If you say that you need me, too
If you say that you love me, too---
