I got this feeling and I hope it never ends
In the nighttime Im your favorite,
in the daytime were just friends
And you know thats how I want it, yeah
I really must confess
That I see myself more clearly when I love you less
I love you less

Dont you know that I cant see
When you stand in front of me
And you know that I cant breathe
When youre right on top of me
Cant you see that Im lonely
When youre lying next to me

I feel so free (now that youre behind me)
Free (now that youre behind me)
Free

I count my blessings and I count my lucky stars
I can count you on my fingers
Thats how small your are
And Im really glad its over, yeah
Im glad I passed the test
Because I used to love you more
But now I love you less
I love you less

Dont you know that I cant speak
When youre talking over me
And you know that I cant breathe
When youre right on top of me
Cant you see that Im lonely
When youre lying next to me

I feel so free (now that youre behind me)
Free (now that youre behind me)
Free

Falling over and I got you
Its like a habit and I have to
It never stops, no it never stops
But this equations not about you
Its only math and I subtract you
You put the 3 before the 1, 2

I feel so free (now that youre behind me)
Free (now that youre behind me)---
