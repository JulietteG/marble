Its now or never, whether we try
I cant remember why

And I cant believe that you were together
I dont believe you let her inside
I cant believe she wrote me the letter
Why did you bother to leave me alive

Alive and ticking inside

We said forever, until we die
But were all offenders
We all lie

I cant believe that you were together
I dont believe you let her inside
I cant believe she wrote me the letter
Why did you bother to leave me alive

Alive and ticking inside

I dont believe that you were together
I cant believe you let her inside
I dont believe she wrote me the letter
Why did you bother to leave me alive...---
