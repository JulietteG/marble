Time flies and I cant keep up
All the years I have to sweep up
Late at night Im in my bed and in my head
And all the feelings start to creep up

Remember how we used to dress up
Youre beautiful until youre messed up
Take a picture cause I think were losing light
This is how we say goodbye
its how we say goodnight

Banging my head against a wall of sound
Wall like a love it brings me to the ground
We surf the crowd, oh we will not go down
I dont want to drown if youre not drowning with me

Late December when were waking
Theres an unfamiliar aching
By the way you held my hand, held my heart
I didnt notice it was breaking
This is how you say goodbye
Its how you say good night

My head cracks open and the stage goes black
I count to 60 and I meet you in the back
I cant stop gushing, Im a hemophiliac
I dont wanna bleed if youre not bleeding with me

We count the stars but we cant bring them down
It's mistake union its buzzing all around
Eight more hours and Im leaving town
I dont wanna leave if youre not leaving with me
I dont wanna breathe if youre not breathing with me

Love is over, its over and you cant go back
When youre older, you just keep telling yourself that
The door is open, even if its just a tiny crack
Up at night and wandering

Love is over, its over and you cant go back
When youre older, you just keep telling yourself that
The door is open, even if its just a tiny crack
Up at night and wandering
Up at night and wandering---
