What's that sound
You got me hanging on and listening to confessions on the telephone
Hear me now
You beat me black and blonde somebody tell me what the hell is going on

You beat me black and blonde
Take it like a blonde
You leave me black and blonde
Take it like a blonde
Black and blonde
Break me down into the gun
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on

Dumb it down
Ill spell it out for you,
Im the greatest fucking thing that ever happened to you
Its over now
What a way to go
Cause no one ever really has to know
Cause he was just another bloody so-and-so

You beat me black and blonde
Take it like a blonde
You leave me black and blonde
Take it like a blonde
And I'll take you on
Until Im gone
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on

Sleep little child
I forgive you
And for the tears I cost
Im sorry, too

Black and blonde
Take it like a blonde
You leave me black and blonde
Take it like a blonde
And Ill take you on
You break me down
And Ill take you on
Until Im gone---
