I made it
I made it out
Just in time to hear the engines stop
I made it
I made it back
Long enough to sail across your sky

Now Im whole...

Dislocated
Complicated everything
When it was so simple to love you
I hate it
I hate it now
How you opened up the sky for us
And we fell through
Stepping over bodies, I cant find you

Now Im whole...

This is Alternica
Desert and the plains
And the ocean waves
Oh brave Alternica
Remember what you know
And youre not alone
All hail Alternica
What you learn is gone
And were going, going

And in the end it comes around
Comes around again---
