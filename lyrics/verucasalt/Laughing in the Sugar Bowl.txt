That day Chinatown burned down
I saw you start the fire
So deep, so sweet, Alphabet street
what a poet what a liar

Gotta spellcheck it
(A) A (B) B (C) C (D) D (E) F G H
Im the enemy

No way oh way oh
Whole lotta love is coming on the radio
Oh no here we go
Ha ha look whos laughing in the sugar bowl

Confused, not amused
Parlor belle chanteuse
The morning after
First act, no tact,
what a playback
wasnt that a Good Disaster

Count it up
(1) 1 (2) 2 (3) 3 (4) 4 (5) 6 7 8
na na na na na

Oh way oh way oh
Whole lotta love is coming on the radio
Oh no here we go
Ha ha look whos laughing in the sugar bowl
Oh way oh way oh
Dirty Backrub is playing on the stereo
Shes the flame and Im the glow
It started raining
Its still coming down

Dont look back
Dont look behind you
Dont look back
Dont look behind you

Lets sing it loud
Do re mi fa so la
la la la la la

Oh way oh way oh
Whole lotta love is coming on the radio
Oh no here we go
Ha ha look whos laughing in the sugar bowl
Oh way oh way oh
Dirty Backrub is playing on the stereo
Shes the flame and Im the glow
Ha ha look whos laughing in the sugar bowl---
