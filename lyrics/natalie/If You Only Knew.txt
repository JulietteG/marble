If you only knew if I got you alone 
All the things I would do to you 
Show you all the things you've never seen before 
All the things that you're girl wont do 
Leave all your friends and come with me 
There's things I wanna do to you 
I like the way you're watchin' me now let me do a little dance for you 
Like this 

I'll shake it for ya, baby 
I'll turn around for ya 
I'll take it low and pick it up and put this thing on ya 
I'll do it so right 
I'll move it left to right 
It's so good I'll make you think about it all night 

They saw you dancin' that pull us closer 
Lookin' in your eyes, all I rather be 
Boy, I wanna know ya 
Come on and move a little bit with me 
I know you do like what you see 
I know you want it 
Come on over and jump on it 

On and on 
On and on 
On and on 
On and on 

I'll shake it for ya, baby 
I'll turn around for ya 
I'll take it low and pick it up and put this thing on ya 
I'll do it so right 
I'll move it left to right 
It's so good I'll make you think about it all night  

If you only knew if I got you alone 
All the things I would do to you 
Show you all the things you've never seen before 
All the things that you're girl wont do
Leave all your friends and come with me 
There's things I wanna do to you (like what) 
I like the way you're watchin' me now let me do a little dance for you (Play) 
Like this 

Pull out a whip let me see what it do 
If I wanna play ya I'll show you a move 
You can turn around, you can back it up 
Drop it like it's hot, let your boy smack it up 
Here's the young heff 
We can freak all night 
Take you to the crib, we can cut out the light 
Blow a little leave we can keep it low 
I do it so good I'll make you say 

I like the way you thing it, you know what you're lookin' for 
From your attitude to the way you move 
Ooh, baby, you make me want you more 
I know you're feelin' on with what you see 
If you can't wait to get along with me 
I know you want it, come on, boy, jump on it 

On and on 
On and on 
On and on 
On and on 

I'll shake it for ya, baby 
I'll turn around for ya 
I'll take it low and pick it up and put this thing on ya 
I'll do it so right 
I'll move it left to right 
It's so good I'll make you think about it all night 

If you only knew if I got you alone 
All the things I would do to you 
Show you all the things you've never seen before 
All the things that you're girl wont do  
Leave all your friends and come with me, there's things I wanna do to you 
I like the way you're watchin' me (uh huh, uh huh, hey, Skillz, come on) 
Now let me do a little dance for you 
Like this 

Hey little mama, play with a tease 
If you're down to please, go down on me 
Please believe, it's not make-believe 
Just note from me I'm not the man to be 
Playin' same shit like you down 
Take the whip to the crib do it right now
Everything you're tellin' me, I hope it's true 
Girl, I can't wait to go home with you 

I'll shake it for ya, baby 
I'll turn around for ya 
I'll take it low and pick it up and put this thing on ya 
I'll do it so right 
I'll move it left to right 
It's so good I'll make you think about it all night 

If you only knew if I got you alone 
All the things I would do to you 
Show you all the things you've never seen before 
All the things that you're girl wont do
Leave all your friends and come with me, there's things I wanna do to you 
I like the way you're watchin' me (uh huh, uh huh, hey, Skillz, come on) 
Now let me do a little dance for you
