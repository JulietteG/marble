Slow dance 
Slow dance, baby, rhythm make me 
Slow dance 
Slow dance, baby, rhythm make me 

Tonight's the night 
Once I arrive, ladies, better grab your man 
Hold onto him tight 
'Cause once I catch the vibe 
This happy beat trance goes down 

You see my dancing slowly 
Your man wanna know me 

No problem,relax don't want him, 
Just take his hand 
And move to the corner of the room 
Look at him in his eyes 
Ooh, do what you wanna do 
Get the beat just ride 

Act like it's only you and him 
Make him forget about 
So then you'd be his private dancer 
Get his blood pumpin' faster 

Slow dance 
Slow dance, baby, rhythm make me 
Slow dance 
Slow dance, baby, rhythm make me 

All my ladies jump up, get ready 
Bump bump from left to right 
My silhouette's so sexy 
Curse it for every lie 

The best is taking over 
Your man keeps looking over 

No problem, don't want him, relax 
Just take his hand 
And move to the corner of the room 
Look at him in his eyes 
Ooh, do what you wanna do 
Get the beat just ride 

Act like it's only you and him 
Make him forget about 
So then you'd be his private dancer 
Get his blood pumpin' faster 

Slow dance 
Slow dance, baby, rhythm make me 
Slow dance 
Slow dance, baby, rhythm make me 

Rob G 
I pull up in a club 
I'm a classy thug, I throw it up though 
And I holla what up though (what up though) 
Now I ain't wastin' time, I ain't waitin' in line 
Now everybody follow me to the front door (come on) 
Straight to the V.I. 
She holdin' my behind 
Being who I am, I'm like what your mami behind 
What you'd think that I'd cash you up 
Nuh uh, no chance 
Turn around and hit me up with a slow dance 
Okay I see (go slow) I see the same booty shake in slow speed 
Now get low I see (go slow) I see 
Bring your A game, you know I'm a G 
You know what I need 
I wanna talk birds and bees 
I'm amazed and I don't wanna leave 
Safe LA, just go ahead and throw me the keys 
I wanna you on home with me and watch ya 

Put your man against the wall 
Back it up and break 'em off 
Girl, slow dance, girl 
Let your body take control 
Put it on nice and slow 
Girl, slow dance, girl 

Slow dance 
Slow dance, baby, rhythm make me 
Slow dance 
Slow dance, baby, rhythm make me---Lyrics submitted by precious.
