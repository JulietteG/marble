Ooh
Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh
From the minute that you
got my attention
I was taken and I have
to mention
I was trying not to let it show
But I knew i wasn't gonna let you go
From the way that you came right to me
Looking all hot with the style that trew me
No one would've ever known it
You would be the one to take this heart and hold it.

You got that extraordinary way
Got to be next to ya every single day
You do something that i just can't explain
Wanna take the chance and tell you
You're the one for me

Ooh, I love you so
Just look in my eyes, 
They'll tell you where this could go
Yeah
Do you know that

Ooh, I love you so
Look in these eyes, 
They'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know

You can say anything you want to
No stress 'cause  I understand you
We got a vibe you can't define
Want everyone know that boy is mine

We walk by and they stop and stare at
The way you hold me when you take me there
At times  I feel I lose control
Forget everyone but the hand I'm holding

You got that extraordinary way
Got to be next to ya every single day
You do something that i just can't explain
Wanna take the chance and tell you
You're the one for me

Ooh, I love you so
Just look in my eyes, 
They'll tell you where this could go
Yeah
Can you feel it

Ooh, I love you so
Look in these eyes, 
They'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know

Please know this
I'll always be right here and
You don't have to look 
Nowhere else babe
Don't think for a minute
This love will chage
Oh you should know that

Ooh, I love you so
Just look in my eyes, 
They'll tell you where this could go
Yeah
Can you feel it

Ooh, I love you so
Look in these eyes, 
They'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know

Ooh, I love you so
Just look in my eyes, 
They'll tell you where this could go
Yeah
Can you feel it

Ooh, I love you so
Look in these eyes, 
They'll tell you where this could go
I just want you to know
