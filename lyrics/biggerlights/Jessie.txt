A little baby in a black dress lately
Making me crazy makes me oh so sad
You've got me spinning in a thousand places
While you're out spending daddy's cash

So tell me tell me that the game is over
That you're done speeding up to take it slower
So let me in don't you let me down easy
I can't let you let me get away

Jessie, girl you really messed me
Up inside this heart of mine, we play
Hide and seek inside my mind
I'll never rest, until I make you all mine

You're writing checks that your heart can't cash and
You string me out just to up and leave me hanging
I can't get you out of my imagination
Can't let you let me get away

Jessie, girl you really messed me
Up inside this heart of mine, we play
Hide and seek inside my mind
I'll never rest until I make you all mine
Jessie, you never ever let me
Tell you what you mean to me 
And your kiss and tell puts me through hell
I'll never rest until you know how I feel

I get you out alone in the backyard
To talk it out and telling you is so hard
So don't let me get away when I want you
So let me get you like you're knowing that I want to

I get you out alone in the backyard
To talk it out and telling you is so hard
So don't let me get away when I want you
So let me get you like you're knowing that I want to

Jessie girl you really messed me
Up inside this heart of mine
And your kiss and tell puts me through hell
Oh well, cause all I really wanted was
Jessie
Jessie

I want you until the end of time
So I'll never rest, until I make you all mine---Lyrics submitted by alissa.
