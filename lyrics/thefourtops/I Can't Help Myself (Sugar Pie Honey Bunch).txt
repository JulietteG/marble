Ooh, sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

In and out my life (In and out my life)
You come and you go (You come and you go)
Leaving just your picture behind (Ooh)
And I've kissed it a thousand times (Ooh)

When you snap your finger or wink your eye
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings
And there's nothing that I can do, ooh

I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself

'Cause sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love, you see

Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through and I try
But every time I see your face (Can't help myself)
I get all choked up inside

When I call your name
Girl, it starts to flame (Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart)
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide

'Cause sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I'm waiting for you (Waiting for you)
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else, ooh

Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
I'd do anything you ask me to (Ask me to)
I can't help myself
I want you and nobody else, ooh

Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I love you (Love you)
I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself, ooh

Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch)
You know that I love you---
