this song is dedicated
to my homies, in that gansta lean
why u had to go, sooo soon,it seems like yesterday 
we were hanging, around the hood
now im goin, keep youre memorie alive
like i always should 
a lifetime of memories, goin down the drain
i like to keep steppin
but i cant get passed the pain....
i tipped my 40 to youre memories
take a drink, and i, start to think, and i
i know one day soon,will be,will be
hanging out..
(chorus)
this is for my homies
(this is for my homies,well,well)
see u when i get there
in that,gansta lean, that gansta lean
this is for my homies
(this is for my homies, wellll)
see u when i get there
in that gansta lean, that gansta lean...
    (verse 2)
my god, my god..
could u pass on a message for me (huh)
tell him to put down them dice for a second, lord
listen to his homie
could u tell him,i'll never let go of his memorie
soo his son will know
u dont have to cry,no,no
cuz god's got his back, i said god's got his back
     (hook)
a lifetime of memories, (lifetime of memories) goin down the drain
   (goin down the drain)
i like to keep steppin, (i would,oh no) but i cant get passed the pain.....
i tipped my 40 to youre memories
take a drink,and i, start to think, and i
i know one day soon, will be, will be 
hanging out
  (chorus)
this is for my homies (this is for my..homies)
see u when i get there
in that gansta lean, that gansta lean
this is for my homies (u know i miss u,u know i miss u,my homie)
see u when i get there
(talkin)
this is for my homie(i cant believe that youre gone)
see u when i get i there
this is for my homie
see u when i get there
