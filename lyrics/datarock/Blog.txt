Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today to give you Datarock
Electric word Datarock
It means information and rock and roll
But were here to tell you
Theres something else
The world wide web
A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun
Day or night

Everybody knows times they are all changing
Even Datarock ch-change to give you the blog

We know this blog is long awaited
Just couldnt be done on C64s
Communications direct
The lingo's abbreviated
Well pour our souls out open source

Jon Pareles said our mind is fully the present
And so the peak of pop evolution presents The Blog

Hey information highway
We'll be online till the break of day
Hey computer age
You dont need a house if you've got a home page---Lyrics submitted by Seras.
