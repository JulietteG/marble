wanna hold your hands tonight
I wanna walk you home from school
I wanna take you on a date
I wanna treat you like a fool

Now dont you worry about me
New romantic
I wouldnt worry 'less she'll agree

I wanna hold you in my arms
I wanna squeeze you good and tight
I wanna fly you to the moon
I want to dance with you all night

Now dont you worry about me
New romantic
My good intention, you'll see, is authentic

Caus I know loving aint easy
Although its easy on the eyes
Both when appalling and pleasing
Love is alright

Take me on, Amarillion
Take on me, Amarillion

I wanna hold your hands tonight
[Must have been something she said]
I wanna walk you home from school
[Ch-ch-change]
I wanna take you on a date
[Cut away thoughts with the one armed scissor]
I want to treat you like a fool
[Hes gonna treat her mean and cool]

Now dont you worry about me
New romantic
My good intention, you'll see, is authentic.

Caus I know loving aint easy
Although its easy on the eyes
Both when appalling and pleasing
Love is alright

Take me on, Amarillion
Take on me, Amarillion

Take me out, Amarillion
Take me in, Amarillion ---Lyrics submitted by Seras.
