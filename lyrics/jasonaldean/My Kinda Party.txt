I worked all week.
Cleaned up, clean cut, and clean shaved.
Got the cover off a 68.
I fired it up, and let them horses sing.
A little pretty thing.
A little tan leg Georgia dream.
Shes a rockin them holey jeans.
Baby, what you got goin on Saturday?
You know, words got it, theres gonna be a party,
Out of town about half a mile.
Four wheel drives and big mud tires.
Muscadine wine

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you can find me.
In the back of a jacked up tailgate.
Sittin round watchin all these pretty things.
I Get down in that Georgia clay.
And Ill find peace.
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink.
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank.
Lets get this thing started.
Its my kind of party.

Well if you wanna drink.
Go on baby, just do your thing.
But give up your keys.
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while well sneak away from the bonfire.
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside.
Gotcha sippin on the moonshine.
Baby, if youre in mood and you can settle for a one night rodeo.
If you can be my tan-legged Juliet,
Ill be your Redneck Romeo.

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you can find me.
In the back of a jacked up tailgate.
Sittin round watchin all these pretty things.
I Get down in that Georgia clay.
And Ill find peace.
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink.
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank.
Lets get this thing started.
Its my kind of party.

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you can find me.
In the back of a jacked up tailgate.
Sittin round watchin all these pretty things.
I Get down in that Georgia clay.
And Ill find peace.
In the bottom of a real tall cold drink.
Chillin' with some Skynyrd and some old Hank.
Lets get this thing started.
Its my kind of party.

Haha, y'all ready for this?
Y'all go head and turn it on up.---Lyrics submitted by elizabeth.
