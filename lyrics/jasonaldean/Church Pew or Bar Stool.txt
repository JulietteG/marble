Not a whole lot going on
A small town Friday night
Revving up at a red light
On your mark, get set, go

Past a mom and pop restaurant
Same four trucks parked out front
I guess you gotta make your own fun
When you're stuck in a place this slow

There's only two means of salvation around here
That seem to work
Whiskey or the Bible
A shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying

And I don't want to fall in the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
In this church pew or bar stool kind of town?

I'm like that A-M station
That never comes in right
'Til you pass the city limit sign
That's the only time it all gets clear

Well, it's crystal clear
That I just need to find
A place where there is no lines
And nothing like it is around here

Someplace where it don't feel like
This world revolves around
Whiskey or the Bible
A shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying

And I don't want to fall in the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
In this church pew or bar stool kind of town?

Here it sometimes feels
Just like this world revolves around
Whiskey or the Bible
A shot glass or revival

When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying

And I don't want to fall in the same rut
That everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
In this church pew or bar stool kind of town?

Well, I need to get out
Of this church pew or bar stool kind of town
Yeah, yeah---
