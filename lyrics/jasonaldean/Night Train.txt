Ive been thinkin bout you all day baby
Waitin on that sun to go down
Whatcha say I pick you up after work
Slide over we slip out to the outskirts of town
I got a blanket and a fifth of comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
Its supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like Im gonna have to hold you tight
Yeah . . .

About a mile off old mill road
That spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin
Hurry up girl I hear it comin
Got a moon and a billion stars
Sound of steel and old boxcars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, lets go listen to the night train

Yeah, I hope its gonna be a long one
And if were lucky its movin slow
Wouldnt mind if it lasted all night
Lyin next to you on that hillside
Lets go . . .

Come on baby, lets go listen to the night train
