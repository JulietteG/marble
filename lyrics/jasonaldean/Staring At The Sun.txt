She's like starin' at the sun
She could easily blind someone
Other women, I see none
She's like starin' at the sun

She gets on you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She'll always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She ain't goin' nowhere

She's like standin' in the rain
Washes all my cares away
At the end of a long, hot day
She's like standin' in the rain

She gets on you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She'll always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She ain't goin' nowhere

She gets on you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She'll always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She ain't goin' nowhere

She's like finally coming home
And seeing that light in the window on
After being gone too long
She's like finally coming home
Standin' in the rain
Starin' at the sun ---
