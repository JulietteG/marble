Just what I had in mind
Thinking about the weekend
Standing by the errie with the party lads floaking
Gotta a trouble feeling and going around
Theres just one thing missing baby right about now

I need a sweet little somethin like you girl
Standing there red hot, got that little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
All that I wouldnt do for a sweet little somethin like you

I see you dancing over there with your girlfriends
Got you fine showing off that sun tan
You keep smiling, then smile to me
Like you read my mind, and you know it

I need a sweet little somethin like you girl
Standing there red hot, got that little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
All that I wouldnt do for a sweet little somethin like you

I need a sweet little somethin like you girl
Sliding into my world
Yeah, Ive been needing it all life
Slow cam, just right, to party with a sweet little somethin

I need a sweet little somethin like you girl
Standing there red hot, got that little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
All that I wouldnt do for a sweet little somethin like you

I need a sweet little somethin like you girl
Standing there red hot, got that little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
All that I wouldnt do for a sweet little somethin like you

All around and round in my old truck
Keep you up until the sun comes out
Girl you got some serious
Sweet little somethin like
The way you fly yeah grab that seat
Looking so damn good to me
Here another girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin like

All around and round in my old truck
Keep you up until the sun comes out
Girl you got some serious
Sweet little somethin like
The way you fly yeah grab that seat
Looking so damn good to me
Here another girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin like---
