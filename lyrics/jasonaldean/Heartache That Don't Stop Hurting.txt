I've been here a bunch of times
it all stats with the same old lines it's over baby it's over
nothing about it ever feels good
it knocks you down just like it should
but it goes away it always goes away
something about this time feels different
it's like I'm in a fight I'm about to lose

This might be the heartache that don't stop hurting
it just keeps working on me
it just keeps picking on me
and these might be the tears that keep on falling
they won't stop coming on down
they won't stop raining on down
And baby it's too early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

Man I've tried to kill the pain by shooting whiskey through my brain
But it never works it only makes it worse
So tonight I'm here again throwing punches in the wind
At some memory that I can't even see
I know that I don't want to let it have me
But everytime it hits I feel the truth

This might be the heartache that don't stop hurting
it just keeps working on me
it just keeps picking on me
and these might be the tears that keep on falling
they won't stop coming on down
they won't stop raining on down
And baby it's too early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

Tomorrow I'll stand up again
and give it my best shot again
but tonight it sure feels like

These might be the tears that keep on falling
they won't stop coming on down
they won't stop raining on down
And baby it's too early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

It just won't stop hurting---
