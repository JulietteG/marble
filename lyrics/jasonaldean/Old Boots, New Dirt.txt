Flipped a stonefish from a waitress I ain't ever met
She asked, "Are you just passing through?"
I smiled and said, "I don't know yet"
I walked around the town square
Down the street to where
I met the preacher and the old courthouse band
Yeah, nothing helps you start again like

Old boots, new dirt, no reminders
I've got a feeling this town will get me over her
You've been through what I've been through man
Nothing feels better than old boots, new dirt

There's a thousand faces that I ain't seen before
The only history that I can see is from a civil war
It's good for me to look around
Go down roads she ain't been down
No memories of our used to be's, set me free

Old boots, new dirt, no reminders
I've got a feeling this town will get me over her
You've been through what I've been through man
Nothing feels better than old boots, new dirt

Old boots, new dirt, one step closer
Yeah, I think I'm gonna like it here, yeah

You've been through what I've been through man
Nothing feels better than
Nothing else is gonna do like old boots, new dirt
Old boots, new dirt
Ooh, old boots, new dirt---
