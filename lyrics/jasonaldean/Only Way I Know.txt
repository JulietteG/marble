(with Luke Bryan & Eric Church)

Well I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard till the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care that we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured thats how it was
And everyone else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Dont quit till the job gets done

Thats the only way I know
Dont stop till everythings gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Dont back up, dont back down
Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you dont show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you cant dig no more
Thats the only way I know

That old red dirt the first thing you learn
You dont get nothing that you dont earn
Humble pride that I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
Sun in our eyes backs to the fences
Didnt know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasnt thinking bout nothing but winning

Thats the only way I know
Dont stop till everythings gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Dont back up, dont back down
Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you dont show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you cant dig no more
Thats the only way I know

Maybe theres another path that will get you there a little bit faster,
But Im sticking with the one inside of me.

Thats the only way I know
Dont stop till everythings gone
Straight ahead never turn round
Dont back up, dont back down
Full throttle wide open
You get tired, you dont show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you cant dig no more
Thats the only way I know ---
