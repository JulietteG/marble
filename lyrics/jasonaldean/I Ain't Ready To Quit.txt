There's something about lightnin up a marlboro red
That nicotine rush into my head
And a taste of southern comfort on my lips
Tells me I aint ready to quit

Something about driving way to fast
Switchin gears and hammerin on the gas
And the fact that they aint caught me yet
Tells me I aint ready to quit

Don't start thinking I'm gonna stop
Giving it all I got
If you think you seen love you aint seen nothing yet
How could I ever get tired
Of wakin up by your side
And the taste of your sweet kiss
Tells me I aint ready to quit

There's something about the way you say my name
That drives this old country boy insane
So baby don't don't stop loving me like this
Cause I aint ready to quit

Don't start thinking I'm gonna stop
Giving it all I got
If you think you seen love you aint seen nothing yet
How could I ever get tired
Of waking up by your side
And the taste of your sweet kiss
Tells me I aint ready to quit

Don't start thinking I'm gonna stop
Girl I'm giving it all I got
If you think you seen love you aint seen nothing yet
How could I ever get tired
Of wakin up by your side
And the taste of your sweet kiss
And the taste of your sweet kiss
Tells me I aint ready to quit---
