I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Burning made it a U drive
Burning a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warning from the blue light
It's only going 9 o'clock but feels more like midnight

We ain't even turned up the radio
Baby two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta hold on through my lap
Already have the time of my live
And we're just getting started tonight

Girl you already got the wind down
And you got your seat laid back
I ain't even make it halfway to town
And you already talking about a 6 stack
Already got your shoes off
And you talking about slippin' off
No we ain't even found your friends saying
You already wanna get lost

We ain't even turned up the radio
Baby two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta hold on through my lap
Already have the time of my live
And we're just getting started tonight

Ain't had a drink and I'm torn up
Ain't even had a taste of your love
But girl the crazy thing is
We're just getting warmed up

We ain't even turned up the radio
Baby two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta hold on through my lap
Already have the time of my live
And we're just getting started tonight---
