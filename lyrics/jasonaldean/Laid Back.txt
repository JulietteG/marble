Got our headlights circled, Chevrolet
Saturday night at a river bank
Silver bullets popping, got the speakers rocking
A feel good song that'll take you back
Watching them pretty girls work that
Baby, shake it just right, I could do this all night

Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back, working on our laid back

There's no last call or closing time
Just good stuff passing left and right
Let that homemade hit you
You know I'll be right there with you
Dancing in the dust and half past gone
Turn it up and sing along
No matter what you got playing
Wanna see your body swaying

Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back, working on our laid back

Out here way back, you can feel that country high
Out here way back, you can do what you want to do tonight

Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back, working on our laid back ---
