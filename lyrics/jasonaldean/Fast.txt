Goodbye crack of dawn
Goodbye harvester
Goodbye hello baby
After a long hard day
Of plowing dirt

Goodbye way of life
Goodbye pass it down
Goodbye up all night
Of praying for rain
A two year drought
Walking on faith
And toughing it out

Hey, what's past is past
Oh, nothin' in this world lasts
Hey, aren't those four lanes fast?

Goodbye gravel road
Thanks for the ride
For watchin' over me
Remember the time

I rolled my truck
And you were there
When I woke up
You walked me home
Yeah, you lead me home

But hey, what's past is past
Oh, nothin' in this world lasts
Hey, aren't those four lanes fast?

Goodbye, tomorrow's another day
In no time it only moves one way
Away from yesterday
But memories never fade

What's past is past
Oh nothin', nothin' in this world lasts
Hey, aren't those four lanes fast?

Aren't they fast?
What's past is past
Aren't they fast?
Aren't they fast?---
