It's 2 A.M. in my new home, this motel room
An ash tray full of lucky strikes
A half spent case of warm Budlight
Countin' regrets, fightin' back tears
Retracin' steps, gettin' no where

[Chorus]
Callin your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion
Where there's no love left
It's like tryin to put smoke back in this cigarette

Come sunrise, guess I'll checkout and ditch this town
Put a few more miles between us
And keep driving till I finally mend my broken trust
Hangin' my hopes on highway signs
If I lie here, I'll loose my mind

[Chorus]
Callin your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion
Where there's no love left
It's like tryin' to put smoke back in this cigarette

I may never know your reasons why
But someday I'm gonna see the good in your goodbye

Callin your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion
Where there's no love left
It's like tryin to put smoke back in this cigarette---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany.
