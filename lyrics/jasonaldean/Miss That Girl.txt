I found your silver bracelet in my backseat
That you left, it seems like yesterday
It's like I found a treasure when I held it
How could I have ever let her get away
I still got a faded picture on my rearview
It's almost like she's looking right at me
Somehow just like that, it all comes rushing back
She's right here the way it used to be

Yeah, miss that girl
Knowing they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kicking myself for ever letting her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl

Way back then it felt like I had things together
Whenever she'd coming smiling through that door
But I've had one or two tonight
And it just makes me realize
That I ain't so together anymore

And I miss that girl
Knowing they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kicking myself for ever letting her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl ---
