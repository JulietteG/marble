Youve told me bout your family
The town that you grew up in
Believe me, I wanna know everything about you
And Ive rambled on about me
By now you know Im crazy
We could go on all night if we wanted to
But I dont want to

I dont wanna talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is
Find out a little bit more
I dont wanna waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I dont wanna talk anymore

That homemade wine on your lips
My name under your breath
Under one of the best river nights you ever saw
Hey, that says it all

I dont wanna talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is
Find out a little bit more
I dont wanna waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I dont wanna talk anymore

I dont wanna talk
I dont wanna talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is
Find out a little bit more
I dont wanna waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I dont wanna talk anymore
I dont wanna talk anymore ---
