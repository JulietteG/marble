She had a shiny little beamer with the ragtop down
sitting in the drive but she wouldn't get out
dogs were all barking and a wagging around
and I just laughed and said yall all get in

She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
she was looking too good not to go somewhere
said what you want to do, baby I don't care
we can go to the show or we can stay right here

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
we can go slow or make it go faster
down through the woods and out to the pasture
long as I'm with you, it really don't matter
climb up in my lap and drive if you want to 
girl you know you got me to hold onto
we could go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Said we could fire it up and I can show you around
sit upon a hill and watch the sun go down
when the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
we can turn on the lights and head back to the house

Or we could take another ride on my big green tractor
we can go slow or make it go faster
down through the woods and out to the pasture 
long as I'm with you it really don't matter
climb up in my lap and drive if you want to 
girl you know you got me to hold onto
we can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

and just let me dust off the seat
put your pretty little arms around me (hell yeah)

you can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
girl you know you got me to hold onto
we could go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

oh yeah
we could go to town
or we could go another round
on my big green tractor---Lyrics submitted by Vicki.
