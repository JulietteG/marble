Wearing crowns of thorns we prepare to fall
We are broken we are torn wilting on the floor
Stay with me here tonight chase the moonlight

Your hands are turning let go of my blackened heart
Were falling through the hourglass like diamonds in the dark
So we are sinking you bury me under stars
Were falling through the hourglass like diamonds in the dark

Were falling through the hourglass

Feel the sands of time hear the hours chime
Stay with me here tonight chase the moonlight

Your hands are turning let go of my blackened heart
Were falling through the hourglass like diamonds in the dark
So we are sinking you bury me under stars
Were falling through the hourglass like diamonds in the dark

We are burning
See the ruins
Watch us fall to the ground

Your hands are turning let go of my blackened heart
Were falling through the hourglass like diamonds in the dark
So we are sinking you bury me under stars
Were falling through the hourglass like diamonds in the dark

Were falling through the hourglass---Lyrics submitted by Nick Marquis.
