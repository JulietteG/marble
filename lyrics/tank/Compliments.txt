Ladies ( I'm the most beautiful girl in the world)
Ladies ( i'm the most beautiful girl in the world)

In my book, you can do no wrong from head to toe
In my book, i done wrote you songs so beautiful
You deserve every good thing that a girl can give
You should have a life that only superstars live

Oh, you hear  alot of talking 
bout what they would do to you
oh,you see alot of fucks
soon as they were through with you

Let's appreciate you cause you cause 
the truth is that you heaven sent

We can start off with some compliments i can go
on and on killing you with these compliments 

Words can't describe you be let me remind you 
Say i'm sexy ( i'm sexy)
Say i'm fly (i'm fly)

Girl, i can't let you by
Without a little compliment
You deserve every word of these compliments

Ladies, (I'm the most beautiful girl in the world)
Ladies, (I'm the most beautiful girl in the world

Damn your mama gotta be fine from head to toe
Cause i'm looking at a baby she made 
So beautiful
Your smile alone can get you anything
a man can give
I'f i had it i'd give you the life that only
superstars live---Lyrics submitted by starna taylor.
