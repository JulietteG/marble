Come on, come on

Dance with Me
Dance with Me

I'm all into you
I'm tryina find my way
The right things to do
The right things to say
If it's a movie scene
What role can I play?
I got moves with you
Let's just move this way

Can we feel like this, girl, forever?
Come on, come on
Can we do this for the night like we're together?
Come on, come on
Everybody in here look like they wanna party
So come on in with somebody
So come on in with somebody
Let's get on all night long
Let's dance
I'mma show you enough of good girls
Let's play this song all night long
Let's dance, get lost in the music

Right-right, left-left
Front-back, front-back, front-back
Spin to the right, to the right
Dance to the left, to the left
Hands to the back-front, back-front, back-front
Spin

You're such stuff
Keep me in the galaxy
To be who you are
And know the world will see
Special girl you are to me
Can't hold up the bar
Let's just move our feet, girl

Can we feel like this, girl, forever?
Come on, come on
Can we do this for the night like we're together?
Come on, come on

Everybody in here look like they wanna party
So come on in with somebody
So come on in with somebody
Let's get on all night long
Let's dance

I'mma show you enough of good girls
Let's play this song all night long
Let's dance, get lost in the music

You ready?
Get your feet on the floor

Right-right, left-left
Front-back, front-back, front-back
Spin to the right, to the right
Dance to the left, to the left
Hands to the back-front, back-front, back-front
Spin

The fellows do it better than the ladies
That's what they told me
The fellows do it better than the ladies
That's what they told me
The ladies do it better than the fellows
That's what they told me
The ladies do it better than the fellows
That's what they told me

Can we feel like this, girl, forever?
Come on, come on
Can we do this for the night like we're together?
Come on, come on

Everybody in here look like they wanna party
So come on in with somebody
So come on in with somebody
Let's get on all night long
Let's dance

I'mma show you enough of good girls
Let's play this song all night long
Let's dance, get lost in the music

You ready?
Get your feet on the floor

Right-right, left-left
Front-back, front-back, front-back
Spin to the right, to the right
Dance to the left, to the left
Hands to the back-front, back-front, back-front
