Walking by my baby
Walking by my baby
Oh, how I miss you
You, how I miss you
Oh, oh!

Miss the way you call up my name
Miss you cause you don't feel the same.
Miss you when I'm going out my mind
Miss you when I'm running out of time!
You gonna make a man, take his ego and his pride
But you're by my side on a lonely night, oh my God!

Hush, one day Ill miss you
How much I miss you!
Hush, one day Ill miss you
How much I miss you!
Missing you, missing you, missing you
I'm missing you!
Missing you, missing you, missing you
I'm missing you!

Miss the way we dance to our song
Miss the day we laugh all night long
Miss the way we make future plans
Miss when I just don't understand.
You gonna make a man, take his ego and his pride
But you're by my side on a lonely night, oh my God!

Hush, one day Ill miss you
How much I miss you!
Hush, one day Ill miss you
How much I miss you!
Missing you, missing you, missing you
I'm missing you!
Missing you, missing you, missing you
I'm missing you!

Every since you left me, Ive been waiting by my phone
Momma, keep on calling, gonna find out whats going on
Every since you left me, Ive been cooking my own food
Every since you left me, and I know this shit been ...

Hush, one day Ill miss you
How much I miss you!
Hush, one day Ill miss you
How much I miss you!
Missing you, missing you, missing you
Im missing you!
Missing you, missing you, missing you
Im missing you!

Oh my, my my,
Miss my baby, baby, baby

Anybody miss somebody?
I mean, really, really miss somebody?
(Hes talking about you)
Anybody miss somebody?
I mean, really, really miss somebody?
(Anybody out there besides me?)
Anybody miss somebody?
(You speak on it!)
I mean, really, really miss somebody?

Its like you got me here writing another sad song
The way inside that I see us and never past gone
We moved on, and lose your team till that hurts
The way you looked at it, that's still team work.
Do the dream work? I'm still asleep.
Refuse to open my eyes to things I really need
Refuse to swallow my pride that taste the same meet
You ain't by my side, this just cant be!

There's still love, when will you come back?
Welcome to his house and help you pack your bag
You need me and baby I need you
I'm missing you, I cant ... you too!

Anybody miss somebody?
I mean, really, really miss somebody?
(Hes talking about you)
Anybody miss somebody?
I mean, really, really miss somebody?
(Anybody out there besides me?)
Anybody miss somebody?
(You speak on it!)
I mean, really, really miss somebody?
Need somebody, I miss you, baby!---
