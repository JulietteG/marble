As I pour this glass of wine 
I hope it helps me express these thoughts of mind 
(Noo) I dont think I ever felt the way I feel for you girl 
So I'm turning these lights down and I'm telling you right now 

I dont think Ive ever ever really told you how much I need you 
Girl I need you more then my next breath 
Never would I ever leave you cause darling I need you 
I need you more then the next breath I breathe 

I'm sorry for the times that I stressed you out 
And I'm thankful for the times you aint put me out your house (yea) 
Ohhh I feel in love more than once 
But ever single time it was with you girl (ohhhh) 

I don't think I've ever ever really told you how much I need you 
I need you more then my next breath 
Never would I ever leave you cause darling I need you 
I need you more then the next breath I breathe 

This is the part where we slow it down (slow it down) 
Make love to your mind its okay you can think out loud (you can be as loud as you want to) 
Its 4 in the morning and I'm pouring out my heart girl 
So much to say I dont know where to start girl (ohhhh) 

I don't think I've ever ever really told you how much I need you 
I need you more then my next breath 
Never would I ever leave you cause darling I need you 
I need you more then the next breath I breathe

I don't think I've ever ever really told you how much I need you 
I need you more then my next breath 
Never would I ever leave you cause darling I need you 
I need you more then the next breath I breathe ---
