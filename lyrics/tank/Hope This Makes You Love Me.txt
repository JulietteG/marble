Look at me I'm such a mess
And I normally would keep this off to myself
All my heart is filled with pain
And I normally wouldn't cry but I'ma let it rain
So I'm

Praying now
I give to the honest now
I'm reading vocs so high
A better me can't be found out
Fill my lung
I'm broke from what it cost
I ain't got much left
But I want you to have it all
And I hope this makes you love me
And I hope this makes you love me
I be doing everything for you
And I know it sounds crazy
But I hope this makes you love me
Love me love me love me love me love me

Look at me
I'm such a mess
My bride being told
My ego give it the rest

Cause I,

Praying now
I give to the honest now
I'm reading vocs so high
A better me can't be found out
Fill my lung
I'm broke from what it cost
I ain't got much left
But I want you to have it all
And I hope this makes you love me
And I hope this makes you love me
I be doing everything for you
And I know it sounds crazy
But I hope this makes you love me
Love me love me love me love me love me

Come get all I need is to beg you
Emergency I'll be there to rescue
I'll go through the fire to save you
Girl I thank the lord that he made you
By my highest mountain to be there
Follow you wherever you go
Life without you how could that be fair?
I do all of this to let you know
I hope - that this - makes you - love me - yeah
I hope this makes you love me
Say that makes you love me---
