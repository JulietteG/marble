I'll sprung in the fire
I'll burn up in the ring
If that what it'd take
I'll carry your baby
Do the 9 months of pain
If that what it'd take

Can't you see way past of me?
This conversation is pure desperation
I'll dig for you diamond
Brick by brick I'll build you a home
If that's what it'll take
I'll be your soldier
Fight till every enemy is gone
If that what it'd take

Cause I'm completely sold out to you
Ain't make no more, nothing left in the store
Any man that did you wrong
I'll find him and make him apologize
If that what it'd take
Baby, lemme be your fool
Hurt me any way you like
If that's what you intend
Listen, girl, when God made you
He only made one and He made you for me
I'll take my blood and give it all to you
If you need it to live
If that's what, what it takes
I'll spend my last dime for your ticket
On that train to heaven
If that's what, what it takes, yeah

Cause I love you so much I gotta find
A way to love you even more
If that's What It Takes
Throw it all away, I can't find my innest words
Got my heart in yo hands
Wanted for ransom so you'd get what you need
As long as you can
I'd hum for you hmm hm hm hmm hhmm hmm hhmm hmh mhmm hh
Oh oh oh oh oh hm hm hm hm hmm hm hm hmm hm hm hm h
Hmhmmhmhmhmhm yeah what it take
Late I'mma let it write, let it write
Take my time ohohohohohohoh
Hmmmmmhmhmhmhmmhmhm m hm mhmh mh mhm mhmh mhmhmh
Oh oho oh oh oh oh yeah I yeah yeah---
