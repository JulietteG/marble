Father time
I couldn't make her wanna stay
I couldn't seem to find the words to say
Now I have to live in yesterday

Father time
I thought that you were on my side
I thought that I could keep our love alive
I thought that I could keep her satisfied

The clock keeps tickin' and I keep on thinkin' 'bout you
I'm knockin' at the door of your heart but I can't break through

Father time
Grant me just another day
Of our love I tried to make her stay
Father time
Don't tell me it's too late
All my life you know that I would wait
Father time

Now she's gone
She didn't even say good-bye
I guess she didn't have the heart to try
She didn't even have the guts to lie

Father time
Only you can turn the page
And close the curtain on this empty stage
Only you can take my pain away

And my heart keeps breakin' and my body keeps aching for you
It's time to hold on but there's nothin' left to hold on to

Father time
Grant me just another day
Of our love I tried to make her stay
Father time
Don't tell me it's too late
All my life you know that I would wait
Father time

Father, father can't you see I'm depending on you
I'm dying at the door to your heart and I can't break through

Father time
Grant me just another day
Of our love I tried to make her stay
Father time
Don't tell me it's too late
All my life you know that I would wait
Father time

She's your child make her mine
Father time---Lyrics submitted by Churchill Cung.
