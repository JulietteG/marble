Your love is like cocoa butter on my heart
Your touch is like cocoa butter on my heart
Your kiss is like cocoa butter on my heart
Oh, boy, you are like cocoa butter on my heart

My heart was bruised, thats what happens when you use it
Ready for someone that turned it all black and blew it
Been that way for so long the sight became familiar
And then your love came in just like a natural healer

Youve got a way of making it all ok
You make it ok

Your love is like cocoa butter on my heart
Your touch is like cocoa butter on my heart
Your kiss is like cocoa butter on my heart
Oh, boy, you are like cocoa butter on my heart

I show you my burns, you show me lessons learned
I show you my scars, you show me works of art
I show you a blemish, you show me that Gods not finished
With every imperfection you showed me your blessing

Youve got a way of making it all ok
You make it ok

Your love is like cocoa butter on my heart
Your touch is like cocoa butter on my heart
Your kiss is like cocoa butter on my heart
Oh, boy, you are like cocoa butter on my heart

Rub it in, I know you missing more,
You rub it in with your wisdom
Oh, rub it in with a kind word
When you rub it in your love because

Your love is like cocoa butter on my heart
Cocoa butter on my heart
Cocoa butter on my heart
Cocoa butter on my heart

Wont you put some cocoa butter on my heart
Down the sea, they aint got
Down at the store they aint got
I looked and I cant find
Oh baby, only you got it
Said baby, only you got it
Aint never felt nothing like this

Cocoa butter on my heart
Cocoa butter on my heart
Cocoa butter on my heart
Cocoa butter on my heart---
