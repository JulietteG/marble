Chill on the hollow ponds
Set sail by a kid
In the heat wave that hit us all, 1976

I felt the percussion
The green man had gone
Half my road was now a motorway, 1991

I was by the Black Sea
Two hours in time
[?] the urges and the new school bell, 1979

Changed into lakeside
In January (hollow ponds)
Modern life was sprayed onto a wall in 1993

Where the horses and passing trains
Have been tangled [?]
In the green woods where you walked with me
Ship on hollow ponds was filled
Up with the dreams we shared on our CDs
Every moment now and everyday
Every moment now and everyday---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
