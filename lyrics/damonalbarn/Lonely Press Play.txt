Arrhythmia 
Accepting that you live with uncertainty 
If you're lonely press play 

Di lady Di 
The aspects that you pass on while travelling 
When you're lonely press play 

'Cause you're not resolved in your heart 
You're waiting for me 
To improve 
Right here 
When I'm lonely I press play 

Swimming in blue 
After new year into the mirror she flew 
When I'm lonely I press play 

Can I get any closer 
What antidote can I bring to you 
When I'm lonely I press play 

'Cause your not resolved in your heart 
You're waiting for me 
To improve 
Right here 
When I'm lonely I press play 

Arrhythmia 
Accepting that you live with uncertainty 
If you're lonely press play 

Can I get any closer 
What antidote can I bring to you 
When I'm lonely I press play---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
