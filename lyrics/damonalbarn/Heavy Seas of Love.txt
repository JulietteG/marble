When your soul isnt right
And its raw to the night
Its in your hands
When the traces of dark come
To fade in the light
Youre in safe hands

Heavy seas of love
Radiance is in you
As above so below
On the heavy seas of love

Heavy seas of love
We come together in you
Counting out the new moons
On the heavy seas of love

When the world is to tall
You can jump you wont fall
Youre in safe hands
What the day will now give
How those seeds will now live
Its in your hands

Heavy seeds of love
Radiance is in you
As above so below
On the heavy seas of love

Heavy seas of love
We come together in you
As above so below
On the heavy seas of love

Heavy seeds of love
Radiance is in you
As above so below
On the heavy seas of love

Heavy seas of love
We come together in you
As above so below
As above so below
On the heavy seas of love---
