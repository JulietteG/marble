Love made freedom
So is it better than freedom?
Love'll make your tongue roll up inside your mouth
It's louder than any sound
Well you make love
So are you better than love?
Was it love that made you take my heart and beat it out
Is love gonna save you now?

Are you still there, are you still there?
What does that matter anyhow?
Coz I'm still here, but your love ran out

Right when you think it's safe
Don't look away
Soon it'll hit you babe
You can't escape
You can runaway
But you won't get away
Coz you're a love killer, a love killer
Say what you want
But you'll never change
You'll never see it babe
Until it's too late
You can runaway
But you won't get away
Coz there's no love for a love killer

Love ends life
When you take love from a life
Love'll make your eyes roll back inside your face
Whenever it goes away

Are you still there, are you still there?
Are you starting to feel it now?
Coz I'm still here, and time's running out

Right when you think it's safe
Don't look away
Soon it'll hit you babe
You can't escape
You can runaway
But you won't get away
Coz you're a love killer, a love killer
Say what you want
But you'll never change
You'll never see it babe
Until it's too late
You can runaway
But you won't get away
Coz there's no love for a love killer

Are you still there, are you still there?
Are you starting to get it now
When you get here, I won't be around 

Right when you think it's safe
Don't look away
Soon it'll hit you babe
You can't escape
You can runaway
But you won't get away
Coz you're a love killer, a love killer
Say what you want
But you'll never change
You'll never see it babe
Until it's too late
You can runaway
But you won't get away
Coz there's no love for a love killer---Lyrics submitted by nyki.
