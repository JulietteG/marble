I didn't mean to do it
It was the easiest thing I ever have
I didn't want to hurt you
And it's the greatest thing that I regret
Coz I didn't try to make it right
I just let it happen before my eyes
And you still want me by your side
But I think I've gone too far this time

I will make you cry
I will break you down inside
Don't stay with me oh lover
Coz I will take you under
I will make you cry
I will hurt you inside
Don't stay with me oh lover
Coz I will take you under

Ohh, ohh

I loved you but I couldn't
Stop myself from falling in
Had everything I wanted
But it wasnt worth it in the end
Now I'm gonna try to make it right
Coz that's not who I am inside
And you still want me there with you
But there's so much I can't undo, undo

I will make you cry
I will break you down inside
Don't stay with me oh lover
Coz I will take you under
I will make you cry
I will hurt you inside
Don't stay with me oh lover, ohh

I'm gonna try, I'll find a way
To make it right, ohhh
You won't remember how I hurt you so
But you're the one who saved me
And I'll always know

And I will make you cry
I will break you down inside
Don't stay with me oh lover
Coz I will take you under
I will make you cry
I will hurt you inside
Don't stay with me oh lover
Coz I will take you under
Ohh, ohh
Don't stay with me oh lover
Coz I will take you under
I will make you cry
I will hurt you inside
Don't stay with me oh lover---Lyrics submitted by nyki.
