Don't go left, oh ho, be polite move to the right,
Doing the reactionary. 
Close your eyes to where you're bound, 
And you'll be found doing the reactionary!

All the best dictators do it
Millionaires keep steppin' to it
The four hundred love to sing it
Ford and Morgan swing it

Hand up high
And shake your head
You'll soon be red
Doing the reactionary---Lyrics submitted by Hatsu Narita.
