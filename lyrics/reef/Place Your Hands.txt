Oh, place your hands on my hope
Run your fingers through my soul, oh oh, yes
And the way that I feel right now
Oh Lord, it may go

So place your hands on my hope
Run your fingers through my soul, alright I say
Oh, and the way that we feel right now
Oh lord, it may go

Put your hands on, put your hands on, yeah
Put your hands on, put your hands on, yeah
Put your hands on, put your hands on, yeah
Put your hands on, put

You know you cannot hide from whats inside
You know you cannot hide from whats inside
So I ask of you to help me through
I ask of you this thing to do

Put your hands on, put your hands on
Put your hands on, put

So lay me down for a while
Join my body with my mind, alright now
Oh, and I cried at the common one
For weeks aft he died

Put your hands on, put your hands on
Put your hands on, put your hands on

Put your hands on, put your hands on
Put your hands on, put your hands on
Put your hands on, put your hands on
Put your hands on, put your hands on

'Cause the way that we feel right now
Oh Lord, it may go away

Put your hands on, put your hands on
Put your hands on, put your hands on
Put your hands on, put your hands on
Put your hands on, put your hands on---
