It's not enough, it's not enough, it never was or will be
 I never had a chance to thank you for ripping out my heart
 It's not enough, it's not enough, it never was or will be
 I never got the chance to say fuck you

I don't want to be your tourniquet for minor lacerations
 Don't wanna be your Romeo 'cause you're no goddamn Juliet
 You always did know just what to say
 Insult to injury, you just love to hate me

It's not enough, it's not enough, it never was or will be
 I never had a chance to thank you for ripping out my heart
 It's not enough, it's not enough, it never was or will be
 I never got the chance to say fuck you

You've got a gun, I've got a gun, let's write a tragic ending
 Don't wanna be this way again, don't wanna be the one to blame
 You can have the high roads, I'll take the roads
 Disguise the frailty, I just love to hate you

It's not enough, it's not enough, it never was or will be
 I never had a chance to thank you for ripping out my heart
 It's not enough, it's not enough, it never was or will be
 I never got the chance to say fuck you

It's not enough, it's not enough, it never was or will be
 I never had a chance to thank you for ripping out my heart
 It's not enough, it's not enough, it never was or will be
 I never got the chance to say fuck you---Lyrics submitted by cyko.
