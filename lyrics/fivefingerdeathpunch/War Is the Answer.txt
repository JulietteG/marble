This ain't a test.
Fuck the rest.
Trying to set the record straight.
Talking shit behind my back.
I dare you to say it to my face!
I've heard the words roll out your lips you little trample fucking bitch!

The time has come,
to get you some
'cause i just do not give shit!

Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
See to me you're just a cancer.
Motherfucker!
War is the answer!

As of now the end begins.
I want to laugh but there's no joke.
To eat with the beast and run with the wolves,
on the ashes you must choke.
I know it's got to chap your ass to think that i just won't go away!
Well vex me not,
i'm writing you off.
I've got nothin' more to say!

Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
See to me you're just a cancer.
Motherfucker!
War is the answer!

(Do you want to disrespect me you little fuckin' punk?
Everything I've done to be who i am, as far as I've fuckin' come?
I'll slap you so fuckin' hard it'll feel like you kissed a freight train.
Fuck you.)

Do you take me for a fool?
How's it feel to be a tool?
Talking shit behind my back
See to me you're just a cancer.
The time has come to get you some.
Motherfucker!
War is the answer!---Lyrics submitted by Calvin.
