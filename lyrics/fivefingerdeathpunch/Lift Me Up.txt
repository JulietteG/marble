It ain't no mystery
I'm all I have left
I'm pushing back and running you over

I've been thrown down run around
Beaten till I hit the ground
Telling you right now that its over

There's no room for mistakes
All the cards are in place
Say what you will but say it to my face

Better back the fuck up
Better shut the fuck up
I'll do what I want and I'll never give up

I wont be broken
I wont be tortured
I wont be beaten down
I have the answers
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up

I'm gonna change history
Enlighten the world
Teach them how to see through my eyes

I'm gonna lash back check that
Treat it as a heart attack
Stomp out all the ugliest lies

You can't convince me to change
We get on the same page
I've had my fill now there's nothing but rage

Best get out of my way
Cause theres nothing to say
Is that all that you got
Because I ain't got all day

I wont be broken
I wont be tortured
I wont be beaten down
I have the answers
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up

I wont be broken
I wont be tortured
I wont be beaten down
I have the answers
I take the pressure
I turn it all around

Lift me up above this
The flames and the ashes
Lift me up and help me to fly away
Lift me up above this
The broken the empty
Lift me up and help me to fly away

Lift me up to fly away
Lift me up to fly away
Lift me up---Lyrics submitted by scottie emry.
