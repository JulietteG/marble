I'm leaving behind this world
And all the things I am
I'm tearing away from it
Because I know I can
I'm pushing away from you
And all the things you are
Don't need the memory
Already wear the scars
There is no yesterday
Tomorrow's far away
I gave you everything
And in return
You gave me nothing
Show me a sign
Please give me anything
I will not hide from what's inside of me
My nemesis
I'm turning away from me
And all the things I've known
I don't need your help no more
I can do this on my own
I'm taking all the blame
Resent what I've become
I regret everything and
There's nowhere left to run
There is no yesterday
Tomorrow's far away
I gave you everything
And in return
You gave me nothing
Show me a sign
Please give me anything
I will not hide from what's inside of me
My nemesis
I gave you everything
And in return
You gave me nothing
Show me a sign
Please give me anything
I will not hide from what's inside of me
My nemesis---
