You want it you got it
Every thing you needed and more
You said it i heard it
Careful what you wish for
Deleted, defeated, everything you've ever been
No mercy its the way of the fist

Strapped with rage
Got no patience for victims
Sick and tired of the whole fucking world

I don't remember asking you about your imperfections
You might win one battle
But know this I'll win the fucking war

Step to me, step to me motha fucka
Zip your lip, you've run out of time
Step to me, step to me mother fucker
Talk the talk now walk the damn line

Deserve it, you earned it
Got yourself a fuck'n war
Believe it, you need it
Face down, on the fuck'n floor
I hate it!! cant take it
Wanna break your fuck'n bones
No mercy, you fagot
Should have left it all alone

Strapped with rage
Got no patience for victims
Sick and tired of your whole fucking world

I don't remember asking you, about your imperfections
You might win one battle
But know this I'll win the fucking war
As you crash and burn

1, 2, Fuck you

Step to me, step to me mother fucker
Zip your lip, you've run out of time
Step to me, step to me mother fucker
Talked the talk, now walk the damn line
Step to me, step to me mother fucker
Shut your face, it's your turn to die
Step to me, step to me anybody
Talk the shit, your ass is mine

I don't remember asking you about your imperfections
You might win one battle
But know this
I'll win the fucking war---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
