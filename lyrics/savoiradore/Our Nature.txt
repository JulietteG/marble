Mother, no one ever told me
Buried underneath the cemetery
The gates her name was calling
Don't believe the stories growing

Standing, balanced in the wake of
Silence, swimming in the particle light
We breathe, we hear them calling
Do we follow roses falling

Finally fell in to the sun
You are the one
And who am I to run
When this is done

Can you separate the past life
In me, marking the day I die
The child of wild cities
Born again, the faiths forgive me

My eyes, mirrors of a thousand
Pieces, breaking the fall skyline
Design of higher knowing
Now a vessel guiding going

Finally fell in to the sun
You are the one
And who am I to run
When this is done---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
