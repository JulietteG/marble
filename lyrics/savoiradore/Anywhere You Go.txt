I know that you're somewhere else
I've seen you when you're by yourself
Your eyes are careless, drifting all around
As I watch, never making a sound

Won't you let me come with you
Wherever you'll be headed to, when you do

Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
I'm with, I'm with
Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
I will, I will

Did you picture yourself alone
When you ran away from home
I know you're restless but you won't have to wait for me
Cause I'll be permanently ready

Won't you let me come with you
Wherever you'll be headed to, when you do

Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
I'm with, I'm with
Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
I will, I will

Won't you let me come with you
Wherever you'll be headed to, when you do
I'll be even so
I'll go with you when you do

Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
I'm with, I'm with
Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
Anywhere you go, anywhere you go
I will, I will---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
