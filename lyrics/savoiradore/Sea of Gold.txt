I want what I cannot have
I have all that I should want

One tomorrow three today
Storing everything away
Where is all my family?
I still need them here with me

Who are you now?
I'm living in a sea of gold
Who are you now?
I'm living in a sea of gold

Maybe my father was right
Always picked the wrong fight
Now I'm too far in the cave
For anyone else to save

Who are you now?
I'm living in a sea of gold
Who are you now?
I'm living in a sea of gold---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
