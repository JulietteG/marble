A cloud of dirt around your feet
Making way through foreign ground
With the heat the only law that you've found

Wild Davie, sing it baby
With the lightning you'll be riding

You've got a house upon your back
And your one eye open wide
To protect traces of good that you find

Wild Davie, sing it baby
With the lightning you'll be riding

You'll get in over your head
When you can't do this alone
But till that day you'll keep on keeping on, on your own

Wild Davie, sing it baby
With the lightning you'll be riding---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
