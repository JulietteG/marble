Down by the river he found me
I was a little girl he found me
The trees were all in bloom around us
Soft leaves were hugging all of me when they found us

Started slow, kept it low
So that I'd be the only one to know
What he meant when he said:
"You are the loveliest creature that I ever did see.
You are the loveliest creature that I ever did see.
I'll keep you with me, oh I'll keep you with me."

The sun was sitting down beside us
There was no one around to find us
The water held my feet beneath me
He put his hand up to my face and he held me

A touch of skin to begin
How we'd learn to let each other in
In his way he would say:
"You are the loveliest creature that I ever did see.
You are the loveliest creature that I ever did see.
I'll keep you with me, oh I'll keep you with me."

We came together, we came together
Under the blue, under the blue
We came together, we came together
Under the blue, under the blue

You are the loveliest creature that I ever did see.
You are the loveliest creature that I ever did see.
You are the loveliest creature that I ever did see.
You are the loveliest creature that I ever did see.---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
