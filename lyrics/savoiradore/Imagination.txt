Locked away for a hundred years
Painted over to hide the fear

Don't run away from the burning reverie
Strange lies around the sea, surrounding you and me

You came in with a heavenly glow
It's such a shame I want everyone to know
The secrets that we're keeping
And all the love we're leaving 
Up to the imagination

Can you believe there's a city in the sky
The one that keeps cancerers alive

Down with the sun hiding hands from feral eyes
It's just begun to break, hold on until it dies

You came in with a heavenly glow
It's such a shame I want everyone to know
The secrets that we're keeping
And all the love we're leaving 
Up to the imagination

Only in the morning
We'll be left alone
Only in the morning
We'll be left alone

You came in with a heavenly glow
It's such a shame I want everyone to know
That you came in with a heavenly glow
It's such a shame, such a shame
The secrets that we're keeping
And all the love we're leaving 
Up to the imagination, the imagination
The secrets that we're keeping
And all the love we're leaving 
Up to the imagination, the imagination---Lyrics submitted by Bora Bosna.
