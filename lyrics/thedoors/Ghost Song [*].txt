Awake...

Shake dreams from your hair my pretty child,
my sweet one chose the day
and chose the sign of your day,
the day's divinity...

First thing you see...

A vast radiant beach and a cool jeweled moon...

Couples naked race down by its quite side,
and we laugh like soft,mad children
smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy...

The music and voices are all around us...

Choose they coon, the ancient ones,
the time has come again choose now,
they croon beneath the moon beside the ancient lake...

Enter again the sweet forest,
enter the hot dream,come with us,
everything is broken up and dances...

Indians scattered,
on dawn's highway bleeding,
ghosts crowd the young child's,
fragile eggshell mind...

We have assembled inside,
this ancient and insane theater,
to propagate our lust for life,
and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets...

The barns have stormed the windows kept,
and only one of all the rest to dance and save us,
from the divine mockery of words,
music inflames temperaments...

Oooh,great creator of being,
grant us one more hour,
to perform our art and perfect our lives..

We need great golden copulations...

When the true king murderers 
are allowed to roam free,
a thousand magicians arise in the land...

Where are the feast we are promised???---Lyrics submitted by chryssa pap.
