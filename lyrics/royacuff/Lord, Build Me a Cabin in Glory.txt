Build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland,
In the shade of the tree of life that it may ever stand,
Where I can hear the angels sing and shake Jesus' hand,
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland.

Many years i've been lookin' for a place to call home,
But I failed here to find it so I must travel on,
Don't care for fine mansions on earth's sinkin' sand,
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland.

Build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland,
In the shade of the tree of life that it may ever stand,
Where I can hear the angels sing and shake Jesus' hand,
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland.

They're many dear loved ones who've gone on the way,
That great final morning will i hear them say,
Come join in our singing and play in our band,
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland.

Build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland,
In the shade of the tree of life that it may ever stand,
Where I can hear the angels sing and shake Jesus' hand,
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland.

Not askin' dear saviour to live in thy bliss,
For I feel I'm not worthy to receive all of this,
I'm prayin' dear saviour from thy blessed hand,
For just a little cabin in the corner of gloryland.

Build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland,
In the shade of the tree of life that it may ever stand,
Where I can hear the angels sing and shake Jesus' hand,
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland.---Lyrics submitted by Jud.
