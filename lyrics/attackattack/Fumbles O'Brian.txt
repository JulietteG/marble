Attack Attack, we back again baby
Haha, fresh out that jankety baby
Hey yo man, it's that new joint baby

There is only one thing that can fill my chest
As I go through the options they are useless
Looking for a reason
And something to live for
Everything seems to fall short

Oh, my love, you need to just keep breathing
let your heart beat slowly.

Oh my love, I was never meant to fill your cup
and oh I can't fulfill you forever
Cause I'm not your knight in shining armor
The one that you might call for everything

There is only one thing that can still my fear
As I look for the meaning, you are still here
There can only be one God
There can only be one God

Shorty, you're on my mind yeah
Shorty, all of the time yeah
Shorty, you're on my mind yeah
Shorty, all of the time yeah

Oh my love, I was never meant to fill your cup
and oh I can't fulfill you forever
Cause I'm not your knight in shining armor
Or the one that you might call for everything---Lyrics submitted by janae.
