Open your eyes, and we confront the misery
Listen to what I say, just latch onto the words forever
Who are you fighting for?
Who are you fighting for?
And now I've got to find a simple escape

All I need, all I need is a simple escape
Can't you see my mind as it struggles to be sane
An escape from everything, oh
It finally changes on the inside, oh

Why do we forget, all the things that don't matter?
Listen to what I say, just latch onto the words forever
What are we fighting for?
What are we fighting for?
And now I've got to find a simple escape

All I need, all I need is a simple escape
Can't you see my mind as it struggles to be sane
An escape from everything, oh
It finally changes on the inside, oh

Don't hold your breath for the things that you seek
It will all burn to the ground with everything
We're all looking for our freedom
From the things we want to run from.

All I need, all I need is a simple escape
Can't you see my mind as it struggles to be sane
An escape from everything, oh
It finally changes on the inside, oh
Open your eyes!---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
