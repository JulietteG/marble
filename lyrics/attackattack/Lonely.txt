My heart doesnt pull me the same.
All my carelessness is gone
And you know my mind doesnt hole me the same
and girl my sorrow goes on and on.
My soul wants to pull me away
And all this hopelessness has won
And all these dreams wanna take me away,
but this feeling just makes me stay.
Apathy...Has its hold on me

Lonely, I feel so lonely, woah oh oh, lonely wont you just hold me.
Lonely, I feel so lonely, woah oh oh, lonely wont you just hold me

And its taken me 7 days
to realize that my time is gone.
and i never knew that i was gonna be the one to blame.
Why has this taken me so long?
Girl, you know I dont want to be alone.
You know ill never find another one 
Girl, you know I dont want to be alone.

Apathy has its hold on me
Lonely, I feel so lonely, woah oh oh, 
Lonely, wont you just hold me.
Lonely, I feel so lonely, woah oh oh. 
Lonely, wont you just hold me.
Lonely, I feel so lonely.
Lonely, wont you just go away.
All these thoughts try and pull me down
My soul will go on.
All these thoughts try and pull me down
My soul will go on.
Lonely, I feel so lonely, woah oh oh, 
Lonely, wont you just go away.
Just hold me.
Lonely, I feel so lonely
I feel so lonely.
Wont you just hold me.
And hold me.
Lonely, I feel so lonely
My soul will go on.
Lonely, I feel so lonely
My soul will go on.---Lyrics submitted by Tristen.
