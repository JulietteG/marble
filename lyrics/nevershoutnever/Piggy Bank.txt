(1, 2, 1, 2, yeah!)

A poor man would kill for the bank,
But a rich man would die for it.
If that's the case,
When I'm runnin' this race.
It's the last place I waste time.

'Cause see, time is money and money breaks hearts
But you can buy yourself a new girlfriend.
She'll be a cold heart woman with a greedy eye
Waitin' for your old ass to die.

I'm so happy here with you 'cause you're my type of girl.
You never cared about my empty piggy bank,
Or the things that we could never do.
Uh-huh.

So give to the poor and pray for the rich,
'Cause you never know when your heart's gonna quit.

If you're working for a paycheck, you better cash in,
'Cause life's to short to never have lived.

And I'm so happy here with you 'cause you're my type of girl.
You never cared about my empty piggy bank,
Or the things that we could never do.
Uh-huh.

See, I've been working my whole life,
Tryin' to prove the pissy people wrong.
That you can earn an honest living with an old guitar
And a couple old-fashioned songs.

I'm so happy here with you 'cause you're my type of girl.
You never cared about my empty piggy bank,
Or the things that we could never do.
Uh-huh.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
