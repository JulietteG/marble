A poor man would kill for the bank
And a rich man would die for it.
If thats the case when ima runnin this race
Its the last place i'll waste time.
You see time is money,
and money breaks hearts.
but you can buy yourself a new girlfriend.
she'll be a cold hearted woman with a greedy eye.
waitin for your old ass to die!

Im so happy here with you.
Cause your my type of girl.
You never cared about my empty piggy bank.
Or the things we could never do!
uh huh.

So give to the poor.
And pray for the rich.
Cause you never know when your hearts gonna quit!
If your workin for a paycheck.
You better cash in.
Cause lifes to short.
To never have lived.

Im so happy here with you.
Cause your my type of girl.
You never cared about my empty piggy bank.
Or the things we could never do!
uh huh.

See i've been workin my whole life.
Tryin to prove the pissy people wrong.
That you can earn an honest livin with an old guitar.
and a couple old fashion songs!

Im so happy here with you.
Cause your my type of girl.
You never cared about my empty piggy bank.
Or the things we could never do!
uh huh.---Lyrics submitted by Avery.
