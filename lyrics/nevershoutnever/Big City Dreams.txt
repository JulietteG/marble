You say we're both little people and you like it that way
But in time I'm gunna put this body to shame [and grow old]
Where a suit like my old man
Pack up all my things and get my ass out of town

We've got it good
Whether you like this town or not
I know it's small but with a big head
it's bound to get hot
In the summer
But the summer is a bummer
If you can't leave
This pathetic excuse for a town

That holds all your memories
A lifetime of crushes and your broken dreams
To be anywhere but here
But baby anywhere is away from me

[Woooh]
If you got it all figured out
Then what is there to shout about
This midwest town is gonna miss you
[Ooooh]
Just go ahead and work it out
But first come on and let it out
Scream it shout tell everbody that your gonna leave

In about one year you'll have it all figured out
These big city dream are what you're about
Walking like stangers among these states
Only time will tell how long I can wait

We've got it good
Whether you like this town or not
I know it's small but with a big head
it's bound to get hot
In the summer
But the summer is a bummer
If you can't leave
This pathetic excuse for a town

That holds all your memories
A lifetime of crushes and your broken dreams
To be anywhere but here
But baby anywhere is away from me

[Woooh]
If you got it all figured out
Then what is there to shout about
This midwest town is gonna miss you
[Ooooh]
Just go ahead and work it out
But first come on and let it out
Scream it shout tell everbody that your gonna leave

Me again, oh so casually 
Did you take the hit for me or the home team

[Woooh]
If you got it all figured out
Then what is there to shout about
This midwest town is gonna miss you---Lyrics submitted by Mandylyn.
