And if I was a sailor
I'd sail the seven seas
To tell you "baby I don't want you to leave"
You see this world is such a sad place
And without your pretty face
I'm sure it's gonna wind up much worse

And I know that you'll see someday that I can't live without you
And I know what I say is true cause I'm so stuck on you girl

I'm in love from the first time I let my eyes on you
i sure do do do do ohh 
There's nothing I can do
And I'm in love from the first time I let my lips on yours
Now you're walking out my door
And there's nothing I can do

And if I could explore the world
I'd bring you along
We'd go from New York to Timbuktu
But truly I am sad right here at Denny's
Drinking coffee and sharing a cigarette

And I know that you'll see someday that I can't live without you
And I know what I say is true cause I'm so stuck on you girl

I'm in love from the first time I let my eyes on you
i sure do do do do ohh 
There's nothing I can do
And I'm in love from the first time I let my lips on yours
Now you're walking out my door
And there's nothing I can do

I'm in love with you ---Lyrics submitted by Valerie.
