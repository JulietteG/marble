My shadow followed when you walked away
and ever since that day
my life has never been the same
my freinds  all ask just why you went away and 
all that I can say
Is your heart was in another place
and all I know is when
I move away
my heart will stay in this midwestern state

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Darling your with him
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Damn, it's such a shame
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's driving me insane and ever since you went away,
my heart has never beat the same
and all that I can do
is Just laugh

California waits for me to make the change
so I can start a band
and party like it's over
My friends all ask just why I want to change and all that I can say is
It's all because of her!
And all I know
Is when I move away
my heart will stay in this midwestern state

Woah-oh-ho-ho-oh
Darling your with him
Woah -oh-oh-oh-oh
Damn, it's such a shame
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's driving me insane
and ever since you went away,
my heart has never beat the same,
and all I want to do is just go scream it in your face
(everybody!)

Woah-oh-oh-oh-ho
Darling your with him
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Damn, it's such a shame
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's driving me insane and ever since you went away,
my heart has never beat the same
and all that I can do
is just laugh                                                                       (:---Lyrics submitted by McKenna.
