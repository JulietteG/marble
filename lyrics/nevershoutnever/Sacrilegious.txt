Sunday morning, wake up early
Skip church service to find my Jesus
I know it sounds so sacrilegious
But I just don't belong in a place like that
I love the cause but not the act

'Cuz Jesus was a friend and not a judge
He loved the sinners as much as he loved the little ones
That man was love and not an act

And I sing hallelujah, hallelujah
I'm set free

Sunday morning, wake up early
Skip churh service to find true meaning 
I know it sounds so disappointing
But I just don't belong in a place like that
I'll love the cause but not the act

And I song hallelujah, (x3) hallelujah 
I'm set free
