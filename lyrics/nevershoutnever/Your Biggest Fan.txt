I'm a real big fan of yours.
But i'm quite the joke to you.
But girl it wasn't a joke,
When you kissed me in your room,
and replied i love you too.
I'm a little bit insecure
From all of these mistreatments.
But see i'm working it out.
But working it out,
is so damn hard when your alone.
Sha da da da da da da 
da da da 
da da da da da da da da da

I am running out of words,
to say to you,
wondering why i'm a wasting my time.
Thinking back an wondering,
why i'm such a fool
for loving  you.

And i get to the point where, 
all i wanted was for us 
to make up.
But it's not that easy.
Cause girl you move on so quickly,
keeping a boy like me,
at the edge of his set.
And i know everything you do,
is all about your perfect image.
Well i hope this song,
it helps your image ha.
Sha da da da da da da
da da da
da da da i'm so over you now.

I am running out of words
to say to you.
Wondering why i'm a wasting my time.
Thinking back and wondering why,
I'm such a fool
for loving you.

And i was the one who,
thought i was strong.
Well you proved  me wrong
Now i'm singing along,
to every song on the radio,
I don't wanna go
Come on baby tell me something i wanna know
And i don't wanna say what is on my mind!
Because slack of motivation,
is taking over my time.
And i'm sick of trying.
All together now!

And i am  running out of words
to say to you 
wondering why i am wasting my time.
Thinking back and wondering why 
i'm such a fool
for loving you.---Lyrics submitted by jasmine.
