I know that i've been dancing around the truth woah
Tell me what the hell I'm suppose to do
And I, I'm a little bit agitated
with a slight scent of denial

(please dont call)
I'm calling all the time I know I interupt
But it hurts when I all I hear is you hang up
And la da da da da da da
I wont try that again

(me again)
I'm calling all the time I know I interupt
But it hurts when I all I hear is you hang up
And la da da da da da da
I wont try that again

La la la la (x6)

Everybody's going to the party 
and were having a good time
And I'm feeling alright tonight
With a better judgment

Everybody's going to the party 
and were having a good time
And I'm feeling alright tonight
With a better judgment

Everybody's going to the party 
and were having a good time
And I'm feeling alright tonight
With a better judgment
A better judgment 

(please dont call)
(me again)
I'm calling all the time I know I interupt
But it hurts when I all I hear is you hang up
And la da da da da da da
I wont try that again---Lyrics submitted by Mandylyn.
