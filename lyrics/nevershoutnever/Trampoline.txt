Girl, I've been thinkin' a lot about who we could've been,
If I was back home, just chillin', with you and all my friends.
But dear, I'm gone.
And that's the lousy truth.

For the past three years I swear I've been a better man.
And who I've become
I know, I know, I know I'll let you down.
But I've been gone, 
for too damn long.

So if you go away right now then I can guarantee 
that I wont break your heart.
But if you go and stay then baby,
I will hope and pray that you will run away.
Cause dear, it breaks my heart 
to see you here.

So shine outward, not inward.
You've been a selfish little girl.
For the past three years, I've been through,
more than you could know.
And God I don't want you to know.
What I have been through 'cause you just 
wouldn't understand.

You're just a girl with, some issues,
as bad as it may sound. 
But you're the girl, 
Who's been drivin' me mad.

So if you go away right now then I can guarantee 
that I wont break your heart.
But if you go and stay then baby,
I will hope and pray that you will run away.
Cause dear, it breaks my heart 
to see you here.

So go to school in Chicago, 
find a new boy, 
a new life,
a whole new set of friends.
'Cause all that I will ever do is break your heart
and dear it breaks my heart, 
to see you here.
Dear it breaks my heart, to see you here.

Just so you know,
I've been thinkin' a lot about who we could've been
If I was back home, 
Just chillin, with you and all my friends.

But dear I'm gone,
and that's the lousy truth.---Lyrics submitted by kaylin.
