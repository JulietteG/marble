dear i wrote you a song
despite the fact, you did me wrong
and dear i dont know what the hell is going on with you
but something aint right.

you tell me that you love me
then you go and leave me
why you do this to me baby
im love, sick
i just cant sleep just cant eat
cant do much of any thing, at all
cause im sick and in love with you, dear.

and dear i wrote you a song
in hopes that you would sing along
and dear ive been working my ass off for you
cause something aint right

you tell me that you love me 
then you go and leave me
why you do this to me baby
im love, sick
i just cant eat just cant sleep 
cant do much of any thing at all
cause im sick and in love with you, dear.---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
