Yeah you sure broke my heart last week when you said you had slept with him
I know you called, I got them all.
la da da da da da 
girl you better love what you got, before you go and give it all away
but don't say that that I don't know you
'cause oh, I know all about your type,
you're the type of girl that texts all day and talks all night
and oh, I know that you are feeling sad, I don't feel bad 
'cause even after 3 text messages, 4 missed calls you still
slept with my best friend.

Yeah you sure got a lot of nerve 
to say that this was all my fault.
I know you called, I got them all
la da da da da da 
girl you better love what you got, before you go and give it all away
but don't say that that I don't know you
'cause oh, I know all about your type
you're the type of girl that texts all day and talks all night
and oh, I know that you are feeling sad, I don't feel bad
'cause even after 3 text messages, 4 missed calls you still
slept with my best friend.

So I sing
rain rain go away come again another day
when I say it's ok to give a little hell to pay
and every single time you make your way into my sheets
the hours move to minutes but the days turn to weeks
and I know it's so co-ol, but I must be a fo-ol for taking you in
and letting in control of my heart.
and every single time you make your way into my sheets
the hours move to minutes but the days turn to weeks

Rain rain go away come again another day
when I say it's okay to give a little hell to pay
and every single time you make your way into my sheets
the hours move to minutes but the days turn to weeks
and I know it's so co-ol, but I must be a fo-ol for taking you in
and letting in control of my heart.
and every single time you make your way into my sheets
the hours move to minutes but the days turn to weeks

Oh, I know all about your type
you're the type of girl that texts all day and talks all night
and oh, I know that you are feeling sad, I don't feel bad
'cause even after 3 text messages, 4 missed calls you still
slept with my best friend.---Lyrics submitted by olivia.
