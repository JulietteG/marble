Jane Doe, 
I dont think I know you
But I know for sure
That you are beautiful 
So baby let me know
Your name
Damn whats her name?

Cause Im overly attracted 
And Im terribly convinced
That she could be my princess 
And I could be her prince
And I felt that way since
Since I saw Jane Doe

Jane doe,
I dont think I know you
But I know for sure
That I could get to know you
If you let me know 
your name
Damn whats her name?

Cause Im overly attracted 
And terribly convinced
That she could be my princess 
And I could be her prince
And I felt that way since,
Since I saw Jane Doe

Shes everything I want and more
Shes everything I want for sure
Shes everything that I want to adore
Well baby I,

Am overly attracted 
And terribly convinced 
That she could be my lover
But I think I lost my chance
You had me at first glance
Oh my Jane Doe ---Lyrics submitted by Sydney.
