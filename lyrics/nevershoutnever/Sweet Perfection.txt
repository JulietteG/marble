Last night was a thirller,
was a killer,
was a damn good time.
I met a pretty girl and I wanted to make her mine.
So I took her for a walk and damn that girl could talk.
We talked about all the pretty things,
and all the shitty things,
and all the little things that fall... between.

And oh, pretty girl,
I know that I just met you,
but I might just dare to say,
that I love you.
And oh, sweet perfection,
won't you hear my one confession?
I've been lost.
But dear, I'm found.

I've been lookin' for a girl that's just like you.
You got words to say but no point to prove.
You got me, and that's enough for you.
And girl, I got you.
I've been lookin' for a heart that's so complete.
So satisfied with the little things.
I got you, and that's enough for me.
So girl, can't you see
that you and me
could be so free
and live happy?
So, take my hand, and let's run.

And oh, pretty girl,
I know that I just met you,
but I might just dare to say,
that I love you.
And oh, sweet perfection,
won't you hear my one confession?
I've been lost.
But dear, I'm found.
Dear I'm found.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
