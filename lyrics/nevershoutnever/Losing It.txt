All we ever did was move around
I was always the new kid
never the cool kid

All I ever wanted to do
was to fall in love
just to be in love

but my heart was racing
my mind was screaming
you've got your whole life
to do these things

but my legs were shaking
my hands were searching for her
in the backseat of my car
I just lost it.

And I can't believe it.

I knew I was only sixteen
but I thought I loved her.
and it'd last forever.

But only if I knew
that she wasn't true
how could she do this to me

My heart was racing
my mind was screaming
you've got your whole life
to do these things

but my legs were shaking
my hands were searching for her
in the backseat of my car
I just lost it.

And I can't believe it.
