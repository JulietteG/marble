You say were both little people and you like that way
But  in time Im gonna put this body to shame and grow old
And wear a suit like my old man 
Pack up all my things and get my ass out of town.

We got it good,
whether you like this town or not
I know its small but with a big head its bound to get hot
In the summer but the summer is a bummer
If you cant leave this pathetic excuse for a town

Where it holds all your memories 
A life time of crushes and your broken dreams
To be anywhere but here,
But baby anywhere is away for me 

and yoooo
If you got it all figured out
Then what is there to shout about?
This midwest town is gonna miss you


Just go ahead and work it out
But first come on and let it out
Scream and shout and tell everybody that your gonna leave

In about one year you"ll have it all figured out
These big city dreams
and what your about
walking like strangers among these states
Only time will tell how long I can wait

We got it good,
whether you like this town or not
I know its small but with a big head its bound to get hot
In the summer but the summer is a bummer
If you cant leave this pathetic excuse for a town

Where it holds all your memories 
A life time of crushes and your broken dreams
To be anywhere but here,
But baby anywhere is away for me 

and yoooo
If you got it all figured out
Then what is there to shout about?
This midwest town is gonna miss you


Just go ahead and work it out
But first come on and let it out
Scream and shout and tell everybody that your gonna leave

Leave again, oh so casually
Would you take the hit for me
or the home team

And whoooo
If you got it all figured out
Then what is there to shout about?
This midwest town is gonna miss you
