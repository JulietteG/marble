Sherri, you smell different
Get up early in the bed -- for you morning comes so easy
Spells have been cast and the urge has been lost
Snipers posted bills -- as they should -- of our midnight vacation
Back on the planet now -- Im beginning to see just how
Echelon your dreams and they'll come true
Type slowly

One of us is a cigar stand --
And one of us is a lovely blue incandescent guillotine
The edge of creation is blurred and blushed
Not a lot of room to grow inside this leather terrarium
People of the bay -- it is excruciatingly gray
Face the front when he comes for you
Type slowly

Cherish your memorized weakness
Fashioned from a manifesto -- lady, I am no futurist
Im my only critic, i

Trolls in the glen are consorting again
The liberals say they don't exist but I know that they do
Reinforce your literal ass -- hit it on the first or second pass
Frozen images, respected few
Type slowly---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
