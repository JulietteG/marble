(CHORUS)
Heres what it looks like (Looks like)
Being the best
What it looks like 
To be a cut above the rest

(VERSE 1)
Nobody understands what it takes to be the man
Having every single person say you cant when you can
To give up everything youve ever known for a dream
And never stop the fight no matter how hard it seems

You sacrifice, you bleed, you sweat, and you cry
Doing everything you can not to lay down and die
When you fall and you call out; theres no one to help
So youve got no other option but to pick up yourself

At the end of the battle youre the only one standing
Everyone watching, the stage youre commanding
The pages of history will speak of today
And when they talk about the champion
This is what theyll say:

(CHORUS)

(VERSE 2)
People will break you right down to nothing if you let em
Theyll say, Theres a million others like you, what makes you better?
But remember that these folks are afraid of the unknown
Theyre the ones who wet the bed if they go 10 miles from home

Stay Down! 
Is what they scream in your ear
The only weapon that they have to use is fear
So you take all the beatings and you take all the hits,
But your back on your feet for more, you dont quit

Youll never back down, never stop, never pause
Never give up, never sacrifice the cause
This is your life, you gonna let somebody take it? 
Look in the mirror: Thats all you need to make it 

(BRIDGE)
The smoke has all cleared, and you own the thrown
Youre king of the castle, and everybody knows
They bow in your presence, and fear your might
Cause they know for damn sure what it, what it---Lyrics submitted by A W.
