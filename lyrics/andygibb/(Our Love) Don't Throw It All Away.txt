Maybe I don't want to know the reason why
but lately you don't talk to me
And darling I can't see me in you eyes
I want you near but your so far away
but let your love flow back to me
I can't believe I let this feeling die
(you were the only)
you were the only living thing that keeps me alive
and tomorrow (tomorrow) If I am here without your love
you know I can't survive
only my love can raise you high above it all

(chorus)Don't throw it all away our love, our love don't throw it all away
Repeat

We can take the darkness make it full of light
but let your love flow back to me
I can't believe I let this feeling die
(Happy room) this happy room would be a lonely place
when you were gone
And i won't even have your shoulder for the crying on
no other womens' love could be this true
I am begging you

(Chorus)
(Chorus)

We changed the world, we made it ours to hold
the dreams are made for those who really try
quess losing you is real
but I still feel you here inside
(Chorus)
