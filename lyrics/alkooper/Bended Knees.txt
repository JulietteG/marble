PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME NOW
Im speakin to you from the heart
Even though I treat ya bad & make ya cry sometimes
You must believe in my better part

PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME NOW
Though it seems Ive shut you out
There are things buried deep inside of me
That we must take the time to talk about

I don't know why I treat you so bad
But youre my girl and theres no two ways about it
I don't know why Im so mean to you
But I don't think theres anything that I can do about it

You are me on your terms and I am yours on mine
Don't ya think that we should really stay together
To be apart is such a waste of time
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME NOW
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME NOW---Lyrics submitted by geneva.
