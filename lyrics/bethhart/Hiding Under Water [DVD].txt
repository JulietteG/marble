Heaven don't want me
Heaven don't fool me
No one will understand
And it's alright
I'm feelin' these changes
Everybody is strangers
No one will lend a hand
And I guess that's life

You say, you got a feelin'
You figured out, the writing on the wall
And angels on the ceiling
Don't calm you, when you call
You found your own religion
And searched your heart, for somethin' more
Stood naked in the kitchen
Tryin' to wipe yourself off, of the floor

No, I won't take you for granted
These broken arms, can hold you
No, I won't take you for granted

You say, it don't matter
You're livin' life, and livin' long
And hear the phony laughter
Echoing on and on
I'm hiding under water
I pray to God, wash me away
Can't hear the child's wonder
The innocence got hushed, along the way 
And you say, now you say now

No, I won't take you for granted
These broken arms, can hold you
No, I won't take you for granted

No, I won't leave you abandoned
This broken heart can love you still
No, I won't take you for granted

You don't say, you will 
But inside I know
You don't say, that it hurts
And tonight killed slow
All the love, in the world
Won't let you let go - let you, let go

Hold on, your soul will rise again
I know that it will
Hold on, your soul will rise again
I said that it will
Hold on, your soul will rise again
I know that it will now

Heaven don't want me
Heaven don't fool me
No one could give a damn
And i guess that's life
You say you got a...feeling.---
