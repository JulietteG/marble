I guess youre late but wasnt invited
To get out your way I did everything
But Ive been falling in love with you every day

It wasnt easy, I know
Some of those nights have probably seemed impossible
Ive been falling in love with you every day

If its unknown, so concern
I turn back around
Im climbing on the walls that Ive built
To keep you out
And all the bridges you, you tried to burn
Al fallen down
Its you and me now

Next to you I want to lye
Im your shoulder when I need to cry
Im so happy that you came
To ease the darkness and ease the pain
Ive been falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
Falling in love with you

Falling in love
Falling in love with you every day

Ive been falling in love with you every day---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
