Got a lot to learn chile 
If you want to burn 
Seeking hearts concerns chile 
If you want her chile 
Here's your fire, gonna fry her 

Will you let me in 
I will come again 
Screamed temptation 

Got a lot to learn chile 
Seeking hearts concerns chile 
If you want to burn 
Here's your fire 
If you wanna hurt chile 

Gonna fry her 
Will you let me in 
I will come again 
I will come again 
Got a lot to learn chile 

So many sold concerns chile 
It's much too late to turn 
If you want her chile 
You're on fire, gonna fry her 

I will come again 
Will you let me in 

What'll you say 
What'll you do, what'll you do 
When she starts weeping 
When she crows 
Walking by temptation cries 

I am thee and 
I will be here again 
I will come again---
