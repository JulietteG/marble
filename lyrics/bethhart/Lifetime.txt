She got a lover's soul, she lost her radio 
She got her memories, her extremities 
She's drivin' much too fast, she wants to make it last 
She wrote a song for you, she calls it black and blue 

It aint no way, to live a lifetime 
Aint no way, to live at all 
Aint no way, to live a lifetime 
It just aint no way darling, to live at all 

She's sick of being late, she knows she's second rate 
She wonders if you'll stay, and love her anyway 
She's crawling back again, it's such a bitter end 
She knows she don't belong, she screams a children's song 

And it aint no way, to live a lifetime 
Aint no way, to live at all 
Aint no way, to live a lifetime 
It just aint no way darling, to live at all 

And the sun don't shine my way 
And the moon don't make me dance 
If you're listening, hear me pray 
I'd give my hands, for just a second chance 
My plea is not in vain 

She lost her lover's soul, she lost her radio 
She got her memories, her extremities 
Just let that bad man go, she's sweating in the snow 
No one to call her own, don't call the truth ain't home 

And it aint no way, to live a lifetime 
Aint no way, to live at all 
Aint no way, to live a lifetime 
It just aint no way darling, to live at all 

It just aint no way, to live at all 

All alone, all alone...---
