Oh father, come together 
my sisters and all my brothers 
apathy, getting crazy 
help me understand 
there's water there's fire 
which one should I aspire 
compassion or reaction 
what will command 
(reach out and hold me 
or reach out and bite my hand) 

chorus: 
I'm like a one-eyed chicken and a two-legged dog 
Shrinking heads in the kitchen then I piss on the lawn 
I'm not the kind of woman that you want to take home 
Only heaven knows the devil's pain 
I just can't change 

I'm diggin diggin diggin diggin on you 
diggin diggin diggin diggin on me 
We're diggin diggin diggin diggin are we 
What we gonna do? 

Oh father, make it better 
make my love shine bigger than ever 
tell Jesus, Never leave us, this is my prayer 
there's kindness, there's cruelty 
a little bit of both inside of me 
Come love me Come heal me 
make me aware 
(reach out and hold me-or reach out and bite my hand) 

(chorus) repeat 

so glad you made it 
or I'd be nothing at all 
I'm tired and faded 
I'm like a wreckin' Ball 

(chorus) repeat
