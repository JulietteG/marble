She remembers the day they met
Right down to the minute
Yeah, sitting alone in the dark
Her life was never the same
Staring into the rain
Her life was never (never) the same

She cries
Its a mystery 
Ain't nobody seen
How much this is hurting me
It's black magic
It's the season of the Witch
Blame the Moon, oh oh
Blame the Moon, oh oh
Blame the Moon
Blame the Moon
Yeah, it's a mystery

How much this is hurting me

Ain't nobody seen
Its the season of the Witch
Its black magic
Blame, blame, blame, blame
Blame the Moon, oh oh
Blame the Moon
Blame the Moon, oh oh
Blame the Moon,
I said blame the moon
Blame the Moon, oh oh
Blame the moon, oh oh
Blame, blame

Blame the Moon---
