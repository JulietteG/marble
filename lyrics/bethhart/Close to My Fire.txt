(with Joe Bonamassa)

Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and flames getting higher
You light me up, sweet old desire
So wont you come close to my fire?

Baby, its cold when youre gone
Dont make me wait, wait too long
Whenever youre near I have all this feeling
Youre melting me down
Oh, Im a believer

Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and flames getting higher
You light me up, sweet old desire
So wont you come close to my fire?

Boy you are my symptom delusion
Youre melting me down, my resolution
I can escape, cant say Im trying
You say my name , oh I cant hide it
So come on, shoot down
Dont smoke it down
You cant stop craving til you come around
I cant deny it, Im right here at home
My fever is waiting
Oh you know I want ya

Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and flames getting higher
You light me up, sweet old desire
So wont you come close to my fire?

Close to my fire

Aint no need to tell me why
Aint no need to tell me why
Because you know I want you to

Strike a match and set me on fire
Watch it burn and flames getting higher
You light me up
Oh yea yea yea, You light me up
Oh come on, You light me up!
Close to my fire
Come come come come close to my fire ---
