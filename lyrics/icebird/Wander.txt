long as i live

holding my breath as long as i could stand
gotta admit: i'm scared to death to even stand so close to you
but there's a bright side to all of this
(i left it around here somewhere)
heard there's a bright side after all, i swear

breathe (slowly)
though you may wonder
though you may wander
don't ever wander in these woods alone

long as you live
long as the bright sun shines
i'll try to resist
merchant of death
be advised: we'll always be opposed to you

but there's a bright side to all of this
(that's what i was told)
heard there's a bright side after all, i swear

breathe (slowly)
though you may wonder
though you may wander
don't ever wander in these woods alone---Lyrics submitted by son little.
