So I'm sitting on the couch holding the remote
Flipping channels, I'm a rebel 
Eating a bowl of them Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
How gangsta is that? Not gangsta at all?
Aw you judging me, dogg? Please, you shop at the mall
Me, I shop at boutiques, limited quantity sneaks
Where do these quantities be? Maybe they all on my feet
But I don't get it tho, about a year ago you said my gear is wack
Nigga now my gear is dope, I guess it goes full circle like a Cheerio
'Cause you rocking what I was rocking like a year ago!
You said my chain was lame then you go and get a rope
You clown jokesters pose for poser posters
Told you when I woke up, hold it like holsters
And stop while I fold the rest of my clothes up
Love the hypocrites hating until you make it
Wack swagga jackers but my styles ain't for the taking

Nigga, you still playing Sega?
I'm cooler than that guy.
No red monkeys with the bapesters?
I'm cooler tan that guy.
What you riding on that bike for?
I'm cooler than that guy.
Does that belt say Star Wars?
I'm cooler than that guy.
Why your jeans ain't sagging?
I'm cooler than that guy.
You ain't smokin on the dro, cuz?
I'm cooler than that guy.
Where your stunna shades at, dog?
I'm cooler than that guy.
Man y'all niggas ain't got no buzz!
I'm cooler than those guys.

I'm in the crib Saturday night with my Sega, that's right
Playing a game of that Street Fighter, Street Fighter, Street Fighter
I guess that makes you think you cooler then me
But any girl you can pull, I can pull em with ease
Like the letter after D not ecstacy, It's easy to me
Yes yes indeed
It's hard to believe but swallow it
So much game that I could put it in a bottle and sell it to lames
And getting graphics in ya fade was fresh in the day
But it was jacked by the losers I'm bout to say screw it and
Grow a jerry curl, wear a diaper like Cupid or something else stupid
And see if people do it and if they do it, then that proves it
People are just losers and they'll do anything if someone cool do it
But they won't do it first so I guess they not cool
And it's the end of the verse so I'm chucking that deuce

Nigga, you still playing Sega?
I'm cooler than that guy.
No red monkeys with the bapesters?
I'm cooler tan that guy.
What you riding on that bike for?
I'm cooler than that guy.
Does that belt say Star Wars?
I'm cooler than that guy.
Why your jeans ain't sagging?
I'm cooler than that guy.
You ain't smokin on the dro, cuz?
I'm cooler than that guy.
Where your stunna shades at, dog?
I'm cooler than that guy.
Man y'all niggas ain't got no buzz!
I'm cooler than those guys. ---Lyrics submitted by destiny.
