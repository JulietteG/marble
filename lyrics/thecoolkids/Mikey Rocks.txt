[Chorus:]
I-I I'm Mikey
I-I-I rock
I-I- I'm Mikey
I-I- I rock

[Verse 1:]
Check it.
Hold the phone like a call on the other line
I'm on the phone with a bone of another kind
So hold on we could roll to the other side
Side of my dome is the zone you could never find
Grip hand you might need assistance
Try to find where you are inside of my head
Stay in line single file if you can
Then, we can kick it like kickstands and,
You know I peddle to the chainslip
So fly propellers propel us to the angels
Re-pellin the fellas that's jealous of the name
It's Repellin to rappers as soon as I stage hit
So one two one two mike check
I'm out for hot in e.q. my steps
I don't use bad grammar so please excuse this
I'm just tryin to let niggas know who I is

[Chorus:]
I-I I'm Mikey
I-I-I rock
I-I- I'm Mikey
I-I- I run
I-I- I rock
I-I- I'm Mikey
I-I- I run

[Verse 2:]
Mission complete for all those who don't know
Sienara to afros and old flows
The concept of rockin shows is so old
Just keep 'em off the wall like vans logos
Pull it together the spare change and hobos
Cause if you got change in your pocket
Then instantly the dames start flockin'
And if you'll show me to the stage
I rock.
Yea
Yes that song request, all I need is a mic and Inglish
Drop the beat all right I proceed to spit
Me and the beat start fightin with the snares and kicks
Now it's a riot on the track
Reason why is cause I'm fire and I'm hired to do that
And ii'm fire cause I'm liver then tha wire that was tired
Bought back from tha dead
Let it rest on ya head.
(if you don't kno who he is, it's...)

[Chorus: til fade]
I-I I'm Mikey
I-I-I rock
I-I- I'm Mikey
I-I- I run
I-I- I rock
I-I- I'm Mikey
I-I- I run---Lyrics submitted by kyshawndre.
