(feat. P!nk & John Legend)

J.L.:
In this proud land, we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose

P.:
Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not beaten, yet
Don't give up
I know you can make it good

J.L.:
Though I saw it all around
Never thought I could be affected
Thought that we'd be the last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

P.:
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We don't need much of anything, no
Don't give up
'Cause somewhere there's a place where we belong

Rest your head
You worry too much
It's gonna be alright

Both:
When times get rough
You can fall back on us

P.:
Don't give up
Oh, please, please, don't give up

J.L.:
Got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
Gonna stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below

Both:
Whatever may come
And whatever may go
That river's flowing
Ooh, that river's flowing

J.L.:
Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no one needs

P.:
Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not the only one
Don't give up
No reason to be ashamed
Don't give up
You still have us

J.L.:
Mm, don't give up

P.:
Don't give up now
We're proud of who you are
Don't give up
You know it's never been easy
Don't give up
No matter what you do
Don't give up
'Cause I believe there's a place
There's a place where we belong

Don't give up ---
