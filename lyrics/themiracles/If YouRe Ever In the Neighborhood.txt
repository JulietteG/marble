Love you came to us,
When we were on our own,
You had a seat at our wedding,
And you shared our home,
You sat down at the table,
Shared a cup of wine,
You kept us together love,
And helped us pass the time.

If you're ever in the neighborhood,
Woo hoo ooo,
Ever, ever, ever in the neighborhood,
Stop by, say hello, have a cup,
If you're ever in the neighborhood,
Love be sure to look us up.

Sure do miss you now.

When the babies came,
They knew your name,
Your song was in the air,
But then we got too busy,
To know that you were there,
Love we didn't mean it,
Did we make you leave,
It's not that we broke up,
You know you're what we need.

If you're ever in the neighborhood,
Woo hoo ooo
Ever, ever in the neighborhood,
Stop by, say hello, have a cup,
If you're ever in the neighborhood,
Love be sure to look us up.

Sure do miss you now.
If you're ever in the neighborhood,
Love be sure to look us up.---Lyrics submitted by D Lee Moore.
