I had to leave you in Galway
but i think about you every day
in the morning and in the afternoon
I wish that i could see you soon

and when i heard you i felt so fine
it was like there was
nothing left on my mind
it was like Rockaway Beach in the month of June
I wish that i could see you soon

I have no plans to meet you babe,
I had a million things to do babe,
But it hit my heart with a harpoon,
I wish that i could see you soon
-- The angels go
How long do you can't see her?
And i'm like - the sooner the better
do you really think she'll wait for you?
Well i have no way to say and there's nothing i can do
Well i have no way to say and there's nothing i can do

-- go!

(not i see?)

Now that i'm across the sea i wonder if
you're gonna wait for me
or if you're gonna find
a new boy to spoon
I wish that i could see you soon

And if you
wait a little my pretty friend
until I come back to hold your hand
would be like bugs when they break through the cocoon
you know
I wish that i could see you soon

It has been a while
since i felt like this
and now i've found someone i really miss
under the sun
under the moon
I wish that i could see you soon
-- Angels!
How long do you can't see her
And i'm like - the sooner the better
do you really think she'll wait for you?
And i'm like
there's no way to say and there's nothing i can do
And there's no way to say and there's nothing i can do
-- go!

(...)

How long do you can't see her
And i'm like, well, the sooner the better
do you really think she'll wait for you?
And i'm like
there's no way to say and there's nothing i can do
And there's no way to say and there's nothing i can do
And there's no way to say and there's nothing i can do
no way to say and there's nothing i can do
