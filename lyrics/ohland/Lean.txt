did you really carry me when i was asleep? 
did you try to defend me when i was weak? 
did you pick up me up that lonely night when the lights died out and i turned to the grace? 
did you carry me when i was asleep? 

now you're out on the bottomless sea so its time for you to lean on me. 
lean on me. 
now you're out on the bottomless sea so its time for you to lean on me. 

did you lie for me to keep me safe? 
did you bear with me when i misbehaved? 
far from here could you feel my fear when the lights died out and i turned to the grace? 
did you lie for me to keep me safe? 

now you're out on the bottomless sea so its time for you to lean on me. 
lean on me. 
now you're out on the bottomless sea so its time for you to lean on me. 
lean on me. 
ohh. 

words are falling down. 
frozen on the ground i'm trying to stop the light. 

now you're out on the bottomless sea so its time for you to lean on me. 
lean on me. 
now you're out on the bottomless sea so its time for you to lean on me. 
lean on me. 
ohh. 
lean on me. 
lean on me. 
lean on me. 
lean on me. 
ohh.---Lyrics submitted by rokin.
