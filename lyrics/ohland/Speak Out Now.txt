If I jump, will it echo?
From an infinite space
Does it light, bring the thunder
Run away you're still at risk
Be my sins, I'm your sorrow
If I shout, no earth will shake

We're running away
Pushing everything over the edge
We're running away
If I find out who's gonna catch
We're running away
Pushing everything over the edge
We're running away
(Falling over)

Watching it all over my shoulders
Until the masquerades over
We're not gonna wait here
Not gonna get left out
No one can tell you how
You just speak out now
Watching it all over my shoulders
Until the masquerades over
We're not gonna wait here
Not gonna get left out
No one can tell you how
You just speak out now

It is true, cause it's spoken
And there's no way to bring it back
Time is a thief, trying to trick you
It will happily tell you lies
Memories, whisper slow
Hold back, or let it go go

We're running away
Pushing everything over the edge
We're running away
If I find out who's gonna catch
We're running away
Pushing everything over the edge
We're running away
(Falling over)

Watching it all over my shoulders
Until the masquerades over
We're not gonna wait here
Not gonna get left out
No one can tell you how
You just speak out now
Watching it all over my shoulders
Until the masquerades over
We're not gonna wait here
Not gonna get left out
No one can tell you how
You just speak out now

When there's a win, there's a sacrifice
When there's a loss, there's a bright light
No stones or sticks kick us on the high
If there's a law, there's a way to fly

Watching it all over my shoulders
Until the masquerades over
We're not gonna wait here
Not gonna get left out
No one can tell you how
You just speak out now
Watching it all over my shoulders
Until the masquerades over
We're not gonna wait here
Not gonna get left out
No one can tell you how
You just speak out now---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
