I've got a boxer, he's living in my ears and he hits the drum 
Playing by ear 
I've got a boxer, he's living in my ears and he hits the drum 
Is that weird? 
My boxer, he's living in my ears and he hits the drum 
Does baby like weird? 

Man touch, throws an uppercut 
Man touch, throws an uppercut 
My boxer, he's got no memory 
He plays the same rhythm on repeat 
On repeat, on repeat 
He plays the same rhythm on repeat 

Man touch, throws an uppercut 
Man touch, throws an uppercut 
Jab jab, his leather gloves 
Silky smooth, knock me out 
Jab jab, rubber feet 
Tricking me, tripping over jello knees 

Man touch, throws an uppercut 
Man touch, throws an uppercut 
Man touch, throws an uppercut 
Does baby like weird? 
Does baby like weird? 
Does baby like weird? 
Does baby like weird? 

My boxer wraps his wrist so tight 
He won't tire in the fight, he will win the fight 
My boxer like a Duracell 
Below the belt 
Below the belt 

Man touch 
My boxer, my defense machine 
He snaps like this so don't mess with me 
Watch out! He'll take me to the finals 
I'm the film, he's the subtitles 
Do your chanting, do your dance 
Do you mind if we don't hold hands? 

Man touch, throws an uppercut 
Man touch, throws an uppercut 

I've got a boxer, he's living in my ears and he hits the drum 
Playing by ear 
I've got a boxer, he's living in my ears and he hits the drum 
Is that weird? 
My boxer keeps me sane, he needs me like I need his game 
He keeps me wide awake, he taps the rhythm in my veins 
My boxer keeps me sane, he needs me like I need his game 
He keeps me wide awake, he taps the rhythm in my veins
