Trapped in a prism
In a prism of light
Alone in the darkness
Darkness of white
We fell in love
Alone on a stage
In the reflective age

Entre la nuit, la nuit et laurore.
Entre le royaume, des vivants et des morts.

If this is heaven
I dont know what its for
If I cant find you there
I dont care

I thought I found a way to enter
Its just a Reflektor (Its just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
Its just a Reflektor (Its just a Reflektor)

The signals we send
Are deflected again
Were still connected
But are we even friends?

We fell in love when I was nineteen
And I was staring at a screen

Entre le nuit, le nuit et laurore.
Entre les voyants, les vivants et les morts.

If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
Cause youre my home???

I thought I found a way to enter
Its just a Reflektor (Its just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
Its just a Reflektor (Its just a Reflektor)

Its just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection

Will I see you on the other side?
We all got things to hide

Its just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection

Will I see you on the other side?
We all got things to hide

Alright, lets go back

Our song escapes
On neon silver discs
Our love is plastic
Well break it to bits

I want to break free
But will they break me?
Down, down, down
Dont mess around

I thought I found a way to enter
Its just a Reflektor (Its just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
Its just a Reflektor (Its just a Reflektor)

Thought you would bring me to the ressurector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (Its just a Reflektor)
Thought you would bring to me the ressurector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (Its just a Reflektor)
Thought you would bring to me the ressurector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (Its just a Reflektor)

Its a Reflektor
Its just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor

Will I see you on the other side?

Its just a Reflektor

Will I see you on the other side?
We all got things to hide

Its just a Reflektor

Will I see you on the other side?---
