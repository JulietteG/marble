In the suburbs, I
I learned to drive
And you told me I'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving

You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd fight in
In a suburban war
You put it down against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
Nobody down, the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

The kids won't be so hard
In my dreams we're still screaming
Running through the yard
And all the walls that they built in the 70s finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the 70s finally fall
It meant nothing at all
It meant nothing at all
It meant nothing

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling into the night

I just can't understand
How I want a daughter while I'm still young
I want to hold her hand
Show her some beauty
Before this damage is done
But if it's too much to ask
If it's too much to ask
Send me a son

Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting
It's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement
And into the grass
Cause it's already passed
It's already already passed

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

I'm moving past the feeling
I'm moving past the feeling

In my dreams we're still screaming
We're still screaming
We're still screaming---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
