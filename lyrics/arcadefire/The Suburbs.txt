In the suburbs I, I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys we're leaving

You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting
In a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

The kids want to be so hard
But in my dreams we're still screaming
And running through the yard
When all of the walls that they built in the 70's finally fall,
And all of the houses they built in the 70's finally fall--
Meant nothing at all?
Meant nothing at all,
It meant nothing

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
And into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young
I want to hold her hand,
And show her some beauty,
Before all this damage is done
But it it's too much to ask
If it's too much to ask
Then send me a son---Lyrics submitted by Aaron Swaffer.
