Abraham took Isaacs hand and led him to the lonesome hill.
While his daughter hid and watched,
She dare not breathe. She was so still.
Just as an angel cried for the slaughter,
Abrahams daughter raised her voice.
Then the angel asked her what her name was,
She said, I, have none.
Then he asked, How can this be?
My father never gave me one.
And when he saw her, raised for the slaughter,
Abrahams daughter raised her bow.
How darest you, child, defy your father?
You better let young Isaac go.---
