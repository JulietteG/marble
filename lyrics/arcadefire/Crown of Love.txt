They say it fades if you let it,
love was made to forget it,
I carved your name across my eyelids,
you pray for rain I pray for blindness.

If you still want me, please forgive me. 
the crown of love is fallen from me. 
because the spark is not within me.

I snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom.

The only thing that you keep changin'
is your name. My love keeps growin'
still the same. just like a cancer.
and you won't give me a straight answer!

If you still want me. please forgive me. 
the crown of love has fallen from me.
If you still want me please forgive me
because your hands are not upon me.

I shrugged them off before my mom walked in my
bedroom.

The pains of love, and they keep growin'
in my heart there's a flower growin'
on the grave of our old love.
since you gave me a straight answer.

If you still want me. please forgive me.
the crown of love is not upon me.
If you still want me. please forgive me.
'cause the spark is not within me
it's not within me. it's not within me.

You gotta be the one,
you gotta be the way,
your name is the only word that I can say.

You gotta be the one,
you gotta be the way,
your name is the only word. the only word 
that I can say!

Only one that I can say!---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
