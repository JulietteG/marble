Sing sweet and low a lullaby
Till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking
A cradle in Bethlehem

While wisemen follow through the dark
A star that beckons them
A mother tonight is rocking
A cradle in Bethlehem

A little child shall lead them
The prophets said of old
In storm and tempest heed them
Until the bell is tolled

Sing sweet and low a lullaby
Till angels say Amen
A mother tonight is rocking
A cradle in Bethlehem

A mother tonight is rocking
A cradle in Bethlehem---Lyrics submitted by blake.
