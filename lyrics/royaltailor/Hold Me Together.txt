Hello Mercy, I have been searching for You lately
Ive been wounded and from what I hear
You have the remedy
They told me You would be for me so now I need to know
Is this a love that can save me
Or say You will then dont
Will You stay with me when nobody is around
If this is real, then tell me now

(Chorus)
Can You hold me together
Can Your love reach down this far
Can You hold me together
Cause without You holding my heart
Im falling apart

Saying so long, been lost, been gone
Not sure what to pray
Its not easy but I know You see me
When I lose my way
I keep on floating not knowing if there is more for me
Dont want to sink beneath waves of negativity
Im going under, Im afraid that I might drown
If this is real, I need You now

Im feeling stronger
With You by my side And
I realize You are my hope
I need to know
Without You, Im falling apart
Falling apart---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
