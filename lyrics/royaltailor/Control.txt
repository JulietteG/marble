This world is ra ra
In a bad romance, going ga ga
You know were gettin played by the love game
And hypnotized by all the fame
But I believe we cant back down from the fight
Its not okay with me to just be silent
Wont be silent, silent

(Chorus)
No, we wont let them take control
We wont go with the flow
Weve got to stand together
Its all plastic and I cant be a fake
Its all static, every word that they say
We wont let them take control
Wont let them take control

Life is short, baby tik tok
Aint got no time for your blah blah (nah nah nah)
Cause girl we dont need your drug
No, no, we dont what youre calling love
Cause I believe that youre either yes or no
Youre hot or cold
No teenage dream could ever be worth your soul
Never worth your soul

Burn like a fire
Shine like a diamond
See a lash when I smile
Brighter than Kanyes
Comes to the heart
Gotta guard what we buyin
Cant you see they all got you tryin
To fall in love with your stereo
So they control what you think and everywhere you go
But greater is He who lives inside of we know
He wont lose fight
Thats right---Lyrics submitted by Alice.
