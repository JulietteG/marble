Yes you've been on my mind,
I been drifting for quite some time,
This life is paralyzing, this life is paralyzing 
Me, I can't see through the craze,
Truth has been lost in the haze, 
and I need someone to save me.


Truth's all I want, all I want is you
You're all I want, all I want
All I want..

Cause there's black
And there's white
And there's wrong 
And there's right
I can't go one more night
Without telling you
That I am sorry

For all the pain
That I've caused
I been gone for so long
Without telling you
That I am sorry

Can you hear me,
Please forgive me

I'm screaming through the noise
Please tell me you can hear my voice
I am so lost without you, I am so lost without you 
here, I need some clarity, need your spirt leading me
My vision's getting bury

Truth's all I want, all I want is you
You're all I want, all I want
All I want..

Cause there's black
And there's white
And there's wrong 
And there's right
I can't go one more night
Without telling you
That I am sorry

For all the pain
That I've caused
I been gone for so long
Without telling you
That I am sorry

Can you hear me,
Please forgive me

I been locked in this maze,
For so long
Show me the way, back home
Open my eyes
To see you

Truth's all I want, all I want is you
You're all I want, all I want
All I want..

Cause there's black
And there's white
And there's wrong 
And there's right
I can't go one more night
Without telling you
That I am sorry

For all the pain
That I've caused
I been gone for so long
Without telling you
That I am sorry

Can you hear me,
Please forgive me

You've been on my mind, 
I been drifting for quite some time and, 
This life is paralyzing, This life is paralyzing, 
me---Lyrics submitted by Brandon.
