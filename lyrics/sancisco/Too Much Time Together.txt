You don't know any of my friends
We're better without them
I'm trying to keep up with the latest trends
You pulled me up so quick that I got the bends
This must be love
You're the only one that I'm thinking of
People say that we don't need to rush
I don't care you're my friend's crush

We spent too much time together
I wanna be with you forever
But we need space
You should stay at your place

Hey look honey, I broke the mode
This is gonna be over soon
So many outfits, things you do
Loyd me like a menace too
Your touch use to be loving
Now it just feel smalling
Something change, no one's to blame
Try to work it out, oh I don't think you want to
So many things inside
So many dark secrets you don't want me to find
It doesn't help that---
