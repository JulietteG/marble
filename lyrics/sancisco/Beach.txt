Hello, hello
Ive been waiting watching you all night
I dont know why
In the morning ill be waking wishing i was right
Maybe sometime
In the evening ill take you out for dinner
And if i cant read your mind, cant read your mind
Well watch the sun go down
And then the moon come out
Play pictures with your hands
Ill chase you, im your biggest fan

Whos gonna get you now? whos gonna get you now?
Im so far away, so far away

My mind is black and blue
It keeps pictures of you
Now i know why
We moved away from here
To know the atmosphere
All i wanna be is in your company
I made a mixtape
With all the songs that you hate
Cant read your mind, i give up this time

Whos gonna get you now? whos gonna get you now?
Im so far away, so far away

I heard your voice today
But we last spoke in may
I still miss you
Yeah, youre a ghost at sea
Drifting peacefully
Youll never come back to me

Whos gonna get you now? whos gonna get you now?
Im so far away, so far away---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
