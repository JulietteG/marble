Why do the stars fall at night?
Well are you here?

I got your message last night
You didn't get mine 'cause you've been calling me for days


Why do you hold on so tight?
What do you fear?

I got your message last night
You didn't get mine 'cause you've been calling me for days

da da da da da da da da da 
da da da da da da da da da da da da
(x3)

I wouldn't have gone to dinner
If I knew that you'd agree with everything I say

I left a message last night
You haven't called back I've been calling you for days

I have my keys at the gate
My mind is made up to make a quick escape

I left a message last night
You haven't called back I've been calling you for days

doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
(x2)

I saw you at dinner last night
You were holding his hand I've been watching you for days

I thought I saw you last night
Get out of my life you've been stalking me for days

da da da da da da da da da
da da da da da da da da da da da da
