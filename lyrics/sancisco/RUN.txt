You got your lovely long hair
And deep sea eye
But nothing much on your mind
You're in it for a ride

You said that you only live once
You'll give anything a try
You promise me you tell the truth
Now I know that's a lie
A lie

Gave my heart to Isabella
She's bad news
But I'm no better
Gave my heart to Isabella
Now I wish I never met her

Not going to get all what you want
Baby, don't talk, talk
Don't talk
Not going to get all what you want
Baby, don't talk, talk
Don't talk

I got to take to you
Like you're my moment at the sea
My first trip back to you
Momentarily
You never, ever been the one
Chasing me
But you're just having fun
Girl, you got me on a run

Gave my heart to Isabella
She's bad news
But I'm no better
Gave my heart to Isabella
Now I wish I never have met her

Not going to get all what you want
Baby, don't talk, talk
Don't talk
Not going to get all what you want
Baby, don't talk, talk
Don't talk

I never knew
That you wanted me
That's what you said

Not going to get all what you want
Baby, don't talk, talk
Don't talk
Not going to get all what you want
Baby, don't talk, talk
Don't talk

Not going to get all what you want
Baby, don't talk, talk
Don't talk
Not going to get all what you want
Baby, don't talk, talk
Don't talk---
