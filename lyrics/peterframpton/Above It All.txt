Be near my heart
Know that I will always lead you close
Be free my bird
If you fly take me with you where you go
Heaven knows

It's me and you
Chasing sunshine until tomorrow
What will we do
If the sky cries and turns to sorrow
I see us picking up
the pieces when they fall
rising above it all

Long is the night
Like the thief comes sneakin' round our door
But it's alright
Come the dawn he won't come round here no more
Then like before

It's me and you
Chasing sunshine until tomorrow
What will we do
If the sky cries and turns to sorrow
I see us picking up
the pieces when they fall
rising above it all---Lyrics submitted by Pinky Dinky Doo.
