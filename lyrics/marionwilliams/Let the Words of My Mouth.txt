Let the words of my mouth
Let the words of my mouth
And the meditations of my heart
Be acceptable 
In thy sight 
Wilt thou teach me how to serve thee
Wilt thou teach me how to pray
Our Father 
Which art in heaven
Hallow'd be Thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us 
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For Thine is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory forever
And ever
Amen---Lyrics submitted by Delisten.
