"Mama Tried"
by Merle Haggard,  1968
Lyrics below as they appear in cover by The Seldom Scene, recorded 2007


The first thing I remember knowin',
Was a lonesome whistle blowin',
And a young one's dream of growin' up to ride;
On a freight train leavin' town,
Not knowin' where I'm bound,
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried.

One and only rebel child,
From a family, meek and mild:
My Mama seemed to know what lay in store.
An' 'spite all my Sunday learnin',
Toward the bad, I kept on turnin'.
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore.

An' I turned twenty one in prison doing life without parole.
No one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried.
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin's, I denied.
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried.

Dear old Daddy, rest his soul,
Left my Mom a heavy load,
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes.
Workin' hours without rest,
Wantin' me to have the best.
She tried to raise me right but I refused.

An' I turned twenty one in prison doing life without parole.
No one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried.
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleadin's, I denied.
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried.---Lyrics submitted by MinstrelPains.
