Some folks like steak and potatoes
An others like lettuce and tomatoes
When I go home my baby, she knows just what to do
She gives me good booty and bar-b-que

CHORUS:
Good booty and bar-b-que
(Come on!)
Good booty and bar-b-que
(Say it!)
Good booty and bar-b-que
(Hey, hey yeah!)
Good booty and bar-b-que

Some folks like salads and green leafy things
But Ill go round the corner for some real good chicken wings
When I go down there my baby, she knows just what to do
She gives me good booty and bar-b-que

CHORUS:
Good booty and bar-b-que
(Come on!)
Good booty and bar-b-que
(Say it!)
Good booty and bar-b-que
(Hey, hey yeah!)
Good booty and bar-b-que

(Two Minute Musical Interlude)

Some folks like expensive dinners from the sea
But Ill go down to the club because thats where the partys gonna be
When I go down there my baby, she knows just what to do
She gives me good booty and bar-b-que (Owwwwwww!)

CHORUS:
Good booty and bar-b-que
(Come on!)
Good booty and bar-b-que
(Say it!)
Good booty and bar-b-que
(Hey, hey yeah!)
Good booty and bar-b-que

(Musical Fade-Out)
