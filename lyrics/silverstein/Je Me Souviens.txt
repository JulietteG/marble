Dear Mother can you hear my footsteps?
Im so close, Im right there.
Im almost home, so unprepared
To notice yet ignore
How hard it is to be around you.
I've came clean, Im washed out.
I've flooded the engine, stranded myself.
This home, native land
They speak in words I cant understand.

So when Im standing on this street like I have a hundred times,
You dont even glance at me you just pass me by.

I remember your face, from the moment I first saw you I never looked away.
Ill never forget how you looked that Saturday when you told me
We could never be together, and I could never change.

Mother, Mother is it you whos calling?
Lights out, lay down,
Well sleep when were dead, that time is now.
But soft speak will drown out
How I cant do whats right around you.
Cold breeze, no coat,
Excuses used to take words from my throat.
False hope confirmed.
Deceits a language I cant hope to learn.

So when were standing on this street like we have a hundred times,
We will celebrate the years you stalled and couldn't decide.

I remember your face, from the moment I first saw you I never looked away.
Ill never forget how you looked that Saturday when you told me
We could never be together, and I could never change.

I used to believe that every person had a purpose
In this swirling ball of indecision that consumes us all.
I used to believe that every person had a person
They could always count on and not be scared of, one for everyone.

So when Im standing on this street like I have a hundred times,
Can I walk away and finally leave, finally leave all of this behind?

I remember your face, from the moment I first saw you I never looked away.
Ill never forget how you looked that Saturday when you told me
We could never be together, and I could never change.

I remember your face, from the moment I first saw you I never looked away.
Ill never forget how you looked that Saturday when you told me
We could never be together, and I could never change.---
