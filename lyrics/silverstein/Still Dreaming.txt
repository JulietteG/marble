2 a.m., I lie down deep in slumber.
Feelings are falling downward.
I want to forget.
Waking up, I hear the way your voice sounds.
My heart starts to pound, now...
To the rhythm of yours.
You're so angelic. Your words so symphonic.
Touch your lips to my soul, eat this sorrow away.
How am I so lucky, I found you?

Sometimes, I feel like I'm still dreaming.
It seems like everyday, you're always on my mind.
This is how we stay so connected, so connected
over space and time.

When we talk about all my old drama,
You look at me and wonder how I'm not insane.
Every week the days seem to get longer.
But you know our love gets stronger with every word we say.
Stronger every day.
You know I would do anything for you.

Sometimes, I feel like I'm still dreaming.
It seems like everyday, you're always on my mind.
This is how we stay so connected, so connected
over space and time.

If you are feeling down, you know I feel it, now.
We give each other strength to make it through the darkness.
You take me to a place I never want to leave.
I'm in my deepest dream, I don't ever want to wake up.
I'll fight till I die, I won't say goodbye, and I won't let this pass me by.

Sometimes, I feel like I'm still dreaming.
It seems like everyday, you're always on my mind.
This is how we stay so connected, so connected
over space and time.

Let's run away, run away, run away now.
Let's go away, go away to some place safe.
I want it all, now I want everything.

This is how we stay so connected, so connected
over space and time.---Lyrics submitted by morgan.
