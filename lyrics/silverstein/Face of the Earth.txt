They take our pictures as angels and kings.
Were all pretending were someone.
One percenters or stars to be, jewels of the Midwest.

Its always taken the best of me,
Locked it away and broke the key
To this house of stairs and misery
At the bottom displaced me.

Fake and make no hesitation.
Secretly hoping this will be the last time.
Break, despise our desperation.
Secretly wishing we fell off the face of the earth.
Off the face of the earth.

The ice is running through my veins.
I cant feel a thing.
Emotionless as I bring you down with me.
We both take advantage.

Fake and make no hesitation.
Secretly hoping this will be the last time.
Break, despise our desperation.
Secretly wishing we fell off the face of the earth.

In my dreams, brakes are failing as Im losing all my teeth.
I cant breathe, fingers stretching out and pointing at me.
In my dreams, Im falling even faster, dying in my sleep.

Fake and make no hesitation.
Secretly hoping this will be the last time.
Break, despise our desperation.
Secretly wishing we fell off the face of the earth.
Off the face of the earth.
Off the face of the earth.
(Make no hesitation)
We fell off the face of the earth.---
