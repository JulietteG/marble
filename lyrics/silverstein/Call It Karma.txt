Blame it on the weather
But i'm a mess
And this Februrary darkness
Has me hating everyone
And I know I need your comfort
But this drama makes me sick
And the longer I lay here 
I know it's harder to get up
without you

[chorus]
Lose another day here 
Lose another year here
I'm with you

Finally something out there
Thats making sense
And its just another trend 
Carefully hidden in your dress
And this cycles never ending
And fashions overdone
And the further that i run away
The further I come back
To shelter

[chorus]x2
Lose another day here
Lose another year here
I'm with you
You are the fire
of my apartment floor
16 stories 
I'd rather burn than fall
It isn't fate that took 
us all by storm
It's just a turn of a card

Goodbye old friend
Goodbye, Goodnight
I'll move on
You'll call it fate
I'll call it karma
We had our time
It was fun while it lasted
I'll look back (look back)
With honour and no regrets
I won't be mad
Won't feel bad
These memories (These memories) will never leave me
Don't be sad 
Cause life goes on(life goes on)
It's getting to late
Tomorrow(tomorrow) is here.---Lyrics submitted by kyle.
