Im running back to you,
keep running back to you.

This is where I lay,
Ive been drunk for seven days.
I couldnt tell the truth,
So I made up
Alibis to hide my dishonest life.

Wait, theres something I cant explain
So Im giving in again.
All these desert nights
They keep me running back to you.

The fever takes ahold
I never thought Id miss the cold.
This is how I know
That Im still able
To feel my own insides,
Breathe in and think twice.

Wait, theres something I cant explain
So Im giving in again.
All these desert nights
They keep me running back to you.

This isnt my first mistake
There are things that I cant undo.
But from this mess I'm in
Im always running back to you.

I cant stay here buried.
I cant go on
Living with these
Alibis to hide my dishonest life.
Please forgive me,
Theres no where else to hide.

Wait, theres something I cant explain
So Im giving in again.
All these desert nights
They keep me running back to you.

Wait, theres something I cant explain
So Im giving in again.
All these desert nights
They keep me running back to you.

This isnt my first mistake
There are things that I cant undo.
And from this mess I'm in
Im running back to you.---
