One, two, three, four!

I hear you choking on your words again,
the secrets in your throat.
And I really wish you'd say
what you're thinking.
We've been down this road
so many times before,
my stomach cannot take it.
I've been killing time ,
You've been crossing lines.
You say:

Get ready, get ready, get ready for this!
I'm taking out my dagger.
Just say it, just say it, just say it for me!
I'm holding it up to your throat.
Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready for this?
You don't wanna hear it.
Just say it, just say it, just say it again!
It will tear your soul apart again.

I'm leaving you out in the cold again,
I'll let you freeze to death.
I won't let you see the flames
just the chimney.
Where there's smoke, there's fire
but I'm such a good liar,
you can't read the signals.
And my lips are sealed
from saying words that deal
your shame.

Get ready, get ready, get ready for this!
I'm taking out my dagger.
Just say it, just say it, just say it for me!
I'm holding it up to your throat.
Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready for this?
You don't wanna hear it.
Just say it, just say it, just say it again!
It will tear your soul apart again.

Stick to your guns!
You've been betting it all on a long shot
since day one.
You gotta call a spade a spade.
There is no ace up your sleeve,
how can you believe you will win?

Get ready, get ready, get ready for this!
I'm taking out my dagger.
Just say it, just say it, just say it for me!
I'm holding it up to your throat.
Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready for this?
You don't wanna hear it.
Just say it, just say it, just say it again!
It will tear your soul apart again.
It will tear your soul apart
I will tear your soul apart
It will tear your soul apart
Tear your soul apart again.---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
