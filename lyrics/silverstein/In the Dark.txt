Tunnel your way in,
Itll spit you out.

I can hold it in its a godsend.
A heart like an hourglass on its end.
Does it matter if the love ever comes back?
Does it matter if the sun ever comes back up?

In the dark, in the dark,
When I close my eyes I see you somehow.
Ive never felt more alone
And it brings me down.

In the dark, in the dark,
When Ive left this town and nothing matters now,
Ive never felt more alone
God it brings me down.

(Dont try to fight it.)
Smiling like a fool, action I feign,
lungs pushing air like a hurricane.
Can I fake it for whole train ride back?
Can I make it til the sky starts turning black?

In the dark, in the dark,
When I close my eyes I see you somehow.
Ive never felt more alone
And it brings me down.

In the dark, in the dark,
When Ive left this town and nothing matters now,
Ive never felt more alone
God it brings me down.

I fell head first into Union Pool,
Never thought a night of joy would turn out so cruel.
Avoided tender trap never went inside,
But veins let out where avenues and streets collide.
If Im out dont wake me,
This is the only peace I get.
And if Im out dont wake me
Until the sun comes up again.
And as we leave we cross these bridges,
On bumpy roads that taunt me.
I know its temporary,
It'll call me back to haunt me.

In the dark, in the dark,
When I close my eyes I see you somehow.
Ive never felt more alone
God it brings me down.

In the dark, in the dark,
When Ive left this town and nothing matters now,
Ive never felt more alone
God it brings me down.---
