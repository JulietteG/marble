Throwing up at the thought of you two.
How could you do this? My best friend with my bride,
Now you tell me you are leaving.

They'll see the fire in the dark night sky,
I hope you're home when I arrive.
And if theirs a pyre in the afterlife,
I'll be there again to light the match.

Burn! Gasoline, fire, it's the perfect combination.
Light it up. Burn it down. Breathe in my addiction.

They'll see the fire in the dark night sky,
I hope you're home when I arrive.
And if theirs a pyre in the afterlife,
I'll be there again to light the match.

"I am the light that warms up your body, that sets free the demons inside.
I am the one that that never ignores you, that never will let you down."

They'll suspect but they'll never prove that I was there.
In my veins, I feel the rush of adrenaline.
It's so hard to run away when I want to stay,
To watch it burn, watch it turn into dust.

"I am the light that warms up your body, that sets free the demons inside.
I am the one that that never ignores you, that never will let you down."---Lyrics submitted by Tanner.
