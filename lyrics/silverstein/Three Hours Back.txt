Let's go! 

Indifference grows, indifference feeds on me. 
A sickness fills the pathways where I breathe. 
Miles away from where I want to be, want to be. 

One day, you will see nothing is this simple, this simple. 
One day, you will see it takes its toll on me, toll on me.

Hey, lie awake and wait out all those days 'til I finally come home 
chasted, jaded, everything that I hate. 
I'll be there. 

Trading in my youth for broken wings as I slowly watch you walk away, so walk away. 
Will you stay? Will you stay? Will you walk away? 

Fall asleep to flashing screens and papercuts! Yeah! 
Waking up with vacant eyes and broken hearts again! 

One day, you will see (one day, you will see) nothing is this simple, this simple. 
One day, you will see (one day, you will see) it takes its toll on me, toll on me. 

Hey, lie awake and wait out all those days 'til I finally come home 
chasted, jaded, everything that I hate. 
I'll be there.---Lyrics submitted by Not.
