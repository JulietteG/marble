I've always been your favorite game
And all the world's your spot lit stage
I'm just another extra in your play - the fool

(Turn on, tune in)
I'm ready for your drama
(Tape up, weigh in)
You're throwing every hook tonight
Your charismatic lies make tears run down their cheeks
(Run down their cheeks)
I've lost the only thing I need
Here's to the plaintiff
And now you've taken her away

I've always been your favorite game
And all the world's your spot lit stage
Just another extra in your play, your fool

(Pull out the pin)
I'm falling on the grenade now
(Don't shoot, don't shoot)
I'm just a kid like you
We fight for billionaires who bomb our city streets
(Armed to the teeth)
Divide the youth for corporate greed
Here's to the propaganda
And now they take your life away

I've always been your favorite game
And all the world's your spot lit stage
Just another extra in your play
[x2]

And now that war has been declared,
How long until bombs burst in air?
We've come too far
Just to let this die, to throw this away

I've always been your favorite game
And all the world's your sparkling stage
Just another extra in your play
[x2] 

(We're not the world)
In your play
(We're not the world)
In your play - the fool
(We are not the world)---Lyrics submitted by natalie.
