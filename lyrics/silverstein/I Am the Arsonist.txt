(Yeah)

Verse 1:
Throwing up at the thought of you two.
How could you do this?
My best friend with my bride,
Now you tell me you are leaving.

Chorus:
They'll see your fire through the dark night sky,
I hope you're home when I arrive.
If there's a pyre in the afterlife,
I'll be there again to light the match.

(Burn)

Verse 2:
Gasoline. Fire.
It's the perfect combination.
Light it up. Burn it down.
Breathe in my addiction.

Chorus:
They'll see your fire through the dark night sky,
I hope you're home when I arrive.
If there's a pyre in the afterlife,
I'll be there again to light the match.

Bridge:
I am the light that warms up your body, that sets free the demons inside.
I am the one that never ignores you, that never will let you down.

Bridge 2:
They'll suspect, but they'll never prove I was there.
In my veins, I feel the rush of adrenaline.
It's so hard to run away, when I want to stay.
(I am the light that warms up your body, that sests free the demons inside.)
To watch it burn, watch it turn into dust.
(I am the one that never ignores you, that never will let you down.)---Lyrics submitted by Willis.
