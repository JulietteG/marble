Let's go!

Your life lives half a nation away,
my heart hurts so.
I believe letting you go was
the biggest mistake of my life.

What did I do?
Alone and confused.
What can I say?
What can I do?

I'm heading the wrong way home.
Knowing alone is alone.
It's just too difficult to be
just me instead of we.

What did I do?
Alone and confused.
What can I say?
Nothing.

I don't know where to begin
'cause you left me for him.
I don't know where to begin
since you left me for him.
I don't want to start again,
and I can't be your friend.
I don't know where to begin
now you left me for him.---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
