The drugs begin to peak
A smile of joy arrives in me
But sedation changes to panic and nausea
And breath starts to shorten
And heartbeats pound softer

You won't try to save me
You just want to hurt me
And leave me desperate

CHORUS:

You taught my heart,
A sense I never new I had.
I can't forget, the times that I was
Lost and depressed from the awful truth
How do you do it?
You're my heroine


You won't leave me alone
Chisel my heart out of stone
I give in everytime

(repeat CHORUS)

I bet you laugh
At the thought of me
Thinking for my self(my self)
I bet you believe(bet you believe)
That I'm better off
With you than someone else


Your face arrives again
All hope I had become surreal
But under your covers
More torture than pleasure
And ust pass your lips 
There's more anger than laughter
Not now or forever
Will I ever change you
I know that to go on
I'll break you my habit!

(repeat CHORUS)

I WILL SAVE MYSELF!---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
