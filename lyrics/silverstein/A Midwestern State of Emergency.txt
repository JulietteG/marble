I am a dead man, I'm crawling into a trap

A horizontal response
I'm laying down for you once again
You've taken what's granted
I've said goodbye to my friends
I throw myself headfirst into this
Close the curtain and strand me

Found myself lost again
With even more excuses and even less concern
Bound and gagged but I enjoy it
You seduce your prisoner before you take your turn

So lay me down in the field and put me under the trees
In the tall grass where they won't find me
Enjoying silence and peace until the sirens
They come back screaming, taking me away
I've given all I can give

So don't let me go back between Woodward and Cass
Cracked concrete and broken glass
This run down block with my name in lights
Your saving grace, my final rites
Eleven miles from where I was
When I conceded my head, embraced my lost control
Innocence in a state so pure
You hear the demons calling to take back what you stole

So lay me down in the field and put me under the trees
And the tall grass where they won't find me
Enjoying silence and peace until the sirens
They come back screaming, taking me away
I lost a piece of myself and I forget to slow down
And just breathe, and it's scaring me
I've given all I can give
So don't let me go

I am a dead man, I am a dead man
And it's the only way it can end
I don't know who's side I'm on anymore
And there's no starting over---
