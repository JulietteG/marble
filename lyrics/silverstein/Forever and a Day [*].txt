I thought we'd be together forever.
But it seems I was wrong and everything has fallen apart.
Think of what I've done for you.
Think of all that we've been through.
I hope every time he breaks your heart
you think of me and how I was to you.
Everything has fallen apart.
Everything.
One day you'll see just how good I was.(2)
And I thought that we'd be ..
And I thought that we'd be together forever.
And I thought that we'd be..
And I thought that we'd be..

[Spoken: (the poem "Where The Sidewalk Ends" by Shel Silverstein)]
There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in the peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
To the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
The place where the sidewalk ends.---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
