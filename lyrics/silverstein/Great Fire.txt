Burning down
We can't stop it
We gotta get out
Start again
The memories are gone forever

Don't try
To turn this around on me
I'm the one that saved you
This was my home
This was my life
It's not always just about you

And as I heard
The sirens begin to chime
I can feel my heart begin to race

I can see through the flames
That the fire cleanses me
Mind and soul now the same
And my body guides the way

I threw you over my shoulder
With the angel
On my other
I'm not your hero
I'll never be
What you wanted
What you thought I would be

I can see through the flames
That the fire cleanses me
Mind and soul now the same
And my body guides the way

I can see through my tired eyes
My sickness controls me
Deep inside I know trust (I know trust)
Is the mother of deceit
(Is the mother of deceit)

And there you were
Six years old, ashes in your hair
You're not scared
You've seen so much pain in so few years
As the world
Becomes a place where no one wants to stay
We remain
Silent until it's too late

And as I see
The planes take over the sky
I can feel it coming to the end

I can see through the flames
That the fire cleanses me
Mind and soul now the same
And my body guides the way (and you're burning)

I can see through my tired eyes (down my life so slowly)
My sickness controls me (I know in my heart)
Deep inside I know trust (I know trust)
Is the mother of deceit
(Is the mother of, is the mother of deceit)---Lyrics submitted by David.
