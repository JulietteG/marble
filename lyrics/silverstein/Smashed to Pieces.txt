Never Again. 
I'll slit my throat with the knife I pulled out of my spine. 
Maybe when you find out that I'm dead, 
you'll realize what you did to me.

[Chorus]
And if my lungs still let me breathe, 
would you be there for me. 
If I can make myself believe, 
I'll give you back what you took away.

No, I won't let it go. 
Douse myself in gasoline. 
So don't save me when you come into the fire. 
I'd rather die than have to see your smile.

[Chorus]
And if my lungs still let me breathe, 
would you be there for me. 
If I can make myself believe, 
I'll give you back what you took away.

You made me swear [x2]. 

I, I can't sleep. 
Realize all these things that you took from me. 
Smash my heart (you made me swear) 
into dust. (you made me swear) 
Suffocate my mind. (you made me swear)
Tear at me from inside. (you made me swear)
Smash apart what you created. 
How can i ever stop you from crushing my soul? 
It was, it was yours, yours to begin with.

[Chorus]
And if my lungs still let me breathe, 
would you be there for me. 
If I can make myself believe, 
I'll give you back what you took away.---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
