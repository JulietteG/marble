Hey!
I've lost everything.
Now I've gotta find a way out.

Hey!
They keep asking me where I was when it was burning
There's no trying to explain.
They'll lock me up again.
Throw away the key.

The protagonist became the villain they disdain in every way

Hey!
I've lost everything.
But I'm gonna find a way out.

Hey!
Nothing's left for me expect malady and hatred
No evidence was found
They'll let me go for now
At least 'til tomorrow

And Hey!
When tomorrow brings the morning sun again
I'll be long gone
Now
As I drive away and leave the past behind
I think I'm dying.

It's so pathetic
I hate you so much but I still miss you.
Karma is hard to change
When everything you do and say is awful
Remorse is hard to fake
When you only feel sorry for yourself

I'm coughing up more blood
It's filling up my lungs.
It's killing me.

Hey!
When tomorrow brings the morning sun again
I'll be long gone.
(I'll be long gone)
Dead!
Lying all alone on this motel room floor
I know I'm dying
(I know I'm dying)

Hey! (Hey!)
I've lost everything
Now! (Now!)
I've succumbed to grace
Hey! (Hey!)
It's not that surprising
A hero loses everyday---Lyrics submitted by Ine.
