Bitch, you aint gotta call my phone, 
Matta fact all you hoes can leave me alone, 
I just want my money, and now one you nappy head hoes gon' get non from me, 
Nigga, you aint gotta call my phone, 
Matta fact all you niggas can leave me alone, 
I just want my money, and now one of my fake xxx friends gon' get none from me,

I don't need no help my nigga, 
I can do bad on my own, 
And i don't need no company lil' momma even though i know you give great dome, 
I'd rather play my xbox 360 while smokin and sippin drank, 
I aint even gon' waste no gas gunna get some ass, i'm gon' keep my gas in my tank, 
Leave my money in my pocket i never leave it with hoes, 
Put a ring on my own finger cuz i sleep with z-ro, 
Homie i don't give a xxxx about what you drive or how much money you got, 
And i don't give a damn if ya'll like me or not, 
I see your lips movin but i can't hear nothin, cuz i'm not listenin, 
Hoe you only talkin to me because my teeth are glisenin and, 
Ya'll niggas be ridin thick so much ya'll need a dildo, 
That way when you think about z-ro you can shove it up your xxx real slow, 
Ima gangsta but ima man first and i tolerate no disrespect, 

Bitch, you aint gotta call my phone, 
Matta fact all you hoes can leave me alone, 
I just want my money, and now one you nappy head hoes gon' get non from me, 
Nigga, you aint gotta call my phone, 
Matta fact all you niggas can leave me alone, 
I just want my money, and now one of my fake xxx friends gon' get none from me,

I'm tryin to stay rich, xxxx a xxxxx (fuck a bitch)
I'd rather hit the studio and make anotha hit, (anotha hit)
Stop callin on my phone mayn i'm on some otha shit, 
Just leave a nigga lone, i aint the suckas you xxxxxx with, 
Cuz xxxxx you aint bout to get no dime, or no quality time, 
I'd rather be on my grind, smokin weed, writin rhymes, 
All you rappin xxx niggas callin me to get signed, 
Wantin me to rap for free, you done lost yo mind,---Lyrics submitted by darranique.
