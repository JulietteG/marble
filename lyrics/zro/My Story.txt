[Z-Ro]
I remember back in the day, living in the life when the world was so cold
Reminiscing about my first federal momma died when I was 6 years old
One deep in the game, feeling the pain beware 'cause I ain't right
Got a guerilla trippin' on everybody so me and my partnas ain't tight
I'm all alone in this here world of mine and I steady be feeling the stress
'Tho it's noting but a test I still be feeling like I'm not blessed
I can't run to my father cause he don't care, 1 deep in the world straight like that there
I might end up in the electric chair, I hope somebody got a nigga in they prayer
I'm fallin' off before my home invasion then I'm hawling off
I'm about that paper I won't stall if off, even if the law come I won't call it off
Z-Ro The Crooked and I'm living in sin, try to chase the paper by pimpen the pen
I said fuck the rappin' but I did it again, picking up a five point and I pimp it again
24 years old and I'm sleeping outside, dealing with the fact that screw just died
Runnin' around with my moterfucking brain fried
Anything is anything, on the cool I be ready to ride
So i be looking for death making a death wish, gone on and check a nigga of the checklist
I really need to get a peace of mind, fore i kick the bucket nigga my piece might still be restless

This is my story G
What a wonderful life, struggle and strive, my life
This is my story G
What a wonderful life, struggle and strive

[Z-Ro]
To many problems on my mind, living shife is starting to be a full time grind
I'm just trying to live my life, but somehow peace is something i'll never find
To many problems on my mind, living shife is starting to be a full time grind
I'm no trying to loose my life, but if I do i wanna meet Jesus Christ
Sometimes my mind be on another level, and I just can't take the pain
Wanna put a hot one in my brain, it's cold out there and I can't stand the rain
Sometimes my mind be on another level, and I just can't take the pain
Wanna put a hot one in my brain, it's cold out there and I can't stand the rain, maintain

[Z-Ro]
Pain what I feel in my brain, but I've gotta maintain
Struggling and I'm striving that a nigga be facing everyday is to much strain
Still I'm trying to stay on my game and I'ma mash for mine
Fellas be looking to get it so I'ma flash the 9
I'm sick of droppin' recored after record tape after tape
Another release wanna get the cash this time
I'm fixin' loose my mind, all of my rappin' raw dawgs they done got a recored deal
But a nigga 24 in the game, and ain't a damn thing changed still feinding for a recored deal still
Same as the ANR nigga you know I'm throwed, check the sound scan my cd's get sold
Living in a world so low and so cold, poverty got a nigga in a choke hold
Don't nobody love a nigga in these streets, if a nigga ain't got no bread
Turn to my family members when I'm looking for a place just to lay my head
Runnin' a fucked up state of mind, motherfuckers don't know a nigga well down inside
I broke bread with the world now the world can't break bread with, It got a nigga cryin' inside
Jesus can't you stop the hurt, everyday the grim reaper just start to flirt forgive me for my sins
But i got that work, I wanna wear my own clothes tired of wearing all my homeboys shirts
Sometimes I be looking for death making a death wish
Gone on and check a nigga of the checklist
I really need to get a peace of mind, fore I kick the bucket nigga my piece might still be restless
