Na na na na
Na na na na
Yeah
You are the music in me
You know the words once upon a time
Makes you listen
There's a reason

[Kelsi & Gabriella]
When you dream
There's a chance you'll find
A little laughter
Or happy ever after

[Gabriella & Troy]
Your harmony
To melody
Is echoing inside my head

[Gabriella]
A single voice

[Troy]
Single voice

[Gabriella]
Above the noise
And

[Troy & Gabriella]
Like a common thread

[Troy]
Hmm you're pullin' me

[Gabriella]
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong

[Troy]
Oh, you are the music in me
Yeah it's living in all of us

[Gabriella]
And it's brought us here because
