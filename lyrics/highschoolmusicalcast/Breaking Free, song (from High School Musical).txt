Boys: We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven 
That we can't reach

Girls: If we're trying 
So we're breaking free

Boys: You know the world can see us 
In a way that's different than who we are

Girls: Creating space between us 
'Til we're separate hearts
But your faith it gives me strength 
Strength to believe 

All: We're breaking free

Girls: We're soarin' 

Boys: Flyin'

All: There's not a star in heaven 
That we can't reach
If we're trying
Yeah, we're breakin' free 
Oh, we're breakin' free

Boys: Can you feel it building 
Like a wave the ocean just can't control

Girls: Connected by a feeling 
Ohhh, in our very souls 

All: Rising 'til it lifts us up 
So every one can see
We're breakin' free 

Girls: We're soarin'

Boys: Flyin'

All: There's not a star in heaven 
That we can't reach
If we're tryin' 
Yeah we're breaking free

Girls: Ohhhh runnin'

Boys:Climbin'

Boy's: More than hope
More than faith 

Girls: This is true 
This is fate 
And together 

All: We see it comin' 
More than you, More than me 
Not a want, but a need
All of us breakin' free 

Girls: Soarin'

Boys: Flyin' 

All: There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach 
If we're trying, yeah we're trying, 
yeah we're breaking free, breakin' free

Girls: We're runnin'

Boys: Ohhhh, climin'    

All:To get to the place 
To be all that we can be 
Now's the time 
So we're breakin' free
We're breakin' free, Ohhh, yeah 
To be all that we can be 
Now's the time,
So we're  breaking free,
Ohhh, we're breaking free,
You know the world can see us 
In a way that's different than who we are---Lyrics submitted by Vanessa.
