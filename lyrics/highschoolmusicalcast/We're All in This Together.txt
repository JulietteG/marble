Together, together, come on lets have some fun
Together, werethere for each other every time
Together together come on lets do this right

Here and now its time for celebration
I finally figured it out (yea yea)
That all our dreams have no limitations
Thats what its all about (yea yea)

Everyone is special in their own way
We make each other strong ( we make each other strong)
Were not the same
Were diffrent in a good way
Together's where we belong

Were all in this together 
Once we know
That we are
We're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together 
And it shows when we stand
Hand in Hand
Make our dreams come true

We're all here
and speaking out of one voice
we're going to rock the house (YEAH YEAH)
the party's on now everbody make some noice
come and scream and shout

We've arrived because we stuck together
Champions one and all

Wild cats everywhere 
Wave your hands up in the air
Thats the way we doiit
Let's get to it 
Come on everyone!!!---Lyrics submitted by yasmine.
