Ay yo ma, how you doin, it's ya son now
And I picked up the mic and put the drugs down
Now I'm tryin to do some things that'll make you proud
Instead of everytime I call it's to bail me out
Oh why didn't I listen to things you used to tell me
Knowin that everything that you said would never fail me
Like 'they got plans for ya
Ain't nothin I can do when them laws get they hands on ya'
But I ain't listenin, even payin attention
I'm just tryna get mine
Takin advantage, you would get two jobs at the same time
Ungrateful, complainin about Nike and Polo signs
But you always come through, and what do I do
I wreck both ya cars, stole money from ya drawers
Sold dope out ya yard, stayed into with them laws
Tryin to pay you back for all the stress that I caused
And always be there to give you whatever you want

[Hook]
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
Uh, uh, I said you don't have to worry no more
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
Uh, uh, uh, 'cause ya son will be there for you
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
Uh, uh, uh

Now verse two, yeah that's for you boo
I send ya props 'cause you the only one that stuck through
When I'm upset and stressed you give me back rubs
When I'm depressed you give me head off in the bathtub, E-I!
On ya P's and Q's, on ya Q's and P's
You hear my beeper goin off and you just throw me my keys
Ain't even askin me yo is it coochie or G's
And for that reason now you can ask me for anything
Not a for real smoker but you choke with me
Not too hot about the drinkin but you toast with me
Livin at ya granny house you kept the dope for me
And wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me
Need money, my boo'll go and work the avenue
My boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to
That's why I do the things I do
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want

[Hook]
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
Uh, uh, I said I don't wanna lose you no
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
Uh, uh, uh, 'cause you're my boo and my only one
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
Uh, uh, uh

I'm doin this one here for Shaun Haynes, Lashando and J.D.

And without Trail, Kuda and Coach it just wouldn't be
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin me)
I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
'Cause y'all my niggas for life you know
(Don't stop ever lovin me)
You can always smoke with me---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
