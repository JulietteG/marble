[Verse 1:]
Have a drink (have a drink)
Just get it in (just get it in)
Where your girls at? (girls)
Call your friends (call your friends)
Let the top bagging we can take a spin
Roll it up and we can blow it in the wind
What you mean (what you mean)
We hit the mall (we hit the mall)
Tell your man you gonna holla him tomorrow
And later on I'm gonna show you how to ball
But tonight shawty we gonna do it all

[Chorus:]
So what you waiting on I'm a come get you girl just hit me when you're leaving the club
Don't put them panties girl you ain't gonna need 'em cause I promise id be tearing it up
Cause we don't make love we'd be making movies
We don't make love we'd be making movies
Girl this ain't the time me in the jacuzzi
Watching all the signs running down on your booty
We don't make love we'd be making movies
We don't make love we'd be making movies
Girl this ain't the time me in the jacuzzi
Watching all the signs running down on your booty
Turn the lights off

[Verse 2:]
Back it up bend it over put it on me girl and drive
Go for what you know cause I love it when you're on top
This exciting when you're fighting you're fighting to get the spot
You can get that gwaup as long as you don't stop
On your back with your legs up all up in the air
Just keep 'em there you won't find nothing better
You're dealing with a playa yea the man right here

[Chorus:]
So what you waiting on I'm a come get you girl just hit me when you're leaving the club
Don't put them panties girl you ain't gonna need 'em cause I promise id be tearing it up
Cause we don't make love we'd be making movies
We don't make love we'd be making movies
Girl this ain't the time me in the jacuzzi
Watching all the signs running down on your booty
We don't make love we'd be making movies
We don't make love we'd be making movies
Girl this ain't the time me in the jacuzzi
Watching all the signs running down on your booty
Turn the lights off

[Bridge:]
I don't care let 'em stare they're be the audience
We're the superstars we'll be performing for all of 'em
You gonna scream my name and I'll put your name lights
I'm a change your life stay with me tonight
Ooooh

Cause we don't make love we'd be making movies
We don't make love we'd be making movies
Girl this ain't the time me in the jacuzzi
Watching all the signs running down on your booty
We don't make love we'd be making movies
We don't make love we'd be making movies
Girl this ain't the time me in the jacuzzi
Watching all the signs running down on your booty

Cause we don't make love we'd be making movies
We don't make love we'd be making movies
Girl this ain't the time me in the jacuzzi
Watching all the signs running down on your booty
We don't make love we'd be making movies
We don't make love we'd be making movies
Girl this ain't the time me in the jacuzzi
Watching all the signs running down on your booty
Turn the lights off ---Lyrics submitted by Devid Jonson.
