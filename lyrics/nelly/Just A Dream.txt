i was thinkin about her
 thinkin about me
 thinkin about us
what we gunna be
open my eyes
it was only just a dream

so i travel back down that road
will she come back
no one knows
and i realize, it was only just a dream

i was at the top
now its like im in the basement
number 1 spot
now shes found a replacement
i swear now i cant take it
knowing somebodys got my baby

now you aint around, baby i cant think
i should put it down, shoulda got that ring
cuz i can still feel it in the air
see her pretty face
run my fingers through her hair

my lover
my life
my shawty
my wife
she left me, im tight
cuz i knew that it just aint right

i was thinkin about her
 thinkin about me
 thinkin about us
what we gunna be
open my eyes
and it was only just a dream

so i travel back down that road
will she come back
no one knows
and i realize, it was only just a dream

and i be ridin
and i swear i see her face and every time
i try to get my usher on but i cant let it burn
and i just hope that she notice she the only one i yearn for
no more sooner will i learn

didnt give her all my love
i guess now i got my payback
now im in the club thinking all about my baby

she was so easy to love
but wait, i guess that love wasnt enough
im goin through it every time that im alone
now im missin' wishing she would just pick up the phone
but she made a decision that she wanted to move on
cuz i was wrong

i was thinkin about her
 thinkin about me
 thinkin about us
what we gunna be
open my eyes
and it was only just a dream

so i travel back down that road
will she come back
no one knows
and i realize, it was only just a dream

if you ever loved somebody put your hands up x2
and now theyre gone and you wish you could give them everything (x2)

i was thinkin about her
 thinkin about me
 thinkin about us
what we gunna be
open my eyes
 it was only just a dream

so i travel back down that road
will she come back
no one knows
and i realize, it was only just a dream
