It's bigger than love,
Brighter than all the stars combined,
It's dwarfing the sun,
Burning within my heart and mind.

I live with my memories,
Of bustling fervor of New York,
We're on 59th Street,
Quarreled and broke the bathroom door

'Cause you were just drinking,
Drinking till you could hardly see,
Of how much I loved you,
But I couldn't bring myself to leave

It's bigger than love,
Brighter than all the stars combined,
Dwarfing the sun,
Burning within my heart and mind.

Our summers in Paris,
The Seine overflowing with champagne,
And I knew you stepped out,
But you knew that I had done the same.

Though we had a child there,
We couldn't raise her on our own,
So our house got crowded,
I never felt so home alone.

It's bigger than love,
Brighter than all the stars combined,
Dwarfing the sun,
Burning within my heart and mind.

It's bigger than love,
Brighter than all the stars combined,
Dwarfing the sun,
Burning within my heart and mind.

Stranded in Nashville,
Failing to fix a broken head,
We're in California
Doing the work of lesser men.  

What what of our daughter?
What of the love we once shared?

It's living inside us,
Battered, but not beyond repair.

Our fate decreed, 
A singularity,
A solemn tune,
I played at night and danced around you.

It's bigger than love,
Brighter than all the stars combined,
Dwarfing the sun,
Burning within my heart and mind.

It's bigger than love,
Brighter than all the stars combined,
It's dwarfing the sun,
Burning within my heart and mind.

It's bigger than love,
Brighter than all the stars combined,
(It's) dwarfing the sun,
Burning within my heart and mind.

It's bigger than love,
Brighter than all the stars combined,
Dwarfing the sun,
Burning within my heart and mind.---Lyrics submitted by Richard Sima.
