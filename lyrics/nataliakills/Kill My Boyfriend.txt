I'm rolling the dice, got the wind in my hair
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend, yeah
Cause he's only nice, when there's somebody there
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend

[Natalia Kills]
It's been a minute love
Wish we'd never broke it off, oh oh oh
I hated that we separated, can't forget you no

But now I got an another, I got a ring,
I got a lover, I'm about to have a mother in law
And things are kinda perfect, but I know you're fucking worth it
There's only one thing I can do to break it off, come on

[Chorus]
I'm rolling the dice, got the wind in my hair
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend, yeah
Cause he's only nice, when there's somebody there
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend

Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, Kill, kill, kill
So we can run away just like we said
Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, Kill, kill, kill
So we can be together like we planned

[Natalia Kills]
You're the one I want, everything I'm dreaming off
Don't make me break his heart into million pieces, no
But every time I'm with him, I imagine that we're kissing
And I'm wishing he was you all along
And boy I'm so committed, I'm so deep, there's no more digging

There's only one thing I can do to solve this mess, come one

[Chorus]
I'm rolling the dice, got the wind in my hair
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend, yeah
Cause he's only nice, when there's somebody there
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend

Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, Kill, kill, kill
So we can run away just like we said
Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, Kill, kill, kill
So we can be together like we planned

I gotta kill my boyfriend yeah...

[Bridge]
And I'll do the time, you're my sweetest crime
You know that I'll wait for you, baby
And we'll be apart, but you'll have heart
I'm saving it all for you, baby
And I'll do the time, you're my sweetest crime
You know that I'll wait for you, baby
And we'll be apart, but you'll have heart
I'm saving it all for you, baby

[Natalia Kills]
Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, Kill, kill, kill
So we can run away just like we said
Kill, kill, kill, I'm gonna, Kill, kill, kill
So we can be together like we planned

Mmmm I gotta, ooh don't wanna, mmm I gotta kill my boyfriend---
