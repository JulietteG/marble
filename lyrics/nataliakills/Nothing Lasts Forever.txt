(feat. Billy Kraven)

You got a face like a doll
will it last forever, no
I just want your beautiful
you don't need to think about it
tell me things I wanna hear
take the truth, I'll take the dare
Feed me lies and eat my fear
cut the chase and get right to it

We might never meet again
(This might be the last time)
Kiss me like the end will end
(Press your lips right up my spine)
pull that shirt, I'll pull the shade
(dirty secrets, dirty lies)
you can be my last regret
my last regret

You're beautiful
don't know your name
it's all the same
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
You take it off
I throw it all away
I gave it to you first
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
Cash, Cars, Girls, Boys
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
Hot nights, bright lights
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
True love, first touch,
Nothing Lasts Forever
Nothing Lasts Forever
Nothing Lasts Forever babe

[Billy Kraven]
You taste like I like it
acid mixed with alcohol
step me up to take the fall
nothing I can do about it
hey don't take it personal
worth the pain, I'm versatile
quick before they milk it all
no one gives a f*ck about it.

We might never meet again
(This might be the last time)
Kiss me like the end will end
(Press your lips right up my spine)
pull that shirt, I'll pull the shade
(dirty secrets, dirty lies)
you can be my last regret
my last regret

You're beautiful
don't know your name
it's all the same
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
You take it off
I throw it all away
I gave it to you first
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
Cash, Cars, Girls, Boys
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
Hot nights, bright lights
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
True love, first touch,
Nothing Lasts Forever
Nothing Lasts Forever
Nothing Lasts Forever babe

You're beautiful
don't know your name
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
You take it off
I throw it all away
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
Nothing Lasts Forever
Nothing Lasts Forever
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
Cash, Cars, Girls, Boys
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
Hot nights, bright lights
Nothing Lasts Forever babe
True love, first touch,
Nothing Lasts Forever
Nothing Lasts Forever
Nothing Lasts Forever babe---Lyrics submitted by Angel.
