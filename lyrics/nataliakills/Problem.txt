VERSE I:
Sweat
Dripping down your chest
Thinking bout your tattooed knuckles
On my thigh boy boy boy
Cold
Shower you got no
Power to control
How I make you my toy toy toy
My hips rocking
As we keep lip locking
Got the neighbors screaming
Even louder louder
Lick me down like you were
Rolling rizla
Im smoking
Come and put me out.

HOOK:
Im your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
Oh Baby
You so bad boy
Drive me mad boy
But you dont care when they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem

VERSE II:
I got your name
Hanging from my chain
Dont you wanna claim
My body like a vandal?
You got the cure
Underneath your shirt
Dont you wanna save this
Dirty little damsel?
Got my mink coat falling on the
Motel floor youre on the bed
Wolf whistling louder louder
Your lips smudging all my
Make up kicking both my heels off
Come and pin me down

HOOK:
Im your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
Oh Baby
You so bad boy
Drive me mad boy
But you dont care when they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem

BRIDGE:
THAT GIRL
IS A GOD DAMN PROBLEM
THAT GIRL
IS A GOD DAMN PROBLEM
THAT GIRL
IS A GOD DAMN PROBLEM
Were hell raising
And we dont need saving

Cause there's no salvation for a bad girl
Were rock bottom
But there aint no stopping
Cause they dont know nothing about love
Were hell raising
And we dont need saving
Cause there's no salvation for a bad boy
Were rock bottom
But there aint no stopping
Cause its you and me against the world

HOOK:
Im your dream girl
This is real love
But you know what they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
Oh Baby
You so bad boy
Drive me mad boy

But you dont care when they say about me
That girl is a problem
Girl is a problem
Girl is a problem problem
Let me see you take your

Shirt, shoes, jeans, all off
Shirt, shoes, jeans, all off
And we aint even at the beach
Im a take my
Skirt, boots, rings, all off
Skirt, boots, rings, all off
And we aint even at the beach
God damn Problem.---Lyrics submitted by Phillip Kelly.
