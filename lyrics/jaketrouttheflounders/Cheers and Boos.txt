Gime one good shot to the 16th green
Where the cheers and boos can become obscene.
Stadium golf at the TPC
Where a deuce is great, but Id take a three.
One shot you win
One shot you lose
Drowned out by the cheers and boos
Save me from this misery
Just get me to the 17th tee

Theres nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Just tee it up and let er fly
Just one swing, thats all ya get to prove youre the man
	(Hey, I got my own jet)
Well, that thing didnt pay for itself
So check out the trophies on my shelf
Its hard to think with all this racket
Give me a break, hey, I won a green jacket

Gime one good shot to the 16th green
Where the cheers and boos can become obscene.
Stadium golf at the TPC
Where a deuce is great, but Id take a three.
One shot you win
One shot you lose
Drowned out by the cheers and boos
Save me from this revelry
Just get me to that 17th tee.

Now why cant these yahoos just be a little calmer
And treat me like Im Arnold Palmer?
Hes the man and Ill bet hes seen worse
These folks could make even Arnie curse.

One hundred and sixty yards to carry
Why in the world is it so scary?
Ready to hit, but my hands are shakin
Afraid of the  I may be takin.

I got some real bad thoughts runnin through my head
Dont hit it fat, is what my caddie said
Everyone says yuh gotta go for broke
But Johnnie Miller thinks Im gonna choke

Well now some dont mind the celebration
But it sure dont help my concentration
Were just a wild bunch that yuh cant control
Got twenty thousand fans yellin, Get in the HOLE!

[Thats right, baby!  Thats what Im doin!]

So, Gime one good shot to the 16th green
Where the cheers and boos can become obscene.
Stadium golf at the TPC
Where a deuce is great, but Id take a three.
One shot you win
One shot you lose
Drowned out by the cheers and boos
Save me from this misery
Just get it to that 17th tee.

Yuh just wont believe what youre gonna see
Try to play a shot from the 16th tee.---Lyrics submitted by Mark Stebbins.
