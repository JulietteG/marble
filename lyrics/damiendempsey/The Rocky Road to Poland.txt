Twas in the merry month of
June from our home we started
Left old Eireann's Isle, to Poland we departed
Hope within our hearts.
We can win a trophy
We're a part of Trapattoni's army,
Get behind the team, hear the Irish scream,
C'mon you boys in green, Ireland's bouncing back again,
We have got our Trap, the cat is in the sack,
We'll not forget you Jack on the Rocky Road to Poland
One, two, three, four, five
Irish eyes are smiling
Let your voices ring,
Trapattoni's army,
Everybody sing
You'll never beat the Irish (x 4)
Make your mother proud, inflate your plastic hammer,
Bate your bodhrn loud and learn your Polish grammar
Credit union loan, sold the Opel Corsa,
Hired a camper van, picked it up in Warsaw,
Been so close before, hopes slammed in the door,
Now we're back for more, we can win the battle,
C'mon you boys in green, never have we seen,
Such a fearless team on the Rocky Road to Poland.
One, two, three, four, five
Irish eyes are smiling
Let your voices ring,
Trapattoni's army,
Everybody sing
You'll never beat the Irish
You'll never beat the Irish
You'll never beat the Irish
You'll never beat the Irish
Ireland ab. We love.---
