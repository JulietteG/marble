Girl I've been hurt in the past, cut up
I find it hard to bring down my guard

Hold me closely and softly sweetly kiss my lips, my lips
Oh baby, baby, baby
Hold me closely and softly sweetly kiss your lips, your lips
It's been so long since I heard that song
It always does remind me of us

The last time that I saw you I shouted and I fought you
That awful night we parted was when this nightmare started
But now tonight I see you and Jesus how I miss you

Oh baby, baby, baby
Hold me closely and softly sweetly kiss my lips, my lips
Oh baby, baby, baby
Hold me closely, I softly sweetly kiss your lips, your lips---Lyrics submitted by gabriel cullen.
