I was a traveller traveling along crossing that desert they call Leonon, lost in a valley of shadows and sinkin sand hopelessly searchin over my head , patiently watin for my last step I was a desperate woman in no man's land like an angel of mercy , emotional, you took in your arms and out of danger you rescued me in the nick of time I was right on the edge of going out of my mind  i was running on empty down to a crawl facing a future with noone at all, and just before i found out i lied about how love can be, you rescued me. The mind can play tricks when youre wonderin out there making up visions out of thin air. That's why I thought I was dreaming when you appeared. But your touch had feeling your kisses were real. Your voice echoued like a song on a hill. Somehow you knew what my heart needed to hear. Like an angel of mercy, emotional savior you took me in your arms and out of danger. You rescued me in the nick of time, I was right on the edge of going out of my mind. I was running on empty down to a crawl, facing a future with noone at all and just before I found out I lied about how love can be, you rescued me. Ohhh. Ohhh. You rescued me in the nick of time. I was running on empty, down to a crawl, facing a future with noone at all, and just before I found out I lied, about how love can be, you rescued me in the nick of time, I was right on the egde of going out of my mind, running on empty, down to a crawl, facing a future with noone at all, you rescued me in the nick of time I was right on the edge of going out of my mind, I was running on empty down to a crawl facing a future with noone at all, you rescued me in the nick of time, I was right on the edge...---Lyrics submitted by Sylvia.
