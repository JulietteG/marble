Been driving through the night
Pull up and see the lights
This is the place that I call home

I watch you as you dream
I think of all you mean to me
Touch your face, kiss you softly

And before I go to sleep
I pray under the stars
Search my soul and Check my heart

And thank God for another day, another chance
To love the ones I love
To find my way, to laugh and dance
To watch the sun come up

Another day I get to live
As if every breath could be the last I take
I get another day

I have a hand that I can hold
Someone who knows my soul
A safe place to lay my head at night

Still sometimes I forget
Just how much I've been blessed in life
I forget what means the most to me, yeah

But I'm waking up again
I feel my beating heart
So grateful that I've come this far

I thank God for another day, another chance
To love the ones I love
To find my way, to laugh, to dance
And watch the sun come up

Another day I get to live
As if every breath could be the last I take
I get another day

Another day to make somebody smile
To go the extra mile
To take a wrong and make it right
Yeah, I'm trying to touch somebody's life
I get another day

Thank God for another day
To love the ones I love
To find my way, to laugh, to dance
And watch the sun come up

Another day I get to live
As if every breath could be the last I take
I get another day

To find my way, to laugh, to dance
And watch the sun come up
Another day I get to live
As if every breath could be the last I take
To chase somebody's dreams, oh I can't wait

I get another day.....
Ooh ooh..
I get another day.....---Lyrics submitted by Rose.
