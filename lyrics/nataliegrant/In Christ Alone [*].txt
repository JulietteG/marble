In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my Light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firmed through the fiercest drought and storm

What heights of love
What depths of peace
When fears are still
When striving ceased
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on flesh
Fulness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

Til on that cross as Jesus died
the wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

there in the ground his body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the Precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

No power of hell
No scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Til He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I stand---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
