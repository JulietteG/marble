Happiness is temporary
Its here and gone in a flash of light
Troubles come without a warning
To turn the day into the night

Ohhh, when everything is changing
Ohhh, the truth is still the same
Ohhh, and I know that no one can
Ever steal it away

Im gonna dance to the beat of amazing grace
Gonna hold to the promise that You made
And I know whatevers gonna come my way
Youre here with me and its going to be a good day
its going to be a good day, a good day

Fear can be so, so convincing
But I will keep my eyes on You
In every moment help me remember
That You always will bring me through
Ohhh, cause Youre forever faithful
Ohhh, the Truth is still the same
Ohhh, and I know that no one can
Ever steal it away

Im gonna dance to the beat of amazing grace
Gonna hold to the promise that You made
And I know whatevers gonna come my way
Youre here with me and its going to be a good day
its going to be a good day, a good day
Come my way
Youre here with me and its going to be a good day

And You carry me, carry me
And You carry me, carry me
And You carry me, carry me

Because Youre for me
Youll be with me till the end
Because Youre for me
Youll be with me till the end
Because Youre for me
Youll be with me till the end
Because Youre for me
Youll be with me till the end

Im gonna dance to the beat of amazing grace
Gonna hold to the promise that You made
And I know whatevers gonna come my way
Youre here with me and its going to be a good day
its going to be a good day, a good day
Come my way
Youre here with me and its going to be a good day---
