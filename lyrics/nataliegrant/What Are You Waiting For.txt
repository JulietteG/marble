Sometimes i get that 
Overwhelming feeling
So sad the faces on tv
If i tried to make a difference would it help anyway
But then i stop and to
Myself i say

So you wanna change the world
What are you waiting for
Say you wanna start right now 
What are you waiting for it only takes on voice
So come on now and shout it out 
Give a little more 
What are you waiting for

Sometimes i feel a little
Helpless 
Seems like i cant do a thing
But anything is possible just 
You wait and see
Good things will happen if you
Just believe

So you wanna change the world
What are you waiting for 
Say your gonna start right now 
What are you waiting for
It only takes one voice 
So come on now shout it out
Give a little more
What are you waiting for

Some day some how
Your
Gonna take that step
Cause time is ticking away

Right here right
Now
Before it's too late
Gonna face
Tomarrow today

So you wanna change the world 
What are you waiting for
Say your gonna start right now
What are you waiting for
It only takes one voice 
So come on now and shout it out
Give a little more 
What are you waiting for (X2)---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
