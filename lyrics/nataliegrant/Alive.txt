Who but You
Could breathe and leave a trail of galaxies,
And dream of me

What kind of love
Is writing my story to the end,
With Mercy's pen?

Only You

What kind of King
Would choose to wear a crown that bleeds and scars,
to win my heart

What kind of love
Tells me he's the reason he can't stay,
Inside the grave

You
Is it you
Standing here before my eyes
Every part of my heart cries
Alive (x2)

Look what Mercy's overcome
Death has lost and Love has won!
Alive (x2)

Hallelujah, Risen Lord
The only one I fall before
I am his
Because he is
Alive

Who could speak
And send the demons back from where they came,
With just one name

What other heart
Would let itself be broken every time,
until he healed mine

You, only you
Could turn my darkness into dawn
Running right into your arms

Alive (x2)
Look what Mercy's overcome
Death has lost and love has won!

Alive (x2)
Hallelujah, Risen Lord
The only one I fall before

I am his
Because he is

Emmanuel, the promised king
The baby who made angels sing

Son of man who walked with this
Healing breathing in our dust

The author of all histories
The answer to all mysteries

The lamb of God who rolled away
The stone in front of every grave

Alive (x2)
Look what Mercy's overcome
Death has lost and love has won!

Hallelujah 

I am his
Because he is

ALIVE (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Bethany Bluw.
