Men were executed, women bled,
Meat and fish changed hands and children stayed up late.
Uh huh.
Colored drums, they press (?) the night,
There's a taxidermist looking for a fight (alt.: grinning with delight)
But now he's gone, oh yeah,
Only the stones remain.

Girls were decked with flowers and violated (alt.: ovulated)
While boys spat juice from out of a fresh young bowl (?),
Soldiers crossed their hearts and died,
Pretty girls turned cold inside,
But now they're gone, oh yeah,
Only the stones remain.

And the stones have forgotten them.
The stones have forgotten them.

They break your body and drain the life out of it,
It sinks into the soil while your soul flies up into the air above,
And when there's no more tears to cry,
There's nothing left to do but... laugh!
Stained glass elaborations collapse and candy floss evaporates, honey,
Only the stones remain.
They're gone.
Only the stones remain.---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
