Nobody said that life is always fair
sometimes it clips your wings while you in mid-air
but there's a thread between your life and mine
and when you're losin hope this rope won't unwind

chorus
hold on tight cause life is touch and go 
it's sink or swim but never doubt 
if you're out on a limb i'll get the call to break your fall
i'll never leave you even when life is touch and go 
or hit and run we'll never break if take it as one
i'm here to stay i pray you know i'll never touch
i'll never touch and go

someday you'll find there's nothin' in the night
that wasn't there before you turned out the light
straight from your mind the monster neath your bed
the voices in the hall they're all in your head

repeat chorus

when you feel lost you're only spun around 
tumbled and tossed but never run around 
life is a townful of strangers at best 
i'll help you home GOD help the rest

repeat chorus---Lyrics submitted by lovely.
