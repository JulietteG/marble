There are songs that sound like movies
There are themes that fill the screen
There are lines I say that sound as if they're written
There are looks I wear the theater should've seen

But though I've made my life a movie
The matinee must end by five
And I must stagger out into the blinding sunlight, half alive
Wishing I were back inside the picture show, there, where it's always night
Notice how the screen is wide, the second row wraps it around you tight
Will I stay?  Yes, I might

WIDESCREEN, wind around my eyes
Blind my mind with lies
Find a world like nothin' that I'd seen
Oh, WIDESCREEN dreams are just my size

As we walk from out the movie
Do I look like Steve McQueen?
Does the orchestra play chords when we start loving?
Do we move just like slow motion on the screen?

Life's a constant disappointment
When you live on celluloid
But my movie expectations are a dream I can't avoid
Waitin' for a girl to say the things that I heard in a film last night
But she doesn't want to play the role and she can't pick her cues up right
Will I dream?  Yes, I might

Oh, WIDESCREEN, wind around my eyes
Blind my mind with lies
Find a world like nothin' that I'd seen
Oh, WIDESCREEN, take the world away
Break me from the day
Make me be what's not for real
And make me feel like a star
Make me what you are.---Lyrics submitted by Marilyn Harris.
