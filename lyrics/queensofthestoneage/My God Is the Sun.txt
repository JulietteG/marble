Far beyond the desert road 
Where everything hangs off 
So good the empty space 
And to erase the given... 

Healing, like fire from above 
Kneeling, my god is the sun 
Healing, with fire from above 
Kneeling, my god is the sun 

I dont know what time it was 
I don't wear a watch 
So good to be an ant who crawls 
Atop a spinning rock 

Healing, like fire from above 
Kneeling, my god is the sun 
Healing, with fire from above 
Kneeling, my god is the sun 

Healing, like fire from above 
Kneeling, my god is the sun 
Feeling, Healing, nothing (loving?) 
... 
Love us 
Heal us 
Always (look at?) the sky---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
