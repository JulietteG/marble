I sat by the ocean & drank a potion to erase you.
Face down in the Boulevard, yet I couldnt face you.
There aint no use in crying. It doesnt change anything,
So what good does it do?
Your friends, they all sympathize.
Maybe, I dont need them too.

You. Me. & a lie.
Silence is closer.
Were passing ships in the night.

Theres nowhere to run away.
Said,
boy if you want love, youll have to go & find it with someone new.
do you know who you really are? are you sure its really you?
Lies are a funny thing.
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you.
Time wounds all the heals. Then we fade out of view.

You. Me. & a lie.
Silence is closer.
Were passing ships in the night.
End to the night, left with nowhere to hide.
Closer
& closer
Were crashing ships in the night---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
