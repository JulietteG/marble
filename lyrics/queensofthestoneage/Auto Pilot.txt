Saw you down there on the marble slab,
The best trip that I've ever had,
High up in a jet plane, pass it around,
My drinks on empty, need another round.

I wanna fly, wanna ride with you,
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you,
High up in a jet plane with you.

When we arrive in the middle of nowhere,
Don't act like you know, I been here so many times,
I never seen you before,
But now that I have, I don't wanna see you no more.

High up in a jet plane with you,
High up in a jet plane with you.

I wanna fly, wanna ride with you,
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you,
High up in a jet plane with you.

Ahh, auto pilot no control...
Ahh, ahh...
Ahh, auto pilot no control...
Ahh, ahh...

High up in a jet plane with you...
High up in a jet plane with you.---Lyrics submitted by Stefan.
