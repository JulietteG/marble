No, I don't care
If the sun shine me a day
No, I don't care 
If the sun shine me today
Clouded sight, clouded mind
Keeps on getting in the way
It just gets in the way

Just gets in the way
Just gets in the way
Just gets in the way
Gotta keep on drowning in this cage

No, I don't care 
If those stars come out to play
Just don't care 
If those stars come out to play

 City lights and these fast cars
They keep on driving in my way
Oh it just gets in the way

Just gets in my way
Just gets in the way
Just gets in the way
Gotta keep on drowning in this cage

Just gets in the way
Just gets in my way
Just keep on getting in the way
Oh you get right in the way
Gotta keep on drowning in this cage
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Eric Hanley.
