It wasn't long ago
When I found you with someone that I din't know
Now you apology
It's meaningless to me

I could take it back
How could you use words like that
No I don't forgive you
You realise it's all [...]

Chorus 
You know I'm leaving,
I'm living here on my home
Found me some new friends
Found me a home

Stand back five feet
My temper won't get the best of me
I see as you
Put a timebomb in my room
How it ticks
Plays tricks with my wits
The timebomb is you
And the evil things you do

You know I'm leaving,
I'm living here on my home
Found me some new friends
Found me a home

Just leave me alone
Why can't you let me be
Just let me be
You can't control yourself
And you don't control me
Don't you let me be, 
Just let me be
No you don't control me
No you don't control me

[Solo]

You know I'm leaving,
I'm living here on my home
Found me some new friends
Found me a home

Just leave me alone
Why can't you let me be
Just let me be
You can't control yourself
And you don't control me
Just let me be 
Just let me be
No you don't control me
No you don't control me---Lyrics submitted by Pedro Pavan.
