Well I been gone,
gone for days.
She done said,
God's changed your ways..
God changed your ways..
your evil ways.

She done leaved,
gone her way.
Take her things and she don't stay.
Well I ain't changed,
changed my ways.
I ain't change.
Cause I can't hide, oohhhh
Cause I can't hide, oohhhh
Hey!
My evil ways

So I done gone,
cross that way.
To win her back,
to make her stay.
To change my ways,
my evil ways.

But I found out,
her love grows cold.
Her bed lights on,
my best friend home.
They ain't changed,
changed their ways.
They ain't changed.
So I won't hide, oohhhh
I won't hide, oohhhh
I won't hide, oohhhh
I won't hide, oohhhh
Hey!
My evil ways.

So I don't cry,
cry no tears.
Cause she done gone and left me here,
cause I ain't changed.
Changed my ways.
I ain't hide,
cause I can't hide, oohhhh
I can't hide, oohhhh
I don't hide, oohhhh
I can't hide, oohhhh
Hey!
My evil ways...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
