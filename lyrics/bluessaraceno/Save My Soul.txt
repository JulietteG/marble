When I got to Memphis
To put my ol' baby down
Despair was all around me
Confusion is what I found
So I called me the sheriff
I said bring my wife the gun
But please don't let her hurt me now
That girl just havin' fun
He said:
I can't take you to heaven
I can't save your soul
I can't promise forever
Hey, yeah save my soul
Hey now, whoa save my soul
Got my heart in your hands
I can't feel my soul
Well I found me a doctor
To get me what I need
Paranoia had surround me
Smoke and fire is what I see
So he hands me a bible
To take my last stand
But the devil he done ignore
While the doctor does all he can
Hey, yeah save my soul
Whoa save my soul
Got my heart in your hands
I can't feel, feel my soul
I got my heart in your hands
I can't feel
I got my heart in your hands
I can't feel, feel my soul---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
