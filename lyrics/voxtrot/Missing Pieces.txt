I would go to pieces
If you said that this was just an act to
Come and take the sleep out of my night

I would go to pieces 
If you said that this was just an act to
Come and take the shine out of my light

Oh and I go, through it all
Oh its a thing like habit, I know

I would feel much better 
If I thought there was any other reason
To keep away the beauty from the dirt

And I would do much better 
If I thought I'd feel any other need
And I miss you, oh
And I miss you, oh

And i would be complete 
If you could put me down in facts and figures
The hardest things are always black and white

And i would be complete
If you could touch me once but it never figures
That easy things are never really right

Oh and I go, day by day
Oh its a thing to live for, I know

I would feel much better 
If I thought there was any other reason
To keep away the beauty from the dirt

And I would do much better 
If I thought I'd feel any other need
And I miss you, oh
And I miss you, oh

Why dont you take a walk outside
And see the mess I made
And see the mess I made
And I will be waiting with a knife
Just like an angry child,
Just like an angry child

And why dont you go and spread the word 
Just like some disease
Just like some disease
I know your mother taught you
That you are God
But you are just a boy..

I would feel much better 
If I thought there was any other reason
To keep away the beauty from the dirt

And I would do much better 
If I thought I'd feel any other need
And I miss you, oh
And I miss you, oh

I would feel much better 
If I thought there was any other reason
To keep away the beauty from the dirt

And I would do much better 
If I thought I'd feel any other need
And I miss you, oh
And I miss you, oh

And I miss you
And I miss you---Lyrics submitted by dalia.
