The right side's in the wrong 
And what's left's just holding on 
And the public has been privatized 
But I believe in something here on earth 
When did the punks stop being mad? 
They penned love songs while we got had 
The hippies sold out traded pot for coke 
Moved to the 'burbs/found god in a vote 

But I believe in something here on earth 
Just dance like you're disappointed in the world 
Just dance miserable 
Sorry Hank, there's room in here 
Had squares in the oval for about 8 years 
It's as bad as I remember and it's only getting worse 
It only gets better when it hurts 

But I believe in something here on earth 
Just dance like you're disappointed in the world 
Just dance miserable 

Unemployed? 
Dance 
Foreclosed? 
Dance 
Uninsured? 
Dance 
Climate change? 
Depressed? 
Depressed? 
The decline of western civilization? 

Just dance like you're disappointed in the world 
Just dance miserable---Lyrics submitted by Daizy.
