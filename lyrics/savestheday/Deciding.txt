And it's not fair-why do I have to be so?
Oh I feel everything much more-
much more than you ever will
and it's too hard when I can't even catch your eye
so I can't send you messages
and at night I dream of reasons that I can't let you go
but I don't know if it's time to crack through your walls so thick that I can't see past you
and last summer wasn't enough for me
and now that winter comes the cold beats harder
and no one is left alone and I'm offering you me right now-
take me I'm yours
and I won't have it any other way
so don't let fools be carried by what I say because the night keeps looking our way
and you're not seeing what I'm missing 'cause I am missing you
and I think that we should run as fast as we can into what we don't know-
it's time to let me in because I feel just fine.---Lyrics submitted by Trinity.
