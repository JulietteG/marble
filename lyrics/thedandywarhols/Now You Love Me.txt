When I met you
I could not have known this much about you
But you looked all right to me

So I led you home
Said some things I might have read
and somehow touched you
You said you loved me

You love me
Now you love me
You love me
Now you love me

Now I know I told you
When I took you in
Of my intention
How in you I could get
Do you hope you [something]
Into my defense
For in my darkest
My lack of consequence

You love me
Now you love me
You love me
Now you love me

You love me
Oh, oh, etc.---Lyrics submitted by dawniris.
