You got a great car. 
Yeah, what's wrong with it today? 
I used to have one too, 
Maybe I'll come and have a look. 
I really love your hairdo, yeah. 
I'm glad you like mine too, 
See we're looking pretty cool. 
Getcha! 

So what do you do? 
Oh yeah, I wait tables too. 
No I haven't heard your band 
Cause you guys are pretty new. 
But if you dig on Vegan food. 
Well come over to my work 
I'll have them cook you something that you'll really love. 

Cause I like you, 
Yeah I like you. 
And I'm feeling so Bohemian like you, 
Yeah I like you, 
Yeah I like you, 
And I feel wahoo, wahoo, wahoo! 

Wait. Who's that guy just hanging at your pad? 
He's lookin' kinda bummed. 
Yeah you broke up that's too bad. 
I guess it's fair if he always pays the rent 
And he doesn't get all bent 
About sleepin' on the couch when I'm there. 

Cause I like you, 
Yeah I like you. 
And I'm feeling so Bohemian like you. 
Yeah I like you. 
Yeah I like you 
And I feel wahoo, wahoo, wahoo! 

I'm getting wise 
And I feel so bohemian like you. 
It's you that I want so please, 
Just a casual, casual easy thing. 
Is it? It is for me 

And I like you 
Yeah I like you 
And I like you, I like you, I like you, 
Yeah I like you. 
And I feel wahoo, wahoo, wahoo!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
