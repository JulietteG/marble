Hoo...ooh...ooh...ooh...hoo...
Whoa...whoa...oh, yeah, yeah

Now I am standing here
Where I wanna be
With you right next to me
And soon a simple word or two
Will mark this special day
And send us on our way

Into a world where I'm not scared to say,
I do believe my dreams are safe with you
From now on I give you my love
I offer my hand and the joy in my soul
From now on my heart will behold
And over and over I fall
I surrender all
All of my life from now on (Oh, oh) {Yeah, yeah}

Now I will promise you
Every breath I breathe
Will keep you close to me
So close that deep inside you'll know
Whenever we're apart
Love will light the dark

And bring it back to the night of our first kiss
And back to tender moments just like this, oh

From now on I give you my love
I offer my hand and the joy in my soul
From now on my heart will behold
And over and over I fall
I surrender all
All of my life from now on (Mmm)

Ooh, we will be together
{From now on} From now on, baby
It's you and I forever {You and I}
From now on
Here where we belong

From now on I give you my love
I offer my hand and the joy in my soul, ooh...ooh...
From now on my heart will behold
And over and over and over I fall
I surrender all {I surrender all, yeah}
All of my life from now on
All of my life from now on (On, now on, yeah)
Yeah... 

OH WE WILL BE TOGETHER FROM NOW ON
FROM NOW ON BABY
IT'S YOU AND I FOREVER FROM NOW ON
HERE WHERE WE BELONG

FROM NOW ON I GIVE YOU MY LOVE
I OFFER MY HAND AND THE JOY IN MY SOUL
FROM NOW ON MY HEART WILL BE WHOLE
AND OVER AND OVER AFAR I SURRENDER ALL
ALL OF MY LIFE FROM NOW ON
ALL OF MY LIFE FROM NOW ON
