I want to know,
I got to know
What are you made of?
What are you made of?
You never look me in the eye;
I never see the inside of your eye.
Do, do you look at anyone, at anyone?
What are you made of?
What are you made of?

What kind of animal are we?
I always knew you'd make a fool of me,
And I could never look you in the eye -
You prove me right, so do not ask me why.

What kind of animal are we?
I should have never let you into me.
But I never, never learned to swim
Until you came around and pushed me in.

Either in love or never in love,
Always run away, always run away.

You and I, we'll never realize
Fleeting moments that pass by
Are all we ever have.

Either in doubt or never in doubt,
Always run away, always run away.
What kind of animal are we?

I always knew you'd make a fool of me.
And I could never look you in the eye,
You prove me right so do not ask me why.
What kind of animal are we?
I should have never let you into me.
But I never, never learned to swim
Until you came around and pushed me in.

Either in love, or never in love
Always run away, always run away.

I want to know,
I gotta know
What are you made of?
What are you made of.---Lyrics submitted by Eva.
