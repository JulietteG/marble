Walking a fine line between wrong and right
And I know there is a part of me
That I try to hide

But I can win
And I can fight
I keep holding on too tight
Runnin away from the world outside

Now I am calling
Hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody to believe in something

And I won't fear this 
When I am falling
We all need somebody that can mend
These broken bones

Caught in the confines
Of a simple life
And I am holding my head high in the rising tide

And I can win 
And I can fight
I keep holding on too tight
Runnin away from the world outside

Now I am calling
Hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody to believe in something

And I won't fear this 
When I am falling
We all need somebody that can mend
These broken bones

Boooooones......yeah

I 'm not coming home now
I know
I'm so far away
So far from home

I'm not coming home now
I know
I'm so far away
I'm so far away

And I can win
And I can fight
I keep holding on too tight

Now I am calling
Hoping you'll hear me
We all need somebody to believe in something

And I won't fear this
When I am falling
We all need somebody than can mend
These broken bones

And I can win
And I can fight
I keep holding on too tight
Runnin away from the world outside

And I can
And I can fight
I keep holding on too tight
Runnin away from the world outside---Lyrics submitted by Wendi.
