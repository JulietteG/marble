1st Verse:
Take your places please, you'll need to set for this one
It's a simple plan with mangled conclusion.

Give us a minute alone 
Your gonna follow me down

Chorus:
Hangman (you're wanna follow me)
How long (into the bottom we're)
Headstrong (drink from the bottle)
Until this city tears us both apart

Hang, Man, Hang

2nd Verse:
Numb your senses please, you won't remember them for too long
Sound the Hell alarm and commence the corruption

Your gonna follow me
Your gonna follow me down

Hang, Man, Hang---Lyrics submitted by Jon.
