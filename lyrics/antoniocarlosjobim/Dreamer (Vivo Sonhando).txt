Why are my eyes always full of this vision of you
why do I dream silly that I feel won't come true
I long to show you the stars
caught in the dark of the sea
I long to speak of my love
but you don't come to me

So I go on asking maybe if one day you'd care
I tell my sad little dreams to the soft evening air
I am quite hopeless
two things I know how to do
one is to dream
two is loving you

(after solo, repeat second verse and vamp out)---Lyrics submitted by Aloyce.
