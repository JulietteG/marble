Sky, so vast is the sky
With far away clouds just wandering by
Where do they go?  Oh, I don't know, don't know

Wind that speaks to the leaves
Telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love....belong to you ....and me

Oh, Dindi
If I only had words, I would say 
All beautiful things that I see
When you're with me, oh my Dindi

Oh, Dindi
Like the song of the wind in the trees
That's how my heart is singing Dindi
Happy Dindi, when you're with me

I love you more each day
Yes, I do ......Yes, I do
I'd let you go away
If you'd take me with you

Don't you know, Dindi
I'd be running and searching for you
Like a river that can't find the sea
That would be me without you.....my Dindi


I love you more each day
Yes, I do ......Yes, I do
I'd let you go away
If you'd take me with you

Don't you know, Dindi
I'd be running and searching for you
Like a river that can't find the sea
That would be me without you.....my Dindi---Lyrics submitted by Denise.
