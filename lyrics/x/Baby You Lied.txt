You got lost in the dark last night
The road was empty
Sittin in your car you saw a black and white
doin a hundred and twenty

Baby, you lied when you loved me
To you the whole thing was a fake
And now youre stuck out in the wilderness
In the middle of a big mistake
Baby, you lied, I even understand why
Im lookin at a candy bar you left behind
Ill make you be forgiven
Baby, you lied

You smelled like shit this mornin
But refused to crawl back home
A black snake never moves backwards
You both will spend your life alone

Baby, you lied when you left me
Another line in your private joke
I hope you had a good time watchin
Your life go up in smoke

Baby, you lied, I even understand why
Im watchin a musical monkey unwind
Hopin to be forgiven
Baby, you lied

Your car broke down, you sat for an hour
Chewin on your hand
You fix it yourself, its not your fault
That the world is so unfair

Baby, you lied on Sunday
Workin on the day of rest
The fact that I could lead you
Proves that youre no best
Baby, you lied, I even understand why
Lipstick and Gideons, runaway signs
Wasted livin
Baby, you lied.  Uh, baby, you lied.  Baby, you lied.---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
