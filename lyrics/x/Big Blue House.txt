The sun is down behind the Safeway
The snow is pink on a mountain
The black and white dog is under the table
Spaghetti is boilin on the burner

Would you please stop listenin to your eyes crackin open
Would you please stop watchin the sound of your heart in the mirror

In the big blue house, in the big blue house

I dont want to scatter your ashes
The floor is dirty enough as it is
And I dont want to speak of you kindly
Besides the phone is upstairs

Would you please stop wishin that you could stop wishin
That you could float out of your life like a cloud

In the big blue house, in the big blue house
In the big blue house

Calm down,   calm way down

Everythings gonna be all right, everything gonna be all right
In the big blue house

Would you please stop wishin that you could stop wishin
That you could float out of your life like a cloud

In the big blue house, in the big blue house
In the big blue house

Everythings gonna be all right, everything gonna be all right
In the big blue house, in the big blue house
In the big blue house, in the big blue house---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
