SUCK SUCK by X Australia (Lyrics by Steve Lucas)

Its really very simple and its not that hard to do
Just try and use the people like theyre trying to use you
Compromise your politics thats all youll ever need
If youre gonna suck suck suck suck suck suck suck succeed

If youre gonna suck suck suck suck suck suck suck succeed

It's anywhere and everywhere, what you're prepared to do. 
You stuff the guts of business men so they can shit on you.
It's really very civil and it's not hard to believe,
If youre gonna suck suck suck suck suck suck suck succeed

If youre gonna suck suck suck suck suck suck suck succeed

So cut your hair, wash your face, keep your image clean
Try to be well spoken when they ask you where youve been
Its really very civil and its not hard to believe
If youre gonna suck suck suck suck suck suck suck succeed

If youre gonna suck suck suck suck suck suck suck succeed
