Please talk to me the way you did
When it was summer
Grass has turned from brown to green months ago
Hang your heart on the heart of a deer
Shoot it from a distance
Love doesnt fly with the wave of her hand         like it used to
Hail the size of marbles fly
flood in Texas

We sing a song and get gone night long
To a heart broken melody
You got a letter, so did I
Didnt say who and it didnt say why
Talkin on the phone or in the street
You get the feelin someones watchin me

Someones watchin you.    Someones watchin me.
Someones watchin you.    Someones watchin me.
Someones watchin me.

Maybe as soon as early next year
We could lose our bodies
For the greatest national fighting machine
Stands the winner

We merely scrambled words up, the last official letter
You got a letter, so did I
Didnt say who and it didnt say why
Every minute of every day
You better watch out what you say

Well, someones watchin you.    Someones watchin me.
Someones watchin you.    Someones watchin me.
Someones watchin me.    Someones watchin me.---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
