I am the hungry wolf 
and run endlessly with my mate 
I see the gutter feed on the foolish 
outrun and kill the strong
at daybreak I roam awake to who follows me 
I roam, I roam...

I am the hungry wolf 
and run endlessly with my mate 
welcome to the dripping jaws 
the alter of your death 
at daybreak I roam ready to tear up the world 
I roam, I roam...

The hungry wolf stares from the hill 
at the villagers around the fire 
she loves her mate as he loves her 
and they live together for life 

I am the hungry wolf and run endlessly with my mate 
look across the street, my friend 
we're waiting for you to slow down 
at daybreak i roam eyes in the back of my head 
I roam, I roam...

The hungry wolf stares from the hill 
at the villagers around the fire 
she loves her mate as he loves her 
and they live together for life 

I am the hungry wolf and run endlessly with my mate 
look across the street, my friend 
we're waiting for you to slow down 
at daybreak i roam eyes in the back of my head 
I roam, I roam...---Lyrics submitted by Doug West.
