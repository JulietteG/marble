The wind still blows
God knows how many people are buying tuxedos
People still washin cars
Could this be a country at war?

Leaves turn green, the fever breaks.
Leaders never confess their hate
Even alone under the stars
Could this be a country at war?
Could this be a country at war?

Spit still hits the sidewalk
Someone still irons his ties
People still hardly wait in bars
Could this be a country at war?
Could this be a country at war?
Could this be a country at war?

I try to love this country, but its turned its back
On its sick and hungry, its tired and poor
This must be a country at war
This must be a country at war

Freeway palm trees blazing, TV stations pick up ratings
People out looting stores
This must be a country at war
This must be a country at war
This must be a country at war---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
