My hands shake
'Cause today
I know
your gonna' break my heart and
My life without you in it
is a life that's not worth livin
I'll be strong,
but I wish I was someone else,
anyone but me
tonight

Here I stand (here i stand)
all alone (here i stand)
tonight, (here i stand)
I wish that I was strong enought to breathe, (here i stand)
without you (here i stand)
in my life (here i stand)
I wish the I was anyone but me

So I'll start
to pretend
I'm OK
but you should know by now that
my life is smoke and mirrors,
one thing is crystal clear:
that I'm the one
wishing i was someone was someone else
anyone but me
tonight

Here i stand (here i stand)
all alone (here i stand)
tonight (here i stand)
i wish that i was strong enough to breathe (here i stand)
without you (here i stand)
in my life (here i stand)
i wish that i was anyone but me

(where do we go?)
(where do we go?)

Inside i start to fall apart (where do we go?)
and i'll pretend i'm holding on (where do we go?)
I guess i'll bleed in silence (in silence)
i guess i'll bleed in silence!

here i stand (here i stand)
all alone (here i stand)
tonight, (here i stand)
i wish that i was strong enought to breather (here i stand)
without you (here i stand)
in my life (here i stand)
i wish that i was anyone but me

all alone (here i stand)
tonight, (here i stand)
i wish that i was strong enough to breathe (here i stand)
without you (here i stand)
in my life (here i stand)
i wish that i was anyone but me...---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
