Another weekend comes, I got nowhere to go
So get real high and head to your window
Watch perfect faces living perfect lives
'Til something snaps inside.

Now everything looks just like a horror cartoon
And I'm thinking of something that I know I shouldn't do
But nobody knows me and nobody cares
And damn, I feel alive.

You think you know who we are.
Well, you don't know us at all.

We are criminals
The arsonists, the thieves, the rapists.
Save yourself.
You put us in cages but you made us criminals.
Lost inside your american dreams,
We'll carry this for the quarantine.

Now I'm running away
Just like a clumsy? machine
And a memory follows like a horrible dream
But I prove to myself I can do anything
And damn, I feel alive

We are criminals
The arsonists, the thieves, the rapists.
Save yourself.
You put us in cages but you made us criminals.
Lost inside the american dream,
We'll carry this for the quarantine.

For every town that I've been lied to,
Been cheated, beaten down,
Revenge is such a glamorous feeling
I've been craving for so long.
And when you sleep at night,
Believe me, I'll be there in the dark
'Cause we've got nothing to lose
And we don't care who you are.

The rich, the beautiful
You don't mean a thing to a scorched earth.
Parasites in paradise,
Our time has come to change your life.

We are criminals
The arsonists, the thieves, the rapists.
Save yourself.
You put us in cages, but you made us.

The rich, the beautiful
You don't mean a thing to a scorched earth.
Parasites in paradise,
Our time has come to change your life.

The disenchanted, we revolution to change your life.
We're now at war with our future.---Lyrics submitted by Khush.
