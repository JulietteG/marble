Sometimes I feel like I'm from another world,
And everything I want in life seems impossible.
Cause people they'll tear you apart.
But in the bottom of our hearts,
The dream's alive inside.
And we won't forget...

So we say...

You can't break, can't change, can't take us down.
(We run this town)
We'll stand, we'll fight, set fires all night.
(You'll never take us alive...)
Wa oh oh oh oh oh...
Wa oh oh oh oh oh...
(You'll never take us alive...)
Wa oh oh oh oh oh...
Wa oh oh ohhhhh...
(You'll never take us alive...)

For the last time I'll give myself to the enemy,
By letting their words just walk all over me.
Cause people they'll tear you apart,
If you are not like them.
And we are different.
Let the war begin.

So we say...

You can't break, can't change, can't take us down.
(We run this town)
We'll stand, we'll fight, set fires all night.
(You'll never take us alive...)
Wa oh oh oh oh oh...
Wa oh oh oh oh oh...
(You'll never take us alive...)
Wa oh oh oh oh oh...
Wa oh oh ohhhhh...
(You'll never take us alive...)

There's no fear inside.
This is our time, no giving up.
When we connect our hearts, to our minds,
There's no stopping us.

So we say...

You can't break, can't change, can't take us down.
(We run this town)
We'll stand, we'll fight, set fires all night.
(You'll never take us alive...)
Wa oh oh oh oh oh...
Wa oh oh oh oh oh...
(You'll never take us alive...)
Wa oh oh oh oh oh...
Wa oh oh ohhhhh...
(You'll never take us alive...)---Lyrics submitted by Khush.
