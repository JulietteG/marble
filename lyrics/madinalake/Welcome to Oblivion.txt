On an island out in the sea,
I wouldn't care what they think of me,
But in this crowded room, I believe
That I'm seconds from insanity.

'Cause her eyes just rip me all apart,
And my temperamental mind decides that I'm being a man.

Welcome to oblivion,
Where panic starts to settle in.
Welcome to oblivion,
Oh, I think I'm losing it.

So many voices, I can't even sleep,
Typical in night company.
They ask questions about my life,
"Where is he going?"
Who am I?
And those voices rip me all apart.
I need medicine to quiet and to find it.

Welcome to oblivion,
Where panic starts to settle in
And I'm afraid of everything.
Oh, I lost my head again.

Welcome to oblivion,
Where my whole life is caving in
And I can't stand who I am.
Oh, I think I'm losing it.

I lost my head again.

Then I met you.
You were standing all alone 'cause you felt it too.
The world has broken you down.
You and me are gonna make it through
'Cause now we know there's people like us.

As I fall apart inside,
All of my thoughts collide,
And that's no way to live a life.
Oh, I think I'm losing it.

Welcome to oblivion,
Where panic starts to settle in
And I'm afraid of everything.
Oh, I lost my head again.

Welcome to oblivion,
I gotta get off the medicine
'Cause I can't stand who I am.
Oh, I think I'm losing it.---Lyrics submitted by Khush.
