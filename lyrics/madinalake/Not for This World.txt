I woke up to a dream passing by.
It was the middle of the night.
Was I awake? Was I asleep?
What was I doing outside?
I saw a man walk from the trees
He came and sat next to me
He said, "Boy, if you don't follow your dreams,
You'll be dead someday. Just like me."
Then he got up and walked away
And I started to think.
He turned around, I saw his face
And I looked deep in his eyes,
And I realized that man was me.

You're not for this world,
This world is for you
And now is the time.
(There's no tomorrow!)
So make the most of every day
While you're alive
(Stand for something!)

I contemplate my every day
And everything I've been afraid to change.
Never good enough, (promptly too late?),
Always excuses away.
I used to think if I never tried,
I would never fail.
Now I realize, I can do anything.

You're not for this world,
This world is for you
And now is the time.
(There's no tomorrow!)
So make the most of every day
While you're alive
(Stand for something!)

Too little too late
And then you die
And no one even knows your name.
Don't let your light fight from your heart
Your heart gives you the best advice.

Believe!
Believe!

You're not for this world,
This world is for you
And now is the time.
(There's no tomorrow!)
So make the most of every day
While you're alive
(Stand for something!)

For what you believe.
For what you believe...---Lyrics submitted by Khush.
