When I'm afraid the better days are never coming again.
I imagine your face, and I keep on moving.
I'm bound to cry, destined to fly.
And guaranteed to die.
But till the end I've got your face.
And I keep on moving.

I lost my mom when I was only twelve.
I was robbed with a gun when I was twenty-one.
I crashed my car when I was drunk again.
And now, got no friends got no money.
But I keep on learning.

You can build a life and have it broken down.
You can chose a path and get turned around.
You can hate yourself and fall in love again.
As for me, I've lost friends lost lovers.
But I still got my soul.

When I'm afraid the better days are never coming again.
I imagine your face, and I keep on moving.
I'm bound to win I'm bound to loose.
And all the way I have to choose.
Sometimes it's right more times it's wrong.
[ Madina Lake Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]
But I keep on moving.

You can build a life and have it broken down.
You can chose your path and get turned around
You can hate yourself and fall in love again.
As for me, I've lost friends, lost lovers.
But I still got my soul.

In a journey through my head.
I stumble on a mess.
The bad things from my past.
Are buried not dead.

They haunt you like ghosts.
Begging me to let 'em go.
But they make me who I am.
And I wouldn't change anything.

You can build a life and have it broken down.
You can chose a path and get turned around.
You can hate yourself and fall in love again.
As for me, I've lost friends lost lovers.
But I still got my soul 
But I still got my soul 
But I still got my soul...---Lyrics submitted by Khush.
