It's late at night the world's asleep 
And I'm trying not to think 
I take some pills cause my mind bleeds 
I'm thinking what is wrong with me 
Because the only thing I know about honesty 
Is every lie I told that you believed 

I'm afraid, to be alone 
I'm afraid, that one day you'll find out 

And you'll be amazed 
At the secrets I keep 
You'll be amazed 
At my mouth full of lies 
But I'm too afraid to come clean 
Cause my life's the flame in a house of cards 

Now I can't look you in your eyes 
Because the guilt is killing me 
I try disconnect my heart again 
Just so I can breathe 
I wanna be myself again 
But I just can't cause 

I'm afraid, to be alone 
I'm afraid, that one day you'll find out 

And you'll be amazed 
At the secrets I keep 
You'll be amazed 
At my mouth full of lies 
But I'm too afraid to come clean 
Cause my life's the flame in a house of cards 

It's such a shame what I've become 
After years of breaking down 
My whole life has come undone 
Cause I'm trying to fake it all 
And I know that you love someone 
But that someone isn't me 
Or is this me? 
No 

And you'll be amazed 
At the secrets I keep 
You'll be amazed 
At my mouth full of lies 
But I'm too afraid to come clean 
Cause my life's the flame in a house of cards 

You'll be amazed 
You'll be amazed---Lyrics submitted by Leah.
