I just need something that will take me away 

I'd throw my heart into your fire, when i was blind 
And you knew that I'd come crawling back, and you knew you'd always find me there 
But this time some things are gonna change, I'm breakin out 
And I know someday I'll be ok, and I know someday I'll stand again 

But this won't be the end of me 
Cuz I'm breakin away 

I just need something that will take me away 
To help me disconnect to get you off my mind 
I just need something that will give me the strength to get away from you 
To escape from here 

And as I'm sifting through the ash, I find myself 
And you knew that I'd come crawling back, and you knew you'd always find me there 
But I'm sure you're never gonna change, cuz you've learned this all before 
And I know that you'll come crawling back, but I swear you'll never find me there 

I just need something that will take me away 
To help me disconnect to get you off my mind 
I just need something that will give me the strength to get away from you 
To escape from here 

What was I waiting for, The years went flying by me 
And I can't ever get them back 
What was I afraid of, I just want to live my life while I'm still alive 
Cuz I'm still alive 

I just need something that will make me numb 
To help me dissapear, to anywhere but here 

You'll break away 

I just need something that will take me away 
To help me disconnect to get you off my mind 
I just need something that will give me the strength to get away from you 
To escape from here 

For now I'm fine, for now I just want to live my life while I'm alive 
For now I'm fine, for now I just want to live my life while I'm alive---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
