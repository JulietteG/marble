The way you dance it turns me on
but you know that i'm spoken for
the way your sweat drips off your chest
you know that i'm wanting more

the lies the sex the heat this sweat
and nothing else matters
you call my name without your dress

i already forgot her
you have no idea what you do to me
and you, you have no idea what your doing to me

pandora, i don't know how you carved your way into my heart
and i don't know how you snuck your way into my house
but i know that i'll regret what i did
and i know i'll regret it forever as i throw my life away, pandora

the girl i love sits at home and i know that shes lonely
but i'm watching you take off your clothes
your the star of this movie
the love the hate the guilt my fate is hanging in the balance
you have no idea what you do to me
oh you don't even care what you mean to me

pandora, i don't know how you carved your way into my heart
and i don't know how you snuck your way into my house
but i know that i'll regret what i did
and i know i'll regret it forever as i throw my life away, pandora

and by the time that i come home shes already sleeping
sit on the bed and take off my clothes
my nerves their shaking
the lies the sex the heat this sweat
your body is quaking
the love the hate the guilt my fate
against this temptress

pandora, i don't know how you carved your way into my heart
and i don't know how you snuck your way into my house
but i know that i'll regret what i did
and i know ill regret it forever as i throw my life away (forever as i throw my life away)
forever as i throw my life away, pandora---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
