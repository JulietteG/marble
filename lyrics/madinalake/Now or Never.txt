too long in the same place
i'm sinking into this town
i've charmed the same old snakes
i think we gotta get out
before i break away form me 
cause this place is my lobotomy
imagine we were dead
counting all the things we never did 
i remember when you told me
i should live like i'm dying 
and not to close my eyes while everything burns
what are we waiting for?
these years are dying slowly
today is still in front of us
and we're breaking out 
cause today is now or never
i can't contemplate the earth 
all while my head's in the sand 
cause i've been buried alive
so take my bleeding hands
and breath life into me 
cause right now i'm suffocating
so imagine we were dead 
counting all the things we never did
i remember when you told me
i should live like i'm dying
and not to close my eyes while everything burns
what are we waitng for?
these years are dying slowly
today is still in front of us
and we're breaking out cause today is now or never 
i don't want a life of agony
i won't be another tragedy
and close my eyes while everything burns
and i won't pretend i don't exist 
invisible until i turn to dust 
open your eyes we're still alive
standing still is criminal and never lasts forever
the safest place in life is now 
today's the day we're breaking out
i remember when you told me
i should live like i'm dying 
and not to close my eyes while everything burns
what are we waiting for?
these years are dying slowly 
today is still in front of us 
and we're breaking out cause today is now or never---Lyrics submitted by maria.
