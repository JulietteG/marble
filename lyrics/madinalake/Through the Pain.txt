On the Chicago River after dark
We watch the city lights tear the sky apart
The wind was blowing her hair around
As the scenery explodes, I'll tell you how

I fell into an old cliche
Always on the road, only halfway sane
No hospital can fix what I've become.

I've trapped myself in a ring of fire.
If I say I'm okay, I'm also a liar.
The only way out is through the pain.
(How am I gonna get through this?)

I got so low that I get high
Just to sit and watch the miles go by.
Now I'm cold and sweaty with a nauseous heart
I got a million addictions wearing me down.
I fell into an old cliche
Always on the road only halfway sane
No hospital can fix what I've become.

I've trapped myself in a ring of fire.
If I say I'm okay, I'm also a liar.
The only way out is through the pain.

And as I write these words, my hands start to shake
With trouble sneaking in not a second too late.
The only way out is through the pain.
Tomorrow I'll start again.

And now I'm begging for help
I know I can't get up
Gotta face this one all alone.
And if I don't make it,
Remember that I'll always be a part of you.

I've trapped myself in a ring of fire.
If I say I'm okay, I'm also a liar.
The only way out is through the pain.

And as I write these words, my hands start to shake
With trouble sneaking in not a second too late.
The only way out is through the pain.
Tomorrow I'll start again.---Lyrics submitted by Khush.
