They say the darkest hour's just before the dawn.
Well, I've been up all night just desperate for the sun.
'Cause I've got a voice or two that can't seem to forget you.
They keep me up all night no matter what I do.

All these images surrounding me
Over you in my head as I lay still,
But the silent voices kill.

They won't shut up.
There's so much noise inside my head.
They won't give up.
I can't get away from myself.
I don't wanna meet someone new,
I just wanna be over you.

The past is a noose that you have tied my life up to.
Now I'm obsessed, I'm sick, I'm desperate, I can't move.

All these images surrounding me
Over you in my head as I lay still,
But the silent voices kill.

They won't shut up.
There's so much noise inside my head.
They won't give up.
I can't get away from myself.
I don't wanna meet someone new,
I just wanna be over you.

They don't give up.
I can't even hear myself.

They won't shut up.
There's so much noise inside my head.
They won't give up.
I can't get away from myself.
I don't wanna meet someone new,
I just wanna be over you.---Lyrics submitted by Khush.
