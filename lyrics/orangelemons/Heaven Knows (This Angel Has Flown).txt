There are times when I'm lying in my bed 
Hug my pillow and cry from this tip again 
And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day 
Almost rubbed down, swelling, as I keep on 
Dipping my face in these cold hands of mine 
Heaven knows how bitter I am 

Chorus 
'Cause this angel has flown away from me 
Leaving me in drunken misery 
I should have clipped her wings and made her mine 
For all eternity 
Now this angel has flown away from me 
Thought I had the strength to set her free 

Did what I did because I love her so 
Will she ever find her way back home to me 
Aah 

I'm so tired, I feel like catching forty winks 
Being up all night in this elbow room 
That puts me in a trance 
Where hopes and dreams come true 
Now my lips are burning and my eyes are hurting 
From this fuse I mixed till I light another 
Cigarette just to pass my time, oh 
Heaven knows how bitter I am 

(Repeat chorus)---
