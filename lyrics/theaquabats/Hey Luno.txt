Look at you 
well i could see someone in there
that would like to be
the happiest clam on the beach 

But look at you 
you're the angry clown
who tries to push all the kids around
But there's a flying horse who could change that course

Hey hey hey, hey luno
Hey hey hey, hey luno

[Chorus]
Well can he stop the enemy?
(we only believe in what we see)
Well, he could do it, you never know
(oh, we don't know)
Hey hey hey, hey luno
Hey hey hey, hey luno

Why can't you just call his name 
then luno could come down 
and take you far away to the land of the same

Then you'll see how fun it is 
that flying horse was true 
when you're stuck in a world with people
just as sad as you, as you

Hey luno, hey luno

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by micaela.
