Were going to the moon!
Were gonna get there soon!
But whats the point
Now were here and
Theres nothing to do
Its just craters and sand!
A desolation wasteland!
Something must be done!
To make this lunar landing fun!

Lets have a food fight
Here on the moon
Theres nothing better
Than having a food fight
Here on the moon
Light as a feather
In zero gravity
You are my enemy
Having a food fight on the moon

So lets raid the ship
For Oreos And chips!
Weve got powdered juice-a
And bags of stew
That well cut loose-a
Fo sho its on
Spaghetti-Os and Grey Poupon
But its all okay
No cleanup
The food just floats away

Lets have a food fight
Here on the moon
Theres nothing better
Than having a food fight
Here on the moon
Light as a feather
In zero gravity
You are my enemy
Having a food fight on the moon

Whats the point of going to space anyway?
Theres nothing but space out here
I think you know
I think you know why Bowie and Major Tom
They went to space to get their food fight on
To get their food fight on!
They went to get their food fight on!

Lets have a food fight
Here on the moon
Theres nothing better
Than having a food fight
Here on the moon
Light as a feather
In zero gravity
In zero gravity
You are my enemy
'Cause we're having a food fight on the moon

in space---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
