As one sits and waits for something to happen
I too sat and waited for you to call
Well, I waited too long and I thought
hey maybe I should call you
But by then, you had already gone

Oh Woah Its Friday night, I wanted to go out 
I didn't want to go to no show
Didn't want to cruise main street
I didn't want to go to no disco (no no)
I just wanted you to come over
sit on the couch and hold me tight
But you went out with some dumb jock and left me alone with my skateboard tonight

Now I'm out on MY SKATEBOARD
and I'm pushing so hard
I'm pushing so hard
I want to see if I can see if you're still home
But the lights aren't on and you were gone
So on my way home, alone
I took a short cut through the park
And just my luck I saw you sitting in his truck
you were making out with him in the dark!

Oh Woah Its Friday night, I wanted to go out 
I didn't want to go to no show
Didn't want to cruise main street
I didn't want to go to no disco (no no)
I just wanted you to come over
sit on the couch and hold me tight
But you went out with some dumb jock and left me alone with MY SKATEBOARD tonight

Why'd you go and change your mind?
You can pick and choose but with him
you're gonna loose every time.

Its Friday night, I wanted to go out 
I didn't want to go to no show
Didn't want to cruise main street
I didn't want to go to no disco (no no)
I just wanted you to come over
sit on the couch and hold me tight
But you went out with some dumb jock and left me alone with MY SKATEBOARD tonight---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
