There's too many people living in my house
I can see them, I don't know them
And I want them out!
There's too much emphasis on dirt
Who did what for how long?
And where does it hurt?

I think
Oh No! How did it get so far?
Do you! Have to walk with a lean?
Oh no! I need a vacation from waving checkered flags at the Malibu Grand Prix

What are we doing here?
What are we doing now?
What are we doing here?
I know!

Line up the rickshaws
Right down the derby line
Let's all crash into each other
It's demolition time
Line up the rickshaws
Right down the derby line
Let's all crash into each other
It's demolition time
Right now, Right Now!

There's too many choices staring back at me
I can see them
I don't know them,
Now I must leave!
There's too much pressure on my seams
Just drink a little water chemicals attack blood streams

I think
Oh No! How did it get so far?
Do you! Have to walk with a lean?
Oh no! I need a vacation from waving checkered flags at the Malibu Grand Prix

What are we doing here?
What are we doing now?
What are we doing here?
I know!

Line up the rickshaws
Right down the derby line
Let's all crash into each other
It's demolition time
Line up the rickshaws
Right down the derby line
Let's all crash into each other
It's demolition time
Right now, Right Now!

Come on, come on, come on, everybody
Come on, come on, come on, Demolition Rickshaw
Come on, come on, come on, everybody
Come on, come on, come on, Demolition Rickshaw
Come on, come on, come on, everybody
Come on, come on, come on, Demolition Rickshaw

Line up the rickshaws
Right down the derby line
Let's all crash into each other
It's demolition time
Line up the rickshaws
Right down the derby line
Let's all crash into each other
It's demolition time!---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
