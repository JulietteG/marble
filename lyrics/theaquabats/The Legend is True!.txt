I like your face and you like mine too
I like your face and you like mine too
Your looks are legend
And the legend is true
I like your face and you like mine too

Stereo's on but nobody's dancing
No one knows what they're talking about
There is no Golden Age fashion
At least not in this town

So when I turned my head to cry
I had to dry my eye
I saw the tortoise from the sea
Swimming you back to me

And there across the sky
I can see what makes the legend
The legend is true
And it's you
Yeah, you are the legend
The legend is true

I like your fangs and you like mine too
I like your fangs and you like mine too
That bite is legend
And the legend is true
I like your fangs and you like mine too

It's been so long since rust made a racket
All the friars like to rock 'n' roll
But there underneath the dust jacket
That's where the legend will go

And as I turned my head to cry
I had to dry my eye
I saw the tortoise from the sea
Swimming you back to me

And there across the sky
I can see what makes the legend
The legend is true
And it's you
Yeah, you are the legend
The legend is true
So that is why I cry
I can see what takes a mention
The legend is true
And it's you
Yeah, you are the legend
The legend is true

In the stagecoach on the highway
Will you be a-going my way?
Forsooth!
In the cottage on the green
Through the castle of the queen
Quite right!
Lords and ladies clap and sing
As raven clips his broken wing
Indeed!
So on a fortnight journeys sting
Ask yourself do you like tings?
(Me like tings!)

And there across the sky
I can see what makes the legend
The legend is true
And it's you
Yeah, you are the legend
The legend is true
So that is why I cry
I can see what takes a mention
The legend is true
And it's you
Yeah, you are the legend
The legend is true

And it's you
Yeah, you are the legend
The legend is true---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
