Out of the sky
The Floating Eye
Will prophecy and pretend
That this is the end

The people run,
Run to the hills
Run for their lives to flee
The horrible eye

(This was the dream) I heard the screams
(This was the dream) to build a giant robot, we'll call him birdhead
(This was the dream) Don't cross the streams
(Jumbo machine) Can launch a rocket punch into the eye!

The giant robot with bird-like head
The giant robot he is our friend
Some chollos want to point the gun
but we've got the 3-2-1!

Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire! Now we're talkin'
It's out of hand
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire! Now we're talkin'
It's out of hand

Oh oh
When it's in my hands
We've got missle command
Oh oh
Bird head's working now
We can watch it all fall down

Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down go boom 
Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down go boom

Jumbo machine
Shiny and clean
Who else can save the people
From the megaton punch?
Invincible
The guardian
Of careless men who
Run the world like a cartoon show

(Living the dream) I hear the screams
(Living the dream) To build my giant robot With giant birdhead
(This is the dream) Jumbo Machine
(Shiny and clean) we can face reality and fight

The giant robot with bird-like head
The giant robot he is my friend
Some chollos want to point the gun
but we've got the 3-2-1!

Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire! Now we're talkin'
It's out of hand
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire! Now we're talkin'
It's out of hand

Oh oh
When it's in my hands
We've got missle command
Oh oh
Bird head's working now
We can watch it all fall down

Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down go boom 
Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down
Kaboom! Fall down go boom

Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire! Now we're talkin'
It's out of hand
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire!
Now we're talkin'
Fire! Now we're talkin'
It's out of hand

Oh oh
When it's in my hands
We've got missle command
Oh oh
Bird head's working now
We can watch it all fall down---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
