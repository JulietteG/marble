Well I remember my first day at public school
I was very scared of getting pummeled
And sure enough I did at first recess
I got pegged in the head by a big red ball
It stung and my head hung
Back to class with a bloody nose
And soon it was lunchtime

Mom said I should ask about how poor kids can get fed
So I got a book of tickets and a schedule and it read:
Monday - Hot Dog, Tuesday - Taco
Wednesday - Hamburgers and Chocolate Milk
Thursday - Sloppy Joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was Pizza Day, the best day of the week
All the kids would line up super early just to eat

Monday - Hot Dog, Tuesday - Taco
Wednesday - Hamburgers and Chocolate Milk
Thursday - Sloppy Joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was Pizza Day, the best day of the week
It always came with salad and a side of cold green beans

Hooray for Pizza Day
Hooray for Pizza Day
I miss Pizza Day
The best day of the week

Well, I remember my first day in Jr. High
I had hairspray in my hair
And my pants were way too tight
And all the breakers and new wavers
And the rockers and the preps
Would all be in their places
On the front lawn or the steps
I hung out with some punker kids
Who used to make me laugh
I got thrown in the dumpster
By some rich kids near the caf?

As time went on we figured out
It was totally uncool
To eat the welfare lunch
Provided by the school
So in poser-punker fashion
We just mooched off all the kids
And lived off eating candy bars
And bags of nacho chips

Monday - Hot Dog, Tuesday - Taco
Wednesday - Hamburgers and Chocolate Milk
Thursday - Sloppy Joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was Pizza Day, the best day of the week
It always came with salad and a side of cold green beans

Hooray for Pizza Day
Hooray for Pizza Day
I miss Pizza Day
The best day of the week

Well now I'm out of school
And I don't have a job
(You're a slob!)
I just sit around all sweaty and lethargic
And I'm just thinking 'bout where it all went wrong
Why I can't concentrate
On anything but reruns
I wish I had some more stability
I wish I had somebody making lunch for me
I guess I miss the simple things in life
The thought of Pizza Day
I thought it was stupid then
But I wish I had it now
I miss my

Monday - Hot Dog, Tuesday - Taco
Wednesday - Hamburgers and Chocolate Milk
Thursday - Sloppy Joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was Pizza Day, the best day of the week
It always came with salad and a side of cold green beans


Monday - Hot Dog, Tuesday - Taco
Wednesday - Hamburgers and Chocolate Milk
Thursday - Sloppy Joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was Pizza Day, the best day of the week
It always came with salad and a side of cold green beans

Hooray for Pizza Day
Hooray for Pizza Day
I miss Pizza Day
The best day of the week!
says michael jackson of encino, california
when he's not at his little theme park
he's eatin pizza with the kids
oh boy moon walkers back
have a slice buddy
take off your glove first
you'll enjoy it more---Lyrics submitted by alex.
