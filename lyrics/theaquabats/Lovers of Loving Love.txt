Funny faces
In sunny places
Being in love it feels so great
And all I need is
Two ingredients:
My buttercup
And the perfect place

Me and you
Here's what we'll do
Walk hand-in-hand
Into Lovers Land, aah
You're the best
And I can't resist
A kiss on the lips aaah aaah

Don't talk
just watch the world go by
As we float away
In slow motion
So special
It's so special
You the girl I see
I am your boy to be

I'm so happy
I'm so happy
That I'm a boy and you're a girl alright
I'm so happy
I'm so happy
I'm overjoyed
We're gonna hang out tonight

I can't walk
Can't move
Because I'm paralyzed
By your love
And that's OK by me
I'm so happy
I'm so Happy
It's real great
We're lovers of loving love
Lovers of loving love

It's so hip
To give you a kiss
And taste cherry chapstick aaah
It's our secret,
Our little secret
We'll never tell
Don't talk
just watch the world go by
As we float away
In slow motion
So special
It's so special
You the girl I see
I am your boy to be

I'm so happy
I'm so happy
That I'm a boy and you're a girl alright
I'm so happy
I'm so happy
I'm overjoyed
We're gonna hang out tonight

I can't walk
Can't move
Because I'm paralyzed
By your love
And that's OK by me
I'm so happy
I'm so happy
It's real great
We're lovers of loving love
Lovers of loving love

Lovers of loving
Love it's love
It's love
It's love
It's love
It's love
We're dreaming of

Lovers of loving
Love it's love
It's love
It's love
It's love
It's lovers of loving love---Lyrics submitted by alexus.
