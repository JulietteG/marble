Here's something to think about,
When things go wrong all the time.
That luck can change like that high tide,
Bad things can soon turn out alright.

Misfortune, a tragedy;
I can't seem to mind.
Soon good will happen,
If you look you just might find.

So when, you think this is the end;
Good things are just around the bend.
Again, bad things are just a sign;
Good things will happen in due time.

And with each passing day,
So goes another life.
Everybody wants to live,
Some people want to die.

So close your eyes 'cause it's alright to say:
Hello, Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

So if this is to be our time,
Just think of what we left behind;
Will they say good of you to last,
Or lose the memory of you fast?

Forever and ever,
A wonderful thing.
Will someone be grateful for what we tried to bring?
It's late....
But just remember then,
This day will never come again!

Everybody wants to live,
Some people wait to die.

So close your eyes 'cause it's alright to say:
Hello, Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

Hello, Goodnight...
Hello, Goodnight...

Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Hello, goodnight.
Goodnight.---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
