I have small friend, who has a fat friend
who has a big friend, who gave birth to many friends
with our flashlights to the sky, we waited for them to land. 

I've got two tall friends, who know my small friend, 
who seem to have a problem with you.
They've got Roman candles, model rockets for the vandals 
who covered the lockers in glue.

CHORUS
We're on our way, here we go, we're gonna take over.
Set it off one last time. Here we come again!

We were strangers, and we were pilgrims, 
role-models of the family man.
Pioneers and patriarchs, patriots and matriarchs,
taking up the promised land. 

Our little army, we were commandos, 
gorillas with decoder rings.
We felt some opposition from some villains who were wishing
they could be cadets and kings. 

CHORUS
All systems go, soon the world will know 
the fury of attack, feel the wrath of the 
Super Rad,  Super Rad! 
All systems go, soon the world will know 
the fury of attack, feel the wrath of the 
Super Rad, Super Rad, Super Rad! (Super Rad!)

And if we die before the battle's through,
tell your mom, tell your dad, we were super rad.

CHORUS
All systems go, soon the world will know 
the fury of attack, feel the wrath of the 
Super Rad,  Super Rad! 
All systems go, soon the world will know 
the fury of attack, feel the wrath of  
Super Rad, Super Rad, Super Rad! 
All systems go, as we step into the octagon,
feel the wrath of mission codename
applesauce, applesauce, applesauce! (Super Rad!)---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
