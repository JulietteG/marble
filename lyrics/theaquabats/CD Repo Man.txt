CD Repo Man
He can go where I can't go
CD Repo Man
He'll infiltrate your stereo
CD Repo Man
He'll sneak up around the back
CD Repo Man
He'll get your CDs back

Some people who seem to
Call themselves my friends
Take my CDs
Then they all pretend
That they lost my music
But I've got a plan
To find the nearest pay phone and
call the Repo Man

CD Repo Man
He can go where I can't go
CD Repo Man
He'll infiltrate your stereo
CD Repo Man
He'll sneak up around the back
CD Repo Man
He'll get your CDs back

When CD Repo Man
That guy is on a roll
He'll jump through windows
To get back what the suckers stole
He looks tame, but
You know he will attack
He does his job
To get your CDs back

CD Repo Man
He can go where I can't go
CD Repo Man
He'll infiltrate your stereo
CD Repo Man
He'll sneak up around the back
CD Repo Man
He'll get your CDs back

When your possessions are gone
And something is wrong
There is action to take
Don't call him unless you're really ticked
Because there is no escape
He wears a suit, it looks like he's strapped
Don't mess with him
Or you'll get smacked
Don't steal my CDs
That don't make no sense
Because a Repo Man is always intense!
Hey!

CD Repo Man
He can go where I can't go
CD Repo Man
He'll infiltrate your stereo
CD Repo Man
He'll creep up around your back
CD Repo Man
He'll get your CDs back

CD Repo Man
He can go where I can't go
CD Repo Man
He'll infiltrate your stereo
CD Repo Man
He'll creep up around the back
CD Repo Man
He'll get your CDs back
