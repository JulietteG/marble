I like hanging with my friends
Talkin' 'bout my B.F.F.
Big Friends... Forever!

I got some gigantic friends
They are like family
I take 'em with me everywhere
To put heat on my enemies
They're my own defensive line
I call them the great wall of mine
Hang with them til dinner time
At the smorgasbord we don't wait in line

And if you knew them like I do
Then you would see
That you need a big friend too
There's safety in numbers
And when your numbers are this large
You can walk right through a fight
Cuz your big friends are in charge

I like hanging with my friends
Talkin' 'bout my B.F.F.
Big Friends... Forever!
I like hanging with my friends
Talkin' 'bout my B.F.F.
Big Friends... Forever!

Stand on their shoulders
To get your cat out of the tree
Use 'em as a beanbag chair
When you're watching your fat screen TV
Crowd surf me all the way to school
Splash all the water out of my pool
These jolly giants are never cruel
All big people are really cool

And if you knew them like I do
Then you would see
That you need a big friend too
Now they are a ton of fun
But they are closer to the sun
Their footsteps are so heavy
They get so hot
So hot and sweaty

I like hanging with my friends
Talkin' 'bout my B.F.F.
Big Friends... Forever!
I like hanging with my friends
Talkin' 'bout my B.F.F.
Big Friends... Forever!

Big friends are here today
Big friends are here to stay
Big friends don't go away
They're getting bigger, bigger every day

New York - Big Friends!
LA - Big Friends!
UK - Big Friends!
All The Islands - Big Friends!
And the chipmunks are our little friends
So don't step on them!!

I like hanging with my friends
Talkin' 'bout my B.F.F.
Big Friends... Forever!
I like hanging with my friends
Talkin' 'bout my B.F.F.
Big Friends... Forever!
I like hanging with my friends
Talkin' 'bout my B.F.F.
Big Friends... Forever!
I like hanging with my friends
Talkin' 'bout my B.F.F.
Big Friends... Forever!---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
