Science brings gifts of convenience
To the modern man
Modern man then continues
Continues to expand
But what happens when man creates
Something oh so wrong
Nature bites back in a big way
Good heavens what have I done!

I kept it in a box
I watched it grow a lot
It chewed right through the lock
And ate all the new kids on the block.

A scientist creates a beast
In a secret laboratory
Nature plots revenge
It's blood it seeks
That's where we begin our story!

The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa, the Cat with 2 Heads!
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa, the Cat with 2 Heads!

College brought education
To this privileged man
High school diploma
A science major
with a government grant
Four years later an experiment
To mutate domestic pets
It turned into a nightmare
So lock your doors
Hide your hot dogs
This cat's upset

I kept it in a box
I watched it grow a lot
It chewed right through the lock
And ate all the new kids on the block.

Society's been so good to me
My parents paid for my college education
Majoring in biotechnology
Created a beast and now it's after me!

I was in my laboratory
Creating what I thought would be...
Well...
Something great for the World
A two headed cat!
You could pet one kitty's head
Then pet the other kitty's head
But little did I know the power of Atomic Energy
Would create
A two headed
Man-Eating Monster!

The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa, the Cat with 2 Heads!
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa, the Cat with 2 Heads!
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa, the Cat with 2 Heads!
The Cat with 2 Heads
Whoa, the Cat with 2 Heads!

Two heads..... of terror!---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
