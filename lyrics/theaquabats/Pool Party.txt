Pool party baby
It was a cool party
Cool pool party
La la la la
Pool party baby
It was a cool party
Cool pool party
La la la la

Popcorn, hot dog buns, and hamburger patties
All the food you need to feed the many hungry
Millions of people want in to my party
But it's invite only
And you're on the list baby

-Your pool rips!
I cleaned it yesterday
-Girls look cute!
In their swimming suits
-Holy Guacamole!
We've got chips!
So come on take a dip
'Cause my pool rips

It was a pool party for the cool kids at my school
It was a pool party for the cool kids at my school
It's so cool in my pool
It's so cool in my pool
It's so cool in my pool
It's so cool in my pool
Yeah yeah yeah

Pool party baby
It was a cool party
Cool pool party
La la la la
Pool party baby
It was a cool party
Cool pool party
La la la la

The ratio of girls to guys is five to one
There hasn't been a party like this since 1981
Come to my party let the games begin
We've even got floaties if you can't swim

-Your pool rips!
I cleaned it yesterday
-Girls look cute!
In their swimming suits
-Holy Guacamole!
We've got chips!
So come on take a dip
'Cause my pool rips

It was a pool party for the cool kids at my school
It was a pool party for the cool kids at my school
It's so cool in my pool
It's so cool in my pool
It's so cool in my pool
It's so cool in my pool
Yeah yeah yeah

I love you girl, you know it's true
To have a super party in my swimming pool
Jump on in and you will see
Just how fun a pool party can be
But don't eat too much before you swim
'Cause you might get a cramp under your chin
Someone's screaming, that's not cool
Who threw that Reggie Bar in the pool?
Ronnie, Sally, Bobby and Mike
It's my pool party, we'll do what we like!

It was a pool party for the cool kids at my school
It was a pool party for the cool kids at my school
It's so cool in my pool
It's so cool in my pool
It's so cool in my pool
It's so cool in my pool
There's no pool at my school
There's no school in my pool
There's no pool at my school
So it's cool at my pool
Yeah yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
