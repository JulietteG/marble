Hey Homies! (What's up?)
What was that? (Clap Clap)
We don't need no thugs, unless those thugs was giving out hugs.
Hey Ladies! (What's up?)
What was that? (Say Whaat?)
We don't need no thugs, unless those thugs was giving out hugs.

Here we go again my friends
wave your hands from side to side (Whee! )
There's a roof we call the sky.
There's a special way to show that we care. 
Is there anybody out there? (I'm there! Me too! )
I'm talkin' bout hugs. H-U-G-S HUGS! 

Hey Homies! (What's up?)
What was that? (Clap Clap)
We don't need no thugs, unless those thugs was giving out hugs.
Hey Ladies! (What's up?)
What was that? (Say whaat?)
We don't need no thugs, unless those thugs was giving out hugs.

Ok, Ok. So where my ladies at? (Whatcha want? I'm here! )
And where my dudes at? (Uuuuh... Here?)
Now sisters and brothers, 
let's turn and face each other, 
and put your arms out nice and wide.
(ROCK THAT HUG! ) From side to side! 
(We be huggin'! ) Now give a hug to the right! 
(We be huggin'! ) And give a hug to the left! 
(We be huggin'! ) Now 360 hug! (Wheee! ) And sing it THUGS! 

Hey Homies! (What's up?)
What was that? (Clap clap)
We don't need no thugs, unless those thugs was giving out hugs.
Hey ladies! (What's up?)
What was that? (Say whaat?)

H is for Homies hugging huggers who is hot.
U is for you my bro can I get a hug or not?
G is for... Good hug... guy... UGH! 
Cuz huggin makes a sticky glue (Huh)
They form a bond you can't undo (Yeah)
So wrap your arms around this fun.
So many different hugs can be done! They can be done! 
Like the Bro hug, the Sandwich hug, the Zombie hug the T-Rex hug.
A Robot hug, the awkward hug, the Bear hug and THE GROUP HUG! 

Hey Homies! What was that? YOU WANNA HUG? (YEAH! )
We don't need no thugs (Yeah! ), unless those thugs was giving out hugs.
Hey Ladies! (What's up?)
What was that? (Say whaaat?)
We don't need no thugs, unless those thugs was giving out hugs.
Hey Homies! (What's up?)
What was that? (Clap clap)
We don't need no thugs, unless those thugs was giving out hugs.
Hey Ladies! (What's up?)
What was that? (Say whaaat?)
We don't need no thugs, unless those thugs was giving out hugs.---Lyrics submitted by Castel Lykaios.
