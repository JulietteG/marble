I was at the supermarket,
Watching people cut in line.
I started thinking about human nature,
What would you do if there was no more food?
My mind began to wander,
About greed and hunger,
And just how many other countries
Are getting ready for another war.

But the sun was shining,
And everything seems fine,
So count me in;
Ill see you on the other side.

Chemical bomb,
Chemical bomb;
Eyes melt, skin explodes, everybody dead.
It wont be long,
It wont be long,
People gonna run around losing their heads.
A river of blood,
Who's gonna live?
The earth is tired of human kind and I think this world,
Is gonna wash up in hell.

La la la la la
La la la la la,
La lala la la la la,

La la la la la
La la la la la,
La lala la la la la,

Then I had another vision,
In the crowded grocery store;
I saw the pale rider on his horse,
Decapitating people in the parking lot.
And all the shoppers were beasts,
What could I do to hide?
Back in this world of humankind,
I think we've already lost our minds.

But the sun was shining,
And everything seems fine,
So count me in.
Ill see you on the other side.

Chemical bomb,
Chemical bomb.
Eyes melt, skin explodes, everybody's dead.
It wont be long,
It wont be long,
People gonna run around losing their heads.
A river of blood,
Who's gonna live?
The earth is tired of human kind and I think this world,
Is gonna wash up in hell.

La la la la la
La la la la la,
La lala la la la la,
[Is gonna wash up in hell.]

La la la la la
La la la la la,
La lala la la la la,
[Is gonna wash up in hell.]

La la la la la
La la la la la,
La lala la la la la,
