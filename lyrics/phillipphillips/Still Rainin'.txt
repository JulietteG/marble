Clouds, one by one, fill the sky
Just like these tears that fill my eyes
I know by now she ain't comin' back
I watch my world slowly fade into black

Look out my window it's still rainin'
Look out my window it's still rainin'

They say that time heals everything
I've felt the pain that love can bring
It don't get no better with each passing day
Any hope I had is slowly slipping away

Look out my window, it's still rainin'
Look out my window, it's still rainin'

I thought the morning would rescue me
But the rain keeps falling endlessly, endlessly
Sometimes I wonder what'll become of me
There ain't much left of what I used to be
Her love shone on me like the morning light
Now here I am alone again tonight

Look out my window, it's still rainin'
Look out my window, it's still rainin' ---
