I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
When there's no one else around

I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
And do all things I told you in the midnight hour
Yes I am, yes I am
One more thing I just wanna say right here

I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
And see them twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait 'till the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine

You're the only girl I know
That can really love me so in the midnight hour
Oh yeah, in the midnight hour
Yeah, alright, play it for me one time now

I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait, wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine, just, you and I
Oh baby just, you and I
Nobody around baby, just, you and I, alright
You know what, I'm gonna hold you in my arms
Just, you and I, oh yeah in the midnight hour
Oh baby in the midnight hour---
