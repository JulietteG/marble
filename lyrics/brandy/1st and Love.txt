I ain't gettin' no younger 
So boy when I say love 
I don't say it just to say love 
I know better 
And if you never showed love 
Don't think I woulda known love 
Gotta put it in my song love 
And sing it over and over 

I told my mama that I love ya 
My brother asked me where I met ya 
Said I saw ya last Tuesday on the 
Corner of 1st and Love 
I heard ya 
Whistling my favorite song 
When I saw ya that morning 
On the corner of 1st and Love 

Right there 
Right there 
And I wanna sing it to the world 
He's right there 
Right there 
On the corner of 1st and Love 

My heart is beating like a bass drum 
I heard Cupid in my ear 
He said he never saw better 
I gave him a straight shot 
And it hit me like a moving truck 
Like an atom bomb 
But it never felt so good 

I told my mother that I love ya 
Bridget asked where I met ya 
Said I saw ya last Tuesday on the 
Corner of 1st and Love 
I heard ya 
Whistling my favorite song 
When I saw ya that morning 
On the corner of 1st and Love 

Right there 
Right there 
And I wanna sing it to the world 
He's right there 
Right there 
On the corner of 1st and Love 

This ain't serendipity 
No 
I know that it's meant to be 
Love 
Don't feel like luck to me 
No 
Know that it had to be love 
Like our names carved on a tree 
The memories inside of me 
Don't know how long forever is 
Would you stay with me 
And find out with me 
Oh if the sun don't rise for weeks 
Baby that's alright with me 
Can't add to infinity 
But if you stay with me 
You can count on me 

Right there 
Right there 
And I wanna sing it to the world 
He's right there 
Right there 
On the corner of 1st and Love 

I saw you by the street signs 
Oh I saw you by the street signs 
That read 1st and Love 
Love, love, love---Lyrics submitted by kendra.
