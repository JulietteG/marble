Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me.

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me.

Stars fading, but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn dear
Just saying this.

Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave your worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they'll be
Dream a little dream of me.

Stars fading, but I linger on dear
Still craving you kiss
I'm longing to linger 'til dawn dear
Just saying this...

Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave your worries far behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they'll be
Dream a little dream of me.

[scatting]

Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave your worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they'll be
Dream a little dream of me.
Sweet dreams...ooh la la la lah...sweet dreams---Lyrics submitted by Lori Colby.
