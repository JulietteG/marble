I'm on the battlefield
Like, oh my God (ooh la la)
Knocking soldiers down
Like house of cards (ooh la la)

I'm a one woman army (ooh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la)

I pull up in a matte black super car
Like Batman, yeah
No bodyguard
I'm Gangnam Styling on the bar
I got it, I bring all the boys to the yard
If you see me at the club in Hollywood
You know I bring that Detroit hood
You like it, and you feelin' good
You know that you want it
You know that you would

Let's rush tonight
The music is still playin'
So get up and fight
You know that you want it
You know that you would

I'm on the battlefield
Like, oh my God (ooh la la)
Knocking soldiers down
Like house of cards (ooh la la)
I'm a one woman army (ooh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la)

I'm on the battlefield
Like, oh my God (ooh la la)
Knocking soldiers down
Like house of cards (ooh la la)
I'm a one woman army (ooh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la)

I hit you with that kung-fu Jackie Chan
Boom, boom, boom, pow
I'm super fast
High heels, big deal
I kick your ass
They're gunnin', they're runnin'
And that makes me mad

If you wanna rumble
All you gotta do is ask
I'm a rude bitch, boy
Can you handle that?
I love to play
But I don't really need a man
No daddy, no VISA, I got my own cash

Let's rush tonight
The music is still playin'
So get up and fight
No daddy, no VISA, I got my own cash

I'm on the battlefield
Like, oh my God (ooh la la)
Knocking soldiers down
Like house of cards (ooh la la)
I'm a one woman army (ooh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la)

I'm on the battlefield
Like, oh my God (ooh la la)
Knocking soldiers down
Like house of cards (ooh la la)
I'm a one woman army (ooh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la)

One, two, three, hut
March if you don't give a fuck
One, two, three, hut
One, two, three, hut
March if you don't give a fuck
One, two, three, hut

I'm on the battlefield
Like, oh my God (ooh la la)
Knocking soldiers down
Like house of cards (ooh la la)
I'm a one woman army (ooh la la)
Yes, I'm a one woman army
(ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la)

I'm on the battlefield
Like, oh my God (ooh la la)
