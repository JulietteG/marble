(feat. Colonel Abrams)

Should I listen what you say
Or listen what your folks say?
It's a tough decision to make.
I don't really wanna lose you

But I don't want your folks to
Turn me over to the hands of the law.

I guess they think that I'm not good enough for you.
I can tell the way they act and their attitudes.
As the tears roll from my eyes I feel the hurt inside.
As I reach out to you saying I'm so confused.
Oh
Oh
I'm trapped
Like a fool I'm in a cage.
I can't get out
You see I'm trapped

Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out
You see I'm trapped

Like a fool I'm in a cage.
I can't get out
You see I'm trapped

Can't you see I'm so confused?
I can't get out!

If you love one another
Why should you let this go further?
Can't you see it's gonna pull us apart.
If you think I can't afford to
Support you if you want to

Ever think about ever settlin' down.

I guess they think that I'm not good enough for you. . . .

Can't you see I'm so trapped
And I don't know what to do.
Can't you see I'm so trapped. so in love with you.
See I'm trapped
And I'm so confused

I'm like a man in a cage
And I'm so in love with you.
I'm trapped
Your thoughts are in the way

And I don't know what to say
You see I'm trapped.
Oh
I told myself
If I ever love again

What am I gonna do about it? Say it again - trapped.

Oh
Baby
'I'm trapped - can't you see I'm so trapped?
I'm so confused - and I don't know what to do -
I'm like a man in a cage - can't you see I'm so trapped -
And I'm so in love with you
Love with
Love with you.
Oh
I'm trapped
Feel so confused
So impressed - trapped.
Hey
I'm so in love with you

Oh
I'm trapped
Baby
Oh
I'm trapped
Baby.
Oh
I'm trapped
Baby.
Can't you see I'm so trapped
and I don't know what to do.
Can't you see I'm so trapped
So in love with you.
I'm going out of my head
It seems I'm crazy for you.---
