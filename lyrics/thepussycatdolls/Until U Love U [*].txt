You know sometimes when you see yourself
That you see yourself
As someone not good enough
I know there times when you feel like 
You can't do nothing right

And then security takes a hold
Obscures your vision of your soul
You can't see what's inside
Open up your eyes

Take a look in the mirror 
Your Beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are 
Learn to except yourself
Cause it's the truth
Can't love nobody else 
Until U Love U

I know sometimes it's so hard to keep your self esteem
Sometimes you can feel so small
And it's so easy to tell yourself
Your not worth my shadow
When your unsure of who you are
And now it's tearing you apart
You can't see what is true
Change your point of view

Take a look in the mirror 
Your Beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are 
Learn to except yourself
Cause it's the truth
Can't love nobody else 
Until U Love U

Find what is real is what's inside
No, No there's no one else in this room like you
Take maybe just a little time to stop and see just who you really are

Take a look in the mirror 
Your Beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are 
Learn to except yourself
Cause it's the truth
Can't love nobody else 
Until U Love U

Take a look in the mirror 
Your Beautiful
Take a moment to love
The one you are 
Learn to except yourself
Cause it's the truth
Can't love nobody else 
Until U Love U

Take a look in the mirror
Take a look in the mirror
Take a look in the mirror
Take a look in the mirror
Your beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Joshua.
