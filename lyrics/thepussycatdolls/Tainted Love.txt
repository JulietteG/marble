Sometimes
I feel I've got to run away
I've got to get away
From the pain
You drove into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
I think I've lost my light
For I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
Give you all a girl could give you
Take my tears
And thats not nearly all

Tainted love
Tainted love

Now I know I've got to run away
I've got to get away
You don't really want anymore from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I run from you
This tainted love you've given
Give you all a girl could give you
Take my tears
And thats not nearly all

Tainted love
Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I can not stand it when you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
But I'm going to pack my things and go

Tainted love (Oh)
Tainted love (Tainted love)
Tainted love (Tainted love)
Tainted love
Tainted love!

Baby, baby
Baby, don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself
I've got this burning
Yearning, yearning
Feeling inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee
And now that I surrender
So helplessley
You Now Wanna Leave
Ooh, you want to meet me

Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Ooh there's a burning...---Lyrics submitted by cherrelle.
