"I dont think I want this anymore"
As she drops the ring to the floor
She says to herself "You've left before
This time you will stay gone, thats for sure"

And he shouted something as
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be
The time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car
She said

No..
Happily never after
That just aint for me because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall
As she drove away she starts to smile
Realized she hadn't for a while
No destination, she drove for miles
Wonderin' why she stayed in such denial

Laughing about the way he shouted something as
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be
The time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car
She said

No..
Happily never after
That just aint for me because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

I'm done , I'm done
Said I'm so done
So done, I'm done, I'm done
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
Free to be me

She inhales an air she'd never breathed before
The air of no drama, no more
She said

No..
Happily never after
That just aint for me because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

No..
Happily never after
That just aint for me because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

No..
Happily never after
That just aint for me because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall---Lyrics submitted by brianna.
