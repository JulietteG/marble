I see you over there looking like a millionaire 
Wind blowing through my hair making you wanna stare 
Come closer I want you, you can see it in my eyes 
I hope you're ready for the ride 

Bridge: 
Zoom zoom zoom ah 
The honesty in my eyes got you hypnotized 
Zoom zoom zoom ah 
I'mma give you a look you gon' memorize 

Chorus: 
Jump in my painted windows, baby lets go 
my eyes look like a picasso, let it all go 
jump in my painted windows, wanna see my soul 
I'll show ya I can love ya 

In the blink of an eye... Painted window 
In the blink of an eye... My painted windows 
In the blink of an eye... Painted window 
In the blink of an eye... My painted windows 
Ohh 

I got you so hot in a daze looking like a moron 
My hoods up gimmie a jump baby time to get me started 
Be careful don't let go somebody might scare you go 
You shouldn't let it come to this side 

Bridge: 
Zoom zoom zoom ah 
The honesty in my eyes got you hypnotized 
Zoom zoom zoom ah 
I'mma give you a look you gon' memorize 

Chorus: 
Jump in my painted windows, baby lets go 
my eyes look like a Picasso, let it all go 
jump in my painted windows, wanna see my soul 
I'll show ya I can love ya 

In the blink of an eye... Painted window 
In the blink of an eye... My painted windows 
In the blink of an eye... Painted window 
In the blink of an eye... My painted windows 
Ohh 

Affection in my eyes while I watch the way you move 
temptations no surprise I can't get enough of you... 

Jump in my painted windows baby lets go 
my eyes look like a Picasso let it all go 
jump in my painted windows Wanna see my soul 
I'll show ya I can love ya 

Jump in my painted windows baby lets go 
my eyes look like a Picasso let it all go 
jump in my painted windows Wanna see my soul 
I'll show ya I can love ya 

In the blink of an eye... Painted windows 
In the blink of an eye... My painted windows 
In the blink of an eye... Painted windows 
In the blink of an eye... My painted windows
