tip top 
drip drop
bottles  pop, 
lips lock
hips rock
don't stop,
Big Snoop Dogg is back
on the block
P.C. Disney shake that thing
to this beat
taste like brandy
shape like landy
sweet like candy candy candy 
all them other models bottling
like mama's bottle tasty
if you put my bottle
all the models gonna hate me

Chorus:
when my Bottle pop (4x)
shake me
when my Bottle pop (4x)
shake me

  I
every girl dreams of herself in
pearls
wanna be the fast driver of a
shiny car
but the good girls suddenly the
bad girls
just because they wanna be a
superstar
(repeat Chorus)

  II
every girl feels this world be-
longs to her
no matter who make her purr
she's a superstar
now the worry is us
my girl with curves
that'll make you smell the burn
when her bottle pops 
(repeat Chorus)

RAP:
pass the fifth
i pass it back
turn around li'l mama
got ass in the back
see it's a fact a bottle of pop
if you shake it
then drop it like it's hot
time is money
and money is time
and if you with me
aall your money is mine
yup yup
do it deaf
is it true that you get wet 
wet wet ? 
(repeat Chorus) 

bridge:
your turn me on
your shake me up
so don't cha wanna
take me
just because
i'm the chosen one
oh them models gonna hate me
all them models bottling
like mama's bottle tasty
if you put my bottle 
all the models gonna hate me
(repeat Chorus)


when my bottle pop
shake me
