I never needed you to be strong
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
I never needed pain, I never needed strain
My love for you is strong enough you should have known
I never needed you for judgment
I never needed you to question what I spend
I never ask for help
I take care of myself
I dont why you think you got a hold on me

And its a little late for conversations
There isnt anything for you to say
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
So look at me and listen to me because

I dont want to stay another minute
I dont want you to say a single word
Hush hush
Hush hush
There is no other way, I get the final say
Because
I dont want to, do this any longer
I dont want you, theres nothing left to say
Hush hush
Hush hush
Ive already spoken, our love is broken
Baby hush hush

I never needed your corrections
On everything from how I act to what I say
I never needed words I never needed hurts
I never needed you to be there everyday
Im sorry for the way I let go
From everything I wanted when you came along
But I am never beaten, broken not defeated
I know next to you is not where I belong

And its a little late for explanations
There isnt anything that you can do
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver
So you will listen when I say baby

I dont want to stay another minute
I dont want you to say a single word
Hush hush
Hush hush
There is no other way, I get the final say
Because
I dont want to do this any longer
I dont want you theres nothing left to say
Hush hush
Hush hush
Ive already spoken, our love is broken
Baby hush hush

No more words
No more lies
No more crying

No more pain
No more hurt
No more trying

I dont want to stay another minute
I dont want you to say a single word
Hush hush
Hush hush
There is no other way, I get the final say
Because
I dont want to, do this any longer
I dont want you, theres nothing left to say
Hush hush
Hush hush
Ive already spoken, our love is broken---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
