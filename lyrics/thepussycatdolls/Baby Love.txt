You my new school (love) 
You my old school (love) 
And it's so true 
You're the one I'm thinking of 

I remember like it was yesterday 
First kiss and I knew you changed the game 
You have me, exactly, well you want it, 
And I'm on it 

And I ain't ever gonna let you get away 
Holding hands never made me feel this way 
So special, boy it's your, your smile 
We so in love 

La la la la 
Yeah 
We so in love 
La la la la la love
And I just can't get enough 
Of your la la la love 
Yeah we so in love, love 
I want you to know 

You are my baby love, my baby love 
You make the sun come up (Oh boy, oh boy) 
You're my every, everything that I could ever dream of 
You are my baby love, my baby love 
You make the sun come up (Oh boy, oh boy) 
You're my every, every, every, everything 

Been a minute and we still holding it down 
Butterflies every time you come around 
You make me, so crazy 
It's crazy, oh baby 

And I don't ever wanna be with no one else 
You're the only one that ever made me melt 
You're special, boy it's your, your style 
We so in love 

La la la la 
Yeah 
We so in love 
La la la la la love
And I just can't get enough 
Of your la la la love 
Yeah we so in love, love 
I want you to know 

You are my baby love, my baby love 
You make the sun come up (Oh boy, oh boy) 
You're my every, everything that I could ever dream of 
You are my baby love, my baby love 
You make the sun come up (Oh boy, oh boy) 
You're my every, every, every, everything 

Everything, everything, ooo 
Everything, everything, ooo
