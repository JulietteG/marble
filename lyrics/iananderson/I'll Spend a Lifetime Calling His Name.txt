Lyrics and Music Written By Ian Anderson

Im flying high on the wings of an eagle.
I sure am glad to be acquainted and see you here today.
But, were here for more than just a singing.  Yes, Id like to remind you
To lift Jesus, my Savior.  Hes been a friend along the way. 

I cant count the times Ive had to call on His name: 
through the hard times, the good times, and the sorrows.
Since Jesus lifted me up, my life has never been the same.  
Ill spend a lifetime just calling His name.

I dont want to be loved, loved by no other God. 
Ill spend a lifetime just a calling on His name.
I dont want to be loved, loved by no other God.
Ill spend a lifetime just calling His name. 

Im soaring high over painted, desert canyons. 
I see the beauty of His love.  Its more than words can say. 
Although I'll struggle with life tomorrow and trials stand before me; 
I know that nothing in this world can keep Gods love away.

I cant count the times I've had to call on His name. 
I was full of anger, full of hurt, and my foolish pride.
Since Jesus lifted me up, my life has never been the same.  
Ill spend a lifetime just calling his name.

Yes, Ill spend a lifetime calling His name. 
Calling His name.
