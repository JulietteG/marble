Lyrics and Music Written By Ian Anderson

All she wanted was me to get up a little early.
Then, she took the boys and drove to church
But just like always, I had more important things to do, 
Like cut the grass or work on something new.

As time goes by, its things like that I wish that I could change, 
Renew, or redo.
As I relive the past, it hurts to think how I didnt try enough 
To make things last.
We were the Mckannies

They used to hear, Get up, its Monday morning.
Boys, its time to go to school.
Thered be breakfast on the table.  Id drink some coffee, 
Then watch the morning news.
I never really stopped to think what this time should be for.
Id be already gone, before I even hit the door.

Well, time sure has broken this heart of mine.
I keep reliving the promises we made.
Through the laughter, the crying, the hard, but good times,
I cant believe I let my family slip way.

 This weekend, I got my boys.  They helped me move in across town.
I cant believe how much they grown.  They were small just yesterday. 
We were laughing, and just cutting up, in the middle of a baseball game,
When a little boy walked up to my youngest son 
And said, Hey there, whats your name?
My son look down and softly said, 
"We were the Mckannies."

All she wanted me was to get up a little early
