Lyrics Written by Ian Anderson and James Dodd  
Music Written By Ian Anderson

Lord help me to be the servant that You desire.
I know Im a sinner.  Only You can fill my needs.
Id be lost in this world.  Many days and nights Ive wandered. 
I know that You love all Your children, n' yes,
That includes me.

That includes me.  You make rivers out of desert.
That includes me.  Flowing springs from thirsty ground.
And still after two thousand years, 
I can still hear the birds sing, as the moon marks off another day.

And still after two thousand years, 
I can still hear the birds sing as the moon marks off another day.
C 2004, Ian Anderson (BMI)---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
