Lyrics and Music Written By Ian Anderson

Up ahead, I see a road that leads to victory,
But once again I travel with my pride.
I start losing ground; the woods turn empty.

I see a light, and see that I've walked right off the road.
Not knowing where I am or where I'll be,
I pray again, "Jesus help me"

When I come to Jesus, I can't come to show Him me.
His love's much greater than my own understanding.
When I come to Jesus, I've gotta trust Him with my life
And that means, throwing away my pride.

Further down the road, again I walk on my abilities.
I tell myself how strong my legs have become.
I start tumbling down; my life seems empty.

I hear a voice and feel His hand as He's lifting me.
I feel a love and peace I cannot explain.
I get on my knees, say "Jesus, help me."

When I come to Jesus, I can't come to show Him me.
His love's much deeper than my own understanding.
When I come to Jesus, I've gotta trust Him with my life.
And that means throwing away my pride.

Oh, Jesus
If that means throwing away my pride.
