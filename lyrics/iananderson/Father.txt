Lyrics and Music Written By Ian Anderson

I should have known, by the way they left Him lying.
I should have known that the tears from His eyes were of pain, ...
Of pain, of pain.

He walked through the streets with the cross on His shoulders.
His people laughed and ridiculed the name He claimed to be.
They could not see.  They would not see

Many years have come and gone between us, 
Though His words are still written on the walls of my life,
Of my life,of my life. 

Father, I know You guide me.  And lead me by the hand. 
Father,  I know You show me just who I really am   

Who I really am. 
C 2004, Ian Anderson (BMI)---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
