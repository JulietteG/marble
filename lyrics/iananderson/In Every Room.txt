Lyrics and Music Written By Ian Anderson

Katie opens the door and finds herself alone again.
Then, she sits down to read through the mail 
She got from the day before.
She kneels down to pray, with always something to say, 
Ending with, Thank you, Lord. 
Takes off her shoes, pulls back the sheets, and turns out the light. 

In every room are pictures of the life they shared.
Although hes not there to hold her, Katie feels him there.
In every room are memories of water-colored years
With the hope of tomorrow, she still fights back the tears.
In every room

Katie pulls back the blinds and lets the light shine through.
Then she walks out to greet her grandchildren, as they fly through the door. 
They sit down to eat.  
Every Tuesday they meet.
The children always make her smile.
They walk to the door.  Kiss her goodnight.  Katie waves goodbye.

And In every room are echoes from a love shes known.
Although hes not there to hold her, Katie presses on.  
In every room are memories of answered prayers.
With the hope of tomorrow, she knows hes waiting there.
In every room

Katie opens the door to find herself alone again.
She kneels down to pray, with always something to say, 
Ending with, Thank you, Lord.
