When I was surrounded by the world
You were the only one who came
And you were the only one astounded
Which kept me grounded
As the other girls trashed my very name

Then I looked over
Just in time to see her smiling back at me
And saying everything's OK
As long as you're inside my blue veins
Your blue veins

Yeah, and the feeling that you gave me
No matter what I do or where I go it always will remain
And those who would enslave me
To get to me must get past you and will have no luck
'Cause you'll protect me from all pain

(That's true, you know why) You're the most beautiful
Yeah, the most beautiful thing
'Cause anything else can't compare
Must be the blood that's running through your blue veins
Your blue veins

(weird part in reverse)

Your blue veins

And I know you won't deceive me like the rest
And there's nothing you need to explain
You always were the first one to believe me
When I said to you girl I think it's gonna rain
But I could be wrong

Yeah, but all of these things, all these things
They're all truly nice but ain't nothing
Ain't nothing compared to the love
That's running through your little blue veins
Your blue veins---Lyrics submitted by Lisa.
