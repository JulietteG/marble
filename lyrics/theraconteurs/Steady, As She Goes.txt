Find yourself a girl, and settle down.
Live a simple life, in a quiet town.

Steady as she goes (steady as she goes).
Steady as she goes (steady as she goes).
So, steady as she goes.

Your friends have shown a kink in the single life,
You've had too much to think, now you need a wife.

Steady as she goes (steady as she goes).
So, steady as she goes.

Well, here we go again
When you found yourself a friend that knows you well.
But no matter what you do, you always feel that you tripped and fell...

So, steady as she goes.

When you completed what you thought you had to do,
Your blood's depleted to the point of stable glue, 

Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along

Steady as she goes (steady as she goes).
So, steady as she goes (steady as she goes)
Well, here we go again
When you found yourself a friend that knows you well.
But no matter what you do, you always feel that you tripped and fell...
So, steady as she goes.
Steady as she goes.

Settle for a girl and buckle down,
Send it to the crowd that's gathered round,

Settle for a girl and buckle down,
Send it to the crowd that's gathered round,
Settle for a girl and buckle down,
Send it to the crowd that's gathered round-

So, steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So, steady as she goes (Steady as she goes).

Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?
Steady as she goes
Are you steady now?

Steady as she goes.---Lyrics submitted by J..
