Well I'm rollin' down that Texas line to see that bar room gill
If I'm to get fired up and mean and drinkin' time my friends
I know that someone's going down, that's the rumor  I hear on streets
I take that jack and put it on my ass 'cause I'm a redneck fuck from Tennessee

Well I don't give a fuck no more 'cause pa's on trucker speed
I've done me twenty years of ridin' these lines and I definitly got forty in me
I never give in to what I fear, cause I'm dealin' with the devil you see
I'm ridin' this hate train every fuckin mile and I'm never gonna run outta steam

Well damn right you better watch your ass when you're dealing with a rebel like me.
That's right I'm a son of a son of a bitch and that makes me Hank 3
When I'm going down I don't need no one to be there next to me
I'm doing' time on this ol' hate line and I'm never gonna run outta steam

Well I'm rollin' down that Texas line to see that bar room gill
If I'm to get fired up and mean and drinkin' time my friends
Yeah I know  someone's going down, that's the rumor that I hear on streets
I take my jack and put it on my ass 'cause I'm a wild buck from Tennessee
And I take that jack and put it on my ass 'cause I'm a rebel fuck from Tennessee---Lyrics submitted by Darrell.
