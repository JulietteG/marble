We're gonna
We're gonna make this a night
Listen

When you love someone that's matchful not demanding
That's one thing I'm proud to say I found in you
I'm so glad we reached that understanding
Now I know my heart is safe with you
So now my love to you baby I surrender

Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Celebration to my heart, could stay united
And there is nothing in this world to come between me and you
We're together and it keeps me so excited
To think of what the power of our love can do
Oh, and I'm filled with a love that's so, so tender

Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

We're gonna make this a night
We're gonna make this a night
You won't forget, I won't forget

Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Let's make a toast to those who help make this occasion
They turn they backs on God
But that's what drove you straight to me
Now with you I'll make a lasting dedication
I'll show you all the love that life can be
Oh, and these days that I will never deliver

Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

We're gonna make this a night
We're gonna make this a night
We gotta make this a night
We gotta make this a night---
