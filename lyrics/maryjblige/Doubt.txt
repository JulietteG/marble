You said I'd never be a leader
You said I'd never wear a crown
If I wanted to be someone
I should learn to settle down

(You should know better)
I tell myself
(You'll never go further)
I warn myself
(You'll never be better)
Don't know me that well

I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I'd do it all again
'Cause I made it to the top
But I can't keep doubting myself anymore

No!
I can't keep doubting myself

Now you're looking at a leader
Now you're staring at a queen
You said I'll never be someone
But now I'm pulling all the strings

(You should know better)
Won't let me back down
(You'll never go further)
Can't turn me around
(You'll never be better)
So no-one's stopping me now

I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I'd do it all again
'Cause I made it to the top
I can't keep doubting myself anymore

No!
I can't keep doubting myself

You think you know
But you don't know the half
You think you beat me down
But I'll have the last laugh
I'll keep getting up
'Cause that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna be the best me
Sorry if it kills you

I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I'd do it all again
'Cause I made it to the top
But I can't keep doubting myself anymore
No! No!
I can't keep doubting myself anymore---
