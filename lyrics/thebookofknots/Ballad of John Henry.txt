your head will have the little wife
the dress she worn was red
the last thing before he dies, he said
"they truth me wheh I'm dead"
they truth me when I'm dead
ohhh they truth me when I'm dead

your head's wife is asking
"hey just ask for 50 cents?"
he said "I'd have to die"
but he said "but if you wanna feel the rhymes before the sun goes down,
I'll borrow it from the man in the mine"
borrow it from the man in the mine

your head is starting all right thought 
and the steam drop 's gonna limp 
it's it before I let that steam drop beat me down?
I'll hammer my fool self to dead

your head is starting at the same time 
your head is starting the past ate
and the steam drop's any bottom to now
the steam drop is any bottom to now

your head is said to his captain 
"a man he eat, but a man,
before I'll get that steam drop
beat me down, 
oh right down,
with the hammer 
in my hand"
with the hammer in my hand

your head is said to his shaker
"shaker, why don't you sing just like a fool around us,
and before the setting sun goes down
you're gonna hear me hammer,
hammer my sound"
your'e gonna her me hammer my sound

your really head on a mountain
your head will to have past pink
he said "is this speed is a bad tunnel on the slithering road, 
it's gonna be the death mean"
Ohhh, it's gonna be the death mean

your really head, a litlle baby's born
"you couldn't hold him with the palm in your hand,
but that's what would have been before he died, son"
it must be a steam drop band
"son, it must be a steam drop band"---Lyrics submitted by Bookofknots.
