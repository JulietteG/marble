I worked at the mill
the same as my father and my brothers too
my mother had worked there
she'd hidden there, isn't it she left school?
but today they look all like they'd to go
look's like i've to keep this job

but tonight 
I looked up, the stars're burning bright
and under house, 
a lot locked awes
of nevermore
with all that gilrls, with nothing left to show
what once slept hard,
will come down 
at midnight

people above's don't come up this ruin no more
this town is like a stone
we others take the sun for days
and I'm here worjking on my own
and I wish I could leave

but tonight
under the stars, we built, it's  burning bright
a heavy hope, 
that once was ours,
but nevermore
with all that girls, with nothing left to show
what once slept hard, 
will come down
at midnight

but tonight 
we'll pull it away
the stars'll be burning bright
nothing more, but what's under this house 
will tell the story
with all the girls, with nothing left to show
what once slept hard,
will come down
tonight

ohhhhhhhhhh---Lyrics submitted by Bookofknots.
