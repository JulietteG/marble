(Chorus)
It was a boomtown that was breaking my heart.
This little boomtown has taken its part.
I had a stake in this and I took it hard.
It was a boomtown, boomtown...

How hot do you want it? Make it hot as you've got.
Reggae blues, backstreet backbeat and the Irish social club slots.
Italian chip-shop heiress meets the Soviet crew.
Hard girls with handle glasses and pretty prostitutes playing pool.

(Chorus)

All the dockers and the rockers, navy grog, baggies of weed.
Never saw a dog that couldn't be beat.
You ever get the feeling that you can't compete?
She fucking left him and then he lost the pub.
It's been boarded up for fifteen months or more now.
She lost the country so she torched the town,
and built an on-site dole office to deal with the crowd
while the furnaces were still cooling down.
Municipal golf course, round after round,
dew on the grass, piss on the ground.

(Chorus)

We saw genuine blugrass band playing in the park,
we drank cider in the dark,
as the rain rolled in off the sea,
we went back to your house, soaked to the skin,
your dad came in,
and he pretended not to see.

Alright, the dock gates been locked now,
you need a pass to get in and look around,
big container ships with shit from the stores outside town,
it's all quiet, it's scary, think they'll have a night in,
or fill up the streets with drinking and fighting?---Lyrics submitted by mjohnson.
