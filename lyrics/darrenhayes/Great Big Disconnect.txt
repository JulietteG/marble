You got God if you pay for it.
You got sex if you pray for it
And those ever-elusive weapons of mass destruction.

You got Jesus with the palest skin.
You had Lennon but you wasted him.
I got sleeping pills that will make you wanna to call your mamma.

Because everyones keeping their love far away.
Everyones keeping their love far away.

You got phones with 3D eyes.
And youre lonely but you dont know why.
Somebody just killed a man and I forgot to moisturise.

You got Aids in Africa.
You got Paris in a new sports bra.
You got therapists to justify your behaviour.

And everyones keeping their love far away.
Everyones keeping their love far away

And I love drug companies,
So full of generosity.
Had something else to say but it must have slipped my mind.
It must have slipped my mind.

So write another love song and pretend that nothings wrong.
And if a feeling comes just call me in the morning.

And everyones keeping their love far away.
Everyones keeping their love far away.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
