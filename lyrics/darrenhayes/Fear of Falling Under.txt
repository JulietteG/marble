Deep into the water 

Deep into the dark

Deep into the places

Stories have to start

Peel open the layers

Go in for the kill

Bite into the onion

Taste it for the thrill



[Chorus]:

Got a fear of falling under
Underneath the dream
Fears got too deep
Deep beneath the seams

Fear of falling under
Underneath the spell
A Fear of what the truth sees
Secrets I will tell

Reach into a top hat
Reach in all alone
Reach in for a rabbit
Come up with a stone
Searching for pieces
pieces left behind
Discarded moments 
In the junkyard of my mind

[Chorus]

What came first
Love, Hurt
Love, Hurt
(x4)---Lyrics submitted by Jesus.
