Nobody told you that a heart is like a deep, deep freeze.
So many lies, so much of it broken.
Nobody told you deep within a well so cavernous,
That maybe I could shed some light on.
Who would have thought it could be amazing?
Who would have thought the tiny courageous?
Who would have thought that love so belated could save me?
And bring me back to you?

Nobody told you thered be days of silence that no one heard.
A river swells and overwhelms you.
Nobody told you deep within a heart so ravenous,
That maybe I could spare a beat for.
Who would have thought it could be amazing?
Who would have thought the tiny courageous?
Who would have thought that love so belated could save me?
And bring me back to you?

I had to find you had to let you know that you werent alone, that we didnt make the rules.
I had to find you had to get right back to you.
I had to find you had to let you know that you werent alone, that we didnt make the rules.
I had to find you had to get right back to you.
Its always been you.

Now tell me.
Who would have thought it could be this amazing?
Who would have thought the tiny courageous?
Who would have thought that love so belated could save me?
And bring me back to you?---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
