You step behind a curtain in a moment you were gone.
No nothings ever certain and its hard to carry on.
This is not what we planned and I know its hard to understand but,
If this is what you want then.
If this is what you need pry my fingers from your hand.

Maybe its just meant to be.
Maybe youll find a way to haunt me, come back and sing a melody to me.
Maybe were just lost at sea.
Maybe Im holding on to driftwood and Ill be alright if you could
Sing to me.
Sing to me.

You step beneath a landslide.
Nothing feels right when youre wrong.
And try to find an upside, try to sing without a song.
This is not what we planned and I know its hard to understand but,
If this is what you want then.

Maybe its just meant to be.
Maybe youll find a way to haunt me, come back and sing a melody to me.
Maybe Im just lost at sea.
Maybe Im holding on to driftwood and Ill be alright if you could
Sing to me.
Sing to me.

I keep seeing flashes of your hands when I close my eyes and I dont know why.
And I dont know why.
Help me make sense of what I dont understand because Ive got to know why.
Ive got to know why.
Tell me why do you sing to me?

Maybe its just meant to be,
That you would sing to me.
Maybe Im just lost at sea.
Could you come sing to me?
Maybe its just meant to be.
Maybe were just lost at sea.
Would you come sing for me?
Sing for me.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
