This time Ill try to love again.
Ill never lose you my friend.
Ill be there until the end forever.
This time Ill take the happy pill.
Ill chew off more than I can spill.
And play until you stay forever.

But nobody said it would be easy now.
We live in a lucky town.
But the foundations are shaking the bridges are breaking in two.
Nobody said it would be easy now.
I dont want to let you down.
But my heart is alight its alright cause its burning for you
And it burns right through.

This time Ill try to make believe.
Ill wear my heart upon my sleeve.
Just take it when you leave its better.
This time Ill be the better man.
I know the world will understand.
Greatness is overrated youll see.

But nobody said it would be easy now.
We live in a lucky town.
But the foundations are shaking the bridges are breaking in two.
Nobody said it would be easy now.
I dont want to let you down.
But my heart is alight its alright cause its burning for you
And it burns right through.

This time Ill try to love again.
This time Ill never lose you my friend.
Ill stay until the end
Forever and ever and ever.

But nobody said it would be easy now.
We live in a lucky town.
But the foundations are shaking the bridges are breaking in two.
Nobody said it would be easy now.
I dont want to let you down.
But my heart is alight its alright cause its burning for you.

Nobody said it would be easy now.
We live in a lucky town.
But my heart is on fire and the bridges are burning for you.
Nobody said it would be easy now.
But my heart is on fire and you know its alright cause its burning for you.
Nobody said it would be easy now.
We live in a lucky town.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
