Leave me alone.
Come over here.
I know it sounds funny but I just cant stand another day on my own.
Another bug in my ear sounds like noise to me.
Living alone.
A chill in the air.
I dont hear from my brother he is living in another continent far away.
And it was his birthday today
But I think I missed it.

Setting sun.
I think Im heading for a setting sun.
I really need to find a way back home.
Oh its so urgent.
Theres an urgency.

Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
Still chasing my daddy singing songs about my mammy.
Got to let it go
Before I go down with the ship.
Theres my heartache sinking.
Leave it alone.
Put it to bed.
Everybody changing memory set in the pages of an email or two.
Yeah I read all 32.
It was love prized out of you.

Setting sun.
I think Im heading for a setting sun.
I really need to find a way back home.
Oh its so urgent.
Theres an urgency behind the setting sun.
I think Im heading for a setting sun.
I really need to find a way back home.
Oh its so urgent.
Theres an urgency.

Do I make you hot?
Do I make you uncomfortable?
A stirring down in your soul for something more.
Does it happen a lot?
Does the drudgery bring you down?
Is anyone still around?
Im coming down.

Oh
Do I make you hot?
Do I make you uncomfortable?
A stirring down in your soul for something more.
Does it happen a lot?
Does the drudgery bring you down?
Is anyone still around?
Oh setting sun.
I think Im heading for a setting sun.
I really need to find a way back home.
Its so urgent.
Theres an urgency.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
