It was a coal town.
He spent his whole life in a hole in the ground
Smashing pieces of earth.
He never really saw the sky.
It was a hard life.
But little black rocks make televisions work
And put food on the table.
Until the unions cast him aside.
Now theres a hundred challenging things a boy can do.
And youve waved goodbye and held more tears in than anyone ever should.
And all my sorrows pale to insignificance.
Thats why I love you.

She was in a strange land.
She taught herself to read from doing crosswords and hiding her accent.
She cast her dreams aside.
She had a spark in her eye.
She never saw her son on his wedding day or our cherry blossoms falling down
From the sky.
Now theres a hundred challenging things a boy can do.
And youve waved goodbye and held more tears in than anyone ever should.
And all my sorrow pales to insignificance.
Thats why I love you.

No coal mines.
No not a trace.
Now shopping malls take their place.
No picket lines.

The sacrifice.
Dreams overrun.
Hopes for a future for her son in Ollerton.
And theres a hundred challenging things a boy can do.
And youve waved goodbye and held more tears in than anyone ever should.
All my sorrows pale in to insignificance.
Thats why she loves you.

A hundred challenging things a boy can do.
Wave goodbye.
Wave goodbye.
A hundred challenging.
Say goodbye to you.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
