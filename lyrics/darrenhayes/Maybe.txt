Maybe you're gone.
You had to get out of here.
It's easy to get lost in fear.
But maybe now the weight has lifted you're sailing through the air.

Making your way.
A travelling acrobat.
Youre putting on your bowler hat.
Speeding through the atmosphere
Past planes and meteorites.

Maybe you're gone maybe you're lost somewhere.
Floating in outer space.
A radio wave tuning into some secret place I've never been.
Leaving your heart beating in fragile hands.
And nobody understands.
Maybe youre gone.
Maybe you are finally coming home.

Maybe the end is the beginning.
The game is no fun when you're winning.
The pool is empty unless youre swimming and trying to keep afloat.

Maybe you stayed just a little while.
The party was over but you realised that memory makes you immortalised.
You end when you're beginning.

Maybe you're gone maybe you're lost somewhere.
Floating in outer space.
A radio wave tuning into some secret place I've never been.
Leaving your heart beating in fragile hands.
And nobody understands.
Maybe youre gone.
Maybe you are finally coming home.

All the lights shine above you they become a part of you.
All the earth seems so tiny in your hands.
All the stars move inside you.
All the pain, well thats behind you.
All secrets will blind you.
Understand?

Maybe you had to get out of here.
Maybe you lost your way down here.
Maybe you've found a shinier star.
A shinier star.
Leaving your heart beating in fragile hands.
And nobody understands.
Maybe youre gone.
Maybe you are finally coming home.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
