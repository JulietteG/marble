Driving in your car with the windows down and a beat up stereo.
Struggle with this town because you love to hate it but hate to let it go.
And were all alone and so tired of being underrated.
So dont take me home because I feel alive when you come and save me.
A yellow car speeding down the south side freeway
Well rewrite this movie, make it end like we want it to.

And Casey when you go.
Can you come and find me? Want to be beside you when you leave this town.
Ill be waving goodbye pretending not to cry. I want to be someone.
If you take me away all the pain will change into a memory of when we were amazing.

1989
Summer had hit but it was not moving.
What is it with this town?
Every time we win it just feels like losing.
And we were never going to fit in.
I was a mixed up kid and you were my sanity in a yellow car.
We dont even have to go far.
Because that song youre playing sounds like peace on the radio.

And Casey when you go.
Can you come and find me? Want to be beside you when you leave this town.
Ill be waving goodbye pretending not to cry. I want to be someone.
If you take me away all the pain will change into a memory of when we were amazing.
I know things will change but Casey stay the same.
Take me away.
We dont have to go far.

Casey when you go.
Can you come and find me? Want to be beside you when you leave this town.
Ill be waving goodbye pretending not to cry. I want to be someone.
If you take me away all the pain will change into a memory of when we were,
Of when we were.
Casey when you go.
Can you come and find me? Want to be beside you when you leave this town.
Ill be waving goodbye pretending not to cry. I want to be someone.
If you take me away all the pain will change into a memory of when we were amazing.

Driving in your car with the windows down and a beat up stereo.
I wanna, Im gonna, I want to be someone.
I wanna, Im gonna, I want to be someone.
I will run to you.
I will come to you.
I will run to you.
I will come to you.
Shes coming to get me.
Shes coming to rescue me.
Coming through the sky like a satellite, like a radio wave, a meteorite.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
