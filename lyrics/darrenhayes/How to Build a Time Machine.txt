If I have understood correctly velocity equals the distance travelled divided by time.
I've read every word ever printed on quantum physics and now it is time to try.
I read your book, I found your notes, I dusted this thing off and turned on the key.
The rumbling motors, the buzzing incredible gadgets, the hissing electricity.
And now, the moment has come.
Im travelling back in time.
They're running down the hall.
I've started the countdown.
They want me to stop.
But I don't think so.
I'm ready to go.
Let's get the job done!

Beyond the paradoxical all the lights are dazzling.
Past the planes and trains and satellite navigation.
Past the time I spent today through the nearest wormhole.
In a stunning ball of white the light explodes and lands on you.
And you're five.
Always running away when I was dying to kiss you and I,
I don't want to cry, I don't want to see where the moving van takes you
so I travel on.
Beyond the stars.
At one hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second I can fly.
Forward a few years, to nineteen hundred and seventy nine I caught a glimpse of the sky.

Theyre coming down the road.
They're coming to get me.
I never should have come.
I hide the time machine.
I'm running down the hall.
I think I'm at my old house.
Past the place where I grew up.
Number 9 Lake Road.
Past the swimming pool and Mabel Park and past Troy Clifford's house.
To the Argonaut.
To the fish and chip shop.
Out the back and down the road and to the place I got beat up.

Hey! Put that rock down!
Can't you see he's half your size?
Hey! He looks familiar.
Oh my God it's me aged nine!

Put your shoes on and run away from here.
I can't get involved this is all so weird.
I'm meeting myself this is all so clear.

All the things I lost. All the people I hurt.
All the times I lied. All the moments wasted.
All I never did. All the dreams I had.
All the things I would change. I can change them.
All the things I lost. All the people I hurt.
All the times I lied. All the moments wasted.

I'm gonna make right what I made wrong and change how the future has gone.
Through appliance of science I'll take hold of my enemies.
Take their obscenities.
Kiss them and leave them like lovers who've gone.
I'll call my dad, I'll tell him I miss him and tell my reflection it's not your fault.
And now the moment has come.
Im travelling back in time.

They're running down the hall.
I've started the countdown.
They want me to stop.
But I don't think so.
I'm ready to go.
Let's get the job done!

Put your shoes on and run away from here.
I can't get involved this is all so weird.

Oh my God it's me aged 9!
Let's get the job done!

All the things I lost. All the people I hurt.
All the times I lied. All the moments wasted.
All I never did. All the dreams I had.
All the things I would change. I can change them.

Beyond the paradoxical all the lights are dazzling.
Past the planes and trains and satellite navigation.
Past the time I spent today through the nearest wormhole.
In a stunning ball of white the light explodes into another moment.---Lyrics submitted by Ajay.
