I don't want love and I don't want anybody else, 
anybody else to either.
I don't want faith and I don't want to start another war,
 a kingdom for my crowd of believers.
Did I lose my calling? Did I lose you? Don't lovers always get what they want?

I made a stupid mistake and my world crashed down all around me, Oh oh oh.
I made a stupid mistake and I threw it all away, 
I threw it all away.
I got lazy, on the wrong side of love. 
Now I'm searching, every face in the crowd for you.. 
for you... for you... for you.

I don't want a stain and I don't want your love upon my hands, 
But I don't understand what I'm leaving.
I don't want to pray but I don't want forgiveness from above,
 When none of this was of my believing.
Did I chose to fall down? Did I lose you? Don't lovers always get what they want?

I made a stupid mistake and my world crashed down all around me, Oh oh oh.
I made a stupid mistake and I threw it all away, 
I threw it all away.
I got lazy, on the wrong side of love. 
Now I'm searching, every face in the crowd for you.. 
for you... for you... for you.

I've been walking around with my head in the dirt.
I've been stripped of everything that ever made me come first.
I've been lonely.
I've been searching the crowds for you... for you.
I got lazy, on the wrong side of love. 
I was stupid. Sold my kingdom for a war with you... Oh.
With you... Oh.
Oh oh oh oh (times 2)

I made a stupid mistake and my world crashed down all around me, Oh oh oh.
I made a stupid mistake and I threw it all away, 
I threw it all away.
I got lazy, on the wrong side of love. 
Now I'm searching, every face in the crowd for you.. 
for you... for you... for you. Oooo.

You don't want love and you don't want anybody else to either.---Lyrics submitted by Tabitha Sizemor.
