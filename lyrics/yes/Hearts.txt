Hearing - Talking - Yes I - Love you

Set your heart sail on the river
Look around you as you drift downstream
Pouring souls into the ocean
Take account of all you've seen

Hearing
Talking
Love you

One people - Together
Freedom for today
So easy the future
So see the children's way

Love me
Teach me
Know me

One people - Together
Freedom for today
Tomorrow forever
So see the people's way

Many moons cascade one river
They light from side to side
As we cross in close proximity
Like rivers our hearts entwine
How we talk - How we teach our children
How we move - We direct our eyes
All the senses tuned discovery
As and as and when our hearts decide
Be ready now - Be ye circle
Be the central force ye life
As the game extends the cycle
Be ready to move

One heart's for love
One's for giving
Two hearts are better
Than one
I hearing it
I living it
I believe in it
Two hearts are better
Than one
Hearts
Sailing down the river
Hearts
Throwing out a line
Hearts

Sharing out your fortunes
Hearts
In and out of time

Hearing - Talking - Yes I - Love

One heart's for love
One's for giving
Two hearts are better

Who would believe you - Wise men do
Days that we knew it clear with you
You sing the answers question time
Now it you need me let our hearts entwine
Let our hearts entwine

Hearts - Sailing down the river
Hearts - Throwing out a line
I hearing it - I living it - I believe in it - I loving it

Hearts
Two hearts will always be
In and out of time

As we flow down life's rivers
I see the stars glow - One by one
All angels of the magic constellation
Be singing us now---
