You'll be at my side
Through it all
Through hardships unseen
We still survive, fortified

Please don't pass me by
Can you hear me calling out your name
Forgive the things I do
Don't turn your back when I need you
The war rages on

When darkness comes
You're like a burning light
Through it all
When storm knocks me down
Call for me from the depths
Time after time

Please don't pass me by
Can't you hear me calling out your name
Please forgive the things I do
Don't turn your back when I need you

War rages on I'm still here by your side
Blood of the dawn ends the darkest of nights
War Rages On I'm still here by your side
Blood of the dawn ends the darkest of nights

Please don't pass me by
Can't you hear me calling out your name
Please forgive the things I do
Don't turn your back when I need you
The war rages on
The war rages on---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
