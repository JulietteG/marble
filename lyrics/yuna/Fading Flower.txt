You got that walk walk walk
Got that talk talk talk
Got that swagger-er-er
Such a glamor-or-or
You're like a real life doll
With your hand that falls
Like niagara-a-a
But that don't matter-er-er
Cause that don't change the fact
That your heart is black
You can't tear me down
Beat me to the ground
Try to block my sunshine
My blue skies with your clouds
And who do you think you are
Yet that won't get you far
You may think you're pretty
But you'll see that beauty
is a Fading Flower
Fading Floa-a-a-wer
Fading Floa-a-a-wer
You only wil play, play, play
If you get your way
Always in the cent-er-er
Of attention-on-on
All the lying and cheating
The mistreatment how you even sleep at
night-ight-ight, blows my mind-ind-ind
I wonder where you'll see
That you don't bother me

(chorus)

I spent all my youth, trying to be you,
thought that you were special, thought that you were beautiful,
But the more of you I see
the more Im glad I'm me

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by bellatrixavior.
