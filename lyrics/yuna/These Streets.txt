I patiently waited for something to replace my dark
I got out of my bed cos I couldnt sleep I took my car
Its beautiful moonlit road tonight
Ive got no one here by my side
I used to walk under these lights with you

Chorus
And even if you left a long time ago
I miss you so
And even if you left a long time ago
I miss you so

And its hard to tell
If you ever come again
And its hard to tell
If you felt this for someone else
And its hard to tell
If you want to remember this
Its hard to tell

Ive always known
I was never your muse
Never looked at me the way I look at you
And you always that you love me more
But you never show it to me before
Ill always know I was never your muse

Ulang Chorus

And its hard to tell
If you ever come again
And its hard to tell
If you felt this for someone else
And its hard to tell
If you want to remember this
And its hard to tell
And its hard to tell
And its hard to tell

Its hard cos you dont come around anymore
I hope you find whatever is
Youre looking for
I hope you miss the streets like I do
Cos this is what love of me and you---Lyrics submitted by nasha.
