Youre more than what you make yourself to be
Youre holding back a side we've yet to see
Youre buried six feet deep and no one cares
I'll show you how to sweep them off their feet
Forget their ways, they choose to be
Everything thats fake and insincere

As wind sets, we'll forget
We'll move ahead, we'll find our way
As wind sets, we'll forget
Its not too late

Caught up with the way life seems to make you
Feel as if you say I wont make it through
Youre hanging by a thread when no one seems to care
But you'll find it in your heart I will be there

Stop buying all the things seen on TV
You falling into what they make you think
You've lost the only thing that makes you feel
I'll prove it to the world for all to see
Beneath their smiles, they fear for the
Chance they might have missed a life thats real

As wind sets, we'll forget
We'll move ahead, we'll find our way
As wind sets, we'll forget
Its not too late

Caught up with the way life seems to make you
Feel as if you say I wont make it through
Youre hanging by a thread when no one seems to care
But you'll find it in your heart I will be there

Caught up with the way life seems to make you
Feel as if you say I wont make it through
Youre hanging by a thread when no one seems to care
But you'll find that in your heart I will be there

As wind sets, we'll forget
We'll move ahead, we'll find our way
As wind sets, we'll forget
Its not too late

Caught up with the way life seems to make you
Feel as if you say I wont make it through
The moments in our lives when all things come to
See the other side stay strong, stay true
Youre hanging by a thread when no one seems to care
But you'll find that in your heart I will be there---Lyrics submitted by mark.
