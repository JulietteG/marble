From your words, I can tell youve lost a reason,
The will to carry on
No chance that we will make it,
Youve faked it for so long
But Im standing here before for you,
As your barely holding on
And Im writing just to show you
There's strength in who you are

We live and we fall
But I'll try to move on
Its so hard to be the one left on my own
We live and we fall
But Ill keep moving on
Its so hard to be the one left on my own

From the night, I can faintly here you breathing,
I know that youre around
I can feel your arms around me,
I'll take the water down
But Im standing here before you,
As your deep within this ground
And Im trying just to show you
That in me you can be found

We live and we fall
But I'll try to move on
Its so hard to be the one left on my own
We live and we fall
But Ill keep moving on
Its so hard to be the one left on my own

You mean more to me now its gone forever
I wont forget, Ill make things better
With you I'm more then I will ever be
You were there when I looked for you to guide me
Through all the times that I spent feeling
Sure of a sense that you were there for me

We live and we fall
But I'll try to move on
Its so hard to be the one left on my own
We live and we fall
But Ill keep moving on
Its so hard to be the one left on my own

We live and we fall
But I'll try to move on
Its so hard to be the one left on my own
We live and we fall
But Ill keep moving on
Its so hard to be the one left on my own

On my own...---Lyrics submitted by jomar cursame.
