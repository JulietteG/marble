Can we make this last forever
With every word we're growing distant
And I feel as though I have to let you know

It's growing old to see us torn by every choice that I have made
In every instant you were right to write me off and move ahead
And I think I let you down, I throw it all away
I never meant to break it up or make you feel this way

It's getting colder through these walls that seem to thin to break us now
A perfect ending still in line though it seems our time is running out
And just a call from you would make this go away
I never felt this day would come, I'll never be the same

Can we make this last forever
With every word you're growing distant
And I feel as though I have to let you go (let you go...)
Can we make this time together
Seem as though we never started
And it's hard to be the only one to know (to know...)

Through open eyes I sense a feeling painted black that lines your heart
It's bleeding through just like the colors that I've seen right from the start
And if I had the choice to do this all again
Would you be inclined to notice it or would you just pretend...

Can we make this last forever
With every word you're growing distant
And I feel as though I have to let you go (let you go...)
Can we make this time together
Seem as though we never started
And it hurts to be the only one to know (to know...)

Remember how we used to be...
(How we used to be...)
Remember how we used to be...
(How we used to be...)

Can we make this last forever
With every word you're growing distant
And I feel as though I have to let you go...
Can we make this time together
Seem as though we never started
And it's hard to be the only one to know...

Can we make this last forever
With every word you're growing distant
And I feel as though I have to let you go (let you go...)
Can we make this time together
Seem as though we never started
And it's hard to be the only one to know (to know...)---Lyrics submitted by jo.
