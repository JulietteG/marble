=FALL BACK INTO MY LIFE BY AMBER PACIFIC= 

I know it's not enough to say I'm wrong 
You know that I will miss you now you're gone 
I know it's not your life to see this through 
Just know that in my heart, it beats for you 
So leave a little note for me behind 
I swear I have to know the reasons why 
This won't survive 

But if you fall back into my life 
I'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear inside 
Telling me to be your only one 

But if you fall back into my life 
I promise you I would never let another day just pass us by 
I could never leave this world undone 
I want to be your only one 

And now it's not the same with you away 
Just holding onto hope to save my days 
I won't survive 
So just stay with me tonight, and try 

But if you fall back into my life 
I'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear inside 
Lyrics 
Telling me to be your only one 

But if you fall back into my life 
I promise you I would never let another day just pass us by 
I could never leave this war unsung 
I want to be your only one 

But if you fall back into my life 
I'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear inside 
Telling me to be your only one 

But if you fall back into my life 
I promise you I would never let another day just pass us by 
I could never leave this world undone 
I could never leave this war unsung 
I want to be your only one---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
