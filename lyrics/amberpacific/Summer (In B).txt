it's time to fake what you say
as you're turning away
though it's hard to be fake
facing you every day

with regret, with remorse
for the things that were said
but you know how alone
we'll end up in the end

cause i don't want to see our lives
destroyed by dismay
in these times of try
we live or die again

[Chorus]
you're my summer that fades
to these cold autumn days
you're my keepsake, my friend
and my fears
you're the strength that's inside
and i swear on my life
i will always be there by your side

it's hard to live without love
with the chance that you may
find the whole world is waiting
to hear what you say

from the heart through your veins
to the answers that came
here to save me, to guide me
to show me the way

so i don't want to see our lives
destroyed by dismay
in these times of try
we live or die again

[Chorus]
you're my summer that fades
to these cold autumn days
you're my keepsake, my friend
and my fears
you're the strength that's inside
and i swear on my life
i will always be there by your side

so take this time to see that i
cant leave this all to chance
so take this time to see that i
have hope that lies will end

[Chorus x2]
you're my summer that fades
to these cold autumn days
you're my keepsake, my friend
and my fears
you're the strength that's inside
and i swear on my life
i will always be there by your side

i will always be there by your side
i will always be there by your side---Lyrics submitted by megan.
