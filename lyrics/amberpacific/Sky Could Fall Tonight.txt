Sky Could Fall Tonight
Amber Pacific

You don't care about impossible 
Something I wish I could learn from you 
Write me down is the best idea you had 
Watch the fire fly 'cause I struck the match tonight 

When you held me tight through this moment in time 
Pull these words off from my lips 
Keep them safe, just remember that we wrote... 

There's a hope 
There's a light 
And I see it in your eyes 
And I hope you can see it in mine 
(There's a secret held inside) 
There's a chance 
And a time 
That the sky could fall tonight 
And I will be here at your side 

Watch as the ground turns as dark as the 
Shadows cast on them and I disappear... 
How are you perfect when I'm just wasting time 
Just to coast inside and I'm waiting for the fall... 

When you held me tight with a sense in your eyes 
When I'm with you things are right 
I'll keep you safe, just remember that we wrote... 

There's a hope 
There's a light 
And I see it in your eyes 
And I hope you can see it in mine 
(And everything could fall tonight) 
There's a chance 
And a time 
That the sky could fall tonight 
And I will be here at your side 

Stars are never out of reach for you (just dream, just dream...) 
Hold out your hand and touch the sky 
Just dream (Just dream...) 
Just dream 
Tonight 

There's a hope 
There's a light 
And I see it in your eyes 
And I hope you can see it in mine 
(And everything could fall tonight) 
There's a chance 
And a time 
That the sky could fall tonight 
And I will be here at your side 
If the sky should fall tonight 
I will be here at your side 
If you fall tonight I'm here...---Lyrics submitted by mitChaeLbOo.
