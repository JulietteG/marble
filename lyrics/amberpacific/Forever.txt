In my heart is where you are
It's where you'll always be
Staring out across the stars
A perfect memory
It brings me back to your arms,
I feel the warm embrace
Of everything that you were,
You're everything to me

And if I leave you here forever
Forever I would stay
Cause I've been feeling so much better
With every single day
And if I could control the weather,
The clouds and the rain
I know you're part of something deeper,
You're better off this way

You can predict you can't become
Lost in your ways
I miss you most now you're gone
I'll never be the same
I can't hold back when it shows
I'm breaking down to say
I won't forget who you were,
You're everything to me

And if I leave you here forever
Forever I would stay
Cause I've been feeling so much better
With every single day
And if I could control the weather
The clouds and the rain
I know you're part of something deeper
You're better off this way

And if I leave you here forever
Forever I would stay
Cause I've been feeling so much better
With every single day
And if I could control the weather
The clouds and the rain
I know you're part of something deeper
You're better off this way

And now you left me here forever
Forever I will wait
I know someday we'll be together ---Lyrics submitted by jo ma.
