I'm on my last breath
who'd have thought it'd be me
I'm leaving behind
love
life
family
I'll say these last words I'll fight the pain from within
the bleeding won't stop
I'll stop to take this all in

When it comes down to this
A scene that we've seen before (A scene that we've seen before)
I won't let you go
I won't stand to watch
as these walls start
to fall apart

I'm falling away
Away from your arms
that kept me so close
to the things that I love
I'm holding it back
take me back to your heart
A place to remember
I'll always be yours

The warmth from your hands
as they hold me so close
I'm losing this fight
now I need you the most
I'll wait for the time
though my days running thin
I'll count down the clock
I'll stop to take this all in

When it comes down to this
A scene that we've seen before (A scene that we've seen before)
I won't let you go
I won't stand to watch
as these walls start
to fall apart

I'm falling away
Away from your arms
that kept me so close
to the things that I love
I'm holding it back
take me back to your heart
A place to remember
I'll always be yours

I'm falling away
Away from your arms
that kept me so close
to the things that I love
I'm holding it back
take me back to your heart
A place to remember
I'll always be yours

A place to remember 
I'll always be yours---Lyrics submitted by PapAjefF.
