Its the song of the redeemed 
Rising from the African plain 
Its the song of the forgiven 
Drowning out the Amazon rain 
The song of Asian believers
Filled with Gods holy fire
Its every tribe, every tongue, every nation 
A love song born of a grateful choir 

Its all Gods children singing 
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns, He reigns 
Its all Gods children singing 
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns, He reigns 

Let it rise above the four winds 
Caught up in the heavenly sound 
Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals 
To the faithful gathered underground 
Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation 
Some were meant to persist 
Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples 
None rings truer than this 

Its all Gods children singing 
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns, He reigns 
Its all Gods children singing 
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns, He reigns 
Its all Gods children singing 
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns, He reigns 
Its all Gods children singing 
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns, He reigns 

And all the powers of darkness 
Tremble at what theyve just heard 
Cause all the powers of darkness 
Cant drown out a single word 

When all Gods children sing out 
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns, He reigns 
All Gods children singing 
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns, He reigns

All God's people singing
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He reigns, he reigns
All God's people singing
Goly, glory, halleljah
He reigns, He reigns

Singing glory, glory 
Hallelujah He reigns, He reigns
All God's people singing
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He reigns, he reigns
All God's people singing
Goly, glory, halleljah
He reigns, He reigns

All God's people singing
Glory, glory, hallelujah
He reigns, He reigns
All God's children singing
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns, He reigns

All God's children singing
Glory, glory, hallelujah 
He reigns---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
