When did it become breaking a rule
To say your name out loud in school
When your names the only one that sets us free
When did it become incorrect
To speak the truth about life and death
When your life gave us all eternity

Even if it gets me convicted
Ill still be on my knees with my hands lifted

If serving yous against the law of man
If living out my faith in you is banned
Then Ill stand right before the jury

If saying I believe is out of line
If Im judged cause Im gonna give my life
To show the world the love that fills me
Then I want to be Guilty

Ill rise up and honor you
Ill testify to all the good you do
Cause your Grace and your Mercy have overtaken me

So even if it gets me convicted
Ill still be on my knees with my hands lifted

If serving yous against the law of man
If living out my faith in you is banned
Then Ill stand right before the jury

If saying I believe is out of line
If Im judged cause Im gonna give my life
To show the world the love that fills me
Then I want to be Guilty

Guilty by association
Guilty of being a voice proclaiming Your ways
Your truth
Your life
Ill pay the price to be your light---
