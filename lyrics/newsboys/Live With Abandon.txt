Chasing after this world makes me tired
Praisin my own name leaves me dry

Theres gotta be so much more to life than this
A higher calling that I missed
I want my life to count, every breath

I wanna live with abandon
Give You all that I am
Every part of my heart Jesus
I place in Your hands
I wanna live with abandon

Ill drop everything to follow You
Its only Your hands I hold onto

Theres gotta be more to life than this
A higher calling that I missed
I want my life to count, every breath

Im not looking back
Im done with that
Wanna give You all I have---
