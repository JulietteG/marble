Tuesday the third
I call this entry 'mistake'
Cheap imitation bought 
Life feels like a fake
A people person
Sunday's people annoy me
I'm going edgy 
Wednesday's title 'avoid me'

Chorus:
Breathe on me
Breathe the breath of God
Breathe on me
Til my heart is new
Breathe on me
Breathe the breath of life
Breathe on me
Til I love like you do

Thursday the fifth
I title 'drivers beware'
Tempered and mental and
I don't really care
I gave til I bled
You laughed when I fainted
Don't want to live this life
Bitter and tainted

Chorus (repeated 4 times)---Lyrics submitted by Pat.
