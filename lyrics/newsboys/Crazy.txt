You turned the world on its head with Your words
Said, the first will be last and the last will be first
You loved the traitor, those who spat in Your face
And You gave up a throne for a cross and a grave
Oh, I wanna be that radical
Oh, fearless and fanatical
Crazy
I dont care if the whole world calls me
Crazy
I dont care if it looks like Ive lost my mind
Im alive
To live a reckless, righteous, foolish life
Maybe
I was born to be crazy
You said the meek would inherit the earth
And the wise of the world came to call You absurd
You spoke of kingdoms that no eye has seen
And proclaimed Youre the way to eternity
Some say strange
Some say odd
I say child of the living God
Some say mad
Some say wrong
I say child of the living God---
