I'm forgiven because you were forsaken,
I'm accepted,you were condemned
I'm alive and well,your spirit is within me,
Because you died and rose again.
I'm forgiven because you were forsaken,
I'm accepted,you were condemned
I'm alive and well,your spirit is within me,
because you died and rose again

Amazing love,how can it be,that you my king should die for me?
Amazing love, And I know it's true,And it's my joy to honor you
In all I do,to honor you

I'm forgiven because you were forsaken,
I'm accepted,you were condemned
I'm alive and well,your spirit is within me,
Because you died and rose again

Amazing love,how can it be,that you my king should die for me?
Amazing love,I know it's true,And it's my joy to honor you
In all I do,to honor you
In all I do,to honor you.

You are my king
You are my king
Jesus you are my king
You are my king

Amazing love,how can it be,that you my king should die for me?
Amazing love,I know it's true,And it's my joy to honor you,
Amazing love,how can it be,that you my king should die for me?
Amazing love,I know it's true,And it's my joy to honor you,
In all I do,to honor you
In all I do,to honor you
In all I do,
Let me honor you---Lyrics submitted by Lillian Poremba.
