This is my story, this is my song
I have a hope thats stronger then the dust Im standing on
This is my anchor, my cornerstone
This is the anthem Ill be singing, till the Kingdom comes
I am committed, Im not ashamed
I pledge my allegiance to Jesus, My King
I am committed, got nothing to hide
Im not giving up, not selling out, Im in this for life
I am committed, to Christ
I am committed, to Christ
For all that Hes given, The price that He paid
Forever were freed by the power of His unshakable grace
For all of His children, His daughters and sons
This is the anthem well keep singing from the top of our lungs
To the One who gave it all
To the One who fights for us
To the One who took my suffering
In the name of love
This is our message
Our battlecry
So stand up and sing with me
I am committed---
