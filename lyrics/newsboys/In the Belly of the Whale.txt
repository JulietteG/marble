up to my ears in bitter tears
can't believe I'm sunk this low
as i walk the plankton in a sanctum
got outta dodge sailed on a bon-less bon voyage 
he sad north i headed south 
tossed over board 
good lord that's a really large mouth

[Chorus]
I'm sleeping with fishes here
(in the belly of the whale)
i'm highly nutritious here
(in the belly of the whale)

bad food lousy atmosphere
i don't want a bellyache
how long's this gonna take?


woke up this mornign kinda blue
thinkin through that age old question
how to exit a whales digestion?
it might behoove me to be heaved
head out like a human comet
(hmm, i wonder what rhymes with comet)


[Chorus]
I'm sleeping with fishes here
(in the belly of the whale)
i'm highly nutritious here
(in the belly of the whale)

i'm ready to re-appear
i don't want a belly ache
lord how long's this gonna take?


[bridge]
end times they coem rolling around
enzymes they come breakin us down to the core. 
good lord grants we all get a second chance

i'm one of the dishes here
(in the belly of the whale
they say i'm delicious here
(in the belly of the whale)
lord please make him chuck it all

it's a gut called in the belly of the whale
(i'm in the belly)
in the belly of the whale
(i'm in the belly)
in the belly of the whale
(i'm in the belly)
in the belly of the whale
(i'm in the belly)



In the belly of the whale
In an underwater jail
It's a tight squeeze.
It's a-gettin' to me,
But it's roomier
Than the tail.
Hey, sailor,
Got my flow free
Like a salmon to the sea
From the L.A. Symphony.
I'm a paddleboat
Paddlin' in their wake,
A fake free-styler,
But my unemployment pays.
I'm avoiding cliches
Like "whale of a tale" stale
Or "you can't keep
A good man down,"
'Cause you can
And I've been there, man.
But I've been expectorated.
I'm elated!
I'm free like Willie!
Happy Day!
Oops,
That's a bit of a cliche.
