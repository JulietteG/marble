Everybody needs somebody
To rely on (to rely on, realize)
Everybody needs somebodys
Shoulder to cry on (just to cry on, realize)
I wanna send you there
To assist (I wanna send you there)

GO...
FROM THE TOP OF THE WORLD
TO THE BOTTOM RUNG
TIL THE WORK IS DONE
I WANNA SEND YOU
GO...
FROM THE BREAK OF THE DAWN
TO THE AGES END
SOMEBODYS NEEDING A FRIEND
I WANNA SEND YOU

Everybody needs somebody
For the long ride (for the long ride, ride along)
Everybody needs somebody
Comin alongside (come alongside, side along)
Are you gonna lend a hand...
Or a fist? (I wanna send you there)

[Repeat Chorus]

Gonna send you out one by one
If I need it sung, can you sing it loud
Gonna send you two by two
Outta the ark, into the wild blue
Gonna come along by your side
Gonna send along my Spirit guide
Im gonna show you miracles
Cover the earth
Make disciples

[Repeat Chorus]

GO...
FROM THE TOP OF THE WORLD
TO THE BOTTOM RUNG
TIL THE WORK IS DONE
I WANNA SEND YOU
GO...
FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
TO THE NEAREST GAP
ALL OVER THE MAP
I WANNA SEND YOU---Lyrics submitted by nicky.
