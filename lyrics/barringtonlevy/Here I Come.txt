On the intercom Rosie tell me to come,
Said she didn't have a daughter, she did have a son,
She said the lift doesn't work, run up the stairs and come,
And if you don't come quick, you're not gonna see your son,
So I grab a bunch of rose, and I started to run,
Here I come! Whoah!

Two months later she said come and get your son,
'Cause I don't want your baby to come tie me down,
Because you are old, and I am young,
Yes while I'm young, yes I wanna have some fun,
Run me down! Whaoh, seen!

I'm broad, I'm broad, I'm broader then Broadway.
Yes I'm broad, I'm broad, I'm broader then Broadway.

When you go to volcano, it's like a stage show,
You have man that sling, DJ, and blow,
Pull it down the radio.. ooh.. seen!

On the intercom Rosie tell me to come,
Said she didn't have a daughter, she did have a son,
She said the lift doesn't work, run up the stairs and come,
And if you don't come quick, you're not gonna see your son,
So I grab a bunch of rose, and I started to run,
Here I come! Whoah!

Two months later she said come and get your son,
'Cause I don't want your baby to come tie me down,
Because you are old, and I am young,
Yes while I'm young, yes I wanna have some fun,
Run me down! Whoah, seen!

Extra size, extra size, extra sizer than sizeway.
Extra broad, extra broad, extra broader than Broadway.

I'm the intercover, rose and delical kind
On the intercom Rosie tell me to come,
Said she didn't have a daughter, she did have a son,
Here I come! Whoah, seen!

'Cause I'm broad, I'm broad, I'm broader then Broadway.
Yes I'm broad, I'm broad, I'm broader then Broadway.

Over the ocean and over the sea,
All of the girls dem are pose for me! (ohh.. wheee!)
Whoah, seen!
