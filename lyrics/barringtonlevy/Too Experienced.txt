She doesn't want me....... around
She's got something to hide
I think she want's a clown, someone to take for a ride....... 
What I keep telling her,

Chorus: 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll....... 
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll, 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride,
And I know it's not my foolish pride

She hates the site....... of me
because I turned her offer down
She's always saying we were meant to be
somehow she thought Id be her clown
And this is what I sing:

Chorus: 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll....... 
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll, 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride,
And I know it's not my foolish pride

She doesn't want me around
She gots something to hide, 
I think she wants a clown, someone to take
for a ride, this is what I sing

Chorus: 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll....... 
Too experienced for someone to rock and roll, 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride,
And I know it's not my foolish pride---Lyrics submitted by brian gidley.
