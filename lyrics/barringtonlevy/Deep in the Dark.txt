Deep in the dark
Secrets are unfolding
Things I only dreamed of
Happening to me

Deep in the dark
Messages are reaching me
Strange and sweet sensations
Are tantalising me

I see you in the light of day
I see you in a different way
I see you every day
Every day, every day
How you shine girl
Like the sun

I love you, I love you
So come on

Come on, come on
Yes I love you
Love you

Deep in the dark
Secrets are unfolding
Things I only dreamed of
Happening to me

Say
come on
I love you, I love you, I love you
All the time yeah yeah

So wont you come back to me

Deep in the dark
Mystery her claiming
Love I never thought could be mine
Even in a dream
Weeey

Deep in the dark..---Lyrics submitted by Simone Cesca.
