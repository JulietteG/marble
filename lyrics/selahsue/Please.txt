Im tired, so tired, of chasing the dreams
With tears in my eyes I realize that its running away
Its running away
But with all the wrong Ive done, how could love ever love me?
'Cause I've even tried, talking to the sky about it.
But theres not much to say
Not much to say

So please, please, please, help me
Give me some kind of sign
Please, please, please, please, please
I want to be somebody, somebody, I want someone to be mine
Please, please, please, please, please

The man, the man in the mirror, he wont even look at me
Well you may not believe it, but my own reflection
Told me I ought to be ashamed of myself
Oh yes he did
Im wasting my time, my time, my mind, my mind, my energy
Even let my body down on the bed
Oh yeah, but I cant seem to win for losing, cause dont nobody love me yet

So Im begging please, please, yeah, please, send me some kind of sign, please
I want, I want to be somebody, I want someone to be all mine
Im begging please, yeah, please, someone, please, please, someone please
I said, I want to be somebody, I want someone to be all mine
Someone, someone, I want someone
Sometimes I got to move along
I say hum---Lyrics submitted by Ins Costa.
