Once a day
Your voice is everything I need
And all the things you've done
Give me power to succeed
I felt so many times
But you pulled me through
But in time I find myself yeah
I hope you see that too

Cause when I feel scared
Sometimes I do
And when I feel scared
It seems that life is harder than I ever knew
Yeah when I feel scared
You are the only one
Who knows just what to say
So here am I to thank you

And hey there little girl
Wake up and see
And take your time to grow
Cause that is what you really need
And I cried so many times but
You pulled me through
And I know it sounds clich yeah
But I can't live without you

Cause when I feel scared
Sometimes I do
And when I feel scared
It seems that life is harder than I ever knew
Yeah when I feel scared
You are the only one
Who knows just what to say
So here am I to thank you
So here am I to thank you---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
