I fear real danger
This world ain't simple
But I'm strong, I know how to get out
And I'll find my way cause
Cause its love, real simple
And thats how it works

So wont you just give it up cause you dont understand
Big it up but you dont understand
And its really nice, but you dont understand
So big it up, cause you don't understand
Cause you don't understand baby

I feel its fallin' down, I know Ill catch it
You crazy world, crazy world, yeah
I feel real passionate
You feel the sun comes down
I'll make it shine, yeah
You crazy world, crazy world yeah

I can see your fear cause
This world aint simple
But Im strong, I know how to stay out
And Ill find my way cause
Cause its love, its love, its love, its love, its loving yeah

So wont you just give it up
Cause you dont understand
Big it up, but you dont understand
And its really nice, but you dont understand
So big it up, cause you don't understand
Cause you don't understand baby

I feel its fallin down, I know Ill catch it
You crazy world, crazy world, yeah.
I feel real passionate
You feel the sun comes down,
I'll make it shine, yeah
You crazy world, crazy world yeah

I feel its fallin down, I know Ill catch it
You crazy world, crazy world, yeah.
I feel real passionate
You feel the sun comes down,
I'll make it shine, yeah
You crazy world, crazy world yeah
Crazy world, crazy world yeah
Crazy world, crazy world yeah---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
