I need this
Is it a good time for you
And if its not just know
I may not be here when you need me

Sometimes I feel like I would die without you
And if its too early dont worry when I say Im sorry now
Hang on to this moment
It will be all over soon

Cause I know youll wait for me
Youll wait for me til I get home
Yes, I know youll wait for me
Youll wait for me til I get home

Is this what life is supposed to be about?
Sometimes its hard, but I will help you understand it somehow
The only thing that I want from you is trust
Together we will make it through this world
We must

Hang on to this moment
It will be all over soon

Cause I know youll wait for me
Youll wait for me til I get home
Yes, I know youll wait for me
Youll wait for me til I get home

But if I should fall
Then you should move on
All eyes watch out for you from up above
Now dont take this wrong
But you should move on
All eyes watch over you from up above

This could be the last time that I speak with you
Just in case lets make the best of what we have until its through

Cause I know youll wait for me
Youll wait for me til I get home
Yes, I know youll wait for me
Youll wait for me til I get home
I get home---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.
