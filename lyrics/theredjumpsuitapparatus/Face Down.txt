Hey girl you know you drive me crazy,
One look puts the rhythm in my hand,
Still I never understand why you hang around, 
I see whats goin' down.
Cover up with make up in the mirror,
Tell yourself it's never gonna happen again,
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you.

Do you feel like a man?
When you push her around?
Do you feel better now?
As she falls to the ground?
Well I'll tell you my friend,
One day this world's going to end,
As your lies crumble down, 
A new life she has found.

A pebble in the water makes ripple effect,
Every action in this world will bear a consequence,
If you wade around forever you will surely drown,
I see whats goin' down.
I see the way you go and say your right again,
Say your right again,
Heed my lecture.

Do you feel like a man?
When you push her around?
Do you feel better now?
As she falls to the ground?
Well I'll tell you my friend,
One day this world's going to end,
As your lies crumble down, 
A new life she has found.

Face down in the dirt, 
She said,
This doesnt hurt, 
She said, 
I've finally had enough.
Face down in the dirt, 
She said, 
This doesnt hurt, 
She said, 
I've finally had enough!
One day,
She will,
Tell you, 
That she has had enough!
It's coming round again!

Do you feel like a man?
When you push her around?
Do you feel better now?
As she falls to the ground?
Well I'll tell you my friend,
One day this world's going to end,
As your lies crumble down, 
A new life she has found.

Do you feel like a man?
When you push her around?
Do you feel better now?
As she falls to the ground?
Well I'll tell you my friend,
One day this world's going to end,
As your lies crumble down, 
A new life she has found.

Face down in the dirt, 
She said,
This doesnt hurt, 
She said, 
I've finally had enough.---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
