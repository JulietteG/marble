Don't tell me that this is your last chance to change
cuz if you do, than you would be telling a lie but

I warned you
what could happen if you should decide
to live your life from the 9 to 5
and I mourn you
for the detail that is left unsaid
is a reminder of the time you bled

return to days when you knew you still felt alive
reveal the way you felt when
you could look inside

they've sold you
everything you need to fix you up
and you feel good now but you can't wake up
they found a way to reassure you
that everything would be okay(screaming)
reach out today now I implore you to remember who you are

return to days when you knew
you still felt alive
reveal the way you felt when
you could look inside

so you felt it, but you don't know, why you can't explain at all
why you felt it
cuz you don't know, no you don't know

break the walls between building atrophy
causing all your problems to recede
break the walls between
(break the walls between)
causing all your pain
(causing all your pain)
you'll never learn

return to days when you knew you still felt alive
reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

Take Back
The beat in your heart
Why Fight
When you can't be bought

Take Back
The beat in your heart
Why Fight
When you can't be bought

Take Back
The beat in your heart
Why Fight
When you can't be bought

Take Back
The beat in your heart
Why Fight
When you can't be bought

Take Back
The beat in your heart
Why Fight
When you can't be bought---Lyrics submitted by zella.
