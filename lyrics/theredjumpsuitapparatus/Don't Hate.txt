So you think you can do better

I'm not good enough for you, I'm not seen enough for you
I'm not anything

I don't scream enough for you, I don't sing enough for you
I'm not anything

That's the way it goes when you're on top

I don't bleed enough for you, I don't see enough for you
I'm not anything

(Chorus) 
You can do you
'Cause I'ma do me
And there's not a damn thing that you will achieve
You're stuck in your place
So take your best shot, aim straight for my heart
(I'm not playing this game)
You can live in your shame
I don't fear anything

I don't see enough for you, I don't bleed enough for you
I'm not anything

I don't sing enough for you, I don't scream enough for you
I'm not anything

(Chorus) 
You can do you
'Cause I'ma do me
And there's not a damn thing that you will achieve
You're stuck in your place
So take your best shot, aim straight for my heart
(I'm not playing this game)
You can live in your shame
I don't fear anything

So take your best shot, aim straight for my heart
(I'm not playing this game)

You can live in your shame, I don't fear anything
No

So you think you could do better
So you think you could do better
No
No

So take your best shot, aim straight for my heart
(I'm not playing this game)
You can live in your shame, I don't fear anything
No
So take your best shot, aim straight for my heart
(I'm not playing this game)
You can live in your shame, I don't fear anything
No

So you think you could do better---Lyrics submitted by Ray Lazor.
