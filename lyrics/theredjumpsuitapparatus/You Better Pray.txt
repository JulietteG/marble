(whoa,oh yeah)

I see the sweat is dripping
That's because you know just what I'm thinking
Don't look back it's me who follows
And there ain't nothing from me you can borrow

You like to hide behind lies
But we see through your disguise
It's not a threat or a curse
Just a proper verse

I'm gonna make you let go
Of what you tried to withhold
And I can promise it won't be long
Yes I can promise

Boy, you better pray(ay ay a)
We don't seek you out, no no
You better pray

You think the war is over
I've only shown you the tip of the iceberg
And you rely upon your lawyers
But at night when you sleep does it bother you?

You like to hide behind lies
But we see through your disguise
It's not a threat or a curse
Just a proper verse

I'm gonna make you let go
Of what you tried to withhold
And I can promise it won't be long
Yes I can promise

Boy, you better pray(ay ay a)
We don't seek you out, no no
You better hope(oh oh ho)
We might lose control, no no whoa

Is this good enough for you man?
Is this good enough for you man?
Is this good enough for you man?
Is this good enough for you man?
(Is this good enough for you man?)

Boy, you better pray(ay ay a)
We don't seek you out, no no
You better hope(oh oh ho)
We might lose control, no no
(whoa,oh yeah)---Lyrics submitted by Kitty.
