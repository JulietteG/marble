The moon is shining bright
The mood is feeling right
I'll kiss you on your neck
People will stare but we won't care

We're high above the ground
We're nowhere to be found
Empowered by adrenaline
Feel I've been born again

Again, I am repeating myself
And I know it is kind for you
To sit and pretend

[Chorus:]
Damn regret, I'll try to forget
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm refined
Cast my line to see what's behind
Did you think you'd persuade me to let you go?

I'm wishing you were here
My weakness is my fear
Alone I am myself
No reason left for me to care

Distracted by the sound
I hear footsteps all around
Empowered by adrenaline
Feel I've been born again

Again, I am repeating myself
And I know it is kind for you
To sit and pretend

[Chorus]

You're the only one I turn to
When I feel like no one's there
And when I'm lonely in my darkest hour
You give me the power
To sit and pretend---Lyrics submitted by Sumith.
