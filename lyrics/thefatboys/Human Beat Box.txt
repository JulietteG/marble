Gonna rock the beat box in a fresh funky rhythm

Now with a mind blowing body rocking D-3 MCs
To all the homeboys and the young ladies
Were gonna rock a fierce beat with the Human Beat Box
And to the sucker MCs: jump off our jocks
His DJ name is Grandmaster Doc Nice
And well repeat it if we have to  once or twice
Were gonna take it from the bottom and straight to the top
So check it out party people  its the Human Beat Box

And as we told you before, he is the grandmaster
The man with the beats to cause a disaster
The man whos overtop, guaranteed to rock
From a positive source, its the Human Beat Box
With a million watts of power coming out his mouth
Making all the young ladies want to scream and shout
With a thousand beats for every day of the week
So come on Beat Box  play one for me

You now the passion is great
The beats are clear
The people are drawn
From far and near
Were fierce
Fresh
Kicking it live
And were pumped at the party from 9 to 5
So if you want a sound thatll fit you to a tee
Listen to the sounds of the Disco 3---Lyrics submitted by Micah Fraim, CPA.
