Come let us make bricks and burn them hard,
We'll build a city with a tower for the world
and climb so we can reach anything we may propose,
anything at all

Build me up, tear me down
like a skyscraper
Build me up, then tear down
These joining walls
So they can't climb at all

I know why you tore it down that day
You thought, that if you got caught we'd all go away,
Like a spoiled little baby who can't come out to play,
You had your revenge

Build me up, tear me down
like a skyscraper
Build me up, then tear down
these joining walls
So they can't climb at all

Well madness reigned and paradise drowned
When Babel's walls came crashing down
Now the echoes roar for a story writ ["for a story told" is the live version]
that was hardly understood
and never any good

Build me up, tear me down
like a skyscraper
Build me up, then tear down
these joining walls
So they can't climb at all

Build me up [x2]---Lyrics submitted by mike schuhlein.
