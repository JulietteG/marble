What am i thinking, if i'm not thinking about you? 
Nothing. 
What am i feeling, if my heart doesn't feel the truth? 
Nothing. 

This is a love, that I've never known 
And it's got a strangle hold on me 
This is a love, that makes me believe 
I just wanna remind you, lady! 

You're my everything, 
You're my everything, 
You're my everything, 
Girl, you're the air that i breathe 
You're my everything, 
You're my everything, 
You're my, You're my 
everything 

What am i loving, Girl if i'm not loving you? 
Nothing. 
What are we losing, if we're dreaming for me and you? 
Nothing. 

This is a love, that I've never known 
And it's got a strangle hold on me 
This is a love, that makes me believe 
I just wanna remind you, lady! 

You're my everything, 

You're my everything, 
You're my everything, 
Girl, you're the air that i breathe 
You're my everything, 
You're my everything, 
You're my, You're my 
everything 

I give it all, and even lose control 
If we can both close our eyes and just dream 
If i need more, girl i swear that i'll find it in me 
Oh, Oh, Oh 

You're my everything, 
You're my everything, 
You're my everything, 
Girl, you're the air that i breathe 
You're my everything, 
You're my everything, 
You're my, You're my 
everything 

You're my, You're my 
You're my, You're my 
You're my, You're my 
Everything.---Lyrics submitted by Chenoa.
