when your love is pouring like the rain
i close my eyes and it's gone again
when will i get the chance to say "i love you"
i pretend that you're already mine
that my heart ain't breaking every time
i look into your eyes
if only 
i can get through this
if only i can get through this
if only i can get through this
god, god 
gotta help me get through this

i gotta get through this
i gotta get through this
i gotta make it, gotta make it, gotta make it through
said i'm gonna get through this
i'm gonna get through this
i gotta take my, gotta take my mind off of you

give me just a second then i'll be alright
surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
give me til tomorrow then i'll be okay
just another day and then i'll hold you tight

when your love is pouring like the rain
i close my eyes and it's gone again
wil i get the chance to say i love you
i pretend that you're already mine
that my heart ain't breakin every time
i look into your eyes
if only i can get through this
if only i can get through this
if only i can get through this
god, god 
gotta help me get through this
woah yeah

i gotta get through this,
i gotta get through this
i gotta make it, gotta make it, gotta make it through
said i'm gonna get through this
i'm gonna get through this
i gotta take my, gotta take my mind off of you

give me just a second then i'll be alright
surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
give me til tomorrow then i'll be okay
just another day and then i'll hold you tight

when your love is pouring like the rain
i close my eyes and it's gone again
wil i get the chance to say i love you
i pretend that you're already mine
that my heart ain't breakin every time
i look into your eyes
if only i can get through this
if only i can get through this
if only i can get through this
god, god 
gotta help me get through this

i gotta get through this,
i gotta get through this
i gotta make it, gotta make it, gotta make it through
said i'm gonna get through this
i'm gonna get through this
i gotta take my, gotta take my mind off of you

give me just a second then i'll be alright 
surely one more moment couldn't break my heart.---Lyrics submitted by melanie.
