I'm a young married man and I'm tired of my life
For lately I married an ailing young wife
She does nothing all day, only sit down and sigh
Saying I wish to the Lord that I only could die

Chorus:
Oh Doctor dear Doctor, oh Doctor de Jong
Your cod liver oil is so pure and so strong
I'm afraid of my life, I'll go down in the soil
If my wife don't stop drinking your cod liver oil

Till a friend of my own came to see me one day
And he told me my wife was just pining away
But he afterwards told me that she would get strong
If I'd buy her a bottle from Doctor de Jong

(Chorus)

So I bought her a bottle, 'twas just for to try
And the way that she scoffed it you'd swear she was dry
I bought her another, it went just the same
Till I own she's got cod liver oil on the brain

(Chorus)

My house it resembles a big doctor's shop
With bottles and bottles from bottom to top
And when in the morning the kettle's a-boil
You'd swear it was singing out "Cod Liver Oil!"

(Chorus) ---Lyrics submitted by Jay Imerman.
