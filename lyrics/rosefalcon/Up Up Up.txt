Get ready or not 
Cause here I come
Dance dance dance 
Have some fun
654 321 
Get up get up

Oh no 
Never ever gonna stop
Try to fly and if I drop
Not gonna quit
Get up get up get up 
Stand back 
I'm gonna make some noise
Sing until they hear my voice 
Can't keep me down
Get up get up

Get ready or not 
Cause here I come
Dance dance dance 
Have some fun
654 321 
Get up get up

Get up up up
Whoa whoa
Up up up

Rain falls
Down on their parade
Lemons into lemonade
Can't slow me down
No way no way no way
Yesterday is in the past
Revolt
Tomorrow's coming fast
All you got is now
Get up get up

Get ready or not 
Cause here I come
Dance dance dance 
Have some fun
654 321 
Get up get up

Get up up up
Whoa whoa
Up up up 
Whoa whoa
Up up up
Whoa whoa
Up up up 
Whoa whoa
Up up up

Hey you 
Don't let 'em see you frown
Come on turn it upside down
Don't ever quit
Get up get up 
When life puts you to the test
There's nothing better than your best
Show 'em what you got
You got a lot
Show 'em what you got
Get up get up

Get up up up
Whoa whoa
Up up up
Whoa whoa
Up up up
Whoa whoa
Up up up
Whoa whoa

Up up up
Higher higher 
Up up up
Scores on fire
Up up up 
Whoa whoa
Up up up

Get ready or not 
Cause here I come
Dance dance dance 
Have some fun
654 321 
Get up get up

Get up up up
Whoa whoa

Up up up 
Whoa whoa 
Up up up 
Whoa whoa
Up up up 
Whoa whoa
