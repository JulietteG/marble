I wouldn't be here tonight with my head in my hands 
Trying to hold back the tears again 
I wouldn't be missing you 
You wouldn't be gone 
No, i wouldn't by trying to find a way to be strong 

[Chorus:]
If love had a heart 
It wouldn't say goodbye 
Wouldn't be so cruel, so damn unkind 
If love had a heart, then it wouldn't break mine 
If love had a heart, then it wouldn't break mine 

No I wouldn't have heard that you found someone else 
Or be looking in the mirror and hating myself 
I wouldn't be losing sleep, I wouldn't be up 
All night burning all of these pictures of us 

[Chorus]

Why did you have to make me fall so deep 
Give me something that I couldn't keep 
Lift me up and then let me down so hard 

[Repeat Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Michael morris.
