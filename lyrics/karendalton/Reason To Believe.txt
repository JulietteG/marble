If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe it's all true

Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
still I look for a reason to believe

If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way to leave the past behind

Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give everything of myself

If I listen long enough to you
I find a way to believe that its all true
knowing that you lied straight faced while i cried
still ill look to find a reason to believe---Lyrics submitted by Caylah Leas.
