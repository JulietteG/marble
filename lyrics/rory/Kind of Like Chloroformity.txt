Cheers to another one
Cheers to my discontentment
You wouldn't know a good thing if you saw it
And
We've been marching to the same beat
For so long
For so long now
It's beginning to tire my feet
And it seems you missed the point completely
And things aren't always what they seem to be
(What they seem to be)
What they seem to be
This is just a nightmare
Just a dream
Psychosomatic evaluation
This is just a trip of the imagination
This is just a nightmare
Just a dream
Psychosomatic evaluation
This is just a trip of the imagination

So, watch your step
The planks are rotting beneath your path
And as you take your last breath
And grip the rope
We've been marching to the same beat
For so long
For so long now
it's beginning to tire my feet
And it seems you missed the point completely
And things aren't always what they seem to be
What they seem to be
This is just a nightmare
Just a dream
Psychosomatic evaluation
This is just a trip of the imagination
This is just a nightmare
Just a dream
Psychosomatic evaluation
This is just a trip of the imagination

I'm still trapped by my own delusion
Create your own demise
I'm still trapped by my own delusion
Create your own demise
Don't ever say I told you so
This is just your nightmare
So f***ing let it go
We've been marching to the same beat
For so long
For so long now
It's beginning to tire my feet
And it seems you missed the point completely
This is just a nightmare
Just a dream
Psychosomatic evaluation
This is just a trip of the imagination
This is just a nightmare 
Just a dream
Psychosomatic evaluation
This is just a dream
Just a dream---Lyrics submitted by -x-.
