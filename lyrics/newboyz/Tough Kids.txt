Born to make it alone from the skids
Dont take it for more than it is
Cuz were tough kids
We are tough kids
You already know, you already know,
Come on
You already know, you already know,
Come on
You already know, you already know,
Come on
You already know, you already know

Dont be sayin they gon help me and still be bluffing
So if you aint gonna hate on me, dont tell me nothing
Heard you lyin on me, little man, better tell the truth
Im not your clone, but I am still ahead of you
Too cool to care, screw new suits for douche dudes
Rule blind ref to the def, what did you do
Testing me trust me, you lucky Im for you
If hip hop is dead then I must be immortal
While I was on the road spending nights with dancers
You was at home talking bout how tight my pants is
They throwin all these shots and they think its gonna rattle me
My haters Pepto Bismol brings shit outta me
Like ever since a kid I knew the top was where I had to be
The sky is the limit and Im makin fun of gravity
Ill fight it on me with no sword maybe with no gun
Try to stop me, you wont make it
Man, maybe it was cuz I was

Born to make it alone from the skids
Dont take it for more than it is
Cuz were tough kids
We are tough kids
We are tough kids
Here I come

Im a tough kid proven my actions are foolish
I spit dumb bars like boy thats stupid
What is he ruthless have a brain use it
Havin an illusion Ima go how you get
You better watch out if you walk the streets
Cuz if you aint got money then talk is cheap
You wanna walk with me talk with me bark with me spark me
Boy I know Im better cuz my cheddar got calories
Got my own squad ran my name like they marry me
We the best now and there is really no comparedy
All ya do is better me like bowin on the floor
Im a tough kid code name Kids Next Door
I dont take no shit, we dont take no shit
All my n*ggas on my team they dont take no shit
Bring em out cuz Im goin in like WOW
You n*ggas so surprised, surprise a beat down

Born to make it alone from the skids
Dont take it for more than it is
Cuz were tough kids
We are tough kids
We are tough kids---Lyrics submitted by Brooklyn.
