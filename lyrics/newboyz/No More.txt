BeN J:: So What You sayin` is my ego's to big to admit that i messed up? Man why you always trippin`? Fuck it. I messed up. Im sorry. Not simpin`. Nah scratch that i meant it. Im tired of this lyin`, this cheatin`, cryin`. The difference. What you trynna make? And i cant be mad at that. I was blind to the fact that you always had my back. And i noticed that after i saw you cryin`. The old me is dead now have a moment of silence.

[Chorus]

We fuss, We fight, We Cry and I aint trynna hurt you no more. We fight, we cry and I aint trynna hurt you no more x2 and I aint trynna hurt you no more x2. Gurl I aint trynna hurt you no more.

LeGacy:: It kinda sorta somewhat seem like every single night. Your an inch closer to leavin` after every single fight. I keep screamin` what im thinkin` with out ever thinkin` twice. Bout` the reason why I argue when I barely think im right. She always mentionin` how she so sick of my inconsiderence. Like christmas when I ditched her then I kicked it with a different chick. I pictured if this situation switched i`d loose it. Apologizes is to repetitive imma just prove it.

[Chorus]

We fuss, We fight, We Cry and I aint trynna hurt you no more. We fight, we cry and I aint trynna hurt you no more x2 and I aint trynna hurt you no more x2. Gurl I aint trynna hurt you no more.

O.N.E.:: I aint trynna hurt ya. I just wanna love you girl. You get bad sometimes but you still my baby. Why you wanna walk out the door and give up everything that we`ve been fightin` for. Whoa! See i promise this time imma change girl. No more lies, no more cheatin`, no more games girl. Im just trynna be the one for you and im doin` it all for you. Give me one more chance. Let me be the man. I could be the one you need. I dont know what i would do with out you girl im incomplete.
