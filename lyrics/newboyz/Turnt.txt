Haha yea uh aye... New Boyz
I'm turnt up [x7]
And I don't give a

[Verse 1:]
I'm turnt up but you ain't know
It's a young fly nigga from tha 310
I rap I jerk and I have to sneeze I'm making things with this paper like I'm Japanese
Spit game so nasty no water can cleanse me
Like I'm so fly even swaggerz offend me
Rock a Phil one time then I change
Like Obama
I'm getting so cocky I'm a start rocking condoms
Know what? hold up
Lemme show these hoes up I'm so turnt up I'm talking backwards like yoda
And ma words kinda slur but I still got game
Aw you got a prepaid? well I still got AIM
Just got a new kick and I keep it with me
It's Ben Jamin but the E is a 3 for me but I'm a keep it in ma pocket for it end up gone.
Cause I'm too turnt up bitch sing ma song

[Chorus:]
I'm turnt up I'm I'm turnt up jus lost ma phone and drop my cup They stole ma whip and now I'm stuck but it's over it's done I'm a still go dumb like I'm turnt up (I'm turnt up) and I'm turnt up (I'm turnt up)
Like I'm turnt up (I'm turnt up) I'm turnt, I'm I'm turnt up (I'm turnt up)

[Verse 2:]
I'm turnt up yup just as much as I wanna be
Goin so dumb that tha nerds make in fun of me
These girls dancing on me but they really wasn't wanting me
Until I said I'm Ben J then they cornered me

She was like can you jerk I know that you ain't afraid, I'm too turnt up I just do the BEN J, lyk left leg out right leg out feeln gone girl I can take you to my house, stairs to high we can get up on my couch, clothes off damn we can get it on right now, I was like do you gotta rubber, she was like uhh no but we can still do it, I was like uuhh no but it's kinda late girl I think you gotta go, she yelled at me you a JERK and I said I know
