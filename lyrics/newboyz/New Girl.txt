[Intro: Legacy]
Aye, you could be my new girl
Said, you could be my new girl
New Boyz

[Verse One: Legacy]
To keep it a hundred,
I'm ready for the next chick,
My soon-to-be ex chick,
About to hit the exit,
And right after she leave, I leave the key under the mat
When you feeling kinda lonely,
You  be free to come and chat
you know, you heard them effin' rumours
Like I beap and leave
But straight drop, that's just gossip, TMZ
Guess the principle is I don't give no referrals
Check into my district,
You could be the new girl
Aye ..

[Pre-Chorus]
I have so many girls that fade away,
In my past, that I don't think it's safe to say
my laugh, but I think that change today
You made me think in a major way
You could be ..

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
Out with the old and in with the new girl

[Verse Two: Ben J]
Ben J
I guess I seen the beauty of my life,
Cause she was a beast
A typical freak, she made it with me
How did she end up being caught up,
Ballin' my world
Cause now I just imagine, baby you could be my new girl
No jokes, no games
I feelin' you a whole lot
I ran into you
And no turns, it was a road block
Thinkin' to myself, I had one in th past
That didn't last, a chick with no class
It was so bad
Damn, and now we in 2009
And I'm tryna make you my summer girl,
You got a dope mind
Let's go to Texas, Arkansas, Arizona
We can go to Michigan or live life in California, my new girl

[Pre-Chorus]
I have, so many girls that fade away
In my past, that I don't think it's safe to say
I have, but I think that changed today
You made me think in a major way
You could be ..

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
Out with the old, and in with the new girl

[Bridge]
Everytime I look into your eyes
I wanna feel fireworks on my insides
You be here for me when I don't know what to do
I need a new girl, ooh
I need a girl to give me some good lovin'
Cause I'm known as McLovin'
I need a girl that's fresh and fly
We can stay together through the end of time

[Pre-Chorus]
I have, so many girls that fade away
In my past, that I don't think it's safe to say
I have, but I think that changed today
You made me think in a major way
You could be .. 

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
Out with the old and in with the new girl

Yeah
Aye, aye, said I'm lookin' for my new girl
Said I'm lookin' for my new girl
New Boyz

[Chorus]
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
My, my, my, my, my
You could be my new girl
Out with the old and in with the new girl---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
