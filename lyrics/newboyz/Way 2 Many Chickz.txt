I met this girl named shanell from ATL
an actress and a singer she was paid in mills
we 1st spoke, thought i found a bad chick on da spot
til i noticed that her breath smelled like fat kids in a box

i knew this girl named jill who wanted my baby
i always told her no but i ain't know she was crazy
i was in there had a bust i was like wait jill
she put a gun to my head and was like stay still

met this girl named lanice a freak but ugly
she stripped for me once and her butt cheeks was musty
every time it got loud she would sneak a small fart
chick passed so much gas she could make a car start

knew this chick named shirley she acted so perky
but little did i know that the chick had herpes
tried to kiss me in my sleep i got up a screamed
chick had a cold sour dat looked like john mccain

now im sittin on my couch thinkin how to get
to the point were i cant even get a decent soundin chick
one more try to holla imma mase em in the lip
never thought it'd be bad that i got way too many chickz

CHORUS:
i got way too many chicks (5x's)
but if i had a dollar for the good ones i wouldnt make shit
i got way too many chicks (5x's)
but if i had a dollar for the good ones i wouldnt make shit

i met this one chick named miley jets
i was so fascinated by miley's breasts
she said she had a gift it was prolly sex
but when she took her wig off she looked like kanye west

i met this girl named tica she was not no groupie
she was a black belt starred in kung-fu movies
i liked her but i had to dump her on the 2nd date
cuz every time she moved her mouth her words would come a second late

met this chick name evett who was into sex
got her naked in an hour then we hit the bed
she was twitchin so much like she had the best
i found out the real reason cuz she had teretts

i met this one teacher name mrs. chandallier
she was so bomb that i was skippin lunch to see her
til she snuck up from behind me and i kicked her out of fear
sound like ja rule was tryna whisper in my ear

now im sittin on the couch just thinkin how to get
to the point when i cant even get a decent soundin chick
once more try to holla imma mase em in the lip
never thought it'd be bad that i got way too many chickz

CHORUS:
i got way too many chicks (5x's) 
but if i had a dollar for the good ones i wouldnt make shit
i got way too many chicks (5x's)
but if i had a dollar for the good ones i wouldnt make shit---Lyrics submitted by TOKYO.
