(knock out, knock out)

She Aint Gone Tie Me Down
She Aint Gone Tie Me Down
She aint gone tie me down,
While you on the road,
Buying all the shirts,
All the hats, all the clothes,
Whatchu' want right now?
What up right now?
I think you need to close your mouth,
Cause you aint gone tie me down
Tie me down(repeat 2x)
You aint gone tie me down

Know we been together for a minute,
But uhhh, its kinda been forever since we been in,
The kinda situation not involving other women
And its pretty obvious that your kinda tripping,
Like who the hell is this bitch?,
Lookin a hot mess,
What you fell for this chick?
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it,
I'm like, you need to go somewhere else with this shit,
Because I aint gone put up with you,
Talkin bout how she make you uncomfortable,
Like I mean, shit im only seventeen and uhhm ahh Perfect couple is only in a dream,
And right now im pretty much away for this Relationships?,
I think we should wait for it,
I mean later we could try things out but not right now,

She aint gone tie me down,
While you on the road,
Buying all the shirts,
All the hats, all the clothes,
Whatchu' want right now?
What up right now?
I think you need to close your mouth,
Cause you aint gone tie me down
Tie me down(repeat 2x)
You aint gone tie me down

Ha ha,
ayee girl what up?,
No Im not going make a scene,
But you cant tie me down like a pair of shoe strings,
Yea you cute. so what?,
But lets get it through your head,
Yea we make love, sex, weed all in the bed,
Its the best thing I love about you,
But things dont change,
While im not faithful,
You be fillin all pain ,
Now you stuck like a stain and i cant believe that,
Baby girl want hundreds i aint tryna do that,
Theres too much girls and i aint lettin go,
Cause my life is great,
And you aint nothing but a hoe,
Yea you come to my shows and your very supportive,
Just show me a camera or my show recorded,
it was nice,
But Im Suprised That your still standing here,
Ay yea you know im a man,
And i have no feelings,
Im a start it from the top,
Girl this aint no lovin,
Im a new boy girl so,


She aint gone tie me down,
While you on the road,
Buying all the shirts,
All the hats, all the clothes,
Whatchu' want right now?
What up right now?
I think you need to close your mouth,
Cause you aint gone tie me down
Tie me down(repeat 2x)
You aint gone tie me down

She aint gone tie me down,
While you on the road,
Buying all the shirts,
All the hats, all the clothes,
Whatchu' want right now?
What up right now?
I think you need to close your mouth,
Cause you aint gone tie me down
Tie me down(repeat 2x)
You aint gone tie me down.---Lyrics submitted by terriuna.
