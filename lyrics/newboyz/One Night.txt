[Intro]
New Boyz (New Boyz)
Hey (Hey, Hey)
Ay (Hey, Hey)
But it was just a one night..

[Chorus]
She thought I said I loved her (she thought I said I loved her)
I think I said I love you (I think I said I love you)
But baby, I'm hungover (but baby, I'm hungover)
and you need to realize (realize)
that this was just a one night stand 

[Legacy]
I'm turnt up
just hit the function
lookin' for a bad bitch, 
with the Gucci pumps and shades,
trying to find the one that'll come in
just get to lunch, then just get to humpin'
Checkmark, there goes one, no acne, with her hair all done
got her makeup on, bracelet on, and the heels make me wanna take that home
Should I take her to my room? Quick think. 
I took her to my room, and we hit sinks, counters, dressers, sheets, stairs.
We got done, told her "You can sleep here."
The next day, I woke up at 12, at noon, I rolled over, and I screamed, "Who the hell are you?"
The fat chick said, "Damn, don't remember me baby?"
This shit crazy.

[Chorus]
She thought I said I loved her (she thought I said I loved her)
I think I said I love you (I think I said I love you)
But baby, I'm hungover (but baby, I'm hungover)
and you need to realize (realize)
that this was just a one night stand 

[Ben J]
I'm turnt up
Yeah, I know how good 
I get a chick who wanna kick it, now she wanna hit it
I don't blame her, 
She know what's up, I said "wussup"
She came with the pumps, and she turned me up
She was cute, make up, nails and feet done,
long hair, arched back
Now that's the reason
To give it
You know what's up, lil' mami
We both faded, feelin' all types of naughty
She wanna wait to go for a fourth
But I only got one night, and my source
I endorce the fact that 
attack the drink in me, the freak in me
The kink in her, she came to see me,
and I ain't gonna stand around, I'mma take her to the telly,
We can both roll around in, haha, and I ain't gonna let her in
I'mma kick her ass out  it's a one night stand (Haha!)

[Chorus]
She thought I said I loved her (she thought I said I loved her)
I think I said I love you (I think I said I love you)
But baby, I'm hungover (but baby, I'm hungover)
and you need to realize (realize)
that this was just a one night stand 

[Legacy]
(A one night) 
Ayy
(This was a one night stand)
Your breath stink
I never liked you
Cause, baby, I was just drunk.

[Chorus]
She thought I said I loved her (she thought I said I loved her)
I think I said I love you (I think I said I love you)
But baby, I'm hungover (but baby, I'm hungover)
and you need to realize (realize)
that this was just a one night stand
