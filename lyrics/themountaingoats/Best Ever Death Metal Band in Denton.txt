the best ever death metal band out of Denton
were a couple of guys 
who'd been friends since grade school 
one was named Sirus and the other was Jeff 
and they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom 

the best ever death metal band out of Denton 
never settled on a name 
but the top three contenders 
after weeks of debate 
were Satan's Fingers and the Killers and the Hospital Bombers

Jeff and Sirus believed in their hearts
they were headed for stage lights and lear jets
and fortune and fame
so in script that made prominent use of a pentagram
they stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names

this is how Sirus got sent to the school
where they told him he'd never be famous
and this was why Jeff
in the letters he'd write to his friend
helped develop a plan to get even

when you punish a person for dreaming his dream
don't expect him to thank or forgive you
the best ever death metal band out of denton
will in time both outpace and outlive you

hail satan
hail satan 
tonight hail satan
hail, hail---Lyrics submitted by Public.
