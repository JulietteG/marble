I hope that our few remaining friends give up on trying to save us
I hope we come up with a fail safe plot to piss off the dumb few that forgave us
I Hope the fences we mended fall down beneath their own weight 
I hope we hang on past the last exit
I hope its already too late 

I hope the junk yard a few blocks from here, someday burns down
I hope that the rising black smoke carries me far away and I never come back to this town again 
In my life
I hope I lie, and tell everyone you were a good wife
And I hope you die
I hope we both die

I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
I hope it bleeds all day long 

Our friends say its darkest before the sun rises
Were pretty sure theyre all wrong
I hope it stays dark forever
I hope the worst isnt over
I hope you blink before I do
I hope I never get sober

And I hope when you think of me years down the line you cant find a good thing to say
I hope that if I find the strength to walk out youll stay the hell out of my way. 

I am drowning
There is no sign of land
You are coming down with me
Hand and unloveable hand
I hope you die 
I hope we all die---Lyrics submitted by allison.
