On the morning when I woke up without you, for the first time
I felt free
and I felt lonely
and I felt scared

and I began to talk to myself,
almost immediately,
not being used to being
the only person there
hm-hm.

The first time I made coffee for just myself, I made too much I think
but I drank it all
just cause you headed
and I let things go to waste.

and I started wondering though the house
like a little boy lost at the mall
and an astronaut could have seen
the hunger in my eyes from space.

And I sang: "Oh,
"What do I do?
"What do I do?
"What do I do?
"What do I do, without you?

On the morning when I woke up without you, for the first time
I was cold
so I put on a sweater
and I turned up the heat

And the walls began to close in
and I felt so sad and frightened
I practically ran from the living room
out into the street

And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend
And the world in its cold way started coming alive
And I stood there like a bussinessman waiting for a train
And I got ready for the future to arrive

And I sang: "Oh,
"What do I do?
"What do I do?
"What do I do?
"What do I do, without you?---Lyrics submitted by Public.
