I wanna be part of the gang, in with the crowd, (?) with the mob
face down, to the ground, and go with the flow
I wanna be top of the slop, cream of the crop, right off the top,
Promise to be on my best behavior
And i'll be sure

Big town lights, walk with me, me and my company
all the way home
and Jesus loves me, this i know
I read it on a sticker, I was driving slow
Said i had a friend in need, but it's just not the same

I just wanna be right by them
I just wanna be their friend
I just want to be liked by them

Staring at the moon, I got no where to be, and nothing to see
Got my (?) friend in the TV, and a place just for me
and Jesus loves me, this i know
I read it on a sticker, I was driving slow
Said i had a friend in need, but it's just not the same

I just wanna be right by them
I just wanna be their friend
I just want to be liked by them---Lyrics submitted by es.
