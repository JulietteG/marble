Time, it's eating me alive
Unable to rewind
Sink deeper while I'm climbing
Never to arrive

I gave you everything
But still you need to feed
And underneath it all I'm screaming out

Just carry on, just prove me wrong
I know that I'm dying right now
And it seems that I'm so far gone
But not for long
I'll just be strong and keep knowing
That now I will overtake you

You just want what you can use
Won't risk what you can lose
Play the victim while abusing
Anyone you choose

A painful consequence
Of standing on you lies
I'm barely breathing but 
I'm screaming out

Just carry on, just prove me wrong
I know that I'm dying right now
And it seems that I'm so far gone
But not for long
I'll just be strong and keep knowing
That now I will overtake you

(Just carry on)
I know that I'm dying right now 
And it seems that I'm so far gone
(Overtake you)
I'll just be strong and keep knowing
That now I will overtake you

You come to get me 
But you'll end up dead

You come to get me 
But you'll end up dead

You come to get me
But you'll end up dead

(Overtake you)
You come to get me
But you'll end up dead

Just carry on, just prove me wrong
I know that I'm dying right now
And it seems that I'm so far gone
But not for long
I'll just be strong and keep knowing
That now I will overtake you

You come to get me
You come to get me---Lyrics submitted by Joanna.
