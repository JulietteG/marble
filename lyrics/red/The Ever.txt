I didn't know the things that I could do
I didn't know how much I could lose
Why did I forget so easily
Why couldn't I see I had everything

But you saw more, you saw my deepest part
With the light of a thousand stars
You saw them awaken me
And through your eyes, you showed me everything
You woke me up inside, brought back to life
I lost myself, now I breathe again

Like a poet without pain
Like a beauty without rage
Like an innocence without a life to save
Like a hope without a faith
Like your eyes without a face
Like an instinct with no other life to take
It's beauty and rage
It's beauty and rage
It's beauty and rage
It's beauty and rage---
