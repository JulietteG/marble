Youre a monster in my mind 
Youre the one I cant leave behind 
You crawled inside, I watched you die 
Did you think that you could bury me 

Your love is a lie
I will fight to forget
Your love is a knife
I will die to forget

Did you get what you want from me?
You werent the one that I thought youd be
Everything it cost, everything I lost
Did you think that you could erase me?

Your love is a lie 
I will fight to forget 
Your love is a knife 
I will die to forget

I will fight to forget you 
I will die to forget you

Let me go, let me go
(Love is all a lie)
Let me go, let me go

Youre abandoned
Youre broken down
Your sickness, blame it on me
Your hopelessness
Your insanity
Youre screaming, blame it on me---
