You opened up the scars again
Consume me like a cancer
Bringing on my wicked might distorting all the answers why!

The more I try to walk away
The more you flaunt it in my face
Enticing me with all that I hate

I can't stop the pain
And I'm suffering
I want you erased
I've had enough

Run and escape from the chains that weigh me down
I can't replace this addiction in my head
Run, run, run and escape!
Run. run, I can't escape!

Fear and shame descend on me
Close my mind and let it be
Enslaving me and sealing my fate

I can't stop the pain
And I'm suffering
I want you erased
I've had enough

Run and escape from the chains that weigh me down
I can't replace this addiction in my head
Run, run, run and escape!
Run, run, I can't escape!

Escape, I cannot, I cannot escape! I cannot escape! (Ru-u-u-u-u-u-u-n!)
(Help me!) Run, run and escape!
Escape from all the lies,
From the fire that burns inside and keeps blinding my eyes
I am drawing the line I won't let you take my life, I'm through with all your poison
I need this to die!
I need this to die!
(I want to breath!)

Run, run, run and escape!
Run, run, run,
Help me escape!
Help me escape!
Help me escape!
Help me, help me escape! ---
