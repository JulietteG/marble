You dragged the depths of my soul until you found it
A darkened room locked away, I let you in

You looked inside then you turned away
My makeshift savior, He left me right here in my chains

But still I whisper
(Im calling out)
Still I call you

I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew youd run away
I waited, but you never came
So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
Still I find you
Lost inside the darkest part of me

Its my descent, a familiar pain
Of watching all I believed fade away
Of traitors and fools
Of beggars and thieves
Which mask will you choose
What is underneath
I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew youd run away
I waited, but you never came
So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
Still I find you
Lost inside the darkest part of me

Am I the black stain of your perfect life
Am I the darkness that you need to hide

It covers you
It spills over you

I never wanted you to see
The darkest part of me
I knew youd run away
I waited, but you never came
So afraid to be alone
I tried to let you go
Still I find you
Lost inside the darkest part of me---
