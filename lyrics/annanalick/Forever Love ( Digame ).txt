On the ground
with my world upside-down
I got a vision of your face
And I must get me out 
for so many memories we've yet to make

God don't send to me your angels
I just wanna hear you say again
"Forever, Love" say you'll love
Digame digame
Tell me so I can hold you in my soul
and if I go, I'll know

When you smile with those eyes
Baby, it's like you place a finger on my heart
And your lips next to mine
make me think that maybe heaven's where you are

God don't send to me your angels
I just wanna hear you say again
"Forever, Love" say you'll love
Digame digame
Tell me so I can hold you in my soul
and if I go, I'll know

"Forever, Love" say you'll love
Digame digame
Tell me so I can hold you in my soul
and if I go, I'll know

"Forever, Love" say you'll love
Digame digame
Tell me so I can hold you in my soul
and if I go, I'll know---Lyrics submitted by Rose.
