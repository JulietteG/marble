LA lights never shine quite as bright as in the movies
Still wanna go? 'cause something here in the way, 
In the way that we're constantly moving
Reminds you of home.
So you're taking these pills for to fill up your soul
And your drinking then down with cheap alcohol
And I'd be inclined to be yours for the taking
And part of this terrible mess that your making,
But me, I'm the catalyst
When you say love
is a simple chemical reaction
Can't say I agree,
'cause my chemical, yeah, yeah,
left me a beautiful disaster,
Still love is all is all I see
So I'm taking these pills for to fill up my soul,
And I'm drinking them down with cheap alcohol
And you'd be inclined to be mine for the taking,
And part of this terrible mess that I'm making,
But you, you're the catalyst
And you'll be vain, and you'll be the pain, you'll be the star.
You'll be the road, rolling below,
The wheels of a car, 
And all of your thoughts are gone.
I don't know if I'm strong enough now.
And you'll be vain, and you'll be the pain, you'll be the
Catalyst
These LA lights
They don't shine quite as bright as back in Frisco,
Do you still want to go, still want to go?---Lyrics submitted by Cynthia.
