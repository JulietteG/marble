I could tell you that I loved you from the start
I could tell you that I cut you out of stars
Like you're the flame and I'm a cigarette
Like Clyde and Bonnie, Romeo and Juliet

And we could be a modern Bogart and Bacall
Maybe ours could be the greatest love of all
I could say that I would never criticize you
Never lie when I am looking in your eyes

But that is only words and words and words
Yeah that is only words and words and words
Damn it all the words and words and words just get in my way

And Love, yeah you're leaving me speechless
I can feel it in each kiss
And it's bigger than bigger than words
So I hope you can feel it
Cause I couldn't conceal it
When it's bigger than bigger than words

I could tell you that I want to be a wife
I'd take a vow, take a bullet, take a life
It's beautiful but compared to how I love ya
It's stale and stupid and it's all been said enough

Cause that is only words and words and words
Yeah that is only words and words and words
Damn it all the words and words and words just get in my way

And Love, yeah you're leaving me speechless
I can feel it in each kiss
And it's bigger than bigger than words
So I hope you can feel it
Cause I couldn't conceal it
When it's bigger than bigger than words

And words can't feel
And words don't breathe
And words can't tell you what you mean to me
Those three small words are overused
So "more than words" means more than "I love you"

If you're savvy you'll know what I'm trying to say
When I say "I'll settle for 'I love you' anyway"
I could tell you that I cut you out of stars
But it's just a ghost of what I'm feeling in my heart

And that is only words...
Yeah that is only words...
Damn it all the words and words and words just get in my way

And Love, yeah you're leaving me speechless
I can feel it in each kiss
And it's bigger than bigger than words
So I hope you can feel it
Cause I couldn't conceal it
When it's bigger than bigger than words---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
