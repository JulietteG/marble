He was a soldier
He always was
He left his city to fight for America
And we fell in love to music
We were just kids
We didn't have time to be sorry for what we did

And I said hey, boy
What you crying for?
It'll be okay in the end
And if this life doesn't give you the love you expect
There's always the next

She was a pretty Texas girl
An answer to his prayers
He called me to tell me he'd fallen in love with her
She sang like an angel (aaahhh)
Loved like a friend
She made my soldier believe he could live again

When she said hey, boy
What you crying for?
It'll be okay in the end
And if this life doesn't give you the love you expect
There's always the next

So I'll be a gambler
He'll be home free
And he'll marry Texas and I'll marry melody
So love like my soldier
Fight for what's true
And smile at the gates cuz their hate don't belong to you

Hey, boy
What you crying for?
It'll be okay in the end
And if this life doesn't give you the love you expect
There's always the next

Oh, hey, boy
What you crying for?
It'll be okay in the end
And if this life doesn't give you the love you expect
There's always the next

And if this life doesn't give you the love you expect
There's always the next
There's always the next---Lyrics submitted by colleen.
