he raised his hands
for the last time she could stand
and the room was a grave that night
she left a note said "im not coming home"
took courage but she took flight
What are you really holding onto 
life is a tightrope and your burning burning burning both ends
it dont always move the way it ought to
but dont let the ground drag you around

and these old wings
have been a long time 
been a long time coming
these old wings 
just gotta be good for something
burn these strings so i can see 
what these old broken things 
what these old wings can do

she sold the car for $1100 
and a bottle of something sweet
she caught a train and counted 7 stops
and got off when she felt free

and these old wings
have been a long time 
been a long time coming
these old wings 
just gotta be good for something
burn these strings so i can see 
what these old broken things 
if these old wings can fly

fly 
fly old wings 
high

she found herself where people go and gloom
for friends that are buried there
she wrote a note to god in a balloon
and watched as it disappeared


and these old wings
have been a long time 
been a long time coming
these old wings 
just gotta be good for something
burn these strings so i can see 
what these old broken things 
what these old wings can do---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
