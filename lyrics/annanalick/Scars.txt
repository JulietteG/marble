scars cover you in fine lines
number you a timeline
where was i when you stopped trying?
you borrowing my tears 
and harrowing my mirror
covering our eyes so i cant see us crying

im not going home without you
I'll save your life
not going home without you
I'll make this right
and wait all night
if thats what it takes

i cant believe this skin is one
we've always been with for as long as we recall for
everything that its been through
know that i forgive you
know that i will hold you when the sky is falling

im not going home without you
I'll save your life
not going home without you
I'll make this right
and wait all night
if thats what it takes

and my reflection shows we're clinging for dear life
but i wont let us go
we'll make it through alright  x2

scars cover you in fine lines
number you a timeline
maybe it is time that we live by my guidelines

im not going home without you
I'll save your life
not going home without you
I'll make this right
and wait all night
if thats what it takes

save your life
if thats what it takes
wait all night
if thats what it takes
and wait all night
if thats what it takes---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
