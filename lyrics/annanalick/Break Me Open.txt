I break like a crystal cup
Into a million little pieces but I pick me up
Don't just stare at me, take care of me

Don't let 'em tell ya fucked up isn't fine
There's like a million kinds of crazy and I kind of like mine
I'm not a problem that needs solving

And you can't bleed what's already bled
And if you only knew the shit that rolls around in my head
You'd be a little more fragile when handling me
You see, I heal quickly

Do you break me open just to see if I still bleed?
Do you break me open just to see what's underneath?
Do you find in the way I never mind that you could never
Break me open, just you see, just you see.

You fight like stones and sticks
But I've never known a cut that I couldn't fix
These bruises make sweet music

And you want words but you want me dumb
Now you're playing catch with a loaded gun
You can't tell me how to write this one

No take backs, it's already said
And if you only knew the shit that rolls around in my head
You'd be a little more fragile when handling me
You see, I heal quickly

Do you break me open just to see if I still bleed?
Do you break me open just to see what's underneath?
Do you find in the way I never mind that you could never
Break me open, just you see, just you see.

You can't take what's mine- it's mine
You can't make me silent with violence
You shake your finger at me and expect I'll change

I might break like a crystal cup
Into a million pieces, but I'll pick me up
Don't just stare at me, take care of me

You can't kill what's already dead
And if you only knew the shit that rolls around in my head
You'd be a little more fragile when handling me
You see, I heal quickly

Do you break me open just to see if I still bleed?
Do you break me open just to see what's underneath?
Do you find in the way I never mind that you could never
Break me open, just you see, just you see
Just you see, just you see---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.
