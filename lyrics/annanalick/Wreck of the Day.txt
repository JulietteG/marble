Drivin' away from the wreck of the day,
and the light's always red in the rearview.
Desprately close to a coffin of hope,
I'd cheat destiny just to be near you.

and if this is givin' up well i'm givin' up
if this is givin' up well i'm givin' up, 
givin' up on love, on love.

drivin' away from the wreck of the day,
and i'm thinkin' 'bout calling on Jesus.
This love doesn't hurt,
so i know i'm not fallin' in love
i'm just fallin to peices

and if this is givin' up well i'm givin' up
and if this is givin' up well im givin' up, 
givin' up on love, on love.

[guitar solo]

and maybe i'm not out for being a victom of love
but all my resistance will never be distance enough

woah oh oh oh yeah na na na na buh duh duh duh oh oh

drivin' away from the wreck of the day,
and it's finally quiet in my head
drivin' alone, yeah i'm finally on my way home
 to the comfort of my bed

and if this is givin' up i'm giv'n up
yeah if this is givin' up then i'm givin' up, 
givin' up on love, on love.

oh, yeah yeah  oh oh oh, oooo, woah oh oh oh oh , yeah oh---Lyrics submitted by Isabel.
