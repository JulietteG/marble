2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
Can you help me unravel my latest mistake
I don't love him and winter just wasn't my season.
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason.

Cause you can't jump the track,
We're like cars on a cable and
life's like an hourglass glued to the table.
No one can find the rewind button, girl,
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe. Whoa breathe just breathe

May, he turned 21 on the base of Fort Bliss
Just today he sat down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town you can tell he's been down for while
But my God it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, but maybe I'll just sing about it

'Cause you can't jump the track
We're like cars on a cable and
life's like an hourglass glued to the table,
No one can find the rewind button, boys
So cradle your head in your hands.
And breathe, just breathe,  ohhh breathe just breathe

There's a light at each end of this tunnel
you shout cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made
You'll just make them again if you'll only try turnin' around

 2 AM and I'm still awake writing this song
If I get it all down on paper it's no longer inside of me
Threatnin' the life it belongs to.
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screamin' out loud
And I know that you'll use them however you want to.

Cause you can't jump the track
We're like cars on a cable and
life's like an hourglass glued to the table,
No one can find the rewind button now
 Sing it if you understand...
Yeah breathe, just breathe, ohhh breathe,  just breathe
Yeah breathe, just breathe, ohhh breathe,  just breathe---Lyrics submitted by Dennis.
