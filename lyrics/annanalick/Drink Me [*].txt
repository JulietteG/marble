Talk about the weather
Will you miss me ever?
Lately I'm obsessed
And I need the rest
I hope that you're impressed
She's so pretty, I'm jealous
And she's lost like Alice
In a painted past
In a looking glass
I see me looking back

I'll take another Drink Me, baby
Slowly, I'll disappear
And wear my life like a barbed wire necklace
So let's play it truth or dare

So you're a fan of Coltrane
I wanna be Curt Cobain
When the truth gets scary
I'll take my gin and sherry
And some Drink Me they'll be
Plath and Joplin with verse writing suiciders
Kennedy and Monroe come to see my rock show
I'll be there in the front row

I'll take another Drink Me, baby
Slowly, I'll disappear
And wear my life like a barbed wire necklace
So let's play truth or dare

And I won't be around to play your games
There will come a day when you won't know my name
And I'll get smaller with
Every swallow you'll
Wait tomorrow and things won't be the same

Talk about the weather
Will you miss me ever?
Lately I'm obsessed
And I need the rest
I hope that you're impressed
Cuz I need the rest
Yeah my head's a mess
I need the rest
I need the rest
I need the rest---Lyrics submitted by colleen.
