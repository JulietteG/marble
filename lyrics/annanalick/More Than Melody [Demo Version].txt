Hey Mr. Love Ive been singing and still
Theres a hole in my heart only a man can fill 
But hes had a blistered love and were sharing a bed 
But hes not in a state to be readily left in my hands
In my hands, in my hands, in my hands

Hey love live it up
Cuz Im getting closer
And I want love, give it up
This poetry and prose and words are not enough
Cuz youre more than melody to meI think

So morning come and Im nervously clad
In these sheets not my own and these hands where they dont belong
And Im all but a victim in my prison head
I should run for my gun but Im lying instead in your hands
In your hands, in your hands, in your hands

And you say hey love, live it up
Cuz Im getting closer
And I want love, give it up
This poetry and prose and words are not enough
Cuz youre more than melody to meI think

And holding out our hands before us
All the world will love and whore us
My heart, oh lord, is in your hands

In your hands, in my hands
In your hands, in my hands
In my hands, in my hands
In my hands, in my hands, in my

Oh-ooohhhhhh, yeah

Hey Mr. Love, Im too tired to sing but he.is more than melody to me---Lyrics submitted by Lindsay.
