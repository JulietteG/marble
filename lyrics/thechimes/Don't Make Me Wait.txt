Cant you see Im holding out my hands
Dreaming of the things that youll do .. and 
Cant you feel I need you by my side
Only you can pull me through (so)

[CHORUS]
Dont make me wait
Its been a long time coming 
But I think weve found the love
Dont make me wait
Its been a lifetime coming
But Im sure weve found the love

Cant you tell Im holding back my tears
Without your touch I just cant be  Oh
Cant you feel I need you always here
Only you can satisfy my desire

[CHORUS]
Dont make me wait
Its been a long time coming 
But I think weve found the love
Dont make me wait
Its been a lifetime coming
But Im sure weve found the love

I would never hope to understand 
All the different ways that you feel inside
III could never try to make demands
Because you know I love you, babe

[CHORUS]
Dont make me wait
Its been a long time coming 
But I think weve found the love
Dont make me wait
Its been a lifetime coming
But Im sure weve found the love---Lyrics submitted by Sophia Valentin.
