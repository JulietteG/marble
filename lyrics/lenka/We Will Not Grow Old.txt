You and me Will be lying Side by side
Forever, forever
Underneath this adolescent sky
Together, together

And you Will hold my heart
Inside your hand
And you'll be the one
The one to tell me

Oh, we've got a long, long way to go
To get there, We'll get there
But oh, If there's one thing that we know
It's that We will not grow old

I made you swear that our hearts will never die
No never, no never
Cause no one seems to believe that we can fly
Forget them, forget them, Oh, you told me

Oh, We've got a long, long way to go
To get there, yeah we'll get there
But oh, If there's one thing that we know
It's that we will not grow old

Oh, We've got a long, long way to go
To get there, we'll get there
But oh, If there's one thing that we know
It's that we will not grow old

Oh, how could We know that day
It came with age
That oh, the feeling would fade

Oh, We've got a long, long way to go
To get there, we'll get there
But oh, If there's one thing that we know
It's that we will not grow old

Oh, We've got a long, long way to go
To get there, yeah we'll get there
But oh, If there's one thing that we know
It's that we will not grow old

We will not grow old
We won't grow old
No,no, We will not grow old
Oh no, We will not grow old
We will not grow old---Lyrics submitted by fat.
