I'm just a lil bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and
Love is a riddle

I don't know where to go
Can't do it Alone, I'v tried
And i don't know why

Slow it down, make it stop
 or else my heart is going to pop!
Cuz it's too much, yeah it's a lot
To be somethin i'm not!

I'm a fool out of love
cuz i can't just get enough

I'm just a lil bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and
Love is a riddle

I don't know where to go
Can't do it Alone, I'v tried
And i don't know why

I'm just a lil girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but i don't show it
I can't figure it out, it's bringin me down
I know

I'v got to let it go

And just enjoy the show

The sun is hot, in the sky
Just like a giant spot light
The people follow the signs 
And synchronize in time

It's a joke nobody knows
They got a ticket to that show

I'm just a lil bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and
Love is a riddle

I don't know where to go
Can't do it Alone, I'v tried
And i don't know why

I'm just a lil girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but i don't show it
I can't figure it out, it's bringin me down
I know

I'v got to let it go

And just enjoy the show -oh oh

just enjoy the show- oh oh oh

I'm just a lil bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze and
Love is a riddle

I don't know where to go
Can't do it Alone, I'v tried
And i don't know why

I'm just a lil girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared but i don't show it
I can't figure it out, it's bringin me down
I know

I'v got to let it go

and just enjoy the show

Dum- de- dum
da- dum- de- dum

Just enjoy the show

Dum- de- dum
da- dum- de- dum

Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back

Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back

Just enjoy the show---Lyrics submitted by Lydia R Black.
