I will never be, I will never be tall, no
I will never be, Never ever be sure of it all
Oh, why's the world so cruel to me
When all, all i ever want to be is anything i'm not
Gimme a break, A little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not, I'm not
I will never be, I wil never be you
No, I will always be, I will always be me
That i know, but oh
Even though I'm happy being me
I want to get away from all this harsh reality
Gimme a break, a little escape
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything i'm not
Yeah gimme a break a little escape, I'm so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different 
Anything I'm not, Anything I'm not, oooh, anything I'm not
Gimme a break, a little escape 
I am so tired of being me
I wanna be free, I wanna be new and different
Anything I'm not
Gimme a break, A little escape I am so tired of being me
I want to be free I want to be new and different
Anything I'm not, Anything I'm not, Anything I'm not, Anything I'm not, Anything I'm not---Lyrics submitted by RosieRage.
