Its difficult to see from the surface
But everything goes in and it stings
Like a spider hits you deep inside

And I know that you are just like me
Oversensitive, where an ordinary breed
Taking everything for much more than it means
Well its dangerous, and its sweet
Cut us and we bleed.

All these words we speak, casually
Well maybe i'm just weak, but it hurts me
Everything you said, everything you said, everything you said
Well it cuts, like a knife it hurts me deep inside

And I know that you are just like me
Oversensitive, where an ordinary breed
Taking everything for much more than it means
Well its dangerous, and its sweet
Cut us and we bleed.

I should put on my armour the next time i see you so i wont be harmed
But I know I could shoot my own arrows I'm sorry I hurt you
I know that like me, you can be oversensitive.

Bah-bah-bah-da-bah-da-bah-da-da, bah-da-da-da-da
bah-bah-bah-da-da-da-da-da, bah-da-bah-bah bah

And I know that you are just like me
Oversensitive, where an ordinary breed
Taking everything for much more than it means
Well its dangerous, and its sweet
yeah its dangerous, and sweet
Dont you know its dangerous and its sweet
Cut us and we bleed---Lyrics submitted by Djei.
