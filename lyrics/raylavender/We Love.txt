I know, I know
Its been a bit much to mend
when Im here and youre there
Emotions everywhere
Tip-toeing on the shattered pieces of your heart
Until I can find the way to put it back together

[Chorus:]
And we gotta find a reason for love
Cause thats what we do, thats what we do
And I gotta find a way to your trust
Baby lock and key is just you and me
Girl, weve searched time and time again
And what we found through it all
We all fighting for the same cause
Cause we love yeah!
We love from a different place, and a different way oh
But love, in any case its all the same
And I really know is I need you
And I never wanna do this without you
Cause we love, and thats reason to love, yeah
Cause we love!

Girl, I know how it goes
Space between us makes this harder than ever before
But these moments are to treasure
So whenever we are close,

we cant expect to make the most
Of what it is we share, lets take it there, without a care

[Chorus:]
And we gotta find a reason for love
Cause thats what we do, thats what we do
And I gotta find a way to your trust
Baby lock and key is just you and me
Girl, weve searched time and time again
And what we found through it all
We all fighting for the same cause
Cause we love yeah!
We love from a different place, and a different way oh
But love, in any case its all the same
And I really know is I need you
And I never wanna do this without you
Cause we love, and thats reason to love, yeah
Cause we love!

You love me this way, and I love you that way
Its alright!
Just as long as were loving each other
Without you Id be so inferior!
Besides, I need you in my life
Cause we love baby, we love baby

[Chorus:]
We love from a different place, and a different way oh
But love, in any case its all the same
And I really know is I need you
And I never wanna do this without you
Cause we love, and thats reason to love, yeah
Cause we love!---Lyrics submitted by iveasia ford.
