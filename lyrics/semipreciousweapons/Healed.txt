If it was a citrine stone
Or a prayer that you were told,
I don't really need to know.
I just hope that you were healed.
I just hope that you were healed.

If it was a mystic's word
Or some sage that you have earned,
I don't need to be so sure.
I just hope that you were healed.
I just hope that you were healed.

Even though I barely know
A stranger on the street from you,
The feeling still somehow grows.
I will still tell you jokes
For a couple years or so.
So every time you feel that glow,
Just know it's me.

I just hope that you were healed.
I just hope that you were healed.

If it wasn't smoke you smoked
Or a graveness grown,
I don't really need to know.
I just hope that you were healed.
I just hope that you were healed.

Our floating days are clearly done.
And no matter where they've gone,
I'm just glad that I had one.
I just hope that you were healed.
I just hope that you were healed.

This kinda ended perfectly
Cause now you're gonna always be
A beautiful mystery,
The one that got away from me,
But I'll think of it happily.
So every time you have that dream,
Just know it's me.

I just hope that you were healed.
I just hope that you were healed.---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
