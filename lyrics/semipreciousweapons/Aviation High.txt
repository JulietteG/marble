I like the way you look in my town
I like the way you look at my street
I like the way you look in my house
I like the way you look in my sheets

I like the way you taste with a drink
I like the way you taste with a smile
I like the way you taste when I sing
I like it when its been a while
I like it when its been a while

Our night is lit by the city moon
And I see myself reflect on you
I know what I was meant to do

We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're aviation high
We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're aviation high
Aviation, aviation, aviation, we're aviation high

I find myself countin' the days
I find myself countin' your lashes
I think I memorized your face
But then again who hasn't

Moments when you say what you should
Moments when you say something better
It feels so good I wish you would
Keep on saying never forever
Keep on saying never forever

Our night is lit by the city moon
And I see myself reflect on you
I know what I was meant to do

We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're aviation high
We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're aviation high
Aviation, aviation, aviation, we're aviation high (high)

Don't wake me up when you're leavin'
'Cause I wanna keep on dreamin' of this

We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're aviation high
We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're alive, alive
We're aviation high
Aviation, aviation, aviation, we're aviation high
Aviation, aviation, aviation, we're aviation high---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
