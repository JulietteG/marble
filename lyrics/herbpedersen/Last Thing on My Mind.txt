Last Thing on My Mind   written by Tom Paxton

It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul was turning
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well, I could have loved you better 
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

Underneath our feet the subways a-rumblin'
Under ground, under ground
And the wheels on the highway are turning
Round and 'round, 'round and 'round

Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well, I could have loved you better 
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

You got reasons a plenty for going
This I know, this I know
And for weeks they've been steadily growing
Please don't go, please don't go

Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well, I could have loved you better 
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind---Lyrics submitted by Bill Strejc.
