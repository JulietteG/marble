(One) Day when i was chillin' in Kentucky Fried Chicken
Just mindin' my own business, eatin' food and finger lickin' 
This dude walked in lookin' strange and kinda funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didn't walk straight kinda side to side
He asked this old lady, "Yo Yo, um is this Kentucky Fried?"
The lady said yes, smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order, small fries, Big Mac !
You be Illin', (Illin') X4

(To) Day you one a ticket to see Doctor Jay
Front Row Seat (In Free !) no Pay
Radio in hand, snacks by feet
Games about to start, kickin' popcorn to the beat
Finally wake up, Docs gone to town
Round his back, through the hoop, then you scream "Touch Down!"
You be Illin', (Illin') X4

The other day, around the way, i see you illin' at a party
Drunk as skunk, you illin' punk, and in your left hand was Bacardi
You went up to this fly girl and said " yo, yo can i get this dance?"
She smelt your breath, and then she left you standin' in your illin' stance
You be Illin', (Illin') X4

(For) Dinner you ate it,  there is none left
It was salty, with butter and it was def
You proceeded to eat it, cause you was in the mood
but Holmes you did not read it was a can of dog food !
You Be Illin' (Illin') X12---Lyrics submitted by Brooke.
