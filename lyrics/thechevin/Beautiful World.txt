Look at the world as it's turning
Look at the light as it shines down on me
Every star suffered burning
Every atom of light from the sea

It's such a beautiful world
Can't we all of us want it in peace
It's such a beautiful world
And if you want it, you just have to believe
Open your eyes and you'll see

Look at the wall as it's turning
Infinite life lived in infinite speeds
Every smell, every sound of the color
All that is you makes up all that is me

It's such a beautiful world
Can't we all of us want it in peace
It's such a beautiful world
And if you want it, you just have to believe
Open your eyes and you'll see
Open your eyes and you'll see

It's such a beautiful world
Can't we all of us want it in peace
It's such a beautiful world
And if you want it, you just have to believe
It's such a beautiful world
It's such a beautiful world
It's such a beautiful world
And if you want it, you just have to believe
Open your eyes and you'll see

Look at the world as it's turning
Look at the light as it shines down on me---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Galo.
