Who is the fly in your champagne?
Who's got the body and who's got the brain?
I'll take your blood and kill my pain,
you are the one that I desire,
you are the dark, I'm the vampire.

Who is the spy in your campaign?
Is it the wife or is it your advisor?
I wanna suck the blood from their veins.
You are the one that I despise
you are the light, I'm the vampire.

Oh, you know you never found an easy way,
Oh, but you know but you know you wanna ride the new wave, yeah.

Who is the fly in your champagne?
who's got the body and who's got the brain?
Let me take your blood 'cause I'm in pain
You are the one that I desire,
You are the dark, I'm the vampire.

Women and children hold this flame,
You're none the wiser,
You're not to blame.
Stick 'em in a casket next to mine,
then we we will see who is alive.
Then we will see who is the vampire.

Oh, you know you'd never find an easy way
'Cause in your head,
The devil said,
"Now it's over"
They'd send in the kill,
that's got me until,
when it's over,
when it's over, yeah.

Who is the fly in your champagne?
Who's got the body and who's got the brain?
Take your blood and I'll kill my pain,
you are the dark, and I'm the vamipre!---Lyrics submitted by $tewart.
