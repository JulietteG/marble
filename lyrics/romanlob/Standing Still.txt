Guess we knew this was coming on
Cause youre already gone in my head
You can tell me that Im wrong
That youre staying with me instead

The wind has come along and summers dead and gone
Is there anything left here to say?
I can put my arms around the emptiness I found
Find a way to make you stay

But Im standing still, Im standing still
As you leave me now
Im standing still, Im standing still
As youre walking out
Im just standing still

Never thought Id be so strong
But pieces of me break so easy
What I thought would be the end
Is just the feeling that you freed me

Girl this aint giving up, its knowing where to stop
Knowing every thing is over
I know my love is blind, I see for the first time
Things aint gonna bring us closer

But Im standing still, Im standing still
As you leave me now, yeah
Im standing still, Im standing still
As youre walking out

Im standing still
Im just standing still as you leave me now
Im just standing still

The wind has come along, time is dead and gone
Is there anything left here to say?
I can put my arms around the emptiness I found
Find a way to make you stay

Im standing still, Im standing still
As you leave me now, yeah
Im standing still, Im standing still
As youre walking out
Im just standing still---
