Our father in heaven
Hallowed by thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

On earth as it is in heaven
And forgive us for all of our sins
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from all that's evil

[CHORUS]
I give you all love
I give you all hope
Or so it seems 'cause the
masses wanna buy a dream
~~
God is a popstar!
And the show starts now
God is a popstar!
Hear the screaming crowd
God is a popstar!
Master of it all
God is a popstar!
'Till the curtain falls

Our father in heaven
Hallow be thy game
My flesh for someone
My will be done

So just give us heaven on earth now
And forgive us for all our desires
Now lead us into temptation
And deliver us from all that's evil

[CHORUS]
I give you all love
I give you all hope
Or so it seems 'cause the
masses wanna buy a dream
~~
God is a popstar!
And the show starts now
God is a popstar!
Hear the screaming crowd
God is a popstar!
Master of it all
God is a popstar!
'Till the curtain falls

We're all so happy
We're all in love with the show
The world is holy
Together we're all alone

We're all so happy
So get in line here with me
The world is holy
The lie will set you all free

God is a popstar!
And the show starts now
God is a popstar!
Hear the screaming crowd
God is a popstar!
Master of it all
God is a popstar!
