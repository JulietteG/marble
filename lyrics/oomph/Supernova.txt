You're like a seraphim,
You're good to the bone
The slightest mending could not finely hone
You would not make it if you were on your own,
And this is why I'll never leave you alone

You can't start from
Where I end
You can't start from
Where I end

You walked into my trap
And I let it spring
(follow me home)
Because someone should take you under his wing
(follow me home)
You felt the cleansing of my pain-killing sting
(follow me home)
Now if you need some more just give me a ring

You can't start from
Where I end
You can't start from
Where I end

Unite and take over - create a supernova
Unite and take over - create a supernova
Give it to me - Give it to me - Give it to me
(Give in to me)

You can start from
Where I am
You can start from
Where I am

Unite and take over - create a supernova
Unite and take over - create a supernova

Unite and take over - now Ive got you deep inside
me
Unite and take over - now Ive got you deep inside
my soul---Lyrics submitted by David.
