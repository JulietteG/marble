It feels like the fairytale is over, I really wanted these pages to begin
With "Once upon a time" like all those lullabies
I should've known better, I'll admit it, I thought when I let you in
You were my shining knight from all those stories

This love is your illusion, this love is your illusion
Take me to a place with real-life love
I need a break from this broken-down fantasy
Show me a place I can realize love, not your illusion

It feels like the fairytale is over, I really wanted these pages to begin

This love is your illusion, this love is your illusion
Take me to a place with real-life love
I need a break from this broken-down fantasy
Show me a place I can realize love, not your illusion---
