Breathing you in when i want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quite drama, a-a-ah
Wearing your heart like a stolen dream
Opening skies with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer.
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go.
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go.

Breathing you in when i want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quite drama, a-a-ah.

Breathing you in when i want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quite drama, a-a-ah
Wearing your heart like a stolen dream
Opening skies with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer.

We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go.

We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go.
We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go.

Breathing you in when i want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quite drama, a-a-ah---Lyrics submitted by skyelar knight.
