I was a boat drifting out into sea
I had nothing but pieces of thoughts
Of the hope that you would see me
And I was a stone thrown away from land
But thousands and thousands of miles
Away from reaching your hand

The waves that crashed upon
The rocks that you were
Trying to walk along
And in my head I
Heard them play your song
For you and me
The waves that crashed upon
The rocks that you were
Trying to step along
And in my head I
Heard them play your song
For you and me

Let's get lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Marv.
