We are, we are a violent chemistry
Love has taken us as far as we can reach
But I cant leave
We are, we are imagine ecstasy
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
A memory

We are, we are in love, enemies
We are sentimental slaves on broken knees
Were on empty
We were, we were one identity
Now the trouble is remembering
Addicted to a memory---
