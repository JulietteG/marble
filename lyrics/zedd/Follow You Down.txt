Fading so slow, black hole, 
I feel it slipping away. 
We're all we've got, if your lost, 
I'm diving in after you. 
I would touch the sun, I'd come undone, 
it's true I'd fall for you.

Wherever you go, whatever you do, 
you know I'll follow you down. 
Wherever you go, if ever you lose your ground, 
I'd follow you down.

I follow you down...
I follow you you you...
Down...down...down...
down...down...down..down....

Wherever you go, whatever you do, 
you know I'll follow you down. 
Wherever you go, if ever you lose your ground, 
I'd follow you down.

l follow you down...
I follow you you...

Your lost, worn out, face down, 
don't know where your headed to. 
Right here, right now, some how I, 
I'm like the way up for you, 
I would touch the sun, I'd come undone, 
it's true I'd fall for you.

Wherever u go, whatever you do, 
you know I'll follow you down. 
Wherever you go, if ever you lose your ground, 
I'd follow you down.

I follow you down...
I follow you you you...
Down...down...down...
down...down...down...down...

Wherever you go.....
Whatever you do.....
Wherever you go.....
Whatever you do.....
Wherever you go, whatever you do, 
you know I'll follow you down. 
Wherever you go, if ever you lose your ground,
I'd follow you down.---Lyrics submitted by jasmin rouse.
