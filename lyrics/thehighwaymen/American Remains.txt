(Johnny)
I am a shotgun rider, for the Saniel-Sinto Line 
the desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dried
I was ridin' on a full coach, and everything was fine
till we took a shorter road to save some time, 
the bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest,
they may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best
of better men, cause I'll ride again

(Waylon)
I am a river gambler, I make a livin' dealin' cards
my clothes are smooth and honest, my heart is cold and hard
I was shufflin' for some delta boys on a boat for New Orleans
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
but the captain bumped a sandbar, and an ace fell out my sleeve
they threw me overboard as I swore I didn't cheat
but I could swim, and I'll ride again

(Chorus)
We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many places, and answer many names
we will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
our memories will all be part of time,
at poets pen, we'll ride again

(Willie) 
I am a Midwest farmer, I make a livin' off the land,
I drive a John Deere tractor, I'm a liberated man
but the rain it hasn't fallen, since the middle of July,
and if it don't come soon my crops will die,
the bank man says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do,
he tells me that he's comin' but the clouds are comin' too
he ain't my friend, and I'll ride again

(Kris)
I am an American Indian, my tribe is Cherokee, 
my poor fathers loved this land, they left it here for me,
the white man came with boats and trains and dirty factories,
poisoned my existence with his fees
Nature is our mother, we are sucklings at her breasts
he who tries to beat her down will loose her to the rest,
they'll never win, I'll ride again

(Chorus)
We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many places, and answer many names
we will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
our memories will all be part of time,
at poets pen, we'll ride again---Lyrics submitted by Keagen Gundersn.
