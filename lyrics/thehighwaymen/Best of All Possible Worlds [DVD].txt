I was drivin' thru the summer rain 
tryin' to catch the evenin' train,
And kill that old familiar pain 
a-weavin' thru my tangled brain;
And when I tipped my bottle back I smacked into a cop I didn't see.

That police man said "Mr. cool,
if you ain't drunk then your a fool."
I said "If that's against the law 
then tell me why I never saw
A man locked in that jail of yours that wasn't just as low down poor as me?"

Well, that was when someone turned out the lights,
And I wound up in jail to spend the night;
Dreamin' 'bout some wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds.

When I woke up the next mornin'
feelin' like my head was gone
And like my thick old tongue
was a-lickin' somethin' sick and wrong.
I told that man I'd sell my soul for somethin' wet 'n' cold as that old cell.

That kindly jailer grinned at me 
all eaten up with sympathy,
And poured himself another beer,
and came and whispered in my ear,
"If booze was just a dime a bottle, boy, you couldn't even buy the smell."

Well, I knew there was somethin' I liked about this town,
But it takes more than that to bring me down, down, down, down.
'Cuz there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds.

They finally came and told me 
they was gonna set me free,
And I'd be leavin' town 
if I knew what was good for me.
I said "It's nice to know that everybody's so concerned about my health."

I said " I won't be leavin'
no more quicker than I can,
'Cuz I've enjoyed about 
as much of this as I can stand;
And I don't need this town of yours no more'n I never needed nothin' else."

"Cuz there's still a lot of drinks I ain't drunk,
Lots o' pretty thoughts I ain't thunk.
And there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls
In this best of all possible worlds."---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
