It seems like yesterday, but it was a long time ago
She was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low.
The secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved
Caught like a wild fire out of control     
Till there was nothing left to burn 
and nothing left to prove.
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it would never end
I remember how she held me oh, so tight,
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then.

Chorus:
Against the wind,
We were running against the wind.
We were young and strong,
We were running against the wind.

The years rolled slowly past, I found myself alone,
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends,
I found myself further and further from my home.
And I guess I lost my way, there were oh, so many roads.
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live,
Never worrying about paying or how much I owed.
Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time,
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend.
I began to find myself
Searching for shelter again and again.

Chorus:
Against the wind,
We were running against the wind.
I found myself seeking
Shelter against the wind.

All those drifter's days are passed me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments,
What to leave in and what to leave out.

Chorus:
Against the wind,
We were running against the wind.
Well I'm older now and still 
Running against the wind
Against the wind---
