(Waylon)
 The wind blows hard across the Texas plains
 Makes some people go insane
 While others quietly pray for rain
 That's where we came from
 Two boys playin' in the burnin' sun
 One with books, one with guns
 Mama calls, but just one comes
 (Willie)
 The other one runs

(All)
 In the crystal sense of wrong and right
 We were born and raised in black and white
 One learned to pray, one learned to fight
 We were born and raised in the black and white
 We were born and raised in black and white

(Kris)
 Brother took to the gospel road
 Spent his whole life savin' souls
 (Waylon)
 When he looked at me, his blood ran cold
 He didn't even try
 I had no dreams, I had no plans
 But a gun felt good in my right hand
 The warden asked, "How come you killed that man"
 I said, "I don't know why"

(All)
 "Welcome home," said the hot moonlight
 We were born and raised in black and white
 One lives to pray, one prays for life
 We were born and raised in black and white
 We were born and raised in black and white

(Waylon)
 Someone handed me a cigarette
 They offered me my last request
 I asked my mortal soul be blessed
 By someone close to me
 He came to me with trembling hands
 He swore he'd never understand
 I said, "It's just what life had planned
 "It's destiny

(All)
 "Don't waste your tears on me tonight
 "We were born and raised in black and white
 "I chose the dark, you chased the light
 "We were born and raised in black and white"
 We were born and raised in black and white

(Willie)
 Wind blows hard across the Texas plains
 Makes some people go insane
 (Kris)
 While others quietly pray for rain---Lyrics submitted by Abraham Moore.
