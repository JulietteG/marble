Trouble would strike and the miners did the same
They balled up their fists and let their fingers point the blame
Some would work the docks down on by the River Thames
Where they spent all their money on various things

Where did all of the workmen go?
Sure ain't down in Ludlow, baby
Whoa, whoa whoa-whoa

Mr. Trinidad he gave the union all the goods
The union used those goods up just like you knew they would
Start up your militia and you take just what you want
Boy you sneak in through the back door and you shoot them in the front

Where did all of the workmen go?
Sure ain't down in Ludlow, baby
Whoa, whoa whoa-ho whoa

Bring it down the mountain, Zarathustra 
Keep your thoughts to yourself
The folks 'round here won't get used to
All those ideas on your shelf

Where did all of the workmen go?
Sure ain't down in Ludlow, baby
I said, where did all of the workmen go?
Sure ain't down in Ludlow, baby
Where did all of the workmen go?
Oh, they sure ain't down in Ludlow, baby
Where did all of the workmen go?
Sure ain't down in Ludlow, baby
