The red sandstone it fell
Right smack on top, of Sedona Arabelle
When John Ford said don't you hop on in the stage coach baby gonna take you for a spin, oh woah
Oh woah

Well hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but you're credit no good
You flip the script and you shot the plot
I remember I remember when the neon use to burn, so bright and pink
Saturday night kind of pink!

Well the blacklist and its host
He came down so swift
And he drove him to the coast

Were going to California but we're all out of work
I guess that's better than a great little hurt, oh woah
Oh woah

Well hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but you're credit no good
You flip the script and you shot the plot
I remember I remember when the neon use to burn, so bright and pink
Saturday night kind of pink!

Now the devils in their rust
And this duct tape makes you hush
Well hey there Sedona let me cut you a deal I'm a little hungover and I may have to steal your soul
Oh woah

Well hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but you're credit no good
You flip the script and you shot the plot
I remember I remember when the neon use to burn, so bright and pink
So bright and pink!
Saturday night kind of pink!---
