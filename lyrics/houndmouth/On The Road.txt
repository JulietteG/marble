I'm on the road, I'm on the road
I'm on the road and I'm sinking slowly
I bought a book, I bought a book
I bought a book, gonna read it slowly

I'm going down where nobody knows me
I'm going down where nobody knows me
I'm going down, ain't nobody gonna know me

I had a job, I had a job
I had a job had to leave behind me
I had to move, I had to move
I had to move to another city

I'm going down where nobody knows
I'm going down where nobody knows me
I'm going down, ain't nobody gonna know me

Hey there sugar mama you know what you want but I don't got it 
I wish I could help you out but I cannot

Hey there boy blue I think there's something wrong with you
I wish that I could help you out but I cannot

I'm going down where nobody knows
I'm going down where nobody knows
I'm going down, ain't nobody gonna know me---Lyrics submitted by Marieli.
