Oh my Palmyra
Sweeter than sugarcane
She took a Kentucky shower
In the pouring Tennessee rain
Long live Cherokee bloodline
Keeps her skin olive and tan
Oh my Palmyra

Oh my God
Tastes just like medicine
She's got a room with a balcony
At the Holiday Inn
She'll have you on up for the weekend
Fix you a Robert Roy
Oh my Palmyra

Oh my Palmyra
Palmyra
Palmyra
Palmyra
Palmyra
Palmyra
Palmyra
Oh my Palmyra

Spelled out and perfectly tattooed 
Was my name on the back of her hand

Oh my Palmyra
Palmyra
Palmyra
Palmyra
Palmyra---Lyrics submitted by Marieli.
