Come on, Illinois
There's a fire in the city
We're making noise
You're burning bright and pretty
It's a long way just to make it to the borderline

Put your vote in a box
A political action committee
Take what you know 
Throw it down the goddamn privy
It's a long way just to make it to the borderline

Vivian, you've been a bad girl
You took your mother's lantern and you dropped it in the farmhouse
And you burnt down the city
Oh you pretty young girl
Well you never had a chance

Built your house on a drawbridge
You thought it would protect you but the flames they travel fast here
And they're coming out to get you
Oh you pretty young girl
Well you never had a chance

And it's a long way just to make it to the borderline
And it's a long way just to make it to the borderline---Lyrics submitted by Marieli.
