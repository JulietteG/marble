Selena talk part:
Sometimes at night when I go to sleep I 
Hold my pillow tight thinking of 
You till it hurts. But in my mind I 
Know you're mine and somewhere you're 
Thinking of me too.

Full Force:
I miss you, thinking of you. You're always on my mind.

Selena 1st verse:
You're always on my mind,(day and night)day and night
When i think of you boy, everything feels so right
Well, i often think of the happy times we spent
Together and I just can't wait to tell you that I love you 

Selena 2nd verse:
Time keeps passing by (You're not here) you're not here 
I feel so all alone
When I don't have you near. But I often think of the happy times we spent together, and i just can't wait to tell you that I love you.

Selena and Full Force Chorus:
I'm Missing my baby, Missing my baby
I wanna hold you tight and never let you out of my sight.
Missing my baby, missing my baby
I gotta feel your heart beat (your heart beat) Next to mine
Gotta feel it (feel it)

Repeat 2nd verse
Repeat Chorus

Full Force:
Thinking of you is all I do its the next best thing 
to being with you and baby, hey

Selena and Full Force:
Gotta have you (have you) gotta hold you (hold you)
Got to have your lovin' (I gotta have you)

Selena:
And tell you that I love you 
And I really miss you 
(I miss You)

Repeat chorus
I miss you, thinking of you
You're always on my min---Lyrics submitted by Eudelia.
