Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I wish on a star
That somewhere you are thinking of me too

'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me

Wonder if you ever see me
And I wonder if you know I'm there
If you looked in my eyes
Would you see what's inside? Would you even care?

I just wanna hold you close
But so far all I have are dreams of you
So I wait for the day and the courage to say
How much I love you, yes, I do

I'll be dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me

Corazon
(I can't stop dreaming of you)
No puedo dejar de pensar en ti
(I can't stop dreaming of you)
Como te necesito
(I can't stop dreaming of you)
Mi amor, como te exstra

Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I still can't believe that you came up to me
And said, "I love you," I love you too

Now I'm dreaming with you tonight
'Til tomorrow and for all of my life
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly

Dreaming with you tonight
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly
(I'll be dreamin')

Dreaming of you tonight
(Endlessly)
And I'll be holding you tight
('Till tomorrow)
Dreaming with you tonight!
(Endlessly)
(Endlessly)
(Endlessly)
