I feel as stupid like some bubblegum
I feel as lonely as a cookie crumb
Half-wasted and all alone, that's fine

You ain't leavin' for another day
[Uhhhh]
We'll pogo party in a major way
Have fun

B4 I go-o-o
Totally loco-o-o
We can fall down and boogie like I'm five years old

CHORUS:
Let's pogo b4 u gogo
I can't believe you're leaving me behind
Let's pogo b4 u gogo one last time (x2)

I ain't really good at anything
But I can boogie like you've never seen
Cuttin' rugs just like a jumping bean tonight

I hope you know I'm gonna miss ya
I'll buy you dinner at the sizzler
And get you twisted as a twister tonight

B4 u go-o-o
Let's get loco-o-o
We can dress up like monsters like I'm five years old

[CHORUS x4]

One more time!!

[instrumental]

B4 I go-o-o
Totally loco-o-o
We can fall down and boogie like I'm five years old
Let's pogo, let's pogo, let's pogo
One last time [x4]---Lyrics submitted by godmom.
