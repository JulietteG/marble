Friend I let myself in
 Little bold 
 saturated sigh
 I hoped you might
 Help my sorrow's din
 Bring out your breath of strife

My friend
 Can you help me
 Why did I drink
 From that devil's hand
 Oh my friend
 Can you help me
 Why did I drink
 From his hand

It's not easy
 It's not kind
 These things we turn to face
 It's not easy
 It's not kind
 These things we turn to face

Oh my friend
 Can you help me
 Why did I drink
 From the devil's hand
 Oh my friend
 Can you help me
 Why did I drink
 From his hand

Come take my hand
 We'll say goodbye

 Come take my hand
 We'll ride from here---
