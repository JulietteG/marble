Don't you walk away
I've given too much of me
Can't you understand?
I know that it's hard to see
Time is on our hands
And I don't wanna waste no more
I can't afford to lose you

But we can, we can, we can, we can work it out
Even if we try and it all burns down
We can, we can, we can, we can work it out
Even if we try and it all burns down
We can, we can, we can, we can work it out
Even if we try and it all burns down
We can, we can, we can, we can work it out
Even if we try and it all burns down

We can, we can, we can work it out
We can, we can, we can work it out
We can, we can, we can work it out
We can, we can, we can work it out

But we can, we can, we can, we can work it out
Even if we try and it all burns down
We can, we can, we can, we can work it out
Even if we try and it all burns down
But we can, we can, we can, we can work it out
Even if we try and it all burns down
We can, we can, we can, we can work it out
Even if we try and it all burns down

We can, we can, we can work it out
We can, we can, we can work it out
We can, we can, we can work it out
We can, we can, we can work it out---
