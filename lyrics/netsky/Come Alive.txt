Too good to be true our worlds collide
Now I understand why
Its been so long on the other side
Feel my heart was gonna die

So look straight into my eyes
Tell me the truth and not lies
Put your hands up and testify
And my heart will come alive

And my heart will come alive

And my heart will come alive

And my heart will come alive

And my heart will come alive

Too good to be true our worlds collide
Now I understand why
Its been so long on the other side
Feel my heart was gonna die

So look straight into my eyes
Tell me the truth and not lies
Put your hands up and testify
And my heart will come alive

And my heart will come alive

And my heart will come alive---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
