Why won't you hold me?
Why would you care?
Falling back into the memories
But we can only live today
In one direction
Colours change in the light of day
Our lives are on the highway
And we can only live today.
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today
We can only live today

Why would you hold it
Why would you care
Falling back into your memories
But we can only live today

Water runs in one direction
Colors change in the light of day
Our live's are one big high way
And we can only live today ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
