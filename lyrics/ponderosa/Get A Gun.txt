Get a gun, get a gun
Get it

Reverberating voice
Tells me what to take
Something that we love
Something that we hate
Bathing in our homes
Together all alone
Visions of the dead
You'd swear that we are one

Get a gun, get a gun
Get it

The words you read are true
But engineered to be
Something that you want
Or something that you need
All the world remains
If I blow away
Everything I love
And everything I hate

Get a gun, get a gun
Get it.---Lyrics submitted by Hunter Stephens.
