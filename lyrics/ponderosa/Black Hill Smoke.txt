Sunday blues
Forever calling you
I hope she feels it too

Black Hill smoke
You take away my hope
'Til there's nothing in my throat

I gave everything in this world
For that dark-haired girl

Her black lungs
They keep me hanging on
Just keep me hanging on

I gave everything in this world
For that dark-haired girl---Lyrics submitted by Hunter Stephens.
