Morning, morning sun it wakes me
Breathing crowns of mescalito in
Cloudy floating apparitions haunting
Lead me closer to my kin

On high
Holy mountain calling
Space echoes her cry
On high
Holy mountain calling
Space echoes her cry

I ride alone
Now hunting for my family
How I let them slip right through my hands
Noon turns to dusk
And now the sun is setting
Lost and all alone
Adrift in seas of sand

On high
Holy mountain calling
Space echoes her cry
On high
Holy mountain calling
Space echoes her cry---Lyrics submitted by Hunter Stephens.
