Here I am born
From night's dawning
Feel the sun's birth
Hear her calling

Don't, don't stop beating
The ground is wounded
It needs healing
Rain, rain on the ceiling
Raises memories high
Brings is all back to life

Like the snow left in my bed
Beside the note that's never read
How I rest when I'm not sleeping
Before you left you made that bed
And drew the covers back instead
For only one that's left here dreaming

Grass grows up high
Above dead sails
Heat beats dried wood
Strangles old nails

Don't, don't stop beating
The ground is wounded
It needs healing
Rain, rain on the ceiling
Raises memories high
Brings is all back to life

Like the snow left in my bed
Beside the note that's never read
How I rest when I'm not sleeping
Before you left you made that bed
And drew the covers back instead
For only one that's left here dreaming---Lyrics submitted by Hunter Stephens.
