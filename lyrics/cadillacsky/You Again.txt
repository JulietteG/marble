Just out, on parole a new man, a saved soul
Ready to leave that life behind 
Bus ride and a change of clothes, no job, dead broke 
No one wants a man who's done time 
I see someone left the keys in a foreign car ignition 
And I hear an old friend callin my name 

(Chours) 
It's you again temptin me to break in 
And take that Maserati for a ride
I bet you're down there smiling 
Watchin' me drivin 
With your pitch fork poking at my side 
And I feel your fiery touch against my skin
It's You again 

A motel matress covered in hundreds 
A bottle of bourbon on the floor 
Visions of Vegas, fine wine and women 
As I see a bible in the nightstand drawer 
A guilty conconscience sets in, I feel like someone's watchin' 
And I hear an old friend callin my name  

(Chours)
It's you again, askin' me to open 
That King James to Psalm 102 
And your words hit like lightning 
I hear your angels cryin' 
Can't believe I turned my back on you 
And I can't enjoy the fruits of my sins 
It's You again 

Sirens, handcuffs, new trial, same judge 
Disappointed lookin' down at me 

Sayin' It's you again standin' 
In my courtroom beggin' 
Me to show some mercy one more time 
Son I guess you didn't learn your lesson 
Now it's time to pay up for your crime 
You've earned a one way ticket to the pen 
One more word and I'll tack on another ten 
And I heard my cellmate say as I walked in 
Aww, It's You again---Lyrics submitted by Bit.
