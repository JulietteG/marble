Put Your Arms Around Me Baby
Can't You See I Need You So
Hold Me Close Against Your Skin
I'm about To Begin 
Loving You

Spit On Your Hand And Stroke My Cock At A Medium Pace
Play With My Balls And Tell Me How Big They Are
Honey, Rub Your Beaver Up And Down My Face
Sit On The Corner Of The Bed
And Watch Me Wack Off

You See That Shampoo Bottle Now Stick It Up My Ass
Push It In And Out At A Medium Pace
Talk About Your Old Boyfriends Dick And How Big It Was
Now Shave Off My Pubes And Punch Me In The Face

Oh Darling Make Me Push My Dick And Balls Back Between My Legs
Call Me An Ugly Woman And Take My Picture
To Show All The People You Work With

Now Pull Up My Scrotum And Take The Shampoo Bottle Out Of My Ass
Pretend I'm The Pizza Delivery Guy And Watch Me Wack Off
Strap On A Dildo And Make Me Give You Head
Tell Me To Slow Down And Do It At A Medium Pace

Uh, I Feel So Humiliated I'm About To Blow My Load
You Tell Me It's Time To Make Love But Now I Can't 'Cause I Spewed All Over Myself
Then You Look Into My Eyes And You Realize How Much I Enjoy Loving You Ooh
I'm So Sorry I Spunked On My Stomach
Maybe Next Time I'll Be Better At Loving You

OOOO Loving You---Lyrics submitted by Crystal.
