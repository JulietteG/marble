This is a song that uh, theres alot of xmas of songs out there, and ah  not too many  Hanukkah songs, so i wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who dont get to hear any Hanakkah songs.. here we go...

Put on your Yarmulke, here comes Hanukkah
Its so much fun-akkah to celebrate Hanukkah
Hanukkah is the festival of lights.
Instead of one day of presents,we have eight crazy nights.
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree.
Heres a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me,
David Lee Roth lights the Menorrah,
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli,
Bowzer from Sha-na-na and Arthur Fonzarelli.
Paul Newman's half Jewish,Goldie Hawn's half too,
Put them together what a fine lookin Jew.
You don't need deck the halls or jingle bell rock.
Cause you can spin the dreidle with Captain Kirk and Mr Spock-(both Jewish!)
Put on your Yarmulke, it's time for Hanukkah,
The owner of the Seattle Super Sonic-ahs celebrates Hanukkah.
OJ Simpson -- Not a Jew!
But guess who is Hall of Famer -Rod Carew---(he converted!)
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby.
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish not to shabby!
Some people think that Ebeneezer Scrooge is ,
Well, he's not  -but guess who is.. All Three Stooges.
So many Jews are in show-biz.
Tom Cruise  isn't but i heard his agent is.
Tell your friend Veronica,its time you celebrate Hanukkah 
I hope i get a harmonica,on this ,lovely,lovely Hanukkah.
So drink your gin and tonic-ah and smoke your marijuan-icah,
 If you really,really wanna-kah,have a Happy Happy Hanikkah---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
