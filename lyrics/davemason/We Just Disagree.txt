Been away, haven't seen you in a while
How've you been?
Have you changed your style and do you think
That we've grown up differently? Don't seem the same
Seems you've lost your feel for me

Chorus:
So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guys, there ain't no bad guys
There's only you and me and we just disagree
Ooo-ooo-ooho oh-o-whoa

I'm going back to a place that's far away. How 'bout you?
Have you got a place to stay? Why should I care?
When I'm just trying to get along. We were friends
But now it's the end of our love song...
Chorus X 2---Lyrics submitted by Jodine M Kamler.
