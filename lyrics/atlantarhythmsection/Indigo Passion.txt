Life is a colorful thing
Life is a colorful thing... 
From rainbows to rain 
And all of the hills in between 

Indigo passion and chartreuse motels 
Blue mornin's after,  feelin' like hell 
Big yellow taxi - rusty and gray
Comming to take me away 

Blue celebrations with borderline friends 
We go through the motions again and again 
Sometimes it's just not the way that you dream 
But life is a colorful thing 

Life is a colorful thing  Life is a colorful thing
From nightmares to dreams 
From one to the other extreme 

I wrote you a letter that I never sent 
On pale stationary, and here's how it went 
Hello my darling, how have you been, 
Why don't we try it again? 

Indigo passion and chartreuse motels 
Blue mornin's after - feelin' like hell 
It's highly ironic and slightly obscene 
But love is a colorful thing, Love is a colorful thing 

At the end of the tunnel, I know there's a light 
The glimmer of mornin', the twinkle of night 
The white of your smile, the green of your eyes 
Oh what a beautiful sight 

Life is a colorful thing...  Life is a colorful thing
You can say what you will 
But life is a colorful thing
Yeah, from rainbows to rain 
Life is a colorful thing ---Lyrics submitted by craig stripling.
