I've done nothing to prevent myself from slowly breaking down 
I don't know when to stop or to begin 

Unlike everything I do, 
this one proves to be too hard to figure out for me 

And I let the river carry me 
to where ever it may take me 
Too many questions remain unsolved and I wonder why 
God knows I'm in desperate need of some kind of clarity 
But I just can't make up my mind 
But I just can't make up my mind 

O, I got all the answers and I know how to fix this, 
Then how come I never get around to really doing it? 

Too many choices to make and time is slipping away from me 
Me and I, don't see eye to eye 

And I let the river carry me 
to where ever it may take me 
Too many questions remain unsolved and I wonder why 
God knows I'm in desperate need of some sort of clarity 
But I just can't make up my mind 
But I just can't make up my mind 
If I could just make up my mind 

And I let the river carry me 
to where ever it may take me 
Too many questions remain unsolved and I wonder why 
God knows I'm in desperate need of some sort of clarity 
But I just can't make up my mind 
But I just can't make up my mind 
Lord knows I just can't make up my mind 
If I could just make up my mind---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
