I want to, I need 
to make you see how much I care, for you
I could spend my whole lifetime right by your side

One of these days now you'll be leavin'
Sailin' cross the sea to your home
and I'll be standing on the shoreline
waving bye-bye, bye-bye

I never wanted to love you
I only wanted to be your friend
but now I know it's really love I feel
as our time draws to an end

Come December I'll remember
sails against the sun in your eyes
and the shadows on the shoreline
when we kissed goodbye, kissed goodbye

I never wanted to love you
I only wanted to be your friend
but now I'm sure it's really love I feel
so won't you hurry back again

won't you hurry home
hurry home to me---Lyrics submitted by John.
