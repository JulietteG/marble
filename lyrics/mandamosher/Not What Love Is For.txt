The more I hear your words, I listen
But something doesn't fit
Between the vowels and punctuation
The meaning I don't get
You criticize me so completely
Say I should be tough
yeah you love me baby
but I'm never quite enough

It's time for you to face the day
To see that I can hardly breath
Because nobody's keeping score
cuz that's not what love is for
That's just not what love is for

You say you want to see me naked
But turn off all the lights
Your touch at times can be so gentle
and then you'll start a fight
Behind the blurs and trays and gestures
the truth is just a crutch
yeah you love me baby
But you don't like me very much

It's time for you to face the day
To see that I can hardly breath
Because nobody's keeping score
cuz that's not what love is for
That's just not what love is for

No, no, no...no, no, no
I can't take it anymore
no, no, no...no, no, no
that's not what love is for

And I believe that there's a beauty inside
I just realized how it shines
I believe that there's a strength in my soul
I can proudly hold and yes it's mine

It's time for me to face the day
To see that I can hardly breath
Because nobody's keeping score
cuz that's not what love is for
That's just not what love is for

No, no, no...no, no, no
I can't take it anymore
no, no, no...no, no, no
that's not what love is for---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
