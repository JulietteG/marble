I  heard you got yourself a date already.
Funny, I thought you needed your space just five nights ago-ooh-oh-ooh.
I'll bet you'll take her to our favorite spot.
Blanket down, on the ground, and chicken from your momma's stoh-ooh-oh-ove.
And when you pull her in cloh-ooh-oh-ose..

I hope it rains on you!
Maybe a little bit of lightning too.
And I hope it comes a flood, lotsa mud, messin' up your whole day.
Hey, hey.
And I hope it ra-eh-ah-eh-eh-eh-ains.

Don't get me wrong, I hope she's really the one.
And if it's love, I wish you the Be-eh-eh-eh-est.
You'll probably have yourself an outside weddin', violins, all our friends, and her in her pretty white dre-eh-eh-eh-ess.
And right be fore that first ki-eh-eh-eh-iss..

I hope it rains on you!
Maybe a little bit of lightning too.
And I hope it comes a flood, lotsa mud, messin' up your whole day.
Hey, hey.
And I hope it ra-eh-ah-eh-eh-eh-ains.
And I hope it ra-eh-ah-eh-eh-eh-ains.

I hope it rains.
Hope it pours.
I hope that she's in heels and some little white shorts.
You can't find the kets to unlock the doors...

And I hope it rains on you!
Maybe a little bit of lightning too.
And I hope it comes a flood, lotsa mud, messin' up your whole day.
Hey, hey.
And I hope it ra-eh-ah-eh-eh-eh-ains.
And I hope it ra-eh-ah-eh-eh-eh-ains.
And I hope it ra-eh-ah-eh-eh-eh-ains.---Lyrics submitted by Stacie Dawn Haverlock.
