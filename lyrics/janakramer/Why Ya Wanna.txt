Out of all the places in this little town
Yeah you had to come walking in here and sit down
I'm hiding and hoping my face ain't to red
Since we been over been trying like crazy to get you out of my head

Sooo
Why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good don't know what
You were thinkin'
You were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you

I wish you had on sunglasses
To cover up those blue eyes
I wish you said something mean
Made me glad that you said goodbye
Why can't you look off somewhere
If you catch me staring at you
Why can't you be cold like any boy ex would do

Sooo
Why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good don't know what
You were thinkin'
You were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta
Why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Keep wanting you

Why
Why
Why
Would you tell me that you call me up sometime
Maybe we can get a
Drink and and just catch up
Like that be enough
No that ain't enough

Why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good don't know what
You were thinkin'
You were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta
Why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you

Why you gotta
Why you wanna
Make me Keep wanting you

Why you gotta
Why you wanna
Make me Keep wanting you

Out of all the places
In this little town
Yeah you had to come walking in here and sit down---Lyrics submitted by Tami Morales.
