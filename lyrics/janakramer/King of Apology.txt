One, two, three, four

Ooh, ooh, lookin' at you
All I see is another excuse
Me I'm not gonna be
The queen to the king of apology

I've seen it in flowers, seen it in ink
Sticky little notes on the kitchen sink
You're sayin' you're sorry every time I blink
Well enough's enough

You're callin' me sayin' that you'll be late
While your supper's gettin' colder sittin' on the plates
Say you're out with the boys, time slipped away
Like it always does
Well blah blah blah

Ooh, ooh, lookin' at you
All I see is another excuse
Me I'm not gonna be
The queen to the king of apology
Baby you're the king of apology

Baby, save your breath
For the pretty little thing you've been runnin' around with
I'm done forgivin', I'm tired of listenin'
To all your lies

Baby you're out of a one-more-try's
I'm packin' my bags, I'm sayin' goodbye
I'm gonna leave this double white castle behind
Baby far behind
Can't change my mind
No, not this time

Ooh, ooh, lookin' at you
All I see is another excuse
Me I'm not gonna be
The queen to the king of apology

Ooh, ooh, lookin' at you
All I see is another excuse
Me I'm not gonna be
The queen to the king of apology

Ooh, ooh, lookin' at you
All I see is another excuse
Me I'm not gonna be
The queen to the king of apology
Baby you're the king of apology ---Lyrics submitted by Carrie Garvin.
