Mmm... yeah ..

My phone's blowin up,
Everybody wants to know whats up,
When where whats the plan,
Well I'll be there as soon as I can,
Yeah i feel like a good time comin' on,

Oh yeah that's my song,
Turn it up and sing along,
Trouble's gonna melt away,
Once we get by doing our thang,
Yeah I feel like a good time comin' on.

Hey y'all whatcha say,
Get this party started,
We got all we need to have a some fun,
Right now it's all about tonight and not tomorrow,
I feel like a good time comin' on.

Hey yeah x2
Good time comin' on yeah.

Who's that over there,
I hope he didn't see me stare,
Oh lord here he comes,
I don't wanna jump a gun,
But i feel like a good time comin' on

Hey boy whatcha say,
Get this party started,
We got all we need to have a some fun,
Right now it's all about tonight and not tomorrow,
I feel like a good time comin' on.

Hey yeah x2
Good time comin' on yeah.

My phone's blowin up,
Everybody wants to know whats up,
Hey girl were'd you go,
Well all there really needs to know.

If I feel like a good time yeah
I feel like a good time.... Comin' on,
It's comin' on ... Comin' on---Lyrics submitted by Stacie Dawn Haverlock.
