The moon is brighter than the mornin' sun
 The birds sing sweeter and the bees they buzz
 A silly little song and we're hummin' along
 Dancin' like a dandelion swaying in the breeze 
Floating like a butterfly 
Falling like an autumn leaf

Its no ordinary thing
 Between you and me

That's what I love about your love 
Knocks me off my feet 
Takes me on a trip to another galaxy 
Smacks me with a smile 
Longer than a country mile
 Get's my heart runnin' 
Like a river runnin' wild
 I can never get enough
 That's what I love about your love

You lean over.my shoulder
 And it's over and done
 Ain't nothing like the feeling of finding that one
 It's the piece of the puzzle
 Ain't no doubt about it
 It's a good kind of trouble

That's what I love about your love
 Knocks me off my feet
 Takes me on a trip to another galaxy 
Smacks me with a smile
 Longer than a country mile
 Get's my heart runnin' 
Like a river runnin' wild
 I can never get enough 
That's what I love about your love

It puts the hon in my honey
 Oh it puts the fun in my funny
 It's right on the money 
And all of the above
 That's what I love about your love

Knocks me off my feet 
Takes me on a trip to another galaxy 
Smacks me with a smile 
Longer than a country mile
 Get's my heart runnin' 
Like a river runnin' wild
 I can never get enough 
That's what I love about your love

That's what I love about your love
 That's what I love about your love 
That's what I love about your love

The moon is brighter than the morning sun
 The birds sing sweeter 
And they bee's they buzz---Lyrics submitted by tiffany.
