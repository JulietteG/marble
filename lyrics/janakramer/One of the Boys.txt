I'm tired of the high heels
the higher they get the more trouble I'm in
I'm sick of this make-up
Just to take it off and put it on again
I look at those boys in trucks
And think how easy that must be
I'm already ready to shotgun the Chevy 
Boys are you ready for me

Gimme me a ball cap with blue Levi's
I'm hangin' with Jack and Jim
and raisin' 'em high
I might just flirt if I see somethin' I like
Ya I'm just one of the boys tonight

Hey there, I'm talkin' to you
you wanna drink with me
No Honey, I'm buyin' put your money away
This one is free
You might hear a few dirty words
slip out of this prettly little mouth
No Drama Queens causin' scenes
Just the boys throwin' it down

Gimme me a ball cap with blue Levi's
I'm hangin' with Jack and Jim
and raisin' 'em high
I might just flirt if I see somethin' I like
Ya I'm just one of the boys tonight
Come on boys

Put me in a smoky bar with a cold drink in my hand
Light up a fat cigar cus I don't give a damn

Gimme me a ball cap with blue Levi's
I'm hangin' with Jack and Jim
and raisin' 'em high
I might just flirt if I see somethin' I like
Ya I'm just one of the boys tonight
Ya I'm just one of the boys tonight

I could get used to this
This is so much easier than being a girl---Lyrics submitted by Stacie Dawn Haverlock.
