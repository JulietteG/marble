I saw your picture in the paper
Honeymoon in Jamaica, she's a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux
From a ball cap in a pick up, seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young

I got the first kiss
She'll get the last
She's got the future
And I got the past
I got the class ring
She got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy
And she got the man

There's the old you that I knew
Fake ID's to get into those spring break bars
Back woods on a four wheel, I can still feel my racing heart
Now your cleaned up with a hair cut
Nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice
Which would I choose

I got the first kiss
She'll get the last
We each got something, the other will never have
I got the long hair, hot headed
She got the cool and steady hand
I got the boy
And she got the man

I got the boy 
And she got the man---
