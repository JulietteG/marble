I almost didn't answer when I saw your number.
Don't you know that it's 2:18  in the middle of the night?
Did you fight with your girlfriend, could you not sleep, did a strong shot of whiskey leave you feeling  weak?

You only want me when you're lonely.
You only call me when you're down.
You only want me when you're lonely.
But you can't have me now.

I don't know what you expected.
Did you think I'd let you, somehow get the best of me, with some pretty little lies?
I've made that mistake, I've let you crawl back in.
Now I don't have the heart to fall for you again.

You only want me when you're lonely.
You only call me when you're down.
You only want me when you're lonely.
But you can't have me now.

Don't tell me that you love me.
Don't say all the right things.
You're having one of those nights, and I know what that means.
So, you want me right now, but nothings really changed, you're just by yourself.
And it's late, too late.

You only want me when you're lonely.
You only call me when you're down.
You only want me when you're lonely.
But you can't have me now.

You only want me when you're lonely.
But you can't have me now.

You only want me when you're lonely.
But you can't have me now.

You only want me when you're lonely.
But you can't have me now.---Lyrics submitted by Stacie Dawn Haverlock.
