Where was I when you figured out all the little doubts werejust a little too much to conquer?
Where was I in that moment when the curtain fell, and you knew that it was over?

Was I smiling like a fool over morning coffee?
Did you know it was a lie when you said you loved me?
I could've been two wheels up.

I could've been heart healed strong.
This could've been my last tear.
You coud've been so long gone.
I wouldn't be lost like this.
I wouldn't be breaking down.
I would've been over you by now.

What's it like to hold all the cards, to pull all the strings, and convince me that I am dancing?
Maybe you don't know what love really is, cause baby, if you did, you wouldn't let it go so easy. 
Instead of wastin' all that time...

I could've been two wheels up.
I could've been heart healed strong.
This could've been my last tear.
You coud've been so long gone.
I wouldn't be lost like this.
I wouldn't be breaking down.
I would've been over you by now.

I could've met someone new.
I could've been no for you.

I could've been two wheels up.
I could've been heart healed strong.
This could've been my last tear.
You coud've been so long gone.
I wouldn't be lost like this.
I wouldn't be breaking down.
I would've been over you by now.---Lyrics submitted by Stacie Dawn Haverlock.
