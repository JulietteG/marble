Once confined, now discovered your own
Way to cope without being alone
If you've found yourself lost, you must know
What it feels like to be home
And there's no need to think anymore
All this time you were already sure
Your heart whispers in thuds 
It will show you the right way to go

And it says

Hey, we can learn how to love unafraid
Don't repress all the trials you've faced
Do you know, do you know its worth?
Well I'm not sure that you do
Pay no mind to what you have been told
All the things that you think that you know
You could right all the wrongs in my heart
Fix me up with these new parts

And it says

There's a new spark
Flares from a dark heart
Somehow, new start
Flares burst

And it says

There's a new spark
Flares from a dark heart
Somehow, new start
Flares burst---Lyrics submitted by Alexa Borden.
