Cold in the rain, no colors played
And youre still so far away
Though for you ill gladly wait, Ill gladly wait
Straight through the waves of storms I brave
I am strong until I wake
Though Ill stay if I do make it all the way

Ill find a way to you
In this fragile state youre all Im thinking of
I know you want me too
In this idle love

Dead shades, a haze, you brightened me
Tones of grey that covered me
Now youre gone theyre all I see, theyre all I see
Dull, restless time that fuels the fire
Guns a-blazed, for you Ill fight
Still Im frightened all the while

Ill find a way to you
In this fragile state youre all Im thinking of
I know you want me too
In this idle love
Can you feel my desire?
Burning for you now its all Im thinking of
I hope you never tire of this idle love
Of this idle love

This plastic sky sometimes is nothing to what it was with you
Im all yours alright, to hold me back is
Something you could never do
Never do

Ill find a way to you
In this fragile state youre all Im thinking of
I know you want me too
In this idle love
Can you feel my desire?
Burning for you now its all Im thinking of
I hope you never tire of this idle love
Can you feel my desire?
Burning for you now its all Im thinking of
I hope you never tire of this idle love
Of this idle love
In this idle love ---
