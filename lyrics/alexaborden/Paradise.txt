I tie my hair up high
Do what you like
To keep you enticed

I once felt youthful
Now I'm pale an polluted
Blinded by your paradise

If you don't want me
Don't be shy
Leave me, reeling

I do my make-up
Big black eyes
That dress you like
You'll take off tonight

But when you touch me
I wish you were kinder
Wish I'd been wiser
Not blinded by your paradise

If you don't love me
Don't be lyin'
Leave me weak-kneed

Oh, pretty baby
Oh, pretty baby
Oh she's fading

If you don't want me
Don't be shy
Leave me, reeling
If you don't love me
Don't be lyin'
Leave me weak-kneed---Lyrics submitted by Alexa Borden.
