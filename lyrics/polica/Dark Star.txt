What is mine
What is all mine
Not my child not my child
Hold you just a little while
Im gonna give her all my life
Until she's until she's
Swooped up by the sea of love
(x2)

Ain't a man in this world who can pull me down
From my dark star dark star
I will remain there
Its done me good so far
(x2)

What is mine, what is all mine
Not my child not my child
Hold you just a little while
Im gonna give her all my life
Until she's until she's
Swooped up, swooped up, by the sea of love

Ain't a man in this world who can pull me down
From my dark star dark star
I will remain there
It's done me good so far
(x2)

What is mine, oooh
What is all mine
Not my child, not my child
Hold you just a little while
Im gonna give her all my life
Until she's, until she's
Swooped up by the sea of love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
