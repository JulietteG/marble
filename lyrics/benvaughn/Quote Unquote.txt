She said quote unquote I love you
She said quote unquote I do
She said quote unquote I want you
And I never loved nobody but you

She said quote unquote Im lonely
She said quote unquote Im blue
She said quote unquote I miss you
And I never loved nobody but you

When she spoke those words it sounded so good
I believed every single little thing she said
Now shes packing her bags and goin away
And tellin me now it was all in my head

She said quote unquote till the end of time
Quote unquote I do - I do
She said quote unquote till the seas run dry
I never loved nobody but you

When she spoke those words it sounded so good
I believed every single little thing she said
Now shes packin her bags and goin away
And tellin me now it was all in my head

She said quote unquote I love you
She said quote unquote I do - I do
She said quote unquote I want you
And I never loved nobody but you
She said I never loved nobody but you

She said quote unquote
She said quote unquote
She said quote unquote
She said quote unquote---Lyrics submitted by Philippe.
