It's carved in stone
My love for you
It's carved in stone
Baby it's true
It's carved in stone
Now tell me what you gonna do

It's carved in stone
With a chisel in hand
It's carved in stone
To a woman from a man yeah
It's carved in stone
And I'm hopin' that you'll understand

I know it's hard for you to believe
Comin' from a man like me
But baby baby just wait and see
Uh uh uh uh, It's carved in stone
Oh oh oh oh, It's carved in stone
Uh uh uh uh, It's carved in stone
Oh oh oh oh, It's carved in stone

It's the kind of thing that time can't fade
It's the kind of thing that rain won't wash away
My love for you may not be widely known
But it stands on it's own cause it's carved in stone
Uh uh uh uh, It's carved in stone
Oh oh oh oh, It's carved in stone
Uh uh uh uh, It's carved in stone
Oh oh oh oh, It's carved in stone

Solo

It's carved in stone
My love for you
It's carved in stone
Baby it's true
It's carved in stone
Now tell me what you gonna do

It's carved in stone
With a chisel in hand
It's carved in stone
To a woman from a man yeah
It's carved in stone
And I'm hopin' that you'll understand

I know it's hard for you to believe
Comin' from a man like me
But baby baby just wait and see
Uh uh uh uh, It's carved in stone
Oh oh oh oh, It's carved in stone
Uh uh uh uh, It's carved in stone
Oh oh oh oh, It's carved in stone
