Well you ask me how I'm doin'
Well I'm doin' fine
I tell you how I'm doin' and I lay it on a line
I'm growin' a beard
Yeah I'm growin' a beard
I'm growin' a beard pretty mama that's a-a-all I wanna do

Well it's night at five thirteen
You don't agree with me
It makes me oh so mean, baby drives me up a tree
I'm growin' a beard
Yeah I'm growin' a beard
I'm growin' a beard pretty mama that's a-a-all I wanna do

Well people run around
They're runnin' here and there
Me I can't be bothered, I'm just tryin' to grow some hair
I'm growin' a beard
Yeah I'm growin' a beard
I'm growin' a beard pretty mama that's a-a-all I wanna do

Solo

Well you're goin' to the opera
Have a real nice time
Thank you for inviting me but... I must decline
I'm growin' a beard
Yeah I'm growin' a beard
I'm growin' a beard pretty mama that's a-a-all I wanna do

I'm growin' a beard
I'm growin' a beard
I'm growin' a beard
I'm growin' a beard
I'm growin' a beard pretty mama that's all I wanna do---Lyrics submitted by Philippe.
