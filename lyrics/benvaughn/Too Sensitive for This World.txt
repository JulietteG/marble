Ev'ry day starts with a broken heart
I must be too sensitive for this world
Well I know it ain't right to cry ev'ry night
I must be too sensitive for this world
And the world is such a careless place
It's a wonder, hummm it's a wonder
It's a wonder
Anyone survives

The clouds in the sky just make me cry
I must be too sensitive for this world
I don't think I can last until these bad times pass
I must be too sensitive for this world

Solo

And the world is such a careless place
The world is such a selfish place
And life is such an awful fate
It's a wonder, hummm it's a wonder
It's a wonder
Anyone survives

I must be
(Too sensitive for this world)
I gotta be
(Too sensitive for this world)
Sing it one time
(Too sensitive for this world)
Sing it two times
(Too sensitive for this world)
Sing it for your friends
(Too sensitive for this world)
Sing it for your friends again
(Too sensitive for this world)---Lyrics submitted by Philippe.
