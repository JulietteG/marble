By the way I'm not
from Galveston, Texas
I am from Wichita
Wichita, Kansas
People never see here the things they should
I don't know

This are peculiar times
This are peculiar times
And I know I won't go back
to the bittersweet

By the time I hear
the sound of the silence
I might aswell forget
This musical violence
I wonder if I'll ever feel this way again
I don't know

This are peculiar times
This are peculiar times
This are peculiar times
And I know I won't go back
and I know I can't go back
because I'll try to hold back
for the bittersweet

This are peculiar times
This are peculiar times
This are peculiar times
This are peculiar times

Peculiar...

Peculiar...

Peculiar...

Times...

Peculiar...

This are peculiar times.---Lyrics submitted by Raul.
