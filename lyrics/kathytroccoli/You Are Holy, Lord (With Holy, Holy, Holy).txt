Mighty God
Holy, Holy, Holy there is none beside thee
Take my life and let it praise your name
O, Lord Only You are Holy

Holy, Holy, Holy there is none beside thee
Take my life and let it praise your name
O, Lord Only You are Holy

Holy, Holy, Holy there is none beside thee
Take my life and let it praise your name
O, Lord Only You are Holy


Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God almighty
Early in the morning, my soul shall rise to thee
Holy, Holy, Holy merciful and mighty 
God in three persons blessed it trinity

Holy, Holy, Holy there is none beside thee
Take my life and let it praise your name
O, Lord Only You are Holy

End
Only You are Holy---Lyrics submitted by Myra.
