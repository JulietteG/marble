I work hard all week long and the boss gives me my pay
The bills are in the mailbox so I give my money away
Seems like everybody wants somethin' from me
I can't ever give enough
But you give me unbelievable love

I don't win at poker
I ain't won the lottery
No rich uncle ever passed away and left his fortune to me
But when it comes to findin' you baby I can't believe my luck
Cause you give me unbelievable love

Whoa whoa oh oh
(Whoa whoa oh oh)
Whoa oh oh oh
(Whoa oh oh oh)
You give me unbelievable love

Ohhh the power
You move me every day, every hour

Oh when you take me
If this is only a dream, nobody wake me
If I were a rich man
I'd give you everything
Everything ain't even half of the happiness you bring
Cause you make me the king of the world with just your tender lovin' touch
And you give me unbelievable love

Whoa whoa oh oh
(Whoa whoa oh oh)
Whoa oh oh oh
(Whoa oh oh oh)

You give me unbelievable love
(Unbelievable love, unbelievable love)
Repeat
