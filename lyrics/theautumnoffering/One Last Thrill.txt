Please allow me
to say hello,
I'm behind your eyes.
Please allow me
to say hello,
I'm the master
of the lies.

I'll do this for him,
it has always been the same.

I hate to save you,
that's why I'm here
for all your pain.

Please allow me
to say hello,
one more time
for the thrill
as I come in
for the kill.

I'll do this for him,
it has always been the same.

I hate to save you,
that's why I'm here
for all your pain.

Remember when(remember when)
we saw the end(we saw the end),
and said goodbye?

Remember when(remember when)
I came in(I came in),

and showed this sin(and showed this sin)?
Come once again.

Remember when(remember what),
Remember this(remember this),

my sin
my sin---Lyrics submitted by nicole.
