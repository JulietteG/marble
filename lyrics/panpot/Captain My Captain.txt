Set Me Free
Christen me
Navigate me

Throw off your anchor and root me
Root me into the floor of the earth
Where the pressure compression
Makes me feel, any minute
I could burst
Meet me at the helm
Set a course we don't know
Let me ride or sink me
And down we will go
Oh Captain my captain
Set me Free

Life teeming in the darkness
I am alien here
My vision is murky
Nothing is clear
Oh Captain, my Captain
Let me see---Lyrics submitted by Spyros Pampoukis.
