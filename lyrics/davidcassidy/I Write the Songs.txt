I've been lyin' forever
And I will be buried for a song
I put the words and the melodies together
I am music and I write the songs

I write the songs that make the whole worlds sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make those young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

My home lies deep within you
And I've got my own place in your soul
And now, when I look out through your eyes
I'm young again, even thought I'm very old

I write the songs that make the whole worlds sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make those young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

Oh, my music makes you dance
It gives you spirit to take the chance
Girl, wrote some rock'n roll so you could move
Music fills your heart, that's a real fine place to start
It's from me, it's from you, it's from you, it's from me
It's a world-wide symphony

I write the songs that make the whole worlds sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make those young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
