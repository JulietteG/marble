It consumes me, controls me, leaves me with nothing,
But you know I love how it tastes, fear and the fate
I'll change face, to get what I crave
Fill my veins... 

This gets me by 
(you know it feels good, you know it feels so good)
The drugs that keep me high
(you know it feels good, but you know it all feels so fake)

Product of a murderer, you stole everything from me
This poison hurts, feels so empty
Fill my veins with this sin, shaking on the ground,
My head's going crazy from within
Cold sweats, shaking in my shame
Heart stops, dying where I lay

This gets me by 
(you know it feels good, you know it feels so good)
The drugs that keep me high
(you know it feels good, you know it feels so good)
The drugs that keep me...
High, sense of reality, perception falls, feels so empty

Cold sweats, the pain, skin crawls, the shame, please save me
Please save me
This is the way I wanted to live, but you know I was scared of the world,
Praying it all would go away---Lyrics submitted by Nick Thomson.
