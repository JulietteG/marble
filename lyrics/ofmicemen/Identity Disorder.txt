Your heart is a fire,
but the cold is comforting. 
My mouth is a liar,
with my silver tongue in cheek. 

The silence is deafening.
My words cut deep. 
The darkness is blinding,consuming me. 

All I am is what I say. 
So turn your back and walk away. 
My words cut deep,but the silence is deafening. 

I am starving (for something that's real).
So I bite the hand that feeds (they all took from me).
The pieces I'm missing (that's what they want from me)
will be exactly what I need. 

The silence is deafening.
My words cut deep. 
The darkness is blinding,consuming me. 

All I am is what I say. 
So turn your back and walk away. 
My words cut deep,but the silence is deafening. 

I question every part of who I am. 
I question every part of who I am!
It's hard to tell which side of me is in the right,
with these two different people inside of me fighting for my life, fighting for my life.
I question every part of who I am!

The silence is deafening.
My words cut deep.
The darkness is blinding,consuming me. 

All I am is what I say. 
So turn your back and walk away!
My words cut deep, but the silence is deafening!---Lyrics submitted by NiciEatsYourCakex3.
