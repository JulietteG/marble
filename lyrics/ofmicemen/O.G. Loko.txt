I'm coming in hot, 
I'm coming in fast, 
Take my time, 
It's so damn hard
I'll make this last.

I'm the artist, 
Paints in white, 
Your skin canvas, 
I'll leave you scratching, gasping, screaming, screaming

I was lost, 
Until I found myself inside of you

My friend, my love, my life, 
My... truth be told I would, 
Set my whole world on fire
Just to watch it burn in your eyes

Meet my dedication, inspiration
It may be smothering you
But you know it's the truth (x2)

Set my world on fire
It caught spark in your eyes
And now I could see myself with no other baby
I've had you so many times 
But you know I could never get enough of your love

I could never get enough
I could never get enough of your love

Meet my dedication, inspiration
It may be smothering you
But you know it's the truth (x2)

I'm still here
This is faithfulness at it's finest---Lyrics submitted by Ryan Campbell.
