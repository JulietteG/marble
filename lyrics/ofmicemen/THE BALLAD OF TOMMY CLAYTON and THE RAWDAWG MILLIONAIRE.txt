We'll bring you to your knees.
You cannot see something you cannot please.    (x2)

I met a girl with predictable ways.
Open doors, yeah she's here to stay.
Come clean, just open your mind.
Shut those legs girl it's closing time.

Oh faithful, I'm amazed to find you look that way.
Oh faithful, put away the pills come waste away with me.
You see these hospital walls are full from the bodies of all the dead.
It's spreading around the room just like you, 
Wants to be fed.

Bloody hands stop beating hearts.   (x2)
OH! Bloody hands!
We'll bring you to your knees.
How can you be something you cannot see?
We'll bring you to your knees.
How can you see something you cannot please?

Black. Block out the sun.
Blot out your eyes.
Pray for the ones you love.
The sun runs from the sky.
Beg for your life, 
Pray for the ones you love.

Black out the sun.
We'll block out your eyes.
Pray for daylight, 
Your time has come.
This is the get off.
I can't give up now.

Oh faithful, I'm amazed to find you look that way.
Oh faithful, put away the pills come waste away with me.     (x2)

Come waste away with me, it's all in your head!
It's all in your head.
If you see it, just close those blue eyes like you mean it.---Lyrics submitted by Tanya.
