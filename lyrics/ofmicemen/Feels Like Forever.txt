Did you ever contemplate
When all was lost you hesitate
And nothing seems the same.
Have you ever hid your face
In such disgrace, decisions made,
A picture with no frame?

Can you hold on one more day?
Say you're okay
I'm afraid that tomorrow
Is just too far away
Fight the pain
It just feels like forever
Is crashing down on me
Down on me, me, me

Rain will fall, wash all the pain
It shield your soul, you tun the page
To face another day.
Let me know that you will wait
And I will pay for my mistakes
To feel the sun again.

Can you hold on
Say you're okay
I'm afraid that tomorrow
Is just too far away
Fight the pain
It just feels like forever
Is crashing down on me

Don't let go
Time will heal
Just don't let go (don't let go, don't let go)
One day we can learn to start again

Say you're okay
I'm afraid that tomorrow
Is just too far away
Fight the pain
It just feels like forever
(Feels like forever) forever
Is crashing down on me
Down on me, me, me
Down on me---Lyrics submitted by alli Lopez.
