I was all for you
You fell over my love
I just can't afford it this time

Here's a story, just bare with me
Met a drug that changed my life
Something like a classic movie
Just one look all stopped with time
Let her in through these very veins
Coursing through these tired bones
Numb my body
Healed my heart
Soothed my mind
And eased my soul

These are the memories between us
Let it go and let live again
I was all for you
You fell over my love
I just can't afford it this time
I was all for you
You fell over my love
I just can't afford it this time

You let me live
Believing all your life
You let me live your lie
Live your lie
You let me believe
And live your lie
Guess I should have seen this coming
Should have known it all along
You're a fake
See clear right through you
Left me dying it's all your fault

These are the memories between us
Let it go and let live again
I was all for you
You fell over my love
I just can't afford it this time
I was all for you
You fell over my love
I just can't afford it this time

I gave you everything
And you just throw away
Know what I deserve
Know that I should let
Let you go
Let you go
This is me letting you go

I was all for you
You fell over my love
I just can't afford it this time
I was all for you
You fell over my love
Now I'm left with thoughts of suicide

Let you go you're killing me.---Lyrics submitted by Stephany Tisch.
