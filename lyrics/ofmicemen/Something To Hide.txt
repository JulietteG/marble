I can't believe what you tell me
So I just look away
When you realize you fail me
Lying right through your teeth

Anything I see in you
Everything I thought I knew goes away
With every word you say, you betray me

Can you see the other side of things?
Can we be more than what we have become?
I can see that you've got something to hide
Something to hide behind those eyes

Eyes, asleep when they're open
So blind, they keep you awake
Can we fix what is broken?
When will you learn from mistakes?

Anything I see in you
Everything I knew
It goes away

I know I don't need it
I won't be defeated
I won't break
It's you I believed in
But you're keeping secrets
You betray

When you look at me I see right through you

You're a fake
Get out of my face
What a mess you've made

You're blind, disguised
You lie, behind those eyes
You'll find you're out of time ---
