I'm a nightmare and I'm going crazy, you're going nowhere so I'm taking you with me. 
Myself, and I, is all I've got and I don't give a sh- what you say this time? 
You think you know about me? Well I think you're nothing. 
False words fall dead. 

I won't pretend, I wish you were dead. 
I won't pretend, I wish you were dead. 

It just might be me, out of line, you know that. 
I'm a nightmare and I'm going crazy. 
You're going nowhere so I'm taking you with me, 
I'm a nightmare and I'm going crazy. 
You're going nowhere and I'm taking you with me, taking you with me. 

This is what you get when you fuck with a classic roundabout, 
But it just might be me out of line. 
This is what you get when you fuck with a classic roundabout, 
But it just might be me out of line. 

Feel the weight on my shoulders, your legs are giving out. 
Can't scream, can't make a sound. 
I'm dying just to keep sane, 
You'd give up before you'd let me live, 
You'd give up before you'd let me live. 
You know that I, I'm not, better off dead. 
I'm here, alive and I'm relentless, 
I'm relentless, I'm relentless, 
Check it I'm relentless. 

This is what you get when you fuck with a classic roundabout, 
But it just might be me out of line. 
This is what you get when you fuck with a classic roundabout, 
But it just might be me out of line. 

I'm relentless, I'm relentless, I'm relentless---Lyrics submitted by Savacool.
