I never said, I'd be coming back for you.
I never said, I'd be coming back for you, back for you.
I never said that, I wish...

I wish that you could see, feel something or just believe,
But you're not here you're way past dead, your heart, it doesn't bleed.
You took a part of me, ripped from my very soul.
Now I feel like giving up when you're just losing control.

And, I fear that I've married a ghost, you appeared to have this heart of gold, and I fear, that you've sold my soul.
The devils crawling on my back to take you back.

Disguised your demons drag you straight to...
Fuck.
Lying, cheating (Think I don't know what you did?)
Lying, cheating. Think I don't know what you did?

Have many long to breathe, the dead are listening, buried you with my faith, these few last words regret to say.
Can't do this on my own, I can't be all alone, I've held my tongue for far too long this silence kills me...

And, I fear that I've married a ghost, you appeared to have this heart of gold, and I fear, that you've sold my soul.
The devils crawling on my back to take you...

I never said, I'd be coming back for you.
I never said, I'd be coming back for you...
And now I sing (and now I sing), for everything that I've lost.
And now I scream (and now I scream) for everything that I've loved...

Everything

And now we sing (now we sing) for everything that we've lost and now we scream (now we scream) for everything that we've loved...
We left our voices scream, we left our...

And now your demons have found you, and now like shadows surround you, and now these demons have bound you, and they're dragging you back to hell.---Lyrics submitted by TearingMeApart.
