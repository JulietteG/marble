You know that you were my collection,
An addiction out of style.
All these words you said to me,
You know they mean so much.
All these words you said to me,
You know they mean too much to me.

You were nothing but a style.
I wish I could believe that lie.

You were my collection,
An addiction out of style.
All these memories see right through you to me.
I keep losing sleep cause the words you failed to say.
Looking back at mistakes you were wrong.
Should have seen this coming all along.
No days I could take,
No months I could spend at your waste.

Oh, you'll never know.

You were my collection,
An addiction out of style.

You have the crown my only beautiful
Cause tonight we dance on dead men's stones.
"You have the crown so beautifully placed, so beautifully placed.
And we can't be stopped by this alone,
And we'll stop at nothing for you because tonight we dance on dead men's stones."

I don't believe that you're losing sleep, over,
I don't believe that you're losing sleep, over,
I don't believe that you're losing sleep.---Lyrics submitted by Misa.
