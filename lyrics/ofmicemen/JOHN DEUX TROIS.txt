I said it once or twice,
I'm coming down to show you the way to live with my hand.

Enemy, I know you are killing me from inside.
You can laugh
you can laugh, but don't waste my time.
You pessimistic, you cannibal.

Don't believe me, cause I'm already dead.
Don't believe me, I'll take it to the bitter end.
I've been waiting to show you life abundantly.
So, I'll end this talk of who I really am and who I really ought to be.

I won't let you fall back down to the ways that you wanted to escape.
My love, take my hand, I'll show to you everything.
It's not who I am and who you want to.

Enemy, I know you are killing me from inside.
You can laugh 
you can laugh but don't waste my time.
You pessimistic, you cannibal,

For the sake of failing you, my God still lives.
Roll with the pack my God who will make all wrongs right again.
Roll with the pack my son who will make wrongs right again.

I'll show you grace like you never have seen.
grace like you've never seen.
I'll show you
I'll show you grace.---Lyrics submitted by Danielle.
