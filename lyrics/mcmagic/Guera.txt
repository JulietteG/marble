you know they say that life is not far 
but i have also heard
that everybody makes there own destany
i guess thats why god gave everybody free will
so many choices,that we all have to make in this life
and i know we dont spend a whole lot of time on this earth
but i do know that everyday that passes
is a day gone forever and its never coming back
but LOVE is a whole diffrent thing
sometimes we get attached
and no matter how hard we try,we just cant seem to get away       

((chorus))
i would give you my soul
forget them lyes that they tell you
i never want to let you go
said i would give you my soul
foget them lyes that they tell you 
i never want to let you go

come on come on 
her name is guera only 14 with problems at home 
the only person that she trusts is the man that she loves 
he tells her beautiful things and kisses her so right 
she runs away to live with him and his family then comes the fights
to make it worse shes got that morning sickness thing 
ohh damn no body planed it but the babbys on the way
he starts to yell get abusive guera how can you do this thing 
this babby is justing going to kill my boxxing dreams
he want abortion she refuses but they still live together
untill she getts arrested put away in september
now pregnent,in jail and losing her mind
couse he dont care he dont visit he wont even write

((chorus))
i would give you my soul (but she still loves him)
forget them lyes that they tell you 
i never want to let you go (she never wants to let you go)
said i would give you my soul
gorget them lyes that they tell you 
i never want to let you go (she never want to let you go no she never want to let you go)

takes the pin to the paper writingdown what she feels
love hate and sesperation 
like words that can kill close my eyes and i pray 
please change your ways how many times did i cry i see in my babbys eyes
ill do more then you've ever ever done
but now is all for her couse now shes #1
you were sick i was there when i was down you didnt care
you said all i do is yell but if i dont you wont hear
you always had your way even to this very day
but the love you throw away will cost you big one day
i am trapped in love with some one that wont even look at me
so i am begging to the lord GOD HELP ME PLEASE

((chorus))
i wuld give you my soul 
forget them lyes that they tell you 
i never want to let you go
said i would give you my soul
forget them lyes that they tell you
i never want to let you go (she never want to let you x2)
