How can i love you
How can i kiss you
How can i show you what i feel for you
(Somethings i just cant understand, you know)
When you dont even look my way
I dream about you everyday, yes i do

Cmon
Let me ask you something
How can i, stop thinking about you
When youre deep in my soul
When i turn off all the lights,
Your picture stays inside my mind
Like a fantasy i cant reveal
i get emotional inside
sometimes, id rather die
And the worst part you pretend that you dont even know
Like the world keeps turning
But i cant move on
Somebody help me deal with all my crazy situations
To hold you in my arms, my deepest aspirations
Heres my confession, imma tell it to the world
Perfection is when im dreaming that im kissing you girl
i guess im just another case, all because that pretty face
Fantasize about your eyes a million times a day
So if you ever get this message, decide you understand
Maybe you feel the same and wanna let me hold your hand
I promise that ill never let you down and this is true
My life would be so perfect next to you

How can i love you
(How can i love you girl)
How can i kiss you
How can i show you what i feel for you
When you dont even look my way
I dream about you everyday yes i do

Yeah,
Come here girl
I need you mama like the desert needs the rain
Matter fact, rainy nights, i kinda go insane
Cuz when im by your side, its christmas in july
I can see my future when im looking in your eyes
If i ever did you wrong, i apologize
But if i ever did you right, i want the grand prize
Im tired living in this fantasy world
Writing your name a hundred times
But its like you dont even know me girl
Eyes wide open, but im still in the dark
Like an angel from the sky lives inside of my heart
I know one day ill find the strength to say this face to face
And fill you up with happiness so we can runaway
To that perfect destination and make you my queen
Fulfill your fantasies and every dream
So please tell me mama how you feel i gotta know
Se me esta desbaratando el corazn

How can i love you (how)
How can i kiss you (you tell me)
How can i show you what i feel for you
(to show you what i feel for you ma)
When you dont even look my way
I dream about you everyday yes i do
(every day and every night, tell me how) ---Lyrics submitted by tania perez.
