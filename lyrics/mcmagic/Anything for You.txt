baby baby baby baby I would do anything for you
I know that you got somebody else in ur life [yeah I do] but I can't help the way I fell I'm goin insane without you here, and i know she will never let you go and so I cry myselfe to sleep thinkin of what we could of been if u loved me

[MC ]
I rember when we started like love at first sight I was crazy for your kisses and your lovin every night they said we wouldn't make it but we still stuck it through my world wasn't complete if I wasn't right next to yew and I heard it say that that all good things come to an end but you tore my life to pieces when you ran away with him. why? my mind was lost and I  just couldn't understand I'd give the world for you girl ready to die right then , but maybe what we had was just a big mistake and sometimes love slowly turns into hate. I gave it all because of you lost it all because of you and after all this time I think I'm finally over you.

Baby I wish that I had never let you go it's like I hate myself when I realize that I was just so blind to know and I know she will never let you go and so I cry myself to sleep thinkin of wat we could of been if you loved me

Girl it's not that I don't love you deep inside I always will but you lost all my trust and I could never feel the way I did before you ever told me bout him , yew was like my hidden treasure my special little gem, now you say realize that you belong with me, but the only thing I learned is will always lie to me, once a liar always a liar, thats wat ppl said how can I trust the bridge that let me fall into my worst days, my worst nights like fallin of the edge of life, like bein stabbed in the heart with a 100 knives,they say that time heals the pain but I'm still waiting for that day,I'm tired of lookin thru your pictures everyday, but then I see yew face to face must be that smell on your body those lips that I can almost tastes. I start to wonder if yew had a second chance would yew do the same thing to me again?


baby I wish that I had never let yew go it's like I hate myself when I realize that I was just so blind to know , and I know she will never let yew go and so I cry myself to sleep [I TOLD YEW BABY DON'T CRY]yhinkin of wat we could of been if yew loved me
