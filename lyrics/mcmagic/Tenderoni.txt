verse 1
co' on baby

when i sit back 
and close ma eyes
when i got u sitting by side
when i feeel that sexy body
rubbing up all over mine.
that is when i know 
i got a tendoreli
more then a homie
when the lights go down
you are all up on me. damn...
now i gotta show u mamma 
toching places u wannna
so hot like Arizona
in wada California
cause you are ma tendoreni 
that i been tryin'to find
tell me your fanacys
and all your secrets on ur mind 
lets roll on a hotel suit
londery and your preety feet
loook so good that i wanna eat
i think ur twisting me
and i know u love this place
so goo like birthday cake
lets pu it down like Bobby Brown 
and ma man Baby Face

chorus

use to a time
when i skipped the game
always got a girl fora different date
its funny how life takes a sudden change
cause then i all pimp up on ma brain
got one girl that makes me hold all of the other girls are at the front door
was one to be grown 
but i will sit back and drop slow
got a lot of mooney u know that
so let me keep you like a polar cat
get a gicci bag to match
and then get the shows to go with that
i love it when you walk down reprcenting
jay sat suit to the fullest stand---Lyrics submitted by jessie.
