Hey Now... I don't like the way that sounded...
I said, "HEY NOW"...

Hey now (4x)

Frenchmen comin' down... huh?
Fuckin' up the Clowns ... huh?
Chick off the ripitah....
They jackin' up the Lords now

The Mighty Bishops they fightin' grand...
The Mighty Chaplins in the black sedan... 
Oh well they pulled out a shotgun and shoot it with cheese...
All the faggot Bishops started coppin' bad pleas... huh 

Hey now, hey now, hey now hey now...

CHAPLINS!!! WHERE ARE YOU??!
SOUND-OFF BROTHERS! I NEED YOU!

Fort Green, Mau-Maus, Canarsie, Marcy???
Hey Blood! Hey Signatary! Where are you, man?
They fuckin' me up! Ain't even givin' me a "fair one"!
The Patty Boys have taken over the City!
They fuckin up our brother clubs, man!
Even our enemies the Roman Lords are callin' it "cool" 
to fight those hoards of Snow People!
They fuckin' up our Debs!!! Rapin' 'em and slittin' their throats!
Brownsville - Bushwick - Bedstuy...
Black Harlem - Spanish Harlem - and South Bronx...
We gotta get together...
"Oh yeah Chinooo"... Go over to Country's pad, man and tell him to get the big people...
And Chino, tell Country those faggots got all kinds of heat, man.
Machine guns -  rifle - pistols and tanks!!!
And they usin' 'em!
Tell 'em they blew up Harlem - Newark - Detroit and Watts...
And my aunt got shot in the head just for looking outta the window, man!

Viceroys - Dragons - Midgets !!!
"Hey, Batman..." They put you in for "life" for killin' one of those devils...
But don't worry 'bout it Brah, cause we gonna blow those fuckin' walls down;
And not with no ram's horn either.
"Fuck it Brothers, we gonna kill those mother-fuckers !!!"
And we're gonna name you one of the War Counselors, 
One of the War Counselors of our new "clic".
A "clic" baby that will tear this mother-fuckin' nation apart !!!
Can you get to that Batman? Tell the brother in your cell. 
A "clic" of millions and millions of people...
Red - Black - Yellow  and Brown.
Batman,... don't worry 'bout it... 
CAUSE the shit is on !!!---Lyrics submitted by Michael E Chann.
