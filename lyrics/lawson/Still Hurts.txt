Verse 1:
You and me, still hurts
Days go by, gets worse
I dont wanna see you
I dont wanna know where you are
Im scared of these feeling
Im broken and bleeding here without

Chorus:
You  dont know how it feels,
breaking up and falling down
With you  - its never gonna be,
not the way it used to be
everyday it gets harder to breathe.

Verse 2:
You and me, still hurts
though that this could work
Im going out of my head and
Im trying to forget how i miss you (god, i miss you)
And im scared of this feeling
life with no meaning, here without

Chorus:
You  dont know how it feels,
breaking up and falling down
With you  - its never gonna be,
not the way it used to be
everyday it gets harder to breathe.

You  dont know how it feels,
breaking up and falling down
With you  - its never gonna be,
not the way it used to be
everyday it gets harder to breathe

You and me still hurts---Lyrics submitted by Marelle S.
