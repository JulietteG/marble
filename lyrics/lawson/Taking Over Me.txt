(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) x4 
My heart is racing, 
She puts her hands on mine, 
I feel them shaking, 
I look into her eyes, 
And I tell her that it's gonna be alright, 
And I'm never ever gonna make you cry, 
I'll fix your broken heart, 
I'll make it beat again, 
I'll never let you down, on me you can depend, 
And I tell her that we'll always be this way, 
Everyday she's the one that makes me wanna say, 
(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) 
You're taking over me! 
(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) 
I'm in ectasty, 
(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) 
I just can't believe the love, the love, the love, 
It's taking over me! 
The love, the love, the love, 
It's taking over me! 
If I close my eyes, I can see your smile, 
I can hear the laugh, I loved and I can't get enough, 
I can pull you closer in a moment, just like this, 
I can stop the world, with only just your kiss, 
(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) 
You're taking over me! 
(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) 
[ From: ] 
I'm in ectasty, 
(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) 
I just can't believe the love, the love, the love, 
It's taking over me! 
The love, the love, the love, 
It's taking over me! 
(Taking over me) x4 
Touch my skin with your body, 
Love is taking over me, 
Touch my skin with your body, 
Love is taking over me! 
(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) 
You're taking over me! 
(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) 
I'm in ectasty, (yeah, yeah) 
(Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo) 
I just can't believe the love, the love, the love, 
It's taking over me! 
It's taking over me! 
I'm in ectasty! 
I just can't believe the love, the love, the love, 
It's taking over me! 
The love, the love, the love, 
It's taking over me! 
Touch my skin with your body, 
Love is taking over me, 
Touch my skin with your body, 
Love is taking over me!---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Amy Peoplle.
