Everywhere I go
Everything I do
Reminds me of you

Just a picture on the wall
I'm surrounded by it all
Gotta walk before I fall, yeah

Fall out, out on the street
Streetlight, light up for me
So far from where I used to be

When she was mine
Everything was easy
Everything was simple
Never felt so good
When she was mine
I wanted to remember
Never missed a second
Now I wish I could forget

Forget when she was mine, mine, yeah
When she was mine, mine, yeah

What I miss the most
Is talking up all night
We laughed until we cried

Now I'm breaking at the seams
Dropping to my knees
Nothing left of me, no

Like stone turned into dust
My heart wasn't enough
So far from where I used to be

When she was mine
Everything was easy
Everything was simple
Never felt so good
When she was mine
I wanted to remember
Never missed a second
Now I wish I could forget

Forget when she was mine, mine, yeah
When she was mine, mine, yeah
When she was mine

Wonder if she's out there
Wonder where she goes, she goes
Wonder what she's doing
Will I ever know, yeah

Everything was easy
Everything was simple
Never felt so good
When she was mine
I wanted to remember
Never missed a second
Now I wish I could forget

Forget when she was mine, mine, yeah
When she was mine, mine, yeah

I'm down on my knees
Gotta see her, gotta see her, gotta see her, yeah
I tried to forget
But I need her, but I need her, but I need her

I'm down on my knees
Gotta see her, gotta see her, gotta see her
I tried to forget
But I need her, but I need her, but I need her.

When she was mine. ---
