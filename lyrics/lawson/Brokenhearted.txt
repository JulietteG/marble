You're not the girl I used to know
How the hell did you get so cold
I bet you kick yourself to know
Where I've been since you let me go
(yeah)
Now you wanna be with me
(yeah)
But you let your colours show
It's a long way home (home)

Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you brokenhearted
I thought you were all I wanted
All good since the day we parted
Now table's turned, lessons learned,
You got burnt, yeah
Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you broke...brokenhearted

La la la...
La la la...
La la la... [2x]

I was standing in the dark girl,
But now I'm in control
We're a million miles apart
But tell me why you sold your soul
'Cause now you are the lonely one
Since you let your colours show
Baby it's a long way home (home)

Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you brokenhearted
I thought you were all I wanted
All good since the day we parted
Now table's turned, lessons learned,
You got burnt, yeah.
Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you broke...brokenhearted

La la la...
La la la...
La la la... [2x]

[B.o.B]
It's funny how the table's turned
I used to go for you but I was not your main concern
I had to let it burn
Expect the unexpected you never know what you learn
You never know what you do or what you'll get in return
See life is like a mission, you only get what you earn

But you would be in detention you really didn't deserve
But now we're feeling vicious
I kicked the bitch to the curb and you have been booted
That's just how we do it
If I had a remote then you would be muted
But you made your choice and now you feeling foolish
But ask me how I feel
I don't give a Massachusetts (Ha!)

La la la
La la la
La la la

Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you brokenhearted
I thought you were all I wanted
All good since the day we parted
Now table's turned, lessons learned,
You got burnt, yeah.
Hey girl look at what you started
Played with love got you broke...brokenhearted

La la la...
La la la...
La la la...
Now you're living, now you're living
Now you're living with a broken heart
Now you're living, now you're living
Now you're living with a broken heart
Now you're living, now you're living
Played with love got you broke, broken hearted---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
