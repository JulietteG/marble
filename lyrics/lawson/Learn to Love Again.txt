There's a place we know
What's cold won't enough won't grow
we have seen the dark
And the darkness took it's toll
And the journey waits for no one
If no one breaks the mould
And our hearts are stronger than we know

Oohhh

That you and I could learn to love again
After all this time
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one
That you could still believe in me again
After all our trials
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one

To awake and know we made it through the storm
And someone saves their sweet embrace
For you and you alone

Oohhh

That you and I could learn to love again
after all this time
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one
That you could still believe in me again
after all our trials
Maybe that is how I knew you were the one

Oohhh

Silence says we remember
We remember
Two lost souls in the shadow
In the shadows
That is how I knew you were the one
And that is how I knew you were the one.---Lyrics submitted by kelly olivera.
