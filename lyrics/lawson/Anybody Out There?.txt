When the night comes,
its cold, and it rains.
With the lights on, 
its warm, and im brave.
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel my heart?

Oh, is there anybody out there?
Anybody you can call?
You saved me, you take me home.

Theres a fever, 
in the night, and it rains on me.
Theres and answer, 
in your eyes,and its all i need.
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel my heart?

Oh, is there anybody out there?
Anybody you can call?
You saved me, you take me home.

Can you feel my pain?
Feel my, can you feel my pain?
Feel my..

Yeah, is there anybody out there?
Anybody you can call?
You saved me, you take me home.
Oh, is there anybody out there?
Anybody you can call?
Will you save me, will you take me home?

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by Marelle S.
