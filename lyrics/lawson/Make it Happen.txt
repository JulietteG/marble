If you won't love, you gotta give it out
you gotta give it out, give it to me.
If you won't live, you gotta do it now,
we gotta do it now, give it to me yeah.

Ohh, you gotta make it happen, it happen
ohh, you gotta make it happen, it happen yeah.

Lose control, we can sweat it out,
we can sweat it out, just give it to me.
'cause what I need, everything you got,
everything you got, just give it to me, yeah.

Ohh, you gotta make it happen, it happen
ohh, you gotta make it happen, it happen yeah.
Ohh, you gotta make it happen, it happen
if you won't go,
you gotta make it happen, it happen uhh

Ohh, you gotta make it happen, it happen
ohh, you gotta make it happen, it happen

If you won't go, you gotta make it happen, it happen
if you won't go, you gotta make it happen, it happen yeah
Uhhh, uhh uhh uhh---Lyrics submitted by Razeeq.
