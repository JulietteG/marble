Hey! Forgive me father
Up all night
I'm going under
I don't wanna be like you
And you don't wanna be like me

Hey! I play with matches
Roll that dice and hope for magic
I try to let the river flow
And take me somewhere I don't know

Oh oh oh wilde horses in the night
I'm running for my life, yeah

I try to give myself away
To give into the chase
Night turns into day
I drive, drive into the moon
I pray for something new
No matter what I do
All roads leads to you
All roads leads to you

Hey! Can you feel that thunder?
Get in line and take a number
Cos we don't wanna be like them
And they don't wanna be like us

Hey! I've crossed the ocean
Wiped my mind with a million potions
Tryna run away for you
It's a game I think I'll always lose

Oh oh oh wilde horses in the night
I'm running for my life, yeah

I try to give myself away
To give into the chase
Night turns into day
I drive, drive into the moon
I pray for something new
No matter what I do
All roads leads to you
All roads leads to you
All roads leads to you

No matter what I do every road leads right back to you
If I win or lose every road leads right back to you
No matter what I do every road leads right back to you
If I win or lose every road leads right back to you

Oh oh oh wild horses in the night
I'm running for my life, yeah

I try to give myself away
To give into the chase
Night turns into day
I drive, drive into the moon
I pray for something new
No matter what I do
All roads leads to you
All roads leads to you
All roads leads to you

No matter what I do every road leads right back to you
If I win or lose every road leads right back to you
No matter what I do every road leads right back to you
If I win or lose all roads leads to you---
