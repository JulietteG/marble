Oh, Shenandoah
I long to hear you
Away, you rolling river

Oh, Shenandoah
I long to hear you
Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri

'Tis seven long years
Since last I saw you
Away, you rolling river

'Tis seven long years
Since last I saw you
Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri

[Music]

Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

Oh, Shenandoah
I'm bound to leave you
Away, you rolling river

Oh, Shenandoah
I'm bound to leave you
Away, I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri
