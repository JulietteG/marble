I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used
And wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung
No wine untasted.

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame.

And still
I dream hell come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms
We cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different form this hell Im living
so different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed
The dream I dreamed.---Lyrics submitted by Eleanor.
