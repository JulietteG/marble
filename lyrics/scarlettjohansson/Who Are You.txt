They're lining up
To mad dog your tilta whirl
3 shots for a dollar
Win a real live doll
All the lies that you tell
I believed them so well

Take them back
Take them back to your red house
For that fearful leap into the dark
I did my time
In the jail of your arms
Now Ophelia wants to know
Where she should turn

Tell me what did you do
What did you do the last time?
Why don't you do that
Go on ahead and take this the wrong way
Time's not your friend

Do you cry
Do you pray
Do you wish them away
Do you still leave nothing
But bones in the way
Did you bury the carnival
With the lions and all
Excuse me while I sharpen my nails

And just who are you this time?
You look rather tired
Are you pretending to love
Well I hear that it pays well
How do your pistol and your Bible and your
Sleeping pills go?
Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?

Well I fell in love
With your sailor's mouth and your wounded eyes
You better get down on the floor
Don't you know this is war
Tell me who are you this time?
Tell me who are you this time? ---Lyrics submitted by amirul asyraf.
