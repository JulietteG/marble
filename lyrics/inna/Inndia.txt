I hear you calling Inndia!!

(Play&Win;:)
Welcome to India
You dont need nobody but India
Shes enough to make your body go wild
I can live my life here right now.
Its a little bit scandalous
But she lives her life a little bit dangerous
Everybody in the club, can you handle us?
I can live my life here right now.

(Hook: INNA)
Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move?
Are you feeling naughty?
Im gonna hypnotize you
Are you ready for me?
And then youll never say no, no, no.
The sky is the limit
I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize
And your mind off the time.
Uh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no.
Uh, la la la la la la la la
Uh, la la la la la la la la
Uh, la la la la la la la la
I hear you calling Inndia.
Uh, la la la la la la la la
Uh, la la la la la la la la
I hear you calling Inndia.

(Hook: INNA)
Oh, how I rock my body
Can you handle how I move?
Are you feeling naughty?
Im gonna hypnotize you
Are you ready for me?
And then youll never say no, no, no.
The sky is the limit
I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize
And your mind off the time
Uh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no
Uh, la la la la la la la la
Uh, la la la la la la la la
Uh, la la la la la la la la
I hear you calling Inndia.
Uh, la la la la la la la la
Uh, la la la la la la la la
Uh, la la la la la la la la
I hear you calling Inndia.

(Together:)
Everybody stand up
I wanna se your hands up
I wanna see you move your body, girl dont stop
And if youre ballin
Let me hear you callin
Cause well be at the after party, till the morning.
Everybody stand up

Are you feeling naughty?

And then youll never say no, no, no.
The sky is the limit
I can fly, are you with me?
Keep your eyes on your prize
And your mind off the time
Uh baby, you know that you will never say no, no, no.
