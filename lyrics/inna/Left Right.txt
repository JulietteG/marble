Can you hear me?
Call my name twice
Can you feel me?
I treat you so nice
When you`re up here
I feel it`s getting cold
Come around me
And you will see my world

Move with me to the left
And then move with, move with
Move with me to the right
Move with me to the left
And then move with, move with
Move with me to the right

Just dance  x4
So sexy

Move with me to the left


And then move with, move with
Move with me to the right
Move with me to the left
And then move with, move with
Move with me to the right

Just dance  x4

So sexy

Move with me to the left
And then move with, move with
Move with me to the right
Move with me to the left
And then move with, move with
Move with me to the rght

Just dance  x8---Lyrics submitted by aida.
