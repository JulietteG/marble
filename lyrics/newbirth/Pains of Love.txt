(Pa-a-a-ain) the pains of love
(Out) is out to get you, yeah-eah
Give it up
It's gonna get you, yeah
(Pa-a-a-ain) the pains of love
(Out) is out to get you, hey hey yeah
Give it up, oh oh, oh baby, yeah
It's gonna get you, yeah

No matter how you try
Pain will make you cry
Leaving you lost and needing me
When all is lost and there is nothing to gain
The pains of love deep in your heart's still remain
You'll lost, baby, lost, lost, lost
[Lost... lost]
Without me baby, yeah yeah yeah ah

Pa-a-a-a-a-a-ain (out to get you)
It's sure gonna get to you baby
Give it up, ooh Lord
Oh, oo-oooh yeah
It's gonna bound you baby

Pain is misery and suffering
And anagonizing wound
A pain's a birth of a scar that left on
On somebody's heart has been on wrong, wrong, yeah
Huh, and leaves you in distress
God, and then loneliness
All alone
With no one to call your own
It's a bitter pill
It's a hard blow, but that's how it goes
Lonely years
Crying lonely tears, yeah yeah

A month that you were strong
Love had done all wrong
Why am I hurting this way?
You will say
Lord up above, have mercy on me
Why were my eyes too blind to see?
When love is not around
Pain will break you down
And leave you in misery, suffering
Rushing in to love fools will go
Heartbreak lane the pains of love only knows
No matter how you try
Pain will make you cry
Leaving you lost and needing me
You gonna need me, baby
Yes, you will, girl, yeah

You'll be lost, you'll be lost
You'll be lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost
Yeah yeah without me girl, yeah
[you gonna need me]
Ah ahhhhhhhh, listen, girl
[you gonna need me, baby]
[I just want you to understand]
[Alone] said I'm lonely baby, I
[I need you] so blue, I-I-I-I
[oh baby] I'm living all alone
[someone's gonna brea your heart] oh so lonely
[just let you go bad]
[you need to be lost] hey baby
[you've been lost, you gonna need me]
[you gonna need me, baby]
[you gonna think about all the happy times we had together]
[you'll be lost]
