And when your're feeling so alone,
And only you know
That your hand can barely write, 
And there's scream down the line,
And your feeling like your last shot has been fired.

Then your eyes rip into mine,
This is the only day the only night,
And you stand framed against the raging sky.
I'm helpless before the fire.---Lyrics submitted by GDhour.
