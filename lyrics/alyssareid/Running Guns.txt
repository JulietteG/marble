(Chorus)
Do you feel, do you feel alone?
Do you feel, do you feel alone?

(Verse)
Is this over or Im not it?
Were not okay, oh, Im not it.
You pull the trigger, oh, Im not it,
I wont do it, oh, Im not it.

(Pre-Chorus)
Young one, what have you done?
Theyre running guns, theyre running guns.
Young one, what have you done?
Theyre running guns, theyre running guns.

(Chorus)
Do you feel, do you feel alone?
Do you feel, do you feel alone?

(Verse)
Youre always broken, oh, Im not it,
I cannot stay, oh, Im not it.
Its getting old, now, oh, Im not it,
Im not okay, oh, Im not it.

(Pre-Chorus)
Young one, what have you done?
Theyre running guns, theyre running guns.
Young one, what have you done?
Theyre running guns, theyre running guns.

(Chorus)
Do you feel, do you feel alone?
Do you feel, do you feel alone?---Lyrics submitted by mojtaba.
