Heaven has sent you from above, baby
Love that I needed for so long baby
Never before did I feel this heart break
Thrill to you baby
Tho' I'm far away
Oh tell me why was my life
Never sweet as soul when soul cries
Can you open my eyes and let me know where love lies

Try to be close to me
Never let me go, girl
TLC finally
Dont ever let me go
Let me hear you say so
I was a witness to disharmony
Somebody taking away another part of me
Tell me why was my life
Never sweet as soul when soul cries
Can you open my eyes
And let me know where love lies
Try to be close to me
Never let me go, girl
TLC finally
Dont ever let me go
Let me hear you say so
Play it out, never doubt
Never let me go
lt's all about reaching out
Never let me go---
