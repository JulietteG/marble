We've been through love time and time again
Tried for true love with enemies and friends
Looked at romance every way
Now my heart can't take that anymore anyway
Oh anymore

Let me be the one
One with you
Let me be the one
To make your dreams come true
All I wanna do
Is be with you one day
Let me be the one
One heart, one way

You've been let down
Youve been left alone
And remember when I took you home
We looked at our lives every way
Now our souls can't take that anymore
Oh no, oh no way

Let me be the one
One with you
With you
Let me be the one
To make your dreams come true
To make your dreams come true
All I wanna do
Is be with you one day
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
One heart, one heart

Whoa I, I wanna know how you feel
Let your whole heart get in the way
If you don't know, think of something tender to say
As long as its me, then it's alright

Let me be the one
One with you
With you
Let me be the one
To make your dreams come true
To make your dreams come true
All I wanna do
Is be with you one day
Let me be the one
Let me be the one
One heart, one way---
