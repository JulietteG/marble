Babys gone
Said shes movin on
Telling me
I aint comin along
I thought you said you were satisfied
You've given up on everything we tried for, why?

How can you justify sacrificing our love
Justify
Sacrificing our love

Smoking gun
HoId it in your hand
You can't deny
I'm the victim of your plan
Innocence with a guilty side
I don't understand
Tell me why oh why

How can you justify sacrificing our love
Justify
Sacrificing our love

Lonely hearts finally find a home
Then they part
Like everybody does
Guess the love meant more to me
Go your way
But I can't see...why

How can you justify sacrificing our love
Justify
Sacrificing our love---
