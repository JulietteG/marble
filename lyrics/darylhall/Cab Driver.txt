Standing in the rain
Cab comes into view
Ask me, "Where am I goin to?"
Running for so long
Been gone too many nights
And my heart has paid the price
This ain't heaven
This aint the life bargained for
My reason for living
Isnt here inside this car
Girl, I gotta get back to you

Cab driver
Take me home
Spent too much time away
Too much time alone
Cab driver
Take me home
Spent too much time away from my baby

I need familiar streets
To show that you're near
Feeling like a stranger here
Oh does the mirror show the miles on my face
Am I goin' any place?

This ain't heaven
This aint the life I was hopin for
My reason for living
Sure aint here inside this car
You know I've gotta get back to you

Cab driver
Take me home
Spent too much time away
Too much time alone
Cab driver
Take me home
Spent too much time away from my baby

I need to see the look on your face
A kiss from your lips...oh the taste, baby
Nothing waiting for me but a lonely room
Ive gotta get back to you baby - soon

Cab driver
Take me home
Spent too much time away
Too much time alone
Cab driver
Take me home
Spent too much time away from my baby---
