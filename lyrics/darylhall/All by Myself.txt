I can see the anger
and I surely feel
All the passion, baby gone astray
Why are we divided
so dissatisfied

Does it matter what we do or say
I can't see the wisdom
Never gonna give in
When the love is not so far away
I was hoping for more
I'm still hoping for sure

Isn't anybody dreamin'
Isn't anybody thinking
Or am I all by myself
Isn't anybody teachin'
Why is everybody preachin'
Am I all by myself

Don't you feel it lately
That you're the only one
Who can see through bitter lies right here
Like everybody knows it
But no one seems to care
As if there's something in the truth we fear

Aren't you hoping for more
I'm still hoping for sure
Isn't anybody dreamin'
Isn't anybody thinking
And all by myself
Isn't anybody lovin'
Isn't anybody huggin'

Am I all by myself, tell me, tell me
Am I all by myself
All by myself
Come on everybody teach it with me
Am I all by myself
Don't wanna be all by myself
Come on everybody preach it with me---
