I wanna know what you dream, oh baby
Am I one with your fantasy
I wanna show you my deepest feelings
Aint that how loves supposed to be

Give me love
Hold on to me
Give me hope
Hold on to me
Give me dreams
Hold on
Oh baby, give it up
Give me heart
Hold on to me
Give me soul
Hold on to me
Give me your smile
Hold on
Oh baby, give it all

I had enough of bad luck, oh baby,
All those nights that I cant replace
But none of the love in my past can claim me
Others go but you dont fade away

Give me love Hold on to me
Give me hope Hold on to me
Give me dreams Hold on
Oh baby, give it up
Give me heart
Hold on to me
Give me soul
Hold on to me
Give me your life
Hold on
Oh baby, give it all

I know in my heart its real
Know this is love I feel
If something aint right just say so baby
Dont let go...dont stay away...stay with me

Give me love Hold on to me
Give me hope Hold on to me
Give me dreams Hold on
Oh baby, give it up
Give me heart
Hold on to me
Give me soul
Hold on to me
Give me your life
Hold on
Oh baby, give it all---
