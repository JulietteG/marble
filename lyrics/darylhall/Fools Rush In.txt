Just why do I want you baby
Anyone but a fool would let it be
Go on anywhere you take me
I don't want to know what's pulling me
If I fall so deep
With my eyes so wide
Then I hope that feeling isnt only mine

Fools rush in
Where the wise dont go
Fools rush in
And Im a fool for love
Fools rush in
But the wise dont know
Fools rush in

Safe advice
I can't let it stop me
Love dont wanna know the reason why
If we fall so deep
With our eyes so wide
Then I know the feeling isn't
only mine

Fools rush in
Where the wise dont go
Fools rush in
And Im a fool for love
Fools rush in
But the wise dont know
Fools rush in---
