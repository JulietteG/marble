Melting pot
I never want an easy life if me and he were ever to get there
Oh my life it's started again
You can't know we're ever the same
I feel it, i just can't get the scene to fit
Save me, i wanna stick with the sights
Shoot it up and go for a ride
I fly, she drives over the wall
Kick out all those humans and all
I want it, i just can't seem to get to it
Tv culture it's only a style,
An overdose, it's a part of every time

Melting pot
I never want an easy life if me and he were ever to get there---Lyrics submitted by tinashe.
