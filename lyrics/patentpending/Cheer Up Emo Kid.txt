I've got a problem with everyone I know
I've got a problem I want everyone to know
I got home late last night from the punk (PUNK) rock (ROCK) show
I say it sucked because I'm emo

I'm gonna cry, I'm gonna scream 
I'm gonna say what I don't mean
I'm gonna cry, I'm gonna mope
I'm gonna give up all my hope
Bringing everybody down
Everybody with a frown
Bringing everybody down
Wait for death to come around

Cheer up emo kid
It's a brand new day
Cheer up emo kid
It'll be okay
Cheer up emo kid
It's a brand new day
Cheer up emo kid
It'll be okay

I like to listen to my favorite band The Cure
I'd ask her out but she'd say no!
No for sure

I'm gonna cry, I'm gonna scream 
I'm gonna say what I don't mean
I'm gonna cry, I'm gonna mope
I'm gonna give up all my hope
Bringing everybody down
Everybody with a frown
Bringing everybody down
Wait for death to come around

Cheer up emo kid
It's a brand new day
Cheer up emo kid
It'll be okay
Cheer up emo kid
It's a brand new day
Cheer up emo kid
It'll be okay

Cheer up emo kid
It's a brand new day
Cheer up emo kid
It'll be okay
Cheer up emo kid
It's a brand new day
Cheer up emo kid
It'll be okay

Cheer up emo kid
Nobody likes me, everybody hates me
Cheer up emo kid
Nobody likes me, everybody hates me
Cheer up emo kid
Nobody likes me, everybody hates me
Cheer up emo kid
Nobody likes me, everybody hates me

Nobody likes me
Everybody hates me
Nobody likes me
Everybody hates me
Nobody likes me
Everybody hates me
Nobody likes me
Everybody hates me

Nobody likes me, everybody hates me
Nobody likes me, everybody hates me
Nobody likes me, everybody hates me 
Nobody likes me
I guess I'll go eat worms!---Lyrics submitted by kristina.
