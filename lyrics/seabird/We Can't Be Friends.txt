this is the start of the end
this is a start of a mess
I don't think we should pretend
that this is anything less than over

let me make it crystal clear

we can't be friends
we can't be friends
you did what you did
and I said what I said

already told you
don't wanna know you anymore
so get it through your head
we can't be friends

stop trying so hard
were so much better apart
you can't just rip out my heart
and then just keep going on like we're not over

let me make it crystal clear

we can't be friends
we can't be friends
you did what you did
and I said what I said

already told you
don't want to know you anymore
so get it through your head
we can't be friends

I wish I could erase my memories
said i never had it in me
swear ill find a way to move along

you may as well erase my number
i already burned your letters
find enough of you when you are gone

we can't be friends
we can't be friends
you did what you did
and I said what I said

already told you I don't want to know you anymore
so get it through your head

we can't be friends
we can't be friends
you did what you did
and I said what I said

already told you don't want to know you anymore
so get it through your head
we can't be friends---Lyrics submitted by Andrew Finch.
