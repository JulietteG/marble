I can see it won't be easy
to keep your head above water
Without a good friend by your side,
I can tell you it'll only get harder

Hold on, child hold on, 
the Good King is near
So near
Hold on, child hold on, 
the Good King is strong
In His eyes,
you ain't done nothin' wrong

I know you feel alone,
got no place to call your home
And it feels all wrong
Your certainty in life
melts quicker than the ice
That you're standing on

Hold on, child hold on, 
the Good King is near
So near
Hold on, child hold on, 
the Good King is strong
In His eyes,
you ain't done nothin' wrong

When I had no choice, 
He gave me a voice
Now I'm singing
Yes, I'm singing
And it wasn't long before
You gave me a song
Worth singing
Yeah, I'm singing

Hold on, child hold on, 
the Good King is near
Hold on, child hold on,
the Good King is near
So near
Hold on, child hold on, 
the Good King is strong
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
child hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
child hold on
In His eyes, 
you ain't done nothin' wrong

In His eyes, 
you ain't done nothin' wrong
Yeah, you ain't done nothing wrong---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
