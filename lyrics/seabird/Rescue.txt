im pushing up daisies, i wish they were roses
i feel like im drownin, but nobody knows it
im pushing up daisies, i wish they were roses
i feel like im dying, just want you to notice

somehow the grave has captured me, show me the man i used to be
just when i feel my breath is running out, the earth moves and you find me
alive but unworthy, broken and empty, but you dont care
cause you are my rapture, you are my savior
when all my hope is gone i reach for you
you are my rescue
you are my rescue

im swimming to safety, but even with my best
if i dont see a rose soon, this might be my last breath

somehow the grave has captured me, show me the man i used to be
just when i feel my breath is running out, the earth moves and you find me
alive but unworthy, broken and empty, but you dont care
cause you are my rapture, you are my savior
when all my hope is gone i reach for you
you are my rescue

dont let me drown, can you hear me cause i am calling out
im underground, wont you pull me out

the earth moves and you found me, alive but unworthy
broken and empty, but you dont care
cause you are my rapture, you are my savior
when all my hope is gone i reach for you
you are my rescue
you are my rescue
yeah, you are my rescue
yeah, you are my rescue


im pushing up daisies, wish they were roses
feel like im dying, just want you to notice---Lyrics submitted by carly.
