INTRO:
i hope this song will find u awake,
cause wat i need to say cant wait;
ive loved u since we were just babes,
the world can try but we wont change.

CHORUS:
cause im fallin im fallin for u,
o darlin its finally true;

2ND VERSE:
i hope this song brings u back to life,
cause i can see the fear in those eyes;
i promise u if we just try,
well take this wrong and make it right.

CHORUS+3RD VERSE:
cause im fallin im fallin for u,
o darlin its finally true;
and someday ill break ur fall too,
cause im fallin im fallin for u.


"PIANO BREAK"


FINAL CHORUS:
im fallin im fallin for u,
o darlin its finally true;

OUTRO:
and i wont let your heart turn to stone,
cause when i found u,
my heart found a home;
yea when i found u,
my heart found a home.---Lyrics submitted by Weston.
