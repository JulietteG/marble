At arms length
You held your spouse and children
Your lack of grace
So nearly killed them
Again there still breaths
He may not wake for years
You promised me still
This wont end in tears

Cause youre not alone
No were not alone
Now honey
Save your own 
Cause were not alone

Back home to find
A garden as you left it
Roses in full bloom
So glad you invested
So you found 
This room couldnt hold you down
Step through these walls
And listen through the sound

Not alone
No were not alone
Now honey
Save your own 
Cause were not alone

Not alone
No were not alone
Now honey
Well make it home
Cause were not alone

Hold us close, it meant so much
Maybe more than you knew
Laugh a while, burn like fire
Love us again just like you used to
Sing so loud, make us proud
Please say just what you heard
Listen closer, hold your tongue
Your tired eyes speak louder than words
Speak louder than words, come on, oh...

Not alone
No were not alone
Now honey
Save your own
Cause were not alone

Not alone
No were not alone
Now honey
Well make it home
Cause were not alone

Not alone
No were not alone
Now honey
Save your own
Cause were not alone

Not alone
No were not alone
Now honey
Well make it home
Cause were not alone---Lyrics submitted by Moriah.
