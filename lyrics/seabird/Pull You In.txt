Remember the day that I first met you.
I thought these hands of mine could catch you.
But I was the one, I was the one, fallin' down.

When I was young I thought I could carry you.
Would you be saver in my arms if I just married you?
No I didn't see it, I didn't see this until now.

'N all my life, I said I would fight for you, cry for you, said I would die for you.
But I realize now,
the rope isn't long enough, i wasn't strong enough,
to pull you in.
To pull you in.
And baby forgive me for thinking, that I could pull you in.

I know a love that runs so deep.
Deeper still than the pain that you keep.
Your holdin' on, holdin' on, so tight.
So fall apart, cause what I want lies inside.

' N all my life, I said I would fight for you, cry for you, said I would die for you.
But I realize now,
the rope wasn't long enough, i wasn't strong enough,
to pull you in.
To pull you in.

And baby forgive me, 
I tried to say to you, but what I just break you,
But baby that is not what I want.
I tried to say to you, but what I just break you,
But baby that is not what I want.

No I can't pull you in.
No I can't pull you in.
No I can't pull you in.
No I can't pull you in.

And baby forgive me for thinkin'...
And baby forgive me for thinkin'...
That I could pull you in.---Lyrics submitted by Kristan Dagley.
