We were in love
What does that mean?
If you walk out, that really changes things

When you came home 
from lasts night's binge
You could not find the words to say just what you did

Can we revive 
a love expired, 
beneath the smoke. Can we escape a home on fire?

Something better change soon
'cause baby I can see the light in you
is burning out
Let's slow it down for you
Baby I can slow it down for you

We were alive
What does that mean?
If I change my mind, that really changes things

But I made a choice
Forgotten then
to love you alone until I take my final breath

And I will not run
Or leave your side
'til you believe my love for you will never die

Something better change soon
'cause baby I can see the light in you
is burning out
Let's slow it down for you
Baby I can slow it down for you

Something better change soon
'cause baby I can see the light in you
is burning out
Let's slow it down for you
slow it down for you
Baby I can slow it down for you...---Lyrics submitted by Chelsea Dagger.
