Where the woods would wear the wafting sounds of sea 
Roves an oath, in search for something more to be 
"Still hard for me" 

Treading lightly, tightly shedding its old skin 
Leaving trails of night for light to bring chagrin 
While air grows thin 

Wailing winds, alarm, in feathers it have dressed 
Surrounding what's left inside its chest 
We too shall rest 

Roaring lungs, as oath becomes through flight past trees 
Only the rhythm of love escapes the harmonies 
Leaving us a beat 

In these hands I'll hide, in these hands I'll hide 
While this world collides, this world collides 
It's not enough for me, it's not enough for me 

In these hands I'll hide, in these hands I'll hide 
(Where the woods would wear the wafting sounds of sea) 
While this world collides, this world collides 
(Where the woods would wear the wafting sounds of sea) 
It's not enough for me, it's not enough for me 

In these hands I'll hide, in these hands I'll hide 
While this world collides, this world collides 
It's not enough for me, it's not enough for me ---
