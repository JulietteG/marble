It isn't easy to say goodbye,
I try to understand the reason why
My body's shaking, my heart is aching within me.
From my window I watch you go,
He's waiting for you in the street below,
His arms wide open, while mine are cold and so empty.

(Chorus)
'Cause your world and my world-they've drifted apart,
In yours the sun is shining,
In mine it's raining,
And I'm the only lonely one.

And your life and my life-they've gone separate ways,
In yours a new tomorrow,
In mine just sorrow,
And I'm the only lonely one.

Through the teardrops that cloud my eyes,
I see the image of a love gone by,
A silhouette that I won't forget for a long time.
The days are longer now that you're gone,
Without your loving arms to keep me warm
My future lies under cloudy skies
With no sunshine.---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
