Got on board a westbound seven-forty-seven
Didn't think before deciding what to do-
All that talk of opportunities
TV breaks and movies
Rong true
Sore rang true

Seems it never rains in Southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California
But, girl
Don't they warm ya
It pours, man, it pours

Out of work, I'm out of my head
Out of self-respect
Underloved and underfed
I wanna go home
It never rains in California
But, girl
Don't they warm ya
It pours, man, it pours!

Will you tell the forks back home
I nearly made it
Head offers, but don't know which one to take
Please don't tell them how you found me
Gimme a break
Gimme a break

Seems it never rains in Southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California
But, girl
Don't they warm ya
It pours, man, it pours!---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
