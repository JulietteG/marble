Call your name and spinning while I sigh
Drown my eyes at the summer sky
Say goodbye to the happy times
Say goodbye
Fail to keep the memories on my...sigh
Love so much that I can't survive
Love so much, feelin dead inside
Dead inside
**Japanese**
Me and Mary
La La La La x8

Maybe we really had a simple time
I can't explain what I mean sometimes 
So goodbye
Spending all my time and the I decide
I've asked too much, but I can't say why
I've asked too much, but I can't say why if I liked

**Japanese**
Me and Mary
Ou Ou x8

Call your name and spinning while I sigh
Drown my eyes at the summer sky
Say goodbye to the happy times
Say goodbye
**Japanese**

Me and Mary
Me and Mary
Me and Mary
