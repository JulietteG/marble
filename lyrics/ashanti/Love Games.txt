Lets play a game
Whatever start I kiss you right, you kiss me

You kiss me there, Ill kiss you back
Lets play a game
You got my front, I got yo back
You kiss me there, Ill kiss you back
Lets play a game
I kiss you there, youll kiss me back
Lets play a game
I got yo front, you got

Say youre gonna kiss me when I kiss you right baby
I aint one of them girls thats scared (I cant)
And Imma make you feel like youve never felt before
Imma pull my hair back and give it to you one more

See in life I dont like to play games
But because its you and I, I am here, Im ready
So give me one hit, two hits, three hits, homerun
Put your hands all over me, said that its not funny

You kiss me there, Ill kiss you back
Lets play a game
You got my front, I got yo back
You kiss me there, Ill kiss you back
Lets play a game
I kiss you there, youll kiss me back

You know Im finna get you back, baby

You can be head in charge
I just think
Maybe we should play them games
Hide and seek
Might spin a little jiving
We can take it low
Yea, I let go off them dollas
If you can take that low
I just got an extra 5 yea, got you throwed up loose
I dare you to drop em
Girl we can skip the truth
Oh when Im kissin you there while you kissin me back
Red light, green light, just like that
Using my fingers like finger I win
Switchin these positions like a twisted ending girl

You kiss me there, Ill kiss you back
(You kiss me there, Ill kiss you back)
Lets play a game
(Lets play a game)
You got my front, I got yo back
(You got my front, I got yo back)
You kiss me there, Ill kiss you back
Lets play a game
I kiss you there, youll kiss me back
Lets play a game
I got yo front, you got

You got my front, I got yo back baby
You got my front, I got yo back baby
Ha, the way you arch yo back
The way you lookin back at it man, I swear you aint felt it like this---
