Every moment I am thanking my soul
Feel so lucky having you in my arms
Wouldn't be the same without you babe
There's not a thing about you I would change
I'm incomplete when you're far away
And when you're here you make me whole again
At first I really didn't trust it or believe it
I found someone that'd make me say this and mean it

Chorus:
Couldn't imagine life without you
I wanna rap my arms around you
You're like a miracle in the form of a man
I wanna gently kiss yo' face
Couldn't imagine life without you
I wanna rap my arms around you
You're like a miracle in the form of a man
I just wanna kiss yo' face

Sometimes I have to stop and stare
Might even run my fingers through ya hair
Just to see that this is not a dream
I've gotta see ya smiling back at me
And I'm okay as long as you're okay
Don't have to ask I know you feel the same
At first I really didn't trust it or believe it
I found someone that'd make me say this and mean it

Chorus:
Couldn't imagine life without you
I wanna rap my arms around you
You're like a miracle in the form of a man
I wanna gently kiss yo' face
Couldn't imagine life without you
I wanna rap my arms around you
You're like a miracle in the form of a man
I just wanna kiss yo' face

Remember when I used to think 
there was nobody there for me
It took a while for me to know 
someone could really touch my soul
No one can ever come between
They can't take you away from me
I'll always be right by your side
So I can say that you are mine

I always want you here with me
Don't ever wanna see ya leave
I always want you here with me
Don't ever wanna see ya leave

Chorus:
Couldn't imagine life without you
I wanna rap my arms around you
You're like a miracle in the form of a man
I wanna gently kiss yo' face
Couldn't imagine life without you
I wanna rap my arms around you
You're like a miracle in the form of a man
I just wanna kiss yo' face

Couldn't imagine life without you
I wanna rap my arms around you
You're like a miracle in the form of a man
I wanna gently kiss yo' face
Couldn't imagine life without you
I wanna rap my arms around you
You're like a miracle in the form of a man
I just wanna kiss yo' face---Lyrics submitted by Maria.
