Aahhh..
I just want you to know
That, Threw out it all that stuck by me
It's only you
That stop by me
And for that, I thank you
I love you
Ashanti

{Ashanti...}

Oooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oooh, I just can't leave you alone
Boy you got me doing things that I would never do.{never do}
And I can't stop the way I'm feeling if I wanted to.
I'm crazy about the way that you could make me say your name,
And if I couldn't have you I would probably go insane

But only you can make me feel
(Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(And only you can take me there)
And only you can make me feel
(Only you, Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Oooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oooh, I just can't leave you alone
Boy you stay inside in my mind, ain't no denying that.(denying that)
Only you could do them things that got me coming back
This gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt
And I do what I gotta do to keep you to myself

But only you can make me feel
(Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(And only you can take me there)
And only you can make me feel
(Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Crazy, 'Bout the, Way you, Feel
I just, Gotta, Have you, Here
And I, Want to, Let you, Know, 
I won't, Ever, Let you, Go

Only you can make me feel
(Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(And only you van take me there)
And only you can make me feel
(You can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Oooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oooh, I just can't leave you alone
