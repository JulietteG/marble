I couldn't
Fall asleep
Late last night
Thinking what
We had
Just might be
All over baby
And I don't know
If you meant
What you said
When you told me
You was sick
Of trying
You was sick
Of fighting
Crying, lying
Didn't wanna do
This again
We really said
Some things
We really did
Some things
We should've
Never did
And we both know
It takes more
Just to apologize
But from what
I'm feeling inside
Boy I'm yours
And boy you're mine

And even if I said
I was leaving babe
I couldn't picture
No more you and me
See
I ain't perfect babe
And you
Ain't perfect baby
So listen
To the realest thing
I could say

Sometimes
It's a struggle babe
And it only hurts
Cause I love you baby
And for
What it's worth
I will struggle babe
Cause I wanna be
In your life
I'ma keep trying

Over and over
And over again
And over again
Over and over
And over again
And over again

See
We done been together
For a few years now
Ain't no way
We just gon' sit
Right here
And throw it out
See even if
It's my mistake
Or if
It's your mistake
And then we scream
And shout
You gotta know
I love you babe
And I'ma
Show you babe
That we could work
This out

So many nights
We would tear
Rooms up
In this house
We both know
We both know
What is this about
When I look
Into your eyes
I'm in your heart
And you are in mine

And even if I said
I was leaving babe
I couldn't picture
No more you and me
See
I ain't perfect babe
And you
Ain't perfect baby
So listen
To the realest thing
I could say

Sometimes
It's a struggle babe
And it only hurts
Cause I love you, baby
And for
What it's worth
I will struggle babe
Cause I wanna be
In your life
I'ma keep trying

Over and over
And over again
And over again
Over and over
And over again
And over again

And I don't wanna
Be alone baby
Cause you are everything
I know baby
See
You're everything I need
And you're everything I see
And you're everything I feel
And you're everything to me
And I don't wanna
Be alone, baby
Cause you are everything
I know baby
See
You're everything I need
And you're everything I see
And you're everything I feel
And you're everything to me

Sometimes
It's a struggle, babe
And it only hurts
Cause I love you baby
And for
What it's worth
I will struggle babe
Cause I wanna be
In your life
I'ma keep trying

Over and over
And over again
And over again
Over and over
And over again
And over again---Lyrics submitted by Patricia.
