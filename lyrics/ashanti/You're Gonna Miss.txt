It's killin' me to think that you don't want it no more
I should've learned my lesson when you f*cked up before
You said some things (I said some things) seems like this thing is over
Cause you ain't call, since you've been gone

[Pre Chorus]
But I ain't gonna stress about it anymore
And I ain't gonna cry another night, no
You're gonna miss this chick right here
You're gonna miss this chick, I swear

[Verse 2]
I hate to admit it, my heart was all in it
Like a fatal attraction happened, cause now it's killin' me
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't breathe
I just want you back with me baby

I can't help but think that when your love is gone
I'm gonna find it hard to keep myself from holdin' on
And when I try to justify what you did wrong
It's like I'm constantly reminded that I can't move on

[Pre Chorus]
But I ain't gonna stress about it anymore
And I ain't gonna cry another night, no
You're gonna miss this chick right here
You're gonna miss this chick, I swear

[Bridge]
I'm tired of thinkin' that we could've made it, my heart keeps on achin
And I just can't take it, hey
I feel so weak (I can't breathe) I just want you back with me baby

I can't help but think that when your love is gone
I'm gonna find it hard to keep myself from holdin' on
And when I try to justify what you did wrong
It's like I'm constantly reminded that I can't move on

[Pre Chorus/Chorus]
See ain't nobody's out there like mine, you're in it for the very last time
You're gonna miss this chick right here, you're gonna miss this I swear

But I ain't gonna stress about it anymore
And I ain't gonna cry another night, no
You're gonna miss this chick right here
You're gonna miss this chick, I swear---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
