Uh Uh when you hear it knockin like that 
Yall know what this is 

When my man leave the house 
I know hes coming right back 
I got that good good 
I got that good good 
No matter how much he might try to act 
He know just where its at 
I got that good good (yup)

I put it on him right (uh)
I do it every night (uh)
I leave him sittin 
Mouth open 
Like, Whoa! 
So I dont worry bout (uh)

Cause I know just the right thang to do 
I got that good good 

I never had a problem with the one 
Never been worry about him ever cheating on me 
Cause when I say I got that pop lock and drop it 
Believe me 
If Im with you Its gonna kill you 
On the days you dont see me 
See The things I possess a lot of women dont (dont) 
And the things Imma do for my most wont (wont) 
I hear em talking bout it when Im up on the salon 
Crying cause they man aint come home

Ladies dont believe half what you hear 
Cause its all a waste of time 
If you know you got that good good good 
Everything will be just fine 
So let your man be the man when he in public 
Even though behind the scenes yall be runnin 
Let him run with his boys 
Let him play his little games 
Let him drive his Cadillac 
Dont worry hell be back 

When my man leave the house
