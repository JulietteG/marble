All I heard was the sound of fish who'd drowned. All I saw was the inside of my eyelids. All I said fell short of reaching open ears.Words floating, clouding the view...'See no, hear no, speak no evil' leaves you deaf, dumb and blind, because the bad is all you'll find. A deeply heart-felt goodbye to the part of me that died when I decided to put others before me, yes, my heart fell asleep - boredom and fatigue.I always said I wanted to die smiling, To pretend I'm at peace. Now from my corpse beams a frigid, blank grin and once hopeful eyes are sunken in. Like a lullaby to the cradle is the eulogy to the casket. All my flaws swept under the table to grieve the porcelain doll that was me.Their solemn songs sang me to sleep as my body escaped me. Welcome down into the New World! Happiness is being interred! Such a shameful masquerade! Fleeting, frozen minutes on display. Why is evolution such a shameful thing to say? Can you fee! your bodily decay? Arms are beside me, hands open wide.
Seems I was living mv life in rewind, taking so manv steps backwards, not looking behind.
Because I can sure as hell feel my brain going blank. If my body betrays me, there's pollution
to thank. This condition infects my cells like it controls my mind. Internal army, defend me
behind enemy lines! Fragile vehicle of mine! Don't abandon me yet! There is so much to live
for that we so easily forget. Fascination with the fear... The concept escapes me.
All encompassing fate... how it wrenches our hearts, torments our souls and sings us all to sleep
to an eternal keep, no matter what beliefs, it sweetly sings us all...---Lyrics submitted by yanina.
