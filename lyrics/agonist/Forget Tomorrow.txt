Fall into flames
All that remains of me is a stepped
On, thrown out piece of your enemy. All that remains
Of me is about to hit the ground.

When you begin to deny all of your
Past lives... When you begin to deny that you can't
Defend your lies...

In total, In control
Yet thrown overboard get pulled below...
Wait patiently
As it sorrounds me. In vitro
Go home... go... set me free
The end is only a bloodloss, cointoss tragedy.
Blinded-eyed guilty plea.

So caught up in here and now. Walk on, walk
on. Lie expectancy goies down... corruption. The
Weakest mind will wear the crown because we all
Need protection. Escape is a dangerous art -
Addiction is the easy part. (Please don't let
Me fall into flames...)

Night falls and darkness rises deep inside
His skin. Blood, sweat and tears will soon pay
For this sin.

In total In control
Yet thrown overboard get pulled below...
Wait patiently
As it sorrounds me. Walks towards home, thinks
He's alone... Wait and you'll see - the frust
Glows in his eyes. Explanation is only a disguise
For Death's now enterprise. Infiltration...
Self-destruction.. Felt so lonely, what a
Tragedy---Lyrics submitted by Tomi.
