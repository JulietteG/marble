does history guide you or do you set out to change it?

breach not broken

fuck your skinned alive designer wear
fashion shades and salon hair
heels to help where nature failed
artificial teeth and nails

the wasps nest expands

so clap your hands
its her!
the one black woman who's succes you dont credit to affirmative action
the way that the future is
corporate sponsers raising your kids
maternal love is nothing compared to what 7 dolars gives

put in suck out plastic body parts
its the ever growing industry of cosmetic arts
bombarded with idilioc shots
just morbid self destructive flaws

phisical flaws are a mental blank

so pay your sergions ats your parents who you should thank

these eyes are blind to several hundred left behind
(lest we forget again)
But the border is breached but not broken
who tries (who tries) to find the several hundres left behind
But the border is breached but not broken

co-existing in a twisted society
where youth is a crime
and wasteful sweatshop expanditures is how luxury is defined
now the KKK has found a new masquerade
fuck your self proclamed supremacy
you hide your face and your shame!

identify right and wrong when all fact is merely opinion
you cannot know the sweetness of victory without first dwelling in the agony of defeat

these eyes are blind to several hundred left behind
(lest we forget again)
But the border is breached but not broken
who tries (who tries) to find the several hundred left behind
but the border is breached the border is breached the...
(These eyes are blind)
the several hundred left behind we've forgot again...---Lyrics submitted by Garrett.
