Why are you striving these days?
Why are you trying to earn grace?
Why are you crying?
Let me lift up your face,
Just dont turn away.

Why are you looking for love?
Why are you still searching as if IM not enough?
To where will you go child?
Tell me, where will you run, 
To where will you run?

Cause Ill be by your side
Wherever you fall.
In the dead of night
Whenever you call.
And please dont fight these hands that are holding you.
My hands are holding you.

Look at these hands at my side.
They swallowed the grave on that night.
When I drank the worlds sin
So I could carry you in
And give you life.
I want to give you life.

And Ill be by your side
Wherever you fall.
In the dead of night
Whenever you call.
And please dont fight these hands that are holding you.
My hands are holding you.

Here at my side
Wherever you fall.
In the dead of night
Whenever you call.
And please dont fight these hands that are holding you.
My hands are holding you.

Cause I, I love you.
I want you to know
That I, I love you.
Ill never let you go, no, no.

And Ill be by your side
Wherever you fall.
In the dead of night
Whenever you call
And please dont fight these hands that are holding you.
My hands are holding you.

Here at my side.
Wherever you fall.
In the dead of night
Whenever you call
And please dont fight these hands that are holding you.
My hands are holding you.

Here at my side
My hands are holding you.---Lyrics submitted by Joshua.
