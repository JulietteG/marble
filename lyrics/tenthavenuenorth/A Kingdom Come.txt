How many tears will I have cried
Before you wipe them from my eyes
And how dark will this night become
Before the rising of the sun
And all the while,
You lead through the fire up to
Somewhere beyond my fear

And all I have is love and desire
That one day Youll appear

Your kingdom come
Your will be done
Let that be all I want
And as I wait to see Your face
Keep my head lifted up
To a kingdom come, come, come

How many troubles will I know
Before I see Your justice roll
Yeah, I admit my faith is weak
Lord, come and help my unbelief

Cause all I have is the hope and desire
That youll have mercy here

Your kingdom come
Your will be done
Let that be all I want
And as I wait to see Your face
Keep my head lifted up
To a kingdom come, come, come

I know Youre working
I know Youre moving here
Your grace, a river running
Underneath my fears
Let all my questions
And all my doubts collide
With the promise
You are making all things right

Your kingdom come
Your will be done
Let that be all I want
And as I wait to see Your face
Keep my head lifted up
Keep my head lifted up
To a kingdom come, come, come
To a kingdom come, come, come
Till Your kingdom come, come, comes ---
