I hear You calling out my name, Lord
But I cant look You in the eye
So I, I just stay away
I tried and tasted whats forbidden
And it filled me with delight
But now Im still hungry inside

Forgive me, forgive me, Lord
For living like Im not Yours
I forget how kind You are
You are light for my foolish heart
My heart, my heart, my heart
You are the light of my
My heart, my heart, my heart
You are the light of my

Oh, God, I let intruders into
The garden of my soul
Foxes are running wild
I thought You were holding out on me now
To keep me from being free
How could I have been so wrong

Like a runaway
Always running, running from the pain
Tried my own way to live
To steal what You already give
I gave up the truth for a lie
Trade the sun in for the moonlight
Oh, dont let me sleep here tonight
I want to see You here with new eyes
New eyes

Father, forgive me
I forget that I am Yours
No other Savior is as kind as You are
So kind to me, Lord
Youre mine, I am yours
Youre mine, Lord, and I'm yours
Youre mine, Lord, and I'm yours ---
