I need You, I love You, I want You
No one else can make me new
I need You, I love You, I want You
No one else can make me new

Your joy is better than wine
Its better than love
Its better than life
Your joy is where my heart sings
Its where I belong
Its where I believe

I will wait for only You
No one else can make me new
No one else can break the silence

I will wait for only You
My heart needs to hear whats true
No one else will break the silence

I will wait for only You
No one loves me like You do
No one else can break the silence

So I will wait for only You
No one else can pull me through
No one else will break the silence

No one else can make me new
No one else can make me new---
