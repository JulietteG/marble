Is this the spark where it begins
We find freedom from our sins
Is this the place I finally trust
Your presence is enough to
Speak light in my darkness
Speak light until I know
Theres strength for my weakness
Slow down, oh my soul

You are where my soul finds rest
You are where I lay my head
Your grace lets me catch my breath
Lets me fall into Your arms again

God, my life I shall not want
Lead me where Your waters run
You yourself and nothing less
All my life, Ill fight to rest
Speak light in my darkness
Speak light until I know
Theres strength for my weakness
Slow down, oh my soul
Slow down, my soul

Tell me Your love will never fail me
Im safe here in Your mercy
Youre keeping me alive

I need to feel Your peace within me
Calm the fears that haunt me
Clear away the lies

Tell me Your love is in my bloodstream
Its burning up my heartbeat
Bringing me Your light

Again
Again and again
Again and again---
