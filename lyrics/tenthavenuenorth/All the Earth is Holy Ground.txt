All the earth is holy ground
All the earth is holy ground
Every single breath
Every single sound
I can feel You with me now

All the earth is holy ground
All the earth is holy ground
I dont believe in secular things
Just a world waiting to be redeemed
I was lost but I was found
Now all the earth is holy ground

Wherever I go
I see light, I see Your light
Wherever I go
The sacreds inside of the sacred inside

Oh, what a mystery
Your life and breath alive inside of me
Unworthy to be Your son
But somehow You reached down
And made me Your home
Your mercy has remade
This house I burned down to the grave
Your spirit filled my lungs
Now wherever I go
I bring the kingdom come
Let my song resound
All the earth is holy ground
Holy ground
All the earth is holy ground
All the earth is holy ground

Wherever I go
I see light, I see Your light
Wherever I go
Theres sacred inside---
