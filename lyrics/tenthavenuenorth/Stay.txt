I have run through field and mountain
I have waited for the dawn
Gave you heart and soul and body
For the promise of your love

I will not let the fear take over
I will not heed the sirens song
I have seen miracles break like thunder
So I will wait til the feeling comes

Oh, my love, I will fight my heart to keep you safe here
All my life, I will stay
Stay
Oh, my love, we are a light, a mirror of love eternal
How could I walk away
Stay, stay, stay, stay

We can learn to choose each other
Face to face and hand in hand
Fire dies and tempest crashes
But we wont let the darkness in

Oh, love, I will stay here
Oh, love, come take my hand tonight
Can we remember what was revealed in the sunlight
For rich or poor, I wont leave your side
We can walk safely together through the battle lines

Oh, love, come take my hand tonight
Can we remember what was revealed in the sunlight---
