We were built by the hands of love
Redeemed in spite of what weve done
We are the spirits dwelling place
And now, children of the light
Fight back darkness with delight
Lift your eyes up to His face
Let joy take temptations place
Joy takes temptations place

Open up our souls to feel Your glory
Lord, we are a desperate people
Your cathedrals
God, fill this space
Let joy take temptations place
We will taste and see You as You are

Father, let Your kingdom come
Keep us from our lesser loves
Nothing else can satisfy
Like the joy found in Your eyes
Theres joy found inside Your eyes
Your eyes

May we see You as You are

And our hungry souls reach out to whatever fills us up
But well keep on falling down unless we fall in love
Our hungry souls reach out to whatever fills us up
But we keep on falling down until we fall in love

Lord, Lord, Lord---
