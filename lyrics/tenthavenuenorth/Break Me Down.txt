Yeah, I feel You falling'
Like the rain against my skin
And I hear You calling'
Your voice like thunder in my head
And now I am stalling'
'Cuz I'm afraid to let You in
Yeah, come break me down with Your mercy
Come break me down again

[Chorus:]
I'm Yours
Tonight
I'm Yours if you can break me down
Break through these wall I hide behind
I'm Yours
Tonight
Come and break me down
Won't You break me

Won't You break me down 
Na Na 
Breaking me down

I feel it inside me
I feel You underneath my skin
These walls could not hide me
They could not keep You from coming in
So now here You find me
Right back to where I began
Oh, come break me down with Your mercy
Come break me down again

(Chorus)

Break me down
Oh, oh
Come and break me down
'Cuz I need Your strength to feel this weak
I need Your touch to fill my need
I need Your strong hands to carry me
Take me, break me, set me free
I need Your strength to feel this weak
I need Your touch to fill my need
I need Your stong hands to carry me
Take me, bring me to my knees

I'm Yours
Tonight
I'm Yours if You can break me down
Break through these walls I hide behind
I'm Yours tonight
(Come and break me down) [x3]
Yeah, wont You break me down.---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
