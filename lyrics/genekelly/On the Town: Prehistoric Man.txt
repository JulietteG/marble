Modern man is not for me 
The movie star and dapper Dan
Give me the healthy Joe from ages ago
A prehistoric man
What has Gable got for me? 
Or Mrs Johnson's blond boy band? 
I want a happy ape with no English drape
A prehistoric man
Top hats, bow ties
He simply wore no ties
Bare skin, bare skin
He just sat around in nothing but bare skin
I really love bare skin. 
Some guys care a lot for me
But my excitement they can't ban
Because I still await my primitive mate
We've had a date since the world began 
My prehistoric man
No psychoanalysis
He never knew what made him tick
He never paid, it seems, for telling his dreams 
Poor prehistoric Dick
Jitters, jitters
He never had jitters
No repression
He just believed in free self expression
I love self expression
He had honest calices 
He never worked to pile up dough
So unlike you and me, no ulcers had he
Simple and free
In the long ago
For prehistoric Joe
Bebop, be op, 
They didn't have bebop
Tom-toms, tom-toms
They sat all day just a beatin' on tom-toms
I really love tom-toms---Lyrics submitted by Ho Chi Cosgood.
