Now you're a clone,
With heart of stone,
Synthetic soul,
Brainwashed and cold.
You're just a drone,
Got no control,
Forced in a mold,
Processed and sold.

Hey, you know I find it frightening,
How you change just as fast as lightning.

You fell from grace,
Leaving no trace,
You've been replaced,
Your name erased.

Hey, it's your self-destruction,
You never listened to my instruction.

Shame, shame, shame, shame.

Shame, that everyone's the same.
I thought you stood alone,
Different from the clones.

You were a flash of light,
A meteorite,
Unique in time,
Now out of sight.
For I have seen,
What could've been,
I've had a dream,
A prophecy.

Hey, now there's no use waiting,
Everything is disintegrating.

Shame, that everyone's the same.
I thought you stood alone,
Were different from the clones.
I thought you were the true
Exception to the rules.
But the truth is cruel.

Clones, clones, clones, clones.

Clones, clones, clones, clones.

Hey, now there's no use waiting,
Everything is disintegrating.

Shame, that everyone's the same.
I thought you stood alone.
Different from the clones.
I thought you were the true
Exception to the rules.
But the truth is cruel.---Lyrics submitted by lo.
