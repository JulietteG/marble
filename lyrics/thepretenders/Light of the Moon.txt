Take a message to my love
 And don't say where you saw me
 Seven men crossed the river
 And they took all the money

Colour the wind
 And search deep within
 And by the light of the moon
 Light of the moon
 Light of the moon
 We'll begin again

Secrets whispered in shadows
 While the village lay sleeping
 Guiding me to the answer
 Bang a drum and I'll follow

Colour the wind
 And search deep within
 And by the light of the moon
 Light of the moon
 Light of the moon
 We'll begin again

Say they're taking the children
 Oh, I think they've forgotten
 Does their innocence wander
 On it's way back to my love

Colour the wind
 And search deep within
 And by the light of the moon
 Light of the moon
 Light of the moon
 We'll begin again---Lyrics submitted by Randy Fabricant.
