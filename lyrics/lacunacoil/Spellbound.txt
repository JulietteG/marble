Burning here in my room
Feeling that
The walls are moving closer
Sight and seen
The dark takes me
Leads me to
The ending of another day
Im haunted 

Tell me who you are
I am spellbound
You cannot have this control of me
Everywhere I go
I am spellbound
I will break the spell you put on me

Velvet drapes, glowing candles
Silent whispers
Of words inside of my head
The nighttime comes
It waits for me
Leads me to
The ending of another day
Im haunted

Tell me who you are
I am spellbound
You cannot have this control of me
Everywhere I go
I am spellbound
I will break the spell you put on me
(Break the spell)

Tell me who you are
I am spellbound
You cannot have this control of me
Everywhere I go
I am spellbound
I will break the spell you put on me

Everywhere I go
I am spellbound
Everywhere I go
I am spellbound
Everywhere I go
I am spellbound
I will break the spell you put on me---Lyrics submitted by Maria.
