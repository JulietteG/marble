Hear what I say
I'm gonna get out of my mind where I'm going to
Be on your way your spirit is crawling after
Will I disappear?

Everything dies nothing to worry about
Everything goes on goes on goes on

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape there's nothing more I can do
I just don't know why do I need you?

See what I see
I'm gonna get out of my mind where I'm going to
...no more no more
I'm ready to go serene to find
there's nothing to hold to reach you

Everything dies nothing to worry about
Everything goes on goes on goes on

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape there's nothing more I can do
I just don't know why do I need you?

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape there's nothing more I can do
I just don't know why do I need you?---Lyrics submitted by Monika.
