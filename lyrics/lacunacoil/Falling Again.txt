I lay, look in my hands
Searching these lines
I have not the answer
I'm crying and I don't know
Watching the sky
I search an answer
I'm free, free to be
I'm not another liar
I just want to be myself... myself

And now the beat inside me
Is a sort of a cold breeze
And I've never any feeling inside
Ruining me...
I bring my body
Carry it into another world
I know I live...
But like a stone i'm falling down

I pray looking to the sky
I can feel this rain
Right now it's fallin' on me
Fly, I just want to fly
Life is all mine
Some days I cry alone
But I know I'm not the only one
I'm here another day is gone
I don't want to die
Please be there when i'll arrive...
Don't cry please 

And now the beat inside me
Is a sort of a cold breeze
And I've never any feeling inside
You're ruining me...
I bring my body
Carry it into another world
I know I live...
But like a stone i'm falling down

And now the beat inside me
Is a sort of a cold breeze
And I've never any feeling inside
You're ruining me...
I bring my body
Carry it into another world
I know I live...
But like a stone i'm falling down---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
