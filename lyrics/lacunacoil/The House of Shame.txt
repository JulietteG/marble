Run!
Rise!

Burn me reducing the stigma
Born to live in this house of shame
While I dig the grave on my path to find faith
You weren't there while I was dying
You're the reason I'm feeling so deranged
I will stay here and haunt you forever

Why always staring into the light?
If I don't hide inside the darkness
You'll be compromised, but sometimes
You will fly with me again without falling,
without falling

Rise!
Read my words!
Run!
Mark my words!

I'm bedridden here locked outside of my faith
Incurable captured by time
You're the reason I'm feeling so deranged
I will stay here and haunt you forever

Why always staring into the light?
If I don't hide inside the darkness
You'll be compromised,
But sometimes
You will fly with me again
without falling, without falling

I told you to leave me alone
I told you to leave me alone
I told you to leave me alone
I told you to leave me alone!

Take my soul!

Sometimes
You will find me there again
without mourning, without mourning

Sometimes
You will fly with me again
without falling, without falling

Rise!
Read my words!
Run!
Mark my words!---
