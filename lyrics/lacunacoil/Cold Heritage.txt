Don't tell me why
I'm so near to commit a crime
When I say "Oh I'm here in front of you"
I'm here
Illusion falls when you're not honest about the way I feel
And now I need only your voice

Saving all my words only for you
And forgive me
And forgive me
Saving all my words only for you
And forgive me
And forgive me

I don't know why
There's a limit to defy
With a vision of a future at my feet
I'm here
Do not embrace me while the picture simply blows me away
I feel I need only your voice

And I'm only here inside of me
Deep inside of me
Believe in the light in me
And I'm only here inside of me
Deep inside of me
Reveal delight in me

Saving all my words only for you
And forgive me
And forgive me
Saving all my words only for you
And forgive me
And forgive me

Don't tell me why
I'm so near to commit a crime
When I say "Oh I'm here in front of you"
I'm here
Illusions falls when you're not honest about the way I feel
And now I need only your voice

And I'm only here inside of me
Deep inside of me
Believe in the light in me
And I'm only here inside of me
Deep inside of me
Reveal delight in me

And I'm only here inside of me
Deep inside of me
I've never never felt myself this way before
I don't want to leave you with my tears
If you disappear
Believe in the light in me

Saving all my words only for you
And forgive me
And forgive me
Saving all my words only for you
And forgive me
And forgive me

Falling on my knees only for you
And forgive me
And forgive me
Saving all my words only for you
And forgive me
And forgive me---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
