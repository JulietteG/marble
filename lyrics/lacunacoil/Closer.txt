Want to get closer, in too deep
Where there is something I wish for I'll go through
Want to get closer into you
No hell to discover
I've got it all inside myself
Salvation you have preached is gone
No way, you can't turn it around

Looking for a higher ground
Searching for this something missed before
From a higher ground
Will I fall in a right direction?
(Higher, searching for more)

Falling apart
There's nothing real
That will convince me to change but I'll go through
Want to get closer into you
No hell to discover
There is just nothing to betray
Salvation you have preached is gone
No way, you can't turn it around

Looking for a higher ground
Searching for this something missed before
From a higher ground
Will I fall in a right direction?
(Higher, searching for more)

Looking for a higher ground
Searching for this something missed before
From a higher ground
Will I fall in a right direction?
(Higher, searching for more)

Looking for a higher ground
Searching for this something missed before
From a higher ground
Will I fall in a right direction?
(Higher, searching for more)

Looking for a higher ground
Searching for this something missed before
From a higher ground
Will I fall in a right direction?
