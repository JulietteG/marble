Something about you that makes me feel bad
I wasnt there when a thin line destroyed your soul
I search every corner
Theres nowhere to hide
How I feel ignorance
Sacrifice some days its harder
Lets face it, its all about me
Deeply into your own

Deep within me
Lifes crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone and I know there will be another way
Im leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye

Something about you will make me stronger
Now Im aware when a man falls rebound, my fault
I search every corner
Just nowhere to hide
How I feel ignorance
Sacrifice some days its harder
Lets face it, its all about me
Deeply into your own

Deep within me
Lifes crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone and I know there will be another way
Im leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye

Here I wanna be
No more lies!

Deep within me
Lifes crawling and wasting my days
Another night gone and I know there will be another way
Im leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Sanja.
