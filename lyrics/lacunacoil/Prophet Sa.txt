Light of my sun 
Light in this temple 

Light in my truth 
Light into darkness 

Teasing pureness 
of your lies 
soreness of a 
delightful mission 
Burning up 
inside your mind 
you belong 
to my possessions 

Can't you see that 
I'm here inside you? 

Can't you see im here inside?

Light,  Massive pain 
Glide,  Passive tension 

Light,  Show me how to 
slide in this pleasure 

Teasing pureness 
of your eyes 
crawling into empty spaces 
You could lie and lie again 
you belong to my possession

Can't you see that 
I'm here inside you? 

Can't You see that 
i'm here inside?

Can't you see that
i'm here inside you?

Can't you see that
 im here inside?

This is my harmony 
I'm in your heart again 
This is the place to live 
where I'm alone again 

This is my harmony - I'm here 
I lay again - This is the prayer to give 
I'm all alone again---Lyrics submitted by Dylan.
