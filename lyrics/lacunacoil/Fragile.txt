What? Damn, you're right!
Dare is about obsession
It's something inside
Wounds are bleeding in my hands
Turning blind
No one will ever stop this self-made decline
Nothing really matters.

He's watching me
What if I look away and deal with it (He's watching me)
Digging in my grave (He's watching me)
I won't deny it (He's watching me)
Fragile
My crystal ball (He's watching me)
Shattered on the ground

What? Damn, you're right!
Learn is about rejection
There's nothing to hide
Wounds are healing in my hands
Turning blind
No one will ever scratch
My own state of mind
Nothing really matters

He's watching me
What if I look away and deal with it (He's watching me)
Digging in my grave (He's watching me)
I won't deny it (He's watching me)
Fragile
My crystal ball (He's watching me)
Shattered on the ground

He's watching me
What if I look away and deal with it (He's watching me)
Digging in my grave (He's watching me)
I won't deny it (He's watching me)
Fragile
My crystal ball (He's watching me)
Shattered on the ground---Lyrics submitted by Matty.
