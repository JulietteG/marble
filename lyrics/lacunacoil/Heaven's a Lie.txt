Oh no,
here it is again
I need to know
when I will fall into decay

Something wrong
with every plan of my life
I didn't really notice that you've been here

Dolefully desired
Destiny of a lie

Set me free
your heaven's a lie
set me free with your love
set me free

(repeat 1x)

Oh no,
here it is again
I need to know
why did I choose to betray you

Something wrong
with all the plans of my life
I didn't realize that you've been here

Dolefully desired
Destiny of a lie

Set me free
your heaven's a lie
set me free with your love
set me free

Set me free your heaven's a lie
set me free with your love
set me free

Dolefully desired

Set me free 
your heaven's a lie
set me free with your love
set me free 

(repeat 3x)---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
