Pictures on the bedroom wall
Casting engines till you fall
all the lies I cant ignore
I've heard this all before
and I never did say goodbye
all the times I made you cry
everything said you're all alone left without a soul

I gave my life, you stole what's mine, this last goodbye
tear my pictures off your wall 
you don't deserve me looking at you anymore
I let dying, draped from trying!
Left with my heart beating on the floor

and I look at your face with sad
your kissing sad it drove me mad
on hands and knees you dont deserve me looking at you anymore

I gave my life, you stole what's mine this last goodbye
tear my pictures off your wall 
you don't deserve me looking at you anymore
I let dying, draped from trying!
Left with my heart beating on the floor

Your class was always having tea. 
Turn and always having me.
In the end you can't let go.

tear my pictures off your wall 
you don't deserve me looking at you anymore
I let dying, draped from trying!
Left with my heart beating on the floor

My life never tried to, what's mine left behind you.
Tear those tainted pictures off your wall. x2---Lyrics submitted by katelynn.
