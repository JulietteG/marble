If we forget God, our nation is doomed.

The stories, and pictures, in most magazines.
Now feature new styling, unfit to be seen.                                                      
They're placed on the newsstand, where children can buy.                                                                                                                                               
When they go wrong, do we wonder why.                                                           

If we forget God, His mercy will flee.                                                                           
And sin will cover, the land and the sea.                                                                        
If we forget God, satin will rule.                                                                                      
If we forget God, our nation is doomed.

(music)

So many are climbing, fames golden hill.                                                   
By singing of evil, that gives this world a thrill.                                                         
But I'll sing of Jesus, and tho they won't hear.                                   
God will bless me, for doing His will.

If we forget God, His mercy will flee.                                                                            
And sin will cover, the land and the sea.                                                                        
If we forget God, satin will rule.                                                                                       
If we forget God, our nation is doomed.
