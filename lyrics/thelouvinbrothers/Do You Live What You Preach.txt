Many prophets are here as a witness for God
Many churches they now represent
and if you've been redeemed
you'll know them whom God sent
for we know by their fruits whom they serve

(chorus)
Do you live what you preach?
Would you preach what you live?
In the presence of God could you stand?
Jesus knows every deed
good or bad from your birth
Do you live what you preach in your church?

Some may stand in their church and proclaim they love God
and may win earthly fame in their speech
if they love not their brother in deed and in truth
the right hand of God they'll never reach

(chorus)
Do you live what you preach?
Would you preach what you live?
In the presence of God could you stand?
Jesus knows every deed
good or bad from your birth
Do you live what you preach in your church?

If your heart don't go out in the service of God
then you're lost with the sinners on earth
if you have no desire to be honest with God
you don't live what you preach in your church

(chorus)
Do you live what you preach?
Would you preach what you live?
In the presence of God could you stand?
Jesus knows every deed
good or bad from your birth
Do you live what you preach in your church? ---
