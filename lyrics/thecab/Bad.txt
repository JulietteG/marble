It feels just like it was yesterday
 We were in love, why's it falling apart
 I've never been one to walk away
 But I've had enough and it's breaking my heart

Cause you love me just the way that you should
 It's nothing that you do, no it's nothing you say
 Yeah baby, I know that you're good
 But I don't want a good girl no, not today

Cause I want it bad, I want a bad girl, baby, bad
 I want a love that's crazy, yeah
 I want a bad girl, baby, bad, I want it bad

I want a girl who stays out too late
 And when I call, she doesn't answer the phone
 Oh, I want a girl who likes it her way
 And through it all, I know I'll end up alone

Yeah yeah, you love me just the way that you should
 It's nothing that you do, no no, it's nothing you say
 Oh pretty baby, I know that you're good
 But I don't want a good girl, no not today, mmm

Cause I want it bad I want a bad girl, baby, bad
 I want a love that's crazy, yeah
 I wanna fight, I wanna rock and roll and party all night
 Yeah, I want it bad, I want a bad girl, baby, bad, I want it bad

I'm getting sick of predictable, tired of acting logical
 Oh yeah, I gotta shake it up tonight
 Yeah girl I want something physical
 Not something invisible, oh yeah
 I'm tired of being good, let's be bad

I want a bad girl baby, bad
 And I want a love that's crazy, yeah
 I want a bad girl, baby, bad
 I want a love that's crazy, yeah
 I wanna fight, I wanna rock and roll and party all night
 Yeah, I want it bad, I want a bad girl, baby, bad
 I want a love that's crazy, yeah
 I wanna fight, I wanna rock and roll and party all night
 Yeah, I want it bad---Lyrics submitted by Trish King.
