baby, take it off
checkered thighs on a pretty pawn
this vicious velvet ain't enough
so baby, make a move
my neon eyes are set on you
the devil's language, taste of lust

tell me what can i say to make your body come this way
we're only two in a crowded room where others fade away
it's only a crime if i get caught (only if i, if i get caught)
it's only a line if it gets bought

i woke up 12:05, i left that room with no goodbye
and now i'm on my way back home
it's not that your lipstick failed
but girl i was just born to bail
i do it better on my own

tell me what can i say to make your body come this way
we're only two in a crowded room where others fade away 
its only a crime if i get caught (only if i, get caught)
its only a line if it gets bought

it's the same game i play 'till the give becomes the take (what can i say, what can i say)
it's the same game i play 'till the bend-the bend becomes the break

baby, take it off
checkered thighs on a pretty pawn
this vicious velvet ain't enough
so baby, make a move
my neon eyes are set on you
the devil's language, taste of lust

(Guitar break)

It's only a line if it gets bought

Its the same game i play 'till the give becomes the take(what can i say, what can i say)
Its the same game i play 'till the give becomes the take(Why can't you come this way)
Its the same game i play 'till the give becomes the take(what can i say, what can i say)
its the same game i play 'till the bend-the bend becomes the break---Lyrics submitted by Alicia.
