(I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun,
 An angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun..)

Get out your guns, battles begun,
 are you a saint, or a sinner?
 If loves a fight, than I shall die,
 with my heart on a trigger.

They say before you start a war,
 you better know what you're fighting for.
 Well baby, you are all that I adore,
 if love is what you need, a soldier I will be.

I'm an angel with a shotgun,
 fighting til' the wars won,
 I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
 I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
 Don't you know you're everything I have?
 ..and I, wanna live, not just survive, tonight.

Sometimes to win, you've got to sin,
 don't mean I'm not a believer.
 ..and major Tom, will sing along.
 Yeah, they still say I'm a dreamer.

They say before you start a war,
 you better know what you're fighting for.
 Well baby, you are all that I adore,
 if love is what you need, a soldier I will be.

I'm an angel with a shotgun,
 fighting til' the wars won,
 I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
 I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
 Don't you know you're everything I have?
 ..and I, wanna live, not just survive, tonight.

ooooohhhhhhhh, ooooooohhhhh whoa whoa oooh whoa

I'm an angel with a shotgun..
 fighting til' the wars won..
 I don't care if heaven won't take me back..

I'm an angel with a shotgun,
 fighting til' the wars won,
 I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
 I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
 Don't you know you're everything I have?
 (I'm an angel with a shotgun)
 ..and I, want to live, not just survive, tonight.
 (Live, not just survive)

..and I'm gonna hide, hide, hide my wings tonight.

They say before you start a war,
 you better know what you're fighting for.
 Well baby, you are all that I adore,
 if love is what you need, a soldier I will be.---Lyrics submitted by Charliiee.
