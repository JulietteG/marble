And I'm up,down
I'm spinning around 
High and dry and kicked to the ground 
I'm lost and I'll never be found

My lips were much to shy
The lines about you,they never rhymed
You said i never get things right
(i never said i was the best for you)

[Chours]
And baby,where'd you go?
i need you here to night
Singing myself to sleep
And your still my favorite melody
It's been three weeks 
How long can this go on?
Singing myself to sleep
And your haunting every memory
Get out,
good bye
Get out of my life
Goodnight

And your hot,cold
Your better in my bones
You run while i lose control
I miss you 
Forever you'll stay gold

And you know 
I'm not getting by
I've lost it,your in my mind
And everyday's the darkest of my life

[Chorus]
And baby where'd you go?
i need you here tonight
Singing myself to sleep
And your still my favorite melody
It's been three weeks
How long can this go on?
Singing myself to sleep
And your haunting every memory
Get out,
Goodbye
Get out of my life
Goodnight

'Cause I'm drowning when I close my eyes
And I'm falling; Ican't breathe tonight
End of story, I fade to black inside


Singing myself to sleep
And your still my favorite melody
It's been three weeks
How long can this go on?
Singing myself to sleep
And your haunting evert memory
Get out
Goodbye
Get out of my life
Goodnight

'Cause I'm drowning when i close my eyes
And I'm falling; I can't breathe tonight
End of story, i fade to black inside---Lyrics submitted by destiny.
