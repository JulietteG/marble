Come feel my heart it's beating like a drum and I confess
When you're around it's like an army's marching through my chest
And there's nothing I can do
I just gravitate towards you
You're pulling on me like the moon
I just wanna get you side ways
I'll say anything I can
To get me more than just a dance
Tell me where to put my hands
You know that you could be my favorite one- night stand
You get me higher

What would you do if I told you that I la la la la loved you?
Do if I said it tonight? 
What would you do if I told you that I la la la la loved you?
Cause you know I la la la lie...ooh!

You're like a song a beautiful symphony to my eyes
So take me on I wanna sing along all through the night
I'm not like the other boys cause  with you I've got no choice
You make me wanna lose my voice
I just wanna get you sideways
No I'm not the type to lie
But I might just start tonight
Let me turn off all these lights
You know that you could be my favorite lullaby
You get me higher

What would you do if I told you that I la la la la loved you?
Do if I said it tonight? 
What would you do if I told you that I la la la la loved you?
Cause you know I la la la lie...

Like a symphony, like a symphony, like a symphony tonight
Like a symphony , like a symphony , like a symphony tonight
Like a symphony, like a symphony, like a symphony tonight
Like a symphony, like a symphomy, like a symphony tonight

What would you do if I told you that I la la la la loved you?
Do if I said it tonight? 
What would you do if I told you that I la la la la loved you?
Cause you know I la la la la la ooh!
What would you do if I told you that I la la la la loved you?
Do if I said it tonight? 
What would you do if I told you that I la la la la loved you?
Cause you know I la la la lie...ooh!---Lyrics submitted by Sapphire LynZ.
