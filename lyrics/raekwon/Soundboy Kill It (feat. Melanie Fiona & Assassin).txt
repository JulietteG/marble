Settle in this real till my gold club come up
You ain't even know nothing, last week all on the street
Yelling let me hold something
Now shorty throw your booty up, use it in the cash
Keep it above, we and Louis something

My style, my flight, my weather
Yeah, I drive high plus fly, you a double
Me and Ciroc with a kettle
Throwing cream at shorty, love it, he a rebel

Watch the sun
Ciroc with a kettle, that's why we here
Watch the sun
I see so many scars here
I'm gonna find another way
'Cause we grinding, hurting
Scream like we tore up in two
And the sea about to fall
And the sea about to fall

Hey yo, out of the slums to hell
When the get thrown in a cell
I'm like a whale and anything other, then I'm a sell
Black, I'm going to jail
I was alright chilling, shorty came by
Let me all night filling I'm an alright villain
Keep a pocket knife, if I got a brawl, I'm willing
Be yelling, you about the light, ball right fellows
It was real, couldn't stop this all night chilling
Step out, it's money up at night, all villain
First round you down, sit down, clown killer
I'm rad just to put you down my nigga
Roll block villa, catch to blow hells in the Soho hotels
Getting swell, my niggas, this is the first White Cell, my niggas
And that's why I'm eating pretty well, my nigga

Watch the sun
Ciroc with a kettle, that's why we here
Watch the sun
I see so many scars here
I'm gonna find another way
'Cause we grinding, hurting
Scream like we tore up in two
And the sea about to fall
And the sea about to fall---
