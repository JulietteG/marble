Baby you got the body like a Benz
Im just tryna drive it once again
Baby you got the body like a Benz
Im just tryna drive it once again

Shawty can I be your tank, yeah
I start of with that What you drinking?
Pardon if Im road raging
But I know you heard my driver is crazy
Yeah, let me pace that, with some patience
Let me do it til I fill every void
Youre like a Maybach, thinking damn
They aint even make em like you no more
Its like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)
I can door you up, baby suicide
A little wordplay, Im hoping I can make you smile
Least until Im out of line like a DUI
Girl you remind me of my Jeep
Can I see whats up with that G-Wagon
Can I take you off of these streets
To the side of me, Im tryna see your hazards
Tryna be with the baddest, wont be the fastest
Gotta make it last, I hope you comfortable
I need to get to you, youre like a 62
A little work, then its curtains when Im skrrtin through
Came through in the brw, tryna leave in the coupe
That mean I gots a few, but I believe in you
Tryna chase the cat, know Im killin the dog
You aint feeling me naw, that mean I dont need the roof

You remind me of my Jeep, I wanna ride it
Youre something like my car
I got the keys to them, I need the keys to you

You put on a show, you dont need no clothes
Give me little bit more, always take it slow
I know you dont wanna stop, Im tryna make it go
Now speed it up like a Maserati, and look at me and pose

Baby you got the body like a Benz
Im just tryna drive it once again
Baby you got the body like a Benz
Im just tryna drive it once again

A good woman is scarce to us
And I wasnt prepared to love
I know I sound crazy, but your miles scare me
Im just here cause your character good (truth be told)
A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)
You heard it all but hear this love
One night with dude, I be the reason you 
So let me know am I clear enough, yeah, whats up?
Way I, way I, thats the way I think
Shawty straight like, a concert on  street
In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride Im like
Tight, lets keep it AMG
Slidin down, precipitating the street
Top down, let me kiss your physique
Im diggin your flee, Im checkin your gear
Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet
She like when I drive it, I like it in park
Pull that thing over you likely to sore
I got her floating like riding on stars
So I keep it GPS, see where this going
Nothing will stop it, I slide in no problem
Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts
Sections her weapon, my snake in her garden
So know when Im not here to bite, but its on

You put on a show, you dont need no clothes
Give me little bit more, always take it slow
I know you dont wanna stop, Im tryna make it go
Now speed it up like a Maserati, and look at me and pose

Baby you got the body like a Benz
Im just tryna drive it once again
Baby you got the body like a Benz
Im just tryna drive it once again---
