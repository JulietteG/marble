[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)
She live her whole life like tv
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)

[Verse 1]
Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go
Part-time waitress she really wanna make it
In the "City of Lights", it's hard to see clear
She don't really care about anyone advice
Nothing here's real, and everyone's alike
Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire's life
She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light
Indulging a meal when a toilets in sight
Expose those fries, can't hold those down
To be seven pounds, you must release several pounds
This is Heaven on Hell
This is how she wanna live
She ain't really trippin', she's on Beverly Hills

[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)
She live her whole life like tv
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)

[Verse 2]
Just another day out in Beverly Hills
She sing, model, and dance, but can't sit still
Believing the screens or anything there
But reality shows ain't real
So pretentious with no potential
She goes to catch up, although her rents up
In her defense-she part of the crowd
She gonna borrow some money
So she can party at Chows
It's apart of her goal
It's all she knows
Graduated from rosay, addicted to blow
Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow
So she kisses the stars
And gives them a blow
After every show, a dream she hold
Inhibition is gone, she just wanna be known
She wanna be know, she just wanna be known
Pulling down her skirt
"I never done this before", Nah

[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)
She live her whole life like tv
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)

[Verse 3]
You know big-breast girls
Never ever pay rent
They meet the Rich Boys
Throw D's on that Bitch
Lease on The Whip
Beach on the weekend
Hotel suite, room keys is a gift
Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger
Now you just a whore to the male entertainers
Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick
The sun's always out
But It's clouds over here
Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction
To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims
Hold on you can see my vision
Next to you let down on a nigga

[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom wit a nose bleed
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)
She live her whole life like tv
And she do anything for everything
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210) ---Lyrics submitted by Blake Seidl.
