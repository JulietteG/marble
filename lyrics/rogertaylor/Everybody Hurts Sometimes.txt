Everybody hurts sometime - you know it
(You know it)
And everybody loves sometime - don't be afraid to show it
If you don't get a little hurt sometime
If you don't dig a little dirt sometime
You ain't living at all

Love and affection - is the sweetest thing
But when love turns sour - it ain't a sin
It's a bitter pill but it turns to bitter - sweet - within
And it's on any street - everybody hurts
Sometime

Happiness is a young mans dream
But it don't come easy - know what I mean?
Gotta chase it down the street
Right to the last scene
Run down that illusion
Try to live your dream

Cos everybody hurts sometime - you know it
And everybody loves sometime - don't be afraid to show it
And if you don't get a little hurt sometimes
If you don't dig a little dirt sometimes
You ain't living at all ---Lyrics submitted by sean vincent.
