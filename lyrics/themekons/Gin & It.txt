Experts say she carried it upstairs 
To take what people said 
It used to live in a windmill
It used to behave
Crows gathered and dust fell in their hair 
Feet fell through the roof 
It coughed and moved downstairs quietly and unseen 
Down the drive into the avenue 
To Needle Park at noon 
Fathers draw their children closer to their sides 
It's too cold for June 
Belly to belly, back to back dancing, dancing round the square 
Belly to belly, back to back dancing, dancing round the square 
The waitress dropped her tray 
It just hurried on its way 
Past the storefronts in the shadow of the gates 
Where the naked neon women play 
Skirting round the running water 
This will be the shortest night of all 
And we wont sleep, we wont sleep at all
Dancing, dancing round the square
Me and all the other insolents dancing, dancing round the square 
Belly to belly, back to back dancing, dancing round the square 
Belly to belly, back to back dancing, dancing round the square 
Belly to belly, back to back dancing, dancing round the square 
Belly to belly, back to back dancing, dancing round the square---Lyrics submitted by Charlie Cattell.
