You make me this, bring me up, bring me down, playing sweet
Make me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat.
He makes me this, brings me up, brings me down, dancing sweet
Makes me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat.
You make me this, bring me up, bring me down, playing sweet
Make me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat.
He makes me this, brings me up, brings me down, dancing sweet
Makes me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat.

Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah...
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah...
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah...
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah...

Saxobeat, Saxobeat.
Hey, sexy boy, set me free, don't be so shy, play with me
My dirty boy, can't you see that you belong next to me.
Hey, sexy boy, set me free, don't be so shy, play with me
My dirty boy, can't you see, you are the one I need.

You make me this, bring me up, bring me down, playing sweet
Make me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat.
He makes me this, brings me up, brings me down, dancing sweet
Makes me move like a freak.

Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah...
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah...
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah...
Oh, yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah, mmm yeah...

You make me this, bring me up, bring me down, playing sweet
Make me move like a freak, Mr. Saxobeat.
He makes me this, brings me up, brings me down, dancing sweet
Makes me move like a freak.
You make me this, bring me up, bring me down, Saxobeat.
You make me this, bring me up, bring me down, Saxobeat.---Lyrics submitted by sophy.
