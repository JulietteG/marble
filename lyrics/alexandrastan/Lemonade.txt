Everything is so good in the summer air
Just put behind you all the problems that we share
Look into the sun, youll see me and you
Cause now you have the perfect view

Im so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see
Youre the only one for me

Im so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see
Youre the only one for me

Sunny, happy with the music no money
Im thinking youre on holiday
Sipping your lemonade

Sunny, happy with the music no money
Im thinking youre on holiday
Sipping your lemonade

Kept my promise and were laying on the beach
Now we have each other and it feels so rich
Look into the sun, youll see me and you
Cause now you have the perfect view

Im so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see
Youre the only one for me

Im so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
I just want you to see
Youre the only one for me

Sunny, happy with the music no money
Im thinking youre on holiday
Sipping your lemonade

Sunny, happy with the music no money
Im thinking youre on holiday
Sipping your lemonade

[Beat break]

So alone
Youre the only one for me
Im so alone
And now I really wanna make you come along
Youre the only one for me

Sunny, happy with the music no money
Im thinking youre on holiday
Sipping your lemonade

Sunny, happy with the music no money
Im thinking youre on holiday
Sipping your lemonade---
