I feel so good when I spend all my time with you
I feel so safe after all weve been going through
When Im looking in your eyes
I can see that you want me too
So go on, I feel so good when I spend all my time with you

When the night is gonna get to you
Were gonna scream my love, even dance forever
And Im gonna be in your groove
Im gonna dance with you until the night comes to an end

Hush hush, baby, dont you know, we are not a cliche
Hush hush, baby, dont you want us to sway the same way
Hush hush, baby, its been a wonderful day
And when the night comes near we gonna need a replay
Hush hush, baby, dont you know, we are not a cliche?

I feel so good, is gonna move me so close to you
I feel so safe I could go all the way with you
When the night is gonna get to you
Were gonna scream my love, even dance forever
And Im gonna be in your groove
Im gonna dance with you until the night comes to an end

Hush hush, baby, dont you know, we are not a cliche
Hush hush, baby, dont you want us to sway the same way
Hush hush, baby, its been a wonderful day
And when the night comes near we gonna need a replay
Hush hush, baby, dont you know, we are not a cliche?

Hush hush
Hush hush
Hush hush

Hush hush, baby, dont you know, we are not a cliche, cliche
Hush hush, baby, dont you want us to sway the same way
Hush hush, baby, its been a wonderful day
And when the night comes near we gonna need a replay
Hush hush, baby, dont you know, we are not a cliche---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
