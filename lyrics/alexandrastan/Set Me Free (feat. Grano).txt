Nothing you do will get to me, I'm telling you
All of the words you put before me, I tear them down
For all the times you looked into my eyes and told me lies
Now I'm moving on, singing this song
I'm leaving you!

Whatever you do to me,
You'll only SET ME FREE
Whatever you do to me,
You'll only SET ME FREE
Whatever you do to me,
You'll only SET ME FREE
Whatever you do to me,
You'll only SET ME FREE

[Instrumental]

Nothing you do will get to me, I'm telling you
For all the times you looked into my eyes and told me lies
Now I'm moving on, singing this song
I'm leaving you!

Whatever you do to me,
You'll only SET ME FREE
Whatever you do to me,
You'll only SET ME FREE
Whatever you do to me,
You'll only SET ME FREE
Whatever you do to me,
You'll only SET ME FREE

[Instrumental]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
