It was almost Christmas time
There I stood in another line 
Tryin to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood
Stadin' right in front of me
Was a little boy waitin' anxiously
Pacin' 'round like little boys do
And in his hands
He held a *pause* a pair of shoes
And his clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say...
"Sir I want to buy these shoes, for my momma please," 
"It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just here size"
"Could you hurry sir"
"Daddy says there's not much time"
"You see, shes been sick for quiet awhile"
"And I know these shoes will make her smile"
"And I want her to look beautiful, if momma meets Jesus tonight"
They counted pennies for what seem like years
and the cashier said, "Son theres not enough here."
He searched his pocket frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said, "Momma made Christmas good at our house"
"Though most years she just did without"
"Tell me sir what am I goin to do"
"Somehow I gotta buy these *pause* Christmas Shoes
So I layed the money down
I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face
When he said," Momma's goin to look so great"
Sir I wanna buy these shoes for my momma please
It Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry sir
Daddy says theres not much time
You see shes been sick for quiet awhile
And I know these shoes will make here smile
And I want her to look beautiful 
If momma meets Jesus tonight
I knew I caught a glimpse of heavens love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy to remind me
What Christmas is all about
"Sir I wanna buy these shoes for my momma please"
"Its Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size"
"Could you hurry sir"
"Daddy says theres not much time"
"You see shes been sick for quiet awhile"
"And I know these shows would make her smile"
"And I want her to look beautiful"
"If momma meets Jesus tonight"
"I want her to look beautiful"
"If momma meets Jesus tonight"---Lyrics submitted by Antonia.
