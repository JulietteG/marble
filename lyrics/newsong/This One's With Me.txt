I was dreaming about Heaven
Dreamed I was standing at the Pearly Gates
We're all there and I was so scared
In the presence of One so great

I felt so worried and worthy
I felt like running away
I bowed my head and I turn to go
When I heard someone say

"Father, this one's with me
Part of the family
One of the reasons I died on Calvary
Father, welcome him in
I paid the price for him
Father, oh Father, this one's with me"

I was dreaming about Heaven
When I looked up the gates were opened wide
And in the distance, I saw Jesus
Our eyes met and I began to cry

Angels robed in their beauty
Were there to show me the way
And all of Heaven singing
When I heard His voice say

"Father, this one's with me
Part of the family
One of the reasons I died on Calvary
Father, welcome him in
I paid the price for him
Father, oh Father"

Finally, we were there face to face
And He placed on me Heaven's crown
I fell down on my knees, laid my crown at His feet
Then He said to me

"Father, this one's with me
Part of the family
One of the reasons I died on Calvary
Father, welcome him in
I paid the price for him
Father, oh Father, this one's with me"---Lyrics submitted by peggie miles.
