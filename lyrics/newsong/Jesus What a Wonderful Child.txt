(feat. Anointed)

Jesus Jesus
Oh what a wonderful Child
Jesus Jesus
So lowly meek and mild
New life new hope new joy He brings
Won't you listen to the angels sing
Glory glory glory
To the newborn King
He was herald by the angel
Born in a lowly manger
The Virgin Mary was His mother
And Joseph was His earthly father
Three wise men came from afar
They were guided by a shining star
To see King Jesus where He lay
In a manger filled with hay
Glory to the newborn King
Glory to the newborn King
The angels sing
The Holy One
Heaven adores
The Son of God---Lyrics submitted by TORIE JACKSON.
