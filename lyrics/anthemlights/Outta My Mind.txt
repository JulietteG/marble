Feelin like I got a front row seat to watch everybody be happy
Cant even paint a smile on my face, its so hard to not complain
Gotta try not to say
O God, what about me
Cause I know thats not the way that Im supposed to be

Get me outta my mind and into Your heart
Its not about me, its not about me
So Im gonna start playin my part in Your design
Now is the time
Get me outta my mind
Outta my mind

There's a bigger picture on display and it's starting to come in focus
Causing me to see to see the ones in need outside my little world
Gotta try, just to say
O God, what can I do
Doesn't matter what it takes, I wanna lead them all to You

Get me outta my mind and into Your heart
Its not about me, its not about me
So Im gonna start playin my part in Your design
Now is the time
Get me outta my mind
Outta my mind

If anybody asks me what have I been up to
This is what I'm gonna say
I've been spending my time, outta my mind
And I'm really lovin livin this way
[x2]

Get me outta my mind and into Your heart
Its not about me, its not about me
So Im gonna start playin my part in Your design
Now is the time
Get me outta my mind
Get me outta my mind
So Im gonna start playin my part in Your design
Now is the time
Get me outta my mind
Outta my mind---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
