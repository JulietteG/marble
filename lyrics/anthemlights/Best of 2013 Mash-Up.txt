Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chilling
Smiling in the photo booth
But we got closer (yeah)
Soon you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon
And it's dark in a cold December,
but I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend ya and
keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on

Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know we aint friends anymore
If we walk down this road
Well be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like its do or die
And take me to the other side

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

I really want to love somebody
I really want to dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy
If our love's insanity why are you my clarity
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move (way you move)
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way (all the way)
I want you to stay (stay)
If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy (i want you to stay)
If our love's insanity why are you my clarity (i want you to stay)
I've got my ticket for the long way 'round
The one with the prettiest view
And I sure would like some sweet company
and I'm leaving tomorrow, whatdya say?

i need your love, if our love is tragedy... i really want to love somebody
i need your love (stay) if our love's insanity, i really want to love somebody

Na na na na na na na na eh eh eh eh
na na na na na na na na eh eh eh anthem ligths

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, well fight 'til its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
Like the ceiling cant hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, well fight 'til its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
Like the ceiling cant hold us---
