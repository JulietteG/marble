It's gotta be you, only you
It's got to be you, only you

I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can never be brave
You make my heart race

Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breath

Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you got that one thing

Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing

Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
You got that one thing

Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you got that one thing

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground
It ain't hard to tell, you don't know
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful

That's what makes you beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
I want it that way

Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
You got...

That's what makes you beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
