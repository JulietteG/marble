Tell me we don't have to leave, say we can stay forever
That we can always be just you and me together
Cause this moment is all that I want
Tell me how it used to be and let me make it better
Cause baby you and me will fly above the weather
Where we're going there's no holding on, no

Let my eyes be your sunrise here

Standing on top of the world
Hands up in the air, feeling so alive
Screaming at the top of our lungs
To the rhythm of our heartbeat beating tonight
(We go) ooh, standing on top of the world
(We go) ooh, standing on top of the world, top of the world

So this is what it feels like, living this life in color
Say bye to black and white, you let me change it over
Now I see there's no going back, no
Finally I understand what feeling's supposed to feel like
And when I got your hand, I've never been so high
All I need is all that you have

Your eyes are my sunrise here

Standing on top of the world
Hands up in the air, feeling so alive
Screaming at the top of our lungs
To the rhythm of our heartbeat beating tonight
(We go) ooh, standing on top of the world
(We go) ooh, standing on top of the world, top of the world

And from way up here our problems seem so small
So baby, have no fear, we'll fly above it all

Standing on top of the world
Hands up in the air, feeling so alive
Screaming at the top of our lungs
To the rhythm of our heartbeat beating tonight
(We go) ooh, standing on top of the world
(We go) ooh, standing on top of the world, top of the world---
