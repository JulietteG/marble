Somewhere between
Where I started and right now
You caught my eye
And all I can see now
Is the distance
Between you and I

In a land of settling
I can't seem to settle in

[chorus]
I am a stranger in this world, 
Just passing through
Waitin' on the son to come down
Waitin' on the son to come down,

I know that I will be on my
Way real soon
Waitin' on the son to come down
I won't be home 'till I'm with you
I won't be home 'till I'm with you, with you, with you

I don't belong,
I speak the language but still don't
Understand
What's going on,
So I'm running to you just as fast as I can

Don't want to settle in,
This place is not my home,

I am a stranger in this world, 
Just passing through
waitin' on the son to come down
Waitin' on the son to come down,

I know that I will be on my
way real soon
waitin' on the son to come down
I won't be home 'till I'm with you

Gotta keep my eyes
Looking to the skies
for you, the son is on his way
And I wanna be ready

And I won't forget,
That I'm not home 'till I'm with you
The son is on his way

I am a stranger in this world, 
Just passing through
Waitin' on the son to come down
Waitin' on the son to come down,

I know that I will be on my
Way real soon
Waitin' on the son to come down
I won't be home 'till I'm with you

I am a stranger in this world, 
Just passing through
Waitin' on the son to come down
Waitin' on the son to come down,

I know that I will be on my
Way real soon
Waitin' on the son to come down
I won't be home 'till I'm with you

(I am a stranger, a stranger)
I won't be home till I'm with you
(I am a stranger, a stranger)
I won't be home till I'm with you

(I am a stranger, a stranger)

(I am a stranger, a stranger)

(I am a stranger, a stranger)

(I am a stranger, a stranger)

(I am a stranger, a stranger)

(I am a stranger, a stranger)

(I am a stranger, a stranger)

(I am a stranger, a stranger)---Lyrics submitted by sarah bare.
