Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
I'm holdin' on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground.
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars.
And I'm hearin' what you say,
But I just can't make a sound.

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away.

And everyday I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold
I'm gonna give all my secrets

But, It's too late.
If I lose myself tonight
I can feel again.
It's too late.
If I lose myself tonight
I can feel again.

(Repeat x4)
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons are learnt

this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I Say, "Oh, got this feeling that you can't fight"
this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life, a good, good life
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, a good, good life,
Life For you, yeah, oh, a good, good life. ---Lyrics submitted by Angelo Feliciano.
