Just like philadelphia
Freedom means a lot to me
In between the place i've been
And where i'm going

I can see america
Trying not to show her age
Even though the winds of change
Keep on blowing

And i would lay your body down and rock your tears away
But it's much too late for now to be like yesterday
And the time is running out and we still have to say
Goodbye

Remember, philadelphia
When the world was young and warm
So in love and living for
Everything new

But i know, philidelphia
The winter wind will slowly take
Your heart and soul until it makes
Nothing of you

And i would lay your body down and rock your tears away
But it's much too late for now to be like yesterday
And the time is running out and we still have to say
Goodbye

Flash a peace sign take a bow
Though we may not know it now
Things are never gonna be the same

Here on seventh avenue
I tip my old top hat to you
I hope you find somebody who
Will love you like i do
'cause i would lay your body down and rock your tears away
But it's much too late for now to be like yesterday
And the time is running out and we still have to say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, philidelphia---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
