As you travel down the trail of life
Therell be dangers youll ?encounter?
Many rivers you will have to cross
In the ?laws? territory
Therell be mountains high and valleys low
But wherever you go

I wanna ride shotgun, be by your side
Down the road of life, come rain or shine
I wanna be someone whos always there by you
To protect your heart with a love thats true
Until the journeys done, I wanna ride shotgun

Therell be deserts you cant cross alone
Without someone there beside you
But together we can tame the West
?Raid the bad mens?, face the badness,
Cos I love you with a love too strong
To let you go all alone

I wanna ride shotgun, be by your side
Down the road of life, come rain or shine
I wanna be someone whos always there by you
To protect your heart with a love thats true
Until the journeys done, I wanna ride shotgun

I wanna ride shotgun, be by your side
Down the road of life, come rain or shine
I wanna be someone whos always there by you
To protect your heart with a love thats true
Until the journeys done, I wanna ride shotgun

I wanna ride shotgun, 
Raid the bad men
I wanna ride shotgun, 
Face the badness---Lyrics submitted by Gabor.
