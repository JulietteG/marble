What do I do,
now that I'm on my own?
What we did together
beats anything I've done alone

Since the day you left 
I've been askin' myself,
is this how its gonna be?
Without you what do I do with me?

I don't wanna go out,
but I just can't stay home.
I don't need company,
but I sure don't wanna be alone.

And to tell myself 
that I'm doin well
is only makin' believe
Without you what do I do with me?

Chorus

Without you where do I go?
where do I turn?
I'd sure like to know.
what do I do with all of our plans?
and how do I spend all this time on my hands?

I've tried everything,
I've been rackin' my brain
it must be as bad as it seems
without you what do I do with me?

without you what do I do with me?---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
