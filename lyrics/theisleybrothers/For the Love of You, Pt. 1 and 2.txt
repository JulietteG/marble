Yeah well-well-well-yeah-hey
Yeah hey-hey ooo!
Driftin' on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Then with you yeah
Loving you well-well-well
Day will make a way for night
I'll we'll need is candle lights
And a song yeah
Soft and long
Well-ooo!
Glad to be here alone
With a lover unlike no other
Sad to see-he a new horizon
Slowly comin' into view yeah
I wanna be living for the love of you
Ah yes I am
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
Alright now yes
Ooo! lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me when the mornin' comes
Feels good to me yeah
My love and me well
Smoother than a gentle breeze
Flowin' through my mind with ease
Soft as can be well
When you're lovin' me
When you're lovin' me
Ooo!
Love to be right in the waves
Of your love enchanted with
A touch and
It seems to me
We could sail together
In and out of mystery
Well I wanna be living
For the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you
You got me girl
I wanna be living
For the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving-giving
Is for the love of you
Oh yes I am
Paradise I have within
Can't feel insecure again
You're the key
Well and this I see
Oh I see
Now and then I lose my way
Using words that try to say
What I feel yeah
Love is real
Oh love is real ooo!
I might as well sign my name
On a card which could say it better
Time will tell cause it seems
That I done just about all that I can do
I know that I'm livin'
For the love of you
Oh yes---Lyrics submitted by joe cross.
