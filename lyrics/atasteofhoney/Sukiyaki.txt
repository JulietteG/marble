It's all because of you
I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away
Now my life is just a rainy day
I love you so
How much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely

Untouchable memories
Seem to keep haunting me
Of a love so true
That once turned all my grey skies blue
But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
I'm wishing you were here with me

Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, I don't know what to do
If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
And the sun would shine

And once again you'd be mine all mine
But in reality
You and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me---Lyrics submitted by Yoshiaki Shimiz.
