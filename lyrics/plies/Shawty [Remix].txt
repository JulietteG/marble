Pleasure:
You got me saying my, my, my, my, my, my, my, huh
Shawty looks good tonight
Look at my shawty, look at my shawty
Look at my shawty

Chorus(Pleasure):
From the first time we made love, I knew you was my (Shawty)
And when I did that bitch, you always had my back, 'cause you are my (Shawty)
That's why I don't mind kickin' up with you, 'cause you are my, my, my, my, my (Shawty)
And girl I love all the freaky things we do (Shawty)(Ah-Ahhh-Ahhhh)

Plies:
I don't call her shawty no more, I call her my bust-it baby
Told her if she ever gave it to me, I was gon' run her crazy
Gave her some of this sweet meat, now I got her cravin'
Felt sorry for my baby, how I left her shakin'
Told her don't move, let me wipe you off baby
Kissed her in her mouth and told her I love how she take it
Put her head on my chest and fell asleep naked
She was shy when I met her, now she participatin'
Keep the lights on so I can see her; she amazing
Sex is hell, I love to watch her while she bathing
Come and wake me up to help her when she shavin'
She my bust-it baby.  She smile when I say it

Trey Songz:
(Shawty)
You got me saying my, my, my, my, my, my, my, oh oh oooh oooh ooh
Shawty looks good tonight
Look at my shawty, look at my shawty

Chorus(Trey Songz):
From the first time we made love, I knew you was my (Shawty)
And then I did that bitch, you always had my back, you are my (Shawty)
That's why I don't mind kickin' up with you, 'cause you are my, my, my, my, my oh-oh ohoh, my, my (Shawty)
And girl I love all the freaky things we do (Shawty)

Plies:
You know she bad cuz she walk with her nose in the air
She findin' everything, don't even matter what she wear
To get her started I just run my fingers through her hair
You know it's mine cuz she let me give it to her bare
I broke bread with her just to show her goon care
What I love about her, she turn me on anywhere
You know she bad...you can't help but stare
I know I had her when she told me baby I don't share
I told her me neither, I don't put my tongue everywhere
She asked me was it good to me, I told her hell yeah
I had to teach her a lil bit, I took her from a square
I put my stamp on it, it's all mine I made it clear

Trey Songz:
(Shawty)
You got me saying my, my, my, my, my, my, my, oh oh oooh oooh ooh
Shawty looks good tonight
Look at my shawty, look at my shawty


Chorus(Pleasure):
From the first time we made love, I knew you was my (Shawty)
And when I did that bitch, you always had my back, 'cause you are my (Shawty)
That's why I don't mind kickin' up with you, 'cause you are my, my, my, my, my (Shawty)
And girl I love all the freaky things we do (Shawty)(Ah-Ahhh-Ahhhh)

Shawty we can do it all night, we can do it all day
Shawty won't you come on at me, get some of ya boy's play
Shawty we can do it all night, we can do it all day
Shawty we can do it all night, we can do it all day
Shawty won't you come on at me, get some of ya boy's play
