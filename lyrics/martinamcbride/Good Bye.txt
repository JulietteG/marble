Occurred to me the other day
You've been gone now a couple years
Well I guess it takes a while
For someone to really disappear
And I remember where I was
When the word came about you
It was a day much like today
The sky was bright and wide and blue

And I wonder where you are
And if the pain ends when you die
And I wonder if there was
Some better way to say good-bye

Today my heart is big and sore
It's trying to poke right through my skin
Won't see you anymore
I guess that's finally sinking in
Cause you can't make somebody see
With the simple words you say
All their beauty from within
Sometimes they just look away

And I wonder where you are
And if the pain ends when you die
And I wonder if there was
Some better way to say good-bye---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
