Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unsure
Makes willpower weak and temptation strong

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man

If you want a do right, all day's woman
You've gotta be a do right, all night's man

Yeah, they say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together, baby
Show some respect for me

If you want a do right, all day's woman
You've gotta be a do right, all night's man

A woman's only human
This you should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man

If you want a do right, all day's woman
You've gotta be a do right, all night's man
You've gotta be a do right, all night's man---
