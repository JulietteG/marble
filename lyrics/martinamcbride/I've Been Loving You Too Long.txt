I've been loving you too long to stop now

You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger as you become a habit to me
Oh, I've been loving you too long
I don't wanna stop now

With you my life has been so wonderful I can't stop now,
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old
I've been loving you, much too long to stop now

I've been loving you a much little too long
I don't wanna stop now, oh,
Please don't make me stop now, oh
I can't stop now
I'm in love in you too long ---
