If I should leave you
Try to remember the good times
One day is filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain

And if you look back
Try to forget all the bad times
Lonely blue and sad times
With just a little bit of rain

And if I look back
I'll remember the good times
One day is filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain ---
