For stumblin through a mess of dances 
For squanderin my second chances 

For wreckin every dream 
And breakin everything I ever had 

Ooh yeah, Im reckless and senseless 
Ive jumped all the fences 
Abandoned all the rules 
And crashed like a fool out of control 
So criminal 
You coulda let me drown 
But you reached your hand out 

And you met me in the fire 
You fanned the flames up higher 
Coulda left me for dead 
But you pulled me from the edge 
For lovin me the way you do 
I know Im reckless but you must be reckless too 

For trustin me when I wasnt worth it 
Forgivin me when I didnt deserve it 
For lookin in my eyes and seein the soul inside 
Cryin cryin cryin 

Im reckless and senseless Ive jumped all the fences 
Abandoned all the rules and crashed like a fool 
Out of control so criminal 
You coulda let me drown 
But you reached your hand out 

And you met me in the fire 
You fanned the flames up higher 
Coulda left me for dead 
But you pulled me from the edge 
For lovin me like you do 
I know Im reckless but you must be reckless too, yeah 

Anyone else woulda run run run run 
Anyone else woulda been done done done done 
Anyone else woulda stepped on the gas and drove away so fast 
And put me in the past 
Cause baby 

Im reckless and senseless 
Ive jumped all the fences 
Abandoned all the rules 
And crashed like a fool out of control 
So criminal 
You coulda let me drown 
But you reached your hand out 

And you met me in the fire 
You fanned the flames up higher 
Coulda left me for dead 
But you pulled me from the edge 
For lovin me the way you do 
I know Im reckless but you must be reckless too---
