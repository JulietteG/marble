Well she seemed all right by dawn's early light 
Though she looked a little worried and weak. 
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again 
But daddy'd left the proof on her cheek. 
And I was only eight years old that summer 
And I always seemed to be in the way 
So I took myself down to the fair in town 
On Independence Day. 

Well ,word gets around in a small, small town 
They said he was a dangerous man 
But mama was proud and she stood her ground 
But she knew she was on the losin' end. 
Some folks whispered and some folks talked 
But everybody looked the other way 
And when time ran out there was no one about 
On Independence Day. 

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing 
Let the whole world know that today 
Is a day of reckoning. 
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong 
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay 
It's Independence Day. 

Well, she lit up the sky that fourth of July 
By the time that the firemen come 
They just put out the flames 
And took down some names 
And send me to the county home. 
Now I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong 
But maybe it's the only way. 
Talk about your revolution 
It's Independence Day. 

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing 
Let the whole world know that today 
Is a day of reckoning. 
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong 
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay 
It's Independence Day. 

Roll the stone away 
It's Independence Day.---
