You take a look, you see I painted you a picture
It's black and white except the bloods a little richer
Down in the corner where i gave it my signature
And then I titled it "This one's for the Winter"
Check it out you see it's just a big disaster

I'll dedicate it to the fact that it's so hard for you to dream
A million heartbeats all around you make it hard to sleep
Doesn't help your freezin' in your bed, your blankets aren't enough 
All you want is someone there, and all you say is' "So what?"

Love love, kiss kiss... blah blah blah
your making me sick I wish you'd just stop
showin off for the rest of us who no one wants to love 
It's hard enough tryin' to drink another Winter all alone
Love love, kiss kiss... blah blah blah

Well do you find you likely to fall in love with people that you'll never gonna need?
It's easier than breaking up and crying the street
Do you curse the happy couple?
Do you cringe at wedding bells?
Do you drink up on the punch while you wish them all to hell?

Love love, kiss kiss... blah blah blah
your making me sick I wish you'd just stop
showin offfor the rest of us who no one wants to love 
It's hard enough tryin' to drink another Winter all alone
Love love, kiss kiss.. blah blah blah

You can't escape, this fatal case of melancholia 
It's in your face, in every place you go it's stalking you 
There are days when you feel you just can't go on
But you felt this way all along!


Love love, kiss kiss... blah blah blah
your making me sick I wish you'd just stop
showin off for the rest of us who no one wants to love 
It's hard enough tryin' to drink another Winter all alone
Love love, kiss kiss... blah blah blah 

Oh, love love love, kiss kiss... blah blah blah
your making me sick I wish you'd just stop
showin off for the rest of us who no one wants to love 
It's hard enough tryin' to drink another Winter all alone
Love love, kiss kiss... blah blah blah---Lyrics submitted by Sam.
