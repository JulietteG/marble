You're in the next room sleeping and I'm shouting out a song for you
I shouldn't wake you over the furnace, but I should swear to someone you'd have loved every note
So dream a good one tonight
I'll listen to the bad ones when they come
Get up in my ear 'till I hear every word
Every turn of your tongue, I will tighten my grip
No one could tell even if I fell 100 stories straight down, down, down
No one could tell even if I fell 100 stories down

I was getting bored with hurting myself
If you fall down enough, well soon enough, you will find hell
It can't be as as pretty as we hoped it would be
It's not even warm here, not even ten degrees

This bed is too big to sleep in, and I'm dying just to feel you breathe
You couldn't see across the ocean, but I was turning over 'till the vampires sleep
So dream a good one tonight
I'll listen to the bad ones when they come
Get up in my ear 'till I hear every word
Every turn of your tongue, I will tighten my grip
No one could tell even if I fell 100 stories straight down, down, down
No one could tell even if I fell 100 stories down

I was getting bored with hurting myself
If you fall down enough, well soon enough, you will find hell
It can't be as as pretty as we hoped it would be
It's not even warm here, not even ten degrees

Dream a good one tonight
Dream a good one tonight
Dream a good one tonight
Dream a good one tonight

I was getting bored with hurting myself
So dream a good one tonight
I was getting bored with hurting myself
So dream a good one tonight
I was getting bored with hurting myself
So dream a good one tonight
I was getting bored with hurting my---Lyrics submitted by samantha.
