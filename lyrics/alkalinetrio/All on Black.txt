I put it all on black, no color you're all dressed in
And a stab in the back left you bleeding on the floor
And I'm mourning the death, the recent passing of your insides
I smile in regret every time I think of how I spoke to you

I put it all in back of my mind where I hold you
I'm just trying to keep track how far back it really goes
And I'm living in lack of the blood sent from the heavens
I'm just trying to relax as the killer's waiting right outside my door

What's black and white?
What's read all over?
This tired book, this organ donor

Sweet blasphemy, my giving tree
It hasn't rained in years
I bring to you this sacrificial offering of virgin ears
Leave it to me, I remain free from all the comforts of home
And where that is, I'm pleased as piss to say, I'll never really know

I put them all in black, the four walls of my bedroom
And I trimmed them in red, peeled your picture off the wall
And I'm living in lack of the blood sent from your heartbeat
That arrived in your neck every time I salivated over you

What's upside down?
What's coated in silver?
This crucifix is my four leaf clover

Sweet blasphemy, my giving tree
It hasn't rained in years
I bring to you this sacrificial offering of virgin ears
Leave it to me, I remain free from all the comforts of home
And where that is, I'm pleased as piss to say, I'll never really know

One of these days, it's gonna catch up to you
Throwing looks like those around
One of these nights, I promise to you
I'll soon be sleeping sound
As soon as I leave town---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
