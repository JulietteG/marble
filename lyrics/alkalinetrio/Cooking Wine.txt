Sorry I'm late
I was out spoiling my liver
I couldn't wait
The sun was up for far too long today
And I can't see straight
But the two of you look awfully pretty
And I couldn't wait
Been awake for far too long today

And is it strong enough
Too burn away
The cooking wine

And I'm just tired enough
If I close my eyes I'll sleep for days
I'll sleep for days---Lyrics submitted by charletta parks.
