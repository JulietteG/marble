I wrote the words to this song on the back of a photograph
Behind your back it goes
A little something like this is way to big to miss
I got a letter in the mail
The sender failed to let me know where it came from
Opened it up and sure enough there we were
arm in arm (up in arms) again
I know it's small but my last call's been called
half an hour ago
I know it's late but do you think you could at least
fix it for me
Then I'll go I'll go alone I swear
I won't tell a soul
I'll drink this beer and write in fear
of a song everybody hates
Armageddon, let the light in
Before we say goodbye give us something to believe in
Armageddon, we're not begging
For too much I don't think
Just need a goodbye kiss (one last salute)
Before we sink
We sink---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
