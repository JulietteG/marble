i can't believe my hearts still pounding
i can't believe how close i came
and meanwhile heavens falling
a falliong angel flown away
and that'll be me some day
with stolen wings and evil ways
straight south with the keys to the pearly gates
hard to believe my heart stopped pounding 
hard to believe i played this game
my worst nightmares became real
i got so scared that i forgot my name
and that'll be me some day
with stolen wings and evil ways
straight south with the keys to the pearly gates---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
