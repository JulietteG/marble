Here it is again,
Yet it stings like the first time.
Seems it never ends, 
Double nickels on your death.
I thought we were friends, 
I guess it just depends who you ask
These feelings tend to leave me with a hole in my chest
Now the time has come i just wish i could erase
All the damage done to your name and your keepsakes
Only just begun, it's been fun, we were blind, deaf, and dumb
there's a party in my closet, calling all skeletons
where did you go once the lights went black?
look what's become of me. i've grown to love your disappearing acts
do one more pretty please...
now the time has come i just wish i could erase
all the damage done, all this pain all this heartache
only just begun, it's been fun, we were fucked up and numb
there's a killer on the corner and he's looking for love
yeah, he's looking for you, my love
where did you go once the lights went black?
look what's become of me. i've grown to love your disappearing acts
do one more pretty please...
and to tell the truth i lost my faith in you
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
and these unspoken lies appear at the worst times
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
they're hiding just behind your eyes
where did you go once the lights went black?
look what's become of me. i've grown to love your disappearing acts
do one more pretty please...
where did you go once the lights went black?
you nearly gave us a heart attack
we thought you might've swam out to sea
you gotta stop sneaking off on me
you gotta stop sneaking off on me---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
