The sunrise fills your eyes, cannot hear your cries 
Pleading please just go away
I can't take another day of this
No surprise, a surplus of lies, freed from the skies

Is there something that I missed?
Can't even take another day of this
Lower than piss, have you ever felt like this?
She can't recall the last time she avoided it
Lower than piss, have you ever felt like this?
Judging by your eyes like crystal balls
Madam Me is predicting that your answer will be yes

The sunrise burned out your eyes, failed to apologize
As it was eating at your face, 
took your smile away without a trace of it
Warmer than piss have you ever felt like this?
It just might take a fever to encounter it 
Knee deep in shit there's no avoiding it
From your knees you're coated brown, 
to your toes there is no sound like this

And I will keep you warm in hell
And I will keep you warm in hell
And I will keep you warm in hell
Way down in hell---Lyrics submitted by David.
