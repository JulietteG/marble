Shaking like a dog shittin' razorblades, waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me I'm waking up all alone, waking up so relieved while you're taking your time with apologies, I'm making my plans for revenge Red eyes on orange horizons If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge I'd drive straight off the edge Taking your own life with boredom, I'm taking my own life with wine - it helps you to rule out the sorrow, it helps me to empty my mind Making the most of a bad time I'm smoking the brains from my head Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red This kettle is seeing red I've got a big fat fuckin' bone to pick with you my darling In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you, plugged in and ready to fall Shaking like a dog shittin' razorblades, waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me I'm waking up all alone, waking up so relieved while your taking your time with apologies,I'm planning out my revenge Red eyes on orange horizons If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge I'm seeing red I've got a big fat fuckin' bone to pick with you my darling In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you, plugged in and ready to fall Plugged in a ready to fall Plugged in and ready to fall Plugged in and ready to fall---Lyrics submitted by Kimberly.
