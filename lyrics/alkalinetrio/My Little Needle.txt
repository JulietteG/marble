I'll come down to get you high
Or maybe sing you a lullabye
Sing you to sleep - a sleep youll never wake from
Sing you to coma so to speak

When I fall down I'll fall apart
Trade in my bike for a shopping cart
And beg change from a world that needs some
Like I need someone
So where are you my little needle? 
The stacks been burned away but I'm so inebriated that I cannot see
Three feet in front of me
Between the moon and you, lunacy is setting in

Lately I've been feeling dead inside
Like my guts have dried up and died
But every night I water them back to life
Yeah every night I water them back to life

When I fall down I'll fall apart
Trade in my bike for a shopping cart
And beg change from a world that needs some
I'm tired of sleeping alone
So where are you my little needle? 
The stacks been burned away but I'm so inebriated that I cannot see
Three feet in front of me
Between the moon and you, lunacy is setting in---Lyrics submitted by tony.
