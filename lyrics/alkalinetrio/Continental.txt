I've got a dying urge to feel the way you do 
to close for comfort  bed and breakfast in a spoon
the shortest breath of your young life 
a long walk home on friday night 
you made one last stop at the store
so close to perfect swear to hell thought it was you
this bouncing baby boy's now turning baby blue
I've got no pictures on my walls
Ive got a long list of calls i must make
to your existing family 

You had nine lives and one by one you chewed them up 
Your final coffin nail been driven far to much 
this wont take long you said i'm not goin far
go wait in the car go wait in the car

I often wonder what it feels to be you
a mess like this stuck on your hands with crazy glue
ran out of time no kiss good bye
wish i could learn to let this sleeping dog die
without lying to myself

You had nine lives and one by one you chewed them up 
Your final coffin nail been driven far to much 
this wont take long you said i'm not goin far
go wait in the car go wait in the car

You had nine lives and one by one you chewed them up 
Your final coffin nail been driven far to much 
this wont take long you said i'm not goin far
go wait in the car go wait in the car---Lyrics submitted by Jeremy.
