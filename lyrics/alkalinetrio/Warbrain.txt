[Spoken:]
"Thoughts are the shadows of feelings, always darker, emptier, and simpler.
I don't care if they're fake or real, I just thank them for showing up at all.
I have black periods. Who does not? But they are not a part of me;
They are not a part of illness, but a part of my being. What am I saying?
I have the courage to have them. Four o' clock in the morning. This sucks."

I can't go on
You said my head's too heavy.
I need that song,
Those trusty chords can pull me through,
And early on,
They saw the warning signs and symptoms all day long.
We'd sit and dream of better days.
When we hit the ground, running on empty,
Stories we've been told.
And now those nights we've spent together,
Never felt this fucking cold.

When we let the car run in the driveway,
Kiss you one last time
Before you brought the horses in
Before the storm of '59, of '59, of '59.

I can't go on.
These limbs have grown too heavy.
I need that song.
A night on earth could pull me through,
And early on,
They saw the warning signs and symptoms all day long.
Wonder how far from here we'll fall.

Before we hit the ground running on empty,
Stories we've been told.
And now the nights we've spent together never felt this fucking cold.
When we let the car run in the driveway,
Kiss you one last time.
Before you brought the horses in,
Before the storm of '59, of '59, of '59, of '59, of '59. 
(Nine, nine, nine, nine. Nine, nine, nine, nine.)---Lyrics submitted by Ben.
