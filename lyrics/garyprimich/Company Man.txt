Late at night my minds adrift
Clockin' off this mid-night shift
Everybody's all gone home
My fingers worn down to the bone

I got a white sedan
And a highway plan
Givin' all I can
I'm a company man

I worked so hard to get my turf
I ain't never been paid what mi worth
That don't bother me at all
Cause I got my money on the longest haul

I got a white sedan
And a highway plan
Givin' all I can
I'm a company man

It ain't my job to know what's sold
They got me here and I do what I'm told
When the dust is settled and the smoke is clear
I'm the one still workin' here

I got a white sedan
And a highway plan
Givin' all I can
I'm a company man

I've been kicked, had my face slapped
I clawed my way outta more than one trap
Live to toil another day
I earned every inch of my pay

I got a white sedan
And a highway plan
Givin' all I can
I'm a company man ---Lyrics submitted by Ric Tomasik.
