Standin on the corner
With a suitcase in my hand
Standin on the corner
With a suitcase in my hand
Oh Brother can you spare a ride
For a most unlucky man

I gambled on my future
With a bad poker hand
I gamled on my future
With a bad poker hand
So Brother won't you help a
Sad and broken hearted man

I took chances, I got reckless
Thinkin I was number one
I took so many chances
Thinkin I was number one
Now I am so sorry 
Now that the deal is done

Instrumental 

Take me to the highway
I'll make the next town on my own
Take me to the highway
I'll make the next town on my own
I can't believe I lost my good friend
And that I'm all alone

I gambled, I gambled
But gamblers always lose
I gambled, I gambled
But gamblers always lose
Now this bad and wild life
is the only kind to choose---Lyrics submitted by Rick Hyde.
