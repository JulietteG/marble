Chorus:
I cant stand you when youre drinkin,
And I cant please you when youre dry.
I cant stand you when youre drinkin,
And I cant please you when youre dry.
I cant win in this position,
Im gonna have to say goodbye.

Lyrics: 
The man who owns the liquor store,
Cross the avenue,
He bought himself a sailboat,
And he named it after you.
You drink that stuff like water baby.
Oh, why dont you take a break?
Cause I cant stand you when youre drinkin,
And when youre dry youre just the same.

They say youre mama was a screamer.
Well she must have passed it down.
Cause I could hear you cuss me
From the other side of town.
I come home for twenty minutes,
You ask when Ill be gone.
Why dont you take up with the mailman?
He never stays for very long.  

(Harp solo)

The boy who brings the paper round,
Got somethin up his sleeve.
Cause I cancelled our subscription,
And he still dont wanna leave.
You must have messed his mind up baby,
Cause when youre not around,
He stands out on the corner,
And he begs just like a hound.

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Chris Balding.
