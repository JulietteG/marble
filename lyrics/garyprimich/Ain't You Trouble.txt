I heard about your racket, 
From a friend of mine in town.
Said you are the Queen of  Spades, 
And throwin jokers down.

Chorus:
Aint you trouble baby.
Aint you trouble baby. 
Lord I swear your name is trouble,
You know Im sure we met before.

I could sit for hours
And gaze into your pretty eyes.
Windows to your soul
Are just a thinly veiled disguise.

(Chorus)
(Guitar solo)

Ive been runnin from you
Ever since the day we met.
And everytime I see you 
I smell fear and sense regret.

(Chorus)
(Harp solo)

The twisted path I walk
Is where you took my hand and led.
And I could eat my words for years
Inside your sticky web.

(Chorus) 
(Harp ending)---Lyrics submitted by Chris Balding.
