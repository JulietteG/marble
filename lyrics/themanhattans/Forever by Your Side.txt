Friends, we started out as friends
Friends turned into lovers
Do you remember when

I held you
For the very first time
Love me it is so easy girl
For me to speak my mind

I've said:
I want you
I need you
Oh girl how I believe in you
You're the light that has always seen me through
In you I could find
That I will be
Forever by your side

Now we see our love has grown
And these have been the sweetest times
That I have ever known
And I know that it will never end,
'Cause every time I look at you,
I fall in love again

I want you (want you)
I need you (need you)
Oh girl how I believe in you (youre the light)
You're the light (that shines)
That has always seen me through
In you I could find
That I will be
Forever by your side

Longer than the sun will shine,
Love is a tie that binds, forever, forever
Two hearts are meant to be one love eternally
Together (together), forever, forever

I want you
I need you
Oh girl how I believe in you
You're the light that has always seen me through
In you I could find
That I will be
Forever by your side---Lyrics submitted by TIffany.
