Oooooo, Oooo
Honey, Honey, girl you know I'm gonna, gonna get 'cha
Honey, Honey, you know I've gotta get with ya

If kissing and touching really turn you on, let me make love to you
Let me make love to you

Let's , 'til broad daylight
We're gonna , oh honey so right
Stay right here sweet honey let's do, together

Just lay here in my arms
Girl hold me tight, girl we got all night, let me make love to you

We're gonna , In the middle of the night
Let's , 'til broad daylight
We're gonna , oh honey so right
Stay right here sweet honey let's do, together
together

Now honey, I need encouragement, if you want this high
If kissing and touching really turn you on, let's reach for the sky
Let's reach for the sky
Tell me

You reach over and hold me tight, I'll reach over and turn out the light
We're gonna , In the middle of the night

Stay right here sweet honey let's do it

Let's , 'til broad daylight
