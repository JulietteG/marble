If my heart could speak
Then it could tell you
How I feel about you

And it's not that I don't care
But my lips won't dare
Say what I want them to

If my lonely heart could speak
If my lonely heart could speak

Ahhhh You'd be surprised at
What it would say to you
Yes if my heart could speak
I would have no problem
Everything I could explain

Oh and if I do you wrong
Wouldn't take to long
For my heart to know I caused you pain

If my lonely heart could speak
If my lonely heart could speak
Ahhhh darling you'd, you'd be surprised
At what it would say to you

I've tried so hard to find the words
Oooo but my stubborn heart
Just remains...
Bashful, speechless, and full of love
Yes bashful, speechless and unchanined

But hearts weren't made that way
So my lips will have to say
What I want, what I want you to know
Ooooh and it's no secret then
I'll always want you near
Cause I love you, yes I love you so

Though my lonely heart can't speak
And my lips are there released
I'm telling you that you'd, you'd be surprised
At what it would say to you

If my lonely heart could speak
(If my heart could speak my darling)
If my lonely heart could speak
(It would tell you, it would tell you how I feel about you)
If my lonely heart could speak
(It would tell you how I want you and need you)
If my lonely heart could speak
(It would say these words darling)
If my lonely heart could speak
(It would say I love you, I love you, I love you)---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca Gomez.
