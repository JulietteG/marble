Feeling low
I guess it's just my luck to be this way
Do you really have to go?
When girl you know I still want you to stay
I've been a fool
Spending my nights in bars and having fun
And leaving you home alone
When I should have been there getting my homework done.

Do you really mean goodbye?
I can see it now
The hurt that you're feeling
And I realize that I couldn't stand the pain
And all, all this talk about leaving
Is gonna make me lonesome country boy again

Yes I know that it's my fault if you go away
But give me one more try
And girl never again will I go astray

Do you really mean goodbye?
I can see it now
The hurt that you're feeling
And I realize that I couldn't stand the pain
If I can't
If I can't stop you from leaving
You're gonna make lonesome country boy again
You're gonna make me lonesome country boy...
Again (long note)
You're gonna make me lonesome country boy'
Again---
