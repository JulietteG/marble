I don't need to know your address
To know where you live
I know that road by heart
I know where you been

Don't even try runnin'
Baby you know i give good lovin'
Got your eyes on somebody else's somethin'

Oh won't you try to love me
Try to love me

Why go lookin' for someone when your someone's right here
You get everything for free, so why must you steal
What's the use in cheating
Where's the truth and tell me what's the meaning

Baby my engine's already been running
Oh won't you try to love me
C'mon
C'mon C'mon C'mon C'mon baby try!
C'mon C'mon C'mon C'mon baby try!
C'mon C'mon C'mon C'mon baby try!
Try to love me, try!
Try to Love me

Stop misusin'
Stop confusin' me with those other girls
Cause I been there for you baby
I been here for you honey
So try..yyy to love me

C'mon
C'mon C'mon C'mon C'mon baby try!
C'mon C'mon C'mon C'mon baby try!
C'mon C'mon C'mon C'mon baby try!
Try to love, love, love, love, love, love
Try to Love me
Try to Love me
Try to Love me ---Lyrics submitted by alexis contois.
