1999 and the stakes is high.
Our options have come down 
to either we do or we die. 
We need You now more than ever.
Pull out all of the strife in the church, 
get us together. 
Is time running out?
I can't say. I do know 
We have one day less 
than we did yesterday.
So it's up to us to unite,
You wanna fight the power?
You need the power to fight.

And can we sing with one voice, 
if we all love the same God?
Can we agree to disagree?
And so we cry with one voice
to the only God in all the universe, 
who holds us in His hands. 

No more time 
for us to bicker and complain, 
if we're called by the same name, 
there's nowhere for us to lay the blame, 
except for ourselves.
And if we died to our old selves
we've come alive as God's flesh, 
that makes us family
Deeper than death,
but we don't act so tight
when there's a back to bit.
Are we less like a family, and 
more like a fistfight?
Are we there, but nor quite?
Are hypocrites children of light?---Lyrics submitted by Matthew.
