Oh baby when you're next to me
I feel like I'm in ecstasy, uh-uh
Oh baby when you look my way
I hear the things you wanna say, uh-huh
And when your body moves close to mine
I get a rush I can't describe
And you get my heart beating like
Oh baby, oh baby

'Cause you know that we will find
Someone new it's about that time
And nothing could be better

I want your sweet talk
Talking to me all night
Leaving me with love, this love
I want your sweet talk
Keep 'em coming, don't stop
Till we turn the lights back on
Baby, I want you to
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me

I've seen this on your lips
I need a taste of it
Don't need a better pie
His sugar always gets me so high
I'm living in a fantasy
I'm loving out my wildest dreams
When your thing touch my mic
I start to lose control
And when you kiss me just like that
Oh baby, oh baby

'Cause you know that we will find
Someone new it's about that time
And nothing could be better

I want your sweet talk
Talking to me all night
Leaving me with love, this love
I want your sweet talk
Keep 'em coming, don't stop
Till we turn the lights back on
Baby, I want you to
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me

I've seen this on your lips
I need a taste of it

Sweet talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me

I want your sweet talk
Talking to me all night
Leaving me with love, this love
I want your sweet talk
Keep 'em coming, don't stop
Till we turn the lights back on
Baby, I want you to
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me

I've seen this on your lips
I need a taste of it

Sweet talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me

I've seen this on your lips
I need a taste of it---
