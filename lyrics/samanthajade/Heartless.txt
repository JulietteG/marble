In the night, I hear them talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, you lost your soul to a woman so heartless...
Oh, How could you be so heartless?
Oh

How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
And now you wanna get me back and you can show me.
So you walk around like you don't know me.
You got a new friend. Well I got homies
And in the end your still so lonely

In the night, I hear them talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, you lost your soul to a woman so heartless...Yeah
How could you be so heartless?
Oh...

I know you can't believe.
I shouldn't just leave it wrong.
I'm gon take off tonight.

And in the night, I hear them talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, you lost your soul to a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... 

How could you be so heartless........---Lyrics submitted by alexa brown.
