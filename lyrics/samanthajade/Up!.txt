(Step step step up)
This is somethin for the radio
(Step step step up)
This is somethin for the radio
(Step step step up)
This is somethin for the radio
(Step step step up)

Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets 
This love will have no regrets 
As long as when we 
Stepping on the dance floor 
It's me and you 

Feel the rhythm of the beat 
That's my heart 
Cupid shot me with an arrow 
From the start 
And you know that it's your love that's got me trapped 
Every time I try to leave, you bring me back 

So much harder at times I cried a river 
You dried my eyes and brought me back laughter
And when I lay next to you I want to wake up 
And when I break up 
It's only to make up 

Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets 
This love will have no regrets 
As long as when we 
Stepping on the dance floor 
It's me and you 

And if we don't step up 
We'll lose our groove 
So confused, don't know which way to move 
Hold my hand and let me know that you feel me too 
Look into my eyes and tell me 
Baby I love you 

You'll never get wet 
'Cause I'll be your umbrella 
And we can make it through any kind of weather 
If you step up 
I'll step up 
Boy 
'Cause I'm trying to be with you forever 

Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets 
This love will have no regrets 
As long as when we 
Stepping on the dance floor 
It's me and you 

And when the symphony plays, I feel my feet 
Lifting from underneath 
You grab my hand 
Spin me around 
And right before I fall 
You catch me and you say 
Baby, it'll be okay 
Just look into my eyes and we will make another day 

Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets 
This love will have no regrets 
As long as when we 
Stepping on the dance floor 
It's me and you

Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets 
This love will have no regrets 
As long as when we 
Stepping on the dance floor 
It's me and you

Step Up

(Step step step up)
This is somethin for the radio
(Step step step up)
This is somethin for the radio
(Step step step up)
This is somethin for the radio
(Step step step up)

Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets 
This love will have no regrets 
As long as when we 
Stepping on the dance floor 
It's me and you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
