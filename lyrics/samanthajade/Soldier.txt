Mmm... Mmm...

I'm laying here in the darkness
The middle of nowhere
There's no one in sight
Caught in the madness
Don't wanna be like this
I'm losing my mind

Wanna see inside your head
What's going on in there?
Tell me where you are
So I can stop and take a breath
Cause nothing's making sense
I don't want this to end
Come and get me out of this mess

I want you to stay (oh), stay (oh)
Stay with me a little longer
Why don't you stay (oh), stay (oh)
Don't you wanna be my Soldier?
Now, would you fight for me?
D-d-d-die for me?
Would wanna be with me forever
Why don't you stay (oh), stay (oh)
Don't you wanna be my Soldier?
(Whoa-oh)

You brought me out of my shell
Put me under your spell
Now I'm walking a straight line
To you
I'll never surrender
You're my pain and pleasure all together

Wanna see inside your head
What's going on in there?
Tell me where you are
So I can stop and take a breath
Cause nothing's making sense
I don't want this to end
Come and get me out of this mess

I want you to stay (oh), stay (oh)
Stay with me a little longer
Why don't you stay (oh), stay (oh)
Don't you wanna be my Soldier?
Now, would you fight for me?
D-d-d-die for me?
Would wanna be with me forever
Why don't you stay (oh), stay (oh)
Don't you wanna be my Soldier?
(Whoa-oh)

If only it was us against the world
(Tell me, tell me, tell me)
Tell me, would you stand for all the worth?
(Worth, worth)
Your silence is a gun, gun, gun, gun
Aiming at the one, one, one, one
Who's still the same
My love won't change
(Love won't change...)

(Stay...)
Stay (oh), stay (oh)
Stay with me a little longer
Why don't you stay (oh), stay (oh)
(Stay...)
Don't you wanna be my Soldier?
Now, would you fight for me?
D-d-d-die for me?
Would wanna be with me forever
Why don't you stay (oh), stay (oh)
(Stay, stay, yeah...)
Don't you wanna be my Soldier?
(Whoa-oh)

(Oh, oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh) Yeah
(Oh, oh, oh) Be my Soldier, soldier
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh) But, would you die for me?
(Oh, oh, oh)
Die for me?
(Oh, oh, oh) Be my Soldier, soldier
(Oh, oh, oh-oh) ---
