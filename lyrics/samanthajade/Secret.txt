Why dont you be a man
Hold a thought and dont see
You dont understand
If you got a medal take it in your hands
We forgot the situation
Where you got your education

Ohh oh ooh
Ohh oh ooh

Take a stance
Stop the second guessing
Your searching too fast
Make your mind up
While Im giving you a chance
Why, you know the situation
(Incomprehensible)

Ohh oh ooh

Somebodys got a little secret
Somebody doesnt know I know it
You think youd be breaking my heart (heart) (heart) (heart)
You think its breaking my heart

Ohh oh ooh

Dont waste your time trying to deny it
What youre trying to hide is off the classic
You think youd be breaking my heart (heart) (heart) (heart)

Set it free
Truth it always comes to light
Eventually
Im upset to hear and clear apology
Im not buying no underswayting
Hurry up Im hesitating

Ohh oh ooh

And yeah I-I always knew
Playing games was for 2
And yeah I-I always knew
It was 2, good for you
So I just let you pass
But no ones getting compensated
Youre the cause of my frustation

Ohh ooohh yeeaahh

Ohh oh ooh

Somebodys got a little secret
Somebody doesnt know I know it
You think youd be breaking my heart (heart) (heart) (heart)
You think its breaking my heart

Ohh oh ooh

Dont waste your time trying to deny it
What youre trying to hide is off the classic
You think youd be breaking my heart (heart) (heart) (heart)

(Incomprehensible)
Yes, what we used to say
But I guess I meant nothing real to you
Theres nothing left to do
Cause Im so over you

Get somebody but me
You think its breaking my heart (yeah)(yeah)(yeah)(yeah)
You think its breaking my heart !

Ohh oh ooh

Somebodys got a little secret (Somebodys)
(Oh oh ohh)
Somebody doesnt know I know it (no no)
You think youd be breaking my heart (heart) (heart) (heart) (ooooohhh)
You think its breaking my heart (breaking my heart)

Ohh oh ooh

Dont waste your time trying to deny it
What youre trying to hide is off the classic (oooohhh) (ooohhyeeaah)
You think youd be breaking my heart (heart) (heart) (heart)
