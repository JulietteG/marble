You can be my match stick, light me up!
If you love me in the way that I wanted, play the part!
Hmmm, come and lead me down, down, down, down
Only take a minute, starting my ignition
It's gonna burn when you're touching me, when you're touching me!

We, we're flying recklessly tonight
Go on and take me higher
You could be my firestarter!
We, we're flying recklessly tonight
Go on and take me higher
You could be my firestarter, oh!

Come on the red light, don't you stop
Cause I loved the way you playin' it honest to get in the dark, yeah, yeah
Come and lead me down, down, down, down
Only take a minute, starting my ignition, yeah!
It's gonna burn when you're touching me, when you're touching me!

We, we're flying recklessly tonight
Go on and take me higher
You could be my firestarter!
We, we're flying recklessly tonight
Go on and take me higher
You could be my firestarter, oh!

There you are like a flamethrower to my heart, yeah, yeah
Got the things that I need to make it start, oh, oh!
You're the flame thrower
You're the firestarter!
You're the flame thrower
You're the firestarter!
You're the flame thrower
You're the firestarter!

We, we're flying recklessly tonight
Go on and take me higher
You could be my firestarter!
We, we're flying recklessly tonight
Go on and take me higher
You could be my firestarter, oh!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
