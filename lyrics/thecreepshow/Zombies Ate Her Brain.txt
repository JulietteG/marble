I'd like to tell a little story
About a girl from far away
You might feel bad, you might feel sorry
About what happened, so they say

Well once upon a time there was a sweetheart
A pretty girl with lips of red
She took a walk down by the graveyard
And out of nowhere something 
Grabbed her head!

I heard that zombies ate her brain 
(zombies ate her brain, zombies ate her brain)
That's how she turned out this way!

Sometimes you'll see her walking downtown
Not many notice the undead
Can't ask the girl a simple question
Because shell never ever understand!

Because those zombies ate her brain 
(zombies ate her brain, zombies ate her brain)
That's how she turned out
That's how she turned out
Thats how she turned out this way!---Lyrics submitted by monique.
