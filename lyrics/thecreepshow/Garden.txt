Theres a dark fading light
In the garden where you
Lay your head tonight
Through the darkened hours
Were you thinking of me?
A state of sleep
Is what youd rather be

Theres a pale
Purple moonlight
In the garden where you
Lay your head to die
Frozen dreams and nightmares
Have you forgetting a dream
Of what you always thought
You could have been

Hey dont draw the line
Did you know that youre right
So baby blue dont cry
Dont you go now
Dont you go now

Theres a stale morning light
In the garden where you lay
All through the night
Through this poisoned nightmare
Have you set yourself free?
With thoughts and dreams
Of what youre gonna be

Hey dont draw the line
Did you know that youre right
So baby blue dont cry
Dont you go now
Dont you go now

Hey dont draw the line
Did you know itll be all right
So baby blue dont cry
Dont you go now
Dont you go now

Hey dont draw the line
Did you know itll be all right
My baby blues dont cry
Dont you go now
Dont you go now
Hey dont draw the line
Did you know that youre right
So baby blue dont cry
Dont you go now
Dont you go now---Lyrics submitted by monique.
