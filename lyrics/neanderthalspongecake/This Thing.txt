I've got this thing
 I've got this thing
 It won't die
 It's everlasting
 It won't stop
 It's never ending

 If I could only have my way
 I know I'd make you wanna stay
 And as the days and weeks drag by
 I know I'll start to wonder why
 I still don't feel satisfied

 There's a burning pain inside
 An ulcer from the cyanide
 Smoker's cough and I can't breath
 Stomach bile cakes my teeth
 There's something there that's out of reach---Lyrics submitted by Dan.
