oil remove shred and tear radiation vapor

it's the fear so unclear man in motion going nowhere

in our homes stuck in the face spread the word to the populace

yellow journal yellow journal set the pace feel the rage

manifestations of a sort so insidious off the point

simple solution never confusion sport a gun kill a cop

crazy world of weary thought so receive me had enough

lock me up lock me up

rot and assimilate so hot to annihilate

deviation tonic mess prolonged existence innocence

is he who speaks isn't weak wheelchair virtue so to speak

bubonic plague the truth of aids immunity avoid decay

in the trench of pestilence the bible screams announce your faith

mutterings of death to bring suffocate a newborn thing

degradation of an age venereal it's all sensation

protect design the moral plan infallible as propaganda

completely black with no steps back

hot to assimilate we'll rot or annihilate

agony profusely stains the inner thinking of the brain

accusations clanking chains experiments with the groans of pain

all prefer no one blames the terror in an animal's screams

in cages our future - the answers insane---Lyrics submitted by Dimitris.
