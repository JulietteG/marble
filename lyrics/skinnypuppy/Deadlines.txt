I saw just what it does, 
When it's too hard for you to face it
It's still pushing you to make it
That's been no new news to me
Cause' it's all been done before

Four years and we're still counting down
Until all your precious time is wasted
It's been nothing new to me, to me, to me-e-e

We still haven't grown a custom to the sound
As they all begin to drown you out
It's all been done before
    (Chorus)
When your deadlines become my days in life
So tell me all your favorite lines
What do you meanin' it don't fault
As your dead, last day tonight

And you, were startled by the fact
That you could've had it better off by now
It's not over
Until we quiet our count down
Oh yes, my being to plain, to stand on silent ground
It got old but, you can't blame it all on me, on me, on me-e-e

We still haven't grown a custom to the sound
As they all begin to drown you out
It's all been done before
   (Chorus)
When your deadlines
Become my days in life
So tell me, all your favorite lines
What do you meanin' it don't fault
Please don't give up
(RPT x3)
As you die, last day tonight 

I saw just what it does
When it's too hard for you to face it
They're still pushing you to make it
It's been nothing new to me, to me-e

We still haven't grown a custom to the sound
As they all begin to drown you out
It's all been done before
       (Chorus)
When your deadlines
Become my days in life
So tell me, all your favorite lines
What do you mean that it don't fault
As you die, last day tonight
As you die, last day tonight
All your favorite lines
What do you meanin' it don't fault
As you die, last day tonight---Lyrics submitted by Devvi.
