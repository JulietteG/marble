(a dream) rest low tar spell fatigue vermin crawling in livid gnaws
Fasting on tic and a flea in vain again agro flight not taking fasting
On deception in the making turns two against three penny save a
Penny worth crystal marble powder shot glass overflow dreams amaze me
Time escapes me mirror shades what should be flight not taking rest
A bodies burning compose ears of rock guilty grey formaldehyde cripples
Hound a wheelchair guilty grey a wheelchair hounds you asshole dead palsey
Blue stupid thaw cuts the jaw hell piss fuck head rest pure acid hell
Filthy word mutation laughing hound hereafter stupid clown you asshole---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
