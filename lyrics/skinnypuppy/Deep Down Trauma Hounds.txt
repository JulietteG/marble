Injured plea crushed destiny deep down
Trauma hounds run to corrode integrity whatever matters and it would
They fail to see they make believe reality helpless deaths
Ignored to be judged as juvenile head caves in growing pains no time
Remains for fantasy tyrrany exists shrink beneath the ingrown thorns forced
To accept pledge allegiance to a flag tested to forget you must
Resist they want you dead feels emptyness eternity keeps swallowing
Digested benefactors whose silence deafens anything all of whom
Decease and miss to pierce a point objects and lessons to realize
It's not the way what's the point of giving up leaving won't change anything
Political resentment to push away all growth withing puzzles me offers
Soul to nothing the message screams it's purity that those with no rights
Display the right to have no life do have respect they must accept
A world commiting suicide---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
