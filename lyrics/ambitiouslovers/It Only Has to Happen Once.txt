It only has to happen once 
For anybody elses skin to feel 
Rough or too thin 
All it takes is a quick constellation 
Of daylight, headlights 
And precipitation It only has to happen once 
For anybody elses sweat to taste 

Too salty or sweet It doesnt take two nations or two signatures 
Just two pupils and one fool It only has to happen once 
It only has to happen once 
For every caress to read as 
Desperate or repressed---
