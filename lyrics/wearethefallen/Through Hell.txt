Are we alone?
Is there more than we believe in?
Haunting these walls
Shadows crawling out revealing
Fear in me
Stays in me

The nightmares inside here
My dark fears all in my head again
The nightmares I fight here
All my tears pull me through hell again

I wake in the night
And I pray that I've been dreaming
There's nowhere to hide
From this nightmare calling to me
Fear in me
Stays in me

The nightmares inside here
My dark fears all in my head again
The nightmares I fight here
All my tears pull me through hell again

The nightmares inside here
My dark fears all in my head again
The nightmares I fight here
All my tears pull me through hell again

The nightmares inside here
My dark fears all in my head again
The nightmares I fight here
All my tears pull me through hell again---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Lowe.
