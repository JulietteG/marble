Falling to my knees before you, 
So ashamed to see my weakness fill your eyes, 
Needlessly, I let myself stray before you, 
Now I face the consequence of my betrayal. 

My paradigm, my sweet love I breathe, 
It's you I rely on, 
Shelter me from cold, I die in paradigm. 

Do we sacrifice, let our story die? 
Blissful lullabies return again, 
If we still a while, let love survive, 
Delicately crawling to your grave. 

My paradigm, my sweet love I breathe, 
It's you I rely on, 
Shelter me from cold, I die in paradigm. 

Perfect sky, shadow find my lies, 
Good enough for always wanting mine 
Replaced all your love with pain 
So afraid to face the world alone. 

My paradigm, my sweet love I breathe 

My paradigm, my sweet love I breathe, 
It's you I rely on, 
Shelter me from cold, and die in paradigm. 

(Die in paradigm, die in paradigm, die in paradigm, die in paradigm)---Lyrics submitted by Nikki.
