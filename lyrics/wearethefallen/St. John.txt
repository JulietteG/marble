This night is alive with the smell of insane
It's reaching for me and it's calling my name
I beg for silence to drown out their weep
How did this asylum become where I sleep
So ashamed of waking
All my life you failed to keep me safe
My whole world's forsaken
Won't let you destroy my faith again

All my questions get no answers
Locked up tight from the world outside me
NO, NO
Mommy come get me out tonight

All my questions have no answers
I can feel the fear inside me
NO, NO
Mommy come get me out tonight

So close I almost could taste my own grave
My moments of selfishness caused by your pain
Almost threw this life you gave me away
In this institution for you now I pray
So ashamed of waking
All my life you failed to keep me safe
My whole world's forsaken
Won't let you destroy my faith again

All my questions get no answers
Locked up tight from the world outside me
NO, NO
Mommy come get me out tonight

All my questions have no answers
I can feel the fear inside me
NO, NO
Mommy come get me out tonight

Forgive me
With wings adorn me 
So I can fly

All my questions get no answers
Locked up tight from the world outside me
NO, NO
Mommy come get me out tonight

All my questions have no answers
I can feel the fear inside me
NO, NO
Mommy come get me out tonight

Mommy come get me out tonight---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Lowe.
