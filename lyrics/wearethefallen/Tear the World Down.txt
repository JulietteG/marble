I've fought another day
Lose another chance to break away
From all I cannot bear
I suffer through the shame
Wishing hope would just abandon me
Till this is over

My loveless life
I'm lost in you tonight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down

Time and time again
Take it all and take the fall for you
Fear is all I hold
Bound and beaten down
All the pain I can't escape today
Is always with me

My loveless life
I'm lost in you tonight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down
My darkest night
Your arms that hold me tight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down

All my love is lost
All my hope is gone
All my love is lost
All my hope is gone

My loveless life
I'm lost in you tonight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down
My darkest night
Your arms that hold me tight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Lowe.
