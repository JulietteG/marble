There's no use in crying, 
All my tears won't drown my pain, 
Free me from your sorrow, 
I can't grieve you again. 

I watched you let yourself die, 
Now it's too late to save you this time. 

You bury me alive, 
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow, 
Don't leave me to die, 
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies. 

All I did was love you, 
Now I hate the nightmare you've become, 
I can't let you fool me, 
I won't need you again. 

I watched you let yourself die, 
Now it's too late to save you this time. 

You bury me alive, 
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow, 
Don't leave me to die, 
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies. 

You bury me alive, 
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow, 
Don't leave me to die, 
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies. 

Make me feel this love we used to hold, 
All I see is black and cold, 
As I try to pull you down to the ground, the ground. 

Everybody's gotta breathe somehow, 
Don't leave me to die, 
You're too consumed by all your emptiness inside. 

You bury me alive, 
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow, 
Don't leave me to die, 
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies. 

You bury me alive, 
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow, 
Don't leave me to die, 
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies.---Lyrics submitted by Nikki.
