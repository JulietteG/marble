I can feel your fingers when I close my eyes 
Take your poison love inside 
I fall into dreaming 
I've been waiting for your touch to bring me home 
Sleeping, death will come and lead me out of the sunlight 

Shadows pulling me along with you 
When the moonlight sings 
The darkness brings me back to die with you 
I'd give it all away to be with you 
My heart's waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight 

Hating all I am when lying by your side 
Taking everything of me 
To leave only nothing 

I hold secrets only dreaming eyes can see 
Night time sanctuary seeks 
The pain of the living 

Shadows pulling me along with you 
When the moonlight sings 


The darkness brings me back to die with you 
I'd give it all away to be with you 
My heart's waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight 

Lay down your life 
Only for you 

Forsake the light 
All I see is you 

Forever night 
Live just to die for you 

Shadows pulling me along with you 
When the moonlight sings 
The darkness brings me back to die with you 
I'd give it all away to be with you 
My heart's waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight---Lyrics submitted by Nikki.
