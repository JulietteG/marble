Do you see me, I stand before your eyes 
here in pieces, let me in your mind 
when did love fade, why are we at war, 
where did we fall, where did we go wrong, 
have we lost it all? 

Oh I let you go to feel the light outside 
Oh I without you I just feel 
I just feel so alive 

I can define where the well ran dry 
I remember every tear I cried 
memories of lies, wasted all this time 
now we've lost it all 

Oh I let you go to feel the light outside 
Oh I without you I just feel so alive 
There must be more to life 

Than I just left behind 
Oh I without you I just feel 
I just feel so alive 

I step into sunlight 
fueled by rage and delight 
There's no place for weakness 
Ill forget your sweet kiss 

Oh I let you go to feel the light outside 
Oh I without you I just feel so alive 
There must be more to life 
Than I just left behind 
Oh I without you I just feel 
I just feel so alive.---Lyrics submitted by Nikki.
