You won't go away, 
These aching memories still dance around me, 
Spilling over everything with beauty, 
I see your face in everything before me 
Your voice is hunting me. 

Oh I belong with you now, 
Oh please give in to me, 
And stay forever, 
Don't leave me behind. 

So afraid of dreaming, 
The story is repeating, screaming, 
Monsters, I'm bleeding, 
I'm losing light in myself, 

Come back into me, 'cause only you can save me. 

I belong with you now, 
Oh please give in to me, 
And stay forever, 
Don't leave me behind. 

I belong with you now, 
Oh please give in to me, 
And stay forever, 
Don't leave me behind.---Lyrics submitted by Nikki.
