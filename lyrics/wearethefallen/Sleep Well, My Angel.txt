Watching you sleep for so long,
Knowing that I can't turn the rain into sun 
Anymore
I've given you all that I am
Now I stand here 
Too scared to hold your hand
Afraid you might wait to see
The monster that had to leave

Cause you see the shelter as the storm,
Holding wind to keep you warm
You were everything to me,
This is why I have to leave

So sleep well, my angel

Under the ash of the lies,
Something beautiful once here now dies
And the tears burn my eyes
As you sit there all alone

I just want to come home

But you see the shelter as the storm,
Holding wind to keep you warm
You were everything to me,
This is why I have to leave

So sleep well, my angel
Sleep well, my angel

I'm sorry (x4)

You see the shelter as the storm, 
Holding wind to keep you warm
You were everything to me,
This is why

You see the shelter as the storm,
Holding wind to keep yo warm
You were everything to me,
This is why I have to leave

So sleep well, my angel
Sleep well, my angel---Lyrics submitted by Elaine.
