Yeaaaaahhh
Yeaaaaahhh
Yeaaaaahhh

Insane, won't let you drive me insane
Already on the border line I can't turn more crazy
Noo
You've change
Why did I ever rearrange
My whole entire life with you
But you don't Invest in me
Noo

I been runnin miles around my head tryin to figure out was it something I did
But you made it now so evident your no damn good for me
You made love you from a distance
This was the last thing I wanted
I'm missin you babe but I'm so over it
Only way to get back to me

Is love you from a distance
Love you from a distance
Love you from a distance

Ahh yeahhh
Yeahh

Lately your sayin that you want me back
I think your so ridiculous
Your so Inconsistent
Ohhh
Spare me
Not wasting no more energy
Cause everytime you take one step forward you jump ten back
From here

I been runnin miles around my head tryin to figure out was it something I did
But you made it now so evident your no damn good for me
You made love you from distance
This was the last thing I wanted
I'm missin you babe but I'm so over it
Only way to get back to me

Is love you from a distance
Love you from a distance
Love you from a distance

Ahh yeahhh
Yeahh

Sleepin
Your havin trouble dreamin
One night you can't relate to half the pain you given me.
Yeaaah

Yeaaaaahhh
Yeaaaaahhh
Yeaaaaahhh

You made love you from a distance
This was the last thing I wanted
I'm missin you babe but I'm so over it
Only way to get back to me

You made love you from a distance
This was the last thing I wanted
I'm missin you babe but I'm so over it
Only way to get back to me

Is love you from a distance---Lyrics submitted by Ksenia.
