So kind, is the others.
Of the change in the wind.
The watchtower man,
Turned and whispered,
Me somethings.
Said we don't sleep,
Stuck in a dream.
Shot my babe with an arrow, in the wind.

Put it, cut, bend and skirt. We got together.

Lost the love,
In the broke down cut,
Through stormy weather.

So kind, is the others,
Of the change in the wind.
The lighthouse man,
Turn and whispered,
Me somethings ,
We don't sleep,
Awake in a dream.
Shot my babe with an arrow,
In the rain.
Us, you, me and them. We got together.

Like the bird
