Follow me, follow me you know, that I could be the one for you
I could save you from your hurt,
You could leave this crazy Earth
When societys too dirty for your dreams
And youre unhappy with your day-to-day life,
You could be my other half

Id sing for you
Youd sing for me
And the distance is not true
When we know its me and you
Id sing for you
Youd sing for me
Wed be sharing all and more
We would love without discord

Leave a town, leave a town of fear
Your enemies are hiding near
Mountains are our empty spaces, there will be no one wholl say
I got to work Im growing old
And all Im looking for is gold
There youll hear the silence sing
I swear its a perfect thing

Id sing for you
Youd sing for me
And the distance is not true
When we know its me and you

Id sing for you
Youd sing for me
Wed be sharing all and more
We would love without discord

Just the two of us lost somewhere in the US
Would be a dream come true
Ill ride the train, the bus, take a plane Ill never stop
Just to be with you

Id sing for you
Youd sing for me
And the distance is not true, when we know its me and you
Id sing for you
Youd sing for me
And the distance is not true, when we know its me and you
Id sing for you
Youd sing for me
Wed be sharing all and more
We would love without discord
Id sing for you
Youd sing for me
And the distance is not true, when we know its me and you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
