You keep pushing me away 
In spite of what you say
I found out yesterday 
That I've been wasting all my time
Trying to make you smile
Trying to make this seem worth while
You've been pushing me around
In spite of what I do 
Trying to make things good for you

Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away
(Hey hey)

You've been racing through my mind
You're picking up in speed
You're driving recklessly
It's like a car crash happening on my street
Broken bodies at my feet
And sirens on the way
They're too late
'Cause nobody's going to save us
We're a rubbernecker's dream
We're burning gasoline

Go take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away
(Hey hey)

And go
Go ahead and destroy this
Better come with an army
Are you feeling, feeling okay baby?
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away
(Hey hey)---Lyrics submitted by Bethany.
