Hey!

Hey!
I am an opera singer,
I stand n painted tape!

It tells me where I'm going and where to through my cape.
I call my co-stars brother, I call my co-stars nammme!

I play both good and evil parts,
I sing two very sway!

And every single morning, by ten a.m. I'm dressed,
My rehearsals last for hours and hours, with diligents have been blessed!!

Some people call me monster, some people they call me saint!
my tallent feeds my darker side, yet no one will commmmplllaaaiiinnn!

[corus]
I am an opera singggerrr!
I sing in foreign landddss!

I've sung for Cage be Uara!
And Emperors in Japannn!!

Ya!

And after each preformance, people stand around and wait,
just to tell me that they loved my voice, just to tell me that I'm great!!

I am an opera singer!
I'll sing when your all dead,
I sing the mountians crummbling apart,
I sing what can't bbbbbbeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee said!!!!

[corus]
I am an opera singer!
I sing in foreign lands!

Most people seem to know my name,
Or at least know who I aaaammmm!!

Hey!
Hey!
Ohhhhh!
Ya!---Lyrics submitted by Kat.
