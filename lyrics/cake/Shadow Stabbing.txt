Adjectives on the typewriter
He moves his words like a prizefighter
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell

The man on the street might just as well be
The man on the street might just as well
The man on the street might just as well be

Outside, outside the world
Out there you don't hear the echoes and calls
But the steel eye, tight jaw,
Say it all, say it all
But the white paint, plastic saints
Say it all, say it all, say it all

Say it all (say it all)
Say it all (say it all)
Say it all (say it all)
Say somebody's got to say it all
Somebody's got to say it all

I'm so nervous, I'm so tense
My heart can't forget about this self defense
The air is so hot and my breath comes fast
I thumb the cool blade but I know this can't last
I thumb the cool blade but I know this can't last

Outside, outside the world
Out there you don't hear the echoes and calls
But the steel eye, tight jaw
Say it all, say it all
But the white paint, plastic saints
Say it all, say it all, say it all

Say it all (say it all)
Say it all (say it all)
Say it all (say it all)

Say somebody's got to say it all
Somebody's got to say it all

Adjectives on the typewriter
He moves his words like a prize fighter
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell

The man on the street might just as well be
The man on the street might just as well
The man on the street might just as well be---Lyrics submitted by claudia.
