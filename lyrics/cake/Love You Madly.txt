I dont want to wonder 
If this is a blunder
I dont want worry whether
We'er gonna stay together till we die
I dont want to jump in unless this musics stomping
All the dishes rattle in the cuboards when the elephant's arrive

I want to love you madly 
I want to love you now 
I want to love you madly, way
I want to love you, love you, love you madly

I dont want to fake it
I just want to make it
The ornaments look pretty 
But their pulling down the branches of the tree
I dont to think about it 
I dont want to talk about it
When i kiss your lips 
I want to sink down to the bottom of the sea

I want to love you madly 
I want to love you now, yeah
I want to love you madly, way
I want to love you, love you, love you madly

I dont want to hold back 
I dont want to slip down
I dont want to think back to the one thing
That I know i should have done
I dont want to doubt you know everything about you
I dont want to sit across the table from you wishing i could run

I want to love you madly 
I want to love you now 
I want to love you madly, way
I want to love you, love you, love you madly---Lyrics submitted by Zac.
