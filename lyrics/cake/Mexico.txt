I had a match, but she had a lighter.
I had a flame, but she had a fire.
I was bright, but she was much brighter.
I was high, but she was the sky.
Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico...

Oh baby, I was bound to let you go...

I don't know much about Cinco de Mayo.
I'm never sure what it's all about,
but I say: "I want you."
And you don't believe me.

You say you want me,
but I've got my doubts.

Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico...
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go...

I had a match, but she had a lighter.
I had a flame, but she had a fire.
I was bright, but she was much brighter.
I was high, but she was the sky.
Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico...

Oh baby, I was bound to let you go.....---Lyrics submitted by Steven.
