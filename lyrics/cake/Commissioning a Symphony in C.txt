So you'll be Austrian nobleman
Commissioning a symphony in "C"
Which defies all Earthly descriptions
You'll be commissioning a symphony in "C"

With money you squeeze from the peasants
to your nephew you can give it as a present
This magnificent symphony in "C"
You'll be commissioning a symphony in "C"

Completely filling the palace concert hall
It's warm and golden like an oven that's wide open
It has a melody both happy and sad
Built on victorious young triads

You enter the room with great caution
Though no one in the hall is even watching
They are transfixed they are forgeting just to breathe
They are so taken by your symphony in "C"

You are sitting there thinking your thoughts 
They are not about what is but what is not
You are sitting there breathing in your breath
You are seldom breathing life but mostly death

So you'll be an Austrian nobleman
Commissioning a symphony in "C"
Which defies all Earthly descriptions
You are commissioning a symphony in "C"---Lyrics submitted by Eli.
