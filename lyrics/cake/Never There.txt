I need your arms around me, I need to feel your touch
I need your understanding, I need your love so much
You tell me that you love me so, you tell me that you care
But when I need you (BABY) baby, youre never there

On the phone long, long distance
Always through such strong resistance
First you say youre too busy
I wonder if you even miss me

Never there
Youre never there
Youre never, ever, ever, ever there

A golden bird that flies away, a candles fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday, your love was just a game
A golden bird that flies away, a candles fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday, your love was just a game

You tell me that you love me so, you tell me that you care
But when I need you (BABY) baby
Take the time to get to know me
If you want me why cant you just show me
Were always on this roller coaster
If you want me why cant you get closer?

Never there
Youre never there
Youre never ever ever ever there---Lyrics submitted by MELISSA.
