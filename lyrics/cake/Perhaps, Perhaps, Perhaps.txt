You wont admit you love me.
And so how am I ever to know?
You only tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

A million times I ask you,
And then I ask you over again.
You only answer
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

If you cant make your mind up,
Well never get started.
And I dont wanna wind up
Being parted, broken-hearted.
So if you really love me,
Say yes.
But if you dont, dear, confess.
And please dont tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

If you cant make your mind up,
Well never get started.
And I dont wanna wind up
Being parted, broken-hearted.
So if you really love me,
Say yes.
But if you dont, dear, confess.
And please dont tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps,
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps,
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
