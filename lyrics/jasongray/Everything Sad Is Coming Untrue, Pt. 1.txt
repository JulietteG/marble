In the way the shadows hide
When the sun begins to rise 
And in the way the world comes alive 
At the first hint of spring
The frozen rivers run 
The death of winter comes undone 
Whispers of kingdom come 
While the bluebird sings 

Everything 
Everything that i thought i knew 
Everything 
Everything sad is coming untrue 

From the war torn city streets 
To the trash the slum dogs eat 
It seems so hard to believe
And meaningless to pray 
But in Rwanda's killing fields 
Forgiveness blooms and heals 
And the power of love reveals 
The Kingdom come today as... 
(repeat chorus above) 

Life is coming alive 
Death is destined to die 
But love... 

When we learn to live again
And let forgiveness win
There's no wound that love won't mend 
And finally redeem 
The son of god woke in the  ground 
The angel laid the soldiers down 
To bring the king his crown 
Oh, I believe
(Repeat chorus)---Lyrics submitted by austin.
