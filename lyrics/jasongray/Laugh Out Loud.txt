I shake my head at my good fortune
As I shake the dust off of my boots
Yesterday I was an orphan
Somehow today I belong to You
Somehow today I belong to You

Ha ha, don't it make you wanna laugh out loud?
Ooh ooh, and shout, "Hallelujah!"
Oh yeah, if you got joy go and let it on out
Ha ha ha ha, laugh out loud

I was alive but I wasn't living
A prisoner of my fear and shame
But when you find you've been forgiven
Laughter will rise like a holy kind of praise
So I throw my head back and offer up my thanks!

Ha ha, don't it make you wanna laugh out loud?
Ooh ooh, and shout, "Hallelujah!"
Oh yeah, if you got joy go and let it on out
Ha ha ha ha

He said bring to me your heavy heart
Take my hand and we'll go whistling in the dark
Here we go now!

Ha ha, don't it make you wanna laugh out loud?
Ooh ooh, and shout, "Hallelujah!"
Oh yeah, if you got joy go and let it on out
Ha ha ha ha, laugh out loud

Ha ha, don't it make you wanna laugh out loud?
Ooh ooh, and shout, "Hallelujah!"
Oh yeah, if you got joy go and let it on out
Ha ha ha ha, laugh out loud

Ha ha ha ha, laugh out loud ---
