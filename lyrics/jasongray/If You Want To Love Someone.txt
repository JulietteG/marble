If you want to love someone
Search their soul for where it's broken
Find the cracks and pour your heart in
If you want to love someone

In every heart there is a hollow
Locked against the pain it's known
If there's a key, the key is sorrow
Only a trusted hand can hold

If you want to love someone
Search their soul for where it's broken
Find the cracks and pour your heart in
If you want to love someone

The heart will hide where it's been broken
But the fault lines still remain
Like a map to lead you home when
You can enter through their pain

If you want to love someone
Search their soul for where it's broken
Find the cracks and pour your heart in
If you want to love someone

Somehow You had a way of seeing
Just how deep my wound could go
Oh but You were never scared
To run and meet me there
And that's how I know

If you want to love someone
Search their soul for where it's broken
Find the cracks and pour your heart in
That's what You did
If you want to love someone---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
