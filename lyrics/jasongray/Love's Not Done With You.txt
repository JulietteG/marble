They say nothing really shuts you down
Quite like shame, it kicks you when you're on the ground
Even with your good intentions
You always seem to lose against it
But love is taking it away now

It's not what you've done, it's what His love is doing
It's not who you were, it's who you are becoming
Have you heard that He makes all things new
I believe His love's not done with you

They say people never really change
But I, I don't really feel that way
Everything's redeemable
The God I know is capable
And this is a new day

It's not what you've done, it's what His love is doing
It's not who you were, it's who you are becoming
Have you heard that He makes all things new
I believe His love's not done with you

Hey, love has conquered all your shame
I know you got things that you regret
But your story isn't over yet
It doesn't matter where you've been, don't forget

It's not what you've done, it's what His love is doing
It's not who you were, it's who you are becoming
Have you heard that He makes all things new
I believe His love's not done with you, no no
His love's not done with you

Have you heard that He makes all things new
I believe His love's not done with you, no no---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
