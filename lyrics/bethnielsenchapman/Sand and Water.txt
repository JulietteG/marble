All Alone Now Didn't like the feeling
All Alone I Sat and cried
All Alone I Had to find some meaning 
In the center of the pain I felt inside
All Alone I Came into this world
All Alone I will someday die
Solid Stone is just SAND AND WATER Baby
SAND AND WATER and a million years gone by

Chorous:
I will see you in the light of the clouds insight
I will hear you in the sound of the waves
I will know you when I come as we all will come 
Through the doors beyond the grave

All Alone I Heal this heart of sorrow
All Alone I Raise this child
Flesh and bones he's just bursting towards tomorrow
And his laughter fills my world and wears your smile

Repeat Chorous:

All Alone I Came into this world
All Alone I will someday die
Solid stone is just SAND AND WATER baby
SAND AND WATER and a million years gone by.---Lyrics submitted by Cory.
