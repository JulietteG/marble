Pinch me i must be dreamin wakin up with you and feelin the tender touch of your good morning kiss nowhere else on earth is better than bein next to you next to heaven it doesn't get any better than this 

(chorus)
next to heaven lies my fate my best friend and my soul mate god knows this kind of love only comes from up above your the answer to my prayers oh nothing else compares cause im next to heaven when im next to you

and you look just like an angel tangeled in white satin sheets lying there with your hair all in a mess i swear you look your best all dressed up and next to nothin next to heaven it doesn't get any better than this 

(chorus) X3

Cause Im next to heaven---Lyrics submitted by Patricia.
