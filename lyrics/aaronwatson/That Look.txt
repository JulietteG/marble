She keeps it all together
I always come unwound
She's cool calm and collected
I wanna paint the town
She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a dancehall Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a lonestar neon light
She has another side
That no one sees but me
She is the only one
That brings me to my knees
There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away

When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look

She sparkles like a diamond
She twinkles like a star
She's like a ray of sunshine
That always melts my heart
And when I'm feeling empty
Her love makes me whole
Just like a country breeze
That soothes my weary soul

When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that

Slow dancin'
Romancin'
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but her beautiful smile
She's up to something
Wearin' nothin' but a beautiful smile

When she gets that look in her eyes
When she gets that want you
Need to love you
Right now that kind of look in her eyes
She's always lookin' so fine
That I can't believe mine
And when those stars align
Just add a little white wine
And moonlight and that girl's off the hook
When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look

When she's good she's good
But even better when she gets that look

There's something about Sinatra
And a bottle of Chardonnay
Without a single word
She takes my breath away

She's like a Sunday morning
I'm a Saturday night
She's like a stain glass window
I'm a neon light---
