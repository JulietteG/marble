Well God bless Texas and Deacon Shackleford
He read the Bible seven times
He believed every word 
That old beat up leather book had been through it all
He sat on the back pew so he could chew him a chaw
Singing Amazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
He carried candy for the kids
In his Sunday dress coat
He'd take me fishing after church and 
Taught me things I needed to know
No Deacon didn't have a family
Lord knows he wished he did
He told the whole congregation, I was his grandkid

**Chorus**
And today he joined up with Jesus
Wearing shiny pearl snaps 
We sang a few gospel hyms
And the soldier played taps
I bet he's walking with Pete
Down the street paved with gold
Showing off his brand spankin new wings
And his barbed wire halo

He married sweet Emma Grace
Before the war was through
She held his right arm
Next to his anchor tattoo
He was on a ship off at sea
When she died in child birth
He lost his whole world from
The far side of the Earth
He lost the will to love and 
He lost the will to live
Until he met a man who taught
Him to forgive
Yeah, life took him to hell and back
To hell and back a time or two
But in the end he beat the devil
Until he was black and blue
Singing, I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

**Chorus**

Before he went he made me promise him
That I wouldn't cry, and though I told him I wouldn't
I couldn't help but to lie because

**Chrous**

As sure as the old church bell still rings
He always said had country in his soul
He's showin off his brand spankin new wings
And his barbed wire halo

Sweet Chariot
Oh come in forth to carry me home
Swing low, Sweet Chariot
Come in forth to carry me home---Lyrics submitted by Kyndell.
