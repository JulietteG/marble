First kiss, I thought I died and gone to heaven
In the parking lot of that old 7/11
I filled up a truck
I went into pay
When I walked out
She was with him smiling
As she drove away

I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball
With a sexy southern draw
Is gonna tear my world apart

And I know just like a moth draw to a flame
I'll come running when she whispers my name
And like a tattoo on my heart
I know that's gonna leave a mark

If you play with fire
You're bound to get burned
You would think by now
That I would've learned
But she's looking so hot
So what can I say
My mama said don't
But I did it anyway

Oh, tug on 'em heartstrings now

I wish she didn't look so dang good
I wish she wouldn't smile at me that way
There's an exit light shining brighter than the sun
Like a sign from above telling me to run away

And like a tattoo on my heart
I know she's gonna leave a mark---
