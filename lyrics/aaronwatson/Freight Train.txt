I'm gonna give 'em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor
Like an outlaw boy on the day before
Got the pretty girls out there begging for more
Gotta give 'em all what they came here for
Doing my thing singing my song
Right on track I'm chugging along
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train

On a wing and a prayer
And a glorified Greyhound bus
Flying down the road
Running 9-0 and kicking up dust
Drinking truck stop coffee
counting birds on those telephone wires
Burning the midnight oil
And the tread off these old Goodyear tires

And sometimes my mind is a million miles away
I know you're sound asleep at home
While I'm on this stage
And I'm missing you
Wishing I was kissing you everyday
But girl I gotta keep rolling
Rolling like an old freight train

And it's a mighty lonesome sound
When there's not a soul around
To help you ease your pain
But you gotta keep rolling
Rolling like an old freight train

Coming on down the line
Feel that diesel engine whine
Smell the smoke stack
Hear the gears grind full steam ahead
Halfway out of my mind
I'm too far gone to be turning back
Going clickity clack down the railroad tracks
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train

Just like an old freight train
Tell me do you wanna ride this train?---
