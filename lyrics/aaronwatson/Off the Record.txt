I got a letter from your lawyer you got one from mine. 
They both say it's gonna be final, once we sign that dotted line. 
Well I guess we'll get our freedom, and a so called fresh new start,
when you take half of everything you'll be takin' half my heart.
Our love got lost somewhere in lifes complications, torn between two lawyers 
and all their legal litigations. 

Off the record there's something I need to say to you, this aint easy but it's what my heart has to do. Cause I cant let you go until i let you know, off the record well im stilll in love with you.

I took down our wedding picture from above the fireplace,
and I stood there awhile staring at your pretty face.
Have we lost our love, the diffrences we can't resolve.
I guess if push comes to shove thank God no children are involved.
 Girl I can still see you throwing your rose bouque, never thought  i'd see the day we'd throw it all away.

Off the record something I need to say to you, this aint easy but its what my heart has to do. Cause I cant let you go until I let you know off the record well im still in love with you.

I've done all I can do all I can do is pray, and ask the Good Lord to let me hear you say,
Off the record there's something I need to say to you this aint easy, but it's what my heart has to do Cause I cant let you go until I let you know off the record well im still in love with you.
Girl off the record well im still in love with you.---Lyrics submitted by Patricia.
