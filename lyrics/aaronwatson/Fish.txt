He broke your heart and he tore your dreams in two,
and he kissed a bottom feedin' sucker fish in front of you,
you knew it was never gonna last,
'cause he's a piece of stinkbait always actin' like a bass
and now you're thinkin' your ship is slowly sinkin'
stayin' up all night long drownin' in your drinkin'
before you give up get your rear back in the water,
dance a jig, jitter bug, or tie on a hoolapopper

Then you throw out a line,
reel it back in,
if you catch a boot,
you gotta cast it out again,
you know you'll never catch a keeper,
if you sit around and cry,
so get back in that boat and fish.

Now you heard the girl he's kissin' is stirrin' up awake,
sayin', "She held you good and threw you right back in the lake."
just remember what your momma said about sticks and rocks,
even though you'd like to smack her with your metal tacklebox. 

You gotta throw out a line,
reel it back in,
if you catch a boot,
you gotta cast it out again,
you know you'll never catch a keeper,
if you sit around and cry,
so get back in that boat and fish.

So don't say farewell to forever,
like "happy everafter" ain't ever gonna work,
don't you throw the towel in,
the last one you drug in,
was just the state record breakin' large mouth jerk

You gotta throw out a line,
reel it back in,
if you catch a boot,
you gotta cast it out again,
you know you'll never catch a keeper,
if you sit around and cry,
so get back in that boat and fish.

And throw out a line,
reel it back in,
if you catch a boot,
you gotta cast it out again,
you know you'll never catch a keeper,
if you sit around and cry,
so get back in that boat and fish.

yeah, get back in that boat and fish
girl, get back in that boat and fish.---Lyrics submitted by Race Southworth.
