Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck
Granny's fried chicken and her sweet tea
Now that's a bittersweet memory

The old tire swing where my little boys play
Well, that was me only yesterday
Doing double back flips off the branch and the tank
Kissing on you and fishing from the bank

We had some good times, got through the bad times
Sounds of laughter always covers up the sad times
Strong as an oak, solid as a hickory
That's a love made in the shade of my family tree

Pass down from my granny and my grandpa
Mom and daddy kept it safe, kept it sturdy and tall
Summers were hot, winters were long
But our roots are deep and our faith is strong
Now some are gone, and some are grown
You and me, baby, branch out on our own
Every sunset comes another sunrise
I can see my daddy in our little boys eyes

Lost love once through out the years
Never there smile and dry those tears
'Cause they live on in your heart and mind
Little love grow like a country vine

Made in the shade of my family tree

Sunday afternoon church potluck
George Jones blaring from my grandpa's truck

A family that raised together
Is family that stays together
Love the Lord like God and Savior
All your heart and love thy neighbor---
