Don't you ever let this world push you around
Use your head and keep your feet firmly on the ground
If you get knocked down, get back up and try again
And don't you ever lose that sparkle in your eyes
Don't bottle up your passion like a jar of fireflies
If you ever lose sight of the light
And you feel like giving in

Don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love

When you fear, when you fail
When you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog

Don't buy a thing unless you can pay in cash
Go ahead and throw those credit cards in the trash
Love is a virtue, honesty is the key
Say your prayers, brush your teeth
Don't you watch too much TV

If you're down in the count one strike away
Choke up and crowd the plate
And put the ball in play
Keep your nose down when you win
Keep your head up when you lose
And you're gonna lose

And there will come a day
When I will fly away
So make me smile while we're apart
You gotta sing from your soul
And play with all of your heart

There's a good chance your heart will break in two
Trust that God has someone special planned for you
Did you know I was down on love and luck
When he sent your mom to me?

Someday you'll have babies of your own
So cherish every moment
You're gonna blink and they'll be grown
The greatest honor that I've ever had
Is having you call me your dad---
