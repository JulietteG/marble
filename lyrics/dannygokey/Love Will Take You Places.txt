It'll stop you right in your tracks
Take a breath and change your path
Two roads you thought you'd never go down
Through highs and lows and endless nights
Through fire and darkness and to the light
Bring you to your knees, take your feet right off the ground
Once it takes hold, it won't let you go
But it alway's sets you free

Love will stand in the place of the one who's guilty
Gives a voice to those who can't speak
Take a bullet, take the fall
Walk on water, make a part
Breathe in lovin' to a broken heart
When you love it, turn the pages
Love will take you places

It can make you plant your stakes
Pick em up and move them worlds away
Livin' life bigger then you've ever dreamed
It can take all that you've got
But ... like a river that never stops
Running through your heart if you dare believe

Love will stand in the place of the one who's guilty
Gives a voice to those who can't speak
Take a bullet, take the fall
Walk on water, make a part
Breathe in lovin' to a broken heart
When you love it, turn the pages
Love will take you places
Love will take you places

Take me higher, take me farther
Take me to where I never been

Love will stand for the guilty
And give a voice to those who can't speak
Hooooooo
Love will, love will

Won't you let it take you places
Through the fire through the night
Awhhhh let love take you places---
