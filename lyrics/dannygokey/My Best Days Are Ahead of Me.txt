Blowin' out the candles on another birthday cake,
Old enough to look back and laugh at my mistakes,
Young enough to look at the future and like what i see,
My best days are ahead of me,

Life hasn't always been a party,
But mostly its been good,
There's only one or two things,
That I'd change if I could,
I don't get lost in the past,
or get stuck in some sad memory,
My best days are ahead of me

Chorus:x2
Age ain't nothin' but a number,
Sometimes I have to wonder,
What does it really mean
And hey I'm still putting it together,
I keep getting better, if I keep getting better,
I can be whatever I want to be,
My best days are ahead of me

I've got sunsets to witness,
Dreams to dance with,
Beaches to walk on,
and lovers to kiss,
There's a whole lotta world out there,
that I cant wait to see,
My best days are ahead of me

My best days are ahead of me---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
