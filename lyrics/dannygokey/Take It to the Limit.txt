If you want to be free, we gotta jump in and let it all go 
If I will never die without naming the sky like there's no tomorrow 

Break through everything that's been holding you 
(Take it to the limit, take it to the limit) 
Let this feeling take you beyond the moon 
(Take it to the limit, take it to the limit) 

Take it to the limit, we gon light it up, gon hold it up, gon burn it up 
We don't have to fake it, we can change the game, won't stay the same 
Let this feeling take you beyond the moon, whoa 
(Take it to the limit) 

Girl if you feel like you wanna (take it to the limit) 
Girl...if you gonna (take it to the limit) 
I'll break the chains so you can (take it to the limit) 
Take it to the limit 

I know this is our moment, there's an explosion ready to blow 
Tonight we'll jump on the ride, never felt so alive as we got in our soul 

Break through everything that's been holding you 
(Take it to the limit, take it to the limit) 
Let this feeling take you beyond the moon 
(Take it to the limit, take it to the limit) 

Take it to the limit, we gon light it up, gon hold it up, gon burn it up 
We don't have to fake it, we can change the game, won't stay the same 
Let this feeling take you beyond the moon, whoa 
(Take it to the limit) 

Girl if you feel like you wanna (take it to the limit) 
Girl...if you gonna (take it to the limit) 
I'll break the chains so you can (take it to the limit) 
Take it to the limit 

We're gonna take it to the limit 
I'll take you there, said I'll take you there 
We're gonna take it to the limit 
Come jump on this train, come ride, we won't be the same 

Take it to the limit, we gon light it up, gon hold it up, gon burn it up 
We don't have to fake it, we can change the game, won't stay the same 
Let this feeling take you beyond the moon 
(Take it to the limit, take it to the limit) 
Let this feeling take you beyond the moon 
(Take it to the limit) 

Girl if you feel like you wanna (take it to the limit) 
Girl...if you gonna (take it to the limit) 
I'll break the chains so you can (take it to the limit) 
Take it to the limit (take it to the limit) 
Girl if you feel like you wanna (take it to the limit) 
Girl...if you gonna (take it to the limit) 
I'll break the chains so you can (take it to the limit) 
Take it to the limit---
