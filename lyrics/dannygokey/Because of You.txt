It's amazing how the simple ordinary suddenly is upside down 
I can't find the words, but everything is different 
Yeah, you came and changed my world around 

And what do I say to try to explain? 

It's like the stars in the sky even shine a little brighter 
I'm blazing like a fire because of you 
I'm awake, I'm alive, held inside your love forever 
The good keeps getting better because of you 
Ooh, because of you, ooh 

Your amazing love can put me back together 
When I think all hope is gone 
It's incredible knowing you are with me 
It gives me strength to keep moving on 

And what do I say to try to explain? 

It's like the stars in the sky even shine a little brighter 
I'm blazing like a fire because of you 
I'm awake, I'm alive, held inside your love forever 
The good keeps getting better because of you 
Ooh, because of you, ooh 

You've got me feeling, feeling 
Oh you've got me feeling things I've never, never 
Never felt before 
Oh God just made me, change me 
Everything I am is yours 

Because of you 
Because of you, whoa 

It's like the stars in the sky even shine a little brighter 
I'm blazing like a fire because of you 
I'm awake, I'm alive, held inside your love forever 
The good keeps getting better because of you 
Ooh, because of you 
Ooh, because of you 
Ooh, because of you 
Ooh, because of you 

(Because of you)---
