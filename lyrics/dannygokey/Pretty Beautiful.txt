There's something about you, you're every move 
Is like the sun comes up just to shine on you 
You're a wildflower in a world of weeds 
Ain't no doubt about it, you were hand picked just for me 

Oh baby you, turn gray to blue 
Yeah, what you do is wonderful, wonderful 
Don't you know, oh you're so beautiful, beautiful 
You make pretty beautiful 
Oh, you're beautiful 

No, it ain't what you wearing, those diamond eyes 
It's a love that you carry so deep inside 
Like a mist in the morning, or the midnight rain 
You're the love that I want, I want falling down on me 

Oh baby you, turn gray to blue 
Yeah, what you do is wonderful, wonderful 
Don't you know, oh you're so beautiful, beautiful 
You make pretty beautiful 

Baby, you're the one in a million 
No, you're the only one that's ever been so beautiful 

You're, you're, you're so beautiful 
You're, you're, you're so beautiful 

Oh baby you, turn gray to blue 
Yeah, what you do is wonderful, wonderful 
Don't you know, oh you're so beautiful, beautiful 
You make pretty beautiful---
