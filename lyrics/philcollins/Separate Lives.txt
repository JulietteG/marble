You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were
Leaving so soon, and that you miss me sometimes
When you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
I can't go on, just holding on to ties
Now that we're living (Living) Separate Lives

Well I held on to let you go, Ooh
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (Living)
Separate Lives

Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall
(Build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall
(Build that wall)
And you make it stronger

Well you have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Some day I might (I might) find myself looking in your eyes

But for now, we'll go on living Separate Lives
Yes for now, we'll go on living Separate Lives

Separate lives---
