Just as I thought it was goin' alright
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
Its always the same its just a shame that's all
I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me its black when I know that it's white
It's always the same its just a shame that's all

I could leave but I wont go, though my heart might tell me so
I cant feel a thing from my head down to my toes

Why does it always seem to be
Me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me
Its always the same its just a shame that's all
Turnin' me on, turnin' me off
Makin' me feel like I want too much
Livin' with you is justa puttin' me through it all of the time

Runnin' around stayin' out all night
Takin it all stead of takin' one bite
Livin' with you is justa puttin' me through it all the time

I could leave but I wont go
But it'd be easier I know
I cant feel a thing from my head down to my toes

Why does it always seem to be
Me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me
It's always the same its just a shame that's all

Truth is I love you, more then I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together til the end

I could leave but I wont go
It would be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

So why does it always seem to be
Me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me
It's always the same its just a shame that's all

But I love you, more then I wanted to
There's no point in trying to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together til the end

But just as I thought it was goin' alright
I found out I'm wrong when thought I was right
Its always the same its just a shame that's all
Well I can say day, you'd say night
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same it's just a shame that's all
That's all---
