I was late for work last night cause some jerk ran a red light.
He cut me off and I had to stop.
All I could do was curse him out and give him the finger.
You know I nearly lost my job
	But why am I telling you?  This is nothing new....this stuff happens every single day.

The kids I used to go to school with all have summer beach houses.....
.....mostly cause their daddies cheated on their income tax.
My poor old man had to work two jobs for 35 years.
I aint crying, man, these are the facts.
	But why am I telling you?  This is nothing new....this stuff happens every single day.

		Everyone breaks the rules (3x).....so now: Im gonna break some too....

Saw some guilty mutha get put back out on the street.....
.....because of some jive technicality.
Free to rape and free to kill and free to steal your livelihood.
Hey, man, it sucks but thats reality.
	But why am I telling you?  This is nothing new....this stuff happens every single day.

		Everyone breaks the rules (3x).....so now: Im gonna break some too....

	A lying politician, a priest wigged out on lust, what do they got in common?
						They all betrayed our trust..................
	Celebrities who broke the rules, how can they go scott-free?  
				How come these kind of breaks dont happen for you and me?

	(Because) Everyone breaks the rules (3x).....so now: Im gonna break some too....

Saw the son or daughter of someone famous - struttin their stuff last night on my T.V.
I guess nepotism can be a fabulous career move.
A door-stops got more talent but, somehow, theyre celebrities.........
If theres an angle, baby, you bet Ill use it.
You wont see me hesitate from the guilt.
Ill do what I have to do - and you can go get screwed.
Lifes taught me to kill or get killed.
	But why am I telling you?  This is nothing new....this stuff happens every single day.

		Everyone breaks the rules (3x).....so now: Im gonna break some too....
		Everyone breaks the rules (3x).....so now: Im gonna break some too....
		Everyone breaks the rules (3x).....so now: Im gonna break some too....
(mm-Break them rules....ah, breaka-breaka-break them rules....oh yeah......)

		Everyone breaks the rules (8x).....so now: Im gonna break some too....---Lyrics submitted by Kenn.
