Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so well.....

He set the establishment on its ear, from Kent State to Chicago, might notve agreed with what he said.....
.....But still you had to listen.....
He did weird things to make you notice - long before the yuppies - but once the war was over, no one cared.....
.....And he joined the missing.....

Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so well.....
Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so well.....

And uniforms of tattered jeans give way to chic designer threads - and mineral spring water.....
.....Gets imported now from France.....
And voices from the inner city that once possessed an edge - are rappin instead of protesting.....
.....Oh wed rather all break-dance
						(let me hear ya)
Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so well.....
Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so well.....

	Oh Abbie - this whole world is different - than it was some 20-odd years ago.....
	Just when you felt that people were listening - the world grew cold - and you grew old.....

Abbie took his life in 89 - long after people stopped caring - what Mayor Daley couldnt kill.....
.....Abbie finnished off himself.....
And half the kids on campuses - couldnt tell you who the hell he was....Abbie Hoffmans dead.....
.....And I dont feel so well.........

Right after Abbie died the students through a protest - at first glance his spirit seemed emboddied
In this exhibition.....
The students thrust their collective fists - but Abbie wasnt smiling - the reason they had come together.....
.....Was to protest a raise in their tuition

	And Abbie - this whole world is different - than it was some 20-odd years ago.....
	Just when you felt that people were listening - the world grew cold - and you grew old.....
					(yeah, yeah, yeah....)
Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so well.....
Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so well.....
Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so well.....
Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel.....(Aaahhh)
            Abbie Hoffmans dead.....well now Abbie Hoffmans dead....Well now Abbie Hoffmans dead....Oh no 	.....Abbie Hoffmans dead..........noooo....nooooo.......

Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so welllll.....
Abbie Hoffmans dead - and I dont feel so good myself....Abbie Hoffmans dead - and - I - dont feel -  so -  well---Lyrics submitted by Kenn.
