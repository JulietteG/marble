Welcome to New York (8x).........

I got mugged last night on the subway and I told the cops only to find
Ive gotta take a number and get on at the back of the line
I got a cordless phone for 30 bucks from a guy on the corner of Avenue C
But a one-room walk-up costs 12-hundred bucks, explain that one to me.....
We give away condoms and the clinics are free, but you have to pay to cross the street...

Welcome to New York (8x).........

I always love the springtime when its gold-chain stealing season
Where manslaughter is just for kicks, you dont have to have a reason
Called 9-1-1 last week cause grandpa had a kidney stone
The operator hung up cause she didnt like my tone
The ambulance took two hours to show, we burried grandpa two days ago....

Welcome to New York (8x).........

The port authority stinks and the sewers explode, the cops rip you off when your car gets towed.......(and I LOVE it!).........

Just got off the Henry Hudson, it was backed up to the bridge
See the same guy bumming change each day since 1986
I hear theyre raising tolls again and the mayor just got a raise
Theres zip-gun packing school-kids and pot-holes all over the place...
Theyll tax you here and theyll fine you there, theres no place like it anywhere!

Welcome to New York (12x).........
I LOVE New York (2x).........
