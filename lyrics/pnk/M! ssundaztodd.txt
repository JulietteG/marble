I might be the way
Everybody likes to say
I know watcha thinking about me
There might be a day
You might have a certain way
But you don't have my luxuries
And it's me I know
I know my name 'cause I say it proud
Everything I want I always do
Lookin' for the right track
Always on the wrong track
But are you catchin' all these tracks
That I'm layin' down for you

There's a song I was listening to
Up all night
There's a voice I'm hearing
Saying it's alright
When I'm happy I am sad
But everything's good
It's not that complicated
I'm just misunderstood

There might be a day
Everything it goes my way
Can't you think I know I'm superfly
I might see a world
In a world inside of you
Then I might just say goodbye
And it's my name I know
I say it loud 'cause I'm really proud
Of all the things I used to do
Well it's the wrong track
Looking for the right track
And are you catchin' all these tracks
That I'm layin' down for you

And it's the wrong track
Looking for the right track
But are you catchin' all these tracks
That I'm layin' down for you
There's a song I was listening to
Up all night
There's a voice I am hearing
Saying it's alright
I was taken for granted
But it's all good
'Cause I'll do it again I'm just misunderstood
Yeah, I'll do it again I'm just misunderstood
Yeah, I'll do it again I'm just misunderstood
Yeah, I'll do it again I'm just misunderstood---Lyrics submitted by Rowynne.
