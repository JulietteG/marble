Ooooh
Ooooh
Are we all we are
Are we all we are

Cut to now holy wow 
When did everything become such a hell of a mess?
Maybe now maybe now
Can somebody come and take this off my chest?

I know you think it's not your problem
I know you think that god will solve them
But if your shit is not together it'll never be
You and me plant the seed
Open up and let it be

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of (rest of) Ooooh
We've had our fill 
We've had enough 
We've had it up to here
(Are we all we are are we all we are)

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of (rest of) Ooooh
Just sing it loud until the kids will sing it right back 
(Are we all we are are we all we are)

Ooooh
Ooooh
(Are we all we are are we all we are)

Seven seconds 
Seven seconds
That is all the time you got to make your point
My attention 
My attention's like an infant tryin' to crawl around this joint

I know we're better than the masses
But we're all followin' our asses
And if our shit is not together
It'll never be you and me 
Plant the seed 
Open up and let it be

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of (rest of) Ooooh
We've had our fill 
We've had enough 
We've had it up to here
(Are we all we are are we all we are)

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of (rest of) Ooooh
Just sing it loud until the kids will sing it right back 
(Are we all we are are we all we are)

Four, that's how many years it took me to get through the lesson
That I had to do it all on my own
Three, that's how many hail Mary's they would pray for me
Thinking I was gonna end up all alone
Two, for second chances that you've given me
Can it be lucky me lucky me, now let's go
One, it's what we are, it's what we are 
(Are we all we are are we all we are)

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of (rest of) Ooooh
We've had our fill 
We've had enough 
We've had it up to here
(Are we all we are are we all we are)

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of (rest of) Ooooh
Just sing it loud until the kids will sing it right back 
(Are we all we are are we all we are)

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of (rest of) Ooooh
We've had our fill 
We've had enough 
We've had it up to here
(Are we all we are are we all we are)

We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of (rest of) Ooooh
Cut to the future sing it loud and take the power back
(Are we all we are are we all we are)---Lyrics submitted by Sharon Janssen.
