Here comes, comes the weekend,
Hear it calling, like a siren (Ah-a-Ah-a)
We don't, want no problems
we don't like them, no--keep it movin'

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (Ah-a-Ah-a)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (Ah-a-Ah-a)

I just wanna play
big city, Holiday
so get out of my way, if you know whats better for ya (Ah-a-Ah-a)
I'm tearing up the night, lipstick and leather tight
not looking for a fight--no (Ah-a-Ah-a)

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We ticking like a bomb about to go (Ah-a-Ah-off)

Here comes, comes the weekend,
Hear it calling, like a siren (Ah-a-Ah-a)
We don't want no trouble
Just enough to seeing double 

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (Ah-a-Ah-a)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (Ah-a-Ah-a)

Drink some pink champagne
I don't know you yet, but will forget so
fuck-a-what they say
let them run the floor until it breaks

I'm tearing up the night, lipstick and leather tight
not looking for a fight--no(Ah-a-Ah-a)

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We ticking like a bomb about to go (Ah-a-Ah-off)

Here comes, comes the weekend,
Hear it calling, like a siren (Ah-a-Ah-a)
We don't look for trouble
Just enough to seeing double

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (Ah-a-Ah-a)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (Ah-a-Ah-a)

Another night class in my glass
Only bottles of pop, bottles of pop
So when I pop up in the spot
don't pop up, you not gonna be wanting you
pop bubble, you so rock--I'm not Puffy
But Ima run the city tonight, when I hit it
I might act like a freakin' idiot
Diddy mixed with a mini ignite
Big City lights little ambiguity-hot diggity
this Biggy is getting me hype.
If I don't get some nicker, I'll hurt you
I'm not digging the dirt
bickering worse than that bitch in the Snicker commercial
Mixture is different than Urkel
Hanging from the light fixture 
I hope you bring some insure
because this building we're tearing it down
Security-Get Out!--Freakin' wait 
D-Spice with the beer and it's loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound of sirens going
Ah-A-Ah-A!

Here comes the weekend
Set of your sirens
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (Ah-a-Ah-a)
