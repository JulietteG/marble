I can understand how the edges are rough
And they cut you like the tiny slithers of glass
And you feel too much
And you don't know how long you're gonna last,

But everyone you know, is tryin'a smooth it over,
Find a way to make the hurt go away,
But everyone you know, is tryin'a smooth it over,
Like you're trying to scream underwater,
But, I won't let you make the great escape,
I'm never gonna watch you checkin out of this place
I'm not gonna lose you
Cause the passion and pain
Are gonna keep you alive someday
Gonna keep you alive someday

I feel like I could wave my fist infront of your face
And you wouldn't flinch or even feel a thing
And you retreat to your silent corner
Like you decided the fight was over for ya,

Everyone you know, is tryin'a smooth it over,
Find a way to make the hurt go away,
Everyone you know, is tryin'a smooth it over,
Everyone needs a floor they can fall through
I won't let you make the great escape,
I'm never gonna watch you checkin outta this place
I'm not gonna lose you
Cause the passion and pain
Are gonna keep you alive someday
They're gonna keep you alive someday

Oh, Terrified of the dark, but not if you go with me
And I don't need a pill to make me know
And I wrote the book already,
But that chapter of my life will soon be done

I'm the king of the great escape
You're not gonna watch me checkin outta this place
You're not gonna lose me
Cause the passion and pain
Are gonna keep us alive, someday
Yeah the passion and the pain
Are gonna keep us alive someday, someday ---
