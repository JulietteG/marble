Ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream
Ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream

Rock and roll, y'all!

P-I-N-K, P-I-M-P
I'm back again
I know y'all missed me
I'm so, so sick
Can't handle it
Yeah, I talk shit
Just deal with it

My rims are twenty-three inch
And they're black on black
No, they're not his
Diamonds all over my teeth (her teeth)
You can try and try, you can't beat me

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight, I'll do what I want
'Cuz I can (ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream)

You know I'm rare
You stop and stare
You think I care
I don't
You talk real loud
But you ain't saying nothing cool
I could fit your whole house in my swimming pool

My life's a fantasy
That you're not smart enough to even dream
My ice is making me freeze
You can try and try, you can't beat me

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight, I'll do what I want
'Cuz I can (ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream)

Yeah, I'm super thick
People say I'm much too chic
Come and kiss the ring
You just might learn a couple things
I'm trying to school you, dog
Roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof, roof
I'm your worst nightmare
Bring it, we can take it there
What, are you scared?

So I'll cash my checks and place my bets
And hope I'll always win
Even if I don't I'm fucked because
I live a life of sin
But it's alright
I don't give a damn
I don't play your rules, I make my own
Tonight, I'll do what I want
'Cuz I can (ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream)

Tonight, I'll do what I want
'Cuz I can (ice cream, ice cream, we all want ice cream)---Lyrics submitted by Paige.
