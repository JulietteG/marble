Oh Yeah!
Monday Tuesday we were cool
Wednesday I found out 'bout you
caught my heart by tellin lies
you weren't what you advertised

(Chorus)
But silly me
to believe
I, I, I, I was unique
when I'm there you put on a show
oh oh oh you gotta go
cause what's true
about you
who are you when I'm gone?
wanted to
be with you
don't know what I was on
cause you got me
to forget me
oh oh oh you know thats true
ya you got me
to forget me
so Friday I'll be over U

Oh Yeah!

No no I ain't gonna cry
go and be with her tonight
I really don't care
what you do
cause Friday I'll be over U

[Chorus]

Oh Yeah!
Oh Yeah!

And silly me
to believe
when I'm there you put on a show
Oh Oh Oh you know thats true

(Oh Oh)

Yeah you got me
to forget me
(whoa)
Yeah you got me
to forget me
so Friday I'll be over U

Cause what's true
about you
who are you when I'm gone?
wanted to
be with you
don't know what I was on
Cause you got me
(Cause you got me)
to forget me
(to forget me)
Oh Oh Oh you know that's true
yeah you got me
to forget me
so Friday I'll be over U---Lyrics submitted by Hillary.
