Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maybe I'll need you
Maybe I won't
Well someday I'll want to
But right now I don't
Is it so hard to understand
I'm just a girl without a plan
You hold on too tight
Well take a few steps back tonight

I don't need you to save me
I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me
How to live before I learn
If I fall apart,
If it breaks my heart
Well I still got all the pieces
That you gave me, that you gave me

Maybe you'll tell me
Well, I told you so
But maybe my screw ups
Is how I will know
Why can you let me hit the ground?
Not like I'm lost and can't be found
I don't wanna fight
Well take a few steps back tonight

I don't need you to save me
I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me
How to live before I learn
If I fall apart,
If it breaks my heart
Well I still got all the pieces
That you gave me, don't need you to save me

I know it's easier to control
Is that hard to let go?
Don't tell me the error before I start

Maybe I'll need you
Maybe I won't
Well someday I'll want to
But right now I don't

I don't need you to save me
I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me
How to live before I learn
If I fall apart,
If it breaks my heart,
Well I still got all the pieces
That you gave me, that you gave me
The pieces that you gave me

I don't need you to save me
I'd rather crash and burn
Don't need you to tell me
How to live before I learn
If I fall apart,
If it breaks my heart
Well I still got all the pieces
That you gave me
The pieces that you, that you gave me---Lyrics submitted by Rachel Horowitz.
