Now that we've reached the end,
And I'm the only one surviving,
I'm just waiting for the morning light,
To touch my skin,
Warm my heart,
But I see a dead world at sunrise.
A dead world at sunrise,
And nothing can reverse the state.
Who now will pray
And save my soul
When hell ascends?
And calls my name?
I'm alone,
And so forth and so on.
Their faces left,
I'm longing for death,
I'm in torture.
Torture,
It's all that's left of my memories.
The cold hard truth,
Bitter and sweet,
Though I can't touch them, see them,
They are there, silent.
They listen,
Silent though, they listen.
But I see a dead world at sunrise.
A dead world at sunrise,
And nothing can reverse the state.
We are still one,
and I'm missing pieces of myself,
Of myself, of myself...---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
