You've come to save the world?
What do you believe?
What do you believe?

So you've been chosen:
By your eyes,
By your hands,
By the choices that you call your own,
And price that you would sell your own soul.
Pay the toll.
Carry your,
Carry your last test of flesh and bone
We make exchanges as the story unfolds.

You've come to save the world?
What do you believe?
What do you believe?---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
