You make your way but don't belong
I swear you're not the only one.
Is that what you've been dreaming?
Is that what you've been dreaming?

There's other ways of staying strong,
Than keeping out the other ones.
I feel the light years in between
What you say and what you mean.
You won't get through with that phony confidence,
I hear you speak
But nothing is said.
You'll be stranded on the other side,
Endless nights upon endless nights.
Endless nights upon endless nights.
You'll be alone,
Alone to the grave.

There's a place in all of us, same in everyone,
Making right the balances in all of us.
Aching and burning and growing and learning,
And building the world around us. 
Until our lives are done, we'll share the same emotions,
Shed tears of eulogy, then turn to plant the seeds
Still you can't hear me

Call out your name and try to get through,
I never hear back, never hear back

My words became a thousand arrows,
Slicing through the endless barricades,
So that everyone on earth could hear my call,
And I watched for you.

You're putting me on,
You've chosen to swear off the general population.

All those around you draw to a quiet
Your eyes dart across the room
But it's just an illusion
The room doesn't exist- it's only you and I.
And it's almost like we can't fail at all,
Or maybe we've failed already,
What you choose to see is real:
A cold dark world of enemies,
Obstacles you can never overcome,
Or a bright future ahead.

So tell the whole world and we'll start brand new.
Strip the shackles off, let me look at you.
If you can't reach out like you've been longing to,
I'll have to rethink all that I thought I knew.

Call out your name and try to get through,
I never hear back, never hear back
From you.
