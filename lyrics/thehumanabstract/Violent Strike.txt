And out of the great beyond came a pitch-black multitude,
Here to choose the weakest of our race:
Hellhounds with the devil's own face
Confused a violent strike for something finally here to guide the way,
Our faith in order was a mistake.
So fearful and divine and devoid of grace,
They try to run but there's no escape.
And the light decayed on that final day,
Fear crept up inside
Night became something more than a trade,
And our slumber, a weakness that we all can share.
Death calling in the wind: "This is the end."

I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky,
It was like a call from the other side.

What will you do now? 
The fires of hell are raining down.
Deep inside you're starting to shake 
And slowly losing ground.
Everyone is dead.  Your bravery is useless.
Your bravery is useless.

I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky,
It was like a call from the other side,
And there I cried, out of control and paralyzed,
As everything I once was died.

There's no way I'd be dying honorably,
If they came and took my life now.
There's no way I'd be dying honorably.

Regrets in tow, they didn't even stand a chance,
So hear me, final lines have been drawn:
To build again, to fall again.
It's warn me down to the last straw.
It took me down, took me until I don't feel human at all.
Test me now, test me.
I don't feel human at all.

So don't you go thinking that you found strength without a trial or two.
These days have got me feeling like a god.
Hear me, final lines have been drawn:
To build again, to fall again.
It's warn me down to the last straw.

And I held on so long to my home,
Until a tempest came
She came in and swept it away. 
[repeat]

Where's your bravery?
What will bravery do for you now?---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
