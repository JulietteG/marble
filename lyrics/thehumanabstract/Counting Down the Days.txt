Who are you?  What have you become?
A charming illusion, a source of confusion.
Another day you'll win the race.
A charming illusion, a source of confusion.

Who are you?  What have you become?
A charming illusion, a source of confusion.
Another day you'll find your place.
A charming illusion, a source of confusion.

Another rise to power,
No matter who or when,
And we will know of our freedom
Never again, never again.
A common thread of distance,
In the hearts of men,
And we'll have love for our brothers,
Never again, never again.
We are all the victims of a will to overcome.

How far we've gone out of  touch.
There's no right side of war.
There's no right side of war.
Can't justify it,
There's no right side of war.
There's no right side of war.

To erase away
All that we've become.
They can't see we're all one.

A voice cries from underneath:
Dark shepherds strongly though you wield the staff.
You're weakened by comfort
There's no way you're prepared for what happens last:
Action
Reaction
Like an eye for an eye from our tribal days.
The lesser ones demand reaction.
Dare to challenge the one universal law,
Set you up to fall?
Do you understand now
Why your days are numbered?
Do you understand?

The course of events were a riddle,
A pause in time,
A search for the solution as we stood in line,
Honored our oppressors and paid our fines,
Then all became clear as the ferocity inside began,
To hear the drums of war resound across the land,
Announcing the fate to shed blood upon the earth,
It is ours.

Doomed to repeat our history,
There is more than one way to manifest the possibility of how things could be.
No time to question how, when, or why,
We simply come together or die.

To a system of capitalist politicians,
False face of a greater power:
Your empire will fall
Bringing about the end of an era.
Warmongers,
Your bloodlust to conquer
Turns the moments of our lives
Into a ticking timebomb of your own creation,
Counting down the days,
Rot in your graves.

How far we've gone out of touch.
There's no right side of war.
There's no right side of war.
Can't justify it,
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war.

To erase away
All that we've become.
To erase away 
All that we love.
There's no right side of war.---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
