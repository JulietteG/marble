My momma said son you cant hold a job
You better buy a gun and go out and rob
Get yourself a guitar and learn how to play
Yah that rockn roll like stealin all day
She said oooooooooooh yeah yeah
She said oooooooooooh yeah yeah

The work it aint hard and the hours aint long
I make more money than god just for singin this song
Give a little lick and make a girl go crazy (ahhh)
Yah rockn roll like takin candy from babies
say oooooooooooh yeah yeah
oooooooooooh 

Rockn roll aint ever been no crime in the states
And that's the very thang yall that made Britain great
Money for nothing yeah youve got that straight
Yah that rockn roll is stealin all day
She said oooooooooooh yeah yeah
She said oooooooooooh yeah yeah

My momma said son you cant hold a job
You better buy a gun and go out and rob
Get yourself a guitar and learn how to play
Yah that rockn roll like stealin all day
She said oooooooooooh yeah yeah
oooooooooooh yeah yeah

Rockn roll like stealin all day
She said oooooooooooh yeah yeah
Oooooooooooh---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
