How ya feelin'?
The day has had its way with both of us
And no, I've gone out of my way
But I'm not free
From this pain i'm feelin'
I was a fool to think some day you would, come around
And no no no I'm not thinkin' that way
'Cause now I see, 
You are not what you seem
 You are a mystery to me
 Sometimes I just wanna scream

I think you should just go away 'cause
Theres no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way forget it baby youre not comin' in

How's your day been?
'cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns
But no no no i feel better today
'cause i'm off my knees

You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
 Sometimes I just wanna scream
I think you should just go away 'cause
Theres no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way 
Forget it baby youre not coming' in
A heart ready for a life of sorrow,
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows lock my doors
'cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore
Yeah
-Musical interlude-
I think you should just go away 'cause
There no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
 Forget it baby youre not comin' in
A heart ready for a life of sorrow,
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows lock my doors
'cause my heart won't be your rag doll anymore---Lyrics submitted by lex.
