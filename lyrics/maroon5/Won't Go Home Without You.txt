I asked her to stay but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say
The words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late she's gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?
Hard to believe it

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
And the noises that she made kept me awake
The weight of the things that remain unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?
Hard to believe it

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

ooohh....

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

ooohh....

Of all the things I've felt I've never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I never let you go
I should not ever let you go

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

ooohh....

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you---
