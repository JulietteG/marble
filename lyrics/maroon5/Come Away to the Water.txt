Come away little lass
Come away to the water
To the one that are waiting only for you
Come away little lass
Come away to the water
Away from the light you always knew
We are calling to you.

Come away little lad
Come away to the darkness
In the shade of the night well come looking for you
Come away little lad
Come away to the darkness
To the ones appointed to see it though
We are calling for you
We are coming for you

Come away little lamb
Come away to the water
Give yourself so we may live anew
Come away little lamb
Come away to the slaughter
To the ones appointed to see this through
We are calling for you
We are coming for you

Come away little lamb
come away to the water
To the arms that are waiting only for you
Come away little lamb
Come away to the slaughter
To the ones who appointed to see this through
We are calling for you
We are coming for you---
