I'm full of regrets for all the things
That I've done and said
And I don't know if it'll ever be okay to show
My face around here

Sometimes I wonder if I disappear
Would you ever turn your head and look
See if I'm gone 'cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you

That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful

Your just an innocent
Helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Going after anything that I can get

So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back 'cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you

That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful

And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
Ohh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You better turn your head and look
See if I'm gone 'cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you

That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful

And I've done you so wrong
And treated you bad, strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up---
