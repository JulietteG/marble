I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
Im searching for a song tonight
Im changing all of the stations

I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away

I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me

So Im following the map that leads to you,
The map that leads to you
Aint nothing I can do 
The map that leads to you 
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Aint nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause on this trench has come over me
Now I cant get over you
No I just cant, get over you

I was there for you in your darkest times 
I was there for you in your darkest night 
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me

So Im following the map that leads to you,
The map that leads to you
Aint nothing I can do 
The map that leads to you 
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Aint nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Oh oh mm
Oh I was there for you oh in your darkest time
Oh I was there for you oh in your darkest night
Oh I was there for you oh in your darkest time
Oh I was there for you oh in your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back so wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me

So Im following the map that leads to you,
The map that leads to you
Aint nothing I can do 
The map that leads to you 
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Aint nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Beltran.
