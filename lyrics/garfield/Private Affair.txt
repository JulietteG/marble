Penny for your thoughts 
Mister, penny for your thoughts 
You look so far away 
It must be nice to drift that way 

Maybe it's a lady youre missing 
My, I hope not 
You see I've been watching you 
Well you don't seem impressed 

Jenny is my name 
And pleasure is my game 
And I keep a tidy home 

And I was good once as I ever once was 
'bout as good as one night should be 
But not really quite as good as in years gone by 

Yes I'm as good once as I ever once was 
'bout as good as one night should be 
But not really quite as good as in years gone by 

Time fly now 
Well time fly 

Actually I was thinking 
You see it helps me to relax a bit 
I'd just eaten dinner in Paris 
And I walked along the Champs-lyses

Well Jacob is my name 
And the butcher is my trade 
Yet I haven't seen work 
For quite some time 

And I'm not as good as I once was 
Or as good as one night should be 
Yet I haven't really thought about it in a long, long time 

No I'm not as good as I once was 
Or as good as one night should be 
Yet I haven't really thought about it in a long, long time 

It's been a long time 
Been a long time now 
Been a long time 

But I could use some conversation 
If you care to stay a while 
That'd be fine Jacob, she said 
But not here 

So they walked for a while 
And they spoke that little truth 
You see there's no need to lie 
When talking to a stranger 

Yeah Jacob had been a butcher 
For some twenty-two and a half years 
Until in times when there was difficulty 
And so little business 

And Jenny she was a housewife 
For only three years 
When her man had been killed 
In a political battle 

Now when Jacob heard this 
He looked at Jenny 
And he called out 
Yes he called out 

Jenny this world 
It's a private affair 
For those out there 
For those with the power 

Oh Jenny this world 
It's a private affair 
For those out there 
For those with the power 

That may be so Jacob 
But if it wasn't for ones like you and I 
They'd not be there now 

Ain't no sense to bitch about it cause you all know what's gone wrong 
Late at night, when youre in your bed, the bad don't seem so wrong 

There ain't no sense to bitch about it cause you all know what's gone wrong 
Late at night, when youre in your bed, the bad don't seem so wrong 

There ain't no sense to bitch about it cause you all know what's gone wrong 
When it's late at night, and youre in your bed, the bad don't seem so wrong 

There ain't no sense to bitch about it cause you all know what's gone wrong 
When it's late at night, and youre in your bed, the bad don't seem so wrong 

So damn wrong 
So damn wrong 

You know it seems I've been fighting since the day I was born but I know that I can move on 
And it looks like I'll be fighting till the day that I die but I don't let it bring me down 

It seems I've been fighting since the day I was born but I know that I can move on 
And it looks like I'll be fighting till the day that I die but I don't let it bring me down 

There ain't no sense to bitch about it cause you all know what's gone wrong 
When it's late at night, and youre in your bed, the bad don't seem so wrong 

There ain't no sense to bitch about it cause you all know what's gone wrong 
When it's late at night, and youre in your bed, the bad don't seem so wrong 

There ain't no sense to bitch about it cause you all know what's gone wrong 
When it's late at night, and youre in your bed, the bad don't seem so wrong---Lyrics submitted by Michael Lozinski.
