I miss you where are you hiding 
miss you your soul's not lighting up now
I miss you and the hope once shining through you did someone hurt you
you give in to bribery
did fear wrap around you
did power strong arm
I would forgive you

If you would be the change again
then I could support you
If freedom rang aloud again
you're missing
I'm afraid to fly where nothing's sacred
afraid to trust this house of bankers
made a lie of justice
is she blind.---Lyrics submitted by gloryholequeen.
