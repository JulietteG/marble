Your wisdom's in the ocean
Deep under the surface
Where it's hard to breathe
You are guiding me

And you're like a seed
Growing in everything
And you're like a seed
A flower opening

You're gentle
Like aspring rain yet you're sharp 
As a sunrise
Your generosity is the air 
All around me

And you're like a seed
Growing in everything
And you're like a seed
A flower opening
You are a part of me---Lyrics submitted by Artyom Surdul.
