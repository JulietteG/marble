We were cut and smelled of petals
These scented promises had me
Thinking that I was special
For the new lease of life I had got
Oh no, woah oh
For a minute thought my heart had stopped
Oh no, woah oh
And the lessons that I had were lost

Know you gotta think about it
Let me hear the things Im out to hear

Return to the scene of your glories
But not for the fame
To be stuck in the back sorting laundry
Of the same folks you cant stand
Oh no, woah oh
What a waste for an ivory hand
Oh no, woah oh
Exquisitely shocked as I am

Know you gotta think about it
Let me hear the things Im out to hear
See me like you do in memories
Of a time you barely knew me girl

Always walking through webs
See nostalgia as a threat
Do you still want it now we got it?---
