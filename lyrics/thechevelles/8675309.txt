Jenny Jenny who can I turn too
you give me somethin' I can hold on too
I know you think I'm like the others before
who saw your name and number on the wall

Jenny I got your number
I need to make you Mine
Jenny don't change your number

Jenny Jenny your the girl for me
you don't know me but you make me so happy
I tried to call you before but i lost my nerve
I tried my imagination but I was disturbed

Jenny I got your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny don't change your number

I got it  I got I got it 
I got your number on the wall
I got it  I got I got it
for a good time, for a good time call

for the price of a dime I can always turn to you
