A cowboy came to Waikiki
Took a look around
Saw the girls in the short grass skirts
And he was hula bound

So he traded his chaps and his ten gallon hat
for a surfboard and a pair of thongs
Sold his gun, bought a small ukulele
And he learned to sing this song:

Yippie-aye-oh don-ho mahi mahi
Its a tie dye tiki and some barbecued Poi
I'm riding the range and the waves of Hawaii
I'm a Waikiki cowboy
I'm a Waikiki cowboy

Fell in love on the very first day
With a girl with dark brown eyes
He never could pronounce her nam
So he called her sweetie pie
And for her he would try a coconut-and-papaya
And for him she would do-si-do
And when the sun was gone
He would sing this song
By the light of the volcano

Yippie-aye-oh don-ho mahi mahi
Its a tie dye tiki and some barbecued Poi
I'm riding the range and the waves of Hawaii
I'm a Waikiki cowboy
I'm a Waikiki cowboy

Sometimes he dreams of going back to Texas
And giving up his little grass hut
But then a Palm tree sways
He comes to his senses
And he says
(Spoken)
"What am I, nuts?"

Yippie-aye-oh don-ho mahi mahi
Its a tie dye tiki and some barbecued Poi
I'm riding the range and the waves of Hawaii
I'm a Waikiki cowboy
Yippie-aye-oh don-ho mahi mahi
Its a tie dye tiki and some barbecued Poi
I'm riding the range and the waves of Hawaii
I'm a Waikiki cowboy
I'm a Waikiki cowboy
I'm a Waikiki cowboy

(Spoken)
It's kinda fun.
Hahaha, you gotta leave that stuff on there.---Lyrics submitted by Kevin.
