She is a hatred girl, wow
I like to pretend everything is ok, but,
She leads "jump in a river"
I don't like rivers much
Guess i just don't like makin' waves

Some things go wrong,
Some things go beyond, and 
Some things go way too fast

Well, I've remember the crunch,
Like a Joe Louis punch
Guess he'd better stop doing our own thing now
I've remember thinkin' it out,
Should take a dreaming of, maybe
I just got thrown up my lunch

Some things go wrong,
Some things go beyond, and
Some things go way too fast

I got a Mexican candle to protect me from bad luck
Got a pocket watch to tell me when my time is up
It doesn't matter to me, cause you are a hatred girl
And I'll probably stop, pretend that everything cool

Some things go wrong,
Some things go beyond,and 
Some things go way too fast---Lyrics submitted by Gleb Borcov.
