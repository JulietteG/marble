Yeah, you might have somebody
No, but you don't got me 
Oh, but you're thinking about it
Yeah, so easy to see
I won't tell nobody
Nobody's gonna tell on me
We both know it baby
Exactly what this could be

But sometimes 
You can't hide the way you feel inside

Your love,
Is the only thing, I can't live without it
It's too good not to talk about it, 
About your love
And I wanna know
How exactly did I get around it? 
How did I ever live without it? 
Without your love
And a little bit of loving beats a whole lotta nothing at all

You got this thing about ya
And that thing is just what I need
You deserve a little something better, 
And I'll be waiting patiently
I've been thinking about a life together
Even if it's the death of me
And I know we'll never live forever, 
But I don't wanna wait and see

But sometimes 
You can't hide the way you feel inside

Your love,
Is the only thing, I can't live without it
It's too good not to talk about it, 
About your love
And I wanna know
How exactly did I get around it? 
How did I ever live without it? 
Without your love
And a little bit of loving beats a whole lotta nothing at all

I could be the only thing that you'd ever need
And I could be something that you don't wanna leave
Let me be the one that's gonna make you believe, 
that you were really made for me

Your love,
Is the only thing, I can't live without it
It's too good not to talk about it, 
About your love
And I wanna know
How exactly did I get around it? 
How did I ever live without it? 
Without your love 
Your love,
Is the only thing, I can't live without it
It's too good not to talk about it, 
About your love
And I wanna know
How exactly did I get around it? 
How did I ever live without it? 
Without your love
And a little bit of loving beats a whole lotta nothing at all---Lyrics submitted by Caroline.
