Let's go out, get lit, get loose tonight
Sing a song, get wrong, make it feel alright
Drinks on ice
Stars in our eyes
Ain't got a lot of money
But you're a dime

Hey hey
All I need is a whole whole
Lot of you everyday day's
A holiday ain't nothing we can't do
Now all I need baby
Is a little time
And a whole lot of you

Get me buzzed on your love
Lemme steal a kiss
Bubblegum on your tongue
No I can't resist
Gotta leave all your worries at the door
Cuz life ain't nothin but a big dance floor

Nobody wanna be alone, alone tonight
So come on baby take me home, home tonight
So come on and take me home ---
