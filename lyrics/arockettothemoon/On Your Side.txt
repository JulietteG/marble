I know your face
Your eyes, your lips, your taste
I love the way
You know just what to say
It was a Saturday, remember it like yesterday
She new my name, imagine that
I know this road, the way that no one goes
So cold, so cold, baby, youre so cold, so cold

Take it easy baby we can make it right
Girl, you know my love is always on your side
Rest your eyes tonight
You know that my love
You know that my love is on your side

I love your pretty face and
How it rests on your pillow case
We get in fights
You spend the night
And I dont see how we get this way
But I think were alright
So cold, so cold, baby, youre so cold, so cold

Take it easy baby we can make it right
Girl, you know my love is always on your side
Rest your eyes tonight
You know that my love
You know that my love is on your side


Take it easy baby we can make it right
Girl, you know my love is always on your side
Rest your eyes tonight, rest your eyes tonight, rest your eyes tonight
You know that my love
You know that my love
You know that my love (is on your side)
You know that my love is on your side---Lyrics submitted by Tara.
