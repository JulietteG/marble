No Im never gonna leave you darling
No Im never gonna go regardless
Everything inside of me, is living in your heartbeat
Even when all the lights are fading
Even then, if your hope was shaking
Im here holding on

Chorus:
I will always be yours forever and and more
Through the push and the pull
I still drown in your love
And drink til Im drunk
And all that Ive done, is it ever enough?

Im hanging on a line here baby
I need more than ifs and maybes
Well come down from the highest heights
Still searching for the reason why
And now I know what its like,
Reaching from the other side
After all that Ive done

Chorus:
I will always be yours forever and and more
Through the push and the pull
I still drown in your love
And drink til Im drunk
And all that Ive done, is it ever enough?

For all that its worth, is it worth it?
Cause more than its hard to desert it
For all that its worth, is it worth it?
How do we know without searching?

I will write you this song to get back whats ours
Would that be enough?

Chorus:
I will always be yours forever and and more
Through the push and the ull
I still drown in your love
And drink til Im drunk
And all that Ive done, is it ever enough?

For all that its worth, is it worth it?
Is it ever enough?
How could we know without searching?
Is it ever enough?---
