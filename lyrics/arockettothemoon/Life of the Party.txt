They're on you like a tattoo
They're watching every move that you make
Your blue eyes were white lies
I thought you were mine for the taking

You punched my lights out
Now you're free to be the lonely life of the party
Girl you'll see
Lets get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

Never should have told you that I fell in love
cos you turned me right around and threw me down
and now i can't get up
You'll be sorry just you wait and see
But lets get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

You puzzle like a jigsaw
You love me now we don't fit together
I used up my last shot/straw
I thought i would drink you forever

But now you're my last call
Now you're free to be the lonely life of the party
Girl you'll see
Lets get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

Never should have told you that I fell in love
cos you turned me right around and threw me down
and now i can't get up
You'll be sorry just you wait and see
But lets get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

I know why you set the trap
I know why you dress in black
Flaws in your act tonight?
I know how you beat the wrap?
Someday you'll be crawling back
Crawling, you'll be crawling back to me

Never should have told you that I fell in love
cos you turned me right around and threw me down
and now i can't get up
You'll be sorry just you wait and see
But lets get one thing straight

Never should have told you that I fell in love
cos you turned me right around and threw me down
and now i can't get up
You'll be sorry just you wait and see
But lets get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

Never should have told you that I fell in love
cos you turned me right around and threw me down
and now i can't get up
You'll be sorry just you wait and see
But lets get one thing straight

You're gonna regret you left me---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
