My eyes are no good blind without her
The way she moves I never doubt her
When she talks she somehow creeps into my dreams
She's a doll, a catch, a winner
I'm in love and no beginner
Could ever grasp or understand
Just what she means

Baby, baby blue eyes
Stay with me by my side
Til the morning
Through the night
Baby, stand here holding my sides
Close your baby blue eyes
Every moment feels right
And I may feel like a fool
But I'm the only one dancing with you

I drive her home when she can't stand
I'd like to think I'm a better man
For not letting her do what she's been known to do
She wears heels and she always falls
I let her think she's a know it all
But whatever she does wrong it seems so right
My eyes don't believe her
But my heart swears by her

Baby, baby blue eyes
Stay with me by my side
Til the morning
Through the night
Baby, stand here holding my sides
Close your baby blue eyes
Every moment feels right
And I may feel like a fool
But I'm the only one dancing with you

(I can't get you out of my mind)
I swear I've been there
I swear I've done that
I'll do whatever it takes
Just to see those

Baby, baby blue eyes
Stay with me by my side
Til the morning
Through the night
Baby, stand here holding my sides
Close your baby blue eyes
Every moment feels right
And I may feel like a fool
But I'm the only one dancing with those

Baby, baby blue eyes
Stay with me by my side
Til the morning
Through the night
Baby, stand here holding my sides
Closing your eyes
Every moment feels right

My eyes are no good blind without her
The way she moves I never doubt her
When she talks she somehow creeps into my dream---Lyrics submitted by Lydia.
