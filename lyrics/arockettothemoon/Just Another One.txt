She started dancing at the second that she heard the music play
[She's always moving]
She looks at me but then I look back at her
She turns away
[She knows exactly what she's doing]

She moves closer and I'm thinking to myself that she's all mine
[She's all mine]
We start talking and she takes my hand like she does this all the time

Go! Go! Go! 
You never had the time because you move too slow
And I know, know, know
That she could care less about love
It's just for fun
I'm just another one

I'm just a notch in her bough 
It's laying on the floor
I know her so well
Call me crazy but I'm thinking to myself that I can't do this anymore

And she knows how to bring me down [2x]

And shes low, low, low!
She always keeps me waiting cause shes so shallow
And oh, oh, oh!
The only thing she ever said
Besides I think we're done
I'm just another one

Cause she can't
Ever fall in love
Cause this is who she is
And this is all she knows

Go Go Go 
You never had the time because you move too slow
I know, know, know
That she could care less about love
It's just for fun
I'm just another one

I'm just another one

And I could care less about her
She's just another one---
