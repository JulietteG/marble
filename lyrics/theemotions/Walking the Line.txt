You're walking the line
You turned my life around
Say you will and then you won't 
Say you do and then you don't
Take my love 
Take my love

Cherish your love (you know I do)
In you it can be found
Say you will and then you won't 
Say you do and then you don't
Take my love Take my love

Oh Ooh Oh Oh
Walking the line with my love
Oh...Say you will; then you won't 
Say you do; then you don't
Take my love 
Take my love

Just to pass the time
Fill these arms of mine
Say you will this time
To prepare for you 
Love and kisses seems to do
Say you will this time
This time...

The sunshine is you
The brightest light around
Say you will and then you won't 
Say you do and then you don't
Take my love Take my love

Oh Ooh Oh Oh
Walking the line with my love
Oh, Say you will; then you won't 
Say you do; then you don't
Take my love Take my love

Walking the line
Say you will; then you won't 
Say you do; then you don't
Love, love...

Walking, walking, walking
Walking the line
Walking, walking, walking

Oh, Say you will then you won't 
Say you do and then you don't

I will take you, baby, if I really want your love...

Walking, walking, walking
Walking the line
Walking, walking, walking---Lyrics submitted by Michael Miller.
