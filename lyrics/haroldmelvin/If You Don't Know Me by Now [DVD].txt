If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me (ooh)

All the things that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now baby  I know the difference,  between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to upset  our happy home.

Oh don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
Cause we only act like children when we argue, fuss and fight eh, eh. 

If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me by now)
You will never, never, never know me (youll never, never, never know me eh, eh)
If you don't know me by now (If you don'tIf you don't know me baby)
You will never, never, never know me, (no you wont, eh, eh)

We all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together that should be so easy to do

Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye
what good is a love affair when you can't see eye to eye? Oh

If you don't know me by now (If you don'tIf you don't know me baby) 
You will never, never, never know me (eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) 
If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me by now) 
You will never, never, never know me (no you wontno) 
If you don't know me by now (ten long years, ten long years weve been together)
If you don't know me by now; (no, no, no)---Lyrics submitted by anselmo.
