There is nothing else to say except I love you
And I hope youll always stay in love with me
Ive got so much love it will cover you all over
You dont need no coat cuz baby youve got me
And oh how I love you
(Oh how I love you)

Theres not a day goes by that I dont think about you
Youre every breath I take
Youre every song I sing
Words cant express the happiness you give me
Cause baby in you Ive got everything

Oh how I love you
(Betcha didnt know how much I really love you)

(Betcha didnt know how much I really care)

Dont you ever think that I dont love you cuz I do
Dont you ever think that I dont care
It would break my heart if you thought I didnt care

Girl Im crazy bout you (girl Im crazy about you)

There are so many ways I wanna say I love you
If I could find the words Id surely write them down
No Words cant express the happiness you give me
Cuz baby I like having you around

Oh how I love you
(Betcha didnt know how much I really love you)

(Betcha didnt know how much I really care)

Girl I love you, girl I love you

Theres not a day goes by, theres not a day goes by
That I dont think about you
Sometimes I sit and I wonder why, I guess I really love you
(Betcha you didnt know)
I may not tell you all the time that dont mean I dont love you, I dont love you
(Betcha you didnt know)
I just have things on my mind sometimes baby I really love you

Take some time, sure youll find
(I really love you)
Take some time, sure youll find
(I really love you)
You just take my breath, huh, away I swear I really love you ---
