breathe it in, and breathe it out
and pass it on its almost out
the sooner you stick it in your veins, 
the deeper the thought, there's no more pain

its not a habit, it's cool
i feel alive
if you don't have it your'e on 
the other side

im sober now, i'm cold, alone
i'm just a person on my own
i'm in heaven i'm a god
i'm everywhere, i feel so hot

it's not a habit, it's cool,
i feel alive
if you don't have it your'e on the other side
i'm not an addict, maybe that's a lie

free me, free me
look at me i'm fallin faster

it is not a habit it is cool i feel alive i feel it...---Lyrics submitted by kristen.
