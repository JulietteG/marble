Breathe it in, and breathe it out,
And pass it on, it's almost out,

We're so creative, so much more,
We're high above, but on the floor,

It's not a habit it's cool, I feel alive,
If you don't have it you're on the other side,

The deeper you stick it in your veins,
The deeper the thoughts,
There's no more pain,

I'm in heaven,
I'm a god,
And everywhere I feel so hot,

It's not a habit it's cool, I feel alive,
If you don't have it you're on the other side,
I'm not an addict,
Maybe that's a lie. . .

It's over now, I'm cold, alone,
I'm just a person on my own,
Nothing means a thing to me,
Oh, nothing means a thing to me,

It's not a habit it's cool, I feel alive,
If you don't have it you're on the other side,
I'm not an addict,
Maybe that's a lie. . .

Free me,
Leave me,
Watch me as I'm going down,
Free me, 
See me,
Look at me I'm falling and I'm falling,

It is not a habit it is cool I feel alive I feel,
It is not a habit it is cool I feel alive,

It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side
I'm not an addict,
Maybe that's a lie. . .

I'm not an addict,
I'm not an addict,
I'm not an addict.---Lyrics submitted by Alicia.
