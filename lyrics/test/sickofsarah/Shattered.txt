I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
I think I had it but I lost it somehow
I finally figured out just what I'm all about
I think I had it but I lost it somehow

If it was up to me, I'll always make it shatter
I know you very well, I know you very well

I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
I think I had it but I lost it somehow
I finally figured out just what I'm all about
I think I had it but I lost it somehow

I think I'm ready now
I think I've fallen for you
You've seen a difference 
And it happened right before you
And when it withers down to nothing left but sound
Oh, can you hear me now?

If it was up to me, I'd always make it shatter
I'll never say goodbye,
My lovesick Valentine
I know you very well, I know you very well
I know it very well, I know it very well

Shatter, Shatter
(Oh, oh, Oh)
Make you say when, make you say when

If it was up to me, I'll always make it shatter
I'll never say goodbye
My lovesick Valentine
I know you very well, I know you very well
I know it very well, I know it very well

I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
I think I had it but I lost it somehow
I finally figured out just what I'm all about
I think I had it but I lost it somehow---Lyrics submitted by kristin.
