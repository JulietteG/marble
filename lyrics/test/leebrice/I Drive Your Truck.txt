Eighty-Nine Cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hangin from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots and a Go Army Shirt folded in the back
This thing burns gas like crazy, but thats alright
People got their ways of coping
Oh, and Ive got mine

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the pains a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

I leave that radio playing
That same ole country station where ya left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And youd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin down on my face
Hey, man Im tryin to be tough
And momma asked me this morning
If Id been by your grave
But that flag and stone aint where I feel you anyway

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the pains a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes I drive your truck

Ive cussed, Ive prayed, Ive said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when Im missing you this much

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
Til all the pains a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes, brother sometimes

I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you dont mind, I hope you dont mind
I drive your truck ---
