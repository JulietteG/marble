she got her daddy's tongue and temper
sometimes her mouth could use a filter
God shook his head the day he built her
oh, but i bet he smiles.

she loves and lives her life unruly
tears up that dirty road in a dooley
dangerious absolutely
and in a lil while
she'll be rounding that corner on three wheels
aint slowing down
yelling come on, jump in, always up to something
crazy got nothing on her
she aint right, she aint right, she aint right
but she just right for me

she said she wants to meet my momma 
i said i dont think you otta
be like mixin oil and water
but by midnight she had 
momma on the coffee table dancin' 
comin' unwound good god, i swear, cant take her anywhere,
whats the girl gonna do next
she aint right, she aint right, she aint right, 
but she's just right for me

every once in awhile she'll give me that smile
and say i just dont see somebody like you
loving somebody like me
she aint right, nahhh she aint right, she aint right
she aint right, she aint right, she's just right,
she's just right, she's just righttt for me

hmmm she's just right
she's just right
she aint right
she's just righttt 
for meeeee---Lyrics submitted by amy.
