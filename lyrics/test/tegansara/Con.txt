I listened in yes i'm guilty of this you should know this
I broke down and wrote you back before you had a chance to
Forget forgotten i am moving past this giving notice
I have to go yes i know the feeling know you're leaving

Calm down i'm calling you to say
I'm capsized staring on the edge of safe
Calm down i'm calling back to say
I'm home now i'm coming around

Coming around but nobody likes to
But i really like to cry
Nobody likes me maybe if i cry

Spelled out your name and list the reasons pain of heart
Don't call me back i imagine you and i was distant non-existent
I'll follow suit and laid out on my back imagine that
A million hours left to think of you and think of that

Calm down i'm calling you to say
I'm capsized staring on the edge of safe
Calm down i'm calling back to say
I'm home now i'm coming around

Coming around but nobody likes to
But i really like to cry
Well nobody likes me maybe if i cry

Encircle me i need to be taken down
Encircle me i need to be taken down
Encircle me i need to be taken down
Encircle me i need to be taken down

Well nobody likes to
But i really like to cry
Well nobody likes me maybe if i cry

Nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody
Nobody nobody nobody nobody

Encircle me i need to be taken down
Encircle me i need to be taken down
Encircle me i need to be taken down---Lyrics submitted by jenny.
