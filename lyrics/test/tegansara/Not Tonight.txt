Love pull your sorries in
I will pull your tangles out
In the back of your car I feel like
I have traveled nowhere

What will bring me home
What will make me stay, stay
What will bring me home
What will make me stay, stay

well i don't know
i don't know
yeah i don't know
i don't know

Everything in my body says not tonight
Everything in my body said no
Everything in my body says not tonight
Everything in my body said no

What will bring me home
What will make me stay, stay
What will bring me home
What will make me stay, stay

Well I dont know
I dont know
Well i dont know
i dont know---Lyrics submitted by emma.
