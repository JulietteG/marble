Train whistle blowing makes a sleepy noise
Underneith their blankets go all the girls and boys
Heading from the station, out along the bay
All bound for morningtown, many miles away.

Sarah's at the engine, Tony rings the bell
John swings the lantern, to show that all is well
Rocking, rolling, riding, out along the bay
All bound for Morningtown, many miles away.

Maybe it is raining where our train will ride
But all the little travellers are snug and warm inside
Somewhere there is sunshine
Somewher there is day
Somewhere there is Morningtown, many miles away.---Lyrics submitted by Kathleen.
