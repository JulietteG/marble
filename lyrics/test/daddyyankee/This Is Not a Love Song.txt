Feel so close to you right now
This is not a love song
This is not a love song, song
Cuz I keep try to function
This is not a love song
This is not a love song

Gotta juggin on me, I dont wanna back down
Your body do me like Im bumping like that
Big boss need a hash tag
Surely I can show you, know how to get the top down
Now bring it back, take it low
Now bring it back, now take it low
Can I get it, can I get it

Im a tough boss, ht em with a though source
Top, she can hide, took her to the top floor
Bubble up ? like Im James Bond
King I am feeling in my kingdom
Surely on me, talking like she own me
Make a right move, her body linking over
Imma down but shes ready for the ?
This is not a love song baby

Feel so close to you right now
This is not a love song
I cant get a love song
This is not a love song
Cuz I keep try to function
This is not a love song
Ooh this is not a love song

All the models in the club well on my glow
How they dancing like is young with his polo
We, shout it out like they show low
In the shave I will bring all along girl
Bring it back, now take it that
I never got, well Im not
Gotta seek it, can I get it?

When it come to the game I play it like none
Please tell your shit, Im Mister Siaghan
Shut it and hit it like some cuz we living like we wanna dive young
Shout out to my DJ, put that shit on replay
Now I gotta, now I gotta dancing in the beat
Come and get your present, get to know me better
First name John, last me forever

Feel so close to you right now
This is not a love song
This is not a love song, song
Cuz I keep try to function
This is not a love song
But this is not a love song---
