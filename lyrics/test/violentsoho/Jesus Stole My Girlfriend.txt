Every day 
every afternoon 
tried so hard 
but lost to God. 

This time next year
 Ill be married 
this time next year
Ill say sorry 
but Jesus stole my girlfriend. 

I thought youre my friend. 
Ill guess again 
I look to the clouds 
God gives me a frown. 

This time next year 
Ill be married 
this time next year 
Ill say sorry 
but Jesus stole my girlfriend. 

Try to talk to me again. 
Ill never even sing or do anything. 

This time next year 
Ill be married 
this time next year 
Ill say sorry 
Jesus stole my girlfriend.
Jesus stole my girlfriend.
Jesus stole my girlfriend.---Lyrics submitted by Izaak.
