We can never know about the days to come
But we think about them anyway
And I wonder if I'm really with you now
Or just chasing after some finer days

Anticipation
Anticipation is making me late
Is keeping me wai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ting

Can I tell you how easy it feels to be with you
How right your arms feel around me
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be

Anticipation
Anticipation is making me late
Is keeping me wai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ting

And tomorrow, we might not be together
I'm no prophet and I don't know nature's way
So I'll try and see into your eyes right now
And stay right here cuz these are the good ole days

These are the good ole days

Stay right here cuz these are the good ole days

These are the good ole days!
These are the good ole days!
These are the good ole days!
These are...the good ole days!---Lyrics submitted by Bernard.
