(AMBA!)
Gimme dat fire (fire)
Gimme dat flame (flame, flame)
Gimme dat (gimme dat)
Gimme dat (gimme dat)
Gimme dat (gimme dat)
Absolutely you can gimme dat
If its mine (gimme dat)
Its good for me (gimme dat)
I want it all

Gimme dat bible
Gimme dat mic
Ill drop Jesus anyway so he can make a disciple
Cant surpass Christ theres no takin his title
A passion for Christ Ill have you prayin for revival
Gimma my city, yeah
Gimme dat less fish
Gospel of peace, yeah
You can give me dat fresh kicks
Gimme dat
Vest with your blessin Lord Im desperate
You gave me your life
So I look forward to my exit
I used to be a punk-kid
Used to wanna run, with
Dudes dat wanna hunt that
Turned our ones into hundreds
Used to run the blunt to be blunt
I wanted trees just to alter my mind
Now I find im wantin Jesus

Used to run and roll mad deep with the street clique
Corner holdin heat on the low like a secret
Gods spirit penetrated my soul on a sneak tip
Took control now Im in his floor like a leaflet

Gimme dat fire
Gimme dat flame
Gimme dat fresh wind
Gimme dat rain
Gimme dat freedom
You can have the chains
Gimme dat God who can gimme all things

Gimme dat fire, flame
Gimme dat fresh wind
Gimme dat rain
Gimme dat freedom
You can have the chains
Gimme dat God who can gimme all things

I know you got riches
I know you got ice
Your life is a big party
Youre partyin all night
You dont mind not knowin Christ
In your mind dats alright
You might not get this now
But youre kind of a Saul type

You keep with the trends
Cools your middle name
On your pants you got a chain
The juice like Lil Wayne
Youre tattooed in a Benz
Maybe youre inarranged
Ladies, you drivin crazy
Nothins crazier than your frame!
(This is a shame!)

Its the age and Im game
To be an agent of change
And at age, its like a page in a flame
Just smoke, just mirrors, just vapor is plain
You see, a Holy God is not one of your favorite things
I was just like you,
But God moved on a fellow
Gave me good news
Dat I could use on the ghetto
Maybe its you who wants a
U-turn to settle
You dead or you do??
Ill tell you its been settled

Gimme dat fire
Gimme dat flame
Gimme dat fresh wind
Gimme dat rain
Gimme dat freedom
You can have the chains
Gimme dat God who can gimme all things

Gimme dat fire, flame
Gimme dat fresh wind
Gimme dat rain
Gimme dat freedom
You can have the chains
Gimme dat God who can gimme all things

So you got platinum?
We got our Lord
If we want, we could ask him
But hes our reward
Gotta be perfect
It cant be three out of four
If youre sick of fallin short
Then he got a cure

Gimme dat cure, dat door, dat hero
Gimme dat grace dat never chased the dinero
How much glory should you give your boy? Zero
That would cause beef with the Lamb like a Gyro

Gimme dat day reaches you over shinin
Truth over rhymin
Virtue over diamonds
Gimme some change
Sometimes I do need the dough
Gimme some pain
Somethin  I do need to grow

Gimme what I wont ask for
Dont gimme what I seek
When I creep, Im a sheep
Gimme your pasture
Gimme life
Just like you intended
Its like to see you raise the day you ascended

Gimme dat fire
Gimme dat flame
Gimme dat fresh wind
Gimme dat rain
Gimme dat freedom
You can have the chains
Gimme dat God who can gimme all things

Gimme dat fire, flame
Gimme dat fresh wind
Gimme dat rain
Gimme dat freedom
You can have the chains
Gimme dat God who can gimme all things

Yeah, this is just to let cats know
Dont focus on what you cant have
Get all you can have
We call dat freedom
Dats the joy of God
And his poeple
In his world
On his terms

Yeah
Gimme dat, gimme dat, gimme dat
I want it all, I want it all
Gimme dat
Its your boy Ambassador---Lyrics submitted by Ross.
