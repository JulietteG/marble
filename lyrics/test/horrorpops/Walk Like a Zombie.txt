You walk like a zombie 
You talk like a zombie 
Its not in your head You're a living dead 
Whatever you're gonna do 
You're gonna make me cry 

And you wanna hold hands In the cemetery 
And you wanna be lost For all eternity 
And everything is dark 
And kind of scary 
And you crave the full moon But i don't care 
And you want a mountaintop With a little castle 
And you wanna name our kids Morticia and fester 
And all the flowers you bring Are always dead 
And you howl at the moon But i don't care 

Six feet under 
You make me wonder 
You wanna be undead So you can be hunted 
But whatever you're gonna do 
I'm gonna follow you---Lyrics submitted by Ashlyn.
