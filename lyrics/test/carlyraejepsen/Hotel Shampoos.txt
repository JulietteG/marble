I survive on hotel shampoos
I'll be running out soon
He's gona away again
Gone to collect some more

Your hands pressed hard into me
Hot fo the summer you'd be
Gone away again
He's gone away again

We were poor
Yeah we were dream chasers
A skyscrapers not too tall
He's gunna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

I'm craving all the gold and the riches
I don't want to wash my own dishes
He's gona away again
He's gone away again

I'm driving in a sweet brand new car
I'm living me the life of a superstar
I got my way again
I got my way again

We were poor
Yeah we were dream chasers
A sky scrappers not too tall
He's gunna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

He says
He don't recognize us
In all our pretty disguises
In all our pretty disguises

Work hard
Yeah we work hard until we're sleeping
And we sleep but we're not dreaming
we sleep but we're not dreaming

Where's his love?
Where's his kisses?
He says "Sorry babe, but this has
Got away from me"
He's gone away from me

We were poor
Yeah we were dream chasers
Babe a sky scrappers not too tall
He's gunna prove me right
I know he'll prove me right
He's gunna prove me right
'til i`m wrong---Lyrics submitted by anais herrera.
