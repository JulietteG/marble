In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
Its the way I feel inside

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

Ill never let you down
And Ill never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Im just a step away

Ill never let you down
And Ill never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Im just a step, just a step, just a step away

Its the beating of your heart
Its the tear I have to hide
Its the sound of your guitar
Its the way I feel inside

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

Ill never let you down
And Ill never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Im just a step away

Ill never let you down
And Ill never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Im just a step, just a step, just a step away

If you need a shoulder
Or someone to hold you
Ill keep my arms open wide
Ill be the one who loves you
Ill be right there by your side

Here we are
Dancing cross this floor together
With every step I take I seem to want you more than ever
You made me love you
Look into my eyes
I want to tell you

Ill never let you down (Ill never let you down)
And Ill never go away (And Ill never go away)
And if your ever feeling down (And if your ever feeling down)
Im just a step away

Ill never let you down
And Ill never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Im just a step away

Ill never let you down
And Ill never go away
And if your ever feeling down
Im just a step, just a step, just a step away

In the space between the words
In the silence of your eyes
In the hands that know the touch
Its the way I feel inside---Lyrics submitted by Zinat Zuaiyria.
