I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me

Say it in a whisper
That baby, it dont get much better
Would I like to see you again?

You name the day
And I will pick the city
Well fly away
Till then, call me when you miss me
If youre asking if Id really like to see you again
I say, Oh just say when!

Tell me that you feel it
This you and me together
No one would believe me
Even I cannot believe it

You kiss me like you mean it
Oh baby, it dont get much better
Would I like to see you again?

Darling just say when

You name the day
And I will pick the city
Well fly away
Till then, call me when you miss me
If youre asking if Id really like to see you again
I say, oh, just say when

Two different worlds
I thought theyd keep us apart
Im ignoring my head
Follow my heart

Oh you pick the day, darling
And I will pick the city
Well fly away
Till then, call me when you miss me
I am willing to wait
Cause I just gotta see you again
So, dont ask, no. Just say when!

Just say when

You name the day
And I will pick the city
We'll fly away
Till then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say, oh

I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me---Lyrics submitted by Helen Devine.
