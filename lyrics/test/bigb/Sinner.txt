[Scott Russo:]
I know, I know, I live the life of a sinner
But when it comes to other women, you're the only one hun so this is the beginning
Let's go, let's go
Let's live the life of a sinner
And we'll be living on the run, right here in the California sun

[Big B:]
First of all I'd like to thank you for accepting this collect call
And to tell you that what you're bout to here is sincere
It's not the drugs or the alcohol
I know you said that it had to end
I don't expect you to bail me out again
But right now girl, you're my only friend
It's true, I did you wrong, for way too long
But that's the past so let's move on
It's a new song, so let it play on and on
From dusk to dawn
'Till the neighbors complain
Or the cops come

[Scott Russo:]
Oh the life of a sinner

[Big B:]
In the California sun

[Scott Russo:]
I know, I know, I live the life of a sinner
But when it comes to other women, you're the only one hun so this is the beginning
Let's go, let's go
Let's live the life of a sinner
And we'll be living on the run, right here in the California sun

[Big B:]
I wouldn't blame you if you just hung up
I understand that you're getting fed up
I can't say that this is the last time that this will happen
But I try, oh yes, I try
I say I wanna change, but I lie, oh yes I lie
And you know I stay consistent, yeah I ain't perfect but at least I admit it
And I ain't never gonna change, and don't forget it.

[Scott Russo:]
I know, I know, I live the life of a sinner
But when it comes to other women, you're the only one hun so this is the beginning
Let's go, let's go
Let's live the life of a sinner
And we'll be living on the run, right here in the California sun

Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

[Big B:]
Why don't you come and take a trip on the dark side
Just me and you sitting side by side
You can't knock [? ] until you seen it
I said this'd be the last time but this time I mean it
So let your head down, let your shoes get dirty
Let's take it slow yo there's no need to hurry
I'm a hold your hand the whole way so girl don't worry
No, don't worry

Da da da da da da No don't worry da da da da da da da da da da da da

[Scott Russo:]
I know, I know, I live the life of a sinner
But when it comes to other women, you're the only one hun so this is the beginning
Let's go, let's go
Let's live the life of a sinner
And we'll be living on the run, right here in the California sun
Let's go, let's go
Let's live the life of a sinner
And we'll be living on the run, right here in the California sun---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
