Whod-a guessed that Aquanette
Could start a fire with a single cigarette
She wasnt drunk, she wasnt stoned
Just sick and tired of wonderin when he was coming home
So she drove around
She found his car
They heard a boom from in the bar
He called the cops
She called his bluff
They hauled her off in high heels and handcuffs

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden till theyre pushed off the deep end
Oh yea, God forgive them, they werent born like this
Oh no, crazy women are made by crazy men

He told his friends she was depressed
Borderline bi-polar, bitch with PMS
Well he cheats and lies and then plays the victim
He dont know why they always seem to pick him

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden till theyre pushed off the deep end
Oh yea, God forgive them, they werent born like this
Oh no, crazy women are made by crazy men

Some take a pistol, some take an axe
Boy if you feel the fire, you damn well bet shes got a match
Might be the teacher just down the street
The hairdresser or the housewife or the waitress thats so sweet
No you wont see it when you meet em
So be careful how you treat em
She might look just like me

Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden till theyre pushed off the deep end
Oh yea, God forgive them, they werent born like this
God knows, crazy women are made by crazy crazy crazy
Crazy women are made by crazy men ---
