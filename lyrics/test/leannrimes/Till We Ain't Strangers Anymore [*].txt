It might be hard to be lovers,
But it's harder to be friends.
Baby pull down the covers,
It's time to let me in.
Maybe light a couple candles,
I go ahead and lock the door.
If you just talk to me baby,
Till we aint strangers anymore.

Lay your head on my pillow,
I sit beside you on the bed.
Don't you think it's time to say,
Some things we haven't said.
It aint to late to get back to that place,
Back to where, we thought it was before.
Why don't you look at me,
Till we ain't strangers anymore.

Sometimes it's hard to love me,
Sometimes it's hard to love you too.
I know it's hard believing,
That love can pull us through.
It would be so easy. To live your life,
with one foot out the door.
Just hold me baby,
till we ain't strangers anymore.

[solo]
It's hard to find forgiveness,
when we just ran out of lies.
It's hard to say you're sorry
when you can't tell wrong from right.
It would be so easy,
To spend your whole damn life,
just keeping score.
So let's get down to it baby,
there's no need to lie.

Tell me who you think you see, 
when you look into my eyes.
let's put our two hearts back together,
and we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor,
Make love with me baby,
till we ain't strangers anymore.

We're not strangers anymore,
we're not strangers,
We're not strangers anymore!---Lyrics submitted by Jacque.
