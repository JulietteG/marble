Take back the holy and mistletoe,
silver bells on a string.

If I wrote a letter to Santa Clause
I would ask for just one thing.

I don't need sleigh rides in the snow,
I don't want a christmas thats blue.

Take back the tinsle, stockings and bows,
Cause all I want for christmas is you.

I don't need expensive things,
they don't matter to me.

All I want can't be found, 
underneth the christmas tree .

You are the angel that tops my tree,
You are my dream come true.

No santa can't bring me, what I needa,
Cause all I want for christmas is you.

I don't need expensive things,
they don't matter to me.

All I want can't be found, 
underneth the christmas tree .

You are the angel that tops my tree,
You are my dream come true.
No Santa can't bring me what I needa,
cause all I want for christmas is you,
all I want for christmas is you,
Yeah all I want for christmas       
is you.---Lyrics submitted by richard.
