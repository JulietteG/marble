Under a lover's sky
Gonna be with you
And no ones gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall
Well just wait until
Til the sun goes down

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling so right
It'll steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight
No, you cant fight it
It's gonna get to your heart

There's no escape from love
Once a gentle breeze
Weaves its spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It wont be too long
Til your in my arms
Underneath the starlight , starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight
No, you cant fight it
No matter what you do
The night is gonna get to you

Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Dont try
You're never gonna win. oh

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling so right
It will steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know that
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight
No, you cant fight it

You can try to resist
(Try to resist my kiss)
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know
Dont you know that you cant fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know
But you know that you cant fight the moonlight
No, you cant fight it
Its gonna get to your heart---Lyrics submitted by Dee.
