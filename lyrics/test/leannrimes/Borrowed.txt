I know youre not mine, only borrowed
Cause you already belong to her, at least you said so
But Im starting to believe it aint the whole truth
As were lying side by side, I get the whole you

I Wanna hold out, but gotta hold on,
Even though I know its wrong
Cause I dont want to give you back
I dont want to give you back
Youre the best Ill never have
So I dont want to give you back
But youre borrowed

Do you tell her that you love her?
Like you do me?
Do you make love to her,
The way you make love to me?
Well I keep myself alone in case you call tonight
Its pathetic how I lie around
And wait all the damn time
Its a short hide and long low,
Every time you have to go

Cause I dont want to give you back
I dont want to give you back
Youre the best Ill never have
So I dont want to give you back
But youre borrowed
Only borrowed

How much time is left and you dont return?
And you dont return?
How much time?
Oh its no return, no return, how much time?

I know youre not mine, only borrowed
And I dont want to give you back
I dont want to give you back
Youre the best Ill never have
So I dont want to give you back
No I dont want to give you back
No I dont want to give you back
Youre the best Ill never have
So I dont want to give you back
But youre borrowed, only borrowed,
Cause youre borrowed---
