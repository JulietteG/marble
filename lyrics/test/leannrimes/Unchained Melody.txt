Oh, my love, my darling 
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
As time goes by so slowly
That time can do so much

Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea, yeah
Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for me"
I'll be coming home wait for me

Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered, hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And i know the time goes by so slowly
That time can do so much

Are you still mine?
I need your love 
I need your love
God speed your love to me---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
