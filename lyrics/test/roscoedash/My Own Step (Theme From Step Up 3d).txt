I got my own steps
I got my own style x4

I can get this party started,
Watch how a nigguh do it x4

I got my own steps
I got my own style x4

I can get this party started,
Watch how a nigguh do it x4

I got my own step
I got my own style
And if a nigga keep stealing it from me
Then Ima have to go wild

Yeah better back up on
One of these jays trying to jack up on
Cause all these nigguhs in the club
must really wanna see a motherf****er act up or
clap clap clap clap on

Moving on dance floor then
Ill take your
Whore to the motel
And if I perfom well
Thats gonna give her more to tell you
Just what we doing
You dont really need to
Know who shes screwing,
Homie
If she get this dick again
You will never fit again

Slippin in and out
I got my own step
My own shit

Put that tongue on that
It left her in bed like
Oh shit, Oh its
Just another one of them classic T-Pain antics
Got em making up brand new dances
She get low to the ground like ants is

Every time I put on that terrace
All she think about is marriage
Homie you cant pull no hoes
Youre like a horse without a carriage

I dont even know how many carrots in my chain
Nigguh you gonna have to explain
That nobody on the corner
Got swagger like us
So you got yours from T-pain

I got my own steps
I got my own style x4

I can get this party started,
Watch how a nigga do it x4---Lyrics submitted by Marquavis.
