One two three
No where, yeah were going no where, fast
Maybe, this time Ill be yours youll be mine
c-c-c-crazy, get your ass in my bed
baby, youll be my summer boy-friend
(summerboy)
lets get lost you can take me home
somewhere nice we can be alone
rocking it out, coming of
dont be sad when the sun goes down, you wake up and Im not around
youve got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
well still have the summer after all
oh
sometimes, you might start a fight
but im happy pretending were all right
(all right)
sunglasses, cover up my green eyes
my martini glistens yeah, while checking out other guys.
(summer boy)
lets get lost you can take me home
somewhere nice we can be alone
rocking it out, coming of
dont be sad when the sun goes down, you wake up and Im not around
youve got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
well still have the summer after all
oh
hey there summer boy
lets go for a drive
take me for a ride never going to close our eyes
hey there summer boy
im a busy girl, dont got too much time
hurry up before I change my mind
hey there summer boy
im taking of my heels
lets go for a run have a little summer fun have a little summer fun
summer boy
lets get lost you can take me home
somewhere nice we can be alone
rocking it out, coming of
dont be sad when the sun goes down, you wake up and Im not around
youve got to go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
well still have the summer after 
lets get lost you can take me home
somewhere nice we can be alone
ive got my summer summer boy
dont be sad when the sun goes down, you wake up and Im not around
ive got my summer summer boy
well still have the summer after all
