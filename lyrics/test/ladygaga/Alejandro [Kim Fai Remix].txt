She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you
Won't look you at
She hides through love
en su bolsillo
She got a halo around her finger
Around you

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to loose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke one cigarette more
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Just stop
Please, Just let me go
Alejandro, Just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad
Draw those flames that burn before him
Now he's gonna find a fight, gonna fool the bad

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to loose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke one cigarette and run
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

Dont bother me
Dont bother me, Alejandro
Dont call my name
Dont call my name, Bye Fernando
I'm not you're babe
I'm not you're babe, Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch,
Fernando

Dont call my name
Dont call my name, Alejandro
I'm not you're babe
I'm not you're babe, Fernando

Don't wanna kiss don't wanna touch.
Just smoke one Ciggarette and run.
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto.

Just Smoke one Ciggarette and run.
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto.
