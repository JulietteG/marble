Let's have some fun
this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's have some fun 
this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

I wanna kiss you
But if I do they'd know I miss you babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid
Guess he wants to play
Aants to play
A love game
A love game

(Chorus)
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Baby 3 seconds is enough for my heart to quit

Let's have some fun this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that thick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame
Are you in the game

Dans le love game

Let's play a love game
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame 
Are you in the game

Dans le love game
(End)

I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touchin', yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex yes,
And now I want it bad
Want it bad
A love game
A love game

(Chorus)

I can see you
Starin' there from accross the block
With a smile on your mouth
And your hand on your (HUH!)
The story of us it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a (HUH!)
And a game

And a game
And a game
And a game
A loooove game
