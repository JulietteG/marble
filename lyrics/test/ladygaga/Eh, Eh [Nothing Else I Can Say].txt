Boom boom
GaGa

Boy, we've had a real' good time
And I wish you the best on your way
Eh eh
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall out of place
Eh eh, hey ey

I have something ***
But my friends keeping telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And babe, there's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh

Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so complicated
Eh eh
I met somebody cute and finally got each other
And that's funny
Eh eh, hey ey

I have something ***
But my friends keeping telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And babe, there's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh

(Eh eh, eh eh, eh eh...)

I have something ***
But my friends keeping telling me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And babe, there's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh

There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh
I wish you'd never looked at me that way
Eh eh, eh eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh eh, eh eh

(Cherry cherry, boom boom)

Eh eh, hey ey
Oh yeah

All I can say is eh eh---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
