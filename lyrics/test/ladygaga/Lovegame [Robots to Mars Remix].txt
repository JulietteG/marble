Let's have some fun,
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's have some fun, 
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

I wanna kiss you
But if I do then I might miss you babe 
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy cupid
Guess he wants to play,
Wants to play
A love game
A love game

Hold me and love me
Just want touch you for a minute
Baby three seconds is enough for my heart to quit

Let's have some fun, 
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game, 
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans le love game? (x2)

I'm on a mission,
And it involves some heavy touchin' yeah.
You've indicated your interest,
I'm educated in sex yes
And now I want it bad,
Want it bad.
A love game,
A love game.

Hold me and love me.
Just want to touch you for a minute.
Baby three seconds is enough for my heart to quit.

Let's have some fun, 
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a love game, 
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans le love game? (x2)

I couldn't see you staring there from across the block with a smile on your mouth 
and our hand on your huh 
The story of us it always starts the same with a boy and a girl and a huh and a game!
And a game
And a game
And a game
A love game! 

Let's play a love game, 
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? 
Dans le love game? (x4)

Let's have some fun,
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick---Lyrics submitted by Noelle.
