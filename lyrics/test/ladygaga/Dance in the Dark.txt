[Intro]
Hahaaaa!
Silicone, saline, poison, inject me.
Baby, I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch

[Verse 1]
Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
Won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, She's a mess, She's a mess, She's a mess

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz' when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, there's a dance in the dark
Dance

[Verse 2]
remember his kiss is a vampire grin
the moonlight's away while she's howlin' at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says shes a tramp
She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still kills the dance
Kill em'

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz' when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, She Loves to dance in the dark
Dance

[Bridge]
She loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
She love, she loves to dance in the dark.

Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia, tell them how you feel girls.
Work your ass Benet Ramsey haunt like liberachi
Find your freedom in the music
Find your jesus, find your cupid
You will never fall apart Diana
You're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark

[Chorus]
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz' when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Cuz when he's looking she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, there's a dance in the dark
