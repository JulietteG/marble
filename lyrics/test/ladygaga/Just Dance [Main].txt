I've had a little bit too much
All of the people start to rush.
Start to rush babe.
How does he twist the dance? 
Can't find my drink or man.
Where are my keys, I lost my phone.
What's go-ing out on the floor? 
I love this record baby, but I can't see straight anymore.
Keep it cool what's the name of this club? 
I can't remember but it's alright, alright.

[Chorus:]
Just dance. Gunna be okay.
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance. Spin that record babe.
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance. Gunna be okay.
Duh-duh-duh-duh
Dance. Dance. Dance. Ju-just dance.

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth.
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside out babe.
Control your poison babe
Roses with thorns they say.
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight.
What's go-ing out on the floor? 
I love this record baby, but I can't see straight anymore.
Keep it cool what's the name of this club? 
I can't remember but it's alright, alright.

[Chorus]

When I come through on the dance floor checkin out that catalogue.
Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw.
And I ain't gonn' give it up, steady tryna pick it up like the car
I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it and flex until the til done until tomorr' yeah.
Show me I can see that you got so much in the jean
The way you twirling up them hips round and round
There's no reason, I know why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime stand, let me watch you break it down.

[Chorus]

I'm psychotic synchypnotic
I got my blue burners and phonic
I'm psychotic synchypnotic
I got my brand electronic
I'm psychotic synchypnotic
I got my blue burners and phonic
I'm psychotic synchypnotic
I got my brand electronic

Go. Use your muscle comin out work and hustle
I got it, just stay close enough to get it
Go slow. Drive it, clean it like so clean it's been molesto, I got it, and your popped coll'
