Tell Me again how we're easily forgettable
So formulaic and way too simple to be
at all original, yea so we've heard
It's time to keep your mouth shut
While we show you how to rock-n-roll

Tell me again how we're so unrecognizable
A stolen guide to your best of best cds
And whoa, we know this is the hook
So bring on mixed reviews

This chords not played out yet
There's a lot more that
they're not letting on
And whoa, we know you'll have no
scene left when it's done

We won't back down
You know that we can do this
With or without you
With or without you

To all your friends who make rules
We wrote them
To those who prey on hearts of fools
We broke them

This chords not played out yet
There's a lot more that
they're not letting on
And whoa, we know you'll have no
scene left when it's done

We won't back down
You know that we can do this
With or without you
With or without you
We won't back down
You know that we can do this
With or without you
With or without you

Taking what we can
We're modern day cut-throats
We're breaking all your plans
Staking out every road
Taking what we can (We won't back down)
We're modern day cut-throats (You
know that we can do this)
We're breaking all your plans
(With or without you)
Staking out every road (With or without you)

We won't back down
You know that we can do this
With or without you
With or without you
We won't back down
You know that we can do this
With or without you
With or without you---Lyrics submitted by halie.
