I can't hear you, you sound like static
I can't hear you my ears have had it bad
you sound like a...

Radio with the speakers blown
the treble high and the base down low
down low

Tonight I'm drowning in my favorite records
trying to forget how every thread
reminds me of the nights I spent with you

They play the soundtrack to my falling tears
the soundtrack to this wasted year
and the sleeves hide scars better than I could ever do

So turn me up when you turn me on
when we hear hearts break we'll say they're playing our song

It sounds like a radio with the speakers blown
the kind of sound that you'll never know
treble high and the base down low
whoa oh whoa oh
Radio with the speakers blown
the kind of sound that you'll never know
treble high and the base down low
whoa oh

The record plays to the beat of my heart
and my heart you know it plays like a metronome
if the record skips a beat my heart will too

It plays the soundtrack to my falling tears
the soundtrack to this wasted year
and the sleeves hide scars better than I could ever do

So turn me up when you turn me on
when we hear hearts break we'll say they're playing our song

It sounds like a radio with the speakers blown
the kind of sound that you'll never know
treble high and the base down low
whoa oh whoa oh
Radio with the speakers blown
the kind of sound that you'll never know
treble high and the base down low
whoa oh

So I'll break these record you've always hated
I'm feeling so sick and medicated
aw come on why are you so nervous boy
my prescriptions read like ransom notes
and love letters you never wrote
help me feel like I'm not paranoid

I can't hear you, you sound like static
I can't hear you my ears have had it bad
it sounds like a...

Radio with the speakers blown
treble high and the base down low
down low

It sounds like a radio with the speakers blown
the kind of sound that you'll never know
treble high and the base down low
whoa oh whoa oh

Radio with the speakers blown
the kind of sound that you'll never know
treble high and the base down low
whoa oh
treble high and the base down low---Lyrics submitted by Ray.
