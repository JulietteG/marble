I've been carving
down the days on
my bedroom door
Teeth are all but gum, 
takin' a beating from
grinding when im sleeping

I busted out the boards
on my window sill, nailed
shut to keep me here i'm dying
nothing can stop
from trying

to claw my way out this 
grave, before i decay i 
will make a clean break

and burn it down

I'll burn this town
behind me and run
until i can't breate

I'm breaking out, I'll bury
all my mistakes and
rebuild until my back
breaks

consider them 
convinced i'm a
lunatic

eyes are wide and
crazed, i'm feeling hell
ben't on wreaking havoc

send a stack of brick 
through the neighbors 
house, watch them as 
they spill into their yards

they don't know 
how lucky they are

they swat the vultures
aside and swear they're
alive but just look in their 
eyes

burn it down

I'll burn this town
behind me and run
until i can't breathe

I'm breaking out, I'll bury
all my mistakes and
rebuild until my back
breaks, down

on my gravestone
for all to see it reads
"i took this city out,
at the knees" at least

on your gravestone
covered in leaves they'll
read nothing more than 
"rest rest in peace"

Nothing more than
Nothing more than
Nothing more than 
Nothing more than

burn it down

I'll burn this town
behind me and run
until i can't breathe

baby I'm breaking out,
i'll bury all my mistakes 
and rebuild until my back
breaks

DOWN
DOWN

rebuild until my 
back breaks

rebuild until my 
back breaks
until my back 
breaks

"i took this city out,
at the knees---Lyrics submitted by Travis.
