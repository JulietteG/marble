Ole ole - ole ole 

EE-Yessa Ha-ha 
Ee-yes girls 

Me mind on fire 
Me soul on fire 
Feeling hot hot hot 
Party people 
All around me feeling hot hot hot 
What to do - On a night like this 
Music sweet - I can't resist 
We need a party song - A fundamental jam 

So we go rum-bum-bum-bum 
Yeah we rum-bum-bum-bum 
Feeling hot hot hot 
Feeling hot hot hot 
Oh Lord 

(Me la la la lum bum bum) 

See people rocking 
Hear people chanting 
Feeling hot hot hot 
Keep up this spirit 
Come on let's do it 
Feeling hot hot hot 
It's in the air 
Celebration time 
Music sweet 
Captivate your mind 
We have this party song 
This fundamental jam 

So we go rum-bum-bum-bum 
Yeah we rum-bum-bum-bum 
Feeling hot hot hot 
Feeling hot hot hot 
Oh Lord
