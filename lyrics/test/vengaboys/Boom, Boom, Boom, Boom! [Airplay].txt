f you're alone and you need a friend
Someone to make you forget your problems
Just come along baby
Take my hand
I'll be your lover tonight
whoaaa whoaaa
This is what I wanna do
whoaa whoaa
Let's have some fun
whoaa whoaa
one on one just me and you

Boom boom boom
I want you in my room
we'll spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom boom
I wanna go boom boom
and spend the night together,
Together in my room

Everybody get on down
The Vengaboys are back in town
This is what I wanna do
whoaaa whoaa
Let's have some fun
whoaa whoaa
one on one just me and you

Boom boom boom 
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever

Boom boom boom 
I wanna go boom boom
and spend the night together,
Together in my room

Boom boom boom 
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever

Boom boom boom
I wanna go boom boom
and spend the night together,
Together in my room
Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever---Lyrics submitted by Pratik.
