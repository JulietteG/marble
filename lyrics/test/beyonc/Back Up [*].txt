CHORUS
When you see that girl coming back up (up)
She aint your average chic back up (up)
This is for the the the club
And this is for the people of the the the club

When you see that girl coming back up (up)
She aint your average chic back up (up)
This is for the the the club
And this is for the people of the the the club

She aint the average chic 
She the baddest chic
She aint the average chic 
She the baddest chic

Verse 1
Everybody know that face
Even with her head low they still know that shape
When she come through the club
People take their place
Chics throwing handcuffs
Cause they knowing that they man aint safe

Cause she the one switching up flows
If its four door  two gotta go
Chics like what kinda jeans is those
And fellas watching like please get low

CHORUS

Verse 2
Everbody cant do this
Some aint got a clue 
Till they hear me spit
Hachue I spue cause your girl is sick
Is it the chance of the hip 
You can tell but you know its thick

Cause she the one switching up flows
If its four door  two gotta go
Chics like what kinda jeans is those
And fellas watching like please get low (ohhhh)

CHORUS

Verse 3
For this type of girl its not that hard
-You see her cause shes too far gone
Though they pray and pray for her theyll fall
Why they gotta be so envious
Doing what it do may be a plus
BACK UP CONTINUED

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

Back up

When you see that girl coming back up (up)
She aint your average chic back up (up)
This is for the the the club
And this is for the people of the the the club

When you see that girl coming back up (up)
She aint your average chic back up (up)
This is for the the the club
And this is for the people of the the the club

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
