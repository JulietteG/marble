At first we started out real cool
Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you
Who don't know what a man's about

Chorus: Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through

Now you've been maxing out my cards
Givin' me bad credit, buyin' gifts with my own name
Haven't paid the first bill
But your steady heading to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees
Perpertrating to your friends that you be ballin'

And then you use my cell phone
Calling whoever you thinks at home
And then when the bill comes
All the sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your mama's number's here more than once

You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you
Who don't know what a man's about

Chorus
Bridge 4x
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another

Chorus: Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Can you pay my automo bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
