(Hook:)
Ring the alarm, 
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm 
Won't you ring the alarm 
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm 

(Chorus;)
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats 
If I let you go
Bitch in the house on the coast 
If I let you go
She gon' take everythin' I own 
If I let you go
I can't let you go, 
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones 
If I let you go 
Cruise in the 'bach or the Rolls 
If I let you go
She gon' prophit everything I taught 
If I let you go
I can't let you go, 
Damn, if I let you go

(Verse 1:)
Tell me, how should I feel 
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition 
Tellin' me you're a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames, 
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gon' choke?

(Pre-Chorus 1:)
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spendin your dough
This is takin' it's toll, the way the stoy unfolds 
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would've saw

(Chorus)

(Hook)

(Verse 2:)
Tell me how should I feel 
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touchin' her 
Is what I hate most
I don't want you, 
But I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me. 
Come on!

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
