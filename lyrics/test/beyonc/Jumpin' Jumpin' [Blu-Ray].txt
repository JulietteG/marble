Ladies leave your man at home 
The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown 
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends 
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin' 

Boy say he got a girl 
Yeah true you got a man 
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So let's make it hot, hot 

Last weekend you stayed at home alone and lonely 
Couldn't find your man, he was chillin' with his homies 
This weekend you're going out 
If he try to stop you, you you goin' off 
You got your hair done and your nails done too 
yo new outfit and your Fendi shoes 
And when you're through partying' at the hottest spot 
Tonight you're gonna find the fellas 
Rollin' in the Lexus, trucks and Hummers 

Boy say he got a girl 
Yeah it's true you got a man 
But the party ain't gon' stop 
So let's make it hot, hot 

All you Ladies leave your man at home 
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown 
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends 
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Call your boys cause tonight you're not gonna stay at home 
and she tell your girl she ain't comin' tonight

Cut her off cause she talk some noise 
You know you got the right to get your party on 
So get your haircut and your car washed too 
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit 
You need to look your best cause you're turnin' heads tonight 
You're gonna find a sexy chica that's gonna dance all night 
If you wanna
