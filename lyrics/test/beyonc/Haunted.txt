It's what you do
It's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

My wicked tongue
Where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you
I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You're lucky
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me!
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, fuck me

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me

My wicked tongue
Where will it be
I know if I'm onto you
You must be onto me

It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)
You must be onto me (on to you, I'm on to you)

Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)
Me (on to you, I'm on to you)

What goes up, ghost around
Goes around around around around
What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around around around around---
