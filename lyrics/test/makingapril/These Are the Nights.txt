Our bodies to hand with the Jersey shoreline
Connecting the tide to the sand that was dry
And we both laid entwined, stared at the night
Clouds overhead, but that was all right
Cause then and there with the wind in your hair
Heaven was jealous to merely look fair against you
And all I need now is for this moon to keep light in it's desolate skyline for good

Cause these are the nights that you know when you're there
You couldnt have planned it much better I swear and you hope
That your senses aren't failing you now
And you think to yourself now I could be wrong
But I might have just stolen this scene from a song and you know
That your senses aren't failing you now, but they're slipping away

So divine is this happening
Cant I just graze your skin
For the rest of our time
But time isn't letting this night go on
Till then and there, the wind in your hair
Nothing in this world could keep me from staring at you
And all I need now is for that sun to stay under it's glowing horizon for good, whoaoaoa

Cause these are the nights that you know when you're there
You couldnt have planned it much better I swear and you hope
That your senses aren't failing you now
And you think to yourself now I could be wrong
But I might have just stolen this scene from a song and you know
That your senses aren't failing you now

Failing you now
You could get lost in a night like this
So empty your thoughts and open your heart to the bliss
These are the nights, these are the nights
These are the nights, these are the nights---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
