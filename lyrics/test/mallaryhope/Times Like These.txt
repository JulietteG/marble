Yeah
got your hand on the wheel
with my bare feet up on the dash board
we're talking and snacking on gas station food
as the signs roll by
can't recall the last time
i laughed this hard
there were tears in my eyes.
catching my breath cuz of what you just said
i think to myself,
it don't get better than this.

so soak it in, eat it up, 
close our eyes
let the sun kiss our skin
take it in and drive
love is a highway and
baby we're on it
here in the moment
while you're laughing w/ me
don't you just wish we could freeze 
times like these

Music on, 
some old song
neither one of us know 
but we try to sing along
we're making up the words 
and it's turned up loud
top of our lungs 
with the windows down

so soak it in, eat it up, 
close our eyes
let the sun kiss our skin
take it in and drive
love is a highway and
baby we're on it
here in the moment
while you're laughing w/ me
don't you just wish we could freeze 
times like these.

time goes by as fast as the wheels on the pavement.

Fly.............

hey won't you drive
love is a highway and
baby we're on it
here in the moment
while you're laughing w/ me
don't you just wish we could freeze 
times like 
times like these
and love these time like these---Lyrics submitted by Donna.
