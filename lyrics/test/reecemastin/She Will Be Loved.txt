Beauty queen of only 18,
she has some troubles with herself,
you were always there to help her,
She always belonged to someone else,

I drove her miles and miles
and wound up at her door,
I had you so many times but 
somehow i want more

And i dont mind spending everyday
out in your garden in the pouring rain
look for a girl with a broken smile
and a ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

Tap on my window
Knock on my front door
I wana make you feel beautiful
I know i tend to get so insecure
doesnt matter anymore
Its not always rainbows and butterflys

my heart is broken
my doors always open
you can come anythime you want
