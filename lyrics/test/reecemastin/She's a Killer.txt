All dressed up in red
Shes a killer
Gonna knock em dead
With the finger on the trigger
But she dont tip-toe when she walks
And she dont whisper when she talks
Because she got it like that
Yea, she got it like that

The first time we met
I said excuse me miss
And then she pulled me close
And killed me with a kiss

Shes a blonde haired, bombshell, long leg spider
Whos been working on her web all day
Shes a blue eyed, smoking 9, 6 feet shooter
Whos tryina make me obey

Shes a killer, shes a killer
My baby is a killer, shes a killer
And someones gonna die today

Do do do
Do do do
Do do doooo

Shes a movie star
A late night thriller
Always leaves her mark
Like a cold blooded murder
She got lips like loaded guns
So we all die one by one
Because she got it like that
Yea she got it like that

The first time we met
I said excuse me miss
And then she pulled me close
And killed me with a kiss

Shes a blonde haired, bombshell, long leg spider
Whos been working on her web all day
Shes a blue eyed, smoking 9, 6 feet shooter
Whos tryina make me obey

Shes a killer, shes a killer
My baby is a killer, shes a killer
And someones gonna die today

If you see her in the street
Look the other way
Cause shell take your heart, rip it apart
And put it on display
Shes got a filthy appetite
Dont get in her way
Shes a crowd pleaser, a man eater
And always brings her parade

Shes a blonde haired, bombshell, long leg spider
Whos been working on her web all day
Shes a blue eyed, smoking 9, 6 feet shooter
Whos tryina make me obey

Shes a killer, shes a killer
My baby is a killer, shes a killer
And someones gonna die today---Lyrics submitted by lil rocker.
