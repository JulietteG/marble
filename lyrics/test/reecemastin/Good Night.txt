I got my T-shirt and sneakers on
No one to mess around with fate
It feels so wrong
Im gonna live it up tonight
Forgetting those who dim my light

Lets go back to Rock and Roll
And people just let go
And let the music flow

Im just looking for a good night, oh
Im not looking for the right time, no
What I really want to say to you right now
Shut your mouth and let the music speak out loud
Im just looking for a good night

I think you get the picture now
Yeah, I think you know
What Im all about
I got no time for fools
Who think theyre playing cool
My ears have tuned you out

Lets go back to Rock and Roll
When people just let go
And let the music flow

Im just looking for a good night, oh
Im not looking for the right time, no
What I really want to say to you right now
Shut your mouth and let the music speak out loud
Im just looking for a good night, oh
Im not looking for the right time, no
What I really want to do is shut you up
Cause all you do is talk and talk and thats enough

Now were gonna get up
Now were gonna get up
Just let yourself lose control
Let the music take hold
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Its time that you know how to let it go

Lets go back to Rock and Roll
Where the music just flows
And everybody knows

Im just looking for a good night, oh
Im not looking for the right time, no
What I really want to say to you right now
Shut your mouth and let the music speak out loud
Im just looking for a good night, oh
Im not looking for the right time, no
What I really want to do is shut you up
Cause all you do is talk and talk and thats enough

Im just looking for a good night ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
