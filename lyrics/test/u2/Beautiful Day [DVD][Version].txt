The heart is a bloom, shoots up through stony ground
But there's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care,
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere.
You thought youd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace


It's a beautiful day,
the sky falls And you feel like 
it's a beautiful day,
Dont let it get away


Youre on the road but youve got no destination
Youre in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesnt ring true
Youve been all over and its been all over you


It's a beautiful day,
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day,

Touch me, take me to that other place
Teach me love, I know Im not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
A beautiful day


Touch me, take me to that other place
Reach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you dont have you dont need it now
What you dont know you can feel it somehow
What you dont have you dont need it now
You dont need it now---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
