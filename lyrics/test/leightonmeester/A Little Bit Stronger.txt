I woke up late today and I still feel the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
Got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger

Riding in the car to work and I'm trying to ignore the hurt
So I turned on the radio, stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for minute but I changed it
I'm getting a little bit stronger, just a little bit stronger

And I'm done hoping that we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
I'm done thinking that you could ever change

I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

Doesn't happen overnight and then you turn around
And a month's gone by and you realize you haven't cried
I'm not giving you a hour or a second
Or another minute longer, I'm busy getting stronger

I'm done hoping that we can work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
I'm done thinking, that you could ever change

I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger, just a little bit stronger

I'm getting along without you, baby
I'm better off without you, baby
How does it feel without me, baby?
I'm getting stronger without you, baby

I'm done hoping that we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
And letting you drag my heart around
I'm done thinking that you could ever change

I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

Just a little bit stronger
I get a little bit stronger
A little bit, a little bit, a li---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
