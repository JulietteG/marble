VERSE 1:
I like it
I want it
The way you make my body move
I think Im addicted 
Im high off everything you do
Im going to call you, baby 
Dont you worry about the things?
Cause youre all I need

BRIDGE:
Ive become a slave to my habit
Fiending for your love
Gotta have it now

CHORUS:
Youre all I need
Your loves a drug
Cant get enough
Your loves a drug
And I cant sleep
Cant get enough 
Your loves a drug
Your loves a drug

Your loves a

VERSE 2:
I need it
That feeling
Rushing through my veins again
Whenever youre leaving
I feel withdrawal kicking in
Im going to tell you how I feel
How I couldnt breath
When youre not with me

REPEAT BRIDGE

REPEAT CHORUS

Your loves a drug
Cause I miss you when youre gone
So right but feels so wrong
And I need to have you all the time

REPEAT CHORUS 2x

Your loves a drug---Lyrics submitted by MacKenzie.
