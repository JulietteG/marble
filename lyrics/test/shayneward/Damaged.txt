oooooooh damaged.....no...no...

Remember those photographs we took on the boat in Spain
I took them down and ripped them up and threw them all away
Remember on the back of one you wrote we would meant to be
That doesn't really matter now cause you don't mean a thing to me

Baby you should have told me, told me from the start
I thought that I was your only, till you put me on the shelf and found somebody else

(CHORUS)
I never thought that you would ever do that everything we had is gone
You said you loved me said you'd never leave me maybe I just heard you wrong
cause i'm damaged, i'm damaged, don't know what to do, baby
I'm damaged so..so damaged because of you

Got rid of those clothes you left like you got rid of our dreams
Don't wanna be reminded of all of the memories
I used to have the ticket stamp saved from our very first date
But that don't really matter now cause you threw our love away

Baby you should have told me cause now i'm torn apart
Thougt that I was your only 'till you put me on the shelf and found somebody else

(CHORUS)

It's almost like you were never here
I almost feel like I don't care...girl, I've almost got rid of all the pain
The only thing I've left to say...girl, is that how good you leave me so damaged

damaged...oooh no no...oh no...

Girl I never thought, I never thought, never thought that you'd do that everything is gone 
(everything is gone)
You said you loved me and said you'd never leave me maybe I just heard you wrong
(maybe I just heard you wrong)
