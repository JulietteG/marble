I won't let myself out there again
And I have to face the truth, no more pretend
Oh it kills me inside to let you go
But I have to move on you hurt me so
I am seeing through you and I won't take no more

I have been foolish won't be running back this time (don't even try)
I've been so foolish so now I am paying the price (this is goodbye)
Can't believe that we've just fell apart
Never thought that you would break my heart
I've been so foolish
I just had to open my eyes (to realize)
I have been foolish

You'd be only mine if I never left
And that's the promise that you never cared
Oh it kills me inside to let you go
But I have to move on you hurt me so
I am seeing through you and I won't take no more

I have been foolish won't be running back this time (don't even try)
I've been so foolish so now I am paying the price (this is goodbye)
Can't believe that we've just fell apart
Never thought that you would break my heart
I've been so foolish
I just had to open my eyes (to realize)
I have been foolish

I have been foolish won't be running back this time
I've been so foolish so now I am paying the price
Ahhhh

I have been foolish won't be running back this time (don't even try)
I've been so foolish so now I am paying the price (this is goodbye)
Can't believe that we've just fell apart
Never thought that you would break my heart
I've been so foolish
I just had to open my eyes (to realize)
I have been foolish
Oh yeah
I have been foolish ---Lyrics submitted by zaw.
