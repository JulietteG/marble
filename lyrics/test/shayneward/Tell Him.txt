I woke up this morning you know
I had a shocker
See it finally hit me how much
I truly love ya
Stumbling out of bed
I grabbed my phone and called ya
But you were MIA so I decided
to stay right here
Picked up a pen before I knew I had it
Hand written letter to you
with some Vivaldi magic
See every love before this
I had was truly tragic
That's why i'm happy to say

[Chorus]
Hey I think it's time you
be telling your boyfriend
Exactly what you and I've been doing
Tell him
The End
Don't know how much more I can take
Hey nows the time to be telling
your boyfriend
About all of the time we'r spending
Tell him
The end
Baby hey hey hey hey

Now running catching a cab 'cause I just have
to see ya
I tell the driver to drive like
it's gon' break his meter
(I tell him don't stop)

Before I go an furture I gotta tell ya
I ain't never acted quite like this
You done a number on me

I swear you're everything I ever wanted
I've got so much love to give
you don't understand
Now i'm right outside your door
Rode up forty floors gotta hold you touch you

[Chorus]

It's what you do
You're killing me
I can feel there's something differenrt
How you make me feel no accident
Felt you girl
so please
this should come as no surprise

[Chorus]

Something you should know
Cause its killing me
Girl are you listening
Go on and tell him
'Cause I can't wait no more
