Nothing's impossible
Nothing's unreachable
When I am weary
You make me stronger
This love is beautiful
So unforgettable
I feel no winter cold
When we're together
When we're together

[chorus]
Will you stand by me?
Hold on and never let me go
Will you stand by me?
With you I know I belong
When the story gets told

When day turns into night
I look into your eyes
I see my future now
All the world and its wonder

This love wont fade away
And through the hardest days
I'll never question us
You are the reason
My only reason

Will you stand by me?
Hold on and never let me go
Will you stand by me?
With you I know I belong
When the story gets told

I am blessed
To find what I need
In a world loosing hope
You're my only believe
You make things right
Everytime after time

Will you stand by me?
(Stand, stand by me)
Hold on and never let me go
Will you stand by me?
With you I know I belong
When the story gets told

[repeat chorus]

Stand by me
No more darling I want you by my side
I want you hear with me ---Lyrics submitted by QuangVinh.
