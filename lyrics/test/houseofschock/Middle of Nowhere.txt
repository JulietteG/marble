Out here in the Middle of Nowhere
Moving fast
Lovin the sun up sun down
Each and every town
Stop to catch my breath when I realize what it is

That drives this wanderlust
Inside of me
Come on come with me

Oooh driving by moonlight
No city lights as far as you can see
Oooh everything seems right
This dusty road is home to me

Arrive at dawn pull into a cafe
Well I belong right here as I'm sitting down I hear a waitress say
The coffee's hot the water's cold
It starts today
And if I choose to hang around this place
It won't be for long

Oooh driving by moonlight
No city lights as far as you can see
Oooh everything seems right
This dusty road is home to me

And if it takes just one more hour
Or if it takes another year
To find out where I'm going to be that's alright

Oooh driving by moonlight
No city lights as far as you can see
Oooh everything seems right
This dusty road is home to me

This dusty road is home to me.---Lyrics submitted by Jared Bradford.
