Saturday summers when i was a kid we'd run to the schoolyard and heres what we did, we'd pick out the captians and choose up the teams. Always a measure of my self of steam. Cuz the fastest and strongest played short stop and first the last ones they picked were the worst. i never needed to ask it was sealed. just took up my place in right field. playing...

CHORUS  : )
Right field is easy you know, you can be awkawrd and you can be slow thats why im here in right field just watchin the dandelions grow. 

playing right field can be lonely and dull. little leauges never have lefties that pull. id dream of the day they'd hit one my way. they never did; but still i would pray that id make a fantastic catcho on the run and not loose the ball in the sun. Then id awake from this long reverie and pray that the ball never came out to me

CHORUS  :  )
(whistles)

Off in the distance the game's draggin on theres strikes on the batters some runners are on i dont know the inning ive forgotten the score the whole team is yelling and i dont know what for. suddunly everyones looking at me my mind has been wandering what could it be? They point to the sky and i look up above and the baseball falls into my glove...

Here in right field its important you know you gotta know how to catch you gotta know how to throw thats why im here in right field just watching the dandelions grow---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
