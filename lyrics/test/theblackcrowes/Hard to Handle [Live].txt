Baby, here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta come home with me
I have got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get to throwin' it on you
You gotta come back for more

Boys are things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you've got another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand don't be afraid
I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
So you can place your ad with me

Boys  they come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Yeah
Hard to handle now
Oh baby

Boys  they run along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Hard
Hard to handle now
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Boys  they go along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Yeah
You're hard to handle now
Oh, yeah

Baby, a good lovin'
Baby, baby
Oh, oh, good lovin'

I gotta handle, oh, yeah
Haa, yeah---
