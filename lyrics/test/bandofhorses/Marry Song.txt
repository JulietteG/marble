Ill marry my lover. 
The place to admire, I dont, have to even ask her
I can look in her eyes and thank God that I am forgiven,
Or thank all of my friends to say I've been, truer, theyve forgotten.

And weary is my mind is to say the least its been, 
awful hard to just stand on my feet.
I think ill slow down if am able 
I wont drown in the ocean or starve in my place at the table.

Lucky ones are we all till it is over
Everyone near and far
When you smile the sun it peeks thru the clouds
Never die, for always be around and around and around.

And how is your sister, and what of your brother?
Extend hellos to your father and mother.
What in the world would cause you any sorrow?
Lighten your load, and see how I kill the wheelbarrow I barrowed

Lucky ones are we all till it is over
Everyone near and far
When you smile the sun it peeks thru the clouds
Never die, for always be around and around and around.---Lyrics submitted by Julia.
