In the lobby of the LRC
Well I knew I'd find something
A hundred stroies sittin there to read
I got my focals out I put 'em on

And all is calm, all is calm

Theres a doggie coming here to eat now
Which dated back to 1993
I don't care what the people say 'cause
That dog he don't come around here anymore

No, no the dog is gone, the dog is gone
No, no the dog is gone, the dog is gone

The town is so small
How could anybody not
Look you in the eyes
Or wave as you drive by

The world is such a wonderful place
The world is such a wonderful...

I see everyone before me, there was birthday sex and sleep
Some weren't getting along
Nobody's outside trying to murder
Nobody's outside, there's no one really at all

What the hell i saw, the hell i saw
The hell i saw, the hell i saw

The town is so small
How could anybody not
Look me in the eyes
Or wave as I drive by

The world is such a wonderful place
The world is such a wonderful place
The world is such a wonderful place
The world is such a wonderful place
La di da, La di da, La di da, La di da---Lyrics submitted by Erin.
