I was out of your league....
 and you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
  Waving affection 
You were out of my league....
 at a distance that I didn't want to see
  Down to the bottom

I wanted a junction,and often there was one
 You'd suface face first and we'd share thought bubbles
  and I still believe in the phrases that we breathed
but i know the distance isn't fair to cross

I was out of your league....
 and you twenty thousand underneath the sea
  Waving affection
You were out of my league....
 at a distance that I didn't want to see
  wanted you nearer

Your depths made a pressure that puntured my works
 and all your fluids couldn't tolerate the force of my thirst
  I love the place,where we shared our tiny grace
   But just because it's real don't mean it's gonna work

I was out of your league....
 and you twenty thousand underneath the sea
  Waving affection
You were out of my league....
 at a distance that I didn't want to see
  wanted you nearer

And true affection floats
true affection sinks like a stone
I never felt so close
I never felt so all alone

I was out of your league....
 and you were twenty thousand underneath the sea
  Waving affections
You were out of my league....
 at a distance that I didnt want to see
  want you nearer---Lyrics submitted by Brenna Proud.
