Should I do it?
Id be surrounded by so many other girls
If youre offer me to do it and I dont wanna do it.
cause if I do it I will be missing all that somethings
That Im so scared turning, keep it moving.
Yeah, thats how I do it.

cause Id be in and out of love, in and out of love, in and out of love,
Id be in and out of love.
Yeah, Im struggling for the love, but dont prick this with your love
And I just cant get enough, so at the end of night Im in and out of it.

Ive been trying to find a good thing, but its never good enough for me
You might think that Im crazy, it aint what it seems,
Im praying that maybe someday we will meet.
And youll try to find a way to my heart
Ill be trying to find a way to lead
So Id be in and out of love, in and out of love, in and out of love.
Love just cant lock me down.
Now, it just cant lock me down.

Should I do it? Take a chance, get my heart from the start
And then youll see how I do it,
Yeah, you know how I do it.
But if I do it I will be missing all that somethings
That Im so scared turning, keep it moving.
Yeah, thats how I do it.

Ive been trying to find a good thing, but its never good enough for me
You might think that Im crazy, it aint what it seems,

And youll try to find a way to my heart
Ill be trying to find a way to lead
So Id be in and out of love, in and out of love, in and out of love.
Love just cant lock me down.
Now, it just cant lock me down.

And I sort of like it, kind of sort I dont feel her
Maybe shes just a maybe, no maybes can turn to real ones.
Maybe thats just adrenaline, let me give her a second up.
You aint notice a difference, hold up.
cause how deep is your love? Actions louder than verbal,
And why youre speaking so much? And why youre sucking your teeth?
cause I cant be where you are? cause I just make you my dinner if I can meet you for life.
Whats up?

Ive been trying to find a good thing, but its never good enough for me
You might think that Im crazy, it aint what it seems,
Im praying that maybe someday we will meet.
And youll try to find a way to my heart

So Id be in and out of love, in and out of love, in and out of love.
Love just cant lock me down.
Now, it just cant lock me down. ---
