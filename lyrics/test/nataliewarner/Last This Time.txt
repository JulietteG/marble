What can you tell me bout yourself
What makes you different from everyone else
Why should I care
What do you do and where're you from
Give me something for my motivation
Take me there
Coz no matter where I go I see
The same kind of guys are always around me
It's not fair
Coz all I really want is
Someone I get along with
Is that so much to ask?

I know what I want
So there's no need to try
And make this something it's not
If we don't see eye to eye
Coz I'm a really nice girl
You're a really good guy
But are you really the one who could last this time

Do you have what I want or more
What do you have that I've never seen before
Can you make me care
Coz no matter where I go it seems
You are the only one that I can see
But will you be there
Coz I don't want to have
Just the same old song and dance
Is that so much to ask?

I know what I want
So there's no need to try
And make this something it's not
If we don't see eye to eye
Coz I'm a really nice girl
You're a really good guy
But are you really the one who could last this time
I know what I want
So there's no need to try
And make this something it's not
If we don't see eye to eye
Coz I'm a really nice girl
You're a really good guy
But are you really the one who could last this time

Give me something
To let me know it
I just want somebody who will
Give me something
To let me know 
This is the one I shouldn't let go

What can you tell me bout yourself
Will you be different from everyone else
And always be there
Coz all I really want is
Someone I get along with
Now, is that so bad?
Is that so much to ask?

I know what I want
So there's no need to try
And make this something it's not
If we don't see eye to eye
Coz I'm a really nice girl
You're a really good guy
But are you really the one who could last this time
I know what I want
So there's no need to try
And make this something it's not
If we don't see eye to eye
Coz I'm a really nice girl
You're a really good guy
But are you really the one who could last this time---Lyrics submitted by nyki.
