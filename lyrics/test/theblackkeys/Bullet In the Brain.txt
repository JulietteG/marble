Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same

Looking back on where we used to be
Everything was clear, still I refuse to see
Hearts began to burst
The diamond turned to dust
You made me talk the pain all out of me

Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same

I know I share the blame for what's in store
I was in the wrong but [?] anymore
I let you use my gifts
To back your lying wits
I'll never know just what I did it for

Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer than to remain the same---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
