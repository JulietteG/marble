I must admit
I can't explain
Any of these thoughts racing
Through my brain

It's true
Baby I'm howlin' for you

There's something wrong
With this plot
The actors here
Have not got

A clue
Baby I'm howlin' for you

Mockingbird
Can't you see
Little girl's
Got a hold on me

Like glue
Baby I'm howlin' for you

Throw the ball
To the stick
Swing and miss and a

Catcher's mitt
Strike two
Baby I'm howlin' for you ---Lyrics submitted by sergio.
