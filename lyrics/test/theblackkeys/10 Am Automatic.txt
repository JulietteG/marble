What about the night, makes you change?
Oh from sweet, to deranged?
What about my voice, tells you?
Whos been wrong, to you?

Yeah

Youve got pains
Like an addict 
Im leaving you 
Youve got pain
Like an addict 
10 A.M. automatic 

I see darkness, cover us 
And your car, kicks up dust 
What about my ways, makes you doubt
All these words, from my mouth?

Youve got pains 
Like an addict 
Im leaving you 
Youve got pains 
Like an addict 
10 A.M. automatic---Lyrics submitted by Ed.
