The Road Is Dry...Im Fucking Delirious Right Now....Life Goes On..Glorious Evening Of Knodding And Jump Starts...I Need To Make A Personal Dance Party...The Brain Works Very Wierd at this Hour...Not the Best Time For Lyric Writing I Suppose....Keep Writing Keep Dreaming.....

Nope, Can't Be Awke and dream, Drift in and out in and out

Eye Motions.. In out...Heat Lightning..Scares us Both..The Only Two People Up at this fucking hour....I won't remember this in the morning....At Least I wrote it all down...Please Pick the right song...the one that keeps the eye wide creepy yes creepy...the idea of control...Controlling death with alertness..When is the fucking sun coming up....

Then It All Changes Same Scenery but a sun involved....Shouldn't be much different...Alaska...alaska...The Brain works very wierd at this hour...Tick tock tick tock..The rain is pouring Now...Wide Awake...At Least For Now.. Nature Can Be The Death Of Me...A Thing We'll Never Overcome...In out in out....---Lyrics submitted by daniel.
