I hear the call of fall in the meadows
I hear the sounds of love through the willows
Give me your hand and we'll dance a waltz
In red, brown and yellow, all of autumn's colors.

I feel the breeze of change in my spirit
I feel a sigh of dreams to consider
Time to look back and count all we have
In those who embrace us,
friends, family, lovers.

I felt alone and lost and forgotten
You came my way to show me love's flame
Dreams may grace others
in winter, spring or summer,
but I like fall best of all.---Lyrics submitted by Teemu Mki.
