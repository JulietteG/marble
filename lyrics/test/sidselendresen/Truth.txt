Truth is a relative thing
Always adjustable
to reality
and little is
just so
Just so

Truth is my neglected child
So unembraceable
for any length of time
she's always wanting
I know
I know

Truth is to highly priced
Takes away the thrill
of illusion
my moonshine
the pretty parts
my loverhyme
Every crutch and cushion
that may soften the impact of life

and so with truth
i make my compromise---Lyrics submitted by Luiza Malta.
