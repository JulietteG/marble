The man you were waiting for, thats me
Im ready to steal your heart
If you want me, then say so, its now time
I need you in order to make that possible
Look at me roughly, my appearance is like boom
Now Im gonna hold onto you for sure
The glare Im giving out is like toxic
Everything rolls down, one by one

I know what you want, I can feel that

even if you dont say so I can see that
I could never feel it
From anyone else
To the end of this night
Get it, get it, get it, get it on
Get it, get it, get it, get it on
Get it, get it, get it, get it on
Get it, get it from me, dont stop
Get it, get it

Baby, the moment you see Your eyes come to know
I dont allow myself to others easily
If its not you I dont need any other attraction
Show me yourself, embrace me
Let me be your lover

Dont think about a thing and just feel it
Take me whos been thrown into the music
Tonight, this time where you and I become one
Dont stare at me with those eyes
Dont worry, dont even mind it
Even in these hesitant times, the end comes near
Stare at me in your perfectly normal state
Say that you want me and change your chance

I know what you want, I can feel that
even if you dont say so I can see that
I could never feel it
From anyone else
To the end of this night
Get it, get it, get it, get it on (3x)
Get it, get it from me, dont stop
Get it, get it

I keep dangerously falling for you
Faster, riskier or I will wait
Hey baby, you and me seem like just a dream
I can hear your heartbeat, louder and louder

Now its time and nobody can stop me
I cant know the depth of this night now
Little by little, we become closer
In a 1 minute 1 second gap, Ill make you mine now
If I let you know, youll get hurt I cant be responsible for it
At this rate, youll be trapped inside my heart for eternity
Im a man who knows even if you dont say so
Girl, I got you, leave everything to me

I know what you want, I can feel that
even if you dont say so I can see that
I could never feel it
From anyone else
To the end of this night
Get it, get it, get it, get it on
Get it, get it, get it, get it on
Get it, get it, get it, get it on
Get it, get it from me, dont stop
Get it, get it

Lets get it, get it, get it
Lets get it (Dont stop, get it, get it)
Lets get it, get it, get get it on
Lets get it (Dont stop, get it, get it)

Lets get it, get it, get it
Lets get it (Dont stop, get it, get it)
Lets get it, get it, get get it on
Lets get it (Dont stop, get it, get it)---
