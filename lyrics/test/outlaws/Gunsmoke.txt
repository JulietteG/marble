Some will lose their nerve tonight
Others lose their lives
A flash of fire in the fight
A cold look in my eyes
Passing judgement in the street
Where justice is revealed
I deal with darkness ruthlessly
I love the way it feels

Hear the roaring of the gun
Dead before the fear
Gunsmoke on the setting sun
You know the end is near

There's a shadow on my life
That's colder than the night
A chilling silence in the air
To fuel this dream of light
Dancing madly from the bar room
Where whiskey blinds my eyes
Lady luck is lonely now
Her streak has been denied

Hear the roaring of the gun
Dead before the fear
Gunsmoke on the setting sun
You know the end is near

I can hear the painful cry
That lets me know you're there
You're tryin' hard to stop me
When you know I just don't care
Another moment on your own
A life shot full of holes
I like how music pulls you in
To calm your restless soul

Hear the roaring of the gun
Dead before the fear
Gunsmoke on the setting sun
You know the end is near
Know the end is near ---Lyrics submitted by Laurent.
