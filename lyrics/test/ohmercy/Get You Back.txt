Well I had too much to drink,
Then I told her I didn't love her,
Now she's gone back to her sister's farm,
God damn, I truely miss her.
Now I'm begging you to come back home,
But I know it won't be easier,
Cause I don't love you but if you want me to,
I'll pretend to.
I'm waiting at your doorstep now,
Contemplating how.....
I'm gonna get you back in my life,
I want to get you back in my life.
She said damn you broken lover,
I'm staying with my sister.
There's nothing you can offer but a bed and songs of longing and that's no use to me.
I'm waiting at your doorstep now,
Just contemplating....
I'm gonna get you back in my life,
I want to get you back in my life (Repeat 2x)---Lyrics submitted by eliza.
