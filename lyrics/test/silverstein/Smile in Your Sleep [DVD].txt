When I'm lying in your bed
Play the motions through my head
You know that i'm thinking, i'm thinking
And I have reasons to believe...
That i'm not the only one
You spend this time with
But I'll stay

[chorus]
You say you're weak
You won't let me down
You won't let me down
You lie through your teeth
You smile in your sleep
You smile in your sleep

When we met you said we were the same
You know that we're different
We're different
And all the times you promised me that...
Everything would work out in the end
You were gravely mistaken

[chorus]
You say you're weak
You won't let me down
You won't let me down
You lie through your teeth
You smile in your sleep
You smile in your sleep

You lied 
You lied
You lied through your teeth
You won't let me down 
You lied I deserve better than this

I dream of steel maroon and warm your end
You gasp for air
I'll see this through this
I'll see through you
Your pale, your pale blue eyes

When your lying in your bed
Your euligies been read
You know that it's fitting
You lie

[chorus]
You say you're weak
You won't let me down
You won't let me down
You lie through your teeth
You smile in your sleep
You smile in your sleep

You smile
You smile
I deserve better than this!---Lyrics submitted by YoMomma.
