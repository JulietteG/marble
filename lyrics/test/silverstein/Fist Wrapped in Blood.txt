Come on!

Finish me off, follow the plan.
Break all the bonds, sever the ties.
And now your mission is complete,
Find and destroy me.
Torturing me, with words from your lips.
Filleting my skin, pulling my teeth.
Please forgive me for not being good enough.

Drown your sorrows in my pain
And it's something you can't explain.
When I'm choking on words you'll never say,
And you'll never feel the same.

SAME!

Bound and gagged,
I cannot move or speak these things I want to say
I couldn't describe them anyway.
So if I had it all again,
If I could start from the first words I ever said,
I would do it all the same.

Drown your sorrows in my pain
And it's something you can't explain.
When I'm choking on words you'll never say,
And you'll never feel the same.

Your joy is my pain.
My fingers are yours to cut off
And my bones are yours to shatter in pieces.
My teeth are yours to pull out
And my soul is yours to slowly rip apart.
I can't trust anyone I meet.
From now on, my chest
Feels more like a fist wrapped in blood.---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
