The drugs begin to peak.
A smile of joy arrives in me.
But sedation changes to panic and nausea.
And breath starts to shorten.
And heartbeats pound softer.

You won't try to save me!
You just want to hurt me and leave me desperate!

You taught my heart, a sense I never knew I had. 
I can forget the times that I was,
Lost and depressed from the awful truth.

How do you do it? 
You're my heroine!

You won't leave alone!
Chisel my heart out of stone!
I give in every time!

You taught my heart, a sense I never knew I had.
I can forget the times that I was,
Lost and depressed from the awful truth.

How do you do it?
You're my heroine!

I bet you laugh, at the thought of me thinking for myself. (myself)
I bet you believe, that I'm better off with you than someone else.

Your face arrives again.
A hope I had becomes surreal.
But under your covers more torture than pleasure.
And just past your lips there's more anger than laughter.

Not now or forever.
Will I ever change you.
I know that to go on. 
I'll break you, my habit!

You taught my heart, a sense I never knew I had.
I can forget the times that I was,
Lost and depressed from the awful truth.

How do you do it?
You are my heroine!

I will save myself!---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
