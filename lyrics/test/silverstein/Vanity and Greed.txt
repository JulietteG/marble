Don't say you miss me yet, I must concede
There's something I have to explain
It isn't easy playing your way
I can't even begin to say

I'm taking back my conscience
I'm gonna take control

I've seen the bravest lions shy away
I've seen the tallest tress fall down
I've made a hobby of self-deprecating
my honesty and my integrity

Don't let me drag you down

Don't say goodnight, say goodbye
(say goodbye)
You can't mend a scar
(mend a scar)
You can't fix a shattered heart
Don't even try

I'll sell you every ounce of honesty
you'll buy it all and lie with me
I can't pretend there's any truth to me
It's all just vanity and greed

I'm taking all your karma
I'm gonna need it more

Don't say goodnight, say goodbye
(say goodbye)
You can't mend a scar
(mend a scar)
You can't fix a shattered heart
Don't even try

Here's my advice if you know what's good for you
Don't let your guard down, don't let your guard down
Here's my advice if you know what's good for you
Don't let your guard down, don't let your guard down
Here's my advice if you know what's good for you
Don't let your guard down, don't let your guard down
Here's my advice if you know what's good for you
Don't let your guard down, don't let your guard down now

Don't let me drag you down

Don't say goodnight, say goodbye
(say goodbye)
You can't mend a scar
(mend a scar)
You can't fix a shattered heart
Don't even try

Don't say goodnight, say goodbye
(say goodbye)
You can't mend a scar
(mend a scar)
You can't fix a shattered heart
Don't even try

I'm taking back my conscience
I'm gonna take control
I'm taking all your karma
I'm gonna need it more---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
