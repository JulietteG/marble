You know I have to go back to the place I hate the most.
Long ago it used to help me grow,
Always kept me feeling safe from coast to coast.

Lock the gates at night and dont set my place,
I wont be back to see how the snow covers leaves.
I counted down the hours until I found a shortcut home to you,
But Im just passing through,
Barely a guest, a stranger in my own home.

I'm back in Toronto, but just til tomorrow,
That's when the bleeding stops again.
Put off all the feelings, forget all the meanings,
Just let it cycle through my head.
Were spinning again, the sinning is innocent,
Until we realize that we're back in Toronto once again.

You kicked and screamed until you met your defeat
And slammed the door behind me, where you stood for weeks.
I spent all night pretending I was alright,
I justified, I planned, but I know deep inside
I cant withstand temptation by your hand.

I'm back in Toronto, but just til tomorrow,
That's when the bleeding stops again.
Put off all the feelings, forget all the meanings,
Just let it cycle through my head.
Were spinning again, the sinning is innocent,
Until we realize that we're back in Toronto once again.

Back home, Liberty, cutting through the park
I see everything has changed except for me.
This place is called home but Ive never been so scared
To face the cold, breathe in the truth from the air.
This place is called home, but from Kensington to Dees,
Everything I pass it plants a seed.
And it takes me back to a time when all I had
Was a cloud over my head, weights on my feet.
This place is called home but its not where I will stay,
Its all temporary, I know Ill never move away,
But I know this city will always feel strange,
This city is a stranger to me.---
