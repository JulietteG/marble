Never again 
I'll slit my throat
With the knife I pulled
Out of my spine
Maybe when you find
Out that i'm dead
You'll realize what you did to me

[chorus]
And if my lungs still let me breathe...
Would you be there for me
If I can make myself believe
I'll give you back what you took away

No I won't let it go
Douse myself in gasoline
So don't...
Save me when you come in to the fire
I'd rather die than have to see...
Your Smile

[chorus]
And If my lungs still let me breathe...
Would you be there for me
If I can make myself believe 
I'll give you back what you took away

You made me swear, You made me swear
I, I can't sleep 
Realize all these things that you...
Took from me

Smash my heart, You made me swear
Into dust, You made me swear
Suffocate my mind, You made me swear
Tear at me from inside, You made me swear

Smash apart what you created
How can I ever stop you from...
Crushing my soul
It was, It was yours, yours...
To begin with

[chorus]
And if my lungs still let me breathe...
Would you be there for me
If I can make myself believe
I give you back what you took away---Lyrics submitted by Zachary.
