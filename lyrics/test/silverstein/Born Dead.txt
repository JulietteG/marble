You call this a privilege
No, I call it a right
There's no respect for life
No compromising
Coverage denied (Coverage denied)

So sit behind your desk and tell me how I'm supposed to feel inside
You know I'm slowly dying, how long I have left is for you to decide

We keep on suffering everyday
We're victims of opportunity
One nation under God, they said
We are all born dead

Dead and rotting bodies fill the
Fields in the east
There's no respect for life, it never stops
Is this what makes us free?

So flex your muscle as you barricade the whole world piece by piece
How long until the ocean overflows into our yards and streets?

We keep on suffering everyday
We're victims of opportunity
One nation under God, they said
We are all pawns, we are all sheep, we are all born dead

We can't escape this
Until we unify as one
I'll fight the sickness
Until my time has come

We keep on suffering everyday
We're victims of opportunity
One nation under God, they said
We are all born dead

We keep on suffering everyday
We're victims of opportunity
One nation under God, they said
We are all pawns, we are all sheep, we are all born dead---Lyrics submitted by David.
