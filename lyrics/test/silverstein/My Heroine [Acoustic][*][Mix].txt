The drugs began to peak
A smile of joy arrives in me,
But sedation changes, 
To panic and nausea.
And breath starts to shorten,
And heartbeats pound softer.

You wont,
Try to save me.
You just,
Want to, 
Hurt me.
And leave me desperate.

You taught my heart
A sense I never knew I had
I can't forget
The times that I was 
Lost and depressed from the awful truth
How do you do it
You're my heroine.

You won't leave me alone
Chisel my heart out of stone
I give in everytime.

You taught my heart
A sense I never knew I had
I can't forget
The times that I was 
Lost and depressed from the awful truth
How do you do it
You're my heroine

I bet you'd laugh
At the thought of me 
Thinking for myself (myself)
I bet you believe (bet you believe)
That I'm better off with you than someone else

Your face arrives again
All hope I had becomes surreal
But under your cover's
More torture than pleasure
And just past your lips
There's more anger than laughter
Not now or forever will I ever change you
I know that to go on I'll break you, 
My habit

You taught my heart
A sense I never knew I had
I can't forget
The times that I was 
Lost and depressed from the awful truth
How do you do it
You're my heroine

I will save myself.---Lyrics submitted by Lisa.
