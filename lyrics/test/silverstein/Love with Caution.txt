The river's running fast right now.
It's the time of year the water cleanses itself.
Running wild, but always in control.
And now's the time to sever the ties.
To habits that weaken, disguised by tradition.

Drain away this fear,
Until it disappears.
Yeah!

I'm not ready to swim, I'm not going to sink.
I just want to float through the sea.
Are you pulling me down?
Are you holding me up?
Or are you slowly drowning me?

There's something to be said for luck.
It's better than being good.
When half of being good is being lucky, anyways.
We're spreading out, we're harder to hit.
Become a moving target,
Drop your burden,
And abandon it.

Drain away this fear,
Until it disappears.
Yeah!

I'm not ready to swim, I'm not going to sink.
I just want to float through the sea.
Are you pulling me down?
Are you holding me up?
Or are you slowly drowning me?
you slowly drowning me

I remember a day when I could walk right down the street
And feel so confident, and know everything's okay.
Take my hand, don't let go, but please remember, hearts can grow.
We still have to take it slow.
I love with caution and trust, alone.

I'm not ready to swim, I'm not going to sink.
I just want to float through the sea.
Are you pulling me down?
Are you holding me up?
Or are you slowly drowning me?

I'm not ready to swim, I'm not going to sink.
I just want to float through the sea.
Are you pulling me down?
Are you holding me up?
Or are you slowly drowning me?
you slowly drowning me---Lyrics submitted by Nina.
