i wake up in the afternoon,
empty walls make up the room,
and i'm wishing for one thing,
to give myself the strength,
to keep myself alive,
long enough to make sure you don't try,
to turn out anything like me,
another fraud,another fake,
don't pretend you're not the one who's wrong,

[CHORUS]
you're keeping me sane,
when i'm feeling alone,
i wield my heart and my flesh and bones,
don't leave me to die by myself,
i can't live without you,

the sunlight's creeping through the blinds,
there's only so many more days,
untill you're cast away,
from ever seeing me,
they won't understand,
they'll never see the way you medicate my head,
without you here i'm left for dead,
don't pretend you're not the one who's wrong,

[REPEAT CHORUS]
without you here

you're all i have in a world that judges long before it sees,
you're all i have in places that hate me,
and only want to push me down,
now i'm forsaken,
past the point,i'll bend,you'll break me,
i won't be fine,you're all mistaken,
don't pretend you're not the one who's wrong,

don't you pretend,it's gonna be okay,
don't lie and say it'sbetter off this way,
don't you pretend,don't you pretend,
don't you pretend you're not the one who's wrong,
don't lie and say,
you're not the one who's wrong,
don't pretend

[REPEAT CHORUS]
don't you pretend,don't you pretend
without you here,don't lie and say
you're not the one who's wrong,

you're keeping me sane,when i'm feeling alone,
i won't live,
you're not the one who's wrong,
don't leave me to die when i'm feeling alone,
i can't live without you,
don't pretend you're not the one who's wrong...---Lyrics submitted by are_jeam.
