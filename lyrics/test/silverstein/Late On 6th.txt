I hope you understand that I tried hard
It slipped through my hands
I know we can't go back
I made mistakes, I lost track

When I called your name, you didn't hear a sound
I couldn't feel it then, but I need you now
I didn't see the rain when it came down
You didn't feel it then, I wish you'd feel it now

You struck a match and I burned so bright
When it got dark we lit up the night
It's late on 6th and I'm on fire
I can't put it out, I'm too tired

When I called your name, you didn't hear a sound
I couldn't feel it then, but I need you now
I didn't see the rain when it came down
You didn't feel it then, I wish you'd feel it now

I stopped when I reached the edge
And I yelled as loud as I can
"Don't go, don't go"
I stopped when I reached the edge
And I yelled it over again
"Don't go, don't go"
I stopped when I reached the edge
And I yelled as loud as I can
"Don't go, don't go"---
