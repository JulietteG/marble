I am alive in everything I touch.
I still survive in all the ones Ive loved.
Nothing dies, it lives in what weve done.
I am alive in everything Ive ever touched.

A forest fire burns, Im headed right for it.
This California spark, it takes no prisoners.
We go from light to dark,
Were both asleep at the switch.
Pendleton goes on and on,
And I dont think I can make it.

Another milestone,
Another day is gone.
We refuse communication and just write off what weve lost.
Now Im dead youve put me in the ground.
Dont deny your implication.
You decide the ones who breathe the ones who drown.

I am alive in everything I touch.
Were all alive in everything weve ever touched.

A picturesque night scene, but somethings just not right.
Hollywood kills truth, and preys on honesty.
These snakes dont hide.
Images dont lie.
All these cheaters have no shame,
Theyll leave you there to die.

Another milestone,
Another day is gone.
We refuse communication and just write off what weve lost.
Now Im dead youve put me in the ground.
Dont deny your implication.
You decide the ones who breathe the ones who drown.

Im by your side.
Its not your pain I judge.
Im, I'm always by your side I sympathize but stand by what Ive done.

So if you're listening to this.
You're listening to me.
I'm speaking right now.
And I'm speaking forever.
My memory lives on through you.
And through everyone who's ever known you.

I am alive! [x4]
(It's not about blood and guts.)
(And guilt and pain.)
(It's about this love we feel.)
(Which is all that matters.)
(It never dies.)
(It will last forever.)

Another milestone,
Another day is gone.
We refuse communication and just write off what weve lost.
Now Im dead youve put me in the ground.
Dont deny your implication.
You decide the ones who breathe the ones who drown.

I'm by your side!
Im by your side but stand by what Ive done.---
