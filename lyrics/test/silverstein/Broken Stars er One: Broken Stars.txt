Shooting daggers at me
Letting it be known you're not impressed
I never fail at failing all your tests
Don't be so proud,
'Cause you're still so scared to be alone
You can't change your mind

You won't embrace this
But you'll accept this
You can't let go

Broken stars,
By a single shattered mirror
Seven years of trust
I know you'll never change for anyone
A cold heart never lusts

My mind's made up
And I would know I'd do the right thing
Get up and stand tall!
My mind's made up
Why I'm scared I won't be able
To get up when I fall

We cast a single shadow for so long now
It's so hard to see the sun at all (the sun at all)
But you need light to see
the writing on the wall

My mind's made up
And I would know I'd do the right thing
Get up and stand tall!
My mind's made up
Why I'm scared I won't be able
To get up when I fall...

...into the hole I've made
I'll place myself alone
I'll find the strength within myself
To climb out on my own, own!

My mind's made up (made up)
And I'll know I'd do the right thing
Get up and stand tall!
My mind's made up (made up)
Why I'm scared I won't be able
To get up when I fall

Yeah!

These broken stars
Can't be put back in the sky
I can still feel the scars
I won't let them die
We won't fade away!
And now,
We will set this all ablaze---Lyrics submitted by Tanner.
