Im lying down
And you cant see
Why Ive gone to sleep

Try to relate
Can't give in to your temptations (temptations)

All your hopes and dreams, washing away silently
Forget everything
you've taught me (you've taught me)
When I looked up to you

Fall to your knees
And Give up your aspirations (aspirations)
Falling to your knees

So how can you expect
me to just close my eyes
And forget your mistakes
Defending you is getting
harder everyday, day

I'm breaking down
The endings near
The final call to make it through
Youll choose

Try to relate
forget everything you've taught me 
(you've taught me)
When I looked up to you

So how can you expect
me to just close my eyes
And forget your mistakes
Defending you is getting
hard everyday, day

I look inside myself for strength
Like a million times before
You'll never let it in because
I know you said
I know you said
I know, I know, I know, I know

Fall, how can you let it go? (let it go)
How can you be this way
I'll never forget (Never forget)
Where I come from, Where I've been
I'll never become you

So how can you expect
me to just close my eyes
And forget your mistakes
Defending you is getting
harder everyday, day

So how can you expect (I look inside myself for strength)
me to just close my eyes (Like a million times before)
And forget your mistakes (You'll never let it in)
Defending you is getting (Can you look inside yourself?
harder everyday, day (Is it hurting you at all? You'll never let it in)

You'll never let it in
You've lost it all---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
