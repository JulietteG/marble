All together were taking pictures.
These eyes, this smile,
A look put on a thousand times.
This town of lies,
It only makes sense were both here.
A perfect match (a perfect match),
A symbiotic relationship.
No lines in this sand,
I want to stay here until the end.

Then you said, living heres a death sentence.
In my head, I wished you only knew
What you had.

Ill take advantage of the situation, as long as I can.
Wont rely on aspirations to bring out the best of me.
(The best of me.)
Have another of our conversations, no ones listening.
We confine our confrontation by just burying the rest of it at sea.

This place, 4 walls,
No paintings hung, no love at all.
No space, no soul,
No one could ever call it home.
So bring me back (just bring me back),
Where southern pride takes over grace.
Black lungs, white beach,
Emerald coast will set me free.

When I said, I dont want to leave again.
In your head, you wished that it was true
And I was home.

Ill take advantage of the situation, as long as I can.
Wont rely on aspirations to bring out the best of me.
(The best of me.)
Have another of our conversations, no ones listening.
We confine our confrontation by just burying the rest of it at sea.
(The rest of it at sea.)

The darkest beach Ive seen.
I cant remember what you look like.
All I know is distraction.
All I feel is the breeze.
This is all I need.

Then you said, living heres a death sentence.
In my head, I wished you only knew (wished you only knew)
What you had.

Ill take advantage of the situation, as long as I can.
Wont rely on aspirations to bring out the best of me.
(The best of me.)
Have another of our conversations, no ones listening.
We confine our confrontation by just burying the rest of it at sea.
