I'm the setting sun behind the trees, the saddest one you've seen.
I've been burning holes and breaking dreams, and I regret it.
I'm fixing things I've broken, it's not as easy as it used to be.
I'm throwing temper tantrums, I used to settle,
but now I make a scene you can't believe.

I said I'd never walk away, but I'm not able to stay.
I said I'd never leave this place, but I can't stay here,
to watch you fade, and watch you change into someone I can't face.
Now I can't replace I can't replace you.

You're the swirling wind above the sea,
the maddest storm they've seen.
Now you're breaking waves and smashing dreams, and you can't help it.
You're drowning streets and stranding,
a million people, you're starting out with me.
You're crashing down from anger, you've stopped and settled,
and now you're sound asleep, and so serene.

I said I'd never walk away, but I'm not able to stay.
I said I'd never leave this place, but I can't stay here,
to watch you fade, and watch you change into someone I can't face.
Now I can't replace I can't replace you.

And when the sun is down,
and when the skies are calm you'll see, calm we'll be.
We'll wait for the cycle, we'll repeat our same mistakes,
the same mistakes we've always made.---Lyrics submitted by Shelby.
