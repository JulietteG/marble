I know, what I want,
And I'll get, what I need,
I'll come over and I'll show you how,
Don't you wish that you could have me now.

You say that you want,
All of my love but let's be honest,
We don't need all that,
I like it better with no strings attached.

Good girls do bad things sometimes,
But we get by with it,
Good girls do bad things sometimes,
But we get by with it.

How much more can we take,
If I give you a taste,
I've been waiting for you all night long,
I come around and then I'm gone.

You get yours, I'll get mine,
Then we run out of time,
You're the only one that I desire,
'Cause I love to play with fire.

Good girls do bad things sometimes,
But we get by with it,
Good girls do bad things sometimes,
But we get by with it.

When I'm down, I'll let you know,
When I'm done, I'll let you go.

Good girls do bad things sometimes,
But we get by with it,
Good girls do bad things sometimes,
But we get by with it.---
