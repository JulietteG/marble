When I first met you I knew you were the one
'Til you took me home and I met her
She had your boxers on
She was listening to your song
And I thought right then that you had everything

But I knew she was jealous from the start
Yeah
I knew she was jealous from the start

'Cause I know better not to be friends with boys with girlfriends
Oh
I know better than that
I know better
You play the victim and I'll be the bad guy
I know better than that
I know better

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh

We started hanging around after 9
I could've sworn that I was yours
You looked at me and said, "It's a little too late for bed"
We went to the hotel and talked about everything

But I knew she was jealous from the start
Yeah
I knew she was jealous from the start

(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
'Cause I know better not to be friends with boys with girlfriends
Oh
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)
I know better than that
I know better
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
You play the victim and I'll be the bad guy
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)
I know better than that
I know better

(Ah)
'Cause what she did to us was tragic
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

(Ah)
And I have to do what's right
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

(Ah)
What we had was really magic
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

(Ah)
But I have to get what's mine

Oh
What's mine
I'll get what's mine and you'll get yours

'Cause I know better not to be friends with boys with girlfriends
Oh
I know better than that
I know better
You play the victim and I'll be the bad guy
I know better than that
I know better

(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
I know better not to be friends with boys with girlfriends
Oh
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)
I know better than that
I know better
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
You play the victim and I'll be the bad guy
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)
I know better than that
I know better that that

I know better not to be friends with boys with girlfriends
Oh
I know better than that
I know better---Lyrics submitted by paulina.
