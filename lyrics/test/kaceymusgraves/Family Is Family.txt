They're there for your first year, they give you your first beer
When you get your heart broke, they're there for your worst year
Don't get you at all, but your apple don't fall too far from 'em
They own too much wicker and drink too much liquor
You'd wash your hands of them, but blood's always thicker
You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em

Family is family, in church or in prison
You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

They're there when you're married, divorced, and remarried
You fall out of touch, but then someone gets buried
And you're right back together like no time has ever gone by
Can't live with or without 'em; you might talk about 'em
But if someone else does, well, then you'll knock 'em out cause
When it's all said and done, they're the only ones that you got

Yeah, family is funny, they'll ask you for money
Even though they know you ain't got no money
They show up at Christmas, get up in your business
They might not be fancy, but family is family

You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em---
