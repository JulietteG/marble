You started it, 
You wanted it, 
You got it and then,
You go and pretend that you didn't

Come play something,
Over gonsu
Checks into your heart, 
And begs like a dog till you kick it, 

Till you do, till you do, 
Well might as well give it another day, 
Give it another day

I care with you, 
I bare with you, 
With your lonely love, 
It wasn't enough for you was it,

I'll wait for you, 
I'll stay for you, 
I'll play like a friend, 
Until you begin to recover 

Till you do, till you do, 
Well might as well give it another day, 
Give it another day

I can tell, 
You're doing well, 
It's not so easy to believe in someone else

Till you do, till you do, 
Well might as well give it another day, 
Give it another day
Give it another day

ooh hoo, ooh hoo, ooh hoo, ooh hoo,
I can tell, 
You're doing well, 
It's not so easy to believe in someone else---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
