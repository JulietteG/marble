I've been silent, instead of speaking up
Gave my advise, instead of giving love
I have been unfair, faithless and unkind
I have shut my eyes, just so I would stay blind
It's not what I meant to do
'Causei wanna honor you

Make me over
Make me new
Make me a a mirror
A reflection of you
Take me all apart
Take me to Your heart
Ad pull me closer
Oh, Jesus
Make me over

Take away the pride that whispers in the dark
Oh, take the stone out of the middle of my heart
Hidden underneath my insecurities
Is the servant that You've destined me to be
Day after precious day
I get it my own way

So make me over
Make me new
Make me a mirror
A reflection of you
Take me all apart
Take me to Your heart
And pull me closer
Sweet Savior
Make me over

I am only made of you imagining
I'm dust and clay on the wind
Wash me in the river of your sacrifice
Until I'm changed
Purified
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

Take me all apart
Take me to your heart
And pull me closer
My Jesus
Make me over
Yeah
Make me over
Yeah, yeah
Make me over
Oh, make me over, Jesus

Please
Make me over
I need you
I need you, Jesus
Make me new
Oh---Lyrics submitted by Rose.
