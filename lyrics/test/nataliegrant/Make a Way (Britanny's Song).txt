she was only 17,
wild at heart and following her dreams,
believing she was pretty,
got a ticket to the city,
where she'd find her place on the cover of a magazine,
it was only a chat room,
but it would lead the way,
to the door of a man where she'd throw it all away,
he said they'd take it slow,
but little did she know,
she'd be all used up by the end of the day,
but she was strong,
and she would survive,
ambition would be her drive, and she said,
"I'll make the way
I'll do whatever it takes
even thoughit wont be easy
I have a plan and though
I may not understand
someday, I'll make a way,"
where did she go wrong,
how did she get there?,
livin' hard and looking older than her years,
Miss Little Big Town,
trying to hold a job down,
doing what she could to choke her tears,
but she was strong,
and she would survive,
a spark of hope had kept her dreams alive,
I'll make a way,
I'll do whatever it takes,
even though it wont be easy,
I have a plan and though I may not understand,
someday I'll make a way,
walking down the road,
in the city where she'd come with so much hope,
see, her vision had long died,
along with all her pride,
and she found herself at the end of her rope,
but she heard angels through the door,
of a church she'd passed a millions times before,
inside the chior song was ringing,
soon she found herself believing,
that out there maybe there was something more,
so she bowed her head to pray,
and she cried, Jesus, please make a way,
and she heard him say,
I'll make a way,
I'll do whatever it takes,
even though it wont be easy,
I have a plan and though you may not understand,
today, I'll make a way,
hear him say, today he'll make a way,
Hallalujah, Hallalujah, Hallalujah,
today he'll make a way,
for you, he's gonna make a way,
for you, he'll gonna make a way.---Lyrics submitted by Jenna.
