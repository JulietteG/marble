Lost are saved 
Find their way 
At the sound of Your great name 
All condemned; feel no shame,  
At the sound of Your great name 
Every fear; has no place 
At the sound of Your great name 
The enemy; he has to leave;  
At the sound of Your great name 

Jesus, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain for us 
Son of God and Man 
You are high and lifted up;  
That all the world will praise Your great name 

All the weak, find their strength 
At the sound of Your great name 
Hungry souls receive grace 
At the sound of Your great name 
The fatherless, they find their rest 
At the sound of Your great name 
Sick are healed, and the dead are raised 
At the sound of Your great name 

Jesus, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain for us 
Son of God and Man 
You are high and lifted up;  
That all the world will praise Your great name 

Redeemer, My Healer, Lord Almighty 
My Savior, Defender,  
You are my King 

Redeemer, My Healer, Lord Almighty 
My Savior, Defender,  
You are my King 

Jesus, the name of Jesus 
You are high and lifted up 
And all the world will praise Your great name 

Jesus, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain for us 
Son of God and Man 
You are high and lifted up;  
That all the world will praise Your great name---
