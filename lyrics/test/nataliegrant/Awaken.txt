sometimes it feels like i'm just exsiting 
i'm noot really living 
i'm only whacthing the time slip away iv'e
forgotten who i am in you
i'm not who i'm meant to be 
i'm drifting farther away from my destiny

CH
awaken my heart 
awaken my soul
awaken your power to take control
awaken the passion to live for you lord
awaken me


my soul is longing my heart is searching 
i'm desperate for u to move 
give me a hunger pull me close
i'm crying out to u 

CH
awaken my heart awaken my soul 
awaken the power to take control 
awaken the passion to live for you
i wanna live for you

CH

open my eyes so i can see your presence
dwelling inside of me
wake me up 'cause i can't live anither minute
if i'm not shining your light

awaken my heart waken my soul 
awaken thw passion in MEEEE

lord awaken me to live my destiny
lord awaken me to shine your light through me 2X

ch

wake me up lord give passion
JESUS. i wanna live for you...---Lyrics submitted by Elisa.
