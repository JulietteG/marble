Shadows all around you as you, surface from the dark.
Emerging from the gentle grip, of night's unfolding arms.
Darkness, darkness all everywhere, do you feel alone?
Subtle grace of gravity, the heavy weight of stone.

You don't see what you possess, a beauty calm and clear.
It floods the sky and blurs the darkness, like a chandelier.
All the light that you possess is skewed  by lakes and seas.
Shattered surface, so imperfect, it's all that you believe.

I will bring a mirror, so silver so exact.
So precise and so pristine, a perfect pane of glass. 
I will set the mirror, to face the blackened sky.
You'll see your beauty every moment that you rise.---Lyrics submitted by Kris Kagamine.
