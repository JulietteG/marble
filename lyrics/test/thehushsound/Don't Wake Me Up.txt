You came to me
In seamless sleep
and slipped right in
Behind my eye
On the back of my mind
We swam a sea
Of pretty sights and chandelier skies
I swore I could feel you breathe
It was all so real to me

The light had slipped through the window
The morning ripped you away oh

Don't wake me up
I am still dreaming
The story's undone
Unraveled at the seams
Don't wake me up
Death is misleading
And when I fall asleep
I Sleep with a ghost

I moved in the dark
The room calm and cold
A quiet hollow
I am such a haunted soul
Your ghost is gone
the bed is so cold

The light had slipped through the window
The morning ripped you away oh

Don't wake me up
I am still dreaming
The story's undone
Unraveled at the seams
Don't wake me up
Death is misleading
And when I fall asleep
I sleep with a ghost

Oh you were a fire caught in a storm
Memories like embers keep us warm
You will leave me in the morning
leave me

The light had slipped through the window
The morning ripped you away oh.---Lyrics submitted by Beez Smith.
