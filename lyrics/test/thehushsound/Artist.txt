I know that You're an Artist,You're the hardest one to deal with
Everythin that you conceal is revealed on your canvas

You find all of your ugly meanings
In the thing I find beatiful
Do you see the fall is coming?
Come, Im Falling into you

You perceive all of these things I'd never have known
Love,will you turn off the light?
Cause we're already home

You Painted me in Pastel
Colors that dont tell of any boldness
Cause thats the way you love to see me:
So delicate,so weak,so little purpose

But your eyes are drawn of charcoal
They are black,They're so cold,They're so imperfect
Because they see a sleeping world
Where walking isn't worth it

You perceive all of these things I'd never had known
Love,will you turn off the light?
Cause we're already home

How,how,can you live without your lies?
Oh,oh,Love,I've had enough f you tonight

All of these things I'd never have known
Love,will you turn off the light?
Cause we're already home

You perceive all of these things I'd never have known
Love,will you turn off the light?
Cause we're already home---Lyrics submitted by Sebastian.
