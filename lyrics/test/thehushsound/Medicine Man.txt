Medicine man, dance me across the country.
Medicine man, dance me across the sky.
Medicine man, now my feet are trecking.
Medicine man, can you hear my cry?

I don't want to be the one, the one, the one,
That you forget. 
I don't, I don't, I don't just want to be your regret.
(oooh, ooooh, oooh, ooooh)

Medicine man, lay my hands in your hands.
Medicine man, you will clear my mind.
Medicine man, can you heal my body?
Medicine man, can you my cry?

I don't want to be, the one, the one, the one
That you forget.
I don't, I don't, I don't just want to be your regret.
(oooh, ooooh, oooh, oooh)

I don't know where to begin.
I don't know how to break the battle i'm living in
Do anything to take away the memory of him
Can't you see that I have now way out.
Don't leave me now.

Medicine man, clear my mind.
Medicine man, ooooh.
Medicine man, hear my cry.
Medicine man, oooh.
(x2)

Medicine man. x2

Medicine man, oooooh.---Lyrics submitted by Gege.
