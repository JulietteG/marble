Shackles and chains get in the way
And I'm locked in the gardener's gate
Where everything grows and no one should go where I've gone
I won't come back

How can you dream in the doorway
Without ever going in?
How can you dream in the doorway
Without making excuses and drawing conclusions
You're at it again

[Chorus]
I am not your concern
The world will still turn 
When I'm not around

Rely on me and you'll fall
Backed up to the wall
Someone let me out

It's all sinkin' in
I'd probly just swim if I could
But I can't, so I'm just hanging on and on
Just let me go
You know, it won't be long before the lights are out

Dream in the doorway without ever going in
How can you dream in the doorway
Without making excuses and drawing conclusions
You're at it again

[Chorus]

With no intention of consoling you
I was controlling you
I'm letting go of you

With no intention of consoling you
I was controlling you
I'm letting go of you

[Chorus] x2

I...
I...
I am not your concern
The world will still turn 
When I'm not around---Lyrics submitted by Christin.
