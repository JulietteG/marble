You are the lighthouse, the seamark
The tempests created this tide
I'm pulled to the black silver ocean
where the current and the heavens collide

You are the brick
I am so unpredictable
led by the current away
Your solid stage is so necessary to save
all those who stray

You are the navigator who never could lead
we were lost in the silver sea
I was the ship who was too proud to ever sink.

I am your thought but the water is amnesia
my name is on the tip of your tongue
My image is slipping
but your memory is gripping it
this is my breath in your lungs

You are the navigator who never could lead
we were lost in the silver sea
I was the ship who was too proud to ever sink.

Echo, my voice is an echo
of places I don't know
and stories I've been told

Echo. We all are connected
a lighthouse a voyage
for history's sake,
will you please take notice?---Lyrics submitted by Kaleena.
