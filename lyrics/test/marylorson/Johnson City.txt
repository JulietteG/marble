how can you look at me that way? you used to be innocent too
picking for me the inedible fruits
and bringing them back home on the tube
ohhh
come on baby the time has come
to make that johnson city run
i'll drive there and you'll drive home
so lucky that we're not alone

walking slow like its her birthday
like something was fixed from the start
made us do odd things that nature cant buy
made us to see in the dark
ohhh

come on baby the time has come
to make that johnson city run
i'll drive there and you'll drive home
so lucky that we're not alone

what you want to be, to be
you are, you are, you are

instrumental

i'll never do something that stupid again
i'll never go back there alone
but aren't i allowed to revisit the place
you said we'll never comealone
ohhh
come on baby the time has come
to make that johnson city run
i'll drive there and you'll drive home
so lucky we're not alone

what you want to be, to be
what you want to be, to be
what you want to be, to be
you are, you are, you are---Lyrics submitted by Melz Durston.
