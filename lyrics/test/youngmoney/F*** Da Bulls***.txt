Yeah 
Cut it up gimme a light 
Yeah and by the way nigga 
Its Young Mula, first lady 

[Nicki Minaj] 
Uhhh yo yo 
Let us begin with the bad lil' specimen 
Ballenciago's is all these things I be steppin' in 
Gucci bathing suits, only thing I'm dressin' in 
Cause I get wetter than a navy seal veteran 
Got them writing love letters in they journal 
Keep em on these toes like a midget at the urinal 
B-b-b-bad as I wanna be 
She ain't bad she a sad and a wannabe 

[Birdman] 
Yeah fuck the bullshit 
It's big money poppin' 
Young Mula! 
Yeah 
Just like that 
What up young nigga 
Lets go Gudda 

[Gudda Gudda] 
Okay we runnin' this shit, when we walk in the building 
Got bitches from wall to wall, hoes hangin' from the ceiling 
Young Money we 'bout to kill 'em, I promise I'll make a million 
And if they didn't have no hands, I'll bet them bitches go feel 'em 
I'm talkin' money and power, you gettin' money? I doubt it 
Fresher than baby power, with your bitch in the shower 

That pussy imma devour, I beat it up till it's sour 
No need for you to even trip bitch I'll be done in a hour 
Let's go!

[Lil Wayne] 
They say the blacker the berry, the redder the cherry 
I say sweeter it is, ya dig..berry 
Then the bullshit varies, and it got me weary 
But I know two of the same, call it murdered and married 
Hustling is so necessary, with no avisaries 
But aint no love, like a calendar with no February's 
Imma need four secretary, and four Bloody Mary's 
Imma go eat me some pussy, and choke up the cherry 
I'm gone 

[Birdman] 
Yeah 
Fully loaded with it, to the ceiling with it 
More money than you ever seen nigga 
Aiight, Drizzy, Drake 

[Drake] 
Look 
Kill the game no one recovers the murder weapon 
Young angel if ya hate me tell me burn in heaven 
How'd you sleep on me, the highest earning freshmen 
Like ya 3rd infection, I hope ya learned ya lesson 
Yeah 
I spit raw but I prefer protection 
I own her heart and her mind, and the shirt she slept in 
Bitch I got the answer,and still ain't heard the question 
I shut ya club down, please reserve my section 
Fuck a confrontation, they aint no cakin' it 
And I'm cakin' bitch, so tell me why I take a break from it 
The mother of your child always tell you I'm her favorite 
She call me her baby, not the one she was in labor with 
She say 'oh you taste good', I say 'oh just savor it' 
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit 
Cause I get paid to stand, and I get paid to sit 
So I don't walk around with money, baby girl I'm made of it---Lyrics submitted by sonny.
