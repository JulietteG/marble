Lil Wayne

Yeah, uhhuh
David Banner on the beat bitch
Hahaha
Young Money, Streets

I'ma east sider rider, whoa kemosabe
Bitches get to stepping like Cole, Gina, Tommy
Pussy is a weapon and my hoes think I'm Simon
And simon say go and get my mother fucking money
Young Mulah bitch, tell them hoes, take their clothes off
And I don't hunt birds, but I'll shoot you in your mohawk
Yeah, flow nasty like coleslaw
Call me mister no flaw

- Gudda Gudda

Yeah, I sip drank and pop pills tilI I dose off
Wake up, grab the mic then I goes off
Too G for office, boss of all bosses
Crucify rappers, nail niggas to the crosses
I'm fresh out the slaughterhouse, blood on my apron
We Louisanimals, watch me let the gators in
I'm going on my paper run, a week at the Days Inn
Icing on my fingertips, I be getting cake in

- T-Streets (Chorus)

I be getting cake then
Watching for the rats and trying not to get snake bit
It's that pointing at your face shit
And if you scared, you better go and see Mase bitch
David Banner on the beat hoe
And I beat the beat up like Dee Bo
I got the game on TiVo
So I guess you can say The Streets Is Watching

- Jae Millz

I don't promise much but I promise you that it'll flow boy
Name Jae, but you can call me Millzbury Doughboy
Silence on the nine but, the chopper make more noise
And if the bitch scream, I'ma pop her, no noise
Bank account type solid, Truck nice and brolic
The rims sticking out like the shoulders on Dwight Howard
You niggas ain't G's, you gents and quite coward
But I'll put you higher than flight pilots

- Gudda Gudda

I am petrifying, the metal turn to lightning
Burn through your clothes like an iron
I am no american idol, no Simon Cowell
Wack niggas throw in the towel
I'm getting money with the rap, pay me by the vowel
I'm hungry like a pack of wolves so I just howl
Holla, Cash rules everything around me
So I'ma get the money, dolla dolla bills in them hundreds

(Chorus)

- Nicki Minaj

Uh, yo, yo, yo
I'ma bad what? bout to get a mani ,ped
I'm the big bad wolf and your granny dead
Even though I'm in mexico
I rep New York like Plaxico
Look, switch my name, now I'm celebrating Hannukah
Lewinsky bitches, young money Monica
I been hot since hedgehog, Sonic the
So could you pass me the keys to the Tonica
I mean Tonka, That's the truck bitches
Fxck you and fxck all of you fxck bitches
Matter of fact, put some sprinkles on my cupcakes
And get ready to put your dimples in this duct tape

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Jayla.
