[Lil Wayne:]
Man fuck these niggas
I'm a spare everything but these niggas
I flip the gun and gun Buck these niggas
Take the knife off this AK and cut these niggas
Yeah and fuck these bitches
I swear I care bout everything but these bitches
I don't care I "so what" these bitches
And I put young mula baby way above these bitches
If it ain't broke don't break it
And if he ain't shook I'm gon' shake him
Hope I don't look weak 'cause when a wolf cry wolf you still see that wolfs teeth muthafuckaaaa
Futuristic handgun if you act foul you get two shots and one
I'm at your face like mancum
You niggas softer then roseanne's son
You cannot reach me on my Samsung
I'm busy fuckin' the world and givin' the universe my damn tongue
Crazy muthafucka I am one but the crazy thing is I began one
All white bricks I'm straight like it's jumpin' back to 36 nigga
Big house long hall ways got 10 bathrooms I can shit all day nigga

[Chorus:]
And we don't want no problems, OK your a goon what's a goon to a goblin
Yeah big kane on the beat, I fuck around and leave a nigga brains on the street(ooohhh)
Now pop that pussy I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh huh and we be steady mobbin' oh Kimosabe big ballin' is my hobby

[Gucci Mane:]
What the fuck is up
It's Gucci Mane the G
It's Titty boy no pity boy
Big scarcity the city boy
So Icy so no Nike boy
Just Gucci Louis Prada 'scuse me
Gucci Mane keep shittin' on me
Why that boy keep buyin' jewelry
East Atlanta cockin' hammers
Bandanas on car antennas
No, we do not talk to strangers
Just cut off these niggas fingaz
Gucci's armed and dangerous
Cocaine, Codeine, and Angel Dust
This AK 47'll hitchu everywhere from ankle up
Clip the size of Nia Long
Clips long as a Pringles can
.45 desert eagle on me you'll think I'm an eagles fan
Tony Braxton sniper rifle
Make you neva breathe again
Fuck that nigga
Kill that nigga
Bring him back
Kill him again
Gucciii

[Lil Wayne:]
Yeah the money is the motive
Fuck with the money it get ugly as coyote
OK, I'm reloadin' better pull it if you tote it
I buy a pound break it down and put it in a stogie
Swagga so bright I don't even need light
I'm with a model broad she don't even eat rice
But would you believe that she dykes
And she asked for a pitcher so I gave her three strikes
I'm the man around this muthafucka
I'm so hot you probably catch a tan around this muthafucka
This rap game, I got my hand around this muthafucka
Yeah I said game but I ain't playin' around this muthafucka
Yeah I'm the best to ever do it bitch
And you the best at never doin' shit
If you the shit then I'm sewer rich
Try me and I'll have your people readin' eulogies
I swear you can't fuck with me
But I can fuck yo girl and make her nut for me
Then slut for me then kill for me then steal for me and of course it'll be yo cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to yo ass

[Chorus:]
And we don't want no problems, OK your a goon what's a goon to a goblin
Yeah, big Kane on the beat, I fuck around and leave a nigga brains on the street(ooohhh)
Now pop that pussy I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh huh and we be steady mobbin' oh Kimosabe big ballin' is my hobby

[Lil Wayne:]
Uh, man suck my clip
Swallow my bullets
And dontchu spit (ooohhh)
I am the hip hop socialist
Life is a gamble and I'm all about my poker chips
Do you want a dose of this I will make the most of this
F is for ferocious murder your associates
The top is so appropriate
This is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for ya girlfriend to wobble on
Weezy

[Chorus: x2]
And we don't want no problems, OK your a goon what's a goon to a goblin
Yeah big kane on the beat, I fuck around and leave a nigga brains on the street(ooohhh)
Now pop that pussy I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh huh and we be steady mobbin' oh Kimosabe big ballin' is my hobby---Lyrics submitted by kari.
