Hey that's a trip
Why don't you wait a little bit for the acid to kick in?
Learn to love
That'll come down it'll spread you so thin
Go and take the millions
Take the dirty hats and stick them up your ass
I'll take the cheap seats
For my company don't come served inside a glass

Old man and the sea
Doing what you were born to
Shrapnel in my knee
I can't walk and I don't care to

I met a strange bird
Her legs, they were skinny like a child
She roamed this land
Strong willed, free and wild

All the notables in their spine wives
Three hipsters, two merchants, and Kon-Tiki.
They saw the black down off in the midnight skies
Man, you should've seen 'em they were so down in the dumps that evening

I'd do it all for you
but I do it for no one
I'd sing a song for you
But I sing for no one---
