Tell me
What is a life?
A life without colours
Can you see them?
Have the years made us blind?
As a child
Living lifes imagination
Youd close your eyes
And all the colours went wild
Now the outlines been drawn
On an empty page
And Ive opened my eyes

And you you you
You colour me in
Turn me round when Im wrong
You make me strong
You colour me in

Have you ever stopped and listen to your heartbeat?
Did the tears make the colours start to fade?
If all the wrongs we ever did were not forgiven
Time would stop
And the world would turn to grey
You know I carry you with me
Night and day
Yeah youve opened my eyes

And you you you
You colour me in
Turn me round when Im wrong
You make me strong
You colour me in
Yeah you you you
You colour me in
Youre the blue skies above
Youre so easy to love
You colour me in

Pictures of angels
Floating above
We all need
To be painted with love

And you you you
You colour me in
Turn me round when Im wrong
You make me strong
You colour me in
And you you you
You colour me in
Youre the blue skies above
Yeah youre so easy to love
You colour me in

All right

Give me blue skies
Give me the bright light
I need some colour in my life (2x)

Give me blue skies
Give me the bright light
I want some colour in my life
In my life---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
