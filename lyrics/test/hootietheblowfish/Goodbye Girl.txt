All your life you've waited
For love to come and stay
And now that I have found you
You must not slip away

I know it's hard believin'
The words you've heard before
Darlin', you must trust them please
Trust them just once more

'Cause baby, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you, goodbye
Doesn't mean we'll never be together again

If you wake up and I'm not there, I won't be long away oh
'Cause the things you do, my goodbye girl
Will bring me back to you

I know you've been taken
Afraid to hurt again
You fight the love you feel for me
Instead of givin' in

And I can wait forever, oh
A helpin' you to see
And I was meant for you, my love
And you were meant for me

Remember, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you, goodbye
Doesn't mean we'll never be together again

Though we may be so far apart you still have my heart
So forget your past, my goodbye girl
Now you're home at last, bye bye

Though we may be so far apart you still have my heart
So forget your past, my goodbye girl
Now you're home at last, oh it doesn't mean forever

Oh goodbye, doesn't mean we'll never be together
Oh oh, good bye doesn't mean we'll never
We remember, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye girl---
