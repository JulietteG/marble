I know she said
Before you left me you were free
So I'll just lay me down

Control has left me
And I can't feel another thing
So let me turn around

Do you really want to play these games
Just to keep things going
Or are you ready now to let it be
It's like sometimes you want to see the rain
But the sun gets in your eyes
And you want to die now

Control has left me
And I can't feel another thing
So let me turn around
I see I see
But things just couldn't be the same
So let me hold you down

Never let me down I swore to you
But now I lied
I'm here to make it all seem worth while

You want I know
But I'll have to try
To find a way to make me quiet now

Control has left me
And I can't feel another thing, so let me turn around
I see I see
But things just couldn't be the same
So won't you hunt her down

I know she said
Before you left me you were free
So I'll just lay me down---
