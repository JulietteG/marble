The Cat, the Crow, and the Snake

Oh, oh... (22)

There was a Garden, and there was a Tree.
And there were three of me.
I was a Snake, and a Crow, and a Cat.
And in the Tree, the three of me sat
For Eternity
And that was that.

One night, an Apple grew.
And the Apple knew everything that I knew.
It was part of me, and it was part of the Tree.
The Tree that I climbed-in to, and flew-in to, and slithered-to,
And now I grew,
And there I sat
As an Apple, and a Snake, and a Crow, and a Cat.

And that was pretty much that, until one day,
A Girl who was not me came out to play.
And I could see what she wanted from me.
She wanted to know what the Apple knew.

And I said, "You already do, my dear,
Otherwise you wouldn't be here".
And She said, "Please I've come to eat the Apples
From the Trees".
And I said, "No. I am an Apple, and a Snake, and a Cat, and a Crow."

And she said, "Please! I need to have that Apple inside of me".
She wanted to know everything I knew.
And I said, "But my dear, you already do".

Then she stamped her foot, and said, "For Heaven's sake!
Why can't you be a Cat, and a Crow, and a Snake?"

And I said, "No. Let the Apple go".
Then she took a bite.
And I could tell, that she knew I was right.
She walked away weeping with the Apple in her hand,
And fed my secrets to another man.

So I slid away, and flew away,
And out the Tree, I ran.
I who once was one, now forever three.
A Cat, and a Crow, and a Snake without a Tree.
Just a Snake, and a Crow, and a Cat,
And that was that.---Lyrics submitted by Abner B Ortiz.
