Mama don't cry for me papa don't feel bad, 
cold are the streets that I gotta keep, 
they bang so we bang back. 
So I rep my hood my city my burrow so thoroughly thats all i have 
yeah oh yeah...

father if you're still listening we hope our prayers make it up to heaven,
and if we fall we are not forgotten 
don't our little brothers don't end up like we did.
let him grow up and get a job, don't let him grow up behind bars, tryin to be hard. oh father can you swift-en my feet, dressed in the wrong color on the wrong street with no heat, rocking dickies and chuckas bandannas my brothers, haters and lovers we still got each other, so we twist our hands up and pull our pants up walk this way throw you flag and your set up, 
Mama don't cry for me papa don't feel bad, 
cold are the streets that I gotta keep, they bang so we bang back 
so I rep my hood my city my burrow so thoroughly thats all we have 
you gotta cook beef or you don't eat and thats why we fly our flags 
I heard your mob and your moody 
your jackin for jewelry 
you bangin and beastin with your tats and your twolies? 
banging for bounty you too young for the nineties 
where you were jumping to G rap or jump into the county. 
Shooting by the roof and strappin is whats happenin,
 Niggas willin to battle so ??? platinum and crackin,
 if you going out tonight your pistol and your rifle
 pray to the father and sell your soul to disciple. 
you come here nigga listen, no bouncin ain't no bitchin 
you cookin in the kitchen flags and finger flippin. 
Living without growing chillin with blow and 
this gang is a gun its either given or chosen.
 Trying to get the trigger strap trying to get the niggas back 
worst part of the deal it won't help bring our nigga back.
 Tell your babies that you love em 
kiss your mama before you leave her
 hug her like you need her in case its the last time you see her. 

 Mama don't cry for me papa don't feel bad, 
cold are the streets that we gotta keep,
 they bang so we bang back 
so we rep our hood our city our burrow so thoroughly thats all we have 
you gotta cook beef or you don't eat and thats why we fly our flags 

the streets are so slick they greasy 
as a need to feed the needy. 
Easy to murder if you hungry or greedy. 
gang sets and graffiti. i mean we mean like eedy? 
I mean I mean  I need a pact or treaty or take my war to Tahiti. 
Throw your flag like stockin nothing but war on TV. 
R.I.P. to passy up in heaven in platinum tee pee.  
Agressive is the message no lessons without the effing bang bang
 live by the gun die by the gang its a flag thang. 

Mama don't cry for me papa don't feel bad, 
cold are the streets that we gotta keep, 
they bang so we bang back 
so we rep our hood our city our burrow so thoroughly thats all we have 
you gotta cook beef or you don't eat 
and thats why we fly our flags.---Lyrics submitted by skylar.
