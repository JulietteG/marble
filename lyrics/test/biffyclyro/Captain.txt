Angels fall to the floor
Like they would if I was captain
"Silver children," She roared
"I'm not the son of God"
Somebody help me sing
Can anybody hear me?
Liars and lovers combine tonight
We're gonna make a scene

Somebody help me sing whoaaa oh oh
Somebody help me sing whoaaa oh oh

Help me be captain of
Our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath
It's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder
I can't ride your horse
I've swallowed half an hourglass
So now the landscape is swollen up

I gave birth to a fire
It's like it's features where burning
I'm in control, I am the son of God
Somebody help me sing
Can anybody hear me?
Line up your soldiers one final time
We're gonna have a ball

Somebody help me sing whoaaa oh oh
Somebody help me sing whoaaa oh oh

Help me be captain of
Our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath
It's time for surprises
I can't climb up your ladder
I can't ride your horse
I've swallowed half an hourglass
So now the landscape is swollen up

Let's throw death away
