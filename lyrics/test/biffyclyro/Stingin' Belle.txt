You say love, I say killin time 
Whats mine is yours, yours is mine 
You make me laugh, I make you cry 
I guess that rhymes 

Youre contained by floors and walls 
Im contained by your control 
Youre overthrown but underworn 
I told you so 
Were singing for the stinging belle 
Surely lost her way 
Claiming all the simple times 
Inside her tragic day 

Grow some balls and speak your mind 
You think youre cool like a porcupine 
Youre more like doves, theyre taking flight 
The sky is mine 

Were singing for the stinging belle 
Surely lost her way 
Claiming all the simple times 
Inside her tragic day
