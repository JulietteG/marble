Spinning around an open space
Until our heads forget the ride
Feel like i can, feel like i can
Once again we rise from the grave
In the street wide open
Space between the stars and the end
Lets embrace this moment
And it's the end of something new
You'll be there
Our hearts collide 
From something new
You'll be there
But it's the end of something

Spinning around and open space
Until our heads forget the ride
Feel like i can, feels like i am
Feel like i can

Even if the stars fall on me

My heart is yearning for
My heart, my heart is yearning for
My heart my heart is yearning for my heart 
My heart is yearning for my heart

Is yearning for my heart---Lyrics submitted by Kitten Ring.
