I talk to god as much
As I talk to satan
'Cause I wanna hear both sides
Does that make me cynical,
There are no miracles and
This is no miraculous life
I savour hate as much as I crave love
Because I'm just a twisted guy
Is this the pinnacle, Is this the pinnacle
The pinnacle of being alive?
Now I see the light

Well I look up to god
But I see trouble
'Cause this ain't a miracle
I just want to take my chance
To live through a miracle

I know for certain that someone
Is watching but is it from up or down?
I make you miserable you stick with me
Although you know I'm gonna
Ruin your life
We walk into the tide

Well I look up to god
But I see trouble
'Cause this ain't a miracle
I just want to take my chance
To live through a miracle

When the see-saw snaps and splinters your hand
Don't come crying to me
I'll only see your good side
And believe it's a miracle, a miracle

I slap the water and watch the fish dance
To the ripples of us
We're just dull blue duds
Blinking eyes encased in rust
This ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle
This ain't a miracle
Ooohhh---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
