It's getting close
to sundown over the Sierra
Stranded on the freeway
burning with desire
She was on the sidewalk
looking for a night light
We talked
about the real things
And drove into the fire
Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Is filling with the rain
Candy apple red dress
Bleeding when she kissed me
Heaven in a ragtop
Take away my pain

When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
Move across the night
Like a seperate wind

Pulled up to a motel
"Vacancy" was buzzing
Pink and dirty neon
Settle on the hood
Wrap your arms around me
Come a little closer
Stumble in the twilight
And fell onto the floor
Loving Mona Lisa
Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door

When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
Move across the night
Like a seperate wind

When your hopes and dreams
Lose the will to go
Joyride
Reaching for the light
Knowing we can't win

Theres something
in the distance
A glorious existance
A simple celebration
A place
you've never been before
Tell me that you wanna go

Reaching for the light
knowing we can't win

When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride

All your hopes and dreams
All you need to know
Joyride---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
