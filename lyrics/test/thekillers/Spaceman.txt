It started with a low light,
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed;
And then they took my blood type,
It left a strange impression in my head.
You know that I was hoping,
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind;
But when they cut me open,
I guess I changed my mind.
And you know I might
Just walk too far from the floor this time,
'Cause they calling me by my name!
And the shimmering white lighting
Disregards the bombs and satellites!

That was the turning point;
That was one lonely night!

The song maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's going make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down!
It's all in your mind!"

Well now I'm back at home, and-
I'm looking forward to this life I live;
You know it's gonna haunt me,
So hesitation to this life I give.
You think you might cross over,
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea;
You better look it over,
Before you make that leap!

And you know I'm fine, but I hear those voices at night
Sometimes... they justify my claim,
And the public don't ground my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised...

Oh, it was the turning point,
It was the lonely night!

The song maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's going make you mad;
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down!
It's all in your mind!"

The song maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's going make you mad;
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down!
It's all in your mind!"

My global position systems are vocally addressed;
They say the Nile used to run from east to west,
They say the Nile used to run... from east to west.

The song maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's going make you mad;
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down!
It's all in your mind!"
The song maker says, "It ain't so bad"
The dream maker's going make you mad;
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down...
It's all in your mind!"
It's all in my mi-i-ind,
It's all in my mind...
It's all in my mind...
It's all in my mind...
It's all in my... mind---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
