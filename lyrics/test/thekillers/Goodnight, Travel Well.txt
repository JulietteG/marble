the unknown distance
to the great beyond
stares back at my grieving frame
to cast my shadow by the holy sun
my spirit moans with a sacred pain
and it's quiet now
the universe is standing still

there's nothing I can say
there's nothing we can do now
there's nothing I can say
there's nothing we can do now

and all that stands
between the souls release(?)
this temporary flesh and bone
we know that it's over now
I feel my faded mind
begin to roam

every time you fall
and every time you try
every foolish dream
and every compromise
every word you spoke
and everything you said
everything you left me,
rambles in my head

there's nothing I can say
there's nothing I can do now
there's nothing I can say
there's nothing I can do now

up above the world so high

and everything you loved
and every time you try
everybody's watching
everybody cry

stay, don't leave me
the stars can't for your sign
don't signal now

and there's nothing I can say
there's nothing I can do now
there's nothing I can say
there's nothing we can do now

goodnight, travel well
goodnight, travel well

and there's nothing I can say
there's nothing I can do now---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
