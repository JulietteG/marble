(feat. Dawes)

Woke up, the sun streaming in my room
Warm beach from palm December afternoon
You close your eyes
Another year blows by
Somewhere in the wind
Just another life

My parents sent a Christmas card and then its true
We understand youre staying
And were proud of you
Theres a well-rehearsed disinterest in the atmosphere
I dont know if thats what this time gave me
Or if it lead me here

And I played so many parts
I dont know which ones really me
Dont know if I can take

Another Christmas in L.A.
Another pitcher of Sangria
In an empty beach caf
Another Christmas in L.A.
Hold me tighter Carmelita
I dont know how long I can stay

Left a girl behind in my old mans truck
Sometimes I wonder where she ended up
Maybe she got married, had a couple of kids
Who do you think youre fooling man?
Of course she did

Im walking in that tennis bar
Try and talk with Harry Bean
I dont know if I can take

Another Christmas in L.A.
Another casting call on Thursday
For a job that doesnt pay
Another Christmas in L.A.
Another burnout in a tank top
It seems your basket is the case
A fat protagonist in flip flops
With an extensive resume
From Echo Park to Catalina

Dreaming of a white Christmas
The one I used to know
Tree tops glisten, children listen
To sleigh bells in the snow

Another Christmas in L.A... ---
