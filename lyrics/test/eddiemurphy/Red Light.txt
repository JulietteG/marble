Oh yeah!

Redlight
Stop right there where you are
Redlight
Stop right there where you are
(There where you are)

Out of the frying pan, into the fire
Burning down the peoples souls
My high anxiety is getting higher
Feels like Im gonna blow
Gone is the breeze that used to be so sweet
Poison is the wind that blows
It cant be long till the military come
With a knock, knock, knock on your door
Alright

Redlight
Stop right there where you are
This is a redlight
Stop right there where you are
(Stop there where you are)

(Gone) Emancipation
(Gone) Race relation
(Gone) Most of the rebels are gone
(Gone) The trust in nation
(Gone) The time were wastin
(Gone) The peoples patience is gone

Broken economy, the streets are dire
Even more than before
I need some betterness to take me higher
Feels like Im gonna blow
Gone are the days when people used to say
Everything is alright
No place to run, now here your karma a come
With a knock, knock, knock on your door

Redlight. Stop right there where you are
This is a redlight. Stop right there where you are
(Stop there where you are)
Redlight. Stop right there where you are
Redlight. Stop right there where you are
(Stop there where you are)

Pick up the pieces, let it begin, cause this is the way that we flow
Higher and higher and higher we go
Through dedication, self-preservation Hailie (high) Selassie (high)

(Gone) Marcus Garvey, Montgomery, Martin
(Gone) All the rebels are gone
(Gone) Weve lost our way
(Gone)Darkness is the day
(Gone) Most of the rebels are gone
Redlight
Redlight
Redlight

We can ride, we can roll, we can breathe
We can talk, we can walk, we can stop
At the redlight
We can smoke, we can do what we want
And be real with the blunt, we just stop
At the redlight

Well stay true, and be you
And be up way above with no pushin or shovin
We can ride, we can roll, we can breathe
We can talk, we can walk, well just stop
At the redlight
We can smoke, we can do what we want
And be real with the blunt, we just stop
At the redlight
Well stay true, and be you
And be up way above with no pushin or shovin
