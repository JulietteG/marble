Dance boogie wonderland
Dance boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts,
Of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand,
To a woman that has laid to many bets

The mirror stares you in the face and says
Baby, uh uh it dont work
You say your prayers through you dont care
You dance and shake the hurt
Dance boogie wonderland
Dance boogie wonderland

Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl drams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland

All the love in the world cant be gone
All the need to be loved cant be wrong
All the records are playing
And my heart keeps saying
Boogie wonderland, wonderland
Dance boogie wonderland
Dance boogie wonderland

All the love in the world cant be gone
All the need to be loved cant be wrong
All the records are playing
And my heart keeps saying
Boogie wonderland, wonderland
Dance boogie wonderland
Dance boogie wonderland---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
