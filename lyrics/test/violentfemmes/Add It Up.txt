Day after day
I will walk, and I will play
But the day, after today
I will stop, and I will start

Why can't I get just one kiss?
Why can't I get just one kiss?
Believe me some things that I wouldn't miss
But I look at your pants and I need a kiss.

Why can't I get just one screw?
Why can't I get just one screw?
Believe me I'd know what to do.
But something won't let me make love to you.

Why can't I get just one fuck?
Why can't I get just one fuck?
Guess it's got something to do with luck
But I've waited my whole life for just one

Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I take a bow and say goodnight

Oh my my my my my oh my mum
Have you kept your eye
Your eye on your son?
I know you've had problems
You're not the only one
When your sugar left, he left you on the run

So, oh my my my my my mo my mum
Take a look now at what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
You went downtown and got him a gun.

Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me 

Walkin down the kitchen at the top of the stairs
Can I mix in with your affairs?
Share a smoke, make a joke
Grasp and reach for a leg of hope
Words to memorize, words hypnotize
Words make my mouth exercise
Words all fail the magic prize
Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs

Oh my my my my my mo my mother
I would love to love you lover
City is restless
It's ready to pounce
Here in your bedroom ounce for ounce
Sayin' oh my my my my my mo my mother
I would love to love you lover
The city is restless
It's ready to pounce
Here in your bedroom ounce for ounce

I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose, things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says wait a minute honey I'm gonna add it up
Gonna add it up, add it up, 
Eh add it up, add it up
Oh, add it up, add it up
See whatcha you got
You gotta to add it up baby.

Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I take a bow and say goodnight---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
