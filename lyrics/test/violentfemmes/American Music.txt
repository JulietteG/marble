Can I put in something like..this is American music take 1

Do you like american music
I like american music
Dont you like american music baby

I want you to hold me
I want your arms around me
I want you to hold me ME.....Baaaby

Do you do too many drugs
I did too many drugs
Did you do too many drugs too baby

You were born too late, 
I was born too soon
Every time I look at that ugly moon, 
it reminds me of you, it reminds me of you

I need a date to the prom,
Would you like to come along,
Nobody go to the prom with me, baby

Its like American Music
they never heard American music
And its all the music in my soul,baby

You were born too soon
I was born too late
But every time I look at the ugly lake
it reminds of you.

We like American music we like american music

You like american music
we like american music
I like american music
BABY
you like american music
we like all kinds of music
but I like american music best baby

You were born too late
I was born too late
but every time i look at that ugly lake
it reminds me of you---Lyrics submitted by ross pukallus.
