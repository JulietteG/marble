Baby cried the day the circus came to town
'Cause she didn't want parades just passin' by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
And she danced without a net upon the wire

I know a lot about her 'cause, you see
Baby is an awful lot like me

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside, just learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all

Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
They left behind her dreams among the litter
And the different kind of love she thought she'd found
It was nothin' left but sawdust and some glitter

But baby can't be broken 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher, that was me, and I told 'er

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside and learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
Then if you should fall, remember you almost had it all

Don't cry out loud
You gotta it inside, learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all

Girl, don't cry out loud
You gotta keep it inside, you learn how to hide the feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, well baby you all knows, you almost had it all---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
