False pretender, stop pretending
All gals single have dem singing, watch this

See, ain't no use pretending
You don't feel the way I do
With this message that your body's sending
Well, I can tell you want it too

Well, do you wanna hide the way you feel inside
It's too late to turn back now
Every little touch, it means so much
So, girl just let me show you how

Your body can't lie to me
'Cuz I know just what you're needing
Your body can't lie to me
'Cuz you're in need of some sexual healing

Me have, me have, me have
Di remedy fi mi heart
Me have di remedy fi di brain
Me have agony fi di body
Fi make yuh choo-choo like a train

Remedy fi di heart
Me have di remedy fi di
Me have agony fi di body

Extreme a love

Circulating by vein

Yuh just holler out me name

Let my caresses take you places
Where ya never been before
To the edge of your desire
Where you want it more and more

But do you want a prize, turn out the lights
Come let's make tonight the night
There's no resisting, love is insisting
Come let's make it right tonight

Cho, cho me have di remedy fi yuh heart
Me have di remedy fi yuh brain
Me have di agony fi yuh body

I'm di doctor, not a heart breaker
I'm a love maker fi lovin', I'm not a shaper

She's like the patient in the doctor's hand
It's like a computer social program
Go tell di world, she want a lovin' man

Your body can't lie to me
'Cuz I know just what you're needing
Your body can't lie to me
'Cuz you're in need of some sexual healing

An' I know what is the meaning

Do you wanna hide the way you feel inside
