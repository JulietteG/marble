(verse one:slug)
came to get an oil change for ma girlfriends car
but by the time i left i was short of breath and broken hearted(there she was)
there she was
bent over a motor dirty cap wit a ponny tail that sat between her shoulders(beautiful)
with an oil streak that most of kissed you sheek bone
thick and volumptuous i wish that we could be alone (i would love to)
i would love to touch you rub you 
see whats covered up under that greesy blue jump suite(come on)
standing there holdin that dripn n dip stick 
wit a firm grip yet so delacate
and the way you took that orange oil rang and wiped it clean its garenteed to get repeated in my dream(alright)
you make me wild feels like puppy love got me lost in your smile wen you asked me wat the mileage was
and if i ever learned how to change my own oil
i promise that this customer is gonna remain so loyal(dirty girl)

(verse2:murs)
now theres this hamburger stand 30 minutes out of town
used to go for the best vegie burgers around
thats was until i met this brown garenteed to a sound
short order chef eyes deeper than sound
she wore a dirty green aprin like a silk night gown
those capuccino finger nails wrote my order down
three dots tattooed between her thumb and her index
twenty-four waist held the hoster for the windex
heat from the grill made her mascara drip
the sweat on her face showed the fuz on her lip
them work pant couldnt hide the love in them hips
call it bad taist but this girl was the shit
its the way that hair net kinda covered up her ear
had me askin why the fuck she was even workin here
but next time i get hungry ima drive to pasadena
cuz i jus gotta see her mi linda cochina muah!
