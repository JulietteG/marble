Woh-oh-oh- i remember as the 1945
Oh-oh- deliver your message from 1945

Vast blue skies fly deep into dazzling white clouds
Red dragon with clear eyes flying so happily together
Wiping rolling any tears  fighting for your loved ones
The sounds of an engine with going young blossom like your life

"Running away is defeat, without a fight you lost your soul"
We will support out precious land you sacrificed for

The last word you wrote in that day of small diary
Hoping your sacrifice would bring everlasting peace
Your life teaches me "where is the flower?" through the sunset
The truth of our country landed here  the wind is together

Left hand is driving around the world and we are held down
Hoping to live through a fragile dream, but we will not give up ever

Little bit running out of control America once shaken by this country
We still talk with pride and gratitude about our courageous grandfathers

Woh-oh-oh- my heart shines in 1945
Oh-oh- i remember as the 1945
Oh-oh- deliver your message from 1945
Oh-oh- deliver your message from 1945---Lyrics submitted by Bart Allen.
