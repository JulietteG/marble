(chorus)
Without you theres no reason for my story
and when im with you I can always act the same
forever yeah if we're together
we can make it better

You and I 
We'll never get to sleep
we're up all day
we're overworked and underpaid
You and I 
We're always talkin repeat day by day
watchin time drift aways
we burn away         

(chorus)        

You and I
we've never felt so right
that might just be just I need(to get me through the night)
You and I 
We're the perfect fit you've got me hooked 
So lit i can never quit 
just burn away
