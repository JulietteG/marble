I wouldn't kill to win a war
I don't get what they do it for
It's all so terribly vague
I see the picture from a thousand years of
Battles and I think it's such a bore

I walk New Orleans with a knife
Like makkie hidden out of sight
But I'd be useless if they jumped
I'm really not the killing type

I'm not the killing type
I'm not the killing type
I'm not I'm not 
I'm not the killing type I'm not

I've got a picture of your mum
Before the war when she was young
She's got an etching to her right
I think it's funny that she's looking to the left and it's her son

I wouldn't kill to get you back
And I've officially been asked
I couldn't kill to safe a life
I'd rather die a peaceful piece of shit-bait shame-filled coward
Thanks

I'm not the killing type
I'm not the killing type
I'm not I'm not 
I'm not the killing type I'm not

But I would kill to make you feel
I don't mean kill someone for real
I couldn't do that, it is wrong
But I can say it in a song a song a song

And I'm saying it
NOW
I'm saying it 
SO
Even if you never hear this song somebody else will know
Know know know

I just can't explain how good it feels
I just can't explain how good it feels
I just can't explain how good it feels
I just can't describe

I once stepped on a dying bird
It was a mercy killing I couldn't sleep
For a week I kept feeling it's breaking bones
I heard

That if you see a star at night
And the conditions are just right
And you are standing on a cliff
Then you can close your eyes 
And make a wish
And take a step
and change somebody's life

I'm not the killing type
I'm not the killing type
I'm not I'm not 
I'm not the killing type I'm not

But I would kill to make you feel
I'd kill to move your face an inch
I see you staring into space
I wanna stick my fist into your mouth and twist your arctic heart, yes!

But I would kill to make you feel
I don't mean kill someone for real
I couldn't do that, it is wrong
But I can say it in a song a song a song

And I'm saying it
NOW
I'm saying it 
SO
Even if you never hear this song somebody else will know
Know know know

I just can't explain how good it feels
I just can't explain how good it feels
I just can't explain how good it feels
I just can't describe ibe ibe ibe
DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE
