I cant get them up
I cant get them up
I cant get them up at all
Hey ho let go

Good morning, killer king, youre a star
Thats gorgeous, hold it right where you are
The weather's kinda lousy today
So what oh what oh whatll we play?

Stratcaster strapped to your back
It's semi-automatic like dads
He taught you how to pause and reset
And thats about as far as you get

So whats the use in going outside?
It's so depressing when people die in real life
Id rather pick up right where we left
Making out to faces of death
Making out to faces of death

And I could save you baby 
But it isnt worth my time
And I could make you chase me
For a little price is right

Its a hit but are you actually sure?
The targets in the crowd are a blur
The people screaming just like they should
But you don't even know if you're good
But you don't even know if you're good

So tie them up and feed them the sand
Ha! Rigga! try hard to tell us using your hands
A picture's worth a million words
And that way nobody gets hurt
And that way nobody gets hurt

And I could save you baby 
But it isnt worth my time
And I can make you chase me
For a little price is right

Youre my guitar hero
Youre my guitar hero
Youre my guitar hero
Youre my guitar hero

X marks the box in the hole in the ground that goes off at a breath
So careful dont make a sound
X marks the box in the hole in your head that you dug for yourself
Now lie in it

Shut up about all of that negative shit
You wanted to make it and now that youre in
You shut your eyes and flip the cassette
And thats about the time that they hit
And thats about the time that they hit

What the fuck is up with this shit?
Its certainly not worth getting upset
His hands are gone and most of his head
And just when he was getting so good
Just when he was getting so good

And I could save you baby
But it isnt worth my time
'Cause even if I saved you
Theres a million more in line

Youre my guitar hero
Youre my guitar hero
Youre my guitar hero
Youre my guitar hero
Youre my guitar hero---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
