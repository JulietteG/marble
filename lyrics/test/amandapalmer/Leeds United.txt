We watch you, you're expert double exes.
It's just like you to paint those whiter fences

It's so polite, it's so polite it's offensive, it's offensive
It's so unright, it's so unright, it's a technical, accept it

But who needs love when there's Law & Order?
And who needs love when there's Southern Comfort?
And who needs love at all?

We stalk you, you're expert double exes
We oxidize you in your sleep there's no exit, there's no exit

You're on a roll, you're on a roll, no one gets it, no one gets it
Your honor, no. your honor, can't you protect us, protect us?

But who needs love when there's Law & Order?
And who needs love when there's Southern Comfort?
And who needs love
When the sandwiches are wicked and they know you at the Mac store?

I'm so excited
The blacks and beat kids
I'm getting frightened
Someday someday Leeds United

Bugsy Malone came to carry you home and they're taking you all to the doctor
Burberry voices all sugary spices it's nice but its not what I'm after
Sure, I admire you
Sure, you inspire me but you've been not getting back so
I'll wait at the Sainbury's counting my change making BANK on the upcoming roster

And we'll stop you, you're expert double exes
Oh yeah, a big stock holder extra cold with 2 exes
That 'never talking' thing you do is effective, it's effective
Your shoulder's icy colder, oh than a death wish, than a death wish

But who needs love when there's Law & Order?
And who needs love when there's Dukes of Hazard?
And who needs love
When the sandwiches are wicked and they know you at the Mac store?

I'm so excited
The blacks and beat kids
They're so excited
When I think about Leeds uniting
I'm getting frightened
The blacks, the blacks, the blacks, and beat kids
It's so exciting
Someday, someday, someday, someday, someday, someday
Leeds United---Lyrics submitted by Najia.
