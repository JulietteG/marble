Cry out all night till there was nothing more.
What use am I as a heap on the floor?
Heaving devotion but it's just no good
Taking it hard just like you knew I would.

O-o-old habits die hard when you got, when you got a sentimental heart.
Piece of the puzzle, you're my missing part.
Oh what can you do with a sentimental heart?

Cry out all night till there was nothing more.
What use am I as a heap on the floor?
Heaving devotion but it's just no good
Taking it hard just like you knew I would.

O-o-old habits die hard when you got, when you got a sentimental heart.
Piece of the puzzle, you're my missing part.
Oh what can you do with a sentimental heart?
Oh what can you do with a sentimental heart?
Oh what can you do with a sentimental heart?---Lyrics submitted by Andrea.
