for those of you who tried but didn't make it
settle down it's never what you think
to some it doesn't differ from the big dark valley
and the valley doesn't differ from the kitchen sink

for those of you who thought you'd be forgotten
the friends you've made will try their best to make it so
think of all the beauty that you have left behind you
you can take it if you want it
and then let it go

(chorus)
and this is not a test
no this is not a test
taking numbers never made sense, anyways
no this is not a test
no this is not a test
cause you can have it if you want it anyways

for those of us who try to keep remembering 
try to do our better than our best
think of all the children and the drifts of snow
winners never quit but winters never rest

repeat chorus---Lyrics submitted by whitney.
