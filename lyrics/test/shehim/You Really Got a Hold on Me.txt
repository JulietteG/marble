i dont like you, but i love you
seems that im always thinking of you
ohhhhhh you treat me badly i love you madly
you really got a hold me(you really got a hold on me)
you really got a hold on me(you really got a hold one me)

i dont want you but i need you
dont wanna kiss you but i need to
ohhhh you do me wrong now, my love is strong now
you really got a hold me(you really got a hold on me)
you really got a hold on me(you really got a hold one me)

i love you and i all i want you to do is just
hold me hold me hold me hold me.

i wanna leave you dont wanna stay here
i dont wanna spend another day here
ohhh you do me wrong now my love strong now
you really got a hold me(you really got a hold on me)
i said you really got a hold on me(you really got a hold one me)

i love you and all i want you to do is just
hold me hold me hold me hold me....
