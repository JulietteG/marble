My eyes are so bleary
I guess I'm young but I feel so weary
I tried to express it
but I think it's all a bore
It's at the heart of me
a very part of me

Speak slowly, I can't hear you, 
my mind keeps spinning
Closer and closer 
to the rain on the roof 
and the rain in my head
and the things that you said 
keep on sinking further ahead
and it just gets so foggy 
It's nowhere in here
and it everywhere else 
that I don't want to be
But I'm stuck here,
getting misty over you
I'm alone, on a bicycle for two

Speak slowly, I can't hear you, 
my mind keeps spinning
Closer and closer 
to the rain on the roof 
and the rain in my head
and the things that you said 
keep on sinking further ahead
and it just gets so foggy 
It's nowhere in here
and it everywhere else 
that I don't want to be
But I'm stuck here,
getting misty over you
I'm alone, on a bicycle for two---Lyrics submitted by Kylee.
