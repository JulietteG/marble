Where there is hatred
Let me bring love
Where there is doubt
Let me bring faith
Where there is false hope
Let me bring truth
Where there is pain
Ill comfort you

Where there is silence
Let me sing praise
Where theres despair
Let me bring hope
Where there is blindness
Let me bring sight
Where there is darkness
Let me bring light

And with these words I speak
Grant that I may not seek
To be heard, but to hear
To be consoled, but to console
Not to be seen, but to see
To be loved, but to love

For when we give love
We will receive
When we forgive love
Well find reprieve
It is in dying
Well be released

Make me an instrument of peace

of peace

 of Peace.---Lyrics submitted by P.
