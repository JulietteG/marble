Hopelessly devoted to you

guess mine is not the first heart broken.	
My eyes are not the first to cry 
I'm not the first to know there's just no getting over you

I know I'm just a fool who's willin' to sit around an wait for you
but baby can't you see there's nothin' else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

but now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head hopelessly devoted to you 
hopelessly devoted to you
hopelessly devoted to you

my head is sayin' fool forget him 
my heart is sayin' don't let go
hold on till  the end and that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted  to you

but now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head hopelessly devoted to you 
hopelessly devoted to you
hopelessly devoted to you---Lyrics submitted by Teresa.
