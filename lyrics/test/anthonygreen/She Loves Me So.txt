I keep writing myself into rust, its all around us
Get naked and get into bed right away
I keep writing myself into ruts,and make it all seem so much longer
But soon, you'll be far away,keep those lonely hands in your pockets and fold away all your best clothes
I'm only truly happy if I know

She loves me so,she loves me so
She loves me so,she loves me so

I keep writing myself into rust, its all around us
Get naked and get in my arms as fast as you can, as fast as you can
I keep writing myself into rust, and make it all feel so much better
But soon, you'll be far away, keep those lonely eyes to yourself and fold away just fold yourself away
And make sure all those mother fucking boys know

That she loves me so,she loves me so
She loves me so,she loves me so
She loves me so, she does---Lyrics submitted by ryan.
