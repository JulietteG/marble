Mr. Telephone man
There's something wrong with my line,
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click everytime
Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click every time

When I dial 661 Computer Service
She said "Hello may I help you
please?"
I told her something must be wrong
With my phone
Cause my baby wouldn't hang up
on me

Mr. Telephone Man
There something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number I get a
Click every time

Mr. Telephone Man
There something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby's number I get a
Click every time

She let the phone ring 20 times
Before she answered
Let me tell you what happened then
A minute later I got the operator
Saying please hang up and place
Your call agian

Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with
My line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click everytime
Mr. Telephone Man,
Soemthing's wrong with my line
I try to dial her number
I get a click everytime

Soem strange man is on the
telephone
He keeps telling me my baby
Aint home
She got no party line
Situation blowing my mind
Oh, I just can't take this anymore

Please operator
See what you can do,
I dialed the right number
But I still couldn't get through
Could you just check the line
Just one more time if you can
I'm pretty sure her phone
Wouldn't be answered by no man

Mr. Telephone Man
There's something wrong with
My line
When I dial my baby's number
I get a click everytime
Mr. Telephone Man,
Soemthing's wrong with my line
I try to dial her number
I get a click everytime

Must be a bad connection
I give her my love and affection
I just can't take this no more
This situation blowing my mind
blowing my mind
Can't get my baby on the line

I tried dialing information (Mr. Telephone Man)
I can't get no coperation (Mr. Telephone Man)
Her sister's on the phone telling me my baby
Aint at home
Come on baby I just can't take it no more

Help me out
please Mr. Telephone Man
Help me out
please Mr. Telephone Man---Lyrics submitted by nadjah.
