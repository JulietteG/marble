Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much 'bout geography
Don't know much o' trigonometry
Don't know much about the algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for

But I know that one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful this would be

Now, I don't claim to be an "A" student
But I'm trying to be
I think-a maybe my being an "A" student baby
I can win your love for me

Don't know about the middle-ages
Look at the picture i just turn the pages
Don't know much about the rise and fall
Don't know much about nothing at all
Because it's you that I've been dreaming of
And if I could only win your love for me
What a wonderful world this would be

I think-a maybe my being an "A" student baby
I can win your love for me

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about science books
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

What a wonderful this would be
Call out your name when you're not around ---Lyrics submitted by bouba.
