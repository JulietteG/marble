Don't go back on your default baby,
I know it hurts,
I can see how hard youre trying
Don't let go now
Wait for the morning,
Wait for the morning dawn.

Write me a letter pen and paper,
I'll hear you out,
Whisper quiet tell me try me,
I'm with you love,
Wait for the morning dawn..---Lyrics submitted by Laura Smith.
