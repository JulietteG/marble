Sun been down for days
A pretty flower in a vase
A slipper by the fireplace
A cello lying in its case

Soon she's down the stairs
Her morning elegance she wears
the sound of water makes her dream
Awoken by a cloud of steam
She pours a daydream in a cup
A spoon of sugar sweetens up

And she fights for her life as she puts on her coat
And she fights for her life on the train
She looks at the rain as it pours 
And she fights for her life as she goes in a store
with a thought she has caught by a thread 
She pays for the bread and she goes
... Nobody knows

Sun been down for days
A winter melody she plays the thunder makes her contemplate 
She hears a noise behind the gate
Perhaps a letter with a dove
Perhaps a stranger she could love 

And she fights for her life as she puts on her coat
And she fights for her life on the train
She looks at the rain as it pours 
And she fights for her life as she goes in a store
with a thought she has caught by a thread 
She pays for the bread and she goes
... Nobody knows ... Nobody knows

And she fights for her life as she puts on her coat
And she fights for her life on the train
She looks at the rain as it pours
And she fights for her life as she goes in a store
Where the people are pleasantly strange
And counting the change and she goes
... Nobody knows ... Nobody knows ... Nobody knows---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.
