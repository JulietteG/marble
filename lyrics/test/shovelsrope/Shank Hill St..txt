We're buzzing like a locust
Vibrating right out of my skin
Pounding on the butcher's wall
Somebody come and let me in
There's a black haired woman
Carrying a rolling pin
But your man's got a secret
But she knows where he been yeah
She knows where he been

And it'll be a long time
Before the sun shines
On shank hill street again

You see early in the morning
For the one wind of the dark
She saw a thin man and a shadow
Make their way across the lawn
There was a rustle, was a razor
And a whisper of a prayer
Then the rhythm of the mallet
Like a heartbeat in the air

And it'll be a long time before the sun shines
On shank hill street yeah

With a handshake like a hammer and suicide grin
That wooden door creeked open and the butcherman let me in yes,
Like that, he let me in
But i wasted not a minute, i was on him like a whip
And for one last minute, he'd feel that heart drip (drip, drip...)

And it'll be a long time before the sun shines
On shank hill street---
