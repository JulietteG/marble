Cab fare to nowhere is what you are 
A white line to an exit sign is what you are 
All that I saw in you, now I see through 
Don't shed a tear for me, my life won't end without you 
Long as the night will be, the sun will rise without you 
A locked door on a candy store is what you are 
A slim chance in tight pants is what you are 
All that I loved you for, I wanted more 
Don't shed a tear for me, my life won't end without you 
Long as the night will be, the sun will rise without you 
You ain't giving what I'm not taking 
I'm not missing what we ain't making 
All that I saw in you, now I see through 
Don't shed a tear for me, my life won't end without you 
Long as the night will be, the sun will rise without you 
Don't shed a tear for me, my life won't end without you 
Long as the night will be, the sun will rise without you 
Nooo. Don't shed no tears, 
I don't need
I don't need
I don't need 
A thing. 
I don't need it---Lyrics submitted by Mark.
