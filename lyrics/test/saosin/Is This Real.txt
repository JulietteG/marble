Times rinning out and I haven't been saved
Gotta cast my stone into the 
(I didn't work, It didn't look sacred)
That's all it takes my son then you are safe
When the end comes everything's okay

Save my skin
We're diving in
It doesn't make a difference if I sink or swim
There's a line drawn thin or
so they tell me
I'll never know the difference if we sink or swim

Is it real?The choices that we make
The smiles that we fake
(Is it real?)
I know it hurts but is it 
Real? The choices that we make
The smiles that we fake
For my own sake
I know it hurts but is it...

That I can't stop feeling like I've been betrayed
You should've cast that stone into the lake
(stone into the lake)
Chased in the wrong direction, led astray
And I know you don't believe a single word you say

Save my skin
We're diving in
It doesn't make a difference if I sink or swim
There's a line drawn thin or
so they tell me
I'll never know the difference if we sink or swim

Is it real?The choices that we make
The smiles that we fake
(Is it real?)
I know it hurts but is it 
Real? The choices that we make
The smiles that we fake
For my own sake
I know it hurts but is it...

Real? Is this Real?
I don't want to buy into the lies 
Stare up at the sky but is it
Real? Show me something Real
I don't want to buy into your lies
Stare up at the sky and sing

I surrender myself for this
I take the blame
(I take the blame)
I surrender myself for this
I take the blame
(All for)
Peace or War
For rich or poor
For loss, for gain
For Everything
That I love
I see
I feel I've become
one with what's not real to me
So I'm staring Sideways
Forward
Backwards
Just to Realize we all fall
Down...

Is it real? The choices that we make
The smiles that we fake (Is it real?)
Just tell me is this 
Real? The choices that we make
The smiles that we fake
For my own sake
 know it hurts but is it Real?
Is it Real? (Is it Real?)
I need to know
Is it real?---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
