On my face I scratched out something like a silhouette, around the golden ten like lambs...
On my face I've hidden away any embarrassment, away from my acquaintances...

I'm not sold on anything but half a dream
I'm not sensing a thing.

I see a blank notebook page
And it's my life and there is nothing I can think to write
Not anymore since sensing nothing.

I hope you don't see a thing
Smile through everyone you ever see
So what you gave him the time of day, twist back and end this suffering.

Oh, dance around, I honestly give up and derobe...

I see a blank notebook page
And It's my life and I'm nothing I can think to write
Not anymore, since sensing nothing.

Right side falls heavenly, grace to you, I owe you too
Right side, because, heavenly life should be so easy...

Right side because heavenly, grace to you, 
I owe you too (x2)---Lyrics submitted by cody.
