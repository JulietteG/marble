Sinking, falling in too deep and I regret it
I don't know is all we have left to say
How do we pick ourselves up now
If the clouds bring the rain before we evaporate
I'll never be able to say
I love you
I love you, I love you

Stay bright, little fireflies
Make light before my eyes [x2]

Stay bright, little fireflies
Make light before my eyes [x2]

Thinking about all my regrets and contradictions
Where did I go?
I thought this was the right way
Do I learn to grow up now
Or just fade away under this tree of shame
Or will I be able to say
I love you, I love you

Stay bright, little fireflies
Make light before my eyes [x2]

Stay bright, little fireflies
Make light before my eyes [x2]

(break)

And all you do and all you say
Washes away - away with rain
And all you thought would never change
Washes away, it'll never be the same
'Cause all I see is and all I feel
Takes me away, takes me away

And all you do and all you say
Washes away - away with rain
And all you thought would never change
Washes away, it'll never be the same
Stay bright little fireflies
Make light before my eyes

Stay bright, little fireflies
Make light before my eyes

Stay bright, little fireflies
Make light before my eyes

Wish I could love you
And I don't regret the rain
And now that I'm sinking
I will just say goodbye---Lyrics submitted by yellow.
