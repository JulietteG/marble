so, tell me is it right?
to feel like we're only getting smaller
and if we were to find the feeling
but i'm only treading water
we've made a few mistakes, it's not worth it to say
(we all fall for the sound)

'cause we are the only ones, we will get up
and we are aware, 'cause we've been through it
and we are the only ones, we will carry each other on our own

believe the sound when the truth will send you falling
you see the lights but your mind isn't open
now i hear you calling
we've made a few mistakes, it's not worth it to say
(we all fall for the sound)

'cause we are the only ones, we will get up
and we are aware, 'cause we've been through it
and we are the only ones, we will carry each other on our own

open your eyes and let all the light in
open up your eyes a little more
i'm sure it will soon come out

'cause we are the only ones, we will get up
and we are aware, 'cause we've been through it
and we are the only ones, we will carry each other on our own

open your eyes and let all the light in
open up your eyes a little more
i'm sure it will soon come out---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
