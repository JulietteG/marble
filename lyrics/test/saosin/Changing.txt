You fall apart
Each time you start
To say good-bye
But there is nobody watching
If what you grip
Is set to slip
I don't know why
And this is just the beginning
You have the hopes
To make it last
Its moving past and now you're realizing
That in the past
The dreams you had
May make you feel
Like you were just reciting
Bathing in the afterglow
The chance is looking bright
But we end up--- we can never know
And all i know is we seem to be...

Changing!
Then to turn and walk away!
Fading!
All these lives just turn to gray-ay!
Changing!
Then to turn and walk away!
But the strange thing...
Is that i don't feel a thiiiinnnng...

Its just an axe
Not coming back
And your lost
To replace whats missing
And who to start
To play the part
And now your art
Is a great deception
Bathing in the afterglow
The chance is looking bright
We will never have enough--- we can never know
And all i know is that we seem to be...

Changing!
Then to turn and walk away!
Fading!
All these lives just turn to gray-ay!
Changing!
Then to turn and walk away!
But the strange thing...
Is that i don't feel a thiiiinnnng...

One last breath
To say good-bye
To myself
Another lie
Stripped of all my hearts and tears
Moments lost
And i am sinking to
My world
Drown myself in the
Water
And I am watching my
Life (Life!)
Past (Past!)
Before my eyes
It comes as no suprise...

(You fall apart and then you stop, you fall apart and then you stop, you fall apart and then you...stop!)

Changing!
Then to turn and walk away!
Fading!
All these lives just turn to gray-ay! Now I'm...
Changing!
Then to turn and walk away!
But the strange thing...
Is that i don't feel a thiiiinnnng...

You fall apart
And then you stop
You fall apart
And then you stop
You fall apart
And then you...
Stop...---Lyrics submitted by Dylan.
