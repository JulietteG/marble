A thousand times fail 
Still your mercy remains
Should I stumble again
Still I'm calling your grace
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ended your glory goes beyond all things

Your will above all else, my purpose remians
the art of loosing myself, in bringing you praise
Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ended your glory goes beyond all things

My heart and my soul, I give you control
consume me from the inside out
Let justise and praise become my embrace
To love you from the inside out

Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ended your glory goes beyond all things
and the cry of my heart is to give praise from the inside out
oh my soul cries out

My heart and my soul, I give you control
Consume me from the inside out
let justise and praise become my embrace
To love you from the inside out

Everlasting, your light will shine when all else fades
Never ended your glory goes beyond all things
and the cry of my heart is to give you praise from the inside out
oh my soul cries out

Repeat x 2

Oh my soul cries out
oh my soul cries out---Lyrics submitted by Kate Lynn Purdy.
