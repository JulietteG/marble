Another melody another empty song
I tell myself that I have praised you
I try and make believe that this is all you want
But once again I know Ive missed it
 Praising you, not just the songs I sing
 Jesus, here I am- take everything

Take the pain inside
 Take the brokenness
Dont stop till theres nothing left
My arrogance, my pride
The loss of innocence
Jesus, take everything

Another melody another empty song
I tell myself that I have praised you
I try and make believe that this is all you want
But once again I know Ive missed it
 Praising you, not just the songs I sing
 Jesus, here I am- take everything

 Take the pain inside
 Take the brokenness
Dont stop till theres nothing left
My arrogance my pride
The loss of innocence
Jesus, take everything

Theres nothing left of me
Thats when I feel alive
Oh Holy Spirit fall fresh upon me
You can have it all

Take the pain inside
 Take the brokenness
Dont stop till theres nothing left
My arrogance my pride
The loss of innocence
Jesus, take everything 
(repeat )

Jesus take everything
