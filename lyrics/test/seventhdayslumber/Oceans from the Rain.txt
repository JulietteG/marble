And I'm amazed by you
Cause you're never far away
And all I've been through
You're love has never changed

You make oceans from the rain
Breathing life into this place
And I will drown inside your love
Until I see your perfect face

And nothing I've acquired
Means anything at all
Cause you're everything I needed
You're so much more than I deserve

you make oceans from the rain
breathing life into this place
and i will drown inside your love
until i see your perfect face

and i thank you lord
well i thank you lord
and i thank you lord
and i thank you lord

you make oceans from the rain
breathing life into this place
and i will drown inside your love
until i see your perfect face


you make oceans from the rain
breathing life into this place
and i will drown inside your love
until i see your perfect face

you make oceans from the rain(x3)

blood of jesus can wash your pain away---Lyrics submitted by carly.
