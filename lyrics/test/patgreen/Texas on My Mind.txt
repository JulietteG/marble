I woke up this morning,
Texas on my mind.
Thinking about my friends there,
And a girl Id left behind
The way she held me when we kissed,
The loving that wed done.
And how I left her waving good-bye
Standing in a Texas sun.

Chorus:
I got a half a mind to call her,
Half a mind to go 
Jump on a big jet liner
Wing it on my way back home.

And all the morning it was raining,
On the streets of Liverpool.
So I stayed in and played guitar,
And sang the lovesick blues.
My mind kept going back in time
When we both had fun
And how I left her waving to me,
Standing in the Texas sun.

Chorus

In my dreams shes still in love with me.
But Id have to travel home to see,
If shes found another man to take the place of me.
Guess Ill have to keep on dreamin sunny memories.

Wishin I was back there, doesnt help me much at all.
And when I want to hold her, it doesnt help me much to call
Stuck here in this seaport town, longing for the one.
That I left behind me there, standin in a Texas sun.
