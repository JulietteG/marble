Is anybody out there [repeat 4x]


Oh, so crazy 
Martians invading
We're on the moon, whoa, whoa
It's astrologic, meteors droppin' 
Whoa, yeah

It's like a rocket, rocket
You can't stop it, stop it
Once we blast off
We're on a lunar mission
This isn't science fiction
Leave your troubles on earth, take my hand

[Chorus]
We're gonna escape
We're defying gravity
Somewhere in the galaxy
There's a party on the moon and you're invited
Bring your friends too, it's so exciting
We're defying gravity
Somewhere in the galaxy
There's a party on the moon and you're invited
Bring your friends too, it's so exciting
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Party on the moon 

Is anybody out there
Is anybody out there

Oh, star chasin'
Thruster's a blazin'
We're on the moon, whoa, whoa
I see milky way hotties, so beam me up scottie
Whoa, yeah

It's like a rocket, rocket
You can't stop it, stop it
Once we blast off
Houston we're havin' problems
And I know how to solve 'em
Just leave your troubles on earth, take my hand

[Chorus 2]
We're getting away
We're defying gravity
Somewhere in the galaxy
There's a party on the moon and you're invited
Bring your friends too,  it's so exciting
We're defying gravity
Somewhere in the galaxy
There's a party on the moon and you're invited
Bring your friends too, it's so exciting
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Party on the moon

Intergalactic, whoa
Time is elastic and everyone knows it
When your world is static
Leave your troubles on earth take my hand
We're gonna escape...

[Chorus 2x]

Yeah, yeah yeah
Party on the moon

Is anybody out there (anybody)
