Its got to be real
Girl I could write a book on how you makin me feel
I know Ill never find
Another who could match the love you givin to me So

Chorus
This is, for the lover in you
This ring, means Ill always be true
This is, how well start love anew
This time, its gonna last forever

And girl youre not the kind a guy could easily charm
Cause Im in need of love
Its always shown to me when you are wrapped in my arms, oh baby
