It's beginning to look a lot like christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten
Glistening once again
Candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistor that shoots,
Is the wish of Barney and Ben.
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk,
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the grand hotel,
one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Ohh ...

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistor that shoots,
Is the wish of Barney and Ben.
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk,
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
