Don't ever say you're lonely
Just lay your problems on me
And I'll be waiting there for you
The stars can be so blinding
When you get tired of fighting
You know the one you can look to

When the vision you have gets blurry
You don't have to worry,
I'll be your eyes
It's the least I can do,
'Cause when I fell, you pulled me through

So you'll know that
Ill carry you, Ill carry you, Ill carry you
So you'll know that
Ill carry you, Ill carry you, Ill carry you

I know it's been a long night, but now I'm here it's alright
I've don't mind walking in your shoes
We'll take each step together, 'til you come back to center
You know that I know the real you

And when the vision you have gets blurry
You don't have to worry,
I'll be your eyes
That's the least I can do,
'Cause when I fell, you pulled me through

So you'll know that
Ill carry you, Ill carry you, Ill carry you
So you'll know that
Ill carry you, Ill carry you, Ill carry you

Like youve been running for hours and cant catch your breath
The demons are screaming so loud in your head
Youre tired, youre broken, youre cut and youre bruised
But nothings too heavy  just hold on, Ill carry you

Ill carry you

[Instrumental]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [4x]

So you'll know that
Ill carry you, Ill carry you, Ill carry you
So you'll know that
Ill carry you, Ill carry you, Ill carry you

So you'll know that
Ill carry you, Ill carry you, Ill carry you
So you'll know that
Ill carry you, Ill carry you, Ill carry you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
