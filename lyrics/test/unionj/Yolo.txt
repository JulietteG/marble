You only see the sun rise
When you stay up all night
Hey, hey
You only open those eyes
When you know it feels right

So chose love
Who do you want?
Just you push self
The night was made for us

Let's come together
You only live once, remember
Let's come together
You only live once, remember

A little bit time never killed no one
So give me that night I've been dreaming of
Let's come together
You only live once,
You only live once, remember

You only burn the roof down
When you let it all out
Hey, hey
You know you're in a wild crowd
When your feet are off the ground

So chose love
Who do you want?
Just you push self
The night was made for us

Let's come together
You only live once, remember
Let's come together
You only live once, remember

A little bit time never killed no one
So give me that night I've been dreaming of
Let's come together
You only live once,
You only live once, remember
You only live once,
You only live once, remember

Why, oh I know, you only live once
Why, oh I know, you only live once
Why, oh I know, you only live once
Why, oh I know, you only live once
Let's come together
Let's come together
You only live once,
You only live once, remember
You only live once,
You only live once, remember---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
