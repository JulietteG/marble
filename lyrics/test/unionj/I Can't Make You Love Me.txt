[George] 
Turn down the lights 
Turn down the bed 
Turn down these voices 
Inside my head 

[Jaymi] 
Lay down with me 
Tell me no lies 
Just hold me close 
Don't patronize 
Don't patronize me 

[Josh] 
Cause I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel 
Something that it won't 
Here in the dark, in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart 
And I will feel the power but you won't 
No you won't 
Cause I can't make you love me 
Josh and Jaymi 
If you don't 

[George] 
I'll close my eyes 
Cause then I won't see 
The love you don't feel 
When you're holding with me 

[Jaymi] 
Morning will come 
And I'll do what's right 
Just give me till then 
To give up this fight 
And I will give up this fight 

[Josh with harmonies of the others] 
Cause I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel 
Something that it won't 
Here in the dark, in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart 
And I'll feel the power but you won't 
No you won't 
Cause I can't make you love me 
If you don't 

[George] 
Turn down the lights 
Turn down the bed 
Turn down these voices 

[Josh does the melody, Jaymi does the echos, George and JJ do the harmonies] 
Cause I can't make you love me if you don't 
You can't make your heart feel 
Something that it won't 
Here in the dark, in these final hours 
I will lay down my heart 
I'll feel the power but you won't 
No you won't 

[Jaymi] 
I can't make you love me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
