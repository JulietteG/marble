I don't ask for much- I really feel the cold inside the touch
Of every single playful story told, I am bold, and I know it
I came from a place I'd like to be at- tasting every day
A little bit of sun that sets and sees, oh, everything around it

And there is a reflection that I know
And there is no presence in the gold
Let the flame burn loud in your soul

I woke up today and felt the faintest little taste
Of a needed change in my home town, and it sounds like I like it
I live for the day, in a little bus is where I stay
And my message glows like love and wine doin' time for the runnin'

And there is a reflection that I know
And there is no presence in the gold
Let the flame burn loud in your soul

And I won't listen to all the ones who say
I'm troubled and say I'm broken down
And I won't listen to all the ones who told me stories, told me I was loud
I'm about to break on through
I'm about to break on through
I'm about to break on through
And I can feel it, I can feel it- oh

Rain came today and every drop that fell upon my face
Was a million people in my mind, and I sighed, I'm above it
High waters high and broken crooked kind of smile
I am living with the sun that shines, I'm alive and I love it!

And there is a reflection that I know
And there is no presence in the gold
Let the flame burn loud in your soul

I'm about to break on through
I'm about to break on through
I'm about to break on through
And I can feel it, I can feel it- oh
I'm about to break on through
I'm about to break on through
I'm about to break on through
Yeah!
