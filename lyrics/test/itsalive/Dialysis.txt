I'm breathing, guess I'm still alive
But I'm sinking in your eyes tonight
I'm shaking, cause I miss the high
I'm regretting that we let this feeling die

Well if I could change my ways, I would
You know that I'd stop these thoughts if I could
But what makes matter worse, I'm missing you more
I filtered you out, cutting the cord

Dialysis is goodbye

I'm dozing, cause I had you in a dream
Now I'm craving you in my blood steam
Maybe if I keep real still
You might see me when you look for something real

Well if I could change my ways, I would
You know that I'd stop these thoughts if I could
But what makes matter worse, I'm missing you more
I filtered you out, cutting the cord

Well what's it gonna take to get you out of my blood?
I'd do anything, I'd do anything
And what's it gonna take to get you out of my head?

Well if I could change my ways, I would
You know that I'd stop these thoughts if I could
If I could change my ways, I would
You know that I'd stop these thoughts if I could
But what makes matter worse, I'm missing you more
I filtered you out, cutting the cord

Dialysis is goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Ashy.
