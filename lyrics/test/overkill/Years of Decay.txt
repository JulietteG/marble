OUT ON THIS ROAD TAKES ITS TOLL
AND YOU PAY FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO.
UNDER LIGHTS, MADE ME BLIND
THIS PLACE IS THE SAME AS LAST NIGHT...

OUT OF CONTROL, TAKES ITS TOLL
BUT YOU LEARN TO LIVE WITH YOUR DREAMS
SPEAKING YOUR MIND TO THOSE YOU FIND
LISTENING TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
I WOULDNT CHANGE THE WAY
I WOULDNT STOP THE DECAY.

PROMISED, THE WORLD AS YOUR WORLD
CHANGED BEFORE OUR EYES
AND THE DAYS BECAME THE WEEKS
AND THE WEEKS THE YEARS..
AND NO ONE REMEBERS THAT VERY FIRST DAY
OR HOW IT SLIPPED AWAY

FOR EVER, I WAIT PULLING IN, PUTTING OUT
AS THE MOTORS WHINE
TO REMIND ME IM HOME
AND I M HERE TO STAY
AS WE DECAY
ANOTHER DAY
DECAY AWAY


I M GOING HOME, I DONT KNOW WHERE
I M GOING HOME, NOT FAR FROM HERE.
OUT OF THIS ROAD, PAYING THIS TOLL
MAKE ME WHOLE, SET THE STAGE
FILL IT WHIT ANGER, FILL IT WITH RAGE.
NO, I DONT KNOW WHAT IS TODAY
I KNOW IT FALLS INTO THE DAYS OF DECAY...

SELF-SACRIFICE, EVERY NIGHT
AND TOGETHER WE PAID A PRICE IN BLOOD
THAT SPILLED OUT THROUGHT THE YEARS
AND ANOTHER DAY PASSES AWAY
LOOK TO THE BLACK, DRAWN FARTHER BACK
LOOK TO EACH DAY, SEE THE DECAY
TIMES I VE HAD, GOOD AND BAD
WIN OR LOOSE, THIS IS WHAT I CHOOSE...---Lyrics submitted by Toro.
