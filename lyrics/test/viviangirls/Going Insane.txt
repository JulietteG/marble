I'm going insane,
going out of my mind.
Just so you know,
just so you know,
He's totally mine!
I have such a good time,
when i'm with him.
Just so you know,
just so you know,
I wanna win his heart!
Going out of my mind,
and i'm going insane,
just know,
just know,
that I don't have a brain.
And i'm totally lame,
to wait for him.
Just know,
just know,
I wanna win his heart!
Im going insane,
going out of my mind.
Just know,
just know,
that he's gonna be mine.
He looks totally fine when im with him.
Just know,
just know,
that im gonna win his heart!---Lyrics submitted by Celeste.
