So tall and slender
Daddy was a charmer
He was a handsome man
But when he'd move it 
Lord the ladies lose it
Daddy was a dancin' man
When he was dancing
Daddy swept the floor
He called it siftin' sand
So light and graceful
Not a step was wasteful
Daddy was a dancin' man

And when the young men
They'd come a-courtin'
They'd try to take my hand
They'd buck and wing
But it didn't mean a thing
'cause Daddy was the dancin' man

So tall and slender
Daddy was a charmer
He was a handsome man
But when he'd move it
Lord the ladies lose it
Daddy was a dancin' man---Lyrics submitted by Mabel Paul.
