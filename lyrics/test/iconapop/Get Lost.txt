I woke up this morning
Blurry eye
Ive been working so hard staying alive
Well, I dont need this shit
No I wont be long
Before I take that money
Money and run
Im gonna take that money, money and run

Lets get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
Fucked up world behind
Lets get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
Fucked up world behind

I woke up this morning
So destroyed
Ive been down in my luck
Just feeling a void
Well, I dont need this shit
No I wont belong
Before I take that money
Money and run
Im gonna take that money, money and run

Lets get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
Fucked up world behind
Lets get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
Fucked up world behind

Lets get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
Fucked up world behind
Lets get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
Fucked up world behind ---
