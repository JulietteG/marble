We always dreamed about this better life, this better life
We always thought we'd come in all along, yeah all along
We got the kiss, and walked through paradise, yeah paradise
Now let's go walking hand in hand

Come on baby we can hit the lights
Make the rooms go right
We can smash the floor, make the pop go raw
We're the love mystique, we don't need no sleep
And it feels like we could do this all night
We could do this all night
Yeah everything is alright

We got the kiss, and walked through paradise, yeah paradise
It feels like... we could do this all night

[Beat break]

(We could do this all night)

Oh when the men under the summer skies, the summer skies
The seasons changed, our house will stay the same, yeah stay the same
We got that burning feeling, start a fire, start a fire
Giving a shout, let's make it hot

Come on baby we can hit the lights
Make the rooms go right
We can smash the floor, make the pop go raw
We're the love mystique, we don't need no sleep
And it feels like we could do this all night
We could do this all night
Yeah everything is alright

We got the kiss, and walked through paradise, yeah paradise
It feels like... we could do this all night

Feels like... we could do this all night

All night, all night, all night, all night

Come on baby we can hit the lights
Make the rooms go right
We can smash the floor, make the pop go raw
We're the love mystique, we don't need no sleep
And it feels like... we could do this all night
We could do this all night
We could do this all night
Yeah everything is alright ---
