They say you're a freak when we're having fun
Say you must be high when we're spreading love
But it's living life and we never stop
We got the world
We got the wo-wo-wo-wo-wo...world

We can live fast, fly young
Everyday we celebrate just like we want
Only you and I, DIY
We found a way to live the dream until we die

Just come into my arms
I will get you love drunk
We'll be burning bright
Us against the world tonight

They say you're a freak when we're having fun
Say you must be high when we're spreading love
But we're just living life and we never stop
We got the world
We got the wo-wo-wo-wo-wo...world

Black shades, bright nights
Back to back we'll do this 'til the end of time
You and I live, don't learn
Everyday we fire it up then let it burn

Just come into my arms
I will get you love drunk
We'll be burning bright
Us against the world tonight

They say you're a freak when we're having fun
Say you must be high when we're spreading love
But we're just living life and we never stop
We got the world
We got the wo-wo-wo-wo-wo...world

They say you're a freak when we're having fun
Say you must be high when we're spreading love
But we're just living life and we never stop
We got the world
We got the world
We got the world---Lyrics submitted by Chris A.
