I got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge 
I watched I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs

I crashed my car into the bridge
I don't care
I love it
I don't care

I got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge
I watched I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs

I crashed my car into the bridge
I don't care
I love it
I don't care

You're on a different road 
I'm in the milky way
You want me down on earth 
But I am up in space

You're so damn hard to please
We gotta kill this switch
You're from the 70s but I'm a 90s bitch

I love it
I love it

I got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge 
I watched i let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge

I don't care, I love it
I love it, I don't care
I love it
I don't care

You're on a different road
I'm in the milky way
You want me down on earth
But I'm up in space

You're so damn hard to please
We gotta kill this switch
You' re from the 70s but I'm a 90s bitch

I don't care, I love it
I don't care, I love it
I love it, I don't care
I love it, I love it
I don't care

I love it---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
