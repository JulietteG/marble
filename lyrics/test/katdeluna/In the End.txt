I'm the textbook definition of a rebel
I see the crumble over left and I've got go right
I'm always in some trouble
To me life ain't fun unless you're in a good fight

So the more you're good to me
The more I try to get you to leave

[CHORUS]
All my life I've made excuses
Pushing you away, saying that you're not for me
All my life...
I tried everything
In the end it was you
In the end, in the end it was you

All I wanna do is have a good time
Let the beat go through me and just take me away
You've been trying to get with me for a while
And I've been telling you to save that for another day

So the more you're good to me
The more I try to get you to leave

[CHORUS]
All my life I've made excuses
Pushing you away, saying that you're not for me
All my life...
I tried everything

In the end it was you
In the end, in the end it was you

No no no
I never would've thought
You'd be the one
That I'd be with in the end
Baby
I never would've dreamed
That you and me
Were be together in the end
(2X)

[CHORUS]
All my life I've made excuses
Pushing you away, saying that you're not for me
All my life...
I tried everything
In the end it was you
In the end, in the end it was you

[CHORUS]
All my life I've made excuses
Pushing you away, saying that you're not for me
All my life...
I tried everything
In the end it was you
In the end, in the end it was you---Lyrics submitted by Agnes.
