The rich man lived in luxury surrounded by his door
He always had the very best that money could afford
He left this world not caring about his resting place
He laid his eyes toward Heaven, but it was too late

CHORUS:
Give me one drop of water, the rich man cried from Hell
One drop of water, but still no water felt
He always was a selfish man, his heart was filled with greed
Now a little drop of water is all he'll ever need

You can't love gold and silver and love the Savior too
Like the eye of the needing no chance of getting through
So make your reservation before another day
For all your gold and silver will surely pass away

CHORUS:
Give me one drop of water, the rich man cried from Hell
One drop of water, but still no water felt
He always was a selfish man, his heart was filled with greed
Now a little drop of water is all he'll ever need

There's one way to Heaven, its by amazing grace
Where everyone is equal no matter creed or race
So have no other Bible, and always put God first
We'll live on milk and honey, and we will never thirst

CHORUS:
Give me one drop of water, the rich man cried from Hell
One drop of water, but still no water felt
He always was a selfish man, his heart was filled with greed
Now a little drop of water is all he'll ever need

Now a little drop of water is all he'll ever need---Lyrics submitted by Halie Sullivan.
