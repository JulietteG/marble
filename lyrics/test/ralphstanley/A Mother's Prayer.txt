Momma would pray, at night by her bedside
She call out to Jesus, in a voice so sincere
Watch over my children, and show them your mercy
Don't let 'em be alone, in this old world down here

A mother's pray, more precious than diamonds
A mother's pray, more precious than gold
There's nothing on earth that could compare,  
I can still see her kneeling there
Thank God for the power, of a mother's prayer

With tears in my eyes, in the darkest of hours
I cried alone, don't take her from me
Since she took my hand, said son I'm ready
Said the sweetest prayer, then she went off to sleep

Chorus:

Then I had a dream, I stood before Jesus
Saw the Book of Life, and my name was in there
Lord I done so much wrong, and I don't deserve mercy
Said there's something about, your mother's prayer

Chorus : 

repeat the last line ...... and end---Lyrics submitted by Darrell Lawrence.
