Far away there's a land where there'll be no more heartaches,
All the pain will be gone over there.
And with the Lord I'll be livin' upon the streets of glory,
Far away from the old troublesome world.

Men that's borned of a woman are but few days and full of trouble,
Like a flower that is withered and gone a away.
I have known so many heartaches while on this earth I've been livin',
But the Lord has made a perfect place for me.

I have tasted the teardrops that spill on my pillow,
I have tasted the goodness of the Lord.
And I long for the day when He calls me to meet him
far away from this old troublesome world.---Lyrics submitted by tony delmedico.
