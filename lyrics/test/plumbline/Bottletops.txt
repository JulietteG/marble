Billy is bartering bottletops
Suzie is selling her soul
Tied up and twisted and all of my mystics can't steal the grace that I hold
Such a long way down
Such a long yeah-ah

I wanna go to Miami
And leave behind my world
And ignore all the prices of these sacrifices and void all the debts I've incurred
Cuz it's such a long way down
It's such a long way down to the ground

Where can I go tonight
What can I do to show her the least bit of love 
((MY INTERPRETATION) Sounds like "shower the least bit of light," which doesn't really make sense)
Why do I need to change

Well baby sing me a story
And sooth my mind
Don't talk of war, the weary, the poor, but speak of this love one more time
Cuz I'm lavished by loved ones
And I listen to friends
My mercy's been spent on the bi-weekly rent of the company I'm comfortable in
Cuz it's such a long way down
It's such a long way down 
It's such a long way down
It's such a long (long way down)

And where can I go tonight
What can I do to show her the least bit of love
Why do I need (I need a change) a change this time
Isn't there someone who loves more than I

And I try out on the boulevard
And tonight I'm not very far, yeah
But I'll talk to you like you're not here
And I'll say the words that you want to hear
Cuz it's such a long way down
Yeah, it's such a long way down
And it's such a long way down (long way down)
And it's such a long way down (long way down)
It's such a long way down (long way down)
It's such a long (long way down)
Yeah-e-ah-e-ah
Yeah-e-ah-e-ah
Yeah-e-ah-e-ah
To the ground

Ba-dum ba-dum
Da-da-da-da-dum-dae-da-dum-da-da-dum
Mmm-m-mm mmhmm
Yeah-eah
Oh-oh-ah
Da-da-dum-da-da-dum-da-dum-dum-dum-dum
Bidi-bum-bidi-bum-bum-bum-bidi-bum-yea...---Lyrics submitted by Eric.
