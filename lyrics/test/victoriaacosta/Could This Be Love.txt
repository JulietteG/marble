Woke up his morning,
just sat in my bed,
8 a.m first thing in my
head, is a certain
someone, who's
always on my mind

He treats me like a lady in
everyway, he smiles and
warms me through up the
day
should i tell him i love you,
wish i knew what to say!

Could thIs be love that
i feel, so strong, so
deep and so real,
if i lost you would i
ever heal, could this
be love that i feel? (2x)

the wayhe looks, 
so deep in my eyes,
our hearts are so
warm, i just wanna cry

then he's so
hardworking,
he wants to be someone.

should i tell him that i
love you, what if he
doesn't say it too,
(say it too)
im feeling so nervous,
what should i do

could this be love that
i feel, so strong, so
deep and so real,
if i lost you would i
ever heal, could this
be love taht i feel? (2x)

wiil this be my turn, 
two hearts beating
together as one,
no more loneliness
only love, laughter and fun

could this be love that i
feel, so strong, so
deep and so real
if i lost you would
i ever heal
could this be love that i feel?

could this be love that i
feel, so strong, so
deep and so real
if i lost you would i
ever heal, could this be love taht i feel?

could this be love taht i feel?...---Lyrics submitted by joyce.
