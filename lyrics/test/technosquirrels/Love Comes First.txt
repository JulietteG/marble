Shouldn't we be in a hurry if we really wanted this, isn't it enough already knowing that we tried our best.

Maybe we can call it even, sorry that I never left, tell me if you'd still forgive me tell me if you'd still come in.

Love comes first, faster than it should.
Love comes first, it leaves such a ....
Love comes first, then we realize, 
Love comes first.

Sitting here with all the answers, did you think we'd make it last?
Rushing into arms wide open, wishing we could call it home.

Tell me (x8)

Love comes first, faster than it should.
Love comes first, it leaves such a ....
Love comes first, then we realize, 
Love comes first.---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
