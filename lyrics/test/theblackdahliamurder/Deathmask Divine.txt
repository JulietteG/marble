Removal of the eyes gives my heart a saddened chill
I preserve them in formaldehyde
to gaze upon at will
how their greenish flecks befill me
that starlit winters night
how I lost all that I ever was
while locked within their sight
before you sits a broken man
your fragile pinkish heart in hand
peculiar how it can hurt so bad
while love is only in the mind
I sew the gaping chestwork
each thread is made with love
the bosom where I would rest my face
is covered in your blood
no
this is not the end
you'll live on eternally
oh
lord its not the end
my secret you'll forever be
I interrupt this transformation
a familiar lust swelling in me
a long and soulful kiss
the shades are drawn the living world cant see
the coil of entrails
how curious the smell
so pungent to my eager nostrils
hands further compelled
no
no its not the end
forever you'll be in my arms
I could never let you go
my darling cold and blue
I wonder are you dreaming still
spread eagle blood removed
I weave the sucking trocar
beneath your bruising skin
tonight I'll lay beside you darling in necromantic sin
pinned to the bed sheets like a prized butterfly
you're mine
I hear your voice so precious echoing deeply inside
I did my best to love you
while you did live and breathe
this tender taxidermy
trophy of the bereaved ---Lyrics submitted by Colin Rae Ensor.
