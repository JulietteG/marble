We bear the bloodline of the conqueror
Behold this war-scarred coat of arms
Weathered and worn are we
But with an eye ajar we sleep with blade in hand
We're waiting for the call

Join us! Black valor's on our side
Striking with satanic force we'll crust their fabled Christ

Decimated by a whirlwind of insufferable attacks
Impenetratable black phalanx of our unblessed spear and shield
We march upon the enemy with hate, with hate
On this day of victory christian blood will soak these battlefields

The tidings of a war infernal
Destruction of all angelic life
To bear the mark of the pentagram circle reviled

Armageddon's drawing nearer
On the coattails of the end we'll ride
Of death we hath no fear,
Hails! black valor's on our side!
Boundless is unholiness iniquitous our pride
Each man a god unto himself spirit never to die

To the almighty one, unholy bearer of horns
Empower me, flow through my veins
And carry me in war
To the unwavering devoted to the dark
I drink these wines on majesty to you

Do you show the standard of sixhundred sixty sixth
Will your flesh withstand the dawning of apocalypse
Does your will it guide the spear that pierced the martyr's ribs
We will not rest till this rotten planet's black - as pitch

The tidings of a war infernal
Destruction of all angelic life
To bear the mark of the pentagram circle reviled

Brothers! black valor's on our side!
Striking with satanic force we'll crush their fabled Christ
Unhallowed Armageddon's drawing near
Boundless is unholiness of death we hath no fear---Lyrics submitted by Jonas.
