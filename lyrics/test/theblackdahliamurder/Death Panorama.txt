In that very moment which life doth fade away
Ejected from my human shell exempt from time or space
Floating absorbing omniscient in display
A grandiose presentation unravels before me

Not in chronology but so wildly all at once
An open dioramic rendition of events
Some horrible integral just the same a
Ll pieces are key to the sum of the being
A strobe of emotions vivid extreme
The rapturous voyage through life's victories
The man that I once was I have left him behind

What kind of man does the assembled puzzle read
With soul spread open wide I calmly contemplate my destiny

Death panorama, death panorama

Not in chronology but so wildly all at once
An open dioramic rendition of events
Some horrible integral just the same
All pieces are key to the sum of the being
A strobe of emotions vivid extreme
The rapturous voyage through life's victories
The man that I once was
I have left him behind---Lyrics submitted by Adam.
