Waves of reality
Lifting me unexpectedly
Looking inside to see
Visions of you and me

Confide my heart to you
Blindly erase my every doubt
Surrender myself to you
For passion Ive lived without

C/o

Rain...
In a mystery
Waking all of my dreams suddenly
Oh rain...
Tears of ecstacy
Falling into the arms that they say Id strayed

Helplessly falling again
Carelessly give my heart away
Unlucky yes I have been
Cause love just never stays

Is a heart made to break
Is there in love an addiction
I dont know how long it takes
Before another burn

Rain..
In a mystery
Waking all of my dreams suddenly
Oh rain...
Tears of ecstasy
Falling into the arms that they say Id strayed
Rain down on me
Gently take me to where I should be
Oh rain...
Tears of ecstacy
Falling into the arms that they say Id strayed---Lyrics submitted by gie.
