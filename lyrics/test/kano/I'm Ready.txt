We came into your world not knowing what to do
You woke us up at dawn just to dance all over space
Yeah baby, yeah baby, I come to dance with you
Yeah baby, yeah baby, are you ready?

You told us to go up and computers came to stay
You woke us up at day just to dance all over space
Yeah baby, yeah baby, I come to dance with you
Yeah baby, yeah baby, are you ready?---Lyrics submitted by joan salyer.
