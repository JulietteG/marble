You're the angel in my pocket
You're that whisper in my head
You're the perfure on my dirty shirt
The favorite words I've ever said
You're the edge I just stepped off of
You're the sunlight through my window pane
You're the road I wanna break down on, in the pourin rain

'Cause I know I'm not easy to hold
But you've reached me, baby
You saved me from me before I was too far gone
Girl, I love you for taking me on

I spent my life just spinnin my wheeles
But I wasn't gettin no where fast
You took my foot off the gas
You brought me miles from where you found me
And now I ain't goin back

'Cause I know I'm not easy to hold
But you've reached me, baby
You saved me from me before I was too far gone
Girl, I love you for taking me on

I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was wreakless and helpless and hurting
You were strong enough to carry me all the way

'Cause I know I'm not easy to hold
But you've reached me, baby
You saved me from me before I was too far gone
Girl, I love you for taking me on

I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was wreakless and helpless and hurting
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was wreakless and helpless and hurting
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was wreakless and helpless and hurting
I was lost, I was wrong, I was searching
I was wreakless and helpless and hurting---Lyrics submitted by Alicia.
