Burn the Pictures, 
Throw away the letters I wrote,
It's time to face it I'm nothing but, a dead end road, 
Your only mad cause you know he's right, 
For once in you life little girl you better listen to your daddy,

He knows what He's talkin about,
Girl I'm no good, 
I'll only break your heart,
Your never gonna settle me down, 
He's a good man,
And it's his job to be lookin out for his baby,
This one time youo need to listen to your daddy,

Girl you know it,
He never liked me from the start, 
My rebel family,
My dreaming on a beat car,
Maybe I'm who he use to be,
And he knows where this is gonna lead,
You need to listen to your daddy,

He knows what he's talkin about,
Girl I'm no good,
I'll only break your heart,
You never gonna settle me down,

He's a good man,
And it's his job,
To be lookin out for his baby,
This one time you need to listen to your daddy,
He's a good man,
It's his job to be lookin out for his baby,
This is one time you need ta listen, listen, listen to your daddy.---Lyrics submitted by Shay.
