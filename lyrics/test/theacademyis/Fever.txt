Lies are lies in everybodys eyes and I dont believe you

When the summer is gone, it wont be long till someones got the fever creeping inside
when the city is moving and your eyes are a moving and you just cant fight that feeling but you said it for the last time

Lies are lies in everybodys eyes and I dont believe you
lies are lies in everybodys eyes and I dont believe you
lies are lies in everybodys eyes and lies are lies
cant fight it, no, I just cant fight it
cant fight it, no, I just cant fight it now

When the summer is gone, it wont be long till someone's got the fever creeping inside (Oh, oh)
when the city is moving and your eyes are a moving and you just cant stop, you just cant fight it
this is the last time

Lies are lies in everybodys eyes and I dont believe you
lies are lies in everybodys eyes and I dont believe you
lies are lies in everybodys eyes and lies are lies
cant fight it, no, I just cant fight it
cant fight it, no, I just cant

Well, we all agree that we dont believe this is the last time, this is the last time
well, they promised you, now you seen the truth, this is the last time, this is the last time
this is the last time and every one has got the fever 

Lies are lies, lies are lies
lies are lies, lies are lies
lies are lies, lies are lies
lies are lies in everybodys eyes

Lies are lies in everybodys eyes and I dont believe you
lies are lies in everybodys eyes and I dont believe you
lies are lies in everybodys eyes and lies are lies
cant fight it, no, I just cant fight it
cant fight it, no, I just cant

Well, we all agree that we dont believe, this is the last time, this is the last time
well, they promised you, now you seen the truth, this is the last time, this is the last time
this is the last time, this is the last time
this is the last time

When the summer is gone it wont be long till someones got the fever---Lyrics submitted by Estefania.
