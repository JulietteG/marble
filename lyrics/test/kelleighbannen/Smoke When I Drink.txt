And feels good, right now
And I'm too lit up
To try and turn him down
All that hope back gone in a blank
Keep telling myself
I only smoke when I drink

You know me, but I been lying
Say that I don't need a desert island
Quarantine to ween me off of you
Only thing that works is staying sober
And that ship sailed a couple times over
Now you're walking over right on cue

Baby, you're a cigarette
Straight to my head
I'm high as a cat while I'm staying out

Only smoke when I drink
Only smoke when I drink
Straight bourbon, keep 'em coming
Baby, what do you think?

And feels good, right now
And I'm too lit up
To try and turn him down
All that hope back gone in a blank
Keep telling myself
I only smoke when I drink

Tomorrow I'll be waking up
Wondering what I was thinking last night
But tonight I'm staying up

Only smoke when I drink
Only smoke when I drink
Straight bourbon, keep 'em coming
Baby, what do you think?---
