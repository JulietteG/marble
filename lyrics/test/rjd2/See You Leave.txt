RAP 1: STS
ok
break up break up tempo
someone adjust my levels
this don't sound like heaven
you must be cool with the devil
I got this chick from vegas bitch
runnin around with them rebels
swears she really gets me
but the boost is in the shovel
shortys smooth as pedal
one hard as heavy metal
the way she wrap my dick
you'd think my shit came with some pedals Uh uh
she tells me ain't no one better uh
STS she only knows me by them letters uh
thats rock in roll shit
I must think i'm eddie vedder
I know she fuck with other niggers
I don't sweat her
she said she'd only fuck with me if i would let her
I ain't no hater honey go and get yo chedder uh uh
that type of shit just gets her wetter uh uh
she just hope i don't forget her uh uh
I told that bitch "bitch i would never" uh 
man i haven't seen that bitch in for forevers uh uh

3 layers of vocals hard to keep track
