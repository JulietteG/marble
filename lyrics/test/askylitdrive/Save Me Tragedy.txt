I hear you

I fell in love with the fame and greed
I fell before but not quite this deep
Somebody save me from 
The terror I've become
And when my conscience is clear
I will not bite my tongue

It's only a minute more

I hear you screaming
Put down the gun
These days I'm better off another casualty
I know you're thinking this blade's the one
But this is not your time to leave
I hear you screaming

You fell in love with a tragedy
Yeah you're just like me
So come on come on come on
This bullet is a curse
What is your fate now worth
I know it seems like forever

It's only a minute more

I hear you screaming
Put down the gun
These days I'm better off another casualty
I know you're thinking this blade's the one
But this is not your time to leave
I hear you screaming

Don't lose faith
Faith in me
Save me from tragedy

It's only a minute more

I hear you screaming
Put down the gun
These days I'm better off another casualty
I know you're thinking this blade's the one
But this is not your time to leave
I hear you screaming

Don't lose faith in me
I know just what you're thinking
But I won't let you leave
Save me tragedy
I know I won't be better off a casualty
I hear you scream
