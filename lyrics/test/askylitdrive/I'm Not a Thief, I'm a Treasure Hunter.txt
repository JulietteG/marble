The skin around your mouth
The touch of your lips don't mean as much to me as this
I've never felt so alive until I figured you out

Your words are infectious
Your eyes leave me breathless
I think it's safe to say you're deadly in your own way
I've never felt so alive until I figured you out

I've got the moves to make you move
The thorn in my side just may be you
I know you know what's going on
I know you know what's going on girl
This is me without you

Breathe easy
The doctors are about to arrive
Just try to run
You can't escape me
This is the last for me

What's it like in the greater sky?

I've got the moves to make you move
The thorn in my side just may be you
I know you know what's going on
I know you know what's going on girl
This is me without you

Breathe easy
The doctors are about to arrive
Tell me what's it like
Breathe easy
The doctors are about to arrive
What a passive thought when the truth is that I've taken your life
Breathe easy
The doctors are about to arrive
Now I'm alive---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
