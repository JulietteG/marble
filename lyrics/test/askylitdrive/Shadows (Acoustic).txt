I am alone
You have betrayed me
Run from the shadows of your apathy
I feel alive
Now it's your time to beg for your life
So beg
Beg for your life
Beg
Beg for your life

So wake me, wake me when you're ready to go
We don't have time to take this slow
You make me, make me wanna lose control
And there's one thing you ought to know
That it's such a shame
I'd rather die than it be this way
But if one of us has to go just know I will dig your grave
I am the end
Look what you've made me
I run the shadows
They belong to me
Nowhere to hide
Now it's your time to beg for your life

So beg
Beg for your life
Why don't you beg?
Beg for your life
So wake me, wake me when you're ready to go
We don't have time to take this slow
You make me, make me wanna lose control
And there's one thing you ought to know
That it's such a shame
I'd rather die than it be this way
But if one of us has to go just know I will dig your grave---
