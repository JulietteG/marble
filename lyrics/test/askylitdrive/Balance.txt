Our differences set us apart... they can't bind me
Our hearts have been equivalent from the start... if only
I spoke these words at the right time
At a loss for words to build the right line

Reflect a traitor to make my mind cry open
Behave ... like gentlemen ... like proper men we dive in
Live... you'll be the proof of my existence
My pride my dreams
They all belong just to me

So alive we coexist .. so envious .. we pray for this

Listen to my story .. this may be our last chance
People die and people dance

Reflect a traitor to make my mind cry open
Behave ... like gentlemen ... like proper men we dive in
Live... you'll be the proof of my existence
My pride and dreams
They all belong just to me

So alive we coexist .. so envious .. we pray for this

Listen to my story .. this may be our last chance
People die and people dance---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
