Get me out! Get me out!
Heaven can't handle you quite like I do
Stay close I'm your protection
Get me out! Get me out!
Let me show you the life

I will come
Breathe tonight
I will come
I will....

Whether we live or die just remember I'll be alright on the other side
Whether we live or die just remember I'll love you forever

I've been waiting for you
Let us settle this here
As you open your eyes
Oblivion sets in
The revolution caved in

Rise! Up on your feet girl
The world awaits your smile

Whether we live or die just remember I'll be alright on the other side
Whether we live or die just remember I'll love you forever

Did you think you were better off this way?
Running off with all the things you said to me ---Lyrics submitted by Joe.
