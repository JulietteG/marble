Lie to me
I won't lie
Tape your mouth shut
Lie to me
I won't lie
Swallow your tongue

Forget it all I have you buried in my walls
Ill use your skin to cover up my scars

The place you lay in a bloody hall of fame
The ropes that tied your hands right by your side
[x2]

So now youre screaming at the top of your lungs
Hoping for someone to come
(for some, for some, for someone to come)
Hoping theyll bring a gun
To inflict all the pain
I caused upon you.
I caused upon you.

I wont die, I wont die, I will lie
The only problem with the story carved on your chest
Is its hard to read when youre missing your ribs

The place you lay in a bloody hall of fame
The ropes that tied your hands right by your side

So now youre screaming at the top of your lungs
Hoping for someone to come
(for some, for some, for someone to come)
Hoping theyll bring a gun
To inflict all the pain
I caused upon you.
I caused upon you.

I wont die, I wont die,
I wont die (I will lie)
I wont die (I will lie)
The only problem with the story carved on your chest
Is its hard to read when youre missing your ribs

So now youre screaming at the top of your lungs
Hoping for someone to come
(for some, for some, for someone to come)
Hoping theyll bring a gun
To inflict all the pain
I caused upon you.
I caused upon you.

So now youre screaming at the top of your lungs
Waiting for someone to come
(Waiting for someone)
Hoping theyll bring a gun
To inflict all the pain
I caused upon you.
I caused upon you.

Immerse me, cut my throat
Immerse me, cut my throat
If you want me skin deep you better act now.
If you want me skin deep you better act now.---Lyrics submitted by Cody.
