Baby cried the day the circus came to town
cause she didnt want parades just passing by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
And she danced without a net upon the wire
I know a lot about her cause you see
Baby is an awfull lot like me

We dont cry out loud,
We keep it inside
Learn how to hide our feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember we almost had it all

Baby saw that when they pulled the big top down
They left her dreams behind among the litter
And the different kind of love she thought shed found
It was nothing more than sawdust and some glitter
But baby cant be broken cause you see
She had the finest teacher, that was me

Don t cry out loud,
keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember we almost had it all

And if you should fall
Remember we almost had it all---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
