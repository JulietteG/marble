I'd rather leave while I'm in love
While I still believe the meaning of the word
I'll keep my dreams and just pretend
That you and I are never gonna end

Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken, usually it's mine
I don't want to take the chance of being hurt again
And you and I can't say good-bye

So if you wake and find me gone
Oh baby, carry on you see I need my fantasy
I still believe, it's best to leave while I'm in love

Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken, usually it's mine
I don't want to take the chance of being hurt again
You and I can't say good-bye

So if you wake and find me gone
Oh baby, carry on you see I need my fantasy
I still believe, it's best to leave while I'm in love
I still believe, it's best to leave while I'm in love---Lyrics submitted by Jim Faulk.
