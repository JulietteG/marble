I was born with wings yet I chose to crawl
Through my mind like a desert void of anything
Anything good at all
Now I hold my head up high
Hang the noose up on the wall
Love help me seeing the invisible
Compassion set me free

Just let go, just let go
Just let go, just let go

May I forgive myself for the person who I think I should be
And may I love myself even when it feels like I don't deserve to breathe

What you seek is seeking you
What you seek is seeking you
What you seek is seeking you
What you seek is seeking you

Just let go, just let go
Just let go, just let go
Just let go, just let go
Just let go, just let go

There is no agony like holding on to an untold story
Inside of you, poisoning the truth

Do you want to break the chains?
Do you want to break the chains?
Do you want to break the chains?
Do you want to break the chains?

Take refuge (Take refuge)
Take refuge (Take refuge)
Take refuge (Take refuge)
Take refuge---
