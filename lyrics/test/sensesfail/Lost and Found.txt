The silent have become
An ocean and my boat's too small
The waves are chrashing in
And I cant save this sinking ship


I sent out signal flares
But no one out there seems to care
Now the voice inside my head
Is the only thing that I have left

This is the part where I'll admit
I'm getting what I deserve 
And now,I'm lost at sea
I'm drowning in what I will be
I'm haunted by the sound
(sweet sound of my last breath)


20 days at sea
My skin is blistered from the heat
I can beg and I can plead
What I get is never what I need

This is the part where I'll admit 
I'm getting what I deserve
And now,I'm lost at sea
I'm drowning in what I will be 
I'm haunted by the sound
(sweet sound of my last breath)

And now,I'm lost at sea 
I'm drowning in what I will be 
I'm haunted by the sound
(sweet sound of my last breath)

A-whoa-oh-oh
A-whoa-whoa

I'm going down 
I'm going down
{x2}


This is the part where I'll admit 
I'm getting what I deserve
And now,I'm lost at sea
I'm drowning in what I will be
I'm Haunted by the sound
(sweet sound of my last breath)
