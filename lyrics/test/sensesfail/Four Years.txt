I take a shot of Jameson or Jack to start the morning off with old friends.
Ill celebrate like its the anniversary of the day that we first me.
Ive been practicing our eulogy, separated all our things,
I took my name off of the lease. Im leaving.

Dear, four years hurt less than five and its never a good time.
I am sorry for all my crimes and the wandering gaze of my unfaithful eyes.

Now I wonder as I am sliding under the subtle control of the drink,
If I have enough left in the bottle to say all the things Im thinking?
Ive been practicing my exit plan,
Nervously checking time,
I still dont know how I will survive.

Dear, four years hurt less than five and its never a good time.
I am sorry for all my crimes and the wandering gaze of my unfaithful eyes.
Its clear I am an awful mess but I had to get this off my chest.
Soon the only thing Ill have left is your memory and promises never kept.

When she came home I made her sit,
My feet tap out a rhythm as I draw breath in.
To hurt the only one Ive loved,
This is so damn hard but I am giving up,
The person that you love is dead, I flooded him out with the Jack and Jameson,
So happy anniversary. The best gift I could think to give you was to set you free.
Wake up youre sleeping
Wake up youre sleeping behind the wheel---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
