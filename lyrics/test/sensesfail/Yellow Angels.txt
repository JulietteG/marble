As the car begins to roll I smile as I lose control.
This weightlessness is such a gift cause gravity has lost its hold.
I see the sky and then the ground a kaleidoscope of light and sound.
Catching flashes of my life and just then the house lights all went out.
I want to know myself so bad it hurts but I am a shelf holding unread words.

Ive said goodbye so many times in my life I am surprised its still so hard for me.
To see that I should start living my life or I will die unfulfilled and empty.

I come to still in the chair as yellow angels step with care.
My spinal cord still sending shocks but my lifes in need of repair.
Theres got to be more than this.
I dont want to just exist as a hollow house for bones,
More alone every minute.
Is there a place where I can start again?

Ive said goodbye so many times in my life I am surprised its still so hard for me.
To see that I should start living my life or I will die unfulfilled and empty.

Wake up youre sleeping
Wake up youre sleeping behind the wheel
Wake up youre sleeping
Wake up youre sleeping behind the wheel
Wake up youre sleeping
Wake up youre sleeping behind the wheel---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
