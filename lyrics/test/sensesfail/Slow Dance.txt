f you pull too hard
Then the string will break.
And if you leave the slack
Then the string won't hold.

So how can we find ourselves
Trapped in our own private hells
Where we just scream but no one can hear
'X' marks the spot where the dig begins
The treasure is found within
The broken hearts that are soaked with fear.

Fill the glass to the brim
And it will spill out.
And keep on sharpening the knife,
And it will, it will be so blunt.

So how can we find ourselves
Trapped in our own private hells
Where we just scream but no one can hear
'X' marks the spot where the dig begins
The treasure is found within
The broken hearts that are soaked with fear.

To be at one with all your life

So how can we find ourselves
Trapped in our own private hells
Where we just scream but no one can hear

So how can we find ourselves (So be)
Trapped in our own private hells (at one)
Where we just scream but no one can hear (with all your life)
'X' marks the spot where the dig begins (And do)
The treasure is found within (without)
The broken hearts that are soaked with fear (doing a thing)

Don't try too hard to understand
Or you'll miss the, miss the point at hand.---Lyrics submitted by saf.
