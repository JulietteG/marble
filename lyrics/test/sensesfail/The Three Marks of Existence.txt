How does the rose open its heart and give the world its beauty?
It bathes in the light, the love of the sun encouraging its blooming
You be the ground where nothing is sown and plant the seeds of love to grow

Cultivate the change you seek
Love is not a song sung by the weak

When in the trap of doubt, remember its a cloud
This to shall pass and fade, impermanence to pain

What is the body but a shadow of a shadow of our love
In which the whole universe resides
There is only wind in that well
And there have always been keys in the cell
It takes compassion to confront your pain
It takes strength to be vulnerable enough to float on the rivers of shame
Be ground, be crumbled
You've been stoney for too long

Like wild flowers grow where you are
Let your heart burst, let it explode

Like wild flowers grow where you are
Let your heart burst, let it explode

Like wild flowers grow where you are
Let your heart burst, let it explode

Go---
