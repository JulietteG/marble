Fireworks at dawn as I sip for assistance
this flask keeps me calm it reflects back my bent image
of someone who's lost getting older by the minute
laugh lines are like growing scars someday they will be finished
I've got so many places that I want to see and I've got so many faces I want to be

so get on your feet wipe the dirt off and get with it
destiny waits at your door all wrapped up with a ribbon
it's time to move on because the past can't be your passion
so what if you did something wrong,
find someone who hasn't


I've got so many places that I want to see and I've got so many faces I want to be---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
