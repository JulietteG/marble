Last night I found heaven
It's on the tip of my tongue
And it reminded me of
All the times I was young

I've got you right in my view now
I used to smile till the day I fell down
I have no idea who the hell I've become
It's not who I was, it's not who I love

I want to drown, in a sea filled with Novocaine
I want to burn, on a beach where the sand
Has thousands of needles poking at my skin

I lie in bed to the sound, of the wolves at my door
They are speaking in tongues
While they claw at my floor

I never thought it would come to this
I'm more yellow than my own piss

they're making branches to even the score
Just open the door, just open the door

I want to drown, in a sea filled with Novocaine
I want to burn, on a beach where the sand
Is littered with razer blades
Littered with razer blades
Blades
Littered with razer blades

I can't hold on, the path is clear
I can't ignore, what's been building for years
There's wolves at the door, I won't hide here in fear
Wolves at the door, wah!

I look at myself and the things that I've done
Stare away from the mirror and right into the sun
I forgive myself for all of my mistakes
When will I learn, when will I, when will I burn

I want to drown, in a sea filled with Novocaine
I want to burn, on a beach where the sand
Is littered with razer blades

I gave up on myself a long time ago
To the black clouds I'm swallowed
And spit me out whole

Some times it feels like I'm losing my soul
At least that means
I still have a soul after all---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
