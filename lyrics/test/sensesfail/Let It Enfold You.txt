So the lie now is my weapon
Like a bush dried, withered in the sun
With a spark, I'll go up in flames.

I'd lay my guts out, but they're to small to see
It's kinda cute how I pretend to be
Everything but the instrument I am

Peace and happiness
So let it enfold you.

A birth to life is what I'm after
My first name won't be my last one
Let the light just drip into your eyes

So it's true, my words are contrived
I tell lies just to get into your mind
I'm as fake as a widow's smile.

This mask of glass is what I choose to wear
So I won't ever have that need to bear
The total truth to anyone but me.

Peace and happiness
So let it enfold you.

A birth to life is what I'm after
My first name won't be my last one
Let the light just drip into your eyes.

The light(the light)
Into(into)
Your eyes(your eyes)
All night(all night)

I'm just a bad actor
Stuck with a shitty script
All of my lines are cheap
And the cast is weak

There was no music for
The first time I got kissed
There was no femme fatale
My mistress wasn't rich

So I've been formatted
To fit your TV screen
The film went straight to tape
I'll bow out quietly
So quietly, so quietly

Please do this now, I beg
Duct tape my arms and leg
Throw me into the sea
Please save me, please save me (x2)

Now watch the waves eat me
Setting my cold heart free
I'll wash ashore in weeks
You can't save me
You cant save me

Now watch the waves eat me
Setting my cold heart free
I'll wash ashore in weeks
You can't save me
You can't save me now.---Lyrics submitted by Pablo.
