This island has become an ocean
and my boat's too small.
The waves are crashing in
and I can't save this sinking ship.

I sent out signal flares,
but no one out there seems to care.
Now the voice inside my head
is the only thing that I have left.

This is the part where I'll admit
I'm getting what I deserve.

And now I'm lost at sea,
I'm drowning in what I won't be.
I'm haunted by the sound.
(sweet sound of my last breath)

20 days at sea,
My skin is blistered from the heat.
I can beg and I can plea
What I get is never what I need.

This is the part where I'll admit,
I'm getting what I deserve.

And now I'm lost at sea;
I'm drowning in what I won't be.
I'm haunted by the sound.
(sweet sound of my last breath)

And now I'm lost at sea,
I'm drowning in what I won't be.
I'm haunted by the sound.
(sweet sound of my last breath)

Whoa oh oh Whoa whoa oh
I'm going down I'm going down
Whoa oh oh Whoa whoa oh
I'm going down I'm going down

This is the part where I'll admit,
I'm getting what I deserve.

And now I'm lost at sea,
I'm drowning in what I won't be.
I'm haunted by the sound.
(sweet sound of my last breath)

And now I'm lost at sea,
I'm drowning in what I won't be.
I'm haunted by the sound.
