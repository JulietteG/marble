The garden state has never looked so pitiful and grey as I awake to the garbage men today.
I hope they take all of my old mistakes because I cant seem to shake them on my own.
My head, it spins when I look at the mirror
And spit at the man I see with anchors for his eyes.
I build my castles up in the sky so when it rains they melt away with shame.

Here I am looking down at the bottom of the glass.
Is this all my fault that I need a sign like shooting stars,
To help connect the dots and turn my cuts into scars?

All of my fears are kept in check by the medicine I take
And all of the guards are scared theres rumors of dissent.
There will be a riot in my heart soon, it wants to beat beneath the open sky.

Here I am looking down at the bottom of the glass.
Is this all my fault that I need a sign like shooting stars,
To help connect the dots and turn my cuts into scars?

My regrets are what keep me still alive. I need to make up for all the lies.
My regrets are what keep me still alive. I need to make up for all the lies.

Here I am looking down at the bottom of the glass.
Is this all my fault that I need a sign like shooting stars,
To help connect the dots and turn my cuts into scars?

Here I am looking down at the bottom of the glass.
Is this all my fault that I need a sign like shooting stars,
To help connect the dots and turn my cuts into scars?

My regrets are what keep me still alive. I need to make up for all the lies.---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
