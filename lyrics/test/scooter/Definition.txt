Jumping is an ability that most humans and many animals share to some degree. 
It is the process of getting ones body off the ground for a short time using only ones own power 
Usually by propelling oneself upwards by contraction and then forceful extension of the legs 
In some cases the height of a jump may be increased by using a trampoline 
or by pushing down with the arms whilst playing leapfrog 
one can jump up to reach something high 
or jump over a fence or ditch 
or jump down and one can jump whilst dancing 
and as a sport 
but jump also is the synonym for an exciting style of dancing just to freak out for sometime 
now listen to the sounds of Michael, Rick and the Chicks Terminator.
