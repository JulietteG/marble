You light up another cigarette,
And I pour the wine.
It's four o'clock in the morning,
And it's starting to get light.

You light up another cigarette,
And I pour the wine.
It's four o'clock in the morning,
And it's starting to get light.

Here we go!
Yeah!
C'mon!

Energy, energy g' gise, for the raving enterprise,
MC, what day is it?
I've lost my f*cking memory.
The master mic enforcer, bass junky's what I am.
I rock you on the dance floor, feel the noise - we got the jam.

I got the classy swag,
Now that's why I get flagged.
More like a taxi cab,
Where are the chicks to check? (down the floor)

Yeah!

Skibadee skibadee g' gise, I will never compromise,
MC, what time is it?
I've lost my f*cking memory.
The master getting faster, no diggedy's who I am,
That's why I paid the money, going mental and get the jam.

I got the classy swag,
Now that's why I get flagged.

Where are the chicks to check? (down the floor)
