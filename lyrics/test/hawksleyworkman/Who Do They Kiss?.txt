Where are all these people going
In their cars, in their funny clothes
With their glasses on
Oh tell me
Where are all these people going
With their sadness on
Thinking strong, where do they belong?
Oh baby

Everybody gets born to a mommy and a dad
All their dreams are getting worn
And their schools make 'em sad
In the loneliest part of the night
Who do they kiss?

Where do these people need to be
On the plane, running though the rain
Grounded by the game, more lately
Who are all these people calling
Want their story heard, caging birds
Shouting useless words
Oh baby

To be honest
I used to sit in the subway early in the morning
With everybody nodding and falling asleep
And all I wanted to do is weep
Because I realized
I would never understand the complexities
Of all the stories intertwined, intertwined, intertwined---Lyrics submitted by London Mabel.
