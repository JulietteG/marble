You slept through the last small town, 
I'll wak you up when the next one comes around.
You're eyes are closed, like you truly believe..
You're safe and sound with Me.

No looking back, no turning into salt
The city was crumblin but baby were not too far oh oh ooh
When things got too rough I promised you we'd leave 
You're safe and sound with me. 

You're safe and sound with me ya ay ah oh 
Just like you always will
Just like you always will be

The wipers clear the windshield of the rain 
My shirt sleeve dries your eyes the very same 
We fit together like the ignition and the key
You're safe and sound with me 

You're safe and sound with mee ya ay ah oh
Just like you always will 
Just like you always will be

[interlude]

Oooh you're safe and sound with me ya ay ah oh
Just like you always will 
Just like you always will be

The glove box light shines bright enough to see 
You read the map like you were reading poetry 
It just might take you forever to see 
That your safe and sound with me.---Lyrics submitted by Kirsten.
