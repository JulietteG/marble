When I get high
I get high on speed
Top fuel funny car's
A drug for me
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart
Always got the cops
Coming after me
Custom built bike doing 103
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart

Whoa, are you ready girls?
Whoa, are you ready now?
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah, baby
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby

Skydive naked
From an aeroplane
Or a lady with a
Body from outerspace
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart
Say I got trouble
Trouble in my eyes
I'm just looking for Another good time
My heart, my heart
Kickstart my heart

Whoa, are you ready girls?
Whoa, are you ready now?
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah, baby
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby

Ooh, kickstart my heart...

When we started this band
All we needed, needed was a laugh
Years gone by...
I'd say we've kicked some ass
When I'm enraged
Or hittin' the stage
Adrenaline rushing
Through my veins
And I'd say we're still kickin' ass

Ooo, ahh, kickstart my heart
Hope it never stops
And to think, we did all of this to rock

Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby

Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, hope it never stops
Whoa, yeah, baby

Whoa, yeah
Kickstart my heart, give it a start
Whoa, yeah
Okay boys, let's rock the house---Lyrics submitted by Devin.
