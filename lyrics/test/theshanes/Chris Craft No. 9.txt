Chris Craft number 9, you're welcome aboard
(welcome aboard)
Chris Craft number 9, I'll show you the way
(show you the way)

Take you out on the sea
Yes, to show you what it's like
Don't you realise
This is really livin' life?

Chris Craft number 9, you're welcome aboard
(welcome aboard)
Chris Craft number 9, I'll show you the way 
(show you the way)

My Chris Craft number is nine (is nine)
I'm well over, 'cause she is mine (is mine)
I ain't got nothing to say
Chris Craft!

Chris Craft number 9, you're welcome aboard
(welcome aboard)
Chris Craft number 9, I'll show you the way 
(show you the way)

Don't you think it's fab
being at the sea all day?
Don't you realise 
This is really livin' life?

Chris Craft number 9, you're welcome aboard
(welcome aboard)
Chris Craft number 9, I'll show you the way 
(show you the way)

Chris Craft, 
Chris Craft, 
Chris Craft,
Chris Craft!---Lyrics submitted by FrancescaDavies.
