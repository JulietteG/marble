I wanna give you the good life
Just hold my hand and close your eyes
I'm gonna take you for a ride
Baby, we're going somewhere new
Our future looks so clear tonight
The stars reflecting in your eyes
Wish I could capture it for you

I'll by your side through the lows, through the highs
If you just be our show to the places I go
I wanna give you the good life
Let's start a round, let's see every city at one night
I'll change the world, I wanna give you the good life
Yeah, got to leave this town
I wanna give you the good life
The good life, the good life, the good life

Just spin the Globe and close your eyes
There's not a place too far to fly
Take off across the ocean blue
Even a million meters high,
Some baggage never leaves your sight
Just like I won't believe in you

I'll by your side through the lows, through the highs
If you just be our show to the places I go
I wanna give you the good life
Let's start a round, let's see every city at one night
I'll change the world, I wanna give you the good life
Yeah, got to leave this town
I wanna give you the good life
The good life, the good life, the good life---
