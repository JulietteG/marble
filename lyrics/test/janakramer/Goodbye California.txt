Ten days of L.A. palm trees
I loved that sunshine on me
Cant beat that perfect blue sky, no
But goodbye Hollywood, hey
Im leaving on a jet plane
To see my baby tonight, oh
Red red roses in his hands
So glad to be back home
Home sweet home

I like boots, you, your drunk tattoo
Drivin in the country when the daffodils bloom
I like your mustang, your sexy hot twang
Country fried chicken is a beautiful thing
Oh all I wanna do is hug and hold ya
Hello to love and so goodbye California

I love the southern moonlight
I love them lemon moon pies
I love the sweet cherry wine, oh
I like the tiny town were in
Love it when the preacher says am
en Love me a gentle southern man
West coast love you
Oh but Im so glad to be back home
Home sweet home

I like boots, you, your drunk tattoo
Drivin in the country when the daffodils bloom
I like your mustang, your sexy hot twang
Country fried chicken is a beautiful thing
Oh all I wanna do is hug and hold ya
Hello to love and so goodbye California

Girls in bikinis on beaches
But we have sweet Georgia peaches
I love the way the country feels
And I hate four-inch heels
I like boots, you, your drunk tattoo
Drivin in the country when the daffodils bloom
I like your mustang, your sexy hot twang
Country fried chicken is a beautiful thing
Oh all I wanna do is hug and hold ya
Hello to love and so goodbye

I like boots, you, your drunk tattoo
Drivin in the country when the daffodils bloom
I like your mustang, your sexy hot twang
Country fried chicken is a beautiful thing
Oh all I wanna do is hug and hold ya
Hello to love and so goodbye to California ---Lyrics submitted by Presleigh Jean.
