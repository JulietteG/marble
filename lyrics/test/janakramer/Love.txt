I still believe in fairy tales
I still believe in picking flowers
I still believe in getting lost in someone's eyes
And talking for hours

I still believe in shooting stars
I still believe in midnight drives
And butterflies you give right before you kiss
For the very first time

Love how many times can our heart break
And love how much weight can soul take
And love I don't know where you ran off to
But love love love
I still believe in you

I still believe in miracles
I still believe in wedding rings and bibles
I still believe the best walk you'll ever take is
Walking down the isle

Love how many times can our heart break
And love how much weight can soul take
And love I don't know where you ran off to
But love love love
I still believe in you
Yeah, I still believe in you

I still believe that you'll come knocking on my door
When I'd least expect you to
You give me something I can hope
You pull me through, 'cause that's what you do
That's what you do love
Yeah that's what you do love

Love how many times can our heart break
And love how much weight can soul take
And love I don't know where you ran off to
But love love love
Ooh love love love
I still believe in you
I still believe in you
Yeah I still believe in you---Lyrics submitted by Courtney Green.
