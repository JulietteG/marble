Oh Oh Oh
Oh Yeah
Oh Oh Oh

I come from the bottom 
hey, but I made it
I've been dead broke and
I've been famous

Yeah
I'm not afraid to get dirty
I've seen concrete grow roses

But you know it's not an easy life
yeah, we all get a second try
And it don't matter what you have
Or the cars you drive
It's gonna be a crazy ride

You know the storm can't last long
But after every cloud there's a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past 
Get ya back on track you know

Let's be blind to all the colors
'cuz we're all sisters and brothers
we are
we are superstars together

Oh Oh Oh
Through all the hate and love
we bounce back again

Oh Oh Oh
It's alright
yeah that's life

Yeah my 99 problems ain't gonna stop me
I got air to breathe and my heart beat
It can try to hold me down
I know exactly who I'm gonna be
Yeah

And out of nowhere life can cut ya
But that don't mean that no one loves ya
You know you gotta keep your head up
Yeah you gotta keep  your head up

You know the storm can't last long
But after every cloud there's a rainbow
Just leave your troubles in the past
Get ya back on track you know

Let's be blind to all the colors
'cuz we're all sisters and brothers
we are
we are superstars together

Oh Oh Oh 
Through all the hate and love
we bounce back again

Oh Oh Oh
It's alright
yeah that's life

Let's be blind to all the colors
'cuz we're all sisters and brothers
we are 
we are superstars together

Oh Oh Oh
Through all the hate and love
we bounce back again

Oh Oh Oh
It's alright
yeah that's life

(Let's be blind to all the colors
'cuz we're all sisters and brothers 
we are
we are superstars together)

Another day
Another day
Another dollar

Yeah

Oh Oh Oh
Through all the hate and love
we bounce back again

Oh Oh Oh 
It's alright
yeah that's life---Lyrics submitted by Shayne OConnor.
