Some people try to listen,
To the bottom of a bottle,
Some people try to listen,
To a needle in their arm,
Some people try to listen,
To the money in their pocket,
Some people try to listen,
To anothers arms.

Chorus
You and I are not that different,
Weve got a void and were just trying to fill it up,
With something that will give just a little peace,
All we want is a hand to reach to, 
Open arms that say I Love You,
Well give anything to hear the voice of a saviour. 

Some people try to find it,
In blind ambition,
Some people try to find it,
Where no one else has gone,
Some people try to find it,
In the crowns of victory,
Some people get defeated, 
And lose the strength to carry on.

Chorus

The voice of a saviour Oh.
The voice of a saviour Oh..

Some people try to find it,
In the shadow of a steeple,
Some people try to find it,
In the back row pew,
Some people try to find it,
In the arms of Jesus,
Thats where I found it,
How about you

Chorus

The voice of a saviour ohhhhh
The voice of a saviour ohhhhh
Well give anything to hear,
The voice of a saviour ohhhhh (Repeat Twice)---Lyrics submitted by Kelisha.
