Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender and callow fellow
Try to remember, and if you remember
Then follow, follow

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember the kind of September
When love was an ember about the billow
Try to remember, and if you remember
Then follow, follow

Deep in December it's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made as mellow
Deep in December our hearts should remember
And follow, follow, follow...---Lyrics submitted by richard.
