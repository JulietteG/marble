Cannons pound into the night
Angels soar into the sky
The battle rages on
Deliverance unholy one

The seeds of hate fly tonight
Good and evil light the sky
Another vision from inside
I know it's wrong I can't deny

For seven years I have reigned
In this damned and desolate hell
Now I've lived the masters vengeance
It saved me from myself

We paint the sky with blood tonight
Setting free the damned to fight
The whore of Babylon is here

The end of the storm is near

Pure evil
Feel the pain from the jackals wrath
Pure evil
Dance in flames for the final quest

Hear the ghost of violence
Fear the God of detriment

The land on earth is soaked with blood
Hear the screams of the helpless ones
Axes yield and daggers fly
Ripping through all flesh in sight---Lyrics submitted by vouli.
