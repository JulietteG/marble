It's six o'clock and I'm just waking up
to another lonely morning without you
Go get my coffee and think to myself
Just what am I gonna do?
Well I need some help to understand 
And only you can make it clear

Why do you have to look for love out there
When there's so much love here?

I spend so much time
With you on my mind
I barely can make it through the day
Fighting the urge to pick up the phone
And call just to see if you're ok
Then I hear your voice
Or you stumble (stumble by)
And my worries disappear

Why do you have to look for love out there
When there's so much love here?

Whoooo...you're always on the run
I know you're having fun
Pretending to look
For that very special someone
But if you keep on disrespecting me
I know there's gonna be
A day when you're gonna find me gone
Ooooh....oooo...oooo....oooo....owwww

I'm gonna to defend you right or wrong
I'm always on your side
And you know I'm the one
To soothe your soul
when there are troubles on your mind

Its just a waste of time 
To try and find
Another love thats better than mine
I'm telling you
That dream will never be, no no
There's no need
Don't have to look for love
When there's so much love here.

So much love, so much love,
I wanna ask you something, why?
I just don't understand.

So much love, so much love
I want you to have
All of my love
