Every day, every night
I wanna wear them liking by your side
Oh how nice, it would be
To have a little holiday days
Destination I don't care
We can go anywhere
Take me anywhere
Good times are right here
Reach out and touch in
Baby touch it

Vacation, oh oh
I wanna go, I wanna go go go
Vacation, oh oh
I wanna go, I wanna go go go

Why do you, look so grave
I've got to secure foreign
Pack your bags, we got to go
Baby there's no doubt about it
Leave your troubles way behind
We're gonna have a good time
Have a good time
By know I think you know
Set the pace, and our goal
It's a no-goal

Vacation, oh oh
I wanna go, I wanna go go go
Vacation, oh oh
I wanna go, I wanna go go go

Baby moving everwhere
Put your feet in the sand
And we telling everyone
You about to enjoy
Every woman, every man
Put your feet in the sand
And have yourself some vacation
Every woman, every man
Put your feet in the sand
Every girl, and every boy
You're about to enjoy
Every woman, every man
Put your feet in the sand
And have yourself some vacation

Vacation, oh oh
I wanna go, I wanna go go go
Vacation, oh oh
I wanna go, I wanna go go go

Vacation
Every woman, every man
Vacation
Every girl, and every boy
Vacation
Go have yourself some vacation---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
