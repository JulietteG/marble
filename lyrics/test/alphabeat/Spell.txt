O oo o oo o oo o oo o oo o
o oo o oo o oo o o oo o oo o 2x

I've been thinking about you lately
You're on my mind
You do something to me baby
In ways I can't define

Whatever you're doing
You're doing it well
What is your secret won't you please tell
Cause my head is spinning
Spinning around
You let me know, boy
I won't let you down

Refrein

You put a spell on me
I don't know what to do
It's an ability
That draws me closer to you

Your magic
Has got me where I want to be
Your magic is happening in front of me

There's a power within you baby
It's controlling me
I know there's no way to fight it
I let it be

Whatever you're doing
You're doing it well
What is your secret won't you please tell
Cause my head is spinning
Spinning around
You let me know boy 
I won't let you down

refrein 2x

Can you feel the power lurking baby girl
I think the spell is working ah-oh 2x

refrein 2x

o oo o oo o oo o oo o oo o
