Everybody's trying to get to me
Every guy is out for the kill
I'm the type of girl worth pursuing
But I won't be caught standing still,I won't

You're blowin' all of your attention on me
Take your best shot,I bet you'll miss
You've got me interested enough to stand closer
Maybe try a little,kiss

You hit the bullseye,baby
(You hit the bullseye,baby)
Now I'm into you crazy
(You know you hit the mark)

Don't know how you got me started
(I'm not an easy target,hit)
(You hit the bullseye)
You hit my heart

I'm surprised the way you affect me
Like an arrow penetrating my heart
Naturally you seem to just get me
So obviously your pretty smart,ha,ha,ha

I like the way you're all dressed up ,messed up
I like the way you don't care
I was assertive that you'd ring my bell but
Then you whispered in my ear

You hit the bullseye,baby
(you hit the bullseye,baby)
Now I'm into you crazy
(You know you hit the mark)

Don't know how you got me started
(I'm not an easy target,hit)
(You hit the bullseye)
You hit my heart
You hit my heart

You didn't ask me for my number
Wait,you didn't ask me for my number
I like the fact that you didn't ask that
'cause you already got my number,huh

You hit the bullseye,baby
(You hit the bullseye,baby)
Now I'm into you crazy
(You know you hit the mark)

Don't know how you got me started
(I'm not an easy target,hit)
You hit the bullseye
You hit the bullseye
You hit the bullseye
You hit my heart---Lyrics submitted by Esther.
