No one needs to know how we feel
No one needs to understand
Cause they can't have a hold on us
It's not just any kind of love
I know when something is too sacred to touch

They don't see...
You're right where I want you and I think
You could be...
Something that's more than expected
Why let this go all the way down from here
I'm here.

We both tend to run when we're hurting
We both tend not to forgive and forget
The past can't have a hold on us
For you my heart will give its trust
I don't need as much of you
I just need your love

They don't see...
You're right where I want you and I think
You could be...
Something that's more than expected
Why let this go all the way down from here
I'm...

Here you go again
Doubting yourself
For no good reason
You're listening to someone else

They don't see...
You're right where I want you and I think
You could be...
Something that's more than expected
Why let this go all the way down from here
I'm here.---Lyrics submitted by charnelle.
