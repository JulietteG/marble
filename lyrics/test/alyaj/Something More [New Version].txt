I didn't know what was in store.
When I walked right through the door.
Then I saw you over there, our blue eyes locked in a stare.
I didn't know quite what to say, sometimes words get in the way.

[Chorus]
And I remember the night you said,
"Lets go for a ride" I didn't want the night to end.
Would we be more than friends?
Yet little did I know before,
we would be something more.

In black and white I read the screen,
all your lines and in-between.
Then your message on the phone,
I save to hear when I'm all alone.
And Now I know just what to say, this doesn't happen everyday.

[Chorus]
And I remember the night you said,
"Lets go for a ride" I didn't want the night to end.
Would we be more than friends?
Yet little did I know before, we would be something more.

Something more, something more. (na na na na,na na na yeah)
We would be something more, something more, something more.

I know we're both young, but we know how we feel.
We know what is false, and we know what is real.

And I remember the night you said "lets go for a ride"...
I didnt want the night to end....

[Chorus]
And I remember the night you said,
"Lets go for a ride" I didn't want the night to end.
Would we be more than friends?
Yet little did I know before,
we would be something more.
And I remember the night you said,
"Lets go for a ride" I didn't want the night to end.
Would we be more than friends?
Yet little did I know before, 
we would be something more.

Something more, something more. (na na na na,na na na yeah)
Something more, something more. (na na na na,na na na yeah)---Lyrics submitted by anette.
