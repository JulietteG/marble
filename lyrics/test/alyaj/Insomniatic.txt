Rolled over from last night's dreams
Happiness isn't from a
drink me up in your thoughts
Just like I do with you
Are you left thirsty too?

Whoa-oh oh
I am erratic
Can't break the habit
My current status
With you I'm insomniatic

My train is off the track
It seems delirious from my loss of sleep-
Deprived, I greet the day
Won't be easy to do
Are you this restless too?

Whoa-oh oh
I am erratic
Can't break the habit
My current status
With you I'm insomniatic

One by one
The days grow longer and longer
And I, in my own sweet pain grow stronger
I must admit, I must admit, I must admit
it's a good insane
I must admit, I must admit, hear me admit!

Whoa-oh oh
I am erratic
Can't break the habit
My current status
With you I'm insomniatic---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
