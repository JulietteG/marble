[Verse]
You were the one
that i could find
hidden away
in the depths of my mind

[Chorus]
why did i let you go your too good to be true
I messed it up now i dont know what to do
we ran into circles and waisted time... from right to wrong from right to wrong


If i knew that you were mine
i would have not waisted time
I wish i could erase the past
now its all collapsed, in my lap

[verse]
I over thought
so i locked up my heart
there you stood
your blue eyes
hidden underneath your hood

[Chorus]
why did i let you go your too good to be true
I messed it up now i dont know what to do
we ran into circles and waisted time... from right to wrong from right to wrong


If i knew that you were mine
i would have not waisted time
I wish i could erase the past
now its all collapsed, in my lap

[Bridge]
My mind is blank like a clean slate
will a meeting with a guy 
with the same blue eyes
and the same name and the converse shoes i gave
 will he have, the same laugh
wear my homemade hat.

Bet i'll make another mistake
and think that hes just another fake

Wish i could erase the past now
wish i could bring you back 

[Chorus]
why did i let you go your too good to be true
I messed it up now i dont know what to do
we ran into circles and waisted time... from right to wrong from right to wrong


If i knew that you were mine
i would have not waisted time
I wish i could erase the past
now its all collapsed, in my lap
