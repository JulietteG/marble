You openly admit
The things you like more are from me
Somehow I find it attractive
That you won't censor anything

With you there is no filter
To sugar coat what is said
Even though I like your honesty
It won't lead me to your bed so instead

Go ahead and say it
Even though you know it makes me uncomfortable
Go ahead and say it
If you must make me blush

You are so transparent
The farthest thing from perfect
Once again I am left out of breath
On the edge of losing it so instead

Go ahead and say it
Even though you know it makes me uncomfortable
Go ahead and say it
If you must make me blush

Please take me under with you
But I will only let you go so far
it can be our secret
You know what our boundaries are

Go ahead and say it
Even though you know it makes me uncomfortable
Go ahead and say anything
If you must
Please
Make me blush---Lyrics submitted by Carrie.
