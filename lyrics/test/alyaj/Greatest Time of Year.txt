There's a special kind of feeling in the air 
It only happens at this time of year 
When everyone is filled with love and cheer 
'Cause that's what matters 

Pretty paper boxes tied with bows 
Walking in the sun or in the snow 
We can feel the excitement growing, knowing 

It's the greatest time of year, and it's here, 
Help me celebrate it 
With everybody here, friends so dear, 
Let me simply state it 
Joy to the world and everyone, 
Lift up your hearts and feel the love 
It's our favorite way, to spend the holiday 
Yeah 

We can get all cozy by the fire 
Turn the music up a little higher 
I don't think that I could ever tire 
Of being together 

Decorate the tree, hang mistletoe 
And stand by me 
It's a picture perfect moment captured, 
Memories that we'll have after 

It's the greatest time of the year, and it's here, 
Help me celebrate it 
With everybody here, friends so dear, 
Let me simply state it 
Joy to the world and everyone 
Lift up your hearts and feel the love 
It's our favorite way, to spend the holiday 
Yeah 

Spend the holidays... 

It's the greatest time...of year
...time to celebrate...yea it's our favorate time...

It's the greatest time of year, and it's here, 
Help me celebrate it 
With everybody here, friends so dear, 
Let me simply state it 
Joy to the world 
Joy to the world 
Joy to the world 
It's the greatest time of year 
It's the greatest time 

It's the greatest time of year, and it's here, 
Help me celebrate it 
With everybody here, friends so dear, 
Let me simply state it 
Joy to the world and everyone 
Lift up your hearts and feel the love 
It's our favorite way, to spend the holiday------Lyrics submitted by Caitlin.
