On the subject of you being gone forever
I still can't believe it, I can't see it
I should just stop counting days
On the subject of the future
Wouldn't it be nice to leave it open-ended
And pretend it could go either way

If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back 
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say yes 
On the other hand it would be 
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back 
If I could have you back 

On the topic of the time we spent together
I can't say I never wondered if you ever think about these days

If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back 
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say yes 
On the other hand it would be 
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over

If I could have you back

It's game over
You lost this round 
And now I guessed I've turned you down
Thanks for all the lessons learned
I'm taking in what I have heard
(Practice makes perfect)

If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back 
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say yes 
On the other hand it would be 
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision -

If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice, I guess
If I could have you back 
I'd reconsider, maybe I'd say yes 
On the other hand it would be 
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back 
If I could have you back---Lyrics submitted by Zoe.
