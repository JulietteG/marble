I'll bet two years I'll bet one year
I'll bet those years you won't be here
I guess I'll keep, I guess you'll keep
Every memory
Sadly we may never be
I'll bet my tears I'll bet your tears
I'll bet those tears over time could disappear

Wait a minute I have more to say
and I can't reminisce need to me
I need you more than you'll ever know
I still do, willing to let it show

I need a minute just to get to you
I feel like I might be getting through
Come over and say nothing
Silence is everything (ohh)

I know, I know (I know, I know)
Feelings can show
If you let go-oh-oh-oh
It must be told (it must be told)
I've got a hold
On what we used to have

I will forgive if you forget
All the things we said
Let's accept it
I need you, more than you'll ever know
I still do, willing to let it show

I need a minute just to get to you
I feel like I might be getting through
Come over and say nothing
Silence is everything
