To my surprise I found my daylight
In summer skies, yeah whoa
Colors came out of waves
When I first saw your face shine through
A spotlight fell that day
I'll make this loud so you can hear me say

Hey there, one in a million
I feel alive as our love, it collides
You put life into motion
You've got me spinning
You're spinning me out of control

Girl, dream big, we'll do it again
When the city calls
Hand in hand, this is love
Buildings tower over us

You're a queen, won't you dance?
Won't you sing your melody?
Smile for the best days exist
I'm the luckiest, you're the reason for this

Hey there, one in a million
I feel alive as our love, it collides
You put life into motion
You've got me spinning
You're spinning me out of control

As my life explodes
You've got me hanging on, I'm hanging on
I'm out of control as my life explodes
You've got me hanging on forever
And we're hanging on forever
And we're hanging on forever

Hey there, one in a million
Hey there, one in a million
One in a million, life's in motion
You've got me spinning 
As our worlds collide

Hey there, one in a million
I feel a live as our love, it collides
You put life into motion
You've got me spinning
You're spinning me out of control, I'm out of control
Hey there, one in a million---Lyrics submitted by Keisha.
