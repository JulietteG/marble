So many lost to the shadows
We pretend that there's nothing at stake
Is it fact that we follow
All the fictional steps that we take

Trying hard to leave behind
This mannequin motion (mannequin motion)
Fighting just to just stay alive

I've got to get back to the basics
Back to the basics now
I'm running circles there's only one way out
Everything inside of me
Is telling me that it's about time to open my eyes
Back to the basics 
Cause I can make this right

It's now or never
Now or never
No more wasting time
It's getting better once we sever and erase this ties

It's now or never (now or never)
Now or never
Like a shot from a starting gun

Racing for the finish line
But I'm just running blurry eyed
Chasing something I can't find

Back to the basics
Back to the basics now
I'm running circles there's only one way out
Everything inside of me
Is telling me that it's about time to open my eyes
Back to the basics
Cause I can make this

It's just a mannequin motion life
That keeps us from the other side
Fighting just to stay alive
It goes on (goes on)

Back to the basics
Back to the basics now
I'm running circles there's only one way out

Back to the basics
Back to the basics now
I'm running circles there's only one way out
Everything inside of me
Is telling me that it's about time to open my eyes
Back to the basics
Cause I can't face this life

It's now or never make it right
It's now cause I cant' face this life

It's now or never
Going back to the basics---Lyrics submitted by Xyrus.
