Oh, my chains, I cant disengage, 
And I dont believe that I want to
One hand sings your praise
The other brings me shame
And I have selfishness to blame

And Im singing for freedom, 
And I know Im not the only one 
praying to the one 
who can bring me this freedom
Im ready for changechange, change, change

Broken down I lay
I keep holding my chains
No longer bound but here I stay
I scream father please, I need rescuing 
I need you and you alone

And Im singing for freedom, 
I know Im not the only one 
praying to the one 
who can bring me this freedom
Im ready for, Im ready for

Still you patiently await
Yet I wont just let go
I see you and you alone
Saying, come follow me
Despair has come so that you can see

RELEASE!

So Im singing, for freedom
So Im singing for freedom
The time has come
Separation lost the war to love
Take my hand

Grace has found you where you once began
Youre alive, youre alive
In the waking of new life
Take my hand
In the end, theres only love, theres only love!

Theres only, singing for freedom
I know Im not the only one praying to the one
Who can bring me this freedom
Im ready for, Im ready for

Father please, I need rescuing
I need you and you alone---Lyrics submitted by serena.
