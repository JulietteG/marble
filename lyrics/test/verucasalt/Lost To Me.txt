Im like a bird without a home
I have the urge to be alone
Too much interpreting the signs
Too much to read between the lines
I got a sympathetic ear
I think Ill find my comfort here
Take a break from the machine
Ill see you in my dreams

Youre lost to me...

Our house is lit up by the moon
I see you hiding in your room
Its getting worse, you wanna leave
Youre under contract, under siege
My love, what have they done to you
You leave the glitter, take the glue

Youre lost to me...
Youre lost at sea
Youre lost to me

I hung up the phone
I could hardly wait to eliminate you
You hung up the phone
And without a word we kicked it to the curb
And nobody argued, no one heard

I see the future in your face
Were going to war, were going to waste
Youre disappearing in the dark
You play the role, you play the part
Its Wednesday morning on the beach
Youre out of contact, out of reach

Youre lost to me...
Youre lost at sea
Youre lost to me---
