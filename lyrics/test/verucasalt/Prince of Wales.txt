I remember that day
I remember the weight
of you
I remember that ho-
tel room
I remember that sign
I remember the line
you drew

I remember that girl

I remember that girl

I remember that night
I remember that heart-shaped moon
I remember that light
I remember the spaceship, too
Yeah

I remember that girl

I remember that girl

I remember that day
I remember the love
I remember the blood
you drew
I remember that ho-
tel room
I remember it all
Do you?

I remember that girl---
