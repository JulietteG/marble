I know its late but its better than never
I always thought that you would live forever
I should have told you then but
Im telling you now

I had to stop cause I couldnt stand the feedback
Off the rails and I didnt want to be that
I didnt have the facts so
Im telling you now

Im telling you now
When the door has closed and the whole world knows
That its over
Im telling you now
When the dust has cleared and you cannot hear me
you cannot
Im telling you

It got bitter and I didnt want to taste it
I lost your number and I never replaced it
I couldnt face it then so
Im telling you now

Im telling you now
When the crowds gone home and were all alone
and its over
Im telling you now
When the bars have closed and the streets are frozen
its over
Im telling you now
When the dust has cleared and you cannot hear me
you cannot hear

I waited for the right time
But the right time never came
It doesnt mean a thing until
You call it by its name
I should have called it then

Im telling you now
When the door has closed and God only knows
that its over
Im telling you now
When the lights come on and the freaks are gone
And were older
Im telling you now
Im saying it loud and clear
Im still here

I had to stop cause I couldnt stand the feedback
I heard a rumor and I couldnt believe that
I heard it twice and the whole world went black
Im kneeling down on the tracks

Im telling you now...
(I had to stop cause I couldnt stand the feedback)...
Im telling you---
