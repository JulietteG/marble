I've been all around Gutter Town
Looking for a better frown
Beating on misery's door.

Looking high and looking low
I guess I'm one of those lost souls
Who just don't quite fit in no more.

Drifting, used and feeling down
Staring at another round
Will not that time turn into day.

Taking good times when you're blue
Well there'll be someone there for you
When you're dying on your dying day.

(CHORUS)
Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you

Racing down that reckless road
Has hard advise that we all know
Take what you can and learn from it.

I once saw a Satanist loose his life
He was rolling the devil with his dice
I guess he was ready to call their quits.

Fighting all night just to keep in line
trying too hard not to loose my mind
watching all the folks doing the same.

I've been all around Gutter Town
looking for a better frown
why can't no one here remember my name?

(CHORUS)
Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you

(instrumental)

I've had hard times trying to beat my wife,
but I never really like the kind of trouble 
they got me in along the way.

So I got me a dog and I solved it all
Now me and him are making up our own laws 
There's something about living this kind of way.

Had me a friend in Birmingham
Got a twenty years sentence for a one night stand 
At least he did the time for his son.

I've done it more than once or twice
And I've made it through my darkest nights 
You know I'll always be living on the run.

Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you---Lyrics submitted by Darrell.
