Let us burn one 
From end to end 
And pass it over 
To me my friend 
Burn it long, we'll burn it slow 
To light me up before I go 

If you don't like my fire 
Then don't come around 
'Cause I'm gonna burn one down 
Yes I'm gonna burn one down 

My choice is what I choose to do 
And if I'm causing no harm 
It shouldn't bother you 
Your choice is who you choose to be 
And if your causin' no harm 
Then you're alright with me 

If you don't like my fire 
Then don't come around 
'Cause I'm gonna burn one down 
Yes I'm gonna burn one down 

Herb the gift from the earth 
And what's from the earth 
Is of the greatest worth 
So before you knock it try it first 
You'll see it's a blessing 
And it's not a curse 

If you don't like my fire 
Then don't come around 
'Cause I'm gonna burn one down 
Yes I'm gonna burn one, uh---
