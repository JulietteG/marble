You say you've been overseas, and i say overwhelmed
You say its just a holiday, my alley say she lived
I say i've been working late, working overtime
Haven't seen a sun in 6 to 9

--Chorous--

Does the moonlight shine on Paris, after the sun goes down?
If the London Bridge is Falling, Can anybody hear a sound?
If you follow the sunset, Will it ever end?
Does the moonlight shine on Paris...

Oh ! and how can you just walk away, is something that i say
I see only black and white, you see clear and red
You believe in the miracles, wondering into wines
I believe when it makes the New Your Times
