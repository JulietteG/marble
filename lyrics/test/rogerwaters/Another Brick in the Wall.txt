When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers
Who would hurt the children anyway they could

By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in this town it was well known
When they got home at night their fat and psychopathic wives
Would trash them within inches of their lives

We don't need no education
We don't need no thoughts control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

We don't need no education
We don't need no thoughts control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey! Teachers! Leave those kids alone!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

"Wrong, Do it again!"
"If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding. 
How can you
have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?"
"You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still laddy!"---Lyrics submitted by Chula!.
