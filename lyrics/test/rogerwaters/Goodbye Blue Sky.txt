Oooh, oooh, oooh ooh ooh ooh.
Oooh, oooh, oooh ooh ooh ooh.

Di-di-di-didja see the frightened ones?
Di-di-di-didja hear the falling bombs?
Di-di-di-didja ever wonder why we had
to run for shelter when the promise of the brave
blew out and fell beneath the clear blue sky?

Oooh, oooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh.

Di-di-di-didja see the frightened ones?
Di-di-di-didja hear the falling bombs?

The flames are all long gone,
But the pain lingers on.

Good bye, blue sky.
Good bye, blue sky, goodbye.
Goodbye.---Lyrics submitted by Donny.
