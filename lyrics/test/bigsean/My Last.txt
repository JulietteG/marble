[Chris Brown] 
Hands up in the air 
I just want the 
I just want the baddest bitch in the world 
Right here on my lap 

And Imma hit this drink up like its my last 
Imma hit this night up like its my last 
Imma Imma hmm hmm, like its my last (boi) 
Swear Imma, swear Imma get it like 
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 

[Big Sean] 
Ok, now where that alcohol 
You aint even got to ask 
Cause Imma drink it all like, like its my last 
She a 7 in the face, but a 10 in the ass 
She even look better by the end of my glass 
See I just walked in fresher than the shirts off in 
this muthf-cka 
Ima need a bad broad to twirk off in this muthaf-cka 
Imma go hard till it hurts off in this muthaf-cka 
Imma ball so you gotta work off in this muthaf-cka 
The work, and I can get you anything you want 
I could, I could, I could put you on 
See you look like Beyonce so do it like Beyon 
Do it like Beyonce and put it on Sean 
Grind hard but a got a lot to show for it 
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it 
My teams so true we should get a camera crew 
To follow us around and make a show for us 

[Chris Brown - Hook] 
And Imma hit this drink up like its my last 
Imma hit this night up like its my last 
Imma Imma hmm hmm, like its my last (boi) 
Swear Imma, swear Imma get it like 
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 

[Big Sean - Verse 2] 
Now, Imma fill this glass up like its my last 
Imma do, do it, like its my last 
Imma spend this cash up like its my last 
And Imma make it last, like its my last 
And Im gone, cant remember where I am 
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am 
And they introduce my fan 
Now she all up in space 
All all up in my face like you remember who I am 
Since I signed the con, Im Louie Vuitton shine 
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the Wonton 
Rose rose over a little Chandon 
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John 
Man I just ended up on everybody guestlist 
Im just doing better than what everybody projected 
Knew that Id be here so if you asked me how I feel 
Imma just tell you, its everything that I expected 
Boi, boi 

[Chris Brown] 
Hands up in the air 
(One time for the West side, let me see them hands..) 
Hands up in the air 
(Two times if you love GOOD Music) 
Hands up in the air 
(And three times for the baddest chick in the World 
who got her hands up in the air) 
Hands up in the air 

[Chris Brown - Hook] 
And Imma hit this drink up like its my last 
Imma hit this night up like its my last 
Imma Imma umm umm, like its my last (boi) 
Swear Imma, swear Imma get it like 
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 

[Bridge] 
Big ass bottles, Big Ice buckets 
I work too hard to be ballin on a budget 
Me and my people do it big out in public cause 
Cause if you dont do it big, you aint doing nothing 

[Chris Brown - Hook] 
And Imma hit this drink up like its my last 
Imma hit this night up like its my last 
Imma Imma umm umm, like its my last (boi) 
Swear Imma, swear Imma get it like 
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all 
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all---Lyrics submitted by Jesus Villalpan.
