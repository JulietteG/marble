Guess not its official
Cant back out, cant back out (no)
Getting ready for the night of nights
The night of nights, alright
Dont Panic (Panic!)

Now do we have to dress up for the prom
Dude I dont think we have the choice
Yeah its the night of all nights
Gotta look just right
Dressing to impreses the boys

Do I want to classic or vitage or plaid?
Wheres the mirror?
I think this tux is too baggy
Too tight, it makes me look weird.

Should I go movie star glamorous, sassy or sweet?
Dont know, but no one  better wear the same dress as me
Its the night of our nightmares
Its the night of our dreams
Its too late to back out of it.
Hey, makeovers, massages.
Dont know what a corsage is.
Been waiting all our lives for this.

Its gonna be a night (cant wait)
To remember (aw man)
Come on now, big fun (alright)
Its gonna be the night (I guess)
To last forever (lucky us)
Well never ever ever forget

Gettin Ready, Get Getting Ready
Gettin Ready, Get Getting Ready
(Hey you been in there an hour man)
So, what should I do to my hair?
Wheres my shaver?
Ooh, I love it.
I look like a waiter.
Should I fluff it?
Its get later already should be there.

Her mother opens the door, Im shakin inside
Hes here, its time, the hours arrived.
Dont know why, her fathers staring me down
Wheres my purse? Lip gloss? Now im really freaking out.
Then something changes my world
The msot beautiful girl right in front of my eyes

Its gonna be a night (Oh Yea!)
To remember (Thats for sure)
Come on now, big fun (Alright!)
Its gonna be the night (Yea tonight)
To last forever (forever more)
Well never ever ever forget.

Whos that girl? (Shes so fine)
Whos that guy? (I dont recognize)
Whos that girl? (She looks so good, yea)
Youll never really notice, but yu probably should.---Lyrics submitted by yasmine.
