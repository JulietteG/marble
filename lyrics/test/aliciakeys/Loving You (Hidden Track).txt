Ever since I was kissed off
I've been more than slightly pissed off
So I wrote this song to tell you how I feel
Sure it's true you're pretty
You're charming, warm, and witty
But other than that, you just ain't no big deal.

So darlin', here's my message
Read it loud and clear
Get your head out of your ass and get your ass right out of here
'Cause there's no percentage in this
There ain't nothin' to be won
Lovin' you's the dumbest fuckin' thing I've ever done.

Well I placed you high above me
I let you push and shove me
Like a lovesick fool, I took it all in stride
I let you annoy me
But I won't let you destroy me
And this song is proof that I've still got my pride!

So darlin', here's my message
Read it loud and clear
Get your head out of your ass and get your ass right out of here
'Cause there's no percentage in this
There ain't nothin' to be won
Lovin' you's the dumbest fuckin' thing I've ever done.

I said lovin' you's the dumbest fuckin' thing I've ever done...---Lyrics submitted by Cameron.
