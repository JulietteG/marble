Everyday nothing seems to change.
Everywhere I go I keep seeing the same old thing & I..
I can't take it no more.
Oh, I would this town but I ain't got no where else to go.
Wake up in the morning, oh, more bad news.
& I.. Sometimes I feel like I was borne to lose & I..
It's driving me out of my mind.
I'll catch the next train & I.. I'll move on down the line.

Whoah I'll be ready now. I'll be ready when my train pulls in.
Whoah I'll be ready now. I'll be ready when my train pulls in.
I know my time ain't long around here.
& I can't live this life again.

Walking down the streets you might run across a smilng face.
But they'll stab you in the back as soon as you turn & walk away
& I.. Oh Lord it's bringing me down.

If things don't change around here, ain't no use in me hanging 'round.

Whoah I'll be ready now. I'll be ready when my train pulls in.
Whoah I'll be ready now. I'll be ready when my train pulls in.
I know my time ain't long around here.
& I can't live this life again.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
