Oh no, no, I ain't gonna worry no more
Oh no, no, I ain't gonna worry no more
Well you can judge me how you want to, but I 
I ain't gonna worry no more

Oh no, no, you can't stop me now
Oh no, no, you can't stop me now, no
Yeah I'm gonna rise to the top
You can't hold me down

Oh no, bo, I refuse to back down
Oh no, no, I refuse to back down
I said I shall not be moved
I'm gonna stand my ground

I said I shall not be moved
I'm gonna stand my ground

I said I shall not be moved
I'm gonna stand my ground---Lyrics submitted by Ada.
