I don't believe in competition
Ain't nobody else like me around
I don't need your imposition
It ain't that hard to figure it out

Give it up now
Play cool
Give it up now
Play cool

Give it up now
Don't let me down

Don't think too much of my disposition
You already know what's going down
Don't wanna be your exhibition, no
I don't want nobody hanging around

Give it up now
Play cool
Give it up now
Play cool

Give it up now
Don't let me down
(x2)

Play cool
Play cool
Play cool

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up now---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
