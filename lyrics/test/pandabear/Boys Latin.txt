We don't have a sec to think
But we don't appreciate our things

Dark cloud descended again
Has a dark cloud descended again
Has a dark cloud descended again
And a shadow moves in
Dark cloud descended again
And a shadow moves in the darkness

We don't have a sec to think
But we don't appreciate our things---
