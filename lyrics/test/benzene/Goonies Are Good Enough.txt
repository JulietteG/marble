Here we are
Hanging onto strains of greed and blues
Break the chain then we break down
Oh it's not real if you don't feel it 
Unspoken expectations
Ideals you used to play with
They've finally taken shape for us.

What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (x2)

Now you'll say
You're starting to feel the push and pull
Of what could be and never can
You mirror me stumbling through those 

Old fashioned superstitions
I find too hard to break
Oh maybe you're out of place

But it's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (x2)

(Kick It!)

Old fashioned superstitions
I find too hard to break 
Oh maybe you're out of place

But it's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (x2)---Lyrics submitted by singuya.
