Just a little stretch of blacktop
Road signs full of buckshot
Most people dont stop
Unless their lost or out of gas

Downtown theres a courthouse
A little square you can go around
A caf thats right out
Of some movie from the past

Its the kind of place some people make fun of
And its the kind of place people like me love

Chorus:
Ill take this town 
Just the way it is
With the farms and barns and the cows and the corn
That I grew up with

Ill take this place
This way of life
Ill sit in the shade and Ill smile and Ill wave
As the cars go by

You can have that city life
The bright lights
The noise and the crowd
Ill take this town (Ill take this town)

Yeah gimme that barbershop
Where the old mean sit and talk
About the pass tha-that boy dropped
At the game on Friday night

And you can gimme that red dirt
Stained glass from the old church
And that muddy river
Where we all got baptized

People leave and say they wanna leave the world
But I'd rather settle doen right here with a little country girl
	-Lead Run-

Chorus

Ill take this town 
Just the way it is
With a dog in the yard
And a sky full of stars that I know I'd miss

Ill take this place
This way of life
And if its up to me
It's where I'm gonna be till the day I die

You can have that city life
The bright lights
The noise and the crowd

And when you come back
You can bet that
I'll still be around 
Ill take this town 
Ill take this town 
This town
And Ill take this town---Lyrics submitted by Jordan K.
