Stay with me tonight
We dont have to dance if we dont want to
Lets just sit and drink some wine
Looks like there was ring on your finger
Was your heart broke just like mine?
We could say goodnight to each other
Go home to a lonely house
But if you dont want to be alone
When you turn the lights out

Chorus:
Stay with me tonight
I want to feel you next to me
Well make believe its right
Until the sun comes up
Lets just say were in love
Stay with me tonight

Whats the point of missing someone
And waking up old regrets
We dont need moments to remember
Just a little time to forget

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
If you take my hand when its time to go 
Ill love you like theres no tomorrow
Stay with me tonight
When the sun comes up
It might just be love
Stay with me tonight---Lyrics submitted by Jordan K.
