this time of night i could call you up
id get angry with athletic ease
break common laws of two's and three's
and if i die clutching your photograph
don't call me boring its just cause i like you

oh take me out back, 
take me out back,
take me back,
to the place where i can feel your heart,
is this the end or just the start
of something really, really beautiful
wrapped up in disguise of 
something really, really ugly

wont you,

come by and see me 
im a love letter away,
ill break your name 
before i say,
i really love you, love you
now i don't care if you saw
i watched every inch of film
flash across your roman features
and i loved it, loved it

now i don't care if,

you think im eager to shut your eyes
well im sorry everybody knows
you cant break me with your gutter prose
would you believe it she sent me a letter
the ring it nearly weighs her down
she's got another boy, oh boy

steady your ears
steady your ears
and read my lips
poetry is not a luxury
its how i break this room
and when im really ill
wont you cradle me?
man is not a noble animal
but maybe woman is remember..

i heard you..

inside your room you said 
you never really live
until your back's against the wall
oh did you really mean it
oh id never break my gaze
just to see the scar reflected in your eyes
i think its time to go home

(guitar solo)

oh tell me your thoughts 
tell me your thoughts on liberty
see there's a place where i sink to sleeping
she said oh my vote is as red as my blood
will you join me for another round?
i havent had a chance to speak yet

god speed..

i break the law once every week
to feel your touch
whats a book to you in bed?
do you feel better? older?
this just makes me ill
your name is dripping from my pen
still you're not around to curse
ill drop the gun now, im still under you..

marianne, let the ghosts sleep tonight
marianne, let the ghosts sleep just shut your eyes and burn the past
marianne, let the ghosts sleep tonight
marianne, let the ghosts sleep just shut your eyes and burn the past away---Lyrics submitted by Brandon.
