The price to come down the tracks realization
will leave you numb (x4)

shes gotta pray for the life salvation we didnt
know, just as she scared (X2)

Its been preached from the beginning its hard
sometimes to let it sink in you try to be much
more and i'll try not to forget.

take it or throw it all away now baby cause 
no ones gotta save you. say you needed this
because say you need it all because.

the confidence valed by barness and 
hatred will leave you on.

the price to come down the tracks realization
will leave you numb. 

Its been preached from the beginning its hard
sometimes to let it sink in you try to be much
more and i'll try to not forget.

take it or throw it all away now baby cause
no ones gotta save you. say you needed this
because say you need it all because(x2)

Its time to see its time you know your all alone
well then now you know well then now you know

take it or throw it all away now baby cause
no ones gotta save you say you needed this
because say you need it all because(x2)

you write it down, you run away (x7)---Lyrics submitted by emma.
