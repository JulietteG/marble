Fer sure maybe 
fer sure not 
Fer sure eh 
fer sure bomb 
Pulled up at a stop light did drugs on the dashboard 
Look at the mess we made tonight 

Kick off your stilettos 
Kick off your stilettos 
And fuck me in the backseat 
Fuck me in the backseat 
You're always falling in disguise 
And always quick to compromise 

Kick off your stilettos [oh yeah] 
Kick off your stilettos 
And fuck me in the backseat [fa-fa-fa] 
Fuck me in the backseat 
Fer sure maybe 
fer sure not 
Fer sure eh 
fer sure bomb

This is the end of what we planned [of what we planned] 
And now. 

We're not falling in love 
We're just falling apart [so girl let's dance the night away] 
This is how the beat drops
This is how the beat drops [Just let your body go] 

This is how the beat drops 
This is how the beat drops [I wanna see your panties drop girl now] 
All this time is wasted pretending we're in love 
But that's alright cause you know 
I love being with you and seeing you cry 

So don't let go-o-o 
Well don't let go, no-o 
Don't let go 

Fer sure maybe 
fer sure not 
Fer sure eh 
fer sure bomb 
Pulled up at a stop light did drugs on the dashboard 
Look at the mess we made tonight 

Kick off your stilettos 
Kick off your stilettos 
And fuck me in the backseat 
Fuck me in the backseat 
You're always falling in disguise 
And always quick to compromise 

Kick off your stilettos [oh yeah] 
Kick off your stilettos 
And fuck me in the backseat [fa-fa-fa] 
Fuck me in the backseat 
Fer sure maybe 
fer sure not 
Fer sure eh 
fer sure bomb

This is the end of what we planned [of what we planned] 
And now. 

We're not falling in love 
We're just falling apart [so girl let's dance the night away] 
This is how the beat drops
This is how the beat drops [Just let your body go] 

This is how the beat drops 
This is how the beat drops [I wanna see your panties drop girl now] 
All this time is wasted pretending we're in love 
But that's alright cause you know 
I love being with you and seeing you cry 

So don't let go-o-o 
Well don't let go, no-o 
Don't let go 

No jkjkjk lololol 
I heart your fucking makeup 
Oh my god I love your hair 
Is that a new tattoo? 
Did that piercing fucking hurt? 
No jkjkjk lololol

We're not falling in love 
We're just falling apart [so girl let's dance the night away] 
This is how the beat drops
This is how the beat drops [Just let your body go] 

This is how the beat drops 
This is how the beat drops [I wanna see your panties drop girl now] 
All this time is wasted pretending we're in love 
But that's alright cause you know 
I love being with you and seeing you cry 

So don't let go-o-o [All this time is wasted] 
Well don't let go, no-o [Pretending we're in love] 
But that's alright cause you know 
I love being with you and seeing you cry 
But that's alright---Lyrics submitted by keyara.
