Wait...Contain me around
Only to...I spit!!
Step on my disease -
so nice to bleed
Step on my disease -
I cannot contain

Slow it down...I'm so winded
I've fallen down...again

Taste numb of my teeth
Forever makes me...sick!!

Step on my disease -
so nice to see me bleed
Step on my disease - I cannot contain

Slow it down...I'm so winded
I've fallen down...again
I follow the walking dead

Now that you found out
 - somewhat about me
I wonder how long it will be before
you leave

Slow it down - I'm so winded -
Slow it down
I've fallen down...again
Slow it down - I'm so winded
- So end it
I've fallen down...again I follow the walking dead
Spit!!
Stupid Fuck---Lyrics submitted by Clayton.
