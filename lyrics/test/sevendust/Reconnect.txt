Here we all are standing here
(Slave Me)
Embrace me
I try to hard to stay clear (Repay Me)
Embrace me

Slave (save me)
Save (forgive me)
Slave me (confuse me)

So glad the history is past
(You hate me)
You love me
I will not ever make fast (You rape me)

You hate me
Slave (save me)
Save (forgive me)
Slave me (confuse me)

Another day I feel further from myself

If you could wear my shoes
Then you'll see...(I need a day to recreate)
How we could feel so removed
From what could be (I need a day to reconnect)

What would happen if this were gone
Would you be there for how long

Slave (save me)
Save (forgive me)
Slave me (confuse me)

Another day I feel further from myself...
Another day I feel further from myself...

If you could wear my shoes
Then you'll see...(I need a day to recreate)
How we could feel so removed (I need a day to reconnect)
From what could be

I need a day (I need a day)
I need a day (I need a day)
I need a day (I need a day to recreate)

Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me---Lyrics submitted by Clayton.
