You look for love
Through eyes of strangers
Pitiful you go away
I think it's time to reconsider
In suspense you stay

I think my mind is slippin'
Know I'm trippin' feels like I am
Losing myself

I wish I held your life from dreaming
(soul - I wish I had life)
I wish I held your life from dreaming
(soul - I wish I had life)

In your mind
You're my puppet
I hope the strings
Give way in confused
Depths of reality
I wonder if you'll stay
I think my mind is slippin'
Know I'm trippin'  feels like I am losing myself
I wish I held your life from dreaming
(soul I wish I had life)
I wish I held your life from dreaming
(soul I wish I had life)

I own your dreams
In time, you'll see

I think my mind is slippin'
Know I'm trippin' feels like I am
Losing myself

I wish I held your life from dreaming
(soul I wish I had life)
I wish I held your life from dreaming
(soul I wish I had life)
I wish I held your life from dreaming
God damn I wish - I'm dreaming---Lyrics submitted by Clayton.
