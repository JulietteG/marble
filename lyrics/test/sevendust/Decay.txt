Warn, the voices out here that warn me.
The deepest lies adore you and consume you in every way,
You're giving us nothing.

(Chorus)
Decay, cut the tongue you speak with to say.
Don't believe, don't believe it
The wrong way, on a path to somewhere 
Don't feed the selfish mouth of man

Born into a life that depletes me,
Give empty words, that burns you,
and condemns you another day.
Again you'll be nothing.

(Chorus)
Decay, cut the tongue you speak with to say.
Don't believe, don't believe it.
The wrong way, on a path to somewhere,
Don't feed the selfish mouth of man.

Take it away!

(Chorus 2X)
Decay, cut the tongue you speak with to say.
Don't believe, don't believe it.
The wrong way, on a path to somewhere 
Don't feed the selfish mouth of man.
Decay, cut the tongue you speak with to say.
Don't believe, don't believe it.
The wrong way, on a path to somewhere 
Don't feed the selfish mouth of man.
Decay!---Lyrics submitted by John Williams.
