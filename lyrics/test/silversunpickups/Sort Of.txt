Do you think I'm sort of alive
Should I set these motives aside
Do I feel, well sort of benign
When you walk your body through mine

Whats keeping my tounge tied
I see you when you roll your eyes
I swear any moment you will hear
My spirit explode

When theres fire on the ground
Should I turn my whole world around
When the wheels in the lake
Should I think It's a big mistake
When theres smoke in the sky
Please wake me I don't know why
When your hand stretchs out
It's way beyond, way beyond my reach

Do you think it's sort of a crutch
When you try to move me to touch
Do I shake well sort of but not much
When the shades are summoned and crushed

Whats keeping my tounge tied
I see you when you roll your eyes
I swear any moment you will hear
My spirit explode

When theres fire on the ground
Should I turn my whole world around
When the wheels in the lake
Should I think It's a big mistake
When theres smoke in the sky
Please wake me I don't know why
When your hand stretchs out
It's way beyond, way beyond my reach

Does it make you nervous
When you hear my bones
And make my body with out my soul

Whats keeping my tounge tied
I see you when you roll your eyes
I swear any moment you will hear
My spirit explode

When theres fire on the ground
Should I turn my whole world around
When the wheels in the lake
Should I think It's a big mistake
When theres smoke in the sky
Please wake me I don't know why
When your hand stretchs out
It's way beyond, way beyond my reach---Lyrics submitted by Sean.
