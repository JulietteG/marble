Ok, go
1, 2, 3, 4

Another night alone, a temporary dream
I came in through your window sleepwalking
Standing arm and arm, still so out of reach
Well, there's nowhere left to go
Stay with me, stay with me

Footsteps on the floor, your body's just a haze
In a rhythm of your own, ...
Feeling my body ... to hear you say my name
I've got nowhere left to dream
So I'll just stay awake, stay awake

At last, I'm found
Circle around
Last dance, it's no sound
Nowhere left to go, stay with me
Nowhere left to go, stay with me

Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Circle around
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Circle around
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Circle around

At last, I'm found
Circle around
Last dance, it's no sound
Nowhere left to go, stay with me
Nowhere left to go, stay with me
Nowhere left to go, stay with me
Nowhere left to go, stay with me---
