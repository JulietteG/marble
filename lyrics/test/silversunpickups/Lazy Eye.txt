I've been waiting 
I've been waiting for this moment all my life 
But it's not quite right 

And this 'real' 
It's impossible if possible 
At who's blind word 
So clear but so unheard 

I've been waiting 
I've been waiting for this silence all night long 
It's just a matter of time 

To appear sad 
With the same 'ol decent lazy eye 
Fixed to rest on you 
Aim free and so untrue 

Everyone's so intimately rearranged 
Everyone can focus clearly with such shine 

Everyone's so intimately rearranged 
Everyone so focused clearly with such shine 

Lost and loaded 
Still the same 'ol decent lazy eye 
Straight through your gaze 
That's why i said i relate 
I said we relate 
It's so fun to relate 

It's the room the sun and the sky 
The room the sun and the sky 

I've been waiting 
I've been waiting for this moment...---Lyrics submitted by Juan.
