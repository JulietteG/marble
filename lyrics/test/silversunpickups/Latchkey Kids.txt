You keep dancing around
What you want so bad
Please concentrate, hear me out
You might get caught but if you want
You can keep your fingers crossed

Were outside and free from all tethers
So get off the floor if youre under the weather
Cmon
The Latchkey kids have all come together
So unlock the door, itll make you feel better
Cmon

Weve been sneaking around
But we do it lightly
No more middle school tongues
If you show up unarmed
Be still our beating hearts

Were outside and free from all tethers
So get off the floor if youre under the weather
Whats in store is not so unusual
The latchkey kids have all come together
So unlock the door, itll make you feel better
If its not flesh and blood that leads you on honey
Then unlock the door
Unlock the door and move on

Be still, our beating hearts
Keep your fingers crossed

You keep dancing around
What you want so bad, bad

Were outside and free from all tethers
So get off the floor if youre under the weather
Whats in store is not so unusual
The latchkey kids have all come together
So unlock the door, itll make you feel better
If its not flesh and blood that leads you on honey
Then unlock the door and move on

So get off the floor if youre under the weather
And unlock the door---
