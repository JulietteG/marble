With all the fire set in our eyes 
Without a cornerstone to realize 
That later on we'll build the pyre 
And burn so easily well everyone but me 

And soon we'll sing in better moods 
A sigularity well everyone but you 
They'll pull the nerves out through the pores 
Though bruised so easily the comeback kid's not 
Bleeding 

With words that defied all our social gestures 
No one could've known what the comeback kid did 
No words could describe all the social pressures 
That leads to the time when the comeback kid wins 
And wins 

And now we sing in better moods 
Together whispering well everyone but you 
And later on we built that pyre 
And burned so easily well everyone but me 

With words that defied all our social gestures 
No one could've known what the comeback kid did 
No words could define all the social pressures 
That leads to the time when the comeback kid wins...---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
