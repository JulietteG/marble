Cheer up lady 
I'm really into it 
Candor leaves us far behind 
Let's see how twisted we can be 

Soak up pleasantries 
Of mildew and stitchery 
The needlepoint has set designs 
To show how easy it can be when we 

Waste it on 
We waste it on 
We waste it on 

Let's start making 
Maps out of all the dead skin 
That maybe causing false alarms 
It might be peeling much too quickly 

Clean up with me 
The homemade surgeries 
My veneers sink into you 
And show how twisted we can be when we 

Waste it on 
We waste it on 
We waste it on 

On sullen meadows that will fit right in 
With lisping rivers that will fit right in 
With mountain ranges through matted lenses 
That will fit right in connect and dissect so we 

With all your meadows they'll still see right in 
With all your rivers they'll still see right in 
No mountain ranges will stop them sensing 
And they'll see right in and see right through cuz we 

Waste it on 
We waste it on 
We waste it on 
We waste it on---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
