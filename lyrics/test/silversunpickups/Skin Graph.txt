Little lights
Are over exposing the highlight
Marks on the floor
When aligned right
Lead to the door of a place that
Seemed somewhat exposed till now

I'm back
And punching the air
A sneak attack
To disrupt the smear on the laid tracks
I left when I broke off the pavement
I still should be on I suppose

In a new skin I'm ready to spill
What I'm never willing to share
I disable the muscles and bones
So they won't try
To walk on the road

Now I stand here
With nothing to hide like the new born
Hungry and wild
But the ground I want to explore
Doesn't feel like before

Cause all I think about is why
The skin I'm in feels ordinary
The things that you might like
Don't grow inside of me

The skin's alive; it's leaving!
The skin's alive; it's moving!
The skin's alive; it's leaving!
The skin's alive; it moves me

I want to be next to you
While your covering, covering is soft
And I try to crawl up next to you
Your covering becomes leather

Cause all I think about is why
The skin I'm in feels ordinary
The things that you might like
Don't grow inside of me

The skin's alive; it's leaving!
The skin's alive; it's moving!
The skin's alive; it's leaving!
The skin's alive; it moves me---Lyrics submitted by Connor S Tymon.
