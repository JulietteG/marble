Someone long gone
Said to stay calm
Keep your head on
If you need love

Hide your cradle
And a headstone
In the watermark
When the sea comes

Help me swallow up
All of your better nature
Please can you summon up
All of your better nature

When your mind's off
In a tight knot
Can you feel caught
If you need love

Help me swallow up
All of your better nature
Please can you summon up
All of your better nature

Hold on
I think you're wrong

Help me swallow up
All of your better nature
Please can you summon up
All of your better nature

Better nature
Better nature...---
