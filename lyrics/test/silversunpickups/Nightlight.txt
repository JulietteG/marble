When the wind, behind our eyes swell
Starring down all, who generalize well
A chemical change of the spirit
Will be the exchange for our visit

Putting more makeup on the masks that we wear
Turning our nightlights on in the daytime to scare

If we say that (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out
If it's a game, well? (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out

If we enter, through the front door
With the keys we stole the night before
Now we have right to be the masters
Of the tangles of disaster

Ladies and gentlemen its time to unveil
If this is the moment now to ask "do we dare?"

If we say that (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out
If it's a game, well? (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out
If we survive this (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out
So delegate it! (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out

Turning our nightlights on in the daytime to scare
If this is the moment now to ask "do we dare?"

If we say that (WE WANT IT)
If we say that (WE WANT IT)
If we say that (WE WANT IT)
If we say that (WE WANT IT, WE WANT IT)

If we say that (WE WANT IT)
If it's a game, well? (WE WANT IT)
If we survive this (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out
If we say that (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out
If it's a game, well?(WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out
If we survive this (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out
So delegate it! (WE WANT IT)
We only want it with the lights out---
