Whisper softly in my ear
Make my dreams come true
Dancin' lightly, make the mood inside my mind
Above my pillow smiling brightly down at you.

Your name's always on my mind
And in my heart it's true
Come delight me, in the dark inside my love
Beside my pillow now, I'll give it all to you

I don't care if you don't love me like you say
Cause' I'm gonna love you anyway
And I don't care if you don't love me like you say
Cause I'm gonna love you anyway

Take my heart down off the shelf
Use your love as the key
Please unlock me from the pain, to which I'm bound
You won't regret the time you shared your love with me

I don't care if you don't love me like you say
Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
And I don't care if you don't love me like you say
Cause I'm gonna love you anyway

If you don't go, I'll try to show you all the love you need
You'll never know all the love you need
Girl you should know, all the love you need
