I feel lonely, lo lo lo lo lonely,
Your the one and only,
That makes me feel so good.

I feel lonely, lo lo lo lo lonely,
Your the one and only,
That makes my dreams come true.

All across the universe,
Every boy and every girl,
Is looking for this thing called love.
So why do all the other guys,
Got pretty women by their side,
Some guys really can't complain.
Every night I lay awake and cry,
I'm looking for someone to stand by my side.

I feel lonely, lo lo lo lo lonely,
Your the one and only,
That makes me feel so good.

I feel lonely, lo lo lo lo lonely,
Your the one and only,
That makes my dreams come true.

I feel lonely, so lonely.

It's not easy to fall in love,
So I pray to god above,
Lord I need a helping hand.
And mister DJ plays this song,
I felt lonely for so long,
Is this my SOS for love?
All the time I got it on my vine,
Someone to hold me tight is hard to find.

I feel lonely, lo lo lo lo lonely,
Your the one and only,
That makes me feel so good.

I feel lonely, lo lo lo lo lonely,
Your the one and only,
That makes my dreams come true.

I feel lonely, so lonely.

I feel, I feel, I feel so low.
I feel, I feel, I feel so low.
I feel, I feel, I feel so lonely girl. 

I feel, I feel, I feel so low.
I feel, I feel, I feel so low.
I feel, I feel, I feel so lonely girl.
