As a young girl,
Louie Vuitton.
With your mother,
On a sandy lawn.

As a sophmore,
with reggaton
and the linens
you're sitting on.

Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?

Do you want to fuck?
Like you know I do.
Like you know I do. 

But this feels so unnatural
Peter Gabriel too.
But this feels so unnatural
Peter Gabriel.

Can you stay up
to see the dawn?
In the colors
of Benneton?

Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want ta ?
Like you know I do.
Like you know I do.

This feels so unnatural
Peter Gabriel too.
But this feels so unnatural
Peter Gabriel too.

Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want ta?
Like you know I do.
Like you know I do-o-o-o-o-o-o-o.---Lyrics submitted by sydney.
