Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on his honors finger
Oh oh oh

A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily white hand
Showed no fear shed seen the thing
In the young mens wing at Sloan-Kettering

CHORUS
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh!

His honor drove southward seeking exotica
Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh oh oh

I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other halfs at the bottom of the sea

CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Akela.
