I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself
I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself

Oh I was made to live without you
But Im never going to understand, never understand
Oh I was born to live without you
But Im never going to understand, never understand

Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up, full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier thats going down

I thought it over and drew the curtain
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself
And Ill only consider it as you played the hallelujah
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself

If youve been made to serve the master youd
Be frightened by the hokum and be frightened by the night
Could Ive been made to serve the master
Well Im never going to understand, never understand

Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up, full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier thats going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up, full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier thats going down

Hold me in your everlasting arms---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
