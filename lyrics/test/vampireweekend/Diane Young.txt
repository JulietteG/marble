You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves
Id gone to find some better wheels
Four or five meters running round the bend
When the government agents surround you again
If Diane Young wont change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Out of control but youre playing a role
You think you can go to the eighteenth hole
Well, you flip-flop the day of the championship
Try to go it alone, you roll for a bit
If Diane Young wont change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Baby baby baby baby right on (X2)
Baby baby baby its a light on
Baby baby baby its a lifetime
Baby baby baby baby right on
Time (x5)
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Let em go
If Diane Young wont change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Irish and proud baby naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep holding it tight
Til youre driving off in the black of the night
If Diane Young wont change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Baby baby baby baby right on (X2)
Baby baby baby its a light on
Baby baby baby its a lifetime
Baby baby baby baby right on
Time (x5)
Baby baby baby baby right on time

Nobody knows what the future holds on
Said its bad enough just getting old
Live my life, they say its too fast
You know I love the past, cause I hate suspense
If Diane Young wont change your mind
Baby baby baby baby right on time---
