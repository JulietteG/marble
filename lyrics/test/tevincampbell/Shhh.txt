Yo what's up?
Leave your name and a brief message and
I'll be sure to get back with you-Peace
Beep! "Tevin I love you"

CHORUS: 
Shh break it down 
I don't want nobody else to hear the sound
This love is a private affair
Interupt the flow, no u better not dare
Shhh we got to break it down

In the day time? Uh, uh, 
I think not
I'de rather do you after school like some homework
Am I gettin' you hot
In my bedroom? No!
Cause then we have to stop
I'd rather wait till everyone's fast asleep
Then do it in th kitchen on the table top(OOOO!)
We got to break it on down 

CHORUS

Candlelight? No! I don't think so
The crackle of the flame will just spoil the flow
Besides, I can be your fire, baby 
Drippin' all over like a ball of wax relax and let go

CHORUS

I'm here to do work, baby so what you here to do?
I know you got somethin' special on your mind 
Is that ture?(yeah) I'm here to do work baby(do it) 
And i wanna do it with you 
You say you wanna slow jam?
Then listen up, girl 
I wanna whisper music in your ear that'll rock your
Rock your, rock your world
Oww, whats my name, love? Tevin.
I'll ask you again and again and again and again
'Till you scream... scream,scream and oooo yeah
Shhhh. break it down
(Break it down) whats my name baby?
(Hear the sound) this is a secret 
(Private affair) nobody'll know (better not dare)
Oh yeah, ya got to break it on down and down and down
OOOOWWW
you got to break it on down
If you with this then let me hear you say-

CHORUS

I'm ready are you?---Lyrics submitted by suzan.
