A dedication to all the Refugees world wide
one time

Say, Say, Say
I remember, when we used to say
In a government yard in Brookyln
Oba, Observin' the crookedness
As it mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, good friends we've lost
Along the waaaaay
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
To my peeps who past away

No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Say, say, say,
Hey little sista
Don't shead no tears
No woman no cry
Say, say, say

I remember, when we used to rock
In a project yard in Jersey
And little Georgey would make the fire light
As stolen cars pass through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store
For root paper and brew (brew)
My drinks, my only remedy, for pain of losing family
But while I'm gone shorty

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
The gunman's in the house tonight
But everything is gonna be alright

oh, ah, oh ah, oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah, oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah, oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah, oh, ah, oh ah

No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Hey little sista 
Don't shead not tears
No woman no cry
Say, say, say

I remember when we used to say
In a government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, Observin' the hypocrites
As the mingle with people we meet
Good friends we had, good friends we've lost
Along the way, Hey
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say

No woman no cry
No woman no cry
Say, say, say
Hey little sista
Don't shead no tears
No woman no cry
To my peeps who past away

oh, ah, oh ah, oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah, oh, ah, oh ah---Lyrics submitted by Yenesa.
