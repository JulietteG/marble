Well, the morning came like a freight train
Bearing down on me from a thousand miles of rail
Well it came and gone and kept rolling on
Laying up all night with my tear-stained sheet as my veil

I dont want to see you again, I dont want to feel your breath
As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
And I dont want the keys to our door, I dont live there anymore
And Ill do my best just to forget the dreams weve dreamt

Well, the morning came with the pouring rain
And I felt just as empty as a pail
With the evidence and your crime confessed
Dont seem right that its me that spent a night in jail

I dont want to see you again, I dont want to feel your breath
As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
And I dont want the keys to our door, I dont live there anymore
And Ill do my best just to forget the dreams Ive dreamt

If you feel a chill in the air
Its my spirit hanging somewhere
If you ever get scared
Look on the Brightside
You got a new life

Now the evenings come and Im all alone
And I cant tell if silence is my former friend
Well Im holding on but I aint too strong
I gotta get some rest before that train come back round the bend

I dont want to see you again, I dont want to feel your breath
As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
And I dont want the keys to our door, I dont live there anymore
And Ill do my best just to forget the dreams weve dreamt
Dreams weve dreamt.---
