It aint no jive 
I was burning alive 
Whenever you walk in the room 
It happened so quickly 
I was feeling so sickly 
Like the lover who lost his own muse 

The sharks in the tank or 
The men in the bank 
He wants my money to loan 
I cant understand 
What the hell is his plan 
While he aint even got a home 
Aint got a home 

Girl on a street 
With holes in her feet 
Looks through the eyes of a cloud 
She dont look amazed 
Shes feeling kind of sad 
So I just walk around 

I reassess, shes down on her luck 
Shes reading a book full of lies 
I dont know when ill be coming home baby 
But I sure sympathize 

Can sympathize 
Can sympathize 

Angels spread their wings 
On all the dirty things 
But you 
Do 

She drops to the floor 
Her heads by the door 
Her bible is by her side 
Heaven is calling 
The new world is falling 
And she aint got a single person left 

To confide 
No one to confide 
No one to confide 
Ah to confide 

I sympathize 
Can Sympathize---Lyrics submitted by C.
