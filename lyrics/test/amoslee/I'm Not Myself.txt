And if you wanna leave me
Baby go ahead
I know you don't believe me
Oh when I finally said

That I'm not myself
When I'm with you
It takes and breaks
My heart in two

I'm half a mile from Jersey
The headlights on the shore
You know how much it hurts me
I never been this deep before

And I'm not myself
When I'm with you
It takes and breaks
My heart in two

And oh...

Does anybody have a clue
How hard I worked at loving you

And I'm not myself
When I'm with you
It takes and breaks
My heart in two---Lyrics submitted by C.
