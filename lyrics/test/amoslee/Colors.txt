Yesterday I got lost in the circus
Feeling like such a mess.
Now I'm down,
and just hanging on the corner.
I cant help but reminisce.

(chorus)
Cause when your gone
All the colors fade
When your gone
No New Years day parade
Your gone
Colors seem to fade

Your momma called she said,
that your downstairs cryin',
feeling like such a mess.
Yeah, i hear 
ya in the background ballin'.
What happened to your sweet summertime dress?
I know we all... 
we all got our faults.
We get locked in our vaults,
and we stay....

(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
