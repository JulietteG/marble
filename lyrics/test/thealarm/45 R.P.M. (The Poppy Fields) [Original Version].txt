A spiral scratch
Gave me my life back
A vinyl solution
Ended my confusion
I heard a voice- in the noise
Pollution- Oh, oh

45 RPM- 45
45 RPM- 45
45 RPM- Keep on running to the end
45 RPM, RPM, RPM

The two sevens clashed
Kick started my life soundtrack
A sonic revolution
Broke the disillusion
I heard a voice in the noise- pollution

45 RPM- 45, 45
45 RPM- 45, 45
45 RPM- Keep on running to the end
45 RPM, RPM, revolutions per minute!

(Interlude)
45 RPM- Keep on running to the end
45 RPM- Keep on running to the end!

[Solo]
Forty- Five- RPM
I heard a voice in the noise pollution
Forty- Five- RPM
Keep on running to the end
Forty- Five- RPM
The two sevens clashed-
Kick started my life soundtrack!
Forty- Five- RPM
45 RPM, RPM, RPM!---Lyrics submitted by Danny.
