Stand tall for the beast of America.
Lay down like a naked dead body,
keep it real for the people workin' overtime,
they can't stay living off the governments dime.

Stand tall for the people of America.
Stand tall for the man next door,
we are free in the land of America,
we aint goin' down like this.

I will be right to you,
