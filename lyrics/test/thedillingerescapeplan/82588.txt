Fallen angel how you've changed
Poison runs through your veins
You were never a saint but now you're a sin
Spoiled rotten from within
Who clipped your wings so useless?
Cut them yourself?
Chewed off your own?
Good thinking
You were coming apart and I thought I could help you
Through the fever
Not the first one
Not the last one
I'm not sorry for you
I remember a time when everything that you knew I thought I already knew in my mind
And I thought you knew the same
I know truth will set you free
Cracked and crazy baby---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
