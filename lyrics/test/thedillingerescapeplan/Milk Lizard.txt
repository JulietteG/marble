My thick tongue hangs down low to the ground
Licking up the sweat coming off of her heels
She wants my teeth to wear
She wants my hell to bear
Well missy it's a lock for load
If you wanna grind hips don't do it alone
Don't save no dance no not for me
Just cut me out

You crept up like a disease looking like a girl only trying to be saved
Your heart was trying to bleed and you're taking the right road if you're talking to me

Well you thought you'd tear my skin from bone
Just cause it was cold and you needed a coat
Don't tease me just start digging the hole start digging
Oh you're getting so sleepy tonight
And you wanna go home but you don't have a ride
No time just taste won't touch for free
My salt your sweet

You crept up like a disease looking like a girl only trying to be saved
Your heart was trying to bleed and you're taking the right road if you're talking to me

And you were there
And I was every question that never had an answer
I see right through you
We never even noticed that
There always was a reason
That we were never meant to be left alone

My thick tongue hangs down low to the ground
Licking up the sweat coming off of her heels
She wants my teeth to wear
She wants my hell to bear
Well missy it's a lock for load
If you wanna grind hips don't do it alone
Don't save no dance no not for me
Just cut me out

And you were there
And I was every question that never had an answer
I see right through you
We never even noticed that
There always was a reason
That we were never meant to be left alone

This feels like neverending---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
