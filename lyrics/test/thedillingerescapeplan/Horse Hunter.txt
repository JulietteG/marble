Stumbling over dead forgotten
Catch you and the secret falls away
Falls away
You were drunken from delusion
Slipped and so the secret fell away
Fell away
I see you
Tears in your eyes
Yeah this party is a bore and you're the joke
Me and you
We are the light
Sit with me
Give me your hand
You should go your way
You are no friend of mine
Life still lives on lives
Red sea inside these walls
Commerce is your god
Cannibalistic flies
Monarch of your womb
Messiah of your thighs
How sacred is the web that must be spun
Your taste is on the tip of every tongure
Down, lets stay down
Take me all the way
All the way down
Shout, shout out loud
Make us proud for days
All the way down
Give to fire
Beyond the soul desire---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
