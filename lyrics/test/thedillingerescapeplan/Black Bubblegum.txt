Got so much salt from your lies poured into me
You didn't see yourself dead already
So full of with every breath you breathe
But you forget that in your fairy tale I'm the wolf
All this attention got you thinking that you're a queen
You think that everything you're doing isn't a dream
Long as it feels right

I had gotten frozen by the way you walked
By the love that you gave by that look on your face
It's a coverup (repeat)

I know everything
You're made for letter fame
Regret is part of your name
There's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted to feel
It's what you're dying to feel

Check out your face on the wall
Like what you see?
I'm sure you see yourself oh so unique
You're just a sucker for the flame of the week
But you forget that in your fairy tale I'm the wolf
All this attention got you thinking you were a queen
You thought that everything in life you want should be free
Nothing is what you think

I had gotten frozen by the way you walked
By the love that you gave by that look on your face
It's a coverup
i know everything (repeat)

You're made for letter fame
Regret is part of your name
There's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted to feel
It's what you're dying to feel (repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
