You are only the faded star of my design
Junked out lost potential and crazy from your questions answered
Walk forth
You're the fulfillment of a fallacy
A creature from fantasy
Don't think that you ever knew me
Don't you ever see
We are forever entwined stuck in a play we can't get out of
Don't you ever see
Won't you ever see
You and I will never be able to end this
We are forever entwined stuck in a play we can't leave
You say someday we can start up again
Without a plan no sign of the pressure
I say you're crazy
I hope you see my face in the mirror
You will never learn
You're forever dead to me
Won't you ever see
Your shadow?---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
