My darling, 
You're stalling now.
Well don't you know where I've been?

There's fall out, 
There is no doubt,
Where this is all gonna end.

Don't fall in love,
Don't fall in love,
Don't fall in love,
With me.

It's a new trend.
Some kind of Hollywood romance.
Well isn't that what you mean?

The factory,
it's shining,
but it is not what it seems.


Don't fall in love,
Don't fall in love,
No, don't fall in love,
With me.

Where does it hit you,
When you're alone?
Do you let it get you?
Let it follow you home?

Oh, how would you
Ever know?

These buildings
have ceilings.
Well, there is no mistake.

We're locked in,
A beginning.
Well, do you know what this takes?

Don't fall in love,
Don't fall in love,
No, don't fall in love,
With me.

Ah, don't fall in love,
No, don't fall in love,
Whoa, don't fall in love,
With me.---Lyrics submitted by Robin.
