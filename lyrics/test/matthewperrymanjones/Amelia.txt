Sad like a melody
Full like a symphony
Striking a chord
Standing here looking blind
I stumble around to find
My way through your door
Do you want to know why?
Do you want to know why?
Hungry as starving fire
Killing to feed desire
What do you do?
Were born into vanity
Bones feeling everything
Are we alone?
Do you want to know why?
Cause I want to know why?

CHORUS x2
Say it Amelia
Say its true
That lifes worth all the dying we do
Amelia
A beautiful melody
Sung by a symphony
You're striking a chord---Lyrics submitted by ceci.
