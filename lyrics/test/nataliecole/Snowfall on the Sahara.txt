Your love, like wine. Tasting sweeter to me every day
Your kiss, devine. And it melts the cold inside away
All of my life, I've been waiting for a love like this
And now, that you're here romance is just a second away.
It's gonna stay

'Til the snow falls on the Sahara, 'Til the sun freezes over, 'Til the
Mojave red turns into blue
'Til my lungs get tired of breathing, and my heart stops it's beating,
then I'll stop loving you.

And in the dark, when there's no one calling out your name.
Well I'll hold you so tight, and I'll whisper to you once again, and again

'Til the snow falls on the Sahara, 'Til the sun freezes over,
'Til the Mojave red turns into blue.
When the music's no longer playing and the faithless start praying,
I'll stop loving you.

When the snow falls on the Sahara (uh huh), 'Til the sun freezes over,
'Til the Mojave red turns into blue (That's a long Time) When my lungs
get tired of breathing (oh) and my heart stops it's beating

I'll stop loving you.
I don't want to waste a single heartbeat
And sometimes my words get in the way
But I hear your love just fine. Just Fine
And it's gonna take a long time

'Til the snow falls on the Sahara, 'Til the sun freezes over
'Til the Mojave red turns into blue (That's a long time)
When the music's no longer playing, and the faithless start praying
I'll stop loving you, oh. uh huh uh huh (When the snow falls on the
Sahara, and the sun freezes over, when the Mojave red turns into blue)
I'll be loving you, baby. (When my lungs get tired of breathing and my
heart stops it's beating) I'll stop loving you.---
