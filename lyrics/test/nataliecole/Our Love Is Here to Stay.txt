It's very clear 
Our love is here to stay 
Not for a year 
But ever and a day 

The radio, and the telephone 
And the movies that we know 
May just be passing fancies 
And in time may go... 

But, oh, my dear 
Our love is here to stay 
Together we're 
Going a long, long way 

In time the Rockies may tumble 
Gibraltar may crumble 
They're only made of clay 
But, our love is here 
To stay 

In time the Rockies may tumble 
Gibraltar may crumble 
They're only made of clay 
But, our love is here 
Our love is here 
Our love is here to stay---
