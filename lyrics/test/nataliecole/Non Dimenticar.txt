Non Dimenticar,
Means don't forget your
my darling
don't forget to be
all you mean to me

Non Dimenticar,
My love is like a star
my darling
Shining bright and clean
just because you're here
please do not forget

That our lips have meant
and I've held you tightly

Was it dreams or though
my heart felt is ...
or just a night here

Non Dimenticar,
although you travel far
my darling
it's my heart you owe
so I'll wait alone
Non Dimenticar...---
