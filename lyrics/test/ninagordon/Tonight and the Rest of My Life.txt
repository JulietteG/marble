Down to the Earth I fell
With dripping wings
Heavy things won't fly
And the sky might catch on fire
And burn the axis of the world that's why
I prefer a sunless sky
To the glittering and stinging in my eyes

(chorus)
Oh I feel so alive
This is all I wanna feel tonight
Oh I feel so alive
Tonight and the rest of my life

Gleaming in the dark sea
I'm as light as air
Floating there breahtlessly
When the dream disloves I open 
Up my eyes I realize that 
Everything is shoreless sea 
A weightlessness is passing over me

(chorus)

Everything is waves and stars
The universe is resting in my arms

(chorus X 2)---Lyrics submitted by Bridget.
