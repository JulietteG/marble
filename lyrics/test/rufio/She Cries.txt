Gone again she said
heading for the longest road
One too many times
hes beaten you down to the bone
so you sail away
into the unknown
Stay away he said
don't ever come back home
Cry away
the days i find so long
on your own
You stay away

Stay away

Beaten from the pain
that he left inside your heart
fallen in the way
your whole life has fallen apart

So you sail away
into the unknown
stay away he said
don't ever come back home
cry away
the days i find so long
on your own
you stay away

Alone
she cries
bruise and hate inside
new love
new life
without that one loser who once said
here's your kiss goodbye

See this is real
She doesn't feel

Lonely hearts
shattered dreams
there's nothing better in this place
nothing but
memories
in her mind

So you sail away
into the unknown
stay away he said
don't ever come back home
cry away
the days go by so long
on your own
you stay away

Alone
she cries
bruise and hate inside
new love
new life
without that one loser who once said
here's your kiss goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Sin.
