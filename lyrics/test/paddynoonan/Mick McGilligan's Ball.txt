Michael Magilligan one fine day 
Got a lot of money from the USA 
All through the death of his uncle Joe 
He got a million and a half or so 
Says Magilligan "I'll give a fancy ball 
Down at the old ancestral hall"
Invited the neighbours, ev'ryone 
For to have some music and some rare old fun

Chorus 
All went down to Mick Magilligan's Ba---ll 
Where they had to tear the paper off the wa---ll 
To make room for all the people in the ha---ll 
Oh the girls and boys made a devil of a noise

All went down to Mick Magilligan's Ba---ll 
Where they had to tear the paper off the wa---ll 
To make room for all the people in the ha---ll 
Oh the girls and boys made a devil of a noise 
At Mick Magilligan's Ball 

Fluters and fiddlers near and far 
Drumming on the moleskin made a lovely sound 
They blew a gale on the old trombone 
Then reeled and rollicked to the piper's drone 
When they finished with the whiskey, beer and wine 
They took a hand in "Auld Lang Syne"
There ne'er was the like, I do declare 
Ask that grand old Hooley down in sweet Kildare 
When they 

Chorus 
All went down to Mick Magilligan's Ba---ll 
Where they had to tear the paper off the wa---ll 
To make room for all the people in the ha---ll 
Oh the girls and boys made a devil of a noise 
At Mick Magilligan's B A double L
