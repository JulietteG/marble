(with Zendaya)

Here we go now!
Here we go no-no-no-no-n-no-n-no-now!

Yo, yo look at me
Walkin' down the runway, like a V.I.P.
Just doin' my thing, with my girl Z
Yeah ya b-b-b-best, believe me

Hey B, I'm doin' my thing
And when I say "What?", lemme hear you sing
We got the moves, we talk the talk
And now we're gonna show 'em we can walk the walk!

When we up in the club
It's easy to see
That we got style in our veins
'Cause fashion's what we breathe

When we up on the runway
We doing it right, right
R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-right!

Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite...

Yo, yo we got them moves
Walkin' down the street, in our dancin' shoes
High-top's on, and I'm ready to roll
My super style, out of control

Hold up, I got somethin' to say
Our fashion sense's a-okay
Walkin' your way, so you better look grace
We're double dot of sugar and spice

When we walkin' like this
Everybody knows
That we got fashion in our blood
From our head to our toes

Nobody will argue
We lookin' so right, right
R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-right

Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!

Walk, walk, work it right
Fashion is my kryptonite
(Here we go now!)

Walk, walk, work it right
Fashion is my kryptonite
(Here we go now!)

Walk, walk, work it right
Fashion is my kryptonite
(Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go now!)
Walk, walk, work it right
Fashion is my kryptonite

Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!
Fashion is my kryptonite!

Walk, walk, work it right
Fashion is my kryptonite
(Fashion is my kryptonite)

Walk, walk, work it right
Fashion is my kryptonite
(Fashion is my kryptonite)

Walk, walk, work it right
Fashion is my kryptonite
(Fashion is my kryptonite)

Walk, walk, work it right
Fashion is my kryptonite
Fashion is my kryptonite... ---
