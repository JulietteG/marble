It always seems to hard to talk about it
There's something about the way you 
Make me feel
It lets me know that I can't do without it
It lets me know that love is oh so real

And I love
The way you love me
And I love
The way you do
And I love 
That way you love me
and for always my love 
Is forever true

Life is supreme
The sun is always shining
Nothing goes wrong whenever 
You're around
Whatever I do 
There's something there reminding
Of the beautiful friend in you
that I've found

I'm never alone
You're there when I need you
To keep me from all other thing
I fear
I want you to know
That I could never leave you
And it makes me feel good to know that you
Are near

I love
the way you love me
I love 
the way you do
I love 
The way you love me
And for always my love 
Is forever true---Lyrics submitted by tara.
