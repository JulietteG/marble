Never thought I would be
Be the one standing here
All alone twiddling my thumbs
Got my shoes, got my bag, got my makeup
Got my rag on my head, my hair is a mess
I rather be ugly than stand here lonely and depressed
Waiting for you and your promises
That you made and couldn''t keep
Let me compose myself, I got carried away
You're not to blame
It's me, it's me, it's me
Maybe it's me
Oh, it's me
Oh, it's me

I open my heart, I open my heart to you
Gotta blame me, gotta blame me
Le me compose myself, gotta compose myself
Nobody's to blame, nobody's to blame

Oh, it's me
Oh, it's me

And nobody put a gun into my head
And told me to fall in love with you

Me, it's me

And nobody put a gun into my head
And told me to fall in love with you

Me, it's me
Nobody, but me

And nobody put a gun in my head
And told me to fall into love with you

Gotta blame me, gotta blame me
Nobody told me love
Don't love nobody but if so---
