This is the Face, the Face of the Planet!
Dress up your Buddhas? give Jesus a tie, 
Dance like a voodoo, the whole planet is high, 
Cry out like monkeys, greasepaint Muhammed, 
This is the Face, the Face of the Planet!

This is the Face, the Face of the Planet!
Dress up your Buddhas? give Jesus a tie, 
Dance like a voodoo, the whole planet is high, 
Cry out like monkeys, greasepaint Muhammed,
This is the Face, the Face of the Planet!
Dress up your Buddhas? give Jesus a tie, 
Dance like a voodoo, the whole planet is high, 
Cry out like monkeys, greasepaint Muhammed, 
This is the Face, the Face of the Planet!

This is the Face, the Face of the Planet!
Dress up your Buddhas? give Jesus a tie, 
Dance like a voodoo, the whole planet is high, 
Cry out like monkeys, greasepaint Muhammed, 
This is the Face, the Face of the Planet!
Dress up your Buddhas? give Jesus a tie, 
Dance like a voodoo, the whole planet is high, 
Cry out like monkeys, greasepaint Muhammed, 
This is the Face, the Face of the Planet!---Lyrics submitted by juan.
