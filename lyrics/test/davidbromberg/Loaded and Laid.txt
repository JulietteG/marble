Folks, you know I finally figured out just what's wrong with me
I need to get loaded and laid
That's the only decent way that I can foresee
to make it through the cold night ahead
You might think that's funny coming from a man my age
but if you think I'm jiving you, sweetheart, you can meet me backstage
I finally figured out just what's wrong with me
Oh, I need to get loaded and laid
Yeah, I finally figured out just what my main problem is
I need to be ravaged and rubbed
You can forget all about the need for restraint
I wanna get my sweet little joint
I tried persuasion, booze, and assault
and the way Marin County women look, it ain't even half my fault
I finally figured out what my main problem is
Oh, I need to be ravaged and rubbed
(yes I do)
Folks you know, this thing's been bothering me now for quite a few days
I wanna be tortured and teased
I know San Francisco women must have a thousand ways
to keep a New York boy all sweatin' and pleased
You can drag out your fake fur, your lashes and lace
you can smear guacamole all over my face
There's a thing been bothering me now for quite a few days
Hey, I wanna be tortured and teased
Folks you know I finally figured out just what my main problem is
I need to get loaded and laid
Believe me I wouldn't have even brought the subject up
except it's been up on its own now for days
I don't care if you wanna stand, stoop, or sit
Just don't think about stopping, child, until I beg you to quit
I finally figured out just what's wrong with me
Yeah, I need to get loaded and laid
Yeah, I wanna be tortured and teased
Child, I need to get loaded and laid---Lyrics submitted by Austin.
