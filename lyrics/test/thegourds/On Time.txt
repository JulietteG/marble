I gave it a try, but they're kinda hard to understand

Working on goin, right up til we go,
Hot springs jenny, river and the know.
Color me ready, never let it show
Keep every thing on time,
Gotta keep everything on time

Turn-up green river, steady eddy as she goes,
Tie your schiffe, round the stage at our sham-bo
Moving and shakin, way after close.
Keep everything on time,
Gotta keep everything on time.

(Harp solo)

Turn-up green river, where have ya go
Turn-up green, lets move to shore, (have no idea really)
You can keep everything on time,
You can keep everything on time.

Turn-up green river, steady eddy as she goes,
Tie your schiffe, round the stage at our sham-bo
Moving and shakin, way after close.
Keep everything on time,
You can keep everything on time.---Lyrics submitted by brock.
