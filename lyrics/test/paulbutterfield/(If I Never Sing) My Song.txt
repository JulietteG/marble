If I never sing my song,
And never sing it strong,
How are you to know,
How my feelings go;

Forgetting foolish pride,
To let you see inside,
A pure and simple thing,
The beauty love can bring,
If I never sing my song?

If Id never known your touch,
And not be moved so much,
I might have gone my way,
Without knowing what Id lost.

Something turned me around,
Released me from the ground,
And taught me how to fly,
Up to heavens high,
A place where I belong.

And, oh, youve given life to me,
And you taught me love the way its meant to be.
And, oh, the world seems clear now,
Just holding you, loving you, and knowing you.

If I never sang my song,
It might have all gone wrong.
I might have lost my place,
Suspended out in space.

Thank god you heard my sound,
And turned my life around.
With love you brought me home,
To you, where I belong,
And Im glad I sang my song.

Im so glad I sang my song.
