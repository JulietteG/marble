Breaking down, and days came longer
There's the other class dragons chasing you around
Sit around on silver just stream on the smoke
Is rising over your thoughts and your tears

Watch over you, watch and fall down
You knock a boulder all over the ground
You get up, get up, you get up, you get up

Some things let go
At least for now all these tears past the problems
Stop listen to new words from around as you're round
And all the captives you burn, is burning out

Watch as the flowers, thrones and winds
Spills close as a way, spills away
Get up, you get up, get up

I will love you
And I will love you---
