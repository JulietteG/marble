Stop hanging around my window
Stop hanging around my door
Hey, don't you know that my heart has grown cold
And I can never be what you want me to be
Is your love too dangerous?
I don't want a broken heart again

Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
I don't want a broken heart again

Love did me wrong
Now you want me to believe
You won't hurt me
Love let me down
Now you want me to believe
You're for real

You want me to let go
You want me to lose control
You want me to let go
Well, I don't want to lose control

Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
I don't want a broken heart again

Too scared to trust
But it's not because of you
It's just what I've been through
Love hurt me bad
And I don't want to be a fool for you

You want me to let go
You want me to lose control
You want me to let go
Well, I don't want to lose control

Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?

It's taken me a long time to feel better, babe
I only just begun to feel my heart again
And all the while I know
I don't want you to go away

I'm not afraid of you
I'm just buying my time
I'm not afraid of you

Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
I don't want a broken heart again

Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
Is your love too dangerous?
I don't want a broken heart again---
