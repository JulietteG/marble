I wonder what you'll take from me today
Sanity or just take my breath away
It's hard to say
Impossible for me to tell
We're always walking on eggshells
Who your going to be from day to day, today

(Chorus)
I wish that we could go back
To where we were before
But I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore

Wonder why it is that you don't see
What you've changed since we first met
and how much that its killing me
i know that i will always miss
the butterflies of our first kiss
and how you used to smile so easily

(Chorus)

Its too hard to keep pretending
Its too hard to ignore
i dont think i love you anymore

I'm sorry,I'm sorry 
I never thought that it will come to this 
I know I'll never get back 
To how we were before 
Cuz' I know that I don't love you anymore 

It's too hard to keep pretending 
It's too hard to ignore 
But I know that I don't love you anymore,anymore 

I'm sorry...---Lyrics submitted by Marissa.
