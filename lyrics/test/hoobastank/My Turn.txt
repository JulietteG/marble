I have been patiently waiting in line
Watching everyone passing me by
And I can't seem to figure out
When's it gonna be my turn?

I'm sick and tired of paying my dues
Played the game 'til the end and I lose
So can somebody tell me
When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?

Yesterday, I've learned from, tomorrow is uncertain
So why can't I just make my turn today?

I've always followed and played by the rules
But the prize goes to those who aren't due
Still nobody can answer me
When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?

Yesterday, I've learned from, tomorrow is uncertain
So why can't I just make my turn today?
'Cause yesterday, I've burned from, tomorrow is uncertain
So why can't I just make my turn today?

When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?

When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?

Whoa, when's it gonna be my turn?
Whoa, when's it gonna be my turn?

Yesterday, I've learned from, tomorrow is uncertain
So why can't I just make my turn today?
'Cause yesterday, I've burned from, tomorrow is uncertain
So why can't I just make my turn today?

When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
