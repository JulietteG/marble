I'm chasing time
Looking for a beat
Open your eyes
And repeat after me

You try so hard to find a rhythm in your heartbeat
The less you know the more you want
To try to justify the secrets of your lifetime
In the end he'll come for us

So take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for melodies
Take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for melodies

Break to break it down
Will I find clarity
On a hotel floor
When I fall asleep

You try so hard to find a rhythm in your heartbeat
The less you know the more you want
To try to justify the secrets of your lifetime
In the end he'll come for us

So take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for melodies
Take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for melodies

I'm looking for a safe way out
Cause I am in the habit of breaking young girls' hearts
I've been looking for a safe way out (safe way out)
Cause I am in the habit of breaking young girls' hearts
I've been looking for a safe way out (safe way out)
Cause I am in the habit of breaking young girls' hearts

You try so hard to find a rhythm in your heartbeat
The less you know the more you want
To try to justify the secrets of your lifetime
In the end he'll come for us

So take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for melodies
Take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for melodies

I've been looking for a safe way out (safe way out)
(cause I'm in the habit of breaking young girls' hearts)
(safe way out)---Lyrics submitted by clayton.
