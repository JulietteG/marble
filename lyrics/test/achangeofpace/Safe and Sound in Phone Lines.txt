I found out what I've been missing
You are enough to keep me wondering through the nights that I've spent
Alone
Alone
In hotels we are only voices
Kept safe and sound in phone lines
The distance makes the stronger weaken
So many days we'll never know

Don't give away what we've, tried so hard to keep

All things aside
I will be enough for you
Afraid or not
I will be enough for you
When I am gone
I will be enough for you
All things aside
I will be enough

The road we take will be the long one
So hold on tight, don't leave me
Take my hand, I'll bring you safely
To home
Your home
Across the country this I promise
I'll be back to take you on a trip to sunny, sanded beaches
But first we've gotta meet halfway

Don't throw away love we've, worked so hard to make

All things aside
I will be enough for you
Afraid or not
I will be enough for you
When I am gone
I will be enough for you
All things aside
I will be enough

So don't worry about time
It's not on our side
It never was before
Just forget about time
It's not on our side
That's never stopped us before, before

All things aside
Will I be enough for you?
Afraid or not
I will be enough

All things aside
I will be enough for you
Afraid or not
I will be enough for you
When I am gone
I will be enough for you
All things our side
I will be enough for you...---Lyrics submitted by Jake.
