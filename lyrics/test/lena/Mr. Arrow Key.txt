Mister, can you help me, Im lost here
Feels like Im getting nowhere, 
Im sure that I dont wanna stay here, stay here.
Mister, cant you see Ive got a problem?
You seem nice, could you solve it?
My bag is heavy and Im way too tired to keep moving on.

My feet are really hurting and my back is aching,
Got my body sweaty and my legs are shaking,
Ive been searching for someone to get to destiny, 
But I cant find the arrow key.

Been climbing on the walls, but Im falling down, 
Ive been running through the streets but I still havent found
Im looking for, Im searching for, desperately, 
But I cant find the arrow key.

Mister, Im feeling cold and Im lonely,
The people seem to ignore me, 
But I dont need someone to guide me, guide me.

Mister, you really seem to be a nice guy,
With your moustache and your kind eyes
It feels like I already know you, do I?

My feet are really hurting and my back is aching,
Got my body sweaty and my legs are shaking,
Ive been searching for someone to get to destiny, 
But I cant find the arrow key.

Been climbing on the walls, but Im falling down, 
Ive been running through the streets but I still havent found
Im looking for, Im searching for, desperately, 
But I cant find the arrow key.

My feet are hurting and my back is aching,
Got my body sweaty and my legs are shaking.
Been climbing on the walls, but Im falling down, 
Ive been running through the streets but I still havent found.

My feet are really hurting and my back is aching,
Got my body sweaty and my legs are shaking,
Ive been searching for someone to get to destiny, 
But I cant find the arrow key.

Been climbing on the walls, but Im falling down, 
Ive been running through the streets but I still havent found
Im looking for, Im searching for, desperately, 
But I cant find the arrow key.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
