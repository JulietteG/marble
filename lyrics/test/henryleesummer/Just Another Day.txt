People always tell ya
Boy be thankful for what you got
People always say the darnedest things, yeah
So, you quit takin' chances
Call that responsibility
Trade your dreams for a little security

It's just another day
Just another compromise
Just another night of wonderin' how it might've been
It's just another dream
Just another life thrown away
Ain't that a shame
It's just another day
Just another day

Old man, he was tellin' me
How he wish he'd done this and that
Oh somehow the time had just slipped away, yeah
He said it's too late, too late, 
And he turned and started to leave
He stopped, hung his head, 
I thought I heard him say

It's just another day
Just another compromise
Just another night of wonderin' how it might've been
It's just another dream
Just another life thrown away
Ain't that a shame
It's just another day
Just another day

Oh, don't let it be
Just another day
I don't think I could take
Another day
