Are you making movie?
Well, we don't like that
What's a brand new awesome?
I think it's tobacco

Are you making movie?
Well, we don't like that 
What's a brand new awesome?
I think it's tobacco
No, I think it's tomacco

Dark shades when it isn't bright
Cigarette and a harold tie

Librarian reading
Wouldn't say "hi"
Got up to leave and
Never said "bye"
Remember the astronaut before you fall
Or you're gonna be edged right
Off the wall---Lyrics submitted by Shana Tripton.
