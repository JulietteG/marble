I need a disguise 
Because otherwise 
I won't fit in 
I won't fit in 
And it won't eat our dollar bill 
Someday I think it will 
There's time to kill 
With some hope still 

The lighting in the photo booth 
Is perfect, to tell you the truth 
But it's dead 
Written in red 
The seat inside is just as great 
As back in '68 
And my camera's fine 
With no red eye 

Singing ammunition, there's a soldier on the stage 
But they leave after they play 
So they would not know 
I saw the waiter that we used to know 
But with my disguise 
He did not recognize me 

Where we sing is to the right 
This is where we spend the night 
The walls imply 
Walls that try 
Some people might be singing 
To there own unusual tune 
But so do you 
It's nothing new---Lyrics submitted by Shana Tripton.
