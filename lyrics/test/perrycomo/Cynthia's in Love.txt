Cynthia as flighty as a summer breeze
Her smile is sunlight through the trees
For Cynthia's in love

Every rose is blushing as she passes by
They see the love light in her eye
For Cynthia's in love

Every night when the stars above come shining through
You will find her in a rendezvous
Stary eyed breathing sigh's

Cynthia, I'm glad your lovely dream came true
For I'm the guy who worships you
My Cynthia's in love

Every night when the stars above come shining through
You will find her in a rendezvous
Stary eyed breathing sigh's

Cynthia, I'm glad your lovely dream came true
For I'm the guy who worships you
My Cynthia's in love---Lyrics submitted by Jack Lee.
