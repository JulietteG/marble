I
O 
U
I owe you
Kisses by the millions
I owe you
Love words by the billions
Wanna give you treasure
Only you can measure
Made my life a pleasure
Ever since we've been together
I owe you
All my young emotion
I owe you
All my deep devotion
Found real true happiness
Within in your wondrous
You know I must confess it's true
I'll even sign the dotted line
And a lifetime guarantee
That I am yours and you are mine
From now until eternity
I owe you
Schemes we planned together
I owe you
Dreams to last forever
Never thought that this could be
How I waited patiently
You proved your love belongs to me
Never thought that this could be
How I waited patiently
You proved your love belongs to me
You proved your love belongs to me
You proved your love belongs to me
You proved your love belongs to me---Lyrics submitted by ErD.
