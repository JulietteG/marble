Why do I follow the sun?
I've grown defenseless to your bittersweet lies
My eyes have opened
Now it's time to shine
Why do I follow the sun?
Where will I be when there's nowhere to run?
Why do I follow the sun?
Where will I be when there's nowhere to hide?
You
You were my sun
Now you're just a fucking waste of fucking time
These eyes
They see the world
The stars
They see the sun
Nothing can stop me this time
I've already made up my mind
You
You were my sun
You
You were my sun
This heart
Sometimes it's hard to move on
Move on
Move on
He see's himself in a whole new way
This is the start of judgement day---Lyrics submitted by Ryan Trudeau.
