Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly, out to my ol' 55
As I pulled away slowly, feelin' so holy
God, knows I was feelin' alive

And now the sun's comin' up, I'm ridin' with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade and I lead the parade
Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know the feelin's gettin' stronger

Six in the mornin' gave me no warnin'
I had to be on my way
Now, the cars are all passin' me
Trucks are all flashin' me
I'm headed home from your place

And now the sun's comin' up, I'm ridin' with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade and I lead the parade
Just a wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know the feelin's gettin' stronger

Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly, out to my ol' 55
As I pulled away slowly, feelin' so holy
God, knows I was feelin' alive

And now the sun's comin' up, yes it is, I'm ridin' with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks

Freeway cars and trucks, ridin' with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks, ridin' with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks, ridin' with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks, ridin' with Lady Luck---
