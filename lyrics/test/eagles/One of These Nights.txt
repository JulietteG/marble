One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out
Pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling
The fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers
And moans

You got your demons
You got desires
Well, I got a few of my own

Oo, someone to be kind to in
Between the dark and the light
Oo, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams
We're gonna find one
One that really screams

I've been searching for the daughter
Of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little
Of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere
In sight

Oo, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right
Oo, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights

One of these nights
In between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get 'ya baby one of these nights
One of these nights
One of these nights
I can feel it
I can feel it
One of these nights
Coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you now
One of these nights..[etc.]---
