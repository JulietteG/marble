Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You've been out riding fences for so long now. 
Oh you're a hard one. 
I know that you've got your reasons. 
These things that are pleasing you, can hurt you somehow. 

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy. 
She'll beat you if she's able. 
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet. 
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table 
But you only want the things that you can't get. 

Desperado. Oh you ain't gettin younger.
Your pain and your hunger they're drivin you home. 
Freedom, oh freedom. 
That's just some people talking. 
Your prison is walking through this world all alone. 

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time? 
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
Its hard to tell the night time from the day. 
Your losing all your highs and lows 
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes, away. 

Desperado. Why don''t you come to your senses 
Come down from your fences, and open the gate.
It may be raining, but there's a rainbow above you. 
You better let somebody love (let somebody love you) 
You better let somebody love you, before it's too late.---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
