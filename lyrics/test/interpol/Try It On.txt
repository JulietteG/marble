I need the sun light
To keep me above you
These moderations
I always hoped for
Did all this work for
Some piece of mind just because
On this side
You wanna see that
There's no change
And somewhere to stay
But if your right
Ill put my keys back
There's no change
And no hand to play

please explore my love's endurance
And stay, stay
please endure my love's exhortations
No way, no fucking way no
On this side
You wanna see that there's no change
And somewhere to stay
On this side
Your gonna see that there's no change
And nowhere to stay

Try it on

On this side
Your gonna see that there's no change
And nowhere to stay
But if your right
Ill put my keys back
There's no change
And nowhere to stay
There's nowhere to stay---Lyrics submitted by jorge lopez.
