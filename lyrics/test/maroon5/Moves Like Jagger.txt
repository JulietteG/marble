Oh

Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
Then aim for my heart
If you feel like

And take me away
Make it okay
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show 
Now I make it

You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a s**t
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you

Kiss me 'till you're drunk
And I'll show you

All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try
To control you
Look into my eyes
And I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Maybe it's hard
When you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when your with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key

Oh

So get in the car 
We can ride it 
Wherever you want
Get inside it

And you wanna steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you

Kiss me 'till you're drunk
And I'll show you

All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try
To control you
Look into my eyes
And I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

You wanna know
How to make me smile
Take control
Own me for just the night

And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to
Keep it
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe
Ooh baby rub me right

But if I share my secret
You're gonna have to
Keep it
Nobody else can see this
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you

Kiss me 'till you're drunk
And I'll show you

All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try
To control you
Look into my eyes
And I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger---Lyrics submitted by Aiyana.
