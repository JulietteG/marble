After school, walking home, fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt, cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember what life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate images life gives us from our pasts
Sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
Somehow I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through

And Mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only seven miles from the sun

Now, moving on down my street, I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath, feel the beat and the rhythm of my steps
Sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
Somehow I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through

And Mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only seven miles from the sun 

Rhythm of her conversation, perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee, the way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her, like a broken record player
Back and forth, and here and gone, and on and on and on and on

I cannot forget, refuse to regret
Somehow I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through

And Mama, I've been crying
Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said the battle's almost won
And we're only seven miles 
Said the battle's almost won
And we're only seven miles from the sun---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
