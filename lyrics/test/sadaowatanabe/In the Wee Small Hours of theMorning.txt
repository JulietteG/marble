In the wee small hours of the morning
when the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
and never ever think of counting sheep...

When your lonely heart has learned it's lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call...
In the wee small hours of the morning
that's the time you miss her most of all.---Lyrics submitted by Terry.
