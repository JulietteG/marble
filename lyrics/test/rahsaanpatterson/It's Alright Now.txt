I used to be
Your love fool
Believing every lie you told
Running to you
When you'd call
There to catch you when you'd fall

But then it became clear to me
You never really cared for me at all

Chorus :
It's alright
I'm gonna make it on my own
Baby
It's alright now
It's alright 
I'm gonna make it on my own
Baby
It's alright
Alright now

Lying eyes
Deceiving smile
Hypnotized me every time
Until the day
That I was awakened 
To the fact that you were never mine, no

Your heart's no more a mystery
I gave up on you loving me at all

Chorus :
It's alright
I'm gonna make it on my own
Baby
(Baby)
It's alright now
(Now)
It's alright 
(Said it's alright)
I'm gonna make it on my own
(I'm gonna make it)
Baby
It's alright
(Said it's alright, now)
Alright now
It's alright
(Oh it)
I'm gonna make it on my own
Baby
(Baby)
It's alright now
(It's alright, now, now)
It's alright 
(Said it's alright)
I'm gonna make it on my own
(I'm gonna make it)
Baby
It's alright
Alright now

And so you know wherever you are
I'm doing fine alone without you
Though it was hard to think I'd make it this far
Wherever you are I always get through to you

It's alright

Now it's become clear to me
You never really cared for me at all

Chorus :
It's alright
I'm gonna make it on my own
Baby
It's alright now
It's alright 
(Say I)
I'm gonna make it on my own
(I'm gonna make...)
Baby
It's alright
I'm gonna make it on my own
It's alright
I'm gonna make it
(I'm gonna make it)

It's alright
I'm gonna make it on my own
Baby
It's alright now
It's alright 
I'm gonna make it on my own
Baby
It's alright
Alright now
It's alright
I'm gonna make it on my own---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Cobb.
