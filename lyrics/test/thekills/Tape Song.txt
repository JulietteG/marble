You've got to
You've got to
You've got to
You've got to

Tape ain't gonna fix it
Honey, it ain't gonna stick
Tape ain't gonna fix it
Honey, it ain't gonna stick to you

Six kinds of glue
Won't hold you
Won't hold you
Oh my oh, oh my
You've got to

You've got to go straight ahead
You've got to, you've got to go straight ahead

Time ain't gonna cure you
Honey, time don't give a shit.
Time ain't gonna cure you
Honey, time's just gonna hit on you
I said time ain't gonna cure you
Honey, time don't give a shit
Time ain't gonna cure you
Honey, time's just gonna hit on you

You've got to go straight ahead
You've got to, you've got to, to go straight ahead

Time ain't gonna cure you
Honey, time don't give a shit.
Time ain't gonna cure you
Honey, time's just gonna hit on you
I said, six kinds of blue
Won't hold you, won't hold you
Oh my oh, oh my you've got to
You've got to, you've got to

You've got to go straight ahead
You've got to, you've got to go straight ahead---Lyrics submitted by gino.
