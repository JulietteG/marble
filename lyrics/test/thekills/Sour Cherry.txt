Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Cause it crossed my mind
Crossed my mind
Make my blood thump 7-8-9
Make my heart beat double time

Now Im the only sour cherry on the fruit stand right?
Am I the only sour sherry on the fruit stand
No, ooooo..
Oh

Im a penny in diamond mine,
We could be movers, oh 
Oh, we could be shakers, oh
If we could just shake something out of the blue and get off the ride,

Now Im the only sour cherry on the fruit stand right?
Am I the only sour sherry on the fruit stand
No, ooooo..
Oh

gggggGo home go home, its over,
gggggGo home go home, its over,
gggggGo home go home, its over,
go go home its over,
gggggo home go home, its over
go go home its over

hey

Now Im the only sour cherry on the fruit stand right?
Am I the only sour sherry on the fruit stand
No, ooooo..
Oh

gggggGo home go home, its over,
gggggGo home go home, its over,
gggggGo home go home, its over,
go go home its over,
gggggo home go home, its over
go go home its over---Lyrics submitted by venu.
