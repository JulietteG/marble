"You gonna be much longer, son?"

"Nah, not much longer..."

Woooahh ooahh oahhh, For the longest time.
Woooahh ooahh oahhh, For the longest...

If you said goodbye to me tonight,
There would still be music left to write.
What else could I do? I'm so inspired by you,
That hasn't happened in for the longest time.

Once I thought my innocence was gone,
Now I know that happiness goes on.
That's where you found me,
where you put your arms around me,
I haven't been there for the longest time.

Woooahh ooahh oahhh, For the longest time.
Woooahh ooahh oahhh, For the longest...

I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall,
and the greatest miracle of all.
("aahhh ahhhh ahhhhhhh")
Is how I need you, and how you needed me too,
That hasn't happened for the longest time.

Maybe this won't last very long,
But you feel so right, and I could be wrong.
Maybe i've been hoping too hard,
But i've gone this far, and it's more than I hoped for.

Who knows how much further we'll go on,
Maybe i'll be sorry when you're gone.
("aahhh ahhhh ahhhhhhh")
I'll take my chances, I forgot how nice romance is,
I haven't been there for the longest time.

I had second thoughts at the start,
I said to myself, hold onto your heart.
Now I know the woman that you are,
You're wonderful so far, and it's more than I hoped for.

I don't care what consequence it brings,
I've been a fool for lesser things.
("aahhh ahhhh ahhhhhhh")
I want you so bad, I think you ought to know that 
	I intend to hold you,
For the longest time!

Woooahh ooahh oahhh, For the longest time,
Woooahh ooahh oahhh, For the longest time,
Woooahh ooahh oahhh, For the longest time,
Woooahh ooahh oahhh, For the longest time,
woooahh . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .---Lyrics submitted by Charlotte.
