Ohh... ohh... ohh... ahh... yah... yah... yah.....

Careless talk
That's what you heard about me
Jealous talk
That's what I heard about you
Everybody's telling lies
I don't even know why
Why can't people
Find something better to do

Careless talk 
I don't believe what they say
I heard them talk
They say you've been putting me down
In the shadows on the phone
They won't leave us alone
They've been talking
Eversince you came around

Ohh...ohh... ohh... ahh... yah... yah... yah.....

Careless talk
Telling you I'm doing wrong
Jealous talk
Follows wherever you go
I'm aware of what you heard
Every terrible word
Everybody's making believe that they know

All of the intimate things
That we ever might have said
In the heat of a passionate moment
In a conversation shared
For the ears of nobody else
There are some things they'll  never hear
There are secrets I'll never tell

Careless talk
(Is) going around on the streets
Jealous talk
I know how hard it can be
Let them stand where they fall
They don't know us at all
All that talking won't make a diff'rence to me

Ohh... ohh... ohh.... ahh... yah... yah... yah....

Ohh...

Careless talk
That's what they say about me
Careless talk
That's what they say about you...---Lyrics submitted by cherry-roda.
