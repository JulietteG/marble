In every heart
There is a room
A sanctuary, safe and strong
To heal the wounds
From lovers past
Until the new one comes along

I spoke to you 
In cautios tones
You anwered me with no pretence
And still I feel
I said too much
My silence is my self defence

And every time 
I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes
And so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence
Made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share
This room with you
And you can have
This heart to break

And this I why
My eyes are closed
It's just as well 
For all I've seen
And so it goes
And so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose
To be with you
As if the choice were mine to make
But you can make
Decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And so it goes
And so it goes
And your the only one who knows---Lyrics submitted by Colm CROWLEY.
