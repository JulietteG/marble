Goodnight my angel time to close your eyes.
And save these questions for another day.
I think I know what you've been asking me.
I think you know what I've been trying to say.
I promised I would never leave you.
And you should always know.
Where ever you may go no matter where you are.
I never will be far away.

Goodnight my angel now its time to sleep.
And still so many things I want to say.
Remember all the songs you sang for me.
When we went sailing on an emerald bay.
And like a boat out on the ocean.
Im rocking you to sleep.
The waters dark and deep.
Inside this ancient heart.
You'll always be a part of me.

(Musical Break)

Goodnight my angel now its time to dream.
And dream how wonderful you're life will be.
Some day your child may cry and if you sing this lullabye.
Then in your heart there will always be a part of me.

(Musical Break)

Someday we'll all be gone but lullabyes go on and on.
They never die thats how you and I will be.---Lyrics submitted by Alivia.
