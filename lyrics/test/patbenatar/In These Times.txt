Whats the use in stayin
When everythings a lie
I hear what youre sayin
And it makes me want to cry
You know the truths so overrated
That should come as no surprise
Its all so complicated
Especially in these times

Dont it make you crazy
Dont it make yourself ask why
Nobodys got an answer
Especially in these times
In these times

Life is like a puzzle
Best to close the edges first
Work back to the middle
To the places where it hurts
Lately Ive been thinkin
Maybe theres a chance for us
If we take it slow now
And dont expect too much

Dont it make you wonder
Dont it make yourself ask why
Nobodys got an answer
Especially in these times
And dont it make you crazy
Dont it make yourself ask why
Nobodys got an answer
Especially in these times

Oooooooooh, Ooh ooh a Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooh, Oooh Oooh a Oooh a Oooh a Ooooooooh Oooh Oooh

(Spoken)
Whats the use in stayin
When everythings a lie
And there is nothing sacred
Especially in these times

Hey, dont it make you crazy
Dont it make yourself ask why
Nobodys got an answer
Especially in these times
And dont make you wonder
Dont it make you ask yourself why
Nobodys got an answer
Especially in these times

Oh a Oooh
Oh a Oooh Oh Oh
Oh a Ohhh
Oh a Oooh Ooooooooooooooooooh Oooooooh Ooooooooooh
