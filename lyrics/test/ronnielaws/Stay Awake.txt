Another day, another place
Another night and youre not here
Once again far from home
All alone to play my song
I know in just a little while
Ill be right there to see your face
But until I can

I stay awake and I want you by my side, baby
(I stay awake and I want you, baby)
I stay awake and I want you by my side, baby
(I stay awake and I want you, baby)
I stay awake and I want you by my side, baby
(I stay awake and I want you, baby)
I stay awake and I want you by my side

In a special way I need your touch
To fill the warmth that comforts me
And you know its true
All and all Id rather spend this time with you
But until I can

I stay awake and I want you by my side, baby
(I stay awake and I want you, baby)
I stay awake and I want you by my side, baby
(I stay awake and I want you, baby)
I stay awake and I want you by my side, baby
(I stay awake and I want you, baby)
I stay awake and I want you by my side, baby

I stay awake and I want you by my side, baby
(I stay awake and I want you, baby)
I stay awake and I want you by my side, baby
(I stay awake and I want you, baby)
I stay awake and I want you by my side
(I stay awake and I want you, baby)---Lyrics submitted by victor.
