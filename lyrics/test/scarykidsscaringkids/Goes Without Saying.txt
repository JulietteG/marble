We both know you want to come and get it what you waiting for?
Now you're scared of what you've see and only seen it in your dreams before
Cause when you least expect it, it will take you, take you by surprise
So take advantage, take it all, take it all before the moment dies

Well it comes without saying,
It's already known
It's written all over you

Well it comes without saying,
Don't let it go,
keep it inside of you

It comes without saying..

Now that you've got it and it's slipping through your finger tips
Well you gave and let go, now it's missing from your life again
So now you're tearing up the walls making a mess trying to dig it up
Now it's all too late you'll never find it, and the moments dead
The moments dead

It goes without saying,
It's already gone
It's written all over you

It goes without saying,
You let it go,
There's nothing inside of you

It goes without saying..

You know you want it what are you waiting for?
Take it all when the moment dies

It goes without saying,
It goes without saying
It's written all over you

It goes without saying
It goes without saying
Just keep it inside of you

It goes without saying,
It goes without saying
It's written all over you

It goes without saying,
It goes without saying
There's nothing inside of you

It goes without saying..---Lyrics submitted by AubreyAnna.
