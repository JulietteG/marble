If I flew into a mountain
Burn myself to nothing
That would be something
Would it be enough?
A pistol to my temple
Pull the trigger like its nothing
That would be something, but its never enough

This is all an illusion
What do you take me for?
It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just wont ever be enough

I hurt someone that loved you
Except that I felt nothing
That would be something, would it be enough?
I had everything you wanted
It shows to give you nothing
That would be something
This is all too much

This is all an illusion
What do you take me for?
It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just wont ever be enough
It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just wont ever be enough

Im burning alive
With a pistol to my temple
If we dont believe this reason for living
Then well never know do I want to know?
If we dont believe this reason for living
Then well never know do I want to know?
If we just give up give into the pressure were losing it all
Were losing control

It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just wont ever be enough
It makes no difference what I do for you
I would give you my life but it just wont ever be enough
