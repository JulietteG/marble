Verse #1

Through a strangers eyes I take a good look at my life
Only to find that I'm not living I'm not alive

Chorus #1

I want to live to tell the tale
I want to wake up before my trip sets sail
Don't want to  try to be anyone else
I just want to try to find myself 

Verse #2

No other life could understand that your just disappear 
So let me put this in perspective let me make this clear
I want to live to tell the tale
I want to wake up be for my trip sets sail
Don't want to try to be anyone else
I just want to try find myself I lve grown tired of the same old fucking stories
I think I'm ready  for a change
If there's a higher power up there watching over me 
Could u give me a side today, today
Cause I've grown tired I've grown tired
I think I'm ready for a change 
I want to live to tell to the tale 
I want to wake up before my trip sets sail 
Don't want to try to be anyone else 
I want to find myself, I want to find myself 
I want to wake up, I want to find myself, I just want to wake up 
I wanna find my self---Lyrics submitted by bana.
