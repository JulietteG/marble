What's Up Now!

I'm not giving up just yet
I won't give up 'till I lose
Your ideas aren't fair by any means
But I'll still try to follow through
I'm stuck in a corner now with nothing left to prove
This room is filled with expressionless faces
and one of them has a clue

And you know that just won't do
And you know that just won't do
Don't say you're innocent too soon
Don't say you're innocent too soon

Give it all away
give it all away
give it all...
everything for you 

What is it that makes you think
That you can bend the rules?
You really think that you are off the hook
it's coming back for you
Can't run away from fate that's something we all know
no matter how much you try
you'll still have no place left to go

But you know that just won't do
But you know that just won't do
Don't say you're innocent too soon
Don't say you're innocent too soon

Give it all away
give it all away
give it all...
anything for you 

Give it all away
give it all away
give it all..
anything for you 

If it happens then it happens
If it happens then it happens
If it happens then it happens
If it happens then it happens

If it happens then it happens
(what is it that you're trying to prove)
If it happens then it happens
(what makes you think that you can bend the rules)
If it happens then it happens
(what is it that you're trying to prove)
If it happens then it happens
(what makes you think that you can break)

Every single wish came true 
I will lie in front of you
I hope you're living your selfish fairytale
Well it's all down hill from here

There's nothing left to feel
So swallow your pride and choke back your tears
So swallow your pride and choke back your tears
