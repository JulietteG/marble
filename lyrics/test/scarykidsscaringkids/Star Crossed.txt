Star crossed lovers
They say we're not meant to be
'Cause the stars in the sky, and the fashion that they are aligned
I say if the futures been drawn out there's no point in living
I wont give up my love so that fate can have its way

If the stars say that you couldnt love me
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth
Dont ask my permission
All is forgiven

Star crossed lovers, we do what we want to
Some learn the hard way
We all learn through consequence
I say if the futures been drawn out then nobodys living
I won't give you up love, so fate can have its way
Its way

If the stars say that you couldnt love me
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth
Dont ask my permission
All is forgiven

Is it over? 
The stars keep this fire from burning out
Is it over?
Are you saying that youd really listen?
Is it over?
The stars keep this fire
Is it over?
The stars keep this fire

If the stars say that you couldnt love me
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth
Dont ask my permission
All is forgiven

If the stars say that you can not love
The stars keep this fire from burning out
If the stars say that you can not love me---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
