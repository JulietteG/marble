Do you think you're made of gold?
Invincible?
You think you can handle it?
You will learn from this.

I'm telling you friend
this is something worth fighting for.
Does it not seem contradicting
to sit back and watch them take more?
Caught like a deer in there headlights your stuck now.
You're bound by your fears
I suggest you break free or
you'll forever be damned here.

We are merely degenerates waiting for you
to come sweep us off of our feet!
They keep marching on
spilling blood like savages.
Taking lives while your cigarette burns, burns.

You can't tell me my friend
that that wasn't worth dying for.
gave it all and received nothing
may as well have let them take more.
Dig deep find the courage to speak
are you really still bound by your fear?
This is all just a dream now
you can't speak and your damned here.

We are merely degenerates waiting for you
to come sweep us off of our feet!
They keep marching on
spilling blood like savages.
Taking lives while your cigarette burns, burns.

This is our fight for freedom
this is our way of saying
this is our day.

We've been waiting for this one day all our lives
This nothing short of predictable.
Stop holding your head down
Give it up!
get a hold of yourself now.
Or give it up!
Your like a deer in the headlights,
You've given up!
To save your life.

We've been waiting, yeah waiting all our lives
This nothing short of predictable.
Stop holding your head down
Give it up!
get a hold of yourself now.
Or give it up!
Your like a deer in the headlights,
You've given up!
To save your life.
Find the will to save your life!---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
