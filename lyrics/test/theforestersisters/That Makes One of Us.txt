You've made up your mind
We don't want the same things
And that we can't change things
Wishing them away
And there's no use staying together 
Nothing lasts forever
That's what you say

Then that makes one of us
Not in love
That makes one of us
That can't give up
If you can walk away 
From the life we've made
Then that makes one of us

I still believe
We've got something worth saving
I keep hoping and praying
For one more chance
And I believe
Our love is worth fighting for
You're not trying anymore
I don't understand

Then that makes one of us
Not in love
That makes one of us
That can't give up
If you can walk away 
From the life we've made
Then that make one of us

Oh, that makes one of us---Lyrics submitted by Judy.
