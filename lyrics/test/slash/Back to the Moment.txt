You say you don't wanna go but you've got to understand
That you're so far away from me and I'm all alone
Even when you're standing next to me
Deep inside, I feel you want to go free

I wanted you eternally
I see the truth, now that you've lied to me

Can't you see that the pain breaks me in two
It takes me from you
I feel it stop my beating heart, with every little thing you do
It tears me apart, please make it stop and be mine again
So we can take it right back to the moment
Where we start again

And baby, you say you already know
But you won't ever understand
What it's like to feel you slippin' away from me
I'm down on my knees
Even though I tried to carry on
Deep inside, I feel like I'm the only one

I wanted you eternally, but I see the truth
Now that you've lied to me
Oh and you lie to me

Can't you see that the pain breaks me in two
It takes me from you
I feel it stop my beating heart, with every little thing you do
It tears me apart, please make it stop and be mine again
So we can take it right back to the moment
Where we start again

I feel like you're taking away
My everything, my everything
'Cause everything you say and do
It's like your playing a part
When the curtain finally closes
I wonder if you're going to take a bow
Before you break my heart, before you break my heart

Now listen to me
Can't you see that the pain breaks me in two
It takes me from you
I feel it stop my beating heart, with every little thing you do
It tears me apart, please make it stop and be mine again
So we can take it right back to the moment ---Lyrics submitted by joe.
