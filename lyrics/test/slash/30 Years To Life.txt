(feat. Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators)

So the story goes
This is a tale that must be told
For what could be your destiny
You never know

I never meant to be here
I never even tried
But until you know when you're lost and down
You'll come to trouble in time
It was a cold December
I wept day and night
In a steel-toed rage, made a big mistake
Now I'll be doing time

I was running with the order
I was running out of time
Now for me there is no quarter
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna die

Serving 30 years to life
What I did, I can't deny
Now the sorrow in my heart will never fade
I remember it so well
But now I'm sat here bored to hell
Lord, I'm sorry for the error of my ways

They sent me on a mission
Out to earn my stripes
Should've known damn well when the kerbstone fell
Things would never be right

I was running with the order
I was running out of time
Now for me there is no quarter
I don't wanna be here
I'm really not surprised

Serving 30 years to life
What I did, I can't deny
Now the sorrow in my heart will never fade
I remember it so well
But now I'm sat here bored to hell
Lord, I'm sorry for the error of my ways

'Cause now I know, now I know
I was wrong and I can't let this go
I know, now I know
I am sorry, what a wretched soul
Oh, what a big mistake

Now I'm growing old
18 years I've got to go
I waste way in this cage
I'm all alone
That's how the story goes
This is a tale that must be told
For what could be your destiny
You never know

'Cause when you're running with the order
You're only running out of time
Now for me there is no quarter
I didn't wanna be here
I don't wanna die

Serving 30 years to life
What I did, I can't deny
Now the sorrow in my heart will never fade
I remember it all went well
But it's too late to save myself
Lord, I'm sorry for the error of my ways

So the story goes
This is a tale that must be told
For the sorrow in my heart will never fade
So the story goes
This is a tale that must be told
Yes, I'm sorry for the error of my ways---
