The fire started long ago
The flames burn down still embers glow
So charred and black
There's nothing left to burn, to burn

We had the same dream
Lived life to the extreme
A loaded gun jammed by a rose

The thorns a knot around your head
Your ego cursed you 'til you bled
You can not crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah

The future isn't set in stone
Decisions past leave you alone
Betrayed us all with your own selfish greed, your greed, yeah

New soldiers now stand
At your beck and command
Recruits they are bought and paid by you

The thorns a knot around your head
Your ego cursed 'til you bled
You can not crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah

We were like brothers with the world in our hands
You always have to much to say
Some days you look back and you'll wonder why
You let it all slip away, yeah

(solo)

Crucify the dead
Crucify the dead

The thorns a knot around your head
Your ego cursed you 'til you bled
You can not crucify the dead
To me you're dead, yeah---Lyrics submitted by maria.
