So many dark roads, so many heartaches gone by
Sad souvenir, cant count a dog even try
I was lost in the shadows close to the end
I thought Id never find another friend

And I cant get enough of loving you
Cant get you out of my mind
And I cant get enough of loving you
Hope that Id hold you this time

When I least expected you walked in the room
And then you touched me, babe 
And my sadness was through
Youre there in the moonlight and in the morning sun
One thing I can tell you, babe, the best is yet to come

And I cant get enough of loving you
Cant get you out of my mind
Cant get enough of loving you
Hope that Id keep you this time

All of my sadness and all of my pain
Needs to be washed away or theyll drive me insane
All it takes is your whisper, the brush of your kiss
Will make me forget about everything but this

And I cant get enough of loving you
Cant get you out of my mind
Cant get enough of loving you
Hope that Id keep you this time

I cant get enough of loving you
I cant get you out of my mind
And I cant get enough of loving you
Hope that Id hold you this time---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
