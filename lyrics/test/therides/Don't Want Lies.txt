I got good days and bad days
Sometimes wonder how I make it through the week
I wake up in the shadow of my dream
Wonder what it is I see.

And I heard all the questions
I just don't have the answers
Ain't no fool to begin with
Adults are puppet masters
I'm not trying to be elusive
But you don't want lies.

Watch the shape of my future
As my life goes whistling back
The love of my woman 
And the time with my beautiful child

And I heard all the questions
I just don't have the answers
Ain't no fool to begin with
Adults are puppet masters
I'm not trying to be elusive
But you don't want lies.

There is peace as each piece of the puzzle
Falls into place
Just by looking back I can tell you
That life ain't just a raise.

And I heard all the questions
I just don't have the answers
Ain't no fool to begin with
Adults are puppet masters
I'm not trying to be elusive
But you don't want lies.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
