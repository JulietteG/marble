Come with it now
Come with it now

The Micraphone Explodes
Shattering the Molds
Ya either drop the hits like de la o
Or get the f*** off the commode
with the sure shot 
sure to make the bodies drop
drop an don`t copy yo
dont call this A co-opt
terror rains drenchin
qeuchin the thirst of
the power dons
that five sided fist-a-gon
tha rotten sore on the face
of mother earth the triggers
could empty ya purse

They rally round tha family with a pocket full a shells
They rally round the familywith a pocket full a shells
They rally round the family with a pocket full a shells
They rally round the family with a pocket full a shells

Weapons not food,not homes,not shoes
Not need to feed the war,canniball animal 
I walk tha corner to the rubble that used to be a library
Line up to tha mind cemetary,what we dont know
Keeps tha contracts live and movin
They don`t gotta burn tha books they just remove em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally round tha family,pocket full a shells

Rally round the family with a pocket full a shells
Rally round the family with a pocket full a shells
Rally round the family with a pocket full a shells
Rally round tha family with a pocket full a shells

Bulls on parade

Come with it now
Come with it now
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
