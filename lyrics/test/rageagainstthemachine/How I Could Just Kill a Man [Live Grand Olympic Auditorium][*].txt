Hey don't miss out on what you're passing,
you're missing the hootah of the funky buddah,
eluder of the fucked up style's that get wicked
so come on as I start to kick it,
cause we're like outlaws sridding while suckers are hiding,
jump behind the bush when you see me driving by'
hanging out my window, and my magnum taking out some negros
acting kind of loco I'm just another local
kid from the street getting paid for my vocals.
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

I be doing all the dumb shit yo
cause nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around I got ya humming
humming coming at ya! then you know I had to gat ya!
time for some action just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
in to your sattle light shining a battle light
Sen got the gat and I know that we'll gat you right
here's an example just a little sample:
how could I just kill a man
one time tried to come in my home take my chrome
I said yo it's on. take cover son or you're assed out
how do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
didn't have to blast him but I did any way, young punk had to pay
so I just killed a man

here is something you can't understand,
how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
one of the many missions that I have to establish
to lite my spliff ignite you with insite so if you ain't down
bullshit. say some punk tried to get you for your auto
would call the one time and play the rolemmodel?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
next hear the shot of a magnum slug, humming coming at ya!
yeah you know I'm going to gat ya. How do you know where I'm at
when you haven't been where I've been,
understand where I'm coming from.
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket or a faster ducket,
just to stay alive yo I got to say fuck it.
here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man.
here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man.
here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man.
here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man.

Here is something you can't understand,
How I could just kill a man
How I could just kill a man
How I could just kill a man---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
