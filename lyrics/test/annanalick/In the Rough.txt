You say you fell, while holding diamonds in your hands
It's your fault for running, holding diamonds I said

And I offer no sympathy for that
I hear that it was you who died alone
And I offer no sympathy for that
Better off I sparkle on my own
And some day love will find me in the rough
Some day love will finally be enough

I turned around three times and wound up at your door
Now you say you know all you did not know before

And I offer no sympathy for that
I hear that it was you who died alone
And I offer no sympathy for that
Better off I sparkle on my own
And some day love will find me in the rough
Some day love will finally be enough

I got your love letters
I threw them all away
I hear you think that I'm crazy
I'm driving 95 and I'm driving you away
I shine a little more baby

Some day love will find me in the rough
Some day love will finally be enough
Some day love will find me in the rough
Some day love will finally be enough

I shine a little more baby---Lyrics submitted by Cruz.
