We are like pendulums
our arms swinging at our sides
and I am a good little clock
walking along power lines.

I'm thinking like a swinging door
I'm hinging on these changing thoughts
between the pull up to the shore
and the push off.

In the lines are footprints in the snow
all along the edges of the row
and I haven't even walked my block
since I moved out here years ago.

The secret lives
of twist ties
hidden stories
in one line

In the lines are footprints in the snow
all along the edges of the row
and I haven't even walked my block
since I moved out here years ago

and we are like pendulums
our arms swinging at our sides
and I am a good little clock
I'm ticking off the time,
the time.

ooo-ooo-oooh-ooo-ooh.

The distant lights are twinkling
it means there is a wind
that blows the trees against themselves
and hard into this house 
I'm sleeping in.

I'm sleeping in.---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
