We still believe, we still believe
We still believe, we still believe

It's coming home, it's coming home
It's coming, Football's coming home
It's coming home, it's coming home
It's coming, Football's coming home again.

Tears for heroes dressed in grey
No plans for final day
Stay in bed, drift away
It could have been all
Songs in the street
It was nearly complete
It was nearly so sweet
And now I'm singing

Three lions on a shirt
Jules Rimet still gleaming
No more years of hurt
No more need for dreaming

Talk about football coming home
And then one night in Rome
We were strong, we had grown
And now I see Ince ready for war
Gazza good as before
Shearer certain to score
And Psycho screaming

Three lions on a shirt
Jules Rimet still gleaming
No more years of hurt
No more need for dreaming

We can dance Nobby's dance
We could dance it in France

It's coming home, it's coming home
It's coming, Football's coming home---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
