Baby I deserve better 
You know I deserve better 
Baby I deserve better 
You know I deserve better 

You hit me up, throwing me back 
Oh, you don't know how to act 
See, what you won't do, he would do for me 
Won't be blinded by my feelings 
You've been scheming on the low 
Creeping on the low 
Boy, you think your slick but I already know 
Don't know who you've been with before 
If she ain't let you know 
I ain't like them other girls, baby, oh 

You can forget about us, baby 
I read between the lines, so baby 
I never thought I'd say that 
You ain't good for nothing and you don't deserve my loving cause 

I deserve better, than you 
I deserve better 
Play your games with someone else 
I deserve better, than you 
Choking up the deuces cause I deserve better than you baby 
I deserve I deserve  
I deserve I deserve  
Better than you 
I deserve, I deserve 
I deserve, I deserve 

I'm be like fall away down 
Hey, I wouldn't give your love away 
But what's a girl to do now, hey 
Got me feeling some type away 
Cause you've been scheming on the low 
Creeping on the low 
Boy you think your slick but I already know 
Don't know who you've been with before 
If she ain't let you know 
I ain't like them other girls, babe, oh 

You can forget about us, baby 
I read between the lines, so baby 
I never thought I'd say that 
You ain't good for nothing and you don't deserve my loving cause 

I deserve better, than you

Choking up the deuces cause I deserve better than you baby
