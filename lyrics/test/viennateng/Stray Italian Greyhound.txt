Oh no, not now
Please not now
I just settled into the glass half empty
Made myself at home

And so why now?
Oh please, not now
I just stopped believing in happy endings
Harbors of my own

But you had to come along, didn't you?
Turn down the doors, throw open windows
Oh, if you knew 
Just what a fool you have made me

So what do I do with this?
This stray Italian greyhound
These inconvenient fireworks
This ice-cream-covered screaming hyperactive thought

God, I just want to lay down
These colors make my eyes hurt
This feeling calls for everything that I am 
Not

I'm not that kind
I'm so good at shooting down any notion
This tired world could change
It's all been bought
Well at least that was my line

And there's no use in spending all that emotion
When there's someone else to blame

But you had to come along, didn't you?
Rev up the crowd, re-write the rule book
Where do I go when every no turns into maybe?

So what do I do with this?
This sudden burst of sunlight
And me with my umbrella
Cross-indexing every weather man's report

Was ready for the downslide
But not for spring to well up
This feeling calls for everything I can't afford
To know
Is possible now

What do I do, what do I do
With a love that won't,
That won't sit still
Won't do what it's told?
What do I do, what do I do
With a love that won't sit still?

Please not now
Please not now
Please not now
Please not--

What do I do, what do I do
With a love that won't sit still
With a love that won't sit still

What do I do, what do I do
With a love that won't
With a love that won't sit still

What do I do, what do I do
With a love that won't
That won't sit still
Won't do what it's told

What do I do, what do I do
With a love that won't sit still?

Everything that I am
Everything that I am
Everything that I am
Everything that I am---Lyrics submitted by K G.
