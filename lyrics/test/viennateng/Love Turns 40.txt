she's holding a secret that she'll never tell
she's holding a secret that she'll never tell
'cause the myth is not supposed to retire
we'd rather it lit itself on fire
or overdosed in a four star hotel

she's holding a truth that she'll never reveal
she's holding a truth that she'll never reveal
because truth this time is an ugly child
and mother and daughter may reconcile
but their faces will never heal

don't go she says, but he's sleeping
she says it to herself
don't go, she sees herself rising
packing the suitcase with all of her shoes
but something keeps you faithful
when all else in you turns and runs
love turns 40, the morning comes

she's holding a secret that she'll never tell
she's holding a secret that she'll never tell
because we were once cinema gods in the night
now all we've got is lunch hour light
where nothing photographs well

don't go, she says, but he's sleeping
she says it to the dark, don't go
she sees herself rising
dressing in silence for nothing to lose
but something keeps you faithful
when all else in you turns and runs
love turns 40, the morning comes---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
