Nightfall we're brushing past your town
Destination not you my one
The driver doesn't know way down
How deep these bright-eyed feelings run
I've no intention of confessing today
I need to make distance awhile
But miles don't make your image fade
They don't erase this secret smile

Everything reminds me
Wet grey gold-lit street
Shop displays near-lovers meet
I feel the grasp of your hand still
This your face now in the glass
Breathing whisper what is this
Bent so close we nearly kiss
Although we never will

Strange that there's no hurtful need
Used to be my only sign
On my mind would make me bleed
Why is it that I'm feeling fine
Why is it this warmth within
No candlelight that causes burn
Memories of you begin
Well welcome friends
Glad you've returned

Everything reminds me
Music surging bedroom dance
Crazy spinning sultry glance
I inhale your presence still
These your arms of daring grace
Encircle me what pact is made
Desire is your masquerade
Want me you never will

You gave me truth I chose illusion
Now we are used to this confusion
But I know
Yes I know this story has to end
Never groped for a connection
Never hoped for more affection
For I know
I know I am your friend
Only your friend---Lyrics submitted by Serafina.
