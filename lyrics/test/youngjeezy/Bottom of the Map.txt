verse 1
im strapped up,im iced out

swirvin through traffic wit them goons behind me

whole car strapped,and i aint talkin seatbelts
red cross nigga,yeah we draw blood
whole team got choppers like a bike club
and i dont get mad,i just get money
and laugh at these fuck niggas cuz they so so funny
all a gangsta do is stay fresh
45 wit that gucci teflon vest

chorus(1x)

 verse 2
im on fire,the kid s out of control
competition want me to stop,drop and roll
like i had a flame thrower and some gasoline
set the city on fire,thats on erything
i walk around around like i gotta grip in my pants
yeah that s about 10 stacks halfa brick in my pants
fishscale got poppy on speed dial
ya niggas gettin raped ya still get oral based
my flow is bannanas the coupe is grape
evesle jeans wit the bape and apes
desert on the pillow choppers by the nightstand
go head roll the dice play wit ya life man

chorus(1x)

verse 3
all the tough talk ya just waistin ya breathe
hit ya ass wit them things have you chasin ya breathe
ya got loose lips ya better put a collar on em
black chanelle frames i spent a couple dollars on em
whole zip of kush just to get my mind right
gresham road see the warren get my sound right
my money come fast so thats how i spend it 
trunk soundin like it got a marchin band in it
you in the minor leahes and im a heavy weight
flippin brick houses we call it realestate
5 thousand for the pound get ya curb service
sell a lot of grass like i gotta lawn service
