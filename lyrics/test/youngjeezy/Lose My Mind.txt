(verse 1)
im hearin voices in my head think im skitzafrantic

she said as long as we can do it wit ya ice on
if thats the case we might as well leave the lights on
im out my mind,just blew a thousand swisher sweets
in my black and orange charger,call it trick or treat
it aint nothin to a boss, my goons got goons
how stupid dumb big,my rooms got rooms

(chorus)
why yall trippin,im just fine
12:45,bout that time
couldn't get it all week,time to unwind
drink like a tank,lose my mind

this shit crazy,way to bad
rozay baby(ha),waste 2 stackz
(aye young dis me bruh bruh)hardest thing in the lot,that there mine

(verse 2)(plies)
guess wat my momma told me,she hate my patnas

cuz all of em robbin'
fuck da police,cuz all of em problems
white girls fun,cuz all of em swallow
why i aint fuck ha at the house,cuz the bitch hollered
and where the pill man at,he need a blue dolphin
ol broke azz nigga,stop cock blockin
security,i need help cuz the bitch stalkin
a half fuckin mill,thats what the whip cost me
one-hundred dollaz,thats what the pussy cost me
and when the nigga start hatin,thats when the nigga lost me
fantastico,thats what the hoez,thats what the hoes call me

(chorus)
why yall trippin,im just fine
12:45,bout dat time
couldn't get it it all week,time to unwind
drink like a tank,lose my mind

this shit crazy,way to bad
rozay baby,waste 2 stackz
hardest thing in the lot,that there mine
cant spell sober,lost my mind

(verse 3)
drop the top,no broad,got ha titties out
mention my name and bring da whole city out
doing what i do best,d-boy stuntin
new car,old money,d-boy stuntin
step in cleaner then a new glock-40
nick name in the A,strapped up shawti
you know my nerves bad,trigger like a toothepick
line wrapped around the corner,boy too big
G-Code, black shadez and my black chainz
but if you wouldnt undastand,its a black thing
you kno we drink that rozay til we black out
wake up,drink some more,pass back out

(chorus)
why yall trippin,im just fine
12:45,bout that time
aint done it all week,time to unwind
drink like a tank,lose my mind

dis shit crazy,way to bad
rozay baby,waste 2 stackz
hardest thing in the lot,that there mine
cant spell sober,lost my mind
