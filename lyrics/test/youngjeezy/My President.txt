Yeah Be The Realest Shit I Never Wrote

This Will Be The Realest Shit You Ever Quote
Lets Go!

My President Is Black, My Lambo's Blue
And I Be God Damn If My Rims Aint Too
My Momma Aint At Home & Daddy Still In Jail
Tryna Make A Plate Anybody Seen The Scale

My President Is Black, My Lambo's Blue
And I Be God Damn If My Rims Aint Too
My Money's Light Green And My Jordans Light Grey
And They Love To See White Now How Much You Tryna Pay
Lets Go!

{Verse 1}

Today Was A Good Day Hope I Have Me A Great Night
I Dunno What You Fishin For Hope You Catch You A Great White
Me I See Great White Heavy As Killer Whales
I Cannot Believe This Who Knew It Came In Bails
Who Knew It Came With Jail Who Knew It Came With Prison
Jus Cuz You Got An Opinion Does That Make You A Politician
Bush Robbed All Of Us Would That Make Him A Criminal
& Den He Cheated In Florida Would Dat Make Him a Seminal
I Say And I Quote "We Need A Miracle"
And I Say A Miracle Cuz This Shit Is Histerical
By My Nephews And Nieces I Will Email Jesus
Tell Him Forward To Moses And CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor Does That Make Me A Konvict
Be All U Can Be Now don't Dat Sound Like Some Dumb Shit
When You Die Over Crude Oil As Black As My Nigga Boo
It's Really A Desert Storm that's Word To My Nigga Clue
Catch Me In Las Vegas, A.R. Arizona
Rep For Them Real Niggaz I'm Winnin In California
Winnin In Tennessee Hands Down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama On My Way To Sevana

My President Is Black, My Lambo's Blue
And I Be God Damn If My Rims Aint Too
My Momma Aint At Home & Daddy Still In Jail
Tryna Make A Plate Anybody Seen The Scale
Lets Go!

My President Is Black, My Lambo's Blue
And I Be God Damn If My Rims Aint Too
My Money's Light Green And My Jordans Light Grey
And They Love To See White Now How Much You Tryna Pay

{Verse 2}

I Said I Woke Up This Morning Headache THIS BIG!
Pay All These Damn Bills Feed All These Damn Kids
Buy All These School Shoes Buy All These School Clothes
For Some Strange Reason My Son Addicted To Polos
Love Me Some Spinach Dip I'm Addicted To Houston's
And If The Numbers Is Right I Take A Trip Out To Houston
A Earthquake Out In China A Hurricane In New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour I Showed My Ass In New Orleans
Did It For Soulja Slim Brought Out B.G.
It's All Love Bun, I'm Forgiving You Pimp C
You Know How The Pimp Be
That Nigga Go'n Speak His Mind
If He Could Speak Down From Heaven
He Tell Me Stay On My Grind
Tell Him I'm Doin Fine Obama For Mankind
We Ready For Damn Change So Ya'll Let The Man Shine
Stuntin On Martin Luther Feelin Just Like A King
Guess Dis Is What He Meant When He Said Dat He Had A Dream

My President Is Black, My Lambo's Blue
And I Be God Damn If My Rims Aint Too
My Momma Aint At Home & Daddy Still In Jail
Tryna Make A Plate Anybody Seen The Scale
Lets Go!

My President Is Black, My Lambo's Blue
And I Be God Damn If My Rims Aint Too
My Money's Light Green And My Jordans Light Grey
And They Love To See White Now How Much You Tryna Pay

{Nas}

YeaH!
History, Black History
No President Ever Did Shit For Me
Had To Hit The Streets Try To Flip Some Keys
So A Nigga Wont Go Broke
Then They Put Us In Jail Now A Nigga can't Go Vote
So I Spend Dough All These Hoes Is Trippin
She Aint A Politician Honeys A Polotician
My President Is Black Rolls Golden Charms
22 Inch Rims Like Hulk Hogans Arms
When Thousands Of People Is Riled Up To See You
That Can Arouse Ya Ego You Got Mouths To Feed So
Gotta Stay True To Who You Are And Where You Came From
Cuz At The Top Will Be The Same Place You Hang From
No Matter How Big You Can Ever Be
For Whatever Fee Or Publicity Never Lose Your Integrity
For Years there's Been Surprise Horses In This Stable
Just Two Albums In I'm The Realest Nigga On This Label
Mr Black President Yeah Obama Fa Real
They Gotta Put Ya Face On The $5000 Dollar Bill

My President Is Black, My Lambo's Blue
And I Be God Damn If My Rims Aint Too
My Momma Aint At Home & Daddy Still In Jail
Tryna Make A Plate Anybody Seen The Scale
Lets Go!

My President Is Black, My Lambo's Blue
And I Be God Damn If My Rims Aint Too
My Money's Light Green And My Jordans Light Grey
And They Love To See White Now How Much You Tryna Pay
