[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Fuck these haters, Id kill em all if I could
Aint scared of none of yall, so you know my aim good
Blowin bin Ladie in my Porsche 911
Just left Ground Zero, on my way to kush heaven
Cant slow down, too much evil in my rear view
Sometimes you wanna scream to God, but he cant hear you
And even if you did, thisll probably be his answer
Fuck you plainin bout? It aint like you got cancer
Do it for my niggas on the block that got it worse
First the love, then the hate, that just a trap niggas curse
I betcha feel like the whole world hatin on you
But whats the holdup? The whole world waitin on you

(The fame)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you wanna squeeze your Glock til its empty
Im already standin on the edge, so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy
(The fame)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you wanna squeeze your Glock til its empty
Im already standin on the edge, so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
You mean to tell me from runnin my big mouth
That I could chill here in this big penthouse
All elevatord up, black hardwood floors
Just to sit around and feel like it aint yours
Your conscience gotcha feelin like you done somethin wrong
But the flatscreen say motherfucker, we on
Pardon me, nigga, do you see this view?
See Ruths Chris from here, what the fucks wrong wit you
Lookin at my Rollie, yeah, its almost seven
Bill Gates state of mind wit a automatic weapon
You might member from puttin on for the city
Or back when it was on two, goin for the fitty
Opened up a few squares, opened up a few tours
Just to show niggas keys open up doors
Oh, we dont fuck wit Young no mo Why not?
The only thing I can figure, cause he on top

(The fame)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you wanna squeeze your Glock til its empty
Im already standin on the edge, so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy 
(The fame)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you wanna squeeze your Glock til its empty
Im already standin on the edge, so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers tempt me

(The fame)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
What up, world?
(Did you miss me?)
Long time, huh?
(Stop that)
Hey, look

Lately, I been off and out of sight, seldom out of mind
Ay, getcha business right, and stay the hell up out of mine
Im out my mind, tryin to fix it fore Im out of time
Dont worry bout me, God got me, bruh, Im doin fine
Another year in prison, promise this is it for me
Tryna make it through the storm, should be makin history
No feelin sorry for me, keep ya pity and ya sympathy
Good or bad, take it like a man, whatever meant for me
How I did it make em hate my spirit, they wish they could kill it
And theyll take it however they can get it
Wanna see me fulla misery, walkin wit my head down
Lets decapitate him, then well see if he can wear his crown!

(The fame)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you wanna squeeze your Glock til its empty
Im already standin on the edge, so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy

(The fame)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you wanna squeeze your Glock til its empty
Im already standin on the edge, so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy
(The fame)
I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you wanna squeeze your Glock til its empty
Im already standin on the edge, so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy

(The fame) I wake up and feel empty
Shit make you wanna squeeze your Glock til its empty
Im already standin on the edge, so dont tempt me
Fake motherfuckers envy
