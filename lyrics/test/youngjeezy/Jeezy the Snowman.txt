(intro)

Jeezy da snowman,I make it winter time
heard da streets hungry, well its dinner time 
watchin da state patrol, dey patol da state
Jeezy da snowman i patrol da weight

(verse)

360 fo da 195, front door service you aint even gotta drive
stacks on deck, fuck what a hater think
lot of dead white boys equal money in da bank
CTE isda click dat i claim, I know some real niggas dat claim da same thing
they dont want war these niggas want peice,17.5 i'm da snowman beast
i'm dopeboy fresh 4x black t, and its a million muthafuckas feelin just like me
(yeahhhhhhh)
we rollin fat like dat oprah bitch, color purple, all we smoke is dat purple shit
see da red dogs run like black cats, cost da work but i'm holdin on to my strap
hustle music, we call it track hop
a whole lot of baking soda in glass pot---Lyrics submitted by Jocques.
