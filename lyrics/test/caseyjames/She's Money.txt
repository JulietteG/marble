You can take everything that I own
You can take everything that Ive ever known
You can clean out the bank, burn it all up in flames
Take it all and run, Ill be OK
Cause I dont need a thing

Cause shes money
Well, shes silver and gold
Pure honey
So good for my soul
Whether rain or sunny
Shes money

Got all the green I need in her emerald eyes
I got empty pockets, babe, but I still get by
My ride aint fancy but she dont care
That dont matter as long as it gets us there
And thats why

Shes money
Well, shes silver and gold
Pure honey
So good for my soul
I love this greed
Shes all that I need
Whether rain or sunny
Shes whoo
Shes money, baby

Shes money
Oh, shes silver and gold
Pure honey, babe
So good for my soul, yeah

Shes money
Oh, silver and gold
Pure honey, babe
So good for my soul
I love this greed
Shes all that I need
Whether rain or sunny
Shes money
Well, shes money---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
