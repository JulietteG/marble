Peace of mind sometimes depends
On the path your hearts been traveling
Mines been broken, mines been bruised
Its fallen hard a time or two
And up til now I didnt know who could save me

Ive searched around enough to know
About holding on and letting go
And finally Ive found the one
Who makes me come undone

Now the bad, bad news dont sound so hard
Long, lonely miles dont stretch too far
I aint up all night praying for sleep
My empty pockets dont feel so deep
Whatever youre doing, baby
Keep it coming

Ive searched around enough to know
About holding on and letting go
And finally Ive found the one
Who makes me come undone

Undone like the clouds pouring out a perfect rain
Undone like the grace of heaven healing my pain
You lying in my arms, me whispering your name
Wont ever be the same

Well, Ive searched around enough to know
About holding on and letting go
And finally Ive found the one, well, Ive found the one
That makes me come undone
Well, you make me come undone---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
