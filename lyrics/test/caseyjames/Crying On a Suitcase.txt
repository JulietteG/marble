Boy, dont wait, dont think, dont lock the door behind you
Run and jump into your truck and hit the gas
Burn some rubber up
Yeah, your times running out, do it now

Take a shortcut, take a back road, take the shoulder to the exit
Skip the parking, screw the ticket, hit the curb and leave it sitting
Whatever it takes, you gotta get to that gate

Shes crying on a suitcase, sitting at the airport
Waiting on the airplane bout to take her out of here
Theyre gonna call her number, shell sit down by the window
The planell leave the runway and fade into a goodbye sky
Youve gotta run while youve still got time
Shes crying on a suitcase

Admit it boy, you blew it, really messed it up
You can make excuses if you really wanna lose her
Its all on the line, do or die time, getting on your knees time
Tell her that you want her, need her, love her, gotta have her
Everything good in your life begins and ends with her
Lose your pride while you can, come on, man, be a man

Shes crying on a suitcase, sitting at the airport
Waiting on the airplane bout to take her out of here
Theyre gonna call her number, shell sit down by the window
The planell leave the runway and fade into a goodbye sky
Youve gotta run while youve still got time
Shes crying on a suitcase

Shes crying on a suitcase
Waiting on the airplane bout to take her out of here
Theyre gonna call her number, shell sit down by the window
The planell leave the runway and fade into a goodbye sky
Youve gotta run while youve still got time, youve still got time
Shes crying on a suitcase
Waiting on the airplane
Shell fade into a goodbye sky---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
