I find it hard to say bye-bye
Even in the state of you and I
And how can I refuse?
Yeah, you rid me of the blues
Ever since you came into my life

Because youre my medicine
Yeah, youre medicine

I, I wanna marry you
Said I, I adore you
And thats all I have to say bye-bye
And you opiate this hazy head of mine

Because youre my medicine
Yeah, youre medicine

Because youre my medicine
Yeah, youre medicine---
