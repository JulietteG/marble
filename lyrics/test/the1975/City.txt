Dont call it a fight when you know its a war.
With nothing but your t-shirt on.
And go sit on the bed cause I know that you want to.
You got pretty eyes, but i know youre wrong.

And dont call it a spade if it isnt a spade.
And go lie on the floor if you want.
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was theyre too strong, too strong.
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong.

Yeah you wanna find love then you know where the city is [x4]

Yeah counting cards was the best job he ever had.
Cleaning up.
He got good with his 4s and his 2s.
That community service was the best job he ever had.
Cleaning up.
He got sick on the floor and his shoes.

Oh and she said its your birthday,
Are you feeling alright?
The next ones the MD.
Youll be feeling just fine.
Your brother is just sat there,
You said he felt snide.
You hope that that boy will be alright.

Yeah you wanna find love then you know where the city is [x4]

Yeah well she said its your birthday,
Are you feeling alright?
The next ones the MD.
Youll be feeling just fine.
Your brother is just sat there,
You said he felt snide.
You hope that that boy will be alright.

Yeah you wanna find love then you know where the city is [x4]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
