She grew up with the children of the stars
In the Hollywood Hills on the Boulevard
Her parents threw big parties, everyone was there
They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper, Bob Seger, and Sonny and Cher

She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage, I can tell that she can't let go and she can't relax
And just before she hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby, I say

Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Rockabye

She still lives with her mom outside the city
Down that street about a half a mile
And all her friends tell her she's so pretty
But she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while
Cause even her smile looks like a frown
She's seen her share of devils in this angel town

Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Rockabye

I told her I ain't so sure about this place
It's hard to play a gig in this town and keep a straight face
It seems like everybody's got a plan
It's kind of like Nashville with a tan

Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye

Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye

Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Rockabye, bye bye bye bye---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
