I cut my teeth by the time I talked
I wasn't listening
So I was made example of
Good advice given often although often gets old
I wasn't listening
So I was made example of

You see, if you dont change where youre going
Youre going to end up right where youre heading
If you dont change where youre going
Youre going to end up right where youre heading

Well I couldn't see the cracks that were showing
The bright side of me that had no way of knowing

If you dont change where youre going
Youre going to end up right where youre heading
Hindsight isn't helping me

I wasn't mindful
I wasn't minding anyone
The stubborn sails are full of an obstinate wind
I wasn't listening
So I was made example of

I dont doubt it, I never doubted it for a second
I dont doubt it, I never doubted it for a second

Its just that I wasn't listening
I wasn't listening

They say that if you dont change where youre going
Youre going to end up right where youre heading
If you dont change where youre going
Youre going to end up right where youre heading

Well I couldn't see the cracks that were showing
The bright side of me that had no way of knowing

If you dont change where youre going
Youre going to end up right where youre heading

They say that if you dont change where youre going
You know youre going to end up right where youre heading
If you dont change where youre going
Youre going to end up right where youre heading

Well I couldn't see the cracks that were showing
The bright side of me that had no way of knowing

If you dont change where youre going
Youre going to end up right where youre heading---Lyrics submitted by Yanoff.
