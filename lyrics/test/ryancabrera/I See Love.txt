There's a little boy on a city street
running scared on blistered feet
feels like life won't get much better
little did he know there would be a day
she would come along
make everything okay now
he's singing that love letter
and you said hold my heart like a memory
and don't let go

Cause suddenly the sun shines on everyone
everywhere every time you kiss me
and when I look anywhere baby
I swear I see love I see love
I see love I see love in the world

I've been a lot of things
seen a lot of ways
I can hold it in and not know what to say
hesitate even though I want it
no it wasn't me but there was a change
I could feel the ground start to wanna shake
what beautiful wonderful perfect moment
so hold my heart like a memory and don't let go

'Cause suddenly the sun shines on everyone
everywhere every time you kiss me
and when I look anywhere baby
I swear I see love I see love I see love
I see love in the world
and the grass is finally greener
and the darkness starts to fade oh all the way

And the sun shines on everyone everywhere
every time you kiss me
and when I look anywhere baby
I swear I see love I see love I see love

The sun shines on everyone everywhere
every time you kiss me
and when I look anywhere baby
I swear I see love I see love
I see love I see love

And the sun shines on everyone everywhere
every time you kiss me
and when I look anywhere baby
I swear I see love I see love I see love
I see love in the world
I see love in the world
I see love. ---
