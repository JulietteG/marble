I'm on the corner, catchin a late train
I'm going somewhere, I'm going nowhere today
I've got my reasons and my beautiful wine
I told my mama, said "boy you've lost your mind"
They say shut up, shut up your gonna ruin your name
They say clean up, clean up, don't think, just play

(Chorus)
s-s-say, say, say, say what you wanna say
cause I'm gone, yeah I'm gone (2x)

I crossed the border, watchin the sun drown
The seats are shakin, but I don't wanna slow down
Now I'm livin' in a beautiful town
There ain't no people, but they love my sound
Say wake up, wake up, you've got things to sign
They say pick up, pick up. Your life is on the line

(Chorus)

Oh, you used to be young, yeah you used to be wise
You used to be cool. What's with that look in your eyes?
s-say, say say what you wanna say

what you wanna sayeeayee yeah

Tell me how you like me, look at me like that
Tell me how you like that, look at me dancin now, look at me dancin now
Call me everyday just to say the same thing
Even in my sleep it's your voice repeatin, voice repeatin, tell me how you like me now

(Chorus)

Oh, you used to be young, yeah you used to be wise
You used to be cool. What's with that look in your eyes?
s-s-say, say, say what you wanna say

You don't know what you want, you don't know yeah (4x)
Say what you wanna say---Lyrics submitted by Bri.
