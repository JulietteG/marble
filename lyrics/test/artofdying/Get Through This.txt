I've seen better days, yeah
So says the mirror
It's hard to find divinity when you're the king of men

If I can get through this
I can get through anything
If I can make it through this
I can get through anything

If I can get through this
I can get through anything
If I can make it through this
I promise you
I promise you

It could be much worse, yeah
But the call is close
Tomorrow's my reason for today to let go

If I can get through this
I can get through anything
If I can make it through this
I can get through anything

If I can get through this
I can get through anything
If I can make it through this
I promise you
I promise you

If I can get through this
I can get through that
If you cut me wide open
I can cut you some slack
If you come when I'm leaving
I might never be back
I know it's not easy
just a matter of fact

If I can get through this
I can get through that
If you cut me wide open
I can cut you some slack
If you come when I'm leaving
I might never be back
I know it's not easy
just a matter of fact---Lyrics submitted by jose.
