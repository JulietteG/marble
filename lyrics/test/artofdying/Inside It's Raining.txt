Im scared to look down
Never been so high
And I cant look up with a closing mind
Im scared to be touched
I dont like the feel
Its way too close
Way too real

Inside its raining
It never lets up
I know Im crazy
Crazy enough to know that Ill find a way to make this all go away

Im scared to be me 
Because I look like you
I dont want to be somebody I never knew
Im scared to go out
Im so far in
I hear its nice
But Ive never been

I found mInside Its Raining

Im scared to look down
Never been so high
And I cant look up with a closing mind
Im scared to be touched
I dont like the feel
Its way too close
Way too real

Inside its raining
It never lets up
I know Im crazy
Crazy enough to know that Ill find a way to make this all go away

Im scared to be me 
Because I look like you
I dont want to be somebody I never knew
Im scared to go out
Im so far in
I hear its nice
But Ive never been

I found my only out, so just forget about talking me down
Ill put this fire out and stop this burning

Inside its raining
y only out, so just forget about talking me down
Ill put this fire out and stop this burning

Inside its raining---Lyrics submitted by jose.
