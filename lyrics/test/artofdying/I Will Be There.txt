Somebody's leaving
Somebody gives a damn
Somebody's dreaming
'Cause somebody knows they can
You can
For all the times this world ain't fair
I want you to know

I will be there
To watch you go, to let you know somebody cares
I will be there
To love you whole when nothing works and no one cares

Somebody's dying
Somebody's lost their wings
And somebody's losing their mind
Somebody knows no other way
And when this life gets hard to bear
I want you to know

I will be there
To watch you go, to let you know somebody cares
I will be there
To love you whole when nothing works and no one cares

I will be there
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there
I will be

Somebody's leaving
Somebody gives a damn

I will be there
To watch you go, to let you know somebody cares
I will be there
To love you whole when nothing works and no one cares

I will be there
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there
I will be, I will be there.---Lyrics submitted by jose.
