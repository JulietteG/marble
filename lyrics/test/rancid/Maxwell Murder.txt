Maxwell can't tell he's in hell
he just wants you to visit him there
same old game that he's playin'
his rules are never fair 

nobody want to look back everybody wanna get high tonight
before they run outta time where's the felon the chargible
felon the name of the crook who committed the crime 

dial 999 if you really want the truth
dial 999 if you can't see it through
he ain't jack the ripper he's your ordinary crook
calling maxwell murder for you 

maxwell got a hand in his plan
he knows who you are in this plan
chop the rock before you bought it
sick maxwell knows you got it

nobody want to look back everybody wanna get high tonight
before they run outta time where's the felon the chargible
felon the name of the crook who committed the crime 

dial 999 if you really want the truth
dial 999 if you can't see it through
he ain't jack the ripper he's your ordinary crook
calling maxwell murder for you
