Under a red hot moon, take a bus downtown to the Grave yard shift tonight
Under a red hot moon, take a bus downtown to the Grave yard shift tonight

KCs from Cali, California.
She's got a reputation that she didn't ask for.
Shes waiting for an escape now, escape is called the 164.
Now, KC, she wont admit when shes wrong,
Now KC, shes always run, run, run.
Shes a punk rocker, she dont trust no one
On a south end bus all alone.

Under a red hot moon, take a bus downtown to the Grave yard shift tonight
Under a red hot moon, take a bus downtown to the Grave yard shift tonight

KC was never caught up, like the rest of the rats in a fucking maze
Check me out she said, Im in a concrete jungle,
Im an individual and youre stuck in my waste
Oh hell no, she knows what the truth is. Because she said so
She knows who her friends are so fuck you, dont get no closer,
Itll only make her run far away

Under a red hot moon, take a bus downtown to the Grave yard shift tonight
Under a red hot moon, take a bus downtown to the Grave yard shift tonight

I know KCs brother pretty well, lets say
We spent a lot of time hanging out
I always thought for he said that shed be the one to get out of here
And make a life fore herself
But when we found her in the little league park,
In the dugout it was cold in the dark.
No one knew why she wouldnt wake up,
I think she finally made it back home.

Under a red hot moon, take a bus downtown to the Grave yard shift tonight
Under a red hot moon, take a bus downtown to the Grave yard shift tonight

[Rap verse by Rob Aston]
One time for your mind, two times for your soul three for the graveyard and the money I fold.
Dimmed out in the city where the sun burns slow, no hope its a pity I cant say no.
Its not my time to go, its not my time to die,
The last thing I wants for my mother to cry
It was love at first light, since the very first night,
Things have never been the same since I took my first flight.
The way I live my life, I love; I live lavish, lost me from the start.
You lose, youll never have it! Untouched, unleashed, back up you dont want it.
Stick him for his cash. Its back, now hes fronting.
Take two pass, Ill take to blast.
Bust a mother fucker; Im out on the flash. Pimped out, high as fuck.
Im out of control. Let's bounce, rock, skate, Man I'm ready to roll.

Under the red hot moon.
Under the red hot moon.
Under the red hot moon.---Lyrics submitted by Sufri.
