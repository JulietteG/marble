One man gives an opinion
The other man takes offence
When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance
Diabolical dance
Diabolical dance
When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance

Well, Andy told his friends and family
It's real too hard to stand
If I standing uncle
Police man, don't put me away
Well, any poop that train can afford
Well that place was going as hell
Even though it was summer time
He throws them in the county jail

One man gives an opinion
The other man takes offence
When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance
Diabolical dance
Diabolical dance
When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance

Let's do this

Well it starts with a disagreement
Melanie should have walked away
You see Penny been doing this many times
He knows how this court play
Well, his brother is up and he raise his fist
He'll commit himself a robot and you'll see then
Though they can't, Penny go
Anymore more share and the violence grows

One man gives an opinion
The other man takes offence
When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance
Diabolical dance
Diabolical dance
When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance

One man gives an opinion
The other man takes offence
When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance
Diabolical dance
Diabolical dance
When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance

When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance
When it comes to violence
Its a diabolical dance---
