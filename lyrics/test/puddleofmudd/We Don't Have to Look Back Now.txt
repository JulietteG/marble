i'm so much like you
restless and reckless
i need a clue
to show me a sign
i feel like making a move
real geographic
a change in mood
we'll let go of everything we know

you and i are out tonight
till the past is out of sight
we don't have to look back now
from the dark into the light
we can leave it all behind
we can stand together
we don't have to look back now

i'm so much like you
caught in the moment
coming unglued
in a world so big
its not easy to choose
which path to take
which pawn to move
so let go of everything we've ever known

you and i are out tonight
till the past is out of sight
we don't have to look back now
from the dark into the light
we can leave it all behind
we can stand together
we don't have to look back now

no one can stop us now
the world is rushing by
the wind is at our back
everything's new tonight
we're going our own way
no matter what they say
the bridge is on fire
we're flying higher now

you and i'll ride tonight till the past is out of sight
we don't have to look back now
we are knocking down the wall
all for one and one for all
we can stand together
never gonna look back now

no, no, no, no
we don't have to look back now
no, no, no, no
we don't have to look back now---Lyrics submitted by Juliet.
