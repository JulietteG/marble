1.
These are not the best of times, I know 
I wouldn't blame you if you choose to go 
I'm sorry for this gloomy circumstance 
But everyone deserves a second chance 
Everyone deserves a second chance 

2.
Silence is an icy alibi 
Not to speak the truth is still a lie 
Love is so much more than just one dance 
But everyone deserves a second chance 
Everyone deserves a second chance 
Bridge

Love's a crazy traitorous game for thrill 
Funny how I never thought  
I'd have to coop and plead 

Guilty of the crime that set this stage 
Some soothing magic words might quell this rage 
Forgiveness doesn't tangle with romance 
And everyone deserves a second chance 
And everyone deserves a second chance---Lyrics submitted by  .
