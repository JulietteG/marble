The phone starts ringing again, I think it's my girlfriend
This time I know that it's finally over
She keeps bringing me down, will this all turn around?
Right now I feel like I'm slowly dying

You know I've heard it all before
Now my eyes they run like faucets
Until my tears are dry

She said we were in love
I take a sip of my water
I guess we'll carry on at last
She still thinks it's my fault
And I'm nobody at all
She must have thought I was someone else before

I'm not so special now, I always knew it somehow
I guess she never had guts to tell me
Is it my spiked blonde hair, that fact my chest is bare
Or that my wardrobe is all in black, it's all in black
It's all in black, you want me back?
Well I won't be back!

Because you're always keeping score
But now the scorecard's in my pocket
And now the match is won

She said we were in love
I take a sip of my water
I guess we'll carry on at last
She still thinks it's my fault
And I'm nobody at all
She must have thought I was someone else before.---Lyrics submitted by Lindsay.
