What makes all of us hate?
We're all the same
We roll the dice
And we play your game
We complicate
Show us the way
Before it's too late
And the whole thing breaks

We have a name
We all create
Everything else,
the mistakes we made
We'll make a change
We'll concentrate
Before we suffocate

Can't hold this in
And keep it quiet any longer
I've fallen in
And now this feeling's getting stronger

Take my breath away
Now I'm trying to get up
I'm trying to retrace
My steps back
To wherever I messed up
Is forever enough?
I'm holding on
I know you'll be there
Whenever I wake up

What makes everything change?
We're not the same
We all get stuck in the same clich
We're taking aim
We dominate
Put on the pressure
Then the whole thing breaks
How come we wait?
Why do we hate?
We're falling away like the last crusade
We rearrange
We need to change
before we suffocate

Can't hold this in
And keep it quiet any longer
I've fallen in
And now this feeling's getting stronger

Can't hold this in
And keep it quiet any longer
I've fallen in
And now this feeling's getting stronger

Take my breath away
Now I'm trying to get up
I'm trying to retrace
My steps back
To where ever I messed up
Is forever enough?
I'm holding on
I know you'll be there whenever I wake up

(Now I'm trying to get up)
I'm trying to retrace
I've fallen in
(and now this feeling's getting stronger)

You take my breath away
Now I'm trying to get up
I'm trying to retrace
my steps back
to where ever I messed up
Is forever enough? (Is forever enough?)
I'm holding on
I know you'll be there
Whenever I wake up
Whenever I wake up
I know you'll be there whenever I wake up
Whenever I wake up
If I wake up!

What makes all of us hate?
Show us the way
Before it' too late
And the whole thing breaks---Lyrics submitted by mark.
