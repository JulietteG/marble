You never ever leave my mind
My sweet, sweet Madeline
Every time I look into your eyes
I feel like I'm alive
And I can barely make a sound
Whenever you're around
You can find me hiding in the crowd
Next time you come to town

Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
Can't ever find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times

Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
Can't ever find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times

Wish I could somehow let you know
That all the way from here to Mexico
You're the one and only girl for me
He-he tu es un, bonjour oui oui
And my tongue gets tied so quick
I get so nervous I'm feeling sick
I turn into the world's worst Romeo
Every time I try to say hello

You're so fine
Been on my mind
Get nervous every time
I see you hop on by

Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
Can't ever find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times

Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
Can't ever find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times

Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
Can't ever find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times

Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
Can't ever find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times

Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
Can't ever find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
