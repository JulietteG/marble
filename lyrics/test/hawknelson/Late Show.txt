you get me so simply but my heart won't let me

i won't forget the night i saw her at the movies she has this way about her she smiles whenever she walks i'm trying to find the nerve to finally introduce me she has this glow about her you'd catch whenever she talks 

let's go knocking on my window we can watch the late show and movies made for cable and then we'll talk listening to punk-rock we'll hang out and wait up until the sun comes up
