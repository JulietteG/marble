When i hurt you
i never meant to hurt 
im just trying to work through
things in my life
emotions can be mean and
i didnt really  mean it
i never stopped believing
in your truth
im not big on waiting
i could use some patience
this time im not afraid of losing

CHORUS
Wrap your arms around me i know
trying hard not to let go 
everytime i stand up i fall without you
when you wrap your arms around me i know
your with me where ever i go 
nothing else matters at all when your here

your always near me
even when its ugly
even when im screaming up to you
im thankful for your mercy
you always seem to hear me
its not alwyas easy
to push through
im not big on waiting 
i could use some patience
this time im not afraid of losing
and im not one to bow 
when the sun is going down
im happy just to wait for you

CHORUS

i promise ill never doubt you
you know im lost without you
please hold me in your arms
tonight

CHORUS

when you here
when you here---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
