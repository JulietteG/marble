Your Life dreams are shattered, 
Now you're gone away. 
We've cried here for hours, 
And the hours turn to days. 
We know you regret this, 
Leaving us here, 
With portraits and memories 
That we've held so dear. 

When I hear your name, it's not the same. 
No matter what they say, I'm not okay. 
And we started at zero, and went different ways. 
Now we're all out here wasting away. 

And if we started at zero, then how did things change? 
It seems like just yesterday we were the same. 

It's been three months since he left us. 
So far nothing's been the same. 
And my question without answer is: 
Am I the one to blame? 

He was such a good description of a favored future man. 
He spoke well of other people, and they said the same for him. 

When I hear your name, it's not the same. 
No matter what they say, I'm not okay. 
And we started at zero, and went different ways. 
Now we're all out here wasting away.

And if we started at zero, then how did things change?
It seems like just yesterday we were the same.
We were the same.
We were the same.

They say they're sorry, but what are they sorry for?
How could they possibly know what I'm going through?
I feel like no one's had to deal this pain that I'm dealing with right now!

Just 6 months ago everything was fine 
Or so it seemed, what sort of thing caused it to go downhill?
His parents are devastated, his girlfriend's depressed! 
What was he thinking????!!!!!!!!

And we started at zero and went different ways. 
Now we're all wasting away.
Wasting away. 
Wasting away.
Wasting away.

And we started at zero 
And went different ways 
Now we're all out here wasting away 
And if we started at zero 
Then how did things change? 
Seems like just yesterday we were the same 
We were the same 
We were the same---Lyrics submitted by Hayden.
