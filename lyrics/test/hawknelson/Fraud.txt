So you talk then then you stop
And you look at the mop-
headed kid who is right by your side
He feels great as he takes
All the jokes you create
And he'll steal them with all of your lines

Everybody thinks he's the greatest
You know he's just a fraud
He makes you so frustrated
Can't wait 'till he gets caught

Now he's taking all your words
Goin' through the motions
As if he's never learned
And now he's just a mirror that you see
Without causing commotion
Just stop being me

You get up take a walk
'Cuz you almost threw up
At the way that he hits on your girl
At the sink take a drink
'Cuz there's nothing left to bring
'Cuz you know that it's already brought

Now he's taking all your words
Goin' through the motions
As if he's never learned
And now he's just a mirror that you see
Without causing commotion
Just stop being me

You're the scum and
I'm the mountain water
Rolling through the fields
Where you're not invited
Go your own way now
Before it's too late
Just stop being me

Everybody knows you're the lamest
We all know you're a fraud
Life can be so frustrating
I'm so glad you got caught

Now he's taking all your words
Goin' through the motions
As if he's never learned
And now he's just a mirror that you see
Without causing commotion
Just stop being me

You're the scum and
I'm the mountain water (Just stop being me)
Rolling through the fields
Where you're not invited (Just stop being me)
Go your own way now
Before it's too late (Just stop being me)
Just stop being me


You're the scum and (Now he's taking all your words)
I'm the mountain water (Going through the motions)
Rolling through the fields (As if he's never learned)
Where you're not invited
Go your own way now (And now he's just a mirror that you see)
Before it's too late (Without causing commotion)
Just stop being me

You're the scum and (Now he's taking all your words)
I'm the mountain water (Going through the motions)
Rolling through the fields (As if he's never learned)
Where you're not invited
Go your own way now (And now he's just a mirror that you see)
Before it's too late (Without causing commotion)
Just stop being me---Lyrics submitted by Dennison.
