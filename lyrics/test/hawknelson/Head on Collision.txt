VERSE 1:He was a simple boy he just like to have fun, he never wanted to be just like his dad was, he was a dreamer but he had never had none, who made the most of his life, but never had one, he was a sing'a boy he could never slow down, he always wanted to lead, but didn't know how, he was a dreamer who seemed to never break ground,who spent most of his life in a small town

CHORUS:shake up my life let's go back to the days when we were young and all restless, we still believed and hadn't built up offences, there's one thing for sure, 'til we make the decision, we'll never take this world unless we make a head on collison, a head on collision 

VERSE 2:And daddy told her she could never have late night out with her man, so she sits crying by the window, everytime she gets another A she makes it another day, and it's just that simple

CHOROUS: Shake up my life, let's go back to the days when we were young and all restless, we still believed and hadn't built up offences, I'll tell you one thing for sure, 'till we make the decision, we'll never take this world unless we make a head on collision, a head on collision

I:Here they come now, will you come down, make 'em run now, on to the next town, here they go now, let's make 'em run now, no time to time to figure out, everything breaks down:I (REPEAT 3 TIMES)

                                        CHOROUS: 3 times

Don't you know there's more to this then what  we thought 'cause we were never listening. We heard it all before but we missed it when all we needed was a head on collision (Repeat)

                                                   END---Lyrics submitted by joe.
