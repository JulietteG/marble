My life is simple and
I'm not a superman
I never said that I was more than that
I'm not a wanna be
I'm who I want to be
And I intend to be
How you created me

II need Somebody on the inside
II want Somebody who can set me free
I'm not The only one who feels like this
I've got a few others around me
Hey

Hey let me hear you say
Make some noise if you feel this way
Hey if you've got a friend like that
Hey lets scream and shout
If you know what I'm talking about
Anybody got a friend like that

I once was little and
I always had a plan
You thought my friendliness
Was just an act (hey) 
I'll be your friend indeed
And you can count on me
And I can guarantee 
Your friend I'll always be

II need Somebody on the inside
II want Somebody who can set me free
I'm not The only one who feels like this
I've got a few others around me
Hey

Hey let me hear you say
Make some noise if you feel this way
Hey if you've got a friend like that
Hey lets scream and shout
If you know what I'm talking about
Anybody got a friend like that

Does anyone out there feel alone
Can anyone hear me (woh, woh)
Down and out your heart is cold
Its never easy (woh, woh)
But if you believe that there is hope
Then sing it with me

Hey let me hear you say
Make some noise if you feel this way
Hey if you've got a friend like that
Hey lets scream and shout
If you know what I'm talking about
Anybody got a friend like that

Hey let me hear you say
Make some noise if you feel this way
Hey if you've got a friend like that
Hey lets scream and shout
If you know what I'm talking about
Anybody got a friend like that

II need Somebody on the inside
II want Somebody who can set me free
I'm not The only one who feels like this
I've got a few others around me
