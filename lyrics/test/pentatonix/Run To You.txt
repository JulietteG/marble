A light in the room,
it was you who was standing there.
Tried it was true,
as your glance met my stare. 
But your heart drifted off,
like the land split by sea.
I tried to go, to follow, 
to kneel down at your feet.

Chorus: 
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run (run) to you
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run (run) to you

I've been sad earning scores.
I've been fighting so long.
But I've lost your war, and our kingdom is gone,
how should I win back your heart which was mine?
I have broken bones, and tattered clothes; 
I've run out of time.

Chorus:
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run (run) to you
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run (run) to you

Bridge:
Oh-oh-oh
I will break down the gates of heaven! 
1,000 angels stand waiting for me!
Take my heart and I lay down my weapon! 
Break me shackles to set me free! 

Chorus: 
I'll run, I'll run, I'll run (run) to you
I'll run (I'll run), I'll run (I'll run),  I'll run (run) to you
