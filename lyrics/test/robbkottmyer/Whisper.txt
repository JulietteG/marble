In the irratic rat race
I find it hard to keep pace
Just need a little solitude
Thats when I found you

Whisper, whisper, whisper my name
Whisper, whisper, you whisper my name

Racing fighting trying to get home
in your arms I will find calm
Tense - Im tired, wanna see you
The stress of today I must plough through

Whisper, whisper, whisper my name
Whisper, whisper, you whisper my name

I can feel the tension mounting
One thing can ease my strain
I can feel my heart pounding
My love for you, Ill not contain

Whisper, whisper, whisper my name
Whisper, whisper, you whisper my name
Whisper, whisper, whisper my name
Whisper, whisper, you whisper my name---Lyrics submitted by Robb Kottmyer.
