The club is jumpin
And the beat is thumpin
Energy is pumpin
All just gettin the funk

All the dramas sellin
Aint no lie im tellin
Hear the bass a whalin
All just gettin the funk

Hes slammin the chunk
Hes dumpin the junk
He dont play no punk
Hes just the Monk
Hes slammin the chunk
Hes dumpin the junk
He dont play no punk
Hes the Monk, the Monk of Funk

See their hips a swingin
Cause of the beat hes bringin
Hear em all a singin
All just getting the funk

Never heard him jammin
Quite like the funk hes slammin
Bring the house down crashin
All just gettin the funk

Hes slammin the chunk
Hes dumpin the junk
He dont play no punk
Hes just the Monk
Hes slammin the chunk
Hes dumpin the junk
He dont play no punk
Hes the Monk, the Monk of Funk---Lyrics submitted by Robb Kottmyer.
