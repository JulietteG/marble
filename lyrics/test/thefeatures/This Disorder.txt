I'm having trouble standing still,
and when I do my mind starts to reel,
Starts to reel
Is this the way that I should feel
Is this the way that I should feel

Is there a need to be concerned
Have they done studies, what have they learned?
What have they learned?
I fear that soon I'll lose my nerve
Well I fear that song I'll lose my nerve

It's this disorder,
This disorder!

What's happening to me?
Well I need some answers,
The problem here is plain to see,
Commonly known as an LCD, an LCD
and no need, more activity
Well I think I know a remedy.
Just shake your arms and move your feet,
and pretty soon you will find a beat,
Find a beat,
And do what happens naturally.
Just do what happens naturally.

This disorder,
This disorder!
I see it every day,
and it can't be hard to shake,

This disorder,
This disorder,
What's happening to me?
I need some answers!

Well I need some answers!---Lyrics submitted by Jerry Sailor.
