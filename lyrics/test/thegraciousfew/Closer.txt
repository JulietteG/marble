I have been wronged by you
Someday youll someday youll see
What has been done brings you
Closer to closer to me
The closer that we grow, always high always low
The harder that we fall, always right always wrong
I have been wronged by you
Someday youll someday youll see
What has been done brings you
Closer to closer to me
Unbroken, and reborn, second sight & well worn
Unbridled and restless, reminded & venomous
I have been wronged by you
Someday youll someday youll see
What has been done brings you
Closer to closer to me
Did you say you never meant it?
Did you scream it out loud?
Someday youll someday youll be
A ship afloat an endless road an empty soul & nothing to me---Lyrics submitted by Irlana.
