Loud was the sound of the birds when they landed in spite of
Noise from the boys with the rocks in their fists
Looking to bring a man down to the bottom of a thousand ton well
One tiny push send that man into hell
He hit with a thud therell be no work tomorrow
Just a funeral for a guy with time that he borrowed

Isnt it crazy?
Ode to the one thatll drag you down
Isnt it crazy?
Ode to the one thatll let you drown
Wait for the call itll come by tomorrow
Your banshee, your lust, indifferent sorrow
Honey dont run cause theres nowhere to go
Shes got your number she got your code

Blue is the color your skin fades to when theres no pump of
Blood through your veins or your heart or when you got no love
Trouble is looking for someone to drain
The rattle does roll when theres something to gain
Was it the shove that done did that man in
Or the lady who came and blew in with the wind?

Isnt it crazy?
Ode to the one thatll drag you down	
Isnt it crazy? 
Ode to the one thatll let you drown
Wait for the call itll come by tomorrow
Your banshee, your lust, indifferent sorrow
Honey dont run cause theres nowhere to go
Shes got your number she got your code

Hail to the mother
Tell your brother, your friends
Cant lock your doors cause shes already in
Dressed all in black with a staff in her fist
She wails to her hounds
Sink their fangs with a kiss---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
