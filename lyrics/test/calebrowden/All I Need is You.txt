Lord, Here I stand with nothing to Give
A line in the sand, a life to be lived
My heart is longing

Your mercies are new with every new day
So why do I chose to throw them away?
Lord, Bring me back to You

(Chorus)
Nothing compares to all that You are
In Earth and Heaven.
Nothing can stand without Your hand
You guide me through
the darkest night,
the bitter cold.

In Everything I've come to know
All I Need Is You.

(Verse 2)
Lord, Here I am, completely amazed.
I long for You now, just a glimpse of Your face
My Heart is Bursting.
It's Overflowing.

(Repeat Chorus)

Yeah. Oh.

Gold to Rust.
Treasures to Dust.
I know that
All I Need is You.
When Everything Fades
Your Love stays the Same.
I know that
All I Need is You.

(Repeat)

Nothing compares with all that You are
In Earth and Heaven.
Nothing can stand without Your hand
You guide me through
The darkest night,
The bitter cold,
Your Hand Won't ever let me go.
In the darkest night,
the bitter cold
In Everything I've Come to Know
All I Need is You.---Lyrics submitted by carolyn page.
