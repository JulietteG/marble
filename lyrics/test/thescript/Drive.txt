Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late?
And who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
Oh, oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
Oh, oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
Oh, oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Tonight, yeah

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
Oh, oh
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?---
