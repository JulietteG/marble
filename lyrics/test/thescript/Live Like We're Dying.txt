Sometimes we fall down and can't get back up 
we're hiding behind skin that's too tough 
how come we don't say I love you enough 
till it's too late, it's not too late 

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come 
we could make a feast from these crumbs 
and we're all staring down the barrel of a gun 
so if your life flashed before you 
what would you wish you would've done 

Yeah... gotta start 
lookin' at the hand of the time we've been given here 
this is all we got and we gotta start thinkin' if 
every second counts on a clock that's tickin' 
gotta live like we're dying 

Yeah we got 
86 400 seconds in a day to 
turn it all around or throw it all away 
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em 
while we got the chance to say 
gotta live like we're dying 

And if your plane fell out of the skies 
who would you call with your last goodbyes 
should be so careful who we let fall out of our lives 
so when we long for absolution 
there'll be no one on the line 

Yeah... gotta start 
lookin' at the hand of the time we've been given here 
this is all we got and we gotta start thinkin' if 
every second counts on a clock that's tickin' 
gotta live like we're dying

We only got 
86 400 seconds in a day to 
turn it all around or throw it all away 
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em 
while we got the chance to say 
gotta live like we're dying 

Like we're dying oh-- like we're dying [x2] 

We only got 
86 400 seconds in a day to 
turn it all around or throw it all away 
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em 
while we got the chance to say 
gotta live -- like we're dying 

You never know a good thing till it's gone 
you never see a crash until it's head on 
all these people right when we're dead wrong 
you never know a good thing till it's gone 

Yeah... gotta start 
lookin' at the hand of the time we've been given here 
this is all we got and we gotta start thinkin' if 
every second counts on a clock that's tickin' 
gotta live like we're dying 

We only got 
86 400 seconds in a day to 
turn it all around or throw it all away 
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em 
while we got the chance to say 
gotta live like we're dying 

Like we're dying oh -- like we're dying [x2] 

We only got 
86 400 seconds in a day to 
turn it all around or throw it all away 
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em 
while we got the chance to say 
gotta live like we're dying 
live like we're dying---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
