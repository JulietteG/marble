If you wake up and dont want to smile 
If it takes just a little while 
Open your eyes and look at the day 
Youll see things in a different way 

Dont stop thinking about tomorrow 
Dont stop 
Itll soon be here 
Itll be better than before 
Yesterdays gone 
Yesterdays gone 

Why not think about times to come 
And not about the the things that youve done 
If your life was bad to you 
Just think what tomorrow will do 

Dont you look back 
Dont stop 
Dont you look back 
Dont stop 
Dont you look back 
Dont stop 
Dont you look back now 

All I want is to see you smile 
If it takes just a little while 
I know you dont believe that its true 
I never meant any harm to you 

Dont stop thinking about tomorrow 
Dont stop 
Itll soon be here 
Itll be better than before 
Yesterdays gone 
Yesterdays gone 

Dont you look back [x8]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
