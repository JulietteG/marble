Finger on the pump make the sixth straight jump from SoCal

Chronic smoking, get burnt by the California sun
On the west side, east coast where ya at?

To London, to Brazil, to Quebec
Like the whole damn world took effect to Ferg

Laid back slow down

From the plaques to the uh uh
Everything fat
Got Mustard on a track
My girls all stack
When I roll down the window, let me know where youre at
Atlanta, North South kick it lac
Texas grill, Cadillacs through Miami then back
To London, Jamaica then France
The whole damn world took effect to Ferg
