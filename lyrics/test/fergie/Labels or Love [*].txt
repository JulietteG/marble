Fergie Labels Or Love Lyrics

Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, its all Im thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
1,2,1,2,3, Turn the lights off!

I already know what my addiction is
I be looking for labels, I aint looking for love
I shop for purses while I walk out the door
Dont cry, buy a bag and then get over it
And, Im not concerned with all the politics
Its a lot of men I know I could find another one.

Oughta know that Im always happy when I walk out the store, store
Im guessing Supercalifragi-sexy, nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, just Im trying to walk a mile in my kicks

(Chorus)
Loves like a runway but which one do I love more
No emotional baggage, just replace it with Dior
Loves like a runway, so whats all the fussing for
Lets stop chasing them boys and shop some more
1,2,1,2,3,Turn the lights off!

I know I might come off as negative
I be looking for labels, I aint looking for love
Relationships are often so hard to tame
A Prada dress has never broken my heart before
And, Boy________
Imma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing
Cause I know that my credit card will help me put out the flames
Im guessing Supercalifragi-sexy, nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, just Im trying to walk a mile in my kicks

[Chorus]

Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer things
Men they come a dime a dozen, just give me them diamond rings
Im into a lot of bling, Cadallic, Chanel and Coach
Fellas boast but they cant really handle my female approach
Buying things is hard to say
Rocking Christian Audigier, Manolo, Polo, taking photos in my Cartier
So we cant go all the way, I know you might hate it but
Im a shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love---Lyrics submitted by Sammy.
