Standing on a ledge see the past before me
Pick out all the bruises one by one
Feel a little cold but theres warm there somewhere
But not where you come from

Staring at my face in a broken mirror
Pick up all the pieces make them one
You might be strong, but youll never hurt me
Theres nothing stronger than love

Kick me down, break my skin
Call me names call me anything
So come on try your best to hurt me
Youll never see me suffering

Im unbreakable
Im stronger than Ive ever known
Im unbreakable
Youre never going to bring me down down down

Life is like a puzzle spread out on the table
Maybe Im the piece that will never quite fit
Say what you want but youll never phase me
I quite like me like this

Kick me down, scrape my skin
Call me names youll never win
Sticks and stones could never cut 
through my thick skin

Im unbreakable
Im stronger than Ive ever known
Im unbreakable
Youre never going to bring me down down down
Youll never change me, Im standing on a higher ground
Im unbreakable
Youre never going to bring me down down down

I see a light in the tunnel and it fades you out
The angel on my shoulders gonna shut you down
Help me fight every battle till you go away
I will never break

I am not you victim you cant hurt me
Here I stand with my head held high---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
