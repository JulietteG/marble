You pick on the weak
Your twisted tongue speaks
All the fears you hide
The fear inside
You think I dont see
Youre not talking to me
Im the mirror, the knife
The fear inside

But I get stronger everyday
One wrong will be all it takes
My powers fed by your hate
One wrong will be all it takes

My fight is won
Who needs a gun
Boom boom knock you out
You knocked me down
But whos laughing now
Boom boom knock you out

My fight is won
Who needs a gun
Boom boom knock you out
You knocked me down
But whos laughing now
Boom boom knock you out

Boom boom knock you out

And the bullys best friend
Is the poison pen
But you can't touch me
While you sit at home
Plan attacks all alone
You try to phase me

But I get stronger everyday
One wrong will be all it takes
My powers fed by your hate
One wrong will be all it takes

My fight is won
Who needs a gun
Boom boom knock you out
You knocked me down
But whos laughing now
Boom boom knock you out

Boom boom knock you out

Boom boom knock you out---
