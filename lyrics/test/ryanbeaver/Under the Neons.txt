 (Verse 1)
The nights all run together, one right into the next,
and each night I sit here on this bar stool
play my songs for tips. The faces have grown cold, 
and the smiles have turned to stares.
If I was a gambling man I'd bet that they don't care. 

 (Chorus)
That I'm under the neons, burning away.
Yes I'm under the neons, just giving my heart away.
Oh I'm under the neons, pouring out my soul
How much more can I give them I just don't know.

 (Verse 2)
They tell me to keep on playing, say they like to hear my songs.
I know that they hear me, but are they listening at all?
I get this empty feeling, that I'm just spining my wheels.
One look around this bar room, and I can't help but feel.

(Chorus)
That I'm under the neons, burning away.
Yes I'm under the neons, just giving my heart away.
Oh I'm under the neons, pouring out my soul
How much more can I give them I just don't know.

I'll be under the neons, burning away.
Yes I'm under the neons, just giving my heart away.
Oh I'm under the neons, pouring out my soul
How much more can I give them I just don't know.
Oh I just don't know, just don't know.---Lyrics submitted by Eric.
