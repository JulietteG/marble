My life was as empty
As the bottle by my bed
My friends turned into strangers
And I was all but dead 
Jesus came and found me there
That day those demons bled
When my life was as empty
As the bottle by my bed

My first taste of the spirit
Brought me to my knees
I knew that I was helpless
I prayed Lord help me please
Each time was the last time
That's what I always said
When my life was as empty 
As the bottle by my bed

(Chorus)
By my bed
Everthing seemed further
   out of reach
And in my head
Oh I found it hard
To practice what I preached
Now I'm going back home
It's down this path I'm led
And I'm no longer empty
Like the bottle by my bed 

Sometimes this road gets lonesome
And I wish that I could fly
Don't be afraid to stop me
When I pass you by
We'll sit and watch the sun go down
As the waters turn to red
If you like I could tell you
About the bottle by my bed

(Chorus)
By my bed
Everthing seemed further
   out of reach
And in my head
Oh I found it hard
To practice what I preached
Now I'm going back home
It's down this path I'm led
And I'm no longer empty
Like the bottle by my bed---Lyrics submitted by Dayla.
