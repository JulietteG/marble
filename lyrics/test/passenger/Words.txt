Well the first time that I saw her,
Standing in the middle of the road,
Eyes as bright as christmas lights,
Wearing someone elses clothes,
I did my best to ignore her,
But ignoring my best pretty soon,
We spent the night all tangled tight,
In an armchair in my friends front room,

I said darling you know,
Darling you know I cant stay,
Cos I've given my heart and my word to a girl far away,
I felt week as she kissed my cheek,
And sighed when I heard her say,
Never knew I could get my heart broken in less than a day,

Oh and the next time that I saw her,
Must have been a year or more,
Face stained with mascara,
Shivering outside my door,
I did my best to assure her,
But assurance isnt easy to give,
If youve never been sure of anything much,
And get less so the longer you live

She said darling you know,
Darling you know I cant stay,
Cos I've given my heart and my word to a boy far away,
I spoke soft and pretended to cough,
Like I didnt care either way,
Never knew I could get my heart broken in so many ways,

And the last time I saw her,
Standing in the pouring rain,
Hair a little shorter,
But everything else looked the same,
I couldve told her that I adored her,
She couldve said she felt the same way,
But we just smiled cos sometimes words,
Arent the right words to say,
We just smiled cos sometimes words,
Arent the right words to say.---
