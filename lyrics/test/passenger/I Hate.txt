Well I hate Racist blokes, telling tasteless jokes
and explaining where people belong.
I hate ignorant folks, that pay money to see gigs
and talk trough every fucking song
I hate people in nightclubs,snorting coke
and explaining where you're going wrong.

Well if you agree, then come hating with me
and feel free to sing along

and it goes:

And I hate pointless status-updates on facebook,
f y i we were never m-8-tes
we pretend to be friends on the internet when,
in real life we have nothing to say,
to eachother oh brother I have love for my mother,
for good times, for music and my mates
yeah I love and I live and I have love to give
but sometimes all you can do is hate.

Well I hate them fast eaters, the cooked up foreheaters,
they only eat pizza and chips
I hate stepping outside for smoking, some guy coughs, 
but your longs are his
And I hate giving up, for festival toilets, 
especialy when you need to shit
And I hate the x-factor, for murdering music
You bunch of money-grabbing pricks

and it goes: 
lai la la la lai
la la la lai 
la la la lai 
la la la lai 
la la la lai 
la la la lai 
la la la la

And I hate them magazines aim for insecure teens,
and make ten-year-olds race to grow up
hey kids let's all be anorexic, 
or better eat chocolat until you throw up
keep your holywoodstart and their stupid cars and the botox
that makes them look fucked
just grow old with grace
have you seen cher's face? it looks like it's been hit by a truck

and it goes: 
lai la la la lai
la la la lai 
la la la lai 
la la la lai 
la la la lai
