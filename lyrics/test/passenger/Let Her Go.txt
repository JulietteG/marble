Well you only need the light when its burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know your love her when you let her go
Only know youve been high when youre feeling low
Only hate the road when youre missin home
Only know your love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
The dreams come slow and it goes so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch slowly dies

But you only need the light when its burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know your love her when you let her go
Only know youve been high when youre feeling low
Only hate the road when youre missin home
Only know your love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
Because love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But to never to touch and never to keep
Because you loved her to much
And you dive too deep

But you only need the light when its burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know your love her when you let her go
Only know youve been high when youre feeling low
Only hate the road when youre missin home
Only know your love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Ooooo ooooo oooooo
And you let her go
Ooooooo ooooo ooooo
And you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when its burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know your love her when youve let her go
Only know youve been high when youre feeling low
Only hate the road when youre missin home
Only know your love her when you let her go
And you let her go---Lyrics submitted by Emma Bates.
