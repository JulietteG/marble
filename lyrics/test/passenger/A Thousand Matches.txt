Black is the color of my true love's hair
Her lips are like the roses fair
She's the sweetest smile the gentlest hands
I love the ground on where she stands
I love the ground on where she stands

Lying on the mattress 'cause my friend's crazy sister took my bed away
Sleeping, she looked like an actress, a theory I didn't practice, I said "There's got to be a better way"
She said: "You light a thousand matches when you finally set fire when you run away
So why'd you go and do it when you knew that you would go and I would stay"

I hit the wall in frustration, the conversation had been circling for days
She said: "Don't take it out on him, for the wall has always been supportive in the best of ways"
We're laughing and crying like mad men dying in the snow
For just one second it was funny that she would have to stay and I would go

She said "I love you know I love you so, when you love someone well you've got to let them know."
And I said: "Nothing's changed I love you the same, but when you love someone sometimes you gotta let them go."

She handed me a stone in the perfect shape of a heart
She said: "I'm gonna take this home for I know you'll only lose it somewhere after dark
'Cause some faces so terribly seem to lose everything you own."
She didn't mean it how it sounded, what she meant was she would stay and I would go

And I said: "I love you know I love you so, when you love someone well you've got to let them know"
She said: "Nothing's changed I love you the same, but when you love someone sometimes you gotta let them go"

Sometimes you tear it all apart, to see the wood from the trees
Sometimes you break your own heart to set yourself free

I walked her to the station, hesitation in our movements and our tongue
Words finally left after realizing how uncomfortable they've grown
What you want and what you need, well they seldomly succeed to grow
We reluctantly agreed that when you love someone, you've got to let them go---
