I know a man with nothing in his hands, nothing but a rolling stone
He told me about when his house burnt down, he lost everything he owned
He lay asleep for six whole weeks, they were gonna ask his mother to choose
When he woke up with nothing he said Ill tell you something
When youve got nothing, youve got nothing to lose

Now Ive got a hole in my pocket, a hole in my shirt, a whole lot of trouble, he said
But now the money is gone, life carries on and I miss it like a hole in the head

I know a woman with kids around her ankles and a baby on her lap
She said one day her husband when to get a paper and the mother fucker never came back
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise, keeping the wolf from the door
She said the wolfs just a puppy and the doors double locked so why you gotta worry me for

Now he left a in hole in my heart a hole in a promise a hole on the side of my bed
Oh now that hes gone well life carries and I miss him like a hole in the head
Well sometimes you cant change and you cant choose
And sometimes it seems you gain less than you lose
Now weve got holes in our hearts, yeah weve got holes in our lives
Well weve got holes, weve got holes but we carry on

Well weve got holes in our hearts, yeah weve got holes in our lives
Well weve got holes, weve got holes but we carry on
Said weve got holes in our hearts, yeah weve got holes in our lives
Well weve got holes, weve got holes but we carry on

Said weve got holes in our hearts, weve got holes in our lives
Weve got holes, weve got holes but we carry on
Said weve got holes in our hearts, weve got holes in our lives
Weve got holes, weve got holes but we carry on

Said weve got holes in our hearts, yeah weve got holes in our lives
Well weve got holes, weve got holes but we carry on---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
