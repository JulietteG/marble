Well sing, sing at the top of your voice
And love without fear in your heart
Feel, feel like you still have a choice
If we all light up we can scare away the dark

We wish our weekdays away 
Spend our weekends in bed
We Drink ourselves stupid and work ourselves dead
And all because thats what mum and dad said we should do
We should run through the forests 
We should swim in the streams 
We should laugh we should cry we should love we should dream
We should stare at the stars and not just at screens
You should hear what Im saying and know what it means to

Sing at the top of your voice
And love without fear in your heart
Feel, feel like you still have a choice
If we all light up we can scare away the dark.


Yeah we wish we were happier, thinner and fitter
We wish we werent losers and liars and quitters
We want something more not just nasty and bitter
We want something real not just Facebook and twitter
Its the meaning of life and its streamed live on YouTube 
But I bet Gangnam Style would still get more views
Were scared of drowning, of flying and shooters
But were all slowly dying in front of fucking computers.

Sing at the top of your voice
And love without fear in your heart
Feel, feel like you still have a choice
If we all light up we can scare away the dark.

And oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh ahh

And oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 


Sing it out now 

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh 

Sing it out now

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Claudia Holbrook.
