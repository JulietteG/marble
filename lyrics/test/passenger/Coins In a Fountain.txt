Fear is dark but my love is a lantern
Shining up like coins in a fountain
Hope is a tree sitting on a mountain where the grass dont grow
Theres a sad old sea but my love is an island
Wild and free like the hills in the highlands
Hope is a breeze that brings me back to dry land
Where the flowers grow

Love is a baby born
Love is the last unicorn
Love is the only song ill sing

Hate is a poison
Love is a remedy
Singing out like the sweetest of melodies
Hope is a ghost in the deepest of memories
Stronger than ten of me
Fear is the enemy
In the dark and it creeps like a shark
In the coldest sea
In the deepest part but
Hope is the beat in the oldest heart
A hand in a hand and a brand new start

Love is a fireside
Warm on the coldest of nights
Love is the only song Ill sing
Love is the truest of words
Love is the last winter birds
Love is the only song Ill sing

Oh Ill sing
Til I cant sing no more
Oh Ill sing
Til my throat is sore ---
