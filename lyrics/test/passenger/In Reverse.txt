This is the life i got to live
This is the time that I can give
The efforts that I make
Are just so that you won't escape

Feels like I'm falling
Like this would never ever change
I just keep stumbling
I am the fool in your charade

Sleep is an overrated thing
Something to do when I know I win
Let me know when its time to go
I have a lot of things to show---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
