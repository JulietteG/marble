Australian man, Scandinavian tan,
kicking stones round a square.
Sat for a while and carved out a smile,
as if someone would care.

Said Im a long way from the Gold Coast.
For this dive ever known,
Oh and this just aint my home.
It was my wife, my dear but shes no longer here.
She left me travelling alone.

I never heard silence, ring out like a bell.
I never heard silence, like last night in my expensive hotel.
Well Im loving a shadow, Im trying to catch the rain.
But I never heard silence, till I heard it today.

She walked out of the hotel,
I could still smell the smoke,
of the burning heart left inside.
She said men are all assholes
And lifes a bad joke.

She laughed and started to cry.
See, ten years with this man,
and a life time of plans,
oh, and I loved him to his bones.
Now I have lines on my skin and he has traded me.
He left me travelling alone.

Well I never felt silence, hear me like a train.
I never felt silence, like blood caused through my veins.
Well Im loving a shadow, and Im trying to catch the rain.
I never heard silence, till I heard it today.
I never felt silence, till I felt it today.---
