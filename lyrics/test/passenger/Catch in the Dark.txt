Well she calls me up when shes broken,
Says to leave my front door open,
I come home to find her smoking,
With her eyes all fragile and thin,
Shes always been hopeless at hoping,
Always coped badly with coping,
And I never know when shes joking,
She never lets anyone in,

I know Im a fool to let her run away with my heart,
And shell never tire of these games,
Loving her is like playing catch in the dark,
Im a tear drop in an ocean of flames,

And well drink too much for a Wednesday,
Shell ask me why none of her men stay,
I tell her just what her friends say,
It never goes down too well,
And shell stay hear til late in the evening,
But shes always arriving or leaving,
Never decides to believe in,
The people who know her so well,

I know Im a fool to let her run away with my heart,
And shell never tire of these games,
Loving her is like playing catch in the dark,
Im a tear drop in an ocean of flames,

She says if were single at 40,
Well get married and move to the country,
But I know shell never want me,

Then its five fifteen in the morning,
I reach for her whilst Im yawning,
She leaves me with no warning.---
