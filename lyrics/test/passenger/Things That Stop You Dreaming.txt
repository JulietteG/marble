I got no money in my hand, or my coat, or my pocket,
Won't get to space 'cos I haven't got a rocket,
But I've air in my lungs, eyes in my sockets,
And a heart that beats like a tap that leaks,
In the night when you haven't got a plumber who can stop it,
Jack-in-the-box without a key to lock it,
Well this boat may sink but I'm not gonna rock it cos the sea doesn't know my name,
Yeah the boat may sink but I'm not gonna rock it cos the sea doesn't know my name.

Well if you can't get what you love,
You learn to love the things you've got,
If you can't be what you want,
You learn to be the things you're not,
If you can't get what you need,
You learn to need the things that stop you dreaming,
All the things that stop you dreaming.

Well I've got no one's word and nobody's promise,
Not a lot to show but this book full of sonnets,
And my liver may be f**ked, but my heart is honest,
And my word is true like the sky is blue,
In the summertime when everybody gets on it,
Warm my skins and get sunburnt from it,
And her eyes shine bright like a sky full of comets that shoot like silver trains,
Yeah her eyes shine bright like a sky full of comets that shoot like silver trains,

Well if you can't get what you love,
You learn to love the things you've got,
If you can't be what you want,
You learn to be the things you're not,
If you can't get what you need,
You learn to need the things that stop you dreaming,
Oh Oh, All the things that stop you dreaming.

Oh, oh oh oh, no, 
oh, oh oh, oh oh,
o o o oh, no, oh, oh,
oh oh no,

Well if you can't get what you love,
You learn to love the things you've got,
If you can't be what you want,
You learn to be the things you're not,
If you can't get what you need,
You learn to need the things that stop you dreaming,
Oh Oh, All the things that stop you dreaming.
All the things that stop you dreaming.---Lyrics submitted by GeorgiaMatthews.
