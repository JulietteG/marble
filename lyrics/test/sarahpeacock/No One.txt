This is how I feel, so trapped inside this ordinary box.
Everyone around me seems to get along fine.
If this is how it's gonna be, I want no part in this purgatory.
It's time to make some change and break down a couple of walls.

CHORUS:
I'm worth more than what they say I am.
And what they say I am shouldn't matter to me.
I was born to make a difference; I was born with something to say.
And no one's gonna stop the world from hearing me.

I can't believe how we can let our dreams just slip on by.
It's scary just to think how easy it is to let them die.
All you have to do is listen to just one or two of those.
Voices that are telling you, "You're never gonna make it."

CHORUS:
I'm worth more than what they say I am.
And what they say I am shouldn't matter to me.
I was born to make a difference; I was born with something to say.
And no one's gonna stop the world from hearing me.

BRIDGE:
It's not an easy pill to swallow,
Dreaming about tomorrow.

CHORUS:
I'm worth more than what they say I am.
And what they say I am shouldn't matter to me.
I was born to make a difference; I was born with something to say.
And no one's gonna stop the world from hearing me.

I was born to make a difference; I was born with something to say.
And no one's gonna stop the world from hearing me.
Yeah, no one's gonna stop the world from hearing me.
Yeah, no one's gonna stop the world from hearing me.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
