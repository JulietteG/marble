I can see the ocean in your eyes.
Reaching as far as the open sky.
I can taste the teardrops on your face
Softly they puddle in this place.

CHORUS:
Kiss me all night. Say it's alright.
Hold me so tight. Bathe in the moonlight.
And please let me be your angel baby.
And I will love you always.
And I swear with all that I have.
That you would never be alone.
If I was your angel.

I could spend forever going nowhere.
Running my fingers through your hair. 
I could spend a lifetime in your smile.
Growing old and grey all the while as you

CHORUS:
Kiss me all night. Say it's alright.
Hold me so tight. Bathe in the moonlight.
And please let me be your angel baby.
And I will love you always.
And I swear with all that I have.
That you would never be alone.
If I was your angel.

CHORUS:
Kiss me all night. Say it's alright.
Hold me so tight. Bathe in the moonlight.
And please let me be your angel baby.
And I will love you always.
And I swear with all that I have.
That you would never be alone.
If I was your angel.
Oooh, if I was your angel.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
