Here I am 
there you are 
why does it seems so far
next to you is where I should be,
(where I want to be)


Something I want so bad
know whats inside your head
maybe i can see what you see,
I got to keep on believing 
that everything takes time
I'll make up any reason to make you mine
if your staying or leaving I'll follow your lead 
so why keep pretending 
open you eyes I can
be what you need.


Any kind of guy you want
girl that's the guy I'll be 
turn myself upside down
(yes I will, yes I will)
any kind of guy you want girl you know
I''ll agree turn your whole
world around
(yes I will,yes I will)
any kind,any kind,any kind
of guy you want, you decide
change your mind 
I will be there won't you try one more time 
be my any kind of girl
you decide it's alright
I will be there.


Let me know if I'm getting through
I'm making you understand
if it's wrong I'll try something new
don't look away 'cause
I'm here to stay
if it's a game than I'm gonna play

Any kind of guy you want girl 
that's the guy I'll be 
turn myself upside down
(yes i will,yes i will)

Any kind, any kind 
any kind of guy you want you decide, change your mind , I will be there.---Lyrics submitted by meleena.
