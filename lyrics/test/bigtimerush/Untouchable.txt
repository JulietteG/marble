I can see you in the window
Waiting for my car
With the moonlight shining on you
You look so beautiful

We were searching for that something
That we could call our own
But they tell us that we're too young
And we need to let it go

Ooh, I can barely breathe
Ooh, come run away with me

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
No hurry 'cause a love like this is forever (forever)
They don't even know a thing
We'll show 'em all that we're much better together (together)
The love we got is so untouchable

Got the whole world up against us
They wanna see us fall
But our love is like a castle
They can't break down the walls, no

Like a force field all around us
Two hearts will keeps us strong
Yeah you got me and I got you
We're so untouchable

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
No hurry 'cause a love like this is forever (forever)
They don't even know a thing
We'll show 'em all that we're much better together (together)
The love we got is so untouchable

Imagine us in paradise, somewhere only we know
And in that place, we'll live our lives
We're so untouchable, yeah
Ooh, come run away with me

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
No hurry 'cause a love like this is forever (this is forever)
They don't even know a thing
We'll show 'em all that we're much better together (better together)
The love we got is so...

Don't you worry 'bout a thing
No hurry 'cause a love like this is forever (forever)
They don't even know a thing
We'll show 'em all that we're much better together (together)
The love we got is so untouchable---Lyrics submitted by Christian J.
