Do you want to ride in a big limousin? 
tell me do you want to take a little bite of the fame machine 
if you wanna be discovered end up on the cover, 
of every star studded super market magazine 

You can do it stick right to it,
It could happen tonight 

Course:

You wanna be famouse (famouse),
you wanna be the one who's living the life 
you wanna be famouse (famouse), 
you wanna be the one who's taking the free ride. 

Do you want to cut in front of the line 
baby do you need to... 
see your name in lights just like the Hollywood sign 
come on we got to work harder fight the fight together 
take it to the top of the winning team 
it's your momment you can own it it's the american dream 
all day all night the camreas on and it never lies 
your under the spotlihgt twenty-four seven 
til' the end of time woohh o ohh 
you wanna be famouse x2 

you wanna be famouse your song is on the radio 
hot rotation video bright lights fan mail paparazi on your tail tour  
bus private jet thinking big aint felt you yet 
just one thing you can't forget it takes more than just one man 
aim higher never rest put your passion to the test 
give your all never less  famouse means that your the best---Lyrics submitted by kalhiana.
