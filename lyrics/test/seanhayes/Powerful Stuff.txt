Oh yes this is powerful stuff
Got me circling like the moon round the sun
Got me acting like a fool on a drunk
Hear me this is powerful stuff

No way for you to give this up
It is in your body
It is in your blood
Tear you down
Lift you up
Keep you turning like it's never enough

All right then let us turn it up
Everyday do like a flower does
Sun rises and she opens up
Sun rises and she sings

Hit me

This is powerful
Powerful
Powerful



Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
When a thing is so strong
You can' t give it up
Won't give it up

Got you
Turning
Yearning
Burning

Can't give it up
Won't give up
Even when your
Turning
Yearning
Burning

Can't give it up
Won't give it up

Powerful stuff---Lyrics submitted by angelica.
