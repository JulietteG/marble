Calling all cars, calling all cars
Calling all broken hearts
Come on go out tonight
Shake it out

Calling all cars, calling all cars
Calling all broken hearts
Come on go out tonight
Shake it out

We're in the same boat, you & I
Two broken hearts, big wild eyes
With so much love to give
I sure am glad I ran into this

You and your t-rex t-shirt
And your soulful eyes
You shook me out from the night
You took me out for one night

I want to thank you, thank you
I want to thank you, thank you
Thank you, I want to thank you

Calling all cars, calling all cars
Calling all broken hearts
Come on go out tonight
Shake it out

Calling all cars, calling all cars
Calling all, calling all
Well, come on go out tonight
And tear it down

I want to thank you, thank you
I want to thank you, thank you
Thank you, I want to thank you

Sweet morning love
Rainy morning love

With your sashay and your bright smile
And you're sexy with your fine style

And your sashay and your bright smile
And you're sexy with your fine style

And your sashay and your bright smile
And you're sexy with your fine style

Come on go out tonight, shake it out
Come on go out tonight, tear it down
We're going to go out tonight, shake it out
We're going to go out tonight

Come on go out tonight, tear it down
Come on go out tonight, shake it out---Lyrics submitted by gi.
