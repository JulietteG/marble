A patient glance, a forgiving mind
But she always wonders where he is this time
He lives everyday in a different key with harmonies and melodies
A couple more weeks and he'll be home again

(Chorus)
The promise holds true, when he has no means
Hopes and her dreams will be a reality
He'll always know, that its meant to be
She's the only girl that he will ever need

Both pockets have holes, can't sift his last
To afford a postcard attached to a stamp
She deserves a companion when he's not around
Maybe with black paws and spots of brown
A couple more weeks and he'll be home again

(Chorus)

The calendars marked on till September
There's one more thing for her to remember
However many miles away he'll go there's one thing left for sure
The road will always lead to her

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by aaron.
