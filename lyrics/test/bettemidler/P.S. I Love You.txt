Dear i thought i'd drop a line
The weathers cool 
The folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at 9
P.S I Love You

Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all 
I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train
P.S I Love You

Write to the Browns just as soon as your able
They came around to call
I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see, I guess thats all

Nothing else for me to say
And so i'll go
Oh but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
P.S I Love You
P.S I Love You---Lyrics submitted by Stacey.
