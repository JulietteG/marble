Otto Titsling, inventor and kraut
Had nothing to get very worked up about
His inventions were failures, his future seemed bleak
He fled to the opera at least twice a week

One night at the opera he saw an aida
Whose bust was so big it would often impede her
Bug eyed he watched her fall into the pits
Done in by the weight of those terrible tits

Oh my God, there she blows
Aerodynamically this girl was a mess
Otto eyeballed the diva lying comatose amongst the reeds
And he suddenly felt the fire of inspiration flood his soul
He ran back to his workshop where he futzed and futzed and futzed

For Otto Titsling had found his quest
To lift and mold the female breast 
To point the small ones to the sky
To keep the big ones high and dry
Every night he'd sweat and snort
Searching for the right support
He tried some string and paper clips
Hey he even tried his own two lips

Well he stitched and he slaved and he slaved and stitched
Until finally one night in the wee hours of morning
Otto arose from his workbench triumphant
Yes!  He had invented the worlds' first over the shoulder boulder holder
Hooray!

Exhausted but ecstatic Otto ran out to the diva 
Bearing the prototype in his hot little hands
But little did Otto know at the moment of his greatest triumph
Lurking under the diva's bed 
Was none other than the very worst of the French patent thieves
Phillipe DeBrassiere
And Phil was watching the scene with a great deal of interest

Later that night while our aida slept 
Into the wardrobe Phillipe softly crept
He fumbled through knickers and corsets galore
'Til he found Otto's titsling and he ran out the door
Crying "Oh my God, what joy what bliss
I'm gonna make me a million from this!
Every woman in the world will want to buy one!
I will have all the goods manufactured in Taiwan!"

The result of this swindle are pointedly clear
Do you buy a Titsling?
Or do you buy a Brassiere?---Lyrics submitted by Eva.
