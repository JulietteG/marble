Maybe you and I see life with two different visions...
Neither one of us is wrong or right.
Maybe we're too serious, and don't wanna listen...
I just wanna make you laugh tonight.

We are like, day and night, night and day...
We are both so different in so many ways.
We are like, night and day, day and night...
And we go together just like black and white.

Seems you're always out one door, when I'm in the other...
It's so hard to find some quiet time (so hard to find the time).
Wish we could spend our lives alone with each other...
Never think about the world outside.

We are like, day and night, night and day...
We are oh, so different, in so many ways.
We are like, night and day, day and night...
Still, we know it's gonna be alright.

And if we never really get the picture right...
How many of us ever really win the fight?
I never wanna lose your love, or let the distance get the best of us...
'Cause time is moving fast enough.

Maybe we don't always share a common opinion...
It's true that you and I don't think alike.
But when I look into your eyes, and all is forgiven (All is forgiven)...
All I wanna do is hold you tight.

We are like, day and night, night and day...
We are both so different in so many ways.
We are like, night and day (night and day), day and night...
Still, we know it's gonna be alright.

We are like, night and day (night and day), day and night...
And we go together just like black and white.

We are like (we are like) x2
Day and night (day and night), night and day (night and day) x2

We are like (we are like) x2
Day and night (night and day), night and day (day and night) x2---Lyrics submitted by Edward Castille.
