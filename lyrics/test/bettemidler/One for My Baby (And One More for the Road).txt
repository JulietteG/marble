Quarter to three
There's no one in the place
Except you and me
So go set 'em up Joe
Gotta little story I think you should know
We're drinking my friend 
Til' the end
Of a sweet episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

Got the routine
So drop another nickel
In the machine
Oh gee, I'm feeling so bad
Why don't you make the music 
So dreamy and sad
You can tell me a lot
But it's not
In a gentleman's code
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

You may not know it
But buddy, your a kinda poet
And you've had a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy
You always listen to me
Until it talks away

Well that's how it goes
And John I know your getting
Anxious to close

So thanks for the cheers
I hope you didn't mind me
Bending your ear

For all of the years
For the laughs
For the tears 
For the class, that you showed

So make it one for my baby 
And one more for the road...
That long, long road...---Lyrics submitted by sarah.
