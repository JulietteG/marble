When the white bird flies
from your heart to mine,
I surrender every part of me
to the tenderness.

Could it be the wine?
In your eyes stars shine,
and I'm feeling like
a child again.
Oh, it's taken me a little time
to find words to say

Stay.
Make this forever,
and lay love in my life.
Come what may,
cherish each moment of love
as dreams go by.

If the first glow fades
from the love we've made,
I will hold you
closer in the night
under heart and key.

When there are hills to climb,
and your world won't rhyme,
I will fight until I
get it right;
'Cause your part of me,
the heart of me,
if only you'll stay.

Stay.
Make this forever,
and lay love in my life.
Come what may,
cherish each moment of love
as dreams go by.

The trees and the
towers are burning.
Fear walks on the sea.
My soul in the
wasteland is yearning.
What does tomorrow hold for me?
Oh, no.

What can I say?
Just that I need you.
With you here by my
side, we can turn even
the desert evergreen
as dreams go by.

Oh, won't you stay?
Make this forever,
and lay love in my life.
Come what may,
cherish each moment of love
as dreams go by.

Stay.
Make this forever.
Lay love in my life.
Come what may,
cherish each moment of love
as dreams go by.---Lyrics submitted by Sonja.
