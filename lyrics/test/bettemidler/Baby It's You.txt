It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kissed that tears me apart

OH, Many, many, many nights roll by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself, myself
'Cause, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you

You should hear what they say about you? (cheat cheat)
They say you've never, never ever, been true

OH, It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do?
When it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you

Oh, It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do?
When it's true
I don't want nobody, nobody
Oh, oh baby, it's you
Baby, it's you

Don't leave me alone
Come on home
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
Only you
Baby, it's you---
