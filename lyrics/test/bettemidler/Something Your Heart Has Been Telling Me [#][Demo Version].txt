Last night I heard you calling
I heard you calling out a name I did not know
Woke up and tears were falling 
Yes tears were falling	
All around my bed of woe
          (chorus) 
Heres the situation
Right  before my eyes , I cant ignore
Your new infatuation
But I knew it long before

There is something your heart 
Has been telling me
But its something I already know
Youre a man who conceals
All the things that he feels
And wont let go  even though
Theres a love burning inside of you
With a flame so fierce and so bright
But I know you so well
I just had to tell you tonight

Today, the day is dawning
You sit in silence
In the half light of the room
Outside the sun is shinning
I keep on smiling trying hard 
To pierce the gloom
         (chorus)
Heres the situation
Right before my eyes - I cant ignore
Your new infatuation
But I knew it long before

There is something your heart 
Has been telling me
But its something I already know
Youre a man who conceals
All the things that he feels
And wont let go  even though
Theres a love burning inside of you
With a flame so fierce and so bright
But I love you so well
I just had to tell you tonight

Think of the water neath the bridge
Sailing a boat against the tide
Think of the love that we have lived
And of the times we cried
Give it all a half a chance
And we will be alright

There is some thing  my heart 
Has been telling me
But its something I already know
Why try to conceal
All the things that you feel
And not let go  even though
Theres a love burning inside of me
With a flame so hot and so bright
Oh  I love you so well
I just had to tell you tonight---Lyrics submitted by Liz.
