Sisters, sisters, there were never such devoted sisters, 
never had to have a chaprone, no sir. I'm there to keep my eyes on her, 
caring, sharing, every little thing that we are wearing, when every certain gentalman 
arrives from rome, she wore a dress and I stayed home. Lord help the mister! who 
comes between me and my sister! and lord help the sister! who comes between 
me and my man!! who comes bewteen me, and my man!! sister!!---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
