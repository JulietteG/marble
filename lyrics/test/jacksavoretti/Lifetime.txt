We will all say goodbye
But that's alright
Happens to everyone
The "alright" part is a lie
But that's alright
We tell it to everyone
If you feel like you're wasting your time
Waste it if you want to
The reason does not have to rhyme
Waste it if you want to

There's only so much you can do in one lifetime
Take it easy
There's only so much you can do in one lifetime
Oh, take it easy

Now the sun is bound to go down
But thats alright
It happens every night
Tomorrow it comes back around
But thats ok
It happens everyday

If you feel like you're wasting your time
Waste it if you want to
The reason does not have to rhyme
Waste it if you want to

There's only so much you can do in one lifetime
Take it easy
There's only too much you can do in one lifetime
Oh, take it easy

Waste it if you want (x3)
There's only so much you can do in one lifetime
Take it easy
There's only too much you can do in one lifetime
Oh, take it easy

There's only so much you can do in one lifetime
Take it easy
There's only too much you can do in one lifetime
Oh, take it easy

Take it easy
Oh, take it easy---Lyrics submitted by Luca Walravens.
