Living in your absence
I see memories of when I cried
I hear songs in the key of silence
I'm not ready yet to die

Every breath I laugh out loud
like a poem window line
It means nothing to me now
Itll mean everything in time

Oh this crazy superstition
Youll find love just you wait your turn
I ain't got no time for intuition
Lets build this bridge together watch it burn

Looking back at my sweet life
In an empty dirty glass
I can see the men in white
Telling tales about the past

Such a dangerous game to play
Only way to be
Ask me nicely I might stay
Will you run away with me

Oh this crazy superstition
Youll find love just you wait your turn
I ain't got no time for intuition
Lets build this bridge together watch it burn

Living in your absence
I see memories of when I cried
I hear songs in the key of silence
I'm not ready yet to die

Oh this crazy superstition
Youll find love just you wait your turn
I ain't got no time for intuition
Lets build this bridge together watch it burn
Lets build this bridge together watch it burn
Lets build this bridge together watch it burn ---
