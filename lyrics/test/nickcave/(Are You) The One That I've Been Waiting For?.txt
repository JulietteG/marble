I've felt you coming girl, as you drew near 
I knew you'd find me, cause I longed you here 
Are you my destiny? is this how you'll appear? 
Wrapped in a coat with tears in your eyes? 
Well take that coat babe, and throw it on the floor 
Are you the one that I've been waiting for? 

As you've been moving surely toward me 
My soul has comforted and assured me 
That in time my heart it will reward me 
And that all will be revealed 
So I've sat and I've watched an ice-age thaw 
Are you the one that I've been waiting for? 

Out of sorrow entire worlds have been built 
Out of longing great wonders have been willed 
They're only little tears, darling, let them spill 
And lay your head upon my shoulder 
Outside my window the world has gone to war 
Are you the one that I've been waiting for? 

O we will know, won't we? 
The stars will explode in the sky 
O but they don't, do they? 
Stars have their moment and then they die 

There's a man who spoke wonders though I've never met him 
He said, 'he who seeks finds and who knocks will be let in' 
I think of you in motion and just how close you are getting 
And how every little thing anticipates you 
All down my veins my heart-strings call 
Are you the one that I've been waiting for?---Lyrics submitted by Di.
