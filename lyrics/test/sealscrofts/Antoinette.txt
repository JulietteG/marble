In the city, Naples by the sea. Antoinette of Naples waits for me.
Through the flower-scented gardens, down the steps into the street.
Through the meadow down by the sea, to the secret place where we shall meet.

In the dreamland, Naples by the sea. Antoinette of dreamland waits for me.
Pretty lace upon her bonnet shades the softness of her skin.
I almost thought I heard her calling from the distance
Or could it be the wind?

In the city, Naples by the sea. Antoinette of dreamland waits for me.
Through the flower-scented gardens, down the steps into the street.
Through the meadow down by the sea, to the secret place where we shall meet.---Lyrics submitted by deb.
