Somebody walked into my life and he's right on time 
Somebody looked into my eyes and he read my mind 
And it's true I only need to tell you that it's you
Your everything I've ever dreamed would come to me.

Somebody walked into my heart and to my surprise
Somebody's tearing me apart and it feels just fine 
And it's you, I've waited oh so long to say it's you
Your everything I ever dreamed 

And tonight I give in to the feelings
Tonight I give in to the thrill of loving you
Tonight I give in to believing
I'd hear you say you'll always stay

Somebody turned my life around
And I'm not the same 
Suddenly I don't hear a sound 
Only your name
And I really need you 

Tonight I give in to the feelings
Yes tonight I give in to the thrill of loving you 
Tonight I give in to believing 
We'll always stay in love this way

OHhhho!!!

Tonight I give in to the feelings 
Yes tonight I give in to them all, so help me
Tonight I give in to believing, darling
Your everything I ever dreamed would come to me, to me 
Somebody walked into my life.....---Lyrics submitted by Tammy.
