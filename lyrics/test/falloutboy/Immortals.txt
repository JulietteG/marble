They say we are what we are
But we dont have to be
Im glad to hate you but I do it in the best way
Ill be the watcher of the eternal flame
Ill be the guard dog of all your fever dreams

I am the sand, bottom half of the hourglass
(Glass, glass)
Ill try to picture me without you but I cant
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long

If we meet forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals, immortals, immortals, immortals
Immortals

Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when its tested again and again everyday
Im still comparing your past to my future
It might be over, but theyre not sutures

I am the sand, bottom half of the hourglass
(Glass, glass)
Ill try to picture me without you but I cant
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long

If we meet forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals, immortals
Immortals

And if we meet forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals, immortals, immortals, immortals

Immortals ---
