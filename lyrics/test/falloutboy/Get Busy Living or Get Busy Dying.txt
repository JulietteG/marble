This has been said so many times befor and i'm not sure if it matters
but we never stood a chance and i'm not sure if it matters
if you are the shores i am the waves begging for big moons
im adding letters to addresses in a ghost town 
no
(chorus)
Your secrets out
I know this hurts 
It was ment to (it was ment to)
Your secrets out
and the best part it isnt even a good one
and its mine over you 
dont dont matter
(verse)
This has been said so many times and im not sure it matters
But it must be said again that all us boys are just streaming
Into microphones for attention because we're just so bored
We never knew that you would pick it appart 
Oh I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts
(chorus)
Your secrets out
i know this hurts 
it was ment too
Your secrets out 
and the best part is
its not even a good one
and its mine over you
dont dont matter
(bridge)
I used to obsess over living
Now i only obsess over you
Tell me you'd like boys like me better
In the dark lying on top of you
this has been said so many times 
that im not sure if it matters
(chorus)
I know this hurts 
It was ment too
(it was ment too)
your secrets out and the best part is
Isnt even a good one 
and its mine over you Dont
Dont Dont Dont Matter---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
