I can't explain a thing
I want everything
To change and stay the same
Oh Time doesn't care about anyone or anything
Oh come together, come apart
Only get lonely when you read the charts

Oh baby, when they made me
They broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around
Then I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care

I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Though change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
Oh we will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand

I'm a mascot for what you've become
And oh oh I love the mayhem more than the love

And oh baby, when they made me
They broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around
When I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care

I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Though change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
Oh we will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand

Throw your cameras in the air
And wave 'em 'cause I just don't care
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave 'em 'cause I just don't care

I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh change will come
Oh change will come
I will never believe in anything again

We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
Oh we will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand
