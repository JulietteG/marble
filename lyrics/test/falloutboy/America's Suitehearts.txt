You couldve knocked me out with a (feather)
I know youve heard this all before
but were just hells (neighbors) ooooooh
Why why why wont the world revolve around me
Build my dreams please grow all over the streets
But I dont know much about classic cars (cars)
but I got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke)
Down, Set, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hike
Media Blitz

Lets hear it for Americas Suitehearts
But I must confess Im in love with my own sins
Lets hear it for Americas Suitehearts
But I must confess Im in love with my own sins


You can bow and pretend
that you dont dont know youre a legend
Time time time hasnt told anyone else yet
Let Let my love loose again
I dont know much about classic cars (cars)
but I got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke)
Down, Set, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hike
Media Blitz

Lets hear it for Americas Suitehearts
But I must confess Im in love with my own sins
Lets hear it for Americas Suitehearts
But I must confess Im in love with my own sins

You couldve knocked me out with a (feather)
I know youve heard this all before

Lets hear it for Americas Suitehearts
But I must confess Im in love with my own sins
Lets hear it for Americas Suitehearts
But I must confess Im in love with my own sins---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
