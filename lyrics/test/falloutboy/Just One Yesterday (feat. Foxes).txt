I thought of angels
Choking on their halos
Get them drunk on rose water
See how dirty I can get them
Pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings

Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
It will be held against you

If heavens grief brings hells rain
Then Id trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know Im bad news, I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still Id trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know Im bad news, I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday

Letting people down is my thing baby
Find yourself a new gig
This town aint big enough for two of us
I dont have the right name
Or the right looks
But I have twice the heart

If I spilled my guts
The world would never look at you the same way
Im here to give you all of my love
So I can watch your face as I take it all away---
