Get on the dance floor baby
Its time to get it on
So youve had some troubles lately
You better deal after dawn
Let the music take you somewhere
Give yourself some room
If you wanna catch some air
Youre gonna have to show all your moves

Girls move your body right or left
Find your pocket
Youre gonna have to break a sweat
To be on it
Listen baby

Keep on trackin with me
Everybody swayin to the beat
Keep on trackin with me
Cant stand still
Gotta move your feet
Keep on trackin with me
Everybody swingin in the heat
Keep on trackin with me
Gotta keep up
To join this party

No pride in bein a shaker
Work it out on the floor
This rhythm shows no flavor
Better check your ego at the door
Just let me be the leader
Keep your eyes on checkin me
You wont need to take a breather
Sliding into motion naturally

Dont let your body miss a beat
Dont be slackin
If youre keepin up with me
Youll be trackin


Girls move your body right or left
Find your pocket
Youre gonna have to break a sweat
To be on it
Listen baby

Keep on trackin with me
Everybody swayin to the beat
Keep on trackin with me
Cant stand still
Gotta move your feet
Keep on trackin with me
Everybody swingin in the heat
Keep on trackin with me
Gotta keep up
To join this party

Keep on trackin with me
Everybody swayin to the beat
Keep on trackin with me
Cant stand still
Gotta move your feet
Keep on trackin with me
Everybody swingin in the heat
Keep on trackin with me
Gotta keep up
To join this party---Lyrics submitted by Daven.
