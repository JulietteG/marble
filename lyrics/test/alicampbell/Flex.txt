I love the way you flex
I like the way you stay
Never know whats coming next
When your coming to play 
But I'm willing to bet
Go as far as to say
Hey Hey Hey

You keep coming back 
Coz you can't keep away
You Can't keep it up
You Can't keep it down
You can't disguise the way you feel
When I am around 
I can't walk away
I can't concentrate
I can't imagine you and me
Not staying up late 

I love the way you flex
I like the way you stay
Never know whats coming next
When your coming to play 
But I'm willing to bet
Go as far as to say
Yeah Yeah Yeah

You keep coming back 
Coz you can't keep away
You know what I mean
You know what I say
You get where I'm coming from
When I go away 
We just get it on
We just burnin bright
We just stick together
Everything is alright 

I love the way you flex
I like the way you stay
Never know whats coming next
When your coming to play 
But I'm willing to bet
Go as far as to say
Yeah Yeah Yeah

You keep coming back 
Coz you can't keep away
I've gotta move on
I gotta get rest
I gotta let you know
Exactly just how I flex 
You see that I'm here
You see I'm not there
You see through me when
I pretend that I don't really care 

I love the way you flex
I like the way you stay
Never know whats coming next
When your coming to play 
But I'm willing to bet
Go as far as to say
Yeah Yeah Yeah
You keep coming back 
Coz you can't keep away 
You keep coming back
You keep comin back
You keep comin back 
Coz you can't keep away---Lyrics submitted by cjsutherland.
