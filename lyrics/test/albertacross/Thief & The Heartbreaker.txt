Destruction shows 
These broken years 
That heaven shows 
you are a stranger here 
In this lonesome strain 
The angels calling you 
In this lonesome strain 
the angels calling 

From my hometown 
A lying heartbreak 
you and my heartbreaker 
You and my heartbreak 

From my hometown 
A lying heartbreak 
you and my heartbreaker 
You and my heartbreak


Time has changed 
to something new 
That we must find 
where we must go 
My only friend 
mistreated blues 
my only friend
mistreated blues 

From my hometown 
A lying heartbreak 
you and my heartbreaker 
You and my heartbreak 

From my hometown 
A lying heartbreak 
you and my heartbreaker 
You and my heartbreak---Lyrics submitted by gypsy.
