Woman I wished you
more than I should 
Woman I wished you
more than some would 
Oh my worlds been 
a minor fool 
Even a miner burn of my soul

And I 
I just wanna live 
I just wanna live 
is that a crime 
To live life in asylum

Oh my word this is all 
after all 
Even death passes all my calls

And I 
I just wanna live
I just wanna live
is that a crime
to live life in asylum 

More
I just want more
I just want more 
is that a crime---Lyrics submitted by gypsy.
