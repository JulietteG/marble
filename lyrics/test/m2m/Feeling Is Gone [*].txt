The feeling is gone
Listen to me as I explain this situation
Its not like I wanna destroy his reputation
We're still together
But we are not moving on

When we first met it was the perfect combination
Now when I look at him it fills me with frustration
What is a girl to do when she is not having fun

[CHORUS]
How can I tell him I have to try
There is no easy way of saying goodbye
How do I break it
Its just no good
My heart is telling me that I really should
I must be subtle
I must be strong
the feeling is gone

I think we're in the oppisette direction
No longer think that we are making a connection
I am so unhappy
I'd rather be alone

In the beginning it was one special occasion
Now when I talk to him his mind is on vacation

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]

I want it over all said and done
How can I tell him that he isn't the one
I must be subtle
I must be strong
the feeling is gone---Lyrics submitted by zie.
