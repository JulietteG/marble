it's been a really, really messed up week
7 days of torture, 7 days of bitter
and my girlfriend went and cheated on me
she's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her.

la, la, la, whatever.
la, la, la, it doesn't matter.
la, la, la, oh well.
la, la, la

we're goin at it tonight, tonight,
there's a party on the rooftop top of the world.
tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of Hollywood sign.
i don't know if i'll make it,
but watch how good i'll fake it.
it's alright, alright, tonight, tonight.

i woke up with a strange tatoo. 
not sure how i got it, not a dollar in my pocket.
and it kinda looks just like you, mixed with zach galifianakis.

uh, la, la, la, whatever.
la, la, la, it doesn't matter.
la, la, la, oh well.
la, la, la

we're goin at it tonight, tonight,
there's a party on the rooftop top of the world.
tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of Hollywood sign.
i don't know if i'll make it,
but watch how good i'll fake it.
it's alright, alright, tonight, tonight.

you got me singing like woah, come on, ohh,
it doesn't matter, woah, everybody now, ohh.

just dont stop, let's keep the beat pumpin',
keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down.
it's my party, dance if i want to.
we can get crazy, let it all out.

just dont stop, let's keep the beat pumpin',
keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down.
it's my party, dance if i want to.
we can get crazy, let it all out.

it's you and me and we're runnin' this town.
and it me and you and we're shakin' the ground.
and ain't nobody gonna tell us to go, cuz this is our show!

everybody, woah, come on. ohh, all you animals. 
woah, let me hear you now, ohh.

tonight, tonight, there's a party on the rooftop top of the world.
tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of Hollywood sign.
i don't know if i'll make it,
but watch how good i'll fake it.
it's alright, alright, tonight, tonight
it's alright, alright, tonight, tonight
yeah, it's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

just singing like woah, come on, ohh, all you party people.
woah, all you singletons, ohh, even the white kids.

just dont stop, let's keep the beat pumpin',
keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down.
it's my party, dance if i want to.
we can get crazy, let it all out.

just dont stop, let's keep the beat pumpin',
keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down.
it's my party, dance if i want to.
we can get crazy, let it all out it's...---Lyrics submitted by Ema.
