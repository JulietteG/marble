Please tell me baby, it's not a mistake.
Please tell me baby, it's not a mistake.
I'm an honest man, I know how to wait.
So please tell me baby, it's not a mistake.
There is no language for how I feel.
There is no language for how I feel.
When I look at you, standing there, none of this seems real,
There is no language for how I feel.

Cause we're looking for a way, to make it better.
Cause we're looking for a way, to change the weather.
Whether you or I survive tonight, I promise you that I will love you like
we're gonna live forever.

There ain't a thing that can change my mind.
There ain't a thing that can change my mind.
Let the tower fall, I'll play the fool, and leave everything behind.
There ain't a thing that can change my mind.

Cause we're looking for a way, to make it better.
Looking for a way to change the weather.
Whether you or I survive tonight, I promise you that I will love you like
we're gonna live forever.

When everything breaks open, everything breaks down,
Wider and wider, the spaces between.
We look in the dark, to wonder, does it make sense to stop now?
Hold the line, Hold the line

Cause we're looking for a way, to make it better.
Looking for a way to change the weather.
Whether you or I survive tonight, I promise you that I will love you like
we're gonna live forever.
(looking for a way) gonna live forever
(looking for a way) to change the weather
Whether you, or I, survive tonight, I promise you that I will love you like
we're gonna live forever.---Lyrics submitted by jamie.
