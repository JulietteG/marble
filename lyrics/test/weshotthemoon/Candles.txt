I'll blow the candles out
Wish for a different life.
We'll say familiar words
And feel the weight of time.

Lay your body, down to rest.
And blow the candles out
Wish for a different life.
Keep on crawlin'.

Here's to another year
That came and passed on by.
And left you jealous here (---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
