We got beer iced down in a cooler
Truck radio crankin' Hank Jr.
Everybody's gettin' looser
Son, look what ol' Burley's got
Boys we're about to kick her up a notch
With

Shine!
Straight from a mason jar
Shine!
Let's let the party start
Shine!
We do it right in these parts
Everybody have a good time
Take a sip and pass it down the line
Shine!

This old hay field just came alive
Everybody's dancin' by the fireside
We're gonna be here all night
I think I've had a little too much
But it's hard to have just enough
When you got

Shine!
Straight from a mason jar
Shine!
Let's let the party start
Shine!
We do it right in these parts
Everybody have a good time
Take a sip and pass it down the line
Shine!

That Carolina sun is risin'
And we're still standin'
Might as well kick off the morning with some

Shine!
Straight from a mason jar
Shine!
Let's let the party start
Shine!
We do it right in these parts
Everybody have a good time
I said, everybody have a good time
With 

Shine!
Straight from a mason jar
Shine!
Let's let the party start
Shine!
We do it right in these parts
Everybody have a good time
Take a sip and pass it down the line
Shine!
