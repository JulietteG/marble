Well brought lots of bread baby, posing in my car 
All the birds love me, they know I'm a star
I know where it's at baby in this here town
I'm whats happening, I can't be put down 
I ain't no fool Maintaining my cool
Watch me while I got my own bag
(He's got his own bag)
Those who imitate me are just good crack
(He's got his own bag)
Aint no fool. Maintaining my cool

SOLO
Ooooooh give it to em baby
I like it like that
How sweet it is yeeeeah

Well all I need is wine, women and shore
(Wine, women and shore)
The lovelies chase me all day long
(Wine, women and shore)
Ain't no fool
Maintaining my cool
Ain't no fool
Maintaining my cool
Yeah
And push it---Lyrics submitted by pete.
