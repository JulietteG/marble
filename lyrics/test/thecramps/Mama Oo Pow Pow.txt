Mama oo pow pow, who's gunna twist and shout, mama oo pow pow, who shot that la la out, your gamagoochi's got the gagas and your hoochie coochie's hangin' out girl you could use a good spankin, and baby so could I, I love to hear the scream of the butterfly, now I don't wanna be your dear sweet friend - I just wanna beat your little pink rear end
mama oo pow pow, who's gunna twist and shout, mama oo pow pow, baby I'll give you something - something to cry about now girl you ain't goin' nowhere in them kinky boots, I'll eat your heart out like an aztec baby I don't give a hoot... lured by beauty, destroyed by sex, there's still room in hell for whoever comes next---
