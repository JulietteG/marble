You gotta look, in the mirror
To see what you have'a become
Nothing to be'a proud of
Once again'a here I stand'a folded arms
Lookin at'a what'a we used to feel
Because I am the one
Who would travel to the sun
Hoping to find a greater being in me...

A piece of me wanted to be in your world
But I knew it couldnt be
Because my greed wouldn't let me settle

Let me out of here, let me out of my body
I find it hard to let myself go yet I know I shouldn't care

Walking around I hear the sounds of happiness
And I wish I was the one who
Trophy in hand became the man
Maybe you'd wish for me to be
Because I am the one
Who would travel to the sun
Hoping to find a greater being in me

A piece of me wanted to be in your world
Yet I knew it couldn't be
Because my greed wouldn't let me settle

Let me out of here, let me out of my body
I find it hard to let myself go yet know I shouldn't care
Let me out of here, let me out of my body
I find it hard to let myself go yet I know I should
I shouldn't care, shouldn't care, shouldn't care

Let me out of here, let me out of my body
I find it hard to let myself go yet I know I shouldn't care
Let me out of here, let me out of my body
I find it hard to let myself go yet I know I shouldn't care

I shouldn't care, I shouldn't care
cause I am the one, who will travel to the sun
I can't help myself---Lyrics submitted by Maciej Wilczyski.
