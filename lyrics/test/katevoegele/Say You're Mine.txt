I bit my tongue for too long
my patience gets a bit thin.
I gotta tell you the way that it is.
I think you know this is something different we've started.
We're more than ordinary.
There's something about the way that the world looks
brighter when I'm next to you.

Chorus
No one's gonna love you like I will.
Darlin' you can just take your time.
And I've been burning up like a wildfire,
wishing you would just say, say, say you're mine.
End Chorus

Let's get ourselves out of town,
we'll take the last train out
I got a million things I wanna know.
It's easy baby with us, there's nowhere we can't go
and this love it doesn't scare me,
'cause I'm running out of reasons not to feel this.
I can tell you're dying to try.

Repeat Chorus

Don't you wonder what it'd be like
underneath the streetlights
you and me.
With the city wrapped around us
if no one ever found us
it's fine with me.

Repeat Chorus---Lyrics submitted by Lori Moss.
