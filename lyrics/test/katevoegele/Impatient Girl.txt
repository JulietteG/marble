I been holding on
for eternity.
Waiting on your love.
I let you lead me on,
so perfectly.
Well, I think I've had enough
I'm tired of dancin' around it,
I'm not wired that way.
I'm gettin' fired up thinkin' about it.
Gotta be honest,

Chorus:
I ain't never been a patient girl, baby,
I ain't built like this.
The way you're takin' your time
has got me jumpin' ship.
And I won't lie, let's call this what it is;
an impatient girl waitin' on an empty wish.
End chorus

Baby, I'm allowed
to want an answer now.
Wouldn't you say that's fair?
Can you help me out,
'cause I'm breakin' down.
Oh, do you even care 
that I'm losing my mind every minute?
Don't you do me like that.
Don't you know you're pushing
my heart to the limit?
Won't you listen?

Repeat chorus

And I won't spend the rest of my life
hoping for a sign,
you can't just leave me out to dry.

Oh, I ain't built like this.
The way you're takin' your time
has got me jumpin' ship.
And I won't lie, let's call this what it is;
an impatient girl waitin' on an empty wish.---Lyrics submitted by Lori Moss.
