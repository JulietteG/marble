In fairness I was an easy sell
Though I'm embarrassed
To admit it to myself
And the worst part is
You know it all too well
So don't take advantage
Of my transparent shell, no

But I think you know what I need
Impossible as it may seem
And I think it's easy to see

I am awake, it's getting late
I'm in no state to be alone now
Yeah, I'm alone now
Come light the fire in my room
I think I'm losing all control now
I don't even know how
But I'm in your rip tide
And now I'm inside out

I'm in the corner of the street cafe
And my heart is warmer
Since I heard from you today

Like a shallow creek I am gleaming
No chance of keeping any secrets
Have I lost enough security yet?

I am awake, it's getting late
I'm in no state to be alone now
Yeah, I'm alone now
Come light the fire in my room
I think I'm losing all control now
I don't even know how
But I'm in your rip tide
And now I'm inside out

I tried to hide it, I can't deny it
Now I'm inside out
Say you love me, yeah, all or nothing  oh
Now I'm inside out

I am awake, it's getting late
I'm in no state to be alone now
Yeah, I'm alone now
Come light the fire in my room
I think I'm losing all control now
I don't even know how

I am awake, it's getting late
I'm in no state to be alone now
Yeah, I'm alone now
Come light the fire in my room
I think I'm losing all control now
I don't even know how
But I'm in your rip tide
And now I'm inside out---Lyrics submitted by Bri.
