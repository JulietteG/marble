Far in the distance
This is the view from the other side
How did I let this pass me by
You took me from granted,
Planted thorns in this garden of mine.
What are the chances my hope has died
Please have mercy
You unnerved me
I don't deserve this pain, no.

So don't break my heart
I ain't never done
Nothing to deserve this
I'm torn apart
You've had your fun
Do you suppose I earned it
Do you not see
How I'm begging on my knees
don't speak, don't breathe,
You bring out the Devil in me oh oh

Thinking it over
Those were days dark as ebony night
The end of October felt like a life time
I had a suspicion
But I didn't want to believe you a lair
You had a mission
To prove me right.

You took my trust
Ground it to dust
Found out I know better. Yea-yeah.

So don't break my heart
I ain't never done
Nothing to deserve this
An I'm torn apart
You've had your fun
Do you suppose I earned it
Do you not see
How I'm begging on my knees
don't speak, don't breathe,
You bring out the Devil - oh

And I don't wanna feel the pain
And I don't want another day
Shackled to your ball and chain.
You're entirely to blame
An acquired misery 
All I can do is wait 
all I can do is wait  

So I don't have a pair if there is 
No charity in your heart
Couldn't you spare me, I've done my part 

So don't break my heart
I ain't never done
Nothing to deserve this
An I'm torn apart
You've had your fun
Do you suppose I earned it
Do you not see
How I'm begging on my knees
don't speak, don't breathe,
You bring out the Devil -

So don't break my heart
I ain't never done
Nothing to deserve this
I'm torn apart
You've had your fun
Do you suppose I earned it?
Do you not see
How I'm begging on my knees?
No don't speak, don't breathe,
You bring out the Devil in me
Devil in me, Devil in me---Lyrics submitted by Tasha.
