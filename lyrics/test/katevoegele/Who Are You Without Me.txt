Put me up on a pedastal
I've got nowhere to go but down
You expect the impossible
And it's too much to carry around

Well you tell me I'm beautiful
It feels empty and I don't why
But it seems that you're searching me
For something you're not gonna find

I'm not your anchor, so don't hold on
I'm not the answer, you got me wrong
I'm not your savior, save your energy
To find out who are, yeah who you are without me

Ooohh

Wide awake lying next to you
Being careful to get the words right
See it hurts me to tell you this
But it kills me to keep it inside

And I'm alone with the present tense
Making plans is overrated to me
And I don't speak in guarantees
Or at least not the kind that you need

I'm not your anchor, so don't hold on
I'm not the answer, you got me wrong
I'm not your savior, save your energy
To find out who you are, yeah who you are without me

Oooh
Well I still believe in happy endings
But this just isn't where I wanna spend mine
I believe in now I've said it
Oooooh

I'm not your anchor, so don't hold on
I'm not the answer, you've got me wrong
I'm not you savior, save your energy
To find out who you are

I'm not a mirror, look inside yourself
I'm not a hero, you know too well
I'm not your savior, save your energy
To find out who you are, who you are without me

Yeah yeah yeah
Oooh---Lyrics submitted by Bri.
