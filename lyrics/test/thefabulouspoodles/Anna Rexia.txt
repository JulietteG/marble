My sweet little Anna Rexia
Skinny little teenage queen
She won't eat anything put in front of her
She wants to look like an ad man's dream
Always goes out on her own
Little girl's thinner than skin and bones
My sweet little Anna Rexia
Surely gonna waste away

Sweet little Anna Rexia
What am I to do with you?
(unintelligible)

Nothin' left for me to do
Made appointments with a shrink
Took me to the very brink
My sweet little Anna Rexia 
Surely gonna waste away

Hello hello hello hello
That little girl's got a (unintelligible-prepubescent?) manner
Hello hello hello hello
I'm makin' love to a bagful of spanners 
Every day she's gettin' thinner and thinner
She won't touch a bite of her dinner
She used to be my one any only
Now she's even thinner than-a Bony Maroney

Sweet little Anna Rexia
Skinny little teenage queen
She won't eat anything put in front of her
She wants to look like an ad man's dream
She got bones stickin' out at every angle
Looks like she's been fed into a mangle
My sweet little Anna Rexia
Surely gonna waste away

Hello hello hello hello
That little girl's got a (unintelligible-prepubescent?) manner
Hello hello hello hello
I'm makin' love to a bagful of spanners 
Every day she's gettin' thinner and thinner
She won't touch a bite of her dinner
She used to be my one any only
Now she's even thinner than-a Bony Maroney

Hello hello hello hello 
That little girl's got a (unintelligible-prepubescent?) manner
Hello hello hello hello 
I'm makin' love to a bagful of spanners
Hello hello hello hello
I'm makin' love to a wham-a-dama wham-a-dama
Hello hello hello hello-oh....---Lyrics submitted by Don Ewes.
