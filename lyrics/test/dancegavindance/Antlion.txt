Somethings wrong, Somethings wrong
There's a bomb in my face, decorated in white lace
Somethings wrong, Somethings wrong
When people they look at you, Do you think
do you think of food?

Somethings wrong, Somethings wrong
There's a bomb in my face, decorated in white lace
Somethings wrong, Somethings wrong
When people they look at you, Do you think
do you think of food?

Stretch yourself as far as this will go at night
Follow when I row
(Carving out some lungs with a stake
Brontosaurus tracks, relax)
Hey is that your lady?
She gave it willingly
hey wait I've got the parts, to fix your head, to fix your head to fix
She gave it willingly
hey wait I've got the parts, to fix your head, to fix your head to fix your head

wait right here, I'm going to explode
wait right here, I'm exploding
I've got to be in your car
I'm still shooting even par

Stretch yourself as far as this will go at night
Follow when I row
(Carving out some lungs with a stake
Brontosaurus tracks, relax)
Hey is that your lady?
She gave it willingly
hey wait I've got the parts, to fix your head, to fix your head to fix
She gave it willingly
hey wait I've got the parts, to fix your head, to fix your head to fix your head

Somethings wrong, Somethings wrong
There's a bomb in my face, decorated in white lace
Somethings wrong, Somethings wrong
When people they look at you, Do you think
do you think of food?

Somethings wrong, Somethings wrong
There's a bomb in my face, decorated in white lace
Somethings wrong, Somethings wrong
When people they look at you, Do you think
do you think of food?---Lyrics submitted by Brissa.
