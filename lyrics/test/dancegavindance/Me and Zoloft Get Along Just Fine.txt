Ask me, I'm fine or I will be
I got a bullet-proof vest on and the cure for AIDS
and a pill that makes me happy

Ask me, I'm fine or I will be
I've got the cure for loneliness 
and a pill that makes all my problems resolved

I got a bullet-proof vest on
and I wiretapped your brain
I want to do this right
Dyno... dynomite

You should have just listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now
I thought we told each other to live in different worlds

Oh, you should have listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now, over this by now

(Well, sure it's complicated, but I still know) Oh, there's only so much I can take
(that I can get frustrated and snort that blow) But I guess we'll never really find out
Never really find out

Rate me and judge me on a graph that you drew
Hope I compare to the friends that left you for dead

I guess I'm not making myself perfectly clear
I guess I'm not making myself perfectly clear
How many times...
How many times...
How many times is this gonna happen?
How many times...
How many times...
How many times is this gonna happen?

I've got to blame all these people as fast as I motherfucking can
You were fooled, this ain't no fucking day job

Oh, you should have listened to your friends
You would have been over this by now, over this by now

(Well, sure it's complicated, but I still know) Oh, there's only so much I can take
(that I can get frustrated and snort that blow) But I guess we'll never really find out
Never really find out

Suddenly, we startle ourselves
Staring upon each other in silence, silence
To think this whole time, we're provoking each other in blinding violence---Lyrics submitted by Bob.
