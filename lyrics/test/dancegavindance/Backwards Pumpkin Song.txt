Sit down, call off the cavalry
I'm stealing the jewels
In a slow motion action replay
Bar fight, I invented chivalry
Notch in my bed post
Slow motion action replay.
Sit down, call off the cavalry
I'm stealing the jewels
In a slow motion action replay
Bar fight, I invented chivalry
Notch in my bed post
Slow motion action replay.

Now the fog is rolling in
Bringing us that much closer to a senseless end
Oh please don't get up
I'll get that for you.
It's selfish to say I'll believe when
I believe in all these lies
It's been long enough

Don't just lay on the ground, son
Don't just drown in the fountain
And I don't know you, I don't know you
You got stuck preaching action
I fell down using tact, son
And I don't know you, I don't know you

Don't just lay on the ground, son
Don't just drown in the fountain
And I don't know you, I don't know you
You got stuck preaching action
I fell down using tact, son
And I don't know you, I don't know you

Bring back this fight tonight
For all of these lies that I uphold (Don't mind them they can't elope)
For one good note (Leave them off of the great big boat)
Bring back this fight tonight
For all of these lies that I uphold (Don't mind them they can't elope)
For one false hope (Leave them off of the great big boat)
One false hope

Go on and fix your tie
And just lead the line out
Needless to say
I stumble, you play
All night long

Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say
Fix your tie and just lead the line out, needless to say

Bring back this fight tonight
For all of these lies that I uphold (Don't mind them they can't elope)
For one good note (Leave them off of the great big boat)
Bring back this fight tonight
For all of these lies that I uphold (Don't mind them they can't elope)
For one false hope (Leave them off of the great big boat)

Now you'll find as I rewind, now you'll find it's not the point
Now you'll find as I rewind, now you'll find it's not the point
Now you'll find as I rewind, now you'll find it's not the point
Now you'll find as I rewind, now you'll find it's not the point
