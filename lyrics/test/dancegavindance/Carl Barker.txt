There's no sense in me staying, then why does it matter?
It doesn't matter, it never matters.
I hope someday soon, maybe, we'll finish this chapter.
I can't ever finish this chapter.
And now at this moment, I don't know what else to think.
There's no sense in me staying.
I guess I still miss you.

So now I need names and faces.
Examine the suspects.
Get the D.A. here now.

You'll tell everyone that it's so much fun.
Say to all my friends, it never ends.
While we're driving through all the alleyways we picked up some happiness on the way.

I'll tell everyone that it's so much fun.
Say to all your firends, it never ends.
While we're driving through all the alleyways I picked up some happiness on the way.

Just because you move your hips, doesn't mean that you exist.
Just because you move your lips, doesn't mean that you exist.
Can we just take a fucking break?
'Cause I feel like I've got nothing left.

I guess I still miss you.
Oh well, it's me and you.
What else should we do, when talking is for functioning people?
I guess I still miss you, but talking is for functioning people.
I guess I still miss you...

You'd always say we'd win the lottery someday so I wouldn't have to go away.
I should have known that I had it all along, but I didn't know 'til you were gone.

Let's see you function now.
Touch your nose; jump around.

Footprints.
In God we trust.
Jes-you, Jes-me, Jesus.
Pick up ten sac; Orange Krush, two bottles, cups, and blunts.
What do scorned lovers do?
Dancing with all my crew.
Drink and drive life away.
Gamble with everyday.---Lyrics submitted by R.
