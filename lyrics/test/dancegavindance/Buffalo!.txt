Here is a lesson, stop trying to impress them
The look on her face is like, "No, no, no, no, no!"
Question answer question. No, question answer question
No one cares who you know know, know, know, know, know

Here is a lesson, stop trying to impress them
The look on her face is like, "No, no, no, no, no!"
Know who you are before you claim you're a star
For now, we are all just like, "No, no, no and no!"

And all that you said to me has left me with anxiety
Let's just keep this underneath
You speak of me in disbelief

This ain't no fucking day job
I don't just sit around
Counting all my money
This is how you go out
I don't just sit around
Counting all my money
This is how you go out
You go out like a bang

I envision your brain like a crashing car
The cable it just snaps holding up the elevator
This ain't no fucking day job
I don't just sit around
This is how you go out
You go out like a bang

Here is a lesson, stop trying to impress them
The look on her face is like, "No, no, no, no, no!"
Question answer question. No, question answer question
No one cares who you know know, know, know, know, know

Here is a lesson, stop trying to impress them
The look on her face is like, "No, no, no, no, no!"
Know who you are before you claim you're a star
For now, we are all just like, "No, no, no and no!"

Hello, my name is Jon fucking Mess
I wrote the script on getting you out of your dress
Would you like to go out sometime?
I'll tear open your body and break down your emotional guard
'Cause I like love, and it's no good to me if you don't reciprocate the feeling
If you don't give back, I'm crushed, I'll go out drinking

Go out drinking, drinking
Drinking, drinking
Drinking, drinking
Drinking, drinking
Drinking!---Lyrics submitted by tony.
