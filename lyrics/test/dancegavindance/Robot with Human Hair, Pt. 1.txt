Your eyes are bleeding
Your eyes are bleeding
Your eyes are bleeding
Your eyes are bleeding

And you wait for this world to come down
Because you know you're wrong
(Drenched in your blood)
(This crimes overdone)
(Step down and back away)
And you wait for this world to come down
Because you know you're wrong
(Drenched in your blood)
(This crimes overdone)
(Step down and back away)

And now you are so ashamed
(Step inside to candle lighting at the fireside)
To see that I have made it farther than you ever will
(Take your time, dinner won't be done in time)
You speak of riding wings (Here's some sex for all these whores)
Such talent wouldn't be entrusted to such little kids
Just keep your distance

And then I beg for him
To let you go, to let you go

(It seems like thievery) And you wait for us to say
(Doused in, doused in dye) Why you're here, and burning flesh
(Doused in, doused in dye) Is all we hope to accomplish
(Here's some sex for all these whores) While you wait for us to say
(Just keep your distance) Why you're here, and struggling arms
(Here's some sex for all these whores) Is all we hope to accomplish
Just keep your distance

Oh, I'm so flattered (Stand in line roll call is where the liars died)
To see you copy, see you wish you that could be just like us
(Take your time, the sinners will forget their lines)
Doused in, doused in dye...
Doused in, doused in dye polymorphic hemophilia is fine

Well, tonight, you burn for this
Red can, blue flame
I will watch you burn from every corner of this place
And I will see you squirm with pain and fate
Try to breathe with sulfur in your lungs
Try to breathe with smoke in your lungs
Make your own damn bed

(It seems like thievery) And you wait for us to say
(Doused in, doused in dye) Why you're here, and burning flesh
(Doused in, doused in dye) Is all we hope to accomplish
(Here's some sex for all these whores) While you wait for us to say
(Just keep your distance) Why you're here, and struggling arms
(Here's some sex for all these whores) Is all we hope to accomplish
Just keep your distance
