Caught between one thick line, 
I can never see in the dark
Can you see at all?
Can you see at all?
Can you see it all?

[x2]
And now you go (Slip me the vicodin)
This world is upside down
Night at the symphony
The bar is closing down 
And now you go 
Slip me the antidote
Empty the cash box out

[chorus]
And i don't know why
I don't know why i fight for you this way
Fight for you this way
Fight for you this way
(Take the call and quickly lie about)
(Who you've been seeing lately)
(Then forget about it all)

Stage lights are burning up
Running faster to this spot
Stare at these faces
Torn from all these places
That i won't go

Mace yourself, blame someone else
Fall face down, fluid leaking out your eyeballs
Mace yourself, blame someone else
It's okay, no one will believe you
Mace yourself, blame someone else
Fall face down, fluid leaking out your eyeballs
Mace yourself blame someone else 
It's okay no one will believe you now

And i believed your not okay
And i won't go far
And i believed your not okay

[chorus]

Hey girl, your the best
I'm a sucker, maybe i should fuck her now.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
