.:Chorus:.
I love New York City,
Oh yeah, New York City!
(Repeat)

.:Verse 1:.
Run it over, run them out,
Knock your block and tearing your town!
Move on corners, move around,
Talk no talk, breaking you down!

We are a corporation,
We are a company.
We cut hard, but we could not anyway.
We are your mother-father,
We are your final friend.
It never started and it won't end!

.:Chorus:.
I love New York City,
Oh yeah, New York City!
(Repeat)

.:Verse 2:.
Broken faces, burned and bent,
Deal our song for everyone dead.
Write on nothing, write your head,
Got no fear! Say it not said.

We are a population,
We are a factory.
We don't do, but we never did it anyway!
We are your mother-father,
We are your final friend.
You can't stop what you can't end!

.:Chorus:.
I love New York City,
Oh yeah, New York City!
(Repeat)

.:Bridge:.
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh,
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh,
New York! (New York!)
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh!

.:Chorus:.
I love New York City,
Oh yeah, New York City!
(Repeat)

.:Chorus 2:.
I love (I love!) New York City,
Oh yeah, (Oh yeah!) New York City!
(Repeat 4x)

.:End:.
I love (I love!) New York City!
Oh, no, New York City!---Lyrics submitted by Tommy.
