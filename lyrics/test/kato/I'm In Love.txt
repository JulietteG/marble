(Verse)
I dont care
Its time to let let let my heart decide
I dont care
Feels like Im dancing on all the clouds tonight

(Verse)
Here we go
There is a fire burning in my chest
Here we go
I hear the music playing in my head

(Bridge)
Im in another state of mind
Its like Im living in a fantasy
I like the way Im feeling tonight
Dont set me free

(Chorus)
So I, Im in love
Im love
Nobody ever made me feel this way
Im in love,
Yea, Im in love
Nobody ever made me feel this way

Nobody ever made me feel this way
Nobody ever made me feel this way
Nobody ever made me feel this way
Nobody ever made me feel this way

(Verse)
In the dark, yea
We can get closer, now were bound together
In the dark
Nothing can tear us apart

(Bridge)
Im in another state of mind
Its like Im living in a fantasy
I like the way Im feeling tonight
Dont set me free

(Chorus x2)
Cause I, Im in love
Im love
Nobody ever made me feel this way
Im in love,
Said Im in love
Nobody ever made me feel this way

I I I I I Im in love
I I I I I Im in love
I I I I I Im in love
I I I I I nobody ever made me feel this way

Nobody ever made me feel this way hey hey

(Chorus)
Cause I, Im in love
Im love
Nobody ever made me feel this way
Im in love,
Said Im in love
Nobody ever made me feel this way

Nobody ever made me feel this way
Nobody ever made me feel this way---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
