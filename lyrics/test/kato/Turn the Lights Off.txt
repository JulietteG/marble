I said oohh
Come on baby turn the lights off

Ooohh oohh
Cuz it's getting late

I said oohh
I know you're gonna try to hang tough

But oohh
You shouldn't hesitate

I had love to burn
You had a wounded heart
Eyes 'cross a crowded room
Should we let this start

I said oohh
Come on baby turn the lights off

Ooohh oohh
Cuz it's getting late

I said oohh
I know you're gonna try to hang tough

But oohh
You shouldn't hesitate

I had love to burn
You had a wounded heart
Eyes 'cross a crowded room
Should we let this start

I said oohh
Come on baby turn the lights off

Ooohh oohh
Cuz it's getting late

I said oohh
I know you're gonna try to hang tough

But oohh
You shouldn't hesitate

I said oohh
Come on baby turn the lights off

Ooohh oohh
Cuz it's getting late

I said oohh
I know you're gonna try to hang tough

But oohh
You shouldn't hesitate---Lyrics submitted by Anders.
