oooh____
The first time I looked 
In your eyes I knew
There was something special
Inside of you
You awakened my passion,
And my curiosity
You were so sincere
I knew you'd be there for me

oooh___
You gave me joy 
That I never knew
You were sent here to love me 
Cause I needed you
You help me get through
The worst times in my life
You shared my sadness,
My pain, my strive

Whenever I dreamed
The impossible dreams
You assured me that
They would come true
(they would come true)
You stayed in my corner
No matter what life would bring
And I pledged my love to you____oo

Chorus:
You are the piece 
Of the puzzle i need
To make my life
Full and complete
I love you so
And thanks for being
My best friend

oooh____
Just like the rain
Falling to the ground
You washed away
My doubts and
Turned my life around
You made everything good
In my life that was bad
Boy your the greatest
Friend that I ever had
I want you to be 
Right here beside me
Forever and a day
(and a day)
For you are my strength
You are my future
And I need you 
Here to stay
(here to stay)

repeat chorus

Bridge:
ooo____
What can I give you
in return for the hope
That you've given me
Just ask and whatever
You want it will be
It will be______ ooo_____

Chorus:
You are the piece
Of the puzzle I need
To make my life
Full and complete
I love you so
And thanks for being
My best friend

oh baby
You are the piece
Of the puzzle I need
To make my life
Full and complete
I love you so
And thanks for being
ooo girl I love you so
And thanks for being
ooo girl I love you so
And thanks for being
My best friend---Lyrics submitted by Latanya.
