Baptized with tequila on the day I was born
Started breaking hearts before too long
The way I make love, baby it aint fair
Last week I sent a doctor to intensive care

Cause Im a big lovin woman, thats what I was born to be
Better be a man and a half to handle me
Im a hoodoo honey, Im the queen of cool
Teach you things baby you dont learn in school

Im your biggest fan of she, Im your dream come true
Wont be much left when Im through with you
Cause Im a big lovin woman, thats what I was born to be
Better be a man and a half to handle me

A big lovin woman always treats you right
Jump back baby, hold on tight
Im the worlds best lover, pound for pound
Youll love the way I throw my weight around

My life got off to a real bad start
Got arrested young for stealing hearts
Went to town baby, didnt stay too long
Boys said that girl can do no wrong

Im a big lovin woman, thats what I was born to be
Better be a man and a half to handle me
Im a big lovin woman, thats what I was born to be
Better be a man and a half
Got to have a man and a half
You know I need a man and a half to handle me
Said Im big lovin woman
Said Im a whole lotta woman
Im a lot of woman
Said Im a big lovin woman
Said Im a whole lotta woman
Im a queen size woman
Im a big lovin woman---Lyrics submitted by Sue Nichols-Painter.
