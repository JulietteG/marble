Here I am
making life I'm over you
when I know I am
not that strong.
And there you are
saying that it's easy to
when days like these
they seldom come along

And look at me
pretending I can say goodbye when
even if I could,
if I would well
I could lie and say I'm leaving
but I'd just be fooling me again.
There's so much I still believe in
fool me again...

And if I knew
I could get away from you
I let you go and
not hold on.
And if you said
that you didn't love me then
tomorrow you'd
awake and find me gone

And look at me
pretending I can say goodbye when
even if I could
if I would well.
I could lie and say I'm leaving
but I'd just be fooling me again.
There's so much I still believe in
fool me again

I could lie and say I'm leaving
but I'd just be fooling me again
there's so much I still believe in
fool me again...
