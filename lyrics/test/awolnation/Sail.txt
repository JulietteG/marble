SAIL!

This is how I show my love.
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my ADD baby.

This is how an angel cries
Blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my ADD baby

SAIL!

SAIL!

SAIL!

SAIL!

SAIL!

Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself(Chorus: myself)
Blame it on my ADD baby

Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my ADD baby

SAIL!


SAIL!

SAIL!

SAIL!

SAIL!

Lalalalala Lalalalalaoooo
Lalalalala Lalalalalaoooo

SAIL!

SAIL!

SAIL!

SAIL!
