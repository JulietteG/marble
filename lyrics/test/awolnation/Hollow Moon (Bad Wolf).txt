Ive been running from it all my lifetime
Theres nothing wrong with you, Im searching for my right mind
Oh, you shouldve seen it they were resting on the restless
This happened, literally - woke up I was headless
I woke up I was headless

Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf dont bite no more
Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf dont bite no more
Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf dont bite no more
Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf dont bite no more
Ima make a Ima make a bad wolf Ima Ima bad wolf Ima make a bad wolf Ima Ima
Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf dont bite no more

Youre all still here

Motherfucker Ill be back from the dead soon
Ill be watching from the center of the hollow moon
Oh, oh my God I think I mightve made a mistake
Waiting patiently was waiting taking up space
We are waiting taking up space

The earth below is above my feet when the clock is laughing at me
When copy cats and the lazy brats are the last thing I want to see
No, my enemy is a friend of mine in a friendly place to be seen
Hey, you know I'll run away for a couple years just to prove Ive never been free

They will never find me here

Yeah

Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf dont bite no more---
