Ah ah
Ah ah
Man
Ah ah

Off in my head, lost off in my head
Off in my head, lost off in my head
Off in my head, lost off in my head
Off in my head, lost off in my head

Lost all my arms, lost lost all my legs
Lost is my heart, but my new soul stays
We're singing off in my head
Lost, off in my head
Off in my head, lost

Do we really know the way the wind blows, wind blows?
All we're really safe around are shadows, shadows
Do we really know the way the wind blows, wind blows?
All we're really safe around are shadows, shadows
Through our windows

Off in the red, dance, dance with the dead
Off in the red, dance, dance with the dead
Off in the red, dance, dance with the dead
Off in the red, dance, dance with the dead

Oh, aw man, I can't believe this is happening (ah ah)
Oh, aw man, I can't believe this is happening (ah ah)
Oh, aw man, I can't believe this is happening (ah ah)
Oh, aw man, I can't believe...

But I'm aware, and I don't care
And I'm aware, yeah
But I'm aware, and I don't care
And I'm aware, yeah, yeah---
