Its Everybodys Game
And Everybody Plays
Why dont you come along?
Its such a beautiful day
And were gonna need a ball
And were gonna need some bases
Swinging for the fences
Look at all the happy faces

And Ill throw it to you
You throw it to me
Lets invite the kid 
who lives down the street
Calling Dave
And Smitty Too

How about you?
Call all our friends
How about you?
Call all our friends
How about you?
Call all our friends
How about you?
Call all our friends

Its everybodys game 
(Its everybodys game)
And everybody plays
(And everybody plays)
Why dont you come along?
(Why dont you come along)
Its such a beautiful day
(Its such a beautiful day)

Gonna need our dolls
And were gonna need a tea set 
(Tea set)
Everybodys getting dressed up
(Dressed up)
I said Are you having fun yet?

Ill pour the tea
You cut the cake
Its make-believe
But it sure tastes great
Having fun
At tea party too

How about you?
Call all our friends
How about you?
Call all our friends
How about you?
Call all our friends
How about you?
Just call all our friends

Call them up
To come on down
Tell all your friends 
To gather around
To play some games
To share some toys
How about some music
Gonna make some noise

Call all our friends
To get in the game
Meet someone new
Learn somebodys name
Is everyone here?
Theres so much to do

Its everybodys game
And everybody plays
Why dont you come along?
Its such a beautiful day

Its everybodys game
Call all our friends
How about you? (And everybody plays) 
Call all our friends
How about you? (Why dont you come along?)
Call all our friends
How about you? (Its such a beautiful day)
Call all our friends
How about you? (Its everybodys game)
Call all our friends
How about you? (Why dont you come along?)
Call all our friends
How about you? (Its such a beautiful day)
Call all our friends
How about you?
Call our friends now
How about you?---Lyrics submitted by Jennine Edwards.
