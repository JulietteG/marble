i never really made it to the human
that you wanted me to be
the glamor parade
night after night wasnt me

i would rather be alone with aliens and rainbows
on the other side of the universe
and finally this is me
this is my coup de grace, my reality

you're only gonna hear em if we listen
but you keep talking all the time
and the radio and the television
static confusion in my mind

i would rather be alone with aliens and rainbows
on the other side of the universe
and finally this is me
this is my coup de grace, my reality 

a star is only glitter
when it shatters in the night
and it all becomes nothing
becomes nothing

aliens and rainbows somewhere on the other side of the universe
and finally this is me
this is my coup de grace, this is my reality

this is my ending, pretending
i would rather be alone
with aliens and rainbows---Lyrics submitted by leo305.
