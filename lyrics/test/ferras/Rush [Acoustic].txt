I kissed your sweet lips 
I floated so high
Your eyes looked at mine
The world froze in time
What is this feeling?
I am on cloud 9 
I guess I'm still reeling
From your body next to mine

It's a rush i can't explain
Like you shot something crazy into my veins
And i'm ten feet off the ground
And i don't wanna come down
Don't wanna come down

I know you're sleeping
I wish you were right here
Cause my bed's so empty
I'd hold you so close dear
And i sang my song to you
Your smile was priceless
What else can i do?
I'm a junkie over you

It's a rush i can't explain
Like you shot something crazy into my veins
And i'm ten feet off the ground
And i don't wanna come down
Don't wanna come down

Cause is it me or is everything spinning
I'm wide awake, but i must be dreaming
It'd like your some kind of drug
I try to catch my breath
See if i'm still breathing
Touch my heart, make sure it's still beating
It's like i've falllen in love

It's a rush i can't explain
Like you shot something crazy into my veins
And i'm ten feet off the ground
And i don't wanna come down
Don't wanna come down---Lyrics submitted by rae.
