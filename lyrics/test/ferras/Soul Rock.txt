So if your gonna leave me i got a few words to say
Im travelin the mornin but you knew that anyway
And truth is your the reason that i wake up each day
And i dont need anybody else to tell me

You are my soul rock when the tide is up and the waves are crashin in on me
Soul rock when ive had enough of the reck of everything
These streets got another toe and the city is sinkin
Ooo your the only hope i hold on to
When im drownin

This is for the damage and the maddness that i made
I know i can be thoughtless but i promis that i'll change
My heart may be bullet proof but its still gonna break
Dont say theres anybody else to tell me (tell me) 
C'mon tell me!

You are my soul rock when the tide is up and the waves are crashin in on me
Soul rock when ive had enough of the reck of everything
These streets got another toe and the city is sinkin 
Oooo your the only hope i hold on to
When im drownin

You are my soul rock when the tide is up and the waves are crashin in on me
Soul rock when ive had enough of the reck of everything
These streets got another toe and the city is sinkin (city is sinkin)
Ooo your the only hope i hold on to (i dont need anybody else though)
You your the only hope i hold on to (i dont need anybody else though)
Ooo your the only hope i hold on to when im drownin---Lyrics submitted by shannon.
