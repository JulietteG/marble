(Chorus)
Sayin' i love you it's the hardest thing to do
and if I ever do, girl i'll always be true
I may not be the best, lookin' guy you ever knew
But I can show you love that will always true
And when your skies turn gray, my love will guide the way
And if this words that I hold could only be told
(Repeat Chorus)
And when your tears fall to the ground
I will pick you up when you're feeling down
woooohhhh
(Repeat  Chorus)
