I smoke so much marijuana 
I mix it with the Grinder
But nothing compares to this purple skunk from Orange Hill
Jah know I love this kiki 
Got-got no kiki sweep me
But nothing compares to this purple skunk from Orange Hill

(The purple) Haffi burn round inna circle
(The purple) Make yuh move slow like a turtle
(The purple) Stink up my house and my car, too
(The purple) Make when yuh a talk yuh nuh certain
(The purple) Fat up my eye like Urkel
(The purple) Come from the style that fir to
(The purple) Make you want greet all the girl to
(The purple) Make you feel the rule of the world, too...

Send fi weed then the weed man come
With a ten pound in a jamb
