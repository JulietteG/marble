I let you in, just a little too close
You shut the door, so nobody would know
I know I heard a shot, on the fourteenth floor
The music was raw, you really put on a show

[Chorus]
This is where we are
This is where we've been
This is how I fall
In love with you again

I had to say goodbye, before I said hello
I saw you crash, and you took off your clothes

And this is the sound of a broken heart beating
Almost died when I found your heart cheating
I won't survive very much longer
You got to keep this broken heart stronger

[Chorus]

Where did I go wrong
I can't be your friend
After where we've been
I can't see your face again

You leave your troubles at the door
I feel we don't know what we're fighting for
Feels like I'm a prisoner baby
So hard when you have to fake it
It hurts so much to feel love
When you know you've got to break it

And this is the sound of a broken heart beating
Almost died when I found your heart cheating
I won't survive very much longer
You got to keep this broken heart stronger

[Chorus]

And this is the sound of a broken heart beating
(where did I go wrong)
Almost died when I found your heart cheating
(I can't be your friend)
I won't survive very much longer
(after where we've been)
You got to keep this broken heart stronger
(I can't see your face again)

I fall for you again
(I fall for you again)
I fall for you again
(I fall for you again)
I fall for you again
Whoah

[Chorus]
