Cant' stay at home, can't stay at school,
old folks say you poor little fool.
Down the street i'm the girl next door,
i'm the fox you've been waiting for. 

Hello daddy, hello mom,
i'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb.
Hello world i'm your wild girl,
i'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb.

Stone age love and strange sounds too,
common baby let me get to you.
Bad nights causin' teenage blues,
get down ladies you've got nothin' to loose.

Hello daddy, hello mom,
i'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb.
Hello world im your wild girl, 
i'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb.

Hello daddy, hello mom
i'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb.
Hello world i'm your wild girl,
i'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb.

Hey street boy, you want some style?
Your dead end dreams gonna make you smile.
I'll give you somthin' to live for,
have you, grab you, till' your sore.

Hello daddy, hello mom,
i'm you'r ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb.
Hello world, i'm your willd girl
i'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch- cherry bomb,
cherry bomb,
cherry bomb,
cherry bomb,
cherry bomb,
cherry bomb.---Lyrics submitted by Sofia.
