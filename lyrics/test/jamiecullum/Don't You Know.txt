Well, don't you know, baby
Well, don't you know baby
Now don't you know baby
Little girl, little girl, don't you know
Please listen to me baby
Girl, I'm in love with you so

Now turn your lamp down low
I said turn your lamp down low
Wooo, turn your lamp down low
And turn your lamp down low
Come on baby
Girl I'm in love with you so

Now I know I've been away
For such a long time
But now baby
I can't get you off of my mind
So come on now baby,
Come on, come on now baby
Listen to me baby
Love your daddy all night long

Now if you love me
Like I love you
We can do all the things that we
Used to do
So come on, come on, come on now baby
Now baby come on
Love your daddy all night long

Have you heard baby
I'm back in town
Let's mess around
See what he's puttin down
Come on now baby
Come on, come on now, child
Come on, come on now, baby
Love your daddy all night long

So turn your lamp down low
Cause I love you so
Baby, baby please come on
Baby, baby please come on
Now you give me talking with me, baby
Love your daddy all night long---
