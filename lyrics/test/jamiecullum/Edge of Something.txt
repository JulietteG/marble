I've got some ways of forgetting now
What you're finding out what you're finding out
I've got some ways of believing now
What you're leaving out what you're leaving out
So take a reach down inside your soul
What you gonna find what you gonna find
And it's so deep down inside your soul
What you leave behind what you leave behind
I can hear it calling
Can't you tell?

I'm on the edge of something
So I just keep running every time
I lose my head
I'm on the edge of something
So I just keep falling every time
I lose my head

Are there some secrets embedded down
In the frozen ground in the frozen ground
Under a cold moon and a fractured sky
There's a universe there behind those eyes
You're gonna make good on promises
That you know you could
That you know you could
Cos no one here worships suddenness
Though you wish they would though you wish they would

I can hear it calling - Can't you tell?

I'm on the edge of something
So I just keep running every time
I lose my head
I'm on the edge of something
So I just keep falling every time
I lose my head

I don't need a vision
I'm just waiting on collisions of the brain and the heart
I'm patient for decisions
and some stormy revelations I can claim from the start
I'm kicking up a storm
In the valley I was born
I can hear the tower ring
Out here on the edge of something

I'm on the edge of something
So I just keep running every time
I lose my head
I'm on the edge of something
So I just keep falling every time
I lose my head---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
