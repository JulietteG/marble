It's so important to make someone happy.
Make just one someone happy.
Make just one heart to heart you, you sing to

One smile that cheers you.
One face that lights when it nears you.
One girl your - your everything to

Fame, if you win it,
Comes and goes in a minutes
Where's the real stuff in life, to cling to?

Love is the answer.
Someone to love is the answer.
Once you've found her,
Build your world around her.

Make someone happy.
Make just one someone happy.
And you will be happy too.---
