(feat. Gregory Porter)

Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Understand me, understand me...

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems again that all I have do is worry
Then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you
Oh, Oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
Some little foolish thing some simple thing I've done

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Understand me, understand me...

Understand me...
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood---
