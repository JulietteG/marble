(V1) 2 in the morning, police knockin' at my door
What for? Never know the reasons they be coming packin'
And then they're coming through the I tell them " He just kick down 
My door" 
Even though I'm on the floor with a gun to my head.

All the reason I be holdin all the trees
And I gotta a lot a weed
They be spottin' me with infa-red
In the mood I say, " who the hell is you?"
Still they comin through holdin up the innocent

(V2) 3 in the mornin in the cell you'll get harrassed by the man
Call my girl, baby coming just as quick as she can
With the money and the 'case' we gonna make it alright
Even though my weed and moneycan't afford it tonight.

And leave the 'case' to detonate inside the place while I'm gone, 
Tellin all the places, yo, I ought to handle all this alone
I say somethin' wrong? wait, who the hell is you? 
Aw you coming through, holdin' up the innocent.

(V3) 4 in the mornin, police knockin' at my door, what for? 
Bet I know the reason they be comin' back and
Then they comin through, I tell them " He just kicked down my door"
Even though I'm on the floor with a gun to my head

All the reason I be holdin the trees
I gotta lot a weed
They be spottin' me with infa-red
And I'm in the mood saying " who the hell is you"
Oh you comin' through, holdin' up the innocent.---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
