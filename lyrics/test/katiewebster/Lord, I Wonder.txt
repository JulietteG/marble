Lord, I wonder
How much longer
Will I have to sing the Blues

Yes, I wonder
How much longer
Will I have to sing the Blues

Now my mother, went on before me
Sing the Gospel all her life
Then my father, went on right after her
Preach the Gospel till he died

So, I wonder
How much longer
Will I have to sing the Blues

Yes, I wonder
How much longer
Will I have to sing the Blues

Muddy Waters
Jimmy Reed
Lightning Hopkins

B.B. King

Ohh!, cause the Blues has been good to me
And I guess after sangn all of my life
I sang the Blues and play some Boogie-Woogie too

Oh Yeah!

So, I wonder
How much longer
Will I have to sing the Blues

Yes, I wonder
How much longer
Will I have to sing the Blues

-Piano Solo-

So, I wonder
How much longer
Will I have to sing the Blues

Yes, I wonder
How much longer
Will I have to sing the Blues

Bessy Smith
