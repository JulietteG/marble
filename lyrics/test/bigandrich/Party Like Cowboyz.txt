Discount box wine
Burning like turpentine
Anything to get us buzzed
We got six strings, G strings
Pawn shop bling bling
Raisin hell just because
Even old grannies getting chatty and batty
On pappys apple pie moonshine
I dont know what youre expecting but buddy if youre bettin
Id be bettin on a hell of a time

Chorus: Cause you know were gonna party like cowboyz
Whoop out the big toys
Pour on the gasoline
Put some fire on the fuses
Were bout to do this
Pumped on adrenaline
Were getting jackety jacked up, beer backed and doubled up
Stand up and make some noise
Were gonna party like cowboyz

Some girls are gettin flirty and some are dancing dirty
The country girls are coming alive
Some guys are rocking and some dudes are socking
And gonna have to take it outside
Two for ones are going, the pyro is blowing
The whole place is coming unwound
The roof is a raisin, the whole place is shakin
And were just getting started now

Repeat Chorus

Feeling kinda Tonto riding on a pinto
Screaming cross the wide open range
Got fire for a saddle
Make the red dirt rattle
Cause Im riding on a trail of flames and shes a beautiful thing
She goes so fast, kick a jet planes ass
And dang I love them footloosin ways
Like a bull in a cage, make a cowboy rage
If I ever get to ride that hottie with a brain

Getting jackety jacked up, beer backed and doubled up
Stand up and make some noise
Gonna party like cowboyz
Yeah were gonna whoop out the big toys
Pour on the gasoline (gonna party like cowboyz)
Put some fire on the fuses
Were bout to do this
Pumped on adrenaline (gonna party like cowboyz)
Getting jackety jacked up, beer backed and doubled up
Come on and make some noise (gonna party like cowboyz)
Were gonna party like cowboyz (Im a cowboy baby)
Im a cowboy---
