Sitting on a bus holding her cross, wondering deep inside
rolling through a field with some alamo steel looking for a place to hide
Shes heading out west but she cant confess and shes hoping that she can find
a way to explain the cause of her pain and the shame that she left behind
Hoping someday shell learn to behave so that people dont wonder just whats gotten under her skin

The satellite eyes of the runaway bride is all that is on TV
Shes counting the miles to forget for a while but she wont take the test to see
The desert goes by with its elegant sky reaching for a silhouette peak
Shes got tears in her eyes but before the ink dries shes hoping that she can speak
Hoping someday shell learn to explain so that people dont wonder just whats gotten under her skin

Whats it about, youre not ready yet?
If its in doubt, how far you gonna get?
Your ticket to ride has got you on the run
Ready or not your futures gonna come

Whats it about, youre not ready yet?
If its in doubt, how far you gonna get?
Your ticket to ride has got you on the run
Ready or not your futures gonna come

Sitting on a bus holding her cross wondering deep inside
rolling through a field with some alamo steel looking for a place to hide
Shes heading out west but she cant confess and shes hoping that she can find
a way to explain the cause of her pain and the shame that she left behind
hoping someday shell learn to explain so that people dont wonder just whats gotten under her skin---Lyrics submitted by Delia.
