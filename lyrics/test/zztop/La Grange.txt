Rumour sprendin around in that Texas town
about that shack outside La Grange
you know what I'm talkin' about.
Just let me know if you wanna go
to that home out on the range.
They have lotta nice girls.
ra
Have mercy.

A haw, haw, haw, haw, a haw.
A haw, haw, haw.
Well, I hear it's fine if you got the time
and the ten to get yourself in.
A hmm, hmm.

And I hear it's tight most ev'ry night,
but now I might be mistaken.
hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

Have mercy.---Lyrics submitted by Carlos.
