Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Fly so high and feel no pain

All ye maidnes hede my warning
Never trust the heart of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
THey they'll leave ou for another
Break your little heart in two

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Percious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Fly so high and feel no pain

If I was a little sparrow 
O'er thses mountains I would fly
I would find him, I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
I would ask him, I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain

I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme

Little sparrow...ahhhh....ohhh

All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the heart of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend

Oh the sorrow never end---Lyrics submitted by jsli.
