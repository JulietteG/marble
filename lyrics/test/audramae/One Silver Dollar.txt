One silver dollar 
Bright Silver dollar
Changing hands
Changing hands

Endlessly rolling
Wasted and stolen
Changing hands
Changing hands

Spent for a beer he's drinking 
Won by a gambler's lust
Pierced by an outlaw's bullet
And lost in the blood red dust

One silver dollar 
Bright Silver dollar
Changing hands
Changing hands

Love is a shining dollar
Bright as a church bell's chime
Gambled and spent, and wasted
And lost in a dart of time

Ooooh...

One silver dollar 
Bright Silver dollar
Changing lives
Changing hearts
Changing hands---Lyrics submitted by jsli.
