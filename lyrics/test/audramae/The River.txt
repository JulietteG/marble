I've done a bad thing it's okay
I'm going down to the river today
And the river's gonna wash my sins away
Till I'm born again tomorrow
Oh to get over my head
Make me forget my sorrow

I'm going down to the river alone
Don't tell mama and daddy I'm gone
And if they cry when I don't come home
Just lie and tell them I'm funnin'
Whoa to get out of my eyes
Into the river wide I'm runiing

And I can't swim
But it's alright
'Cause all my sin will drag me down even if I could
And if it weren't for him and the love that hight
I'd be living for the light like a good girl should
'Cause a good girl should

This old town'll have my skin
I can't speak the trouble I'm in
So if I don't come back again
Go lie beneath the willow
'Cause where I carved my name
Is where my soul will remain
And I'll still know

Lord, and I can't swim
But it's alright
'Cause all my sin will drag me down even if I could
And if it weren't for him and the love that hight
I'd be living for the light like a good girl should
'Cause a good girl should

When I meet the Lord so kind
I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind
And I'll tell him I wanna know why oh why,
When he's so damned forgivin'
my daddy won't look in my eyes
Momma knows the lies I'm living

Oh I can't swim
But it's alirght
'Cause all my sin will drag me down even if I could
And if it weren't for him and the love that hight
I'd be living for the light like a good girl should
'Cause a good girl should

....as a good girl should---Lyrics submitted by jsli.
