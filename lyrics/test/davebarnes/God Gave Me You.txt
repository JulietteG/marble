Ive been a walking heartache
Ive made a mess of me
The person that Ive been lately
Aint who I wanna be

But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

God gave me you
For the ups and downs
God gave me you
For the days of doubt
For when I think Ive lost my way
There are no words here left to say
Its true
God gave me you

Theres more here than what were seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me

Youll always be loves great martyr 
And Ill be the flattered fool
And I need you

God gave me you
For the ups and downs
God gave me you
For the days of doubt
For when I think Ive lost my way
There are no words here left to say
Its true
God gave me you

On my own Im only
Half of what I could be like
Cant do without you

We are stitched together
What love has tattered out
Pray we never undo

God gave me you
For the ups and downs
God gave me you
For the days of doubt
God gave me you
For the ups and downs
God gave me you 
For the days of doubt

For when I think Ive lost my way
There are no words here left to say
Its true
God gave me you
Gave me you
Gave me you---Lyrics submitted by Moriah.
