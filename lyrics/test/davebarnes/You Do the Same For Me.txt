Tell me everything
Cause I can see it in your eyes
Theres a story there
These tears wont tell me why

Oh and dont be strong
Isnt that what got you here
Wandering in this dark alone
Among your fears

Let me know what I can do
To bear this weight here with you

You do the same for me
Oh you do the same
Youre the blood when my heart wont beat
Oh you do the same
So Ill hold the light in this night
So your eyes can see
You do the same for me

This circumstance
It is such a common thing
Were all butterflies
With broken wings

Let me know what I can do
To bear this weight here with you

You do the same for me
Oh you do the same
Youre the blood when my heart wont beat
Oh you do the same
So Ill hold the light in this night
So your eyes can see
You do the same for me

Love will never leave us alone
So Ill never leave you alone

You do the same for me
Oh you do the same
Youre the blood when my heart wont beat
Oh you do the same
And Ill hold the light in this night
So your eyes can see
You do the same for me

You do the same, the same, for me---Lyrics submitted by Morgan.
