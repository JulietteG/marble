Let's just take our time
There's nothing else to do
What better way to spend the night than wasting it with you

The moon has won the war
The daylight waits to end
Stay here by my side
We'll watch the struggle start again

I need you now and forever so stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept from me like a secret
And I swore that I was through until you
Until you

The city settles down
I watch you as you sleep
There's a silent celebration for every breath you breathe

Now this all makes sense
With you as company I left all I knew and found a better part of me
Yeah
Yeah

I need you now and forever so stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept from me like a secret
And I swore that I was through until you
Until you

The time it took to find you
I would wait again my baby
The feelings that I feel with you now
Yeah
Yeah

I need you now and forever so stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept from me like a secret
And I swore that I was through until you
Until you
Until you
Until you---Lyrics submitted by Edgar.
