Grow a Pear
Last night I had enough of you
I put down the bricks
And I could tell you took it hard it was over your face
Since youre slippin and flippin
But here is the sitch
I signed up for a membership
You are just a bitch

You should know
That I love you alone
But I just cant date a dude with a vag

When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking bout you nonstop
That you cried bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Yeah I think youre hot
I think youre alright
But youre acting like the chick all the time
You are cool and now youre not just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

When I first met you
Panties droppin
Every time I saw you it was on and
One day you asked if we can just talkin
Thats the reason why Im walkin
If I am honest Im just not hooked on your phonics
Im not tryin to be rude or crude
I just want one thing from you
And you got confused

You should know
That I love you alone
But I just cant date a dude with a vag

When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking bout you nonstop
That you cried bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Yeah I think youre hot
I think youre alright
But youre acting like the chick all the time
You are cool and now youre not just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
Grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
Grow a pear
You can call me back
And no I dont want your man-gina
When you grow a pear
You can call me back


When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking bout you nonstop
That you cried bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Yeah I think youre hot
I think youre alright
But youre acting like the chick all the time
You are cool and now youre not just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
