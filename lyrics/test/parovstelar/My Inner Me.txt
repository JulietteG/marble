I just work out.
It's been so loud to fall.
No more words, just tranquility.

Walkin along the Danube, 
Sweet smell is in the air.
The sun burns my skin,
I look for the tube.
It feels like going nowhere.

Emptiness and silence make me happy
.... and silence make me happy.

More or less I'm satisfied and feel my inner me.

Emptiness and silence make me happy.

More or less I just don't mind.
I am where I wanna be.

Emptiness and silence make me happy.

She loves a man and he loves her too, 
but they don't know how to get along.
I just remember that smile.
The smell is on my skin.
Feeling you, feel the sunlight.
I know I cannot win.

Feeling you...
I know I cannot win.---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
