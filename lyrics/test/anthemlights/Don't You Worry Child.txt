Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
Heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now

There was a time
I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home
I was a king, I had a gold throne
Those days are gone
Now the memory's on the wall
I hear the songs
From the places where I was born

Upon the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!

"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."

There was a time
I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world
I thought I'd never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend

Upon the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!

"Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now."
Yeah!

You are love
No mistake
You are perfectly made
(x6)

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
See heaven's got a plan for you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
