Hello, my name is regret
I'm pretty sure we have met
Every single day of your life
I'm the whisper inside
That wont let you forget

Hello, my name is defeat
(This is amazing grace)
I know you recognize me
(This is unfailing love)
Just when you think you can win
I'll drag you right back down again
And when youve lost all belief 

You laid down Your life
(Child of the one true King)
That I would be set free
Change, I have been set free
Amazing grace, is the song I sing
(All that You've done for me)

Staring at a stop sign
Watching people drive by
T Mac on the radio
Got so much on your mind
Nothing's really going right
Looking for a ray of hope

You're an overcomer
Stay in the fight til the final round
You're not going under
Cause God is holding you right now
You might be down for a moment
Feeling like it's hopeless
That's when He reminds You
You're an overcomer
You're an overcomer

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, just that Name
Jesus
(Hello, my name is)
Jesus
(This is amazing grace)
Jesus
(Makes me an overcomer)

When I wake up in the Land of Glory
And with the saints I will tell my story
There will be one Name that I proclaim

(Hello, my name is)
When I wake up in the land of Glory
(This is amazing grace)
And with the saints I will tell my story
(You're an overcomer)
There will be one name that I proclaim

Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
Every hour I need You
My one defense, my righteousness
Oh God, how I need You

Oh God, how I need you---
