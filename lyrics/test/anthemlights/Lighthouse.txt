Like ships bound for shipwreck,
Most people just simply drift along,
And miss their destination
Without knowing anything is wrong.

No direction and without a care,
Feels so good and then you're lost out there.
Don't you remember how it felt 'til someone showed you the way?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[Chorus]
It's up to you,
It's up to me,
To be the lighthouse,
They should know they're not alone,
So shine,
So they can see,
The lighthouse,
And find their way back home.

Tragically,
We've forgotten the reason we're even here at all,
Worse still, we remember it's just that we feel so comfortable.

Do we notice,
Do we even care,
All the people that are lost out there?
Don't you remember how it felt 'til someone showed you the way.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[Chorus]

So climb to the highest point,
Scream in your loudest voice,
There's a lifeline waiting for you.
Strike up the brightest fire,
Fan the flames and let it burn.
Just let it burn,
The world is waiting.

[Chorus x2]---Lyrics submitted by Kitani Rose.
