Never put your love out on the line
Never say yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what you want
Someone used to feel like your not enough

dont have to care
So play em like a Ken doll
Wont wash your hair
Just em bounce like basketball

But I, wanna make you like a girl
Paint your nails and wear high heels
Yes, I want to treat you right
Just give me your hand

Ill make me glow, but you cover up
Wont let it show
you keep puttin your defences up
like you dont wanna fall in love
If you ever did that
You think youd have a heart attack
You think youd have a heart attack
You think youd have a heart attack

I never break a sweat for the other girls
Then you come around, and changed my world
All you have to do is be your self
Its always alright just let me help

Its just not fair
I hate to see you when your hurting
I gasp for air
together well be worth it

But I, wanna make you like a girl
Paint your nails and wear perfume
Yes, I want to treat you right girl
Just give me your hand

Ill make me glow, but you cover up
Wont let it show
you keep puttin your defences up
like you dont wanna fall in love
If you ever did that
You think youd have a heart attack
You think youd have a heart attack
You think youd have a heart attack

The feelings are lost in your lungs
Theyre burning, youd rather be numb
O yes Im the one to blame
So scared you take off in a run
Im flying too close to the sun
And you burst into flames

Ill make me glow, but you cover up
Wont let it show

Ill make me glow, but you cover up
Wont let it show
you keep puttin your defences up
like you dont wanna fall in love
If you ever did that
You think youd have a heart attack
You think youd have a heart attack
You think youd have a heart attack---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
