Fate, how could it be
that all I'm afraid of 
are three simple words
Fallen, oh, I have fallen
Something so good
is something so wrong

Chorus:
Baby, it ain't so easy to see
I have found someone to love
And baby, it ain't so easy to trust 
a love that could hurt me so much

Yesterday, love knocked me down
Troubles a comin', comin' to stay
but I, I'd rather leave knowin', 
knowin' we'd try
than not try at all

Chorus:
Baby, it ain't so easy to see
I have found someone to love
And baby, it ain't so easy to trust 
a love that could hurt me so much

oh...

Oh no, I've gotta be strong
when it comes down to faith
and a deeper devotion
And oh no, it won't be that long
til you turn my world 
right into motion

Chorus:
Baby, it ain't so easy to see
I have found someone to love
And baby, it ain't so easy to trust 
a love that could hurt me so much

oh...---Lyrics submitted by Melissa Tennis.
