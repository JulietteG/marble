Verse 1:
When I think of how He Came so far from Glory.
Came and dwelt among the lowly such as I,
To suffer shame and such disgrace, on Mount Calv'ry take my place,
It's then I ask myself this question:  Who Am I?

Chorus:
Who am I that a King would bleed and die for?
Who am I that He would pray, "Not my will thine" for?
The answer I may never know
Why He ever loved me so,
That to an old rugged cross He'd go,
For Who am I?

Verse 2:
When I'm reminded oif His words, "I'll leave thee never,
Just be true, I'll give to you a life forever,"
I wonder what I could have done to deserve God's only Son,
To Fight my battles 'til they're won; Who am I?

Chorus:
Who am I that a King would bleed and die for?
Who am I that He would pray, "Not my will thine" for?
The answer I may never know
Why He ever loved me so,
That to an old rugged cross He'd go,
For Who am I?---Lyrics submitted by Sherida.
