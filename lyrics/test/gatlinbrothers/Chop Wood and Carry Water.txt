One night i had a dream ,
That I climbed up to the mountaintop,
That reaches all the way,
To heaven above

And I had a conversation,
With old man in a white robe,
I asked a simple question,
How do I show love?

And I asked him what to do,
When I climbed down off of that mountaintop,
That reaches all the way,
To heaven above

His answer was so simple,
That it took me by surprise,
He said wayfarin' pilgrim,
If you want to show love

Chop wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry water,
(Just a little water)
Build a fire and give a drink to all of God's sons and daughters,
If you wanna save a strugglin' soul from stumblin' to the slaughter,
Chop Wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry water,
(Just a little water)
Chop Wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry Water

But I did not like the answer,
From the old man on the mountaintop,
That reaches all the way,
To heaven above

Cos I wanted to do it bigger,
And I wanted to do it better,
So I forgot about what he told me,
When he said to show love

Chop wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry water,
(Just a little water)
Build a fire and give a drink to all of God's sons and daughters,
If you wanna save a strugglin' soul from stumblin' to the slaughter,
Chop Wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry water,
(Just a little water)
Chop Wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry Water

One night I saw a beggar man on the streets of New Orleans,
And I swear I heard a voice that came from heaven above,
It said this is one of my children,
And my child is cold and hungry,
Now this is your big chance if you want to show love,

So I wrapped my arms around him,
And he turned his face up to me,
And I swear it was the old man from heaven above,
He said wayfarin' pilgrim,
You know I've been lookin' for you,
You finally got it figured out just how to show love

Chop wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry water,
(Just a little water)
Build a fire and give a drink to all of God's sons and daughters,
If you wanna save a strugglin' soul from stumblin' to the slaughter,
Chop Wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry water,
(Just a little water)
Chop Wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry Water

Chop wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry water,
(Just a little water)
Build a fire and give a drink to all of God's sons and daughters,
If you wanna save a strugglin' soul from stumblin' to the slaughter,
Chop Wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry water,
(Just a little water)
Chop Wood,
(Chop wood)
And carry Water ---
