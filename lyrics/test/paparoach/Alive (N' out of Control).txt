Go!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

For crying out loud, I'm running from a comedown
God forbid, I know I've been a letdown
Reaching for the sky while laying in a gutter
Kicking and screaming, I am singing bloody murder
(I am screaming bloody murder)
(I am screaming bloody murder)

Well, I'm alive when I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control, I'm losing my soul
I'm alive when I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control, I'm losing my soul

I can't be your angel, while I'm living like a devil
Can't be your lover, while I'm living like a rebel
Don't want your pity and I don't want your help
Don't try and save me, go take care of yourself
(Go take care of yourself)
(You go take care of yourself)

Well, I'm alive when I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control, I'm losing my soul
I'm alive when I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control, I'm losing my soul

(I'm alive!) I'm sick of the pain, I'm sick of the sorrow
Sick of today, I'm sick of tomorrow
I'm addicted to the misery in my head
I better stop before I end up dead

So I climb to the top just to fall to the bottom
And I climb to the top just to fall to the bottom

Go!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

Well, I'm alive when I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control, I'm losing my soul
I'm alive when I'm vulnerable
I'm out of control, I'm losing my soul

I can't be your angel, while I'm living like a devil
Can't your lover, while I'm living like a rebel
Don't want be your pity and I don't want your help
Don't try and save me, go take care of yourself---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
