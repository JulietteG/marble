When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
Then I realize that
She could see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head
This situation leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will it be an amputation?

I don't know,
If I care
I'm the jerk,
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not, loves me not
Do you realize, I won't compromise
She loves me not, loves me not

Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away 
And untill this day 
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say sometimes
She says she loves me not
But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over

I don't know 
If I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not, loves me not
Do you realize, I won't compromise
She loves me not
Life's not fair
I'm the jerk

Line for line, rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we'll be fighting all the god damn time
Its makin me sick
Relationship is gettin ill
Piss drunk stupid
Mad
On the real, could you feel
What I feel, whats the deal girl
Tearin up each others world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is a promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldnt be this way
I think we should work this out
It's alright baby, we can scream and shout.

I don't know 
If I care
I'm the jerk
Life's not fair
Fighting all the time
This is out of line
She loves me not, loves me not
Do you realize I won't compromise
She loves me not, loves me not
Lifes not fair
Lifes not fair
Lifes not fair
Im the jerk
Lifes not fair
She loves me not
Loves me not---Lyrics submitted by Sam.
