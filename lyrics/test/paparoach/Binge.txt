You better put that down
You better put that down 

All I need is a bottle, and I don't need no friends, no
Wallow in my pain, I swallow as I pretend
To act like I'm happy, when I drink till no end, no

I'm losing all my friends, I'm losing in the end
She says:

Behave, little boy, you better sit back down
Till you hold your ground
It's your time to learn to fight
You better sit back down, till you hold your ground

When I'm sober, life bores me, so I get drunk again
I'm losing all my friends, I'm losing in the end
She says:

Behave, little boy, you better sit back down
Till you hold your ground
It's your time to learn to fight
You better sit back down, till you hold your ground, yeah

You better sit back down
You better put that down
Put the bottle down, I am on a binge 

Behave, little boy, you better sit back down
Till you hold your ground
It's your time to learn to fight
You better sit back down, till you hold your ground, yeah

I am on a binge, I wish things would change
Wish they'd rearrange, Im on a binge

I wish things would change, Wish they'd rearrange,
I am on a binge, Im on a binge, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Colin.
