We live in a cold dark world with venom in it's fangs.
You can spit it in my face but I know I'll be ok

It's on the attack. It's a war, It's a game.
A ball and chain chew my arm off to get away

Don't fight, or it deny it, invite it cause when it ..
Feels like a kick in the teeth, I can take it.
Throw your stones and you won't see me break it.
Say what you want, take your shots.
You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth
(Na na na na na)
Kick in the Teeth (na na na na na na)

I gotta say thanks cause you kick me when im down
I'm bleeding out the mouth.
I hope you know I'm stronger now.

I'm taking the hate, I'm turning it all around.
I wont go down 'til I'm six feet underground.

Dont fight, or it deny it, invite it, cause when it ...
Feels like a kick in the teeth, I can take it.
Throw your stones and you won't see me break it.
Say what you want, take your shots.
You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth
(na na na na na )
Kick in the teeth (na na na na na)
Kick in the Teeth 

What doesnt kill me only, will make me stronger in my head
In my head
(guitar solo)
Cause when it
Feels like a kick in the teeth, I can take it.
Throw your stones and you won't see me break it.
Say what you want, take your shots
You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth
(na na na na na )
Kick in the teeth
(na na na na na)

Say what you want. Take your shots.
You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth.
(na na na na na)
Kick in the teeth (na na na na na)
Kick in the teeth (na na na na na)
Kick in the teeth (na na na na na)---Lyrics submitted by Lacey.
