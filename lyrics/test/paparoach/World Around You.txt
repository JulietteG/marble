Somebody falls in love, somebody breaks a heart
We never fell in love, we only fell apart
I'm getting lonely, I need somebody to hold me
I thought I'd never miss her
She cut me out of her pictures

Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the desperation?
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the life your living?

Somebody tells the truth, somebody lives a lie
I can see right through, the story is in your eyes
I know what they're saying, there is no need for explaining
There will be nothing better
Than when I burn all your letters

Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the desperation?
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the life your living? 

Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the desperation?
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the life your living? 

We never fell in love, we only fell apart 
We only fell apart 
We only fell apart 
We only fell apart 

So we pick up the pieces and put 'em together
We said this was gonna last forever 
Pick up the pieces and put 'em together
We said this was gonna last forever 

Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the desperation?
Take a look at the world around you
Can you see the life your living? 

We never fell in love, we only fell apart 
We never fell in love, we only fell apart 

Somebody falls in love, somebody breaks a heart
We never fell in love, we only fell apart
Somebody falls in love, somebody breaks a heart
We never fell in love, we only fell apart---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
