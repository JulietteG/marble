my name's Moby dick
mister dick if your nasty
rock a mic
with a voice that's raspy
an' i'm poetic in my operation
my god given talent is to rock all the nations

We're going to infest!
infest the theory of my first manifesto
push your wig back
with my lyrical pistol
blow now papa roach is on your mantel
bangin' like your head

piece it's just that simple
cock back and unleash with my physical
wrap you in my thoughts
and become indivisible
centrifugal forces individual
into my mind as we rock into ritual

you better do just what i say
and if you don't then you will pay....INFEST!
we're going to infest
we're getting in your head
what is wrong with the world today
the government, the media, or your family

we're going to infest
we're getting in your head
what is wrong with the world today
the government, the media, or your family
you will do just what i say

now that i got your attention
did i forget to mention
all the heads we've been infesting
hope y'all people learn your lessons
cus' the game of life is crazy
got all the people guessin'

what is wrong with the world today
government, media, or your family
would you cry if i died today
i think it'd be better if you did not say

you will do just what i say
and if you don't then you will pay.....INFEST!
we're going to infest
we're getting in your head
what is wrong with the world today
the government, the media, or your family

we, will, infest
die, like ,the rest
first they shackle your feet
then they stand you in a line
then they beat you like meat
then they grab you by your mind

first they shackle your feet
then they stand you in a line
then they beat you like meat
infest your mind

we, will, infest
die, like, the rest
people are the problem today
we will infest
die like the rest
people are the problem today!!!!

we're going to infest
we're getting in your head
what is wring with the world today
the government, the media, or your family

we're going to infest
we're getting in your head
what is wrong with the world today
the government, the media, or your family!!!!!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Brock.
