I never pick up
I never wanted you to know
I was running out of love
You didn't walk out, you didn't give up on me
So even if you're coming out
I'm not giving up on you

We never have to say goodbye
Cause I can feel you from the afterlife
And I just wanna say,that every single day
You make me take a deeper look inside
If everything you say its true
Then I would never have to call on you
In every single way
You're ripping every day
So we never have to say
We never have to say goodbye

We never have to say
We never have to say goodbye---
