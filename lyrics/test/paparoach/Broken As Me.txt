You're just as broken as me

Shut your mouth, cause I can see through the lies
We're only getting sicker
From the secrets we hide

Disaster is our master as
We lay here burning in bed
But something tells me
I cannot give up on you yet

I will not give up on you today

I will forgive and forget
Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left its the emptiness inside of me
You murder my heart
Broke my trust and watch me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me

You're just as broken as me

You always play the victim
And you just cant decide
If the vicious way we love each other
Fucked up our lives

When we standing in the aftermath
Our emptiness is what's left
And if you really loved me
Will you love me to death?

I will love until the end

I will forgive and forget
Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left its the emptiness inside of me
You murder my heart
Broke my trust and watch me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me

Just as broken as
You're just as broken as me

I've been a slave
You've been a slave
I've been a slave to the
Hatred in you, in me
I see
You're just as broken as me

I will forgive and forget
Cause I know that it will set me free
And all that's left its the emptiness inside of me
You murder my heart
Broke my trust and watch me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me

You're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me ---
