im not listening not anymore,
the more I love the more I know
Im not listening not anymore,
 no
'cause you gotta be bigger,
be faster,
be stronger,
if your gonna survive any longer,
in this life time it better be the right time,
cause your first time might be your last time,
am I a failure,
if i've got nothing to lose,
no im not a failure,
I've got something to prove!
im not listening not anymore,
the more I love the more I know,
Im not listening not anymore
the more I pay the more I know
the more I know
cuase ive lost my inocence
and im a stranger,
a life changer,
Im a man thats not afraid of danger
i walk my own path
I blaze my own trail
because im not afraid to derail
I wont get in line
and be a middle man
so fuck you I've made my own plans
and I've got respect
and I dont neglect the people I really care to protect
am I a failure
if ive got nothing to lose
no im not a failure
Ive got something to prove
im not listening not anymore
the more i love the more i know
im not listening not anymore
the more I pay the more i know
I told you before
I wont listen no more
I told you before
lets settle the score
i told you before 
I wont listen no more
i told you before
lets settle the score
if not me then who
If not now then when
if not me then who
if not now then when
Im not listening not anymore
the more I love the more I know
im not listening not anymore
the more I pay the more I know
I told you before
i wont listen no more
i told you before now lets settle the score
I told you before 
I wont listen no more
I told you before lets settle the score
shut it up put it up
blow it up set it up
fuck it up chuck it up
put it up blow it up right now!---Lyrics submitted by cree.
