God bless the coffin they carry me off in
God bless the coffin they carry me off in
They carry me off in

Ive walked amongst the living dead
And Im sick of the voices that are in my head
Ive taken the ride and Ive danced with death
I had nine lives and Ive got one left

Cause Ive got what you want
You've got that I need
Lets get together and keep me forever
Yeah waaaaaaahh!

Im harder than a coffin nail
Ive been to heaven; Ive been to hell
Im harder than a coffin nail
Ive been to heaven; Ive been to hell

I never thought Id need someones help
(I dont need your help)

Cause Ill handle it all and do it by myself
(Ill do this by myself)

I'm never alone till I hit rock bottom
(Im not afraid to fall)

Im so fucking stubborn and so fucking rotten
(Hit the bottom)

Cause Ive got what you want
You've got that I need
Lets get together and keep me forever
Yeah waaaaaaahh!

Im harder than a coffin nail
Ive been to heaven; Ive been to hell
Im harder than a coffin nail
Ive been to heaven; Ive been to hell

God bless the coffin they carry me off in...
God bless the coffin they carry me off in...

Cause Ive got what you want
You've got that I need
Lets get together and keep me forever
Yeah waaaaaaahh!

Im harder than a coffin nail
Ive been to heaven; Ive been to hell
Im harder than a coffin nail
Ive been to heaven; Ive been to hell

God bless the coffin they carry me off in!
God bless the coffin they carry me off in!---Lyrics submitted by emmie.
