Tell ya friends its a wolfpack party (2x)
Bitch im on dat pop shit
Yes im a baller
I move into the hills
Eight trips worth of farness
Different kind of diamonds
All the women love me
She asked about my job 
and I told her that its lovely
yes im famous
a celebrity
drinking crystal
clarity
tmz magazines paparazzi
barang bang tang 
fuck yu if yu dnt lyke me

Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Its a wolfpack party (4x)

Oooh I think she lyk me
Ya um from da stunt ish

Anywayz im on dat next level
All white cooper den space shuttle
Too fly so I got ya bitch eyein
She on my balls ya dat bitch like it
We doin diamonds check yo dam rhyming
Im so wet bitch I feel lyk im an island

Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Its a wolfpack party (4x)

Wet fresher den dey eva been
Yung giant sittin on da veteran
C da swag dat calvin letterman
Tell me who is better than 2800 Stunna Man
Catch me if yu can
I don think yu will
Hundred center fifties
We dont do da small bills
28s dnt ride small wheels
Im getting money 
so its fuck how a hater feels

Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Its a wolfpack party (4x)

Tell ya friends its a wolfpack party
All drinks on me cuz im ballin
Lyke girls so all girls invited
Pop a pill n lets roll lyk mitol
Seventy-five baby im da fliest
Whoever said I waznt big den dey r lyin

Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Its a wolfpack party (4x)---Lyrics submitted by RACHELLE.
