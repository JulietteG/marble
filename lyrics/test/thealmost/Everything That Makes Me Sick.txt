if my fault are your song 
Then i will not be content to sing along
if I'm the one that's making you so out of touch
Then why don't you just go ahead and...
Why dont you just go ahead

Blame it on this southern weather
Blame it on anything
i'ts not like you to ask small favours
You can blame for everything

if i'm the cause of all your sickness and pain
Then i'll bury my face in the hall of dirty shame
if this is just what getting so you out of touch
Why don't you just go ahead and...
Why dont you just go ahead and

Blame it on this southern weather
Blame it on anything
it's not like you to ask small favours
You can blame me for everything

This is my last plan to bury of all of your charm
This is my final rush to reach for you

Blame it on this southern weather
Blame it on anything
it's not like you to ask small favours
You can blame for everything---Lyrics submitted by rexzer.
