I'm on a mission 
That I think I can't handle 
It's hard to tough it out 
I need someone 
To get me through this 
Someone to pull me out 
There you stand 
There you stand 
Your heart in your hand 
Your heart in your hands 
There you are, there you are 
Waiting on me, there you are 
Waiting on me 

My God, my God 
I'll change my tune 
If you'll stay all night 
Come on, come on 
Let's comb the room 
We're looking for this 
To come around 
And make us young again 

It's good you're here 
Cause I've been better 
Yeah that's great 
Your news can wait 
So there you stand 
There you stand 
You've got your heart 
In your hands 
Your heart in your hands 
There you are, there you are 
Waiting on me 
Comb the room, comb the room 

I'm looking for this to end 
I'm looking for this to end---Lyrics submitted by Dylan.
