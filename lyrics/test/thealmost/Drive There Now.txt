Winter days make me say
What the hey
Let's say what we needed to say
Since way back when we sailed our inhibitions
Hold on tight cause this is so the truth (this is so the truth)

I love the way that we laugh until we cry
Dance until we die (dance until we die)
I love the smile with which you look at me and say
Get ready for this
And we get ready for this

I hope this gets you harder
I hope you act so much stronger
And I imagined honestly
It gets you every time
That I want it to honestly
Think you're strong

I love the way that we laugh until we cry
Dance until we die (dance until we die)
I love the smile with which you look at me and say
Get ready for this
And we get ready for this


I want you to remember me
When they tell you this is so insane
So insane

I love the way that we laugh until we cry
Dance until we die (dance until we die)
I love the smile with which you look at me and say
Get ready for this
And we get ready for this---Lyrics submitted by alyssa.
