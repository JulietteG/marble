With our hands up high, We're screaming,
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh, Whoa-Oh-Oh-oh.

I'm not afraid to make big mistakes, I'm not afraid to fall flat on my face.
I need to get this looked at, Need to get this looked at.
I need some time to think about, What I've done, Oh.
One last thing before I go..

With our hands up high, We're screaming,
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh, Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh.
And with our feet, We stomp a cadence for you.
With our hands up high, We're screaming,
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh, Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh.
And with our feet, We stomp cadence for you.

It's all free, and that's real, It's free, you said.
I need to accept, I need to forget, I guess.
I finally got this looked at, Finally got this looked at.
I'm so glad, You came for me.
Get this, Get this alright, Before we go.

With our hands up high, We're screaming,
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh, Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh
And with our feet, We stomp a cadence for you.
With our hands up high, We're screaming,
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh, Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh.
And with our feet, We stomp a cadence for you.

I am the one who made you! 
I am the one who made you! 
I am the one who made you!

With our hands up high, We're screaming,
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh, Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh
And with our feet, We stomp a cadence for you.
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh, Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh,
With our hands up high, We're screaming,
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh, Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh,
And with our feet, We stomp a cadence for you, Whoa-oh.---Lyrics submitted by nicole.
