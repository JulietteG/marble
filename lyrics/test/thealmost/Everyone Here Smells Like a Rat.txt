Irresponsible child get a hold on yourself
You look so different, when you lay your
Everything just where they can see it
You ask me where do I go
Everything falls out of place when you just don't know where to go

Everyone here know how important this is
Your faces make them look so serious
It will make them strong enough
You'll never be strong enough

My precious boy I know how hard this really must get
Just come down just get off
I'll give you half a manic get in the car lets go somewhere else
You need to chase away all the pain you think you feel
Scream yeah that your fears make you sane

Everyone here knows how important this is
Your faces make them look so serious 
It will make them strong enough
All of us here hate what we feel from you
We're not signified but we know what's true
You have to be strong enough

There's something more, well have to stop you now
I lived in grace, we'll make you leave the ground
There's something more, well have to stop you now
I lived in grace, we'll make you leave the ground

Everyone here knows how important this is
Your faces make them look so serious
It will make them strong enough
All of us here hate what we feel from you
We're not signified but we know what's true
You have to be strong enough
Everyone here---Lyrics submitted by Charde`a.
