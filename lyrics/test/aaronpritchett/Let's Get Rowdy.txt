You`ve got the band`s name on the marquis
Big old boy checking ID
Parking lot`s full of Harleys, farm trucks and SUVs

A crowd of people spilling in the door
Shoulder to shoulder on the dance floor
The drummer counts it off, the bartender pours.

Let`s get rowdy
College girls to cowboys
Came here to make noise
Turn it on and turn it up boys

Let`s get rowdy
Let`s get rowdy

We`ve got teenage girls sneaking in the back
Tattooed granny, she wants my hat.
But I know if I throw it I`m never going to get it back

Miss Alabama dancing on the bar
Some dude a` rockin` on an air guitar
Good people who waited all week just to party hard

Let`s get rowdy
College girls to cowboys
Came here to make noise
Turn it on and turn it up boys

Let`s get rowdy
Everybody raise a long neck
Common and show your red neck
Let me hear you say howdy

Let`s get rowdy
(inst)
College girls to cowboys
Came here to make noise
Turn it on and turn it up boys

Let`s get rowdy
Everybody raise a long neck
Common and show your red neck
Let me hear you say howdy

Let`s get rowdy
Let`s get rowdy
(Wait for it)
Let`s get rowdy

And let`s get crazy
I wanna get nuts nah nah
Let`s get crazy
Let`s get rowdy
Drive your mama crazy
Do you want a padded room nah nah nah
Let`s get rowdy
Let`s get nuts nah nah nah

Let`s get rowdy---Lyrics submitted by Liz.
