Three feet tall, five years old
Starin' down to the bottom
of Mountain Top road,
Hands wrapped tight
around those plastic handle grips
I took off flying pickin' up speed
The world was a blur of rocks and weeds
It was all worth the pain of landing
Getting my first three stitches
Everyone said that I shouldn't do it
Cut and bruised but I got through it
I still got the scars to prove it

Life's like a big wheel keeps on turning
Time runs away, every day I'm learning
To roll with the punches, follow my hunches
Loving the way it feels
Just to be alive
Getting the chance to ride on the big wheel

I'm takin my share of dead end curves
Had to steady my nerves and steal my courage
Had a lot of hard landings
but I ain't hanging up my wings
Yeah I'm still rippin' down that hill
Still hanging on with all my will
Lookin' back now I still
Wouldn't change a thing
I've had a few lovers leave their mark
I've broken my pride
and I've broken my heart
But I'm gonna live my life
before it all goes dark

Life's like a big wheel keeps on turning
Time runs away, every day I'm learning
To roll with the punches, follow my hunches
Loving the way it feels
Just to be alive
Getting the chance to ride on the big wheel

On the big wheel

Just to be alive
Getting the chance to ride on the big wheel
On the big wheel
On the big wheel
I'm still learning to ride on the big wheel
I'm still learning to ride on the big wheel
On the big wheel---Lyrics submitted by tashawna.
