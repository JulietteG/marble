I'd be lying if I said I was completely unscathed! 
I might be proving you right with my silence or my retaliation
Would I be letting you win in my nonreaction yeah
And how would I explain, and how would explain this to my children if I had them?

Because I can't not, because I can't not, because I can't afford to be misread one more time!

Would I be whining if I said I needed a hug?
Would you feel slighted if I said your loves not enough love....oooh...yeah
And how can I complain, and how can I complain when I'm the one who reaches for it?

Because I can't not, because I can't not, because I can't not walk without my crutches,
Because I can't not, because I can't not, because I can't help wonder why you ask me?

To all the unheard wisdom in the schoolyard, you think you're the right ones,
you think you're the chose ones I'm sure
And how can you go on with such conviction, and who do you think you are why do you question
me?

Because we can't not, because we can't not, because we can't help laugh at out underestimations, 
Because we can''t not, because we can't not, because we can't afford to be mislead one more time
Because we can't not, because we can't not, because we can't not help without your willingness!

why do you affect me...why do you affect me still, why do you hinder me, why do you hinder me still
why do you unnerve, why do you unnerve me still, why do you trigger, why do you trigger me still........---Lyrics submitted by Charley.
