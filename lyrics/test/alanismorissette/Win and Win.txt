In my old days someone won
Those were days of win-lose
In those bleak times i was better
I sat high: looking down my nose

Change direction: looking up
Im not worthy to be with you
We are separate Im inferior
I had yearnings to sit across from you

Cuz were eye to eye
We are win and win
We are equal to each other
We are flames of twin
We are offspring of truth
We are partner sister brother

Both directions speak a lie
Up or down, I cant feel you
As we battle with our power
We are separate, not looking across

Cuz were eye to eye
We are win and win
We are equal to each other
We are flames of twin
We are offspring of truth
We are partner sister brother

These delusions of our grandeur
We are locked in the struggle
These lies of status lower
These conclusions were in trouble

Cuz were eye to eye
We are win and win
We are equal to each other
We are flames of twin
We are offspring of truth
We are partner sister brother
