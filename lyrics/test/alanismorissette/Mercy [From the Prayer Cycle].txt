We have slaughtered 
In the garden of beauty 
Digging graves instead of planting 
Mercy for the crucified 
A bitter justice 
Begging eternity for love 

We're nothing 
We're everything 

I am nothing 
Yet I am everybody 

We're nothing 
And yet we are 

Wisdom lights up life's road 

I know you---Lyrics submitted by Courtney.
