I went to your house, walked up the stairs
Opened your door without ringing the bell
Walked down the hall into your room where I could smell you
And I shouldnt be here without permission. Shouldnt be here

Would you forgive me love
If I danced your shower
Would you forgive me love 
If I laid in your bed
Would you forgive me love 
If I stay all afternoon

I took off my clothes, put on your robe
Went through your drawers and found your cologne
Went down to the den and found your CDs and I played your joni
And I shouldnt stay long, you might be home soon, shouldnt stay long

Would you forgive me love
If I entered your shower
Would you forgive me love 
If I laid in your bed 
Would you forgive me love if I stay all afternoon

I burned your incense I ran a bath
Noticed a letter that sat on your desk
It said hello love, I love you so love, meet me at midnight
And no, it wasnt my writing
I better go soon, it wasnt my writing

So forgive me love
If I cry in your shower
So forgive me love
For the salt in your bed
So forgive me love
If I cry all afternoon.---Lyrics submitted by Nichele Jelks.
