Me and my helmet such an unconventional kid 
All intense and kinetic
At best tolerated from afar 

Not yet arrested, and by that, I mean betrothed 
Though at start I am newly coated 
I've just not been trusted with alters 

I'm a sweet piece of work
Well intentioned yet disturbed 
Wrongly labeled and under fed
Treated like a rose as an orchid 

My friends, as they weigh in 
Get understandably protective 
They have a hard time being objective 
So inside we cancel each other out 

I'm a sweet piece of work
Well intentioned and unloved 
Unlabeled and misunderstood
Treated like a rose as an orchid 

You've brought water to me
Making sure my bloom rebounds 
You know best of what my special care allows 

So I've lived in my blind spot 
Thought myself usual when I am not 
And your garden is a nice spot 
As long as it is brave end where you are 

For this sweet piece of work
High maintenance and deserted 
I've been different and deserving 
Treated like a rose as an orchid 

Sweet piece of work
Overwhelmed unobserved 
I've been bowed down to but so misread 
Treated like a rose as an orchid---Lyrics submitted by Anngie.
