Oh papa sit down, and hear my song 
oh, and if you feel like it then please sing along 
no nothing that i wanna say i havent said before but to use your words 
you can never be to sure
See even though, i dont always show , i'm glad that you're around
I said i'm glad that your around

Oh son its so strange, to hear and see
That someone so different is a soul like me
You may have gone right, where i would have gone left
But son thats alright, i will always have your back

See even though i dont always show, i'm proud that your my son
Old days, and all of the new. Wanting to be like you
Every time i look at you i see myself 
I'm so proud of you
For you have made me what i am, a better man
I'm just so proud of you
O day your views in life, tell me how they came to be
Well see i didnt know my father, like the way that you know me

Son life is just to short, for us to never be in touch 
Ho thats why i wanna tell you that i love you very much 
Oh even though i dont always show, you know . . 
And i want you to know that  . .
every time i look at you, i see myself and i'm so proud of you
You have made me what i am, a better man 
I'm just so proud of you

I'm here, and i'll be if i can
A father and a friend
Oooh every time i look at you 
Every time i look at you (what you see) i see myself and i'm so proud of you
You will made me what i am, a son and a friend
I'm just so proud of you
You know that one day too, i'll be walking in your shoes
And i know that you'll do fine, cause your a son of mine

Ohh dear papa tell me what you've learned, So that i dont get my fingers burned
Son you'll see that as you go, You'll make mistakes of your own
But thats okay man, see you live and you learn
You live and you learn---Lyrics submitted by abbie.
