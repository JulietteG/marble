Tryina hide emotions, pride won't let it show
And find myself wanting you more
You're so afraid to falling, back to where we started
Can't deny where you were before
So, you ain't going nowhere
Used to be us, young and in love
Let's take it back right now
You ain't going nowhere
You're still mine
Eyes don't lie
Let's take it back, remember loving me
I still can light your fire
Remember loving me
I still can light your fire
Remember loving me
I know when we touch, you fall back in love
Girl, we know what it was
Remember loving me,
I know when we touch, you fall back in love
Girl, there's no better us

Can't predict the moment, I don't know where we're going
Here and now is where you should be
So, why you're hesitating? Both know how it ends
I don't have to convince you to leave
So, you ain't going nowhere
Used to be us, young and in love
Let's take it back right now
You ain't going nowhere
You're still mine
Eyes don't lie
Let's take it back, remember loving me
I still can light your fire
Remember loving me
I still can light your fire
Remember loving me
I know when we touch, you fall back in love
Girl, we know what it was
Remember loving me,
I know when we touch, you fall back in love
Girl, there's no better us

Baby, I'm up now
Remember loving me
Baby, I'm up now
Remember loving me---
