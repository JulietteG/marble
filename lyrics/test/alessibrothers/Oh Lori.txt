I'd like to stay in love with you
All summer and after fall
I'll keep you warm through the winter
Because I've noticed one thing
This ain't no summer fling	     	    	 

I'd like to ride my bicycle with you
On the handlebars
You'd laugh and run away
And I'd chase you through the meadow
Without you I'd die
Let's never say good-bye 	      	    	 

 Oh,   Lori
You bring the spring, the summer, 	fall
Ooo and winter By the season
Oh, Lori (oh, Lori)
You make me feel as though I've been born again
Born again        	 

You danced for me in your bare feet
That mellow afternoon
When we made love to each other
And I'm loving you
That's all I want to do 	      	    	 

Oh, Lori
You bring the spring, the summer, fall
Ooo and winter By the season
Oh, Lori (oh, Lori)
You make me feel as though I've been born again
Born again        	 
(repeat)---Lyrics submitted by ULI.
