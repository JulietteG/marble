Here's some advise for the next one
Don't let him lead you to the dark
Don't tell him all your secrets
He'll leave you with a broken heart
He'll try and tell you that he wants you
Just to keep you on the line
Arrive in Europe, about to move on
He pulls you back every time

Here's some advise for the next one
Run, run, run
Here's some advise for the next one
Run, run, run

Darling I know that you're just like me
You give your love up way too fast
But once it's gone it's gone forever
And there's coming back from that
He's got this perfect way about him
He'll make you think that you come first
But you'll get lost in the challenge
You're trying not to get hurt

Here's some advise for the next one
Run, run, run
Here's some advise for the next one
Run, run, run

Don't even search for that four-letter world
You'll never get it out
You try, and try, and try
But he'll just shut you down
Don't wanna say I told you so
So please go now

Here's some advise for the next one
Run, run, run
Here's some advise for the next one
Run, run, run---
