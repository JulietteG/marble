Oh yeah Oh yeah
I am Jah cure
Them see me walk in Jah earth
And them say me not working
Worse up the mission
But them couldnt hurt me
Through the powers of the word
They couldnt reverse this
A Jah Jah work
Every man deserve this

Eh! I man a soldier, Vision of Glory
I see it clear, everything you throw at me
You seen your teaching, you tell me your story
I and I journey inspire my story hey!
My reward isnt here on earth
Hey hey
Every man must know his worth

Though we trodding right through the valley
I fear no flesh on earth
Aint no doubt about it, coz jah rule the universe

Even though we walk right through the valley
I fear no flesh on earth
Aint no doubt about it, Jah rule the universe Oh!

I am Jah cure, to the world

Dont watch the things that them say
Coz they will lead you astray

Know what them games that they play
No way no way

Your reward isnt here on earth
Hey hey
Nothing is there for no reward

Though we trodding right through the valley
I fear no flesh on earth
Aint no doubt about it, coz Jah rule the universe

Even though we walk right through the valley
I fear no flesh on earth
Aint no doubt about it, coz Jah rule the universe oh

Though we trodding right through the valley
I fear no flesh on earth
Aint no doubt about it, coz Jah rule the universe

Even though we walk right through the valley
I fear no flesh on earth
Aint no doubt about it, coz Jah rule the universe oh

I am Jah cure, for the world
Just want you to know---
