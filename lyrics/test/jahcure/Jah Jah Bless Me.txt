Chorus:

I know jah jah bless me'
No wicket heart can test me
No matter how they try
Know jah manifest me
And my fans ah request me
Nah go make di river run dry

Verse 1:

As far as the wind blow
From the west to the east side
I and I praises never cease (oh lord)
Emperor Salassie i  never cease the judgment 
Of the wicket man keep
I know they must get defeat (oh lord)
So ghetto youths be wise
And open up your eyes
Because (yea ya, yea yea)

[Chorus]

Verse 2:

Why keep fighting in your mind
When you know it can not help
Thoughts of you is so unkind
Wonder what is under your vail
The fool shall depart from his will
So clean up your heart
before you end up 
Jah jah say, you should never dis the righteous
You'll never make from you unjust 

[Chorus]

As far as the wind blow
From the west to the east side
I and I praises never ceased
Emperer salassie i the judgment never cease
of the wicket man keep
I know they must get defeat
Ghetto youths be wised
and oper up your eyes 
Because.....
