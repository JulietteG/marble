Baby, I understand da reason why you're leavin'
But dat doesn't make it any easier to bear
I know dat I played dis game a fool wen I was cheatin'
Now I'm cryin'
(Now I'm cryin')

Said I lost it, my intentions was not clear
(Was not clear)
But I was messin' wit' your feelin's, I didn't care
But I love you
(But I love you)
But I love you, yeah
(But I love you)

So I'll cry if you won't take me there
(If you won't take me there)
To your arms of love
(To your arms)

So I'll cry if you won't take me there
(If you won't take me there)
To your arms of love, yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
(To your arms)
(To your arms of love)

Sunshiny days, brighten my life
Again, again
(To your arms)
Wen I'm with you, I feel so alive forever
'Cause wen I am down, down and out
You lift me up off my route

'Cause, baby, I will
(Baby, I will)
Love you until forever forever we'll be
You and for all time
We'll be, we'll be---
