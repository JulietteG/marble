Baby, only for you
Lady, only for you

What will it take my love to show you
I'm still in love with you?
What will it take my love to show you
How much my love is true?

Feeling she gave to me
Makes me feel so brand new
Love you forever
And there's no other like you

Baby i know i hurt you twice
Promise i'll never hurt you no more
Although i know it's not nice
Promise i'll never go back through that door

Although you've got your choice
Please make sure the first is the Cure
I make my sacrifice, only you
No one before

What will it take my love to show you
I'm still in love with you?
What will it take my love to show you
How much my love is true?

Feeling she gave to me
Makes me feel so brand new
Love you forever
And there's no other like you
Baby, no one but you

Many a times i've tried it
Baby, i can't deny it
I just can't live my life
A day in this world without you

What will it take my love to show you
I'm still in love with you?
What will it take my love to show you
How much my love is true?

Feeling she gave to me
Makes me feel so brand new
Love you forever
And there's no other like you

You, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
This is so special, I tell you girl
For someone special living in my world
Yes, only for you

The things that i do, Oh baby
Girl open your heart and let love through
Like every ocean shores where the rivers ensue
Back to the arms of the Cure where she wanna run

Let me tell you for sure
You're welcome back too
Baby, anytime you want to
Lady my love is gonna haunt you, mmm, yeah

What will it take my love to show you
I'm still in love with you?
What will it take my love to show you
How much my love is true?

What will it take my love?
Take my love?
To show you that i'm still in love with you---Lyrics submitted by Siobhan.
