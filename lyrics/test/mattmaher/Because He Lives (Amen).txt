I believe in the son
I believe in the risen one
I believe I overcome
By the power of his blood

Amen
Amen
I'm alive
I'm alive
Because He lives
Amen
Amen
Let my song join the one that never ends
Because He lives

I was dead in the grave
I was covered in sin and shame
I heard mercy call my name
He rolled the stone away

Amen
Amen
I'm alive
I'm alive
Because He lives
Amen
Amen
Let my song join the one that never ends
Because He lives

Because He lives
I can face tomorrow
Because He lives
Every fear is gone
I know He holds my life my future in His hands

Amen
Amen
I'm alive
I'm alive
Because He lives
Amen
Amen
Let my song join the one that never ends

Amen
Amen
I'm alive
I'm alive
Because He lives
Amen
Amen
Let my song join the one that never ends

Because He lives
Because He lives---
