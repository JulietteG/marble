well i guess itsallright.
but baby who can say whats right
all we ever whore was lovers in the night

all them thing i have seeing take its down to where im feeling free, a part of what it is was, for lovers in the night

theres another town this time and the boy looks the same.
theres another gilr this time but the feeling still the remains

i been running out og whisky and one night stands, sometimes you have too live that way
couse thats a part og what it is, for lovers in the night

SOLO


and theres another town this time and the boy looks the same.
theres another gilr this time but the feeling still the remains

so if you hear this song, and i hope you will.
i tried to help it up that hill
that`s a part of what it is for lovers in the night

lovers in the night x3---Lyrics submitted by Anders.
