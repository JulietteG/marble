Everybody's got a holiday
Some got Christmas and new years
But every Friday's mine, I got fifty two a year

Friday is my day (Friday is my day)
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday is my day
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday I get my money and my woman
Cause Friday is my holiday

The world stops on Friday
And I start having me a ball
Cause I got a good feeling
And I don't feel no pain at all

Friday is my day (Friday is my day)
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday is my day
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday I get my money and my woman
Cause Friday is my holiday

I go down to my job
and get my pay
stop at a juke joint
and I'm on my way
she meets me at the door
with a great big smile
and says come on here daddy
you gonna be here for awhile

Friday is my day (Friday is my day)
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday is my day
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday I get my money and my woman
Cause Friday is my holiday

She pulled the curtain
and dimmed the lights
we bump and grind
all night
she looks up at me
with a sly grin
and started telling me
the shape she's in

Friday is my day (Friday is my day)
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday is my day
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday I get my money and my woman
Cause Friday is my holiday

The house man is beeping
about the rent
she run her hand in my pocket
and I tell her don't leave a damn cent
But baby keep on
just keep on getting down
I'll be back when Friday
When Friday rolls around

Friday is my day (Friday is my day)
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday is my day
My day to play (Friday is my day, Friday is my day to Play)
Friday I get my money and my woman
Cause Friday is my holidayLyrics posted by cbeck747 from Alaska.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
