They say your caddy ain't been driven right
They say you don't want that thang to idle all night
Let me work on it, baby
I'll fix it up for you
I'll have your motor purring like a kitten 
Girl, when I get through

(Chorus) 
So baby don't panic
Cause I'm the shadetree mechanic
So baby don't panic
Cause I'm the shadetree mechanic

You say your generator aint working too fine
They tell me you need your front end aligned
You don't have to worry
Cause I'll take care of that
I'll stop your radiator from steaming
I'll adjust the thermostat

(Chorus) 
So baby don't panic
Cause I'm the shadetree mechanic
So baby don't panic
Cause I'm the shadetree mechanic

They say you ain't had a good tuneup in a long long while
I'll give you good service with a smile
I'll solve all your problems
If you let me under your hood
I'll change your oil
I'll fill it up
I'll lubricate it good

(Chorus) 
So baby don't panic
Cause I'm the shadetree mechanic
So baby don't panic
Cause I'm the shadetree mechanic
So baby don't panic
Cause I'm the shadetree mechanic
Don't panic, baby---Lyrics submitted by Cee Stev.
