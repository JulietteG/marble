You steady me
Slow and sweet we sway
Take the lead and I will follow

Finally ready now
To close my eyes and just believe
That you wont lead me where you dont go

When my faith gets tired
And my hope seems lost
You spin me round and round
And remind me of that song
The one you wrote for me

And we dance
And we dance

Ive been told
To pick up my sword
And fight for love
Little did I know
That love had won for me

Here in your arms
You still my heart again
And I breathe you in
Like Ive never breathed till now

When my faith gets tired
And my hope seems lost
You spin me round and round
And remind me of that song
The one you wrote for me

And we dance
And we dance
And we dance
And we dance
Just you and me

And I will lock eyes
With the one whos ransomed me
The one who gave me joy from mourning

And I will lock eyes
With the one whos chosen me
The one who set my feet to dancing

We dance
Just you and me

Its nice to know
Im not alone
Ive found my home here in your arms---
