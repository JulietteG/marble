My eyes have now been fixed
My heart has now been set on love
Ive turned my gaze to this
The One whom which my soul cries out for

There is none Ive known
That holds my heart as You do now
Ive made for you a home
A place where love can grow and be found

Draw to me Jesus
Ive made my heart a home
My love is Jesus
My love is You alone

It will not, it will never be enough
Just to know about You Jesus but never call You my own
For my, my heart was made for love
I cant live without You Jesus

It will not, it will never be enough
Just to know about You Jesus and never call You my own
For my, my heart was made for God
I cant live without You Jesus

Draw to me Jesus, Ive made my heart a home
Draw to me Jesus, Ive made my heart a home---
