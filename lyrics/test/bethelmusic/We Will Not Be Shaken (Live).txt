(feat. Brian Johnson)

For we trust in our God 
And through His unfailing love 
We will not be shaken 
We will not be shaken 
We will not be shaken 

Though the battle rages 
We will stand in the fight 
Though the armies rise up against us on all sides 
We will not be shaken 
We will not be shaken 
We will not be shaken 

For in the hour of our darkest day 
We will not tremble, we wont be afraid 
Hope is rising like the light of dawn 
Our God is for us He has overcome 

All those against Him will fall 

For our God is stronger 

He can do all things 
No higher name we can call 
For Jesus is greater 
We can do all things---
