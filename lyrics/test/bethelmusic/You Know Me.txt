You have been and you will be
You have seen and you will see

You know when I rise and when I fall
when I come or go you see it all
you hung the stars and you move
the sea and still you know me

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
you know me 
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Repeat)

And nothing is hidden from your sight
Where ever I go you find me
And you know every detail of my life
and you are God and you don't miss a thing
(Repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Tyana Johnson.
