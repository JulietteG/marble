Where would I be
If it wasnt for Your kindness toward me
Youve been closer than a friend could ever be
There is nothing on the Earth that could take Your place

I am undone
For You see all there was and all that will be
Yet youve set your vast affection upon me
By Your voice the world was made and still You called my name

Who can compare to You
Who moves my heart the way You do
Who can compare to You
Who moves my heart the way You do

Kingdoms come and kingdoms fade
But always You remain
Ages pass and seasons change
But always You remain the same---
