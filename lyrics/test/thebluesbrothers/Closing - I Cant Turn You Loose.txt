I can't turn you too loose now
If I do, I'm gonna lose my life
I can't ever turn you too loose now
If I do, I'm gonna lose my life

Well, I can't turn you lose nobody
'Cause I love you baby, yes I do, oh, babe
Hip shakin' mama, I told ya
I, I'm in love with only you
Honey, baby, do it baby, why don't ya?
I wanna give you everything that you want

Gotta, gotta, now
Gotta keep on holdin' on
Never gonna turn you loose, now
Gotta keep a grip on you, babe

I can't turn you loose now
I'm in love with the prettiest thing
I can't ever turn you loose now
What a joy true love you can bring, now

Well, I can't turn you loose to nobody
'Cause I love you, baby, yes I do
Hip shakin' mama, I told ya
I, I'm in love with only you
Honey, baby, do it baby, why don't ya?
I'm gonna give you everything that you want

Gotta, gotta, now
Gotta keep on holdin' on
Never gonna turn you loose
Gotta keep a grip on you, babe

Gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta keep on holdin' on
I can't turn you loose
I gotta keep a grip on you
I can't turn you loose
I got to keep on holdin' on
I can't turn you loose

Early in the mornin'
I love you woman
Late in the evenin'
I love you more

Gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta

Gotta keep on holdin' on
Can't turn you loose

Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Hold on, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta keep holdin' on
Can't turn you loose

Gotta keep a grip on you
I can't turn you loose
Gotta keep on holdin' on
I can't turn you loose---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
