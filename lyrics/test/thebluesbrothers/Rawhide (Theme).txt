Rollin', rollin', rollin' 
Though the streams are swollen 
Keep them dogies rollin' 
Rawhide! 
Rain and wind and weather 
Hell-bent for leather 
Wishin' my gal was by my side. 
All the things I'm missin', 
Good vittles, love, and kissin', 
Are waiting at the end of my ride 

CHORUS 
Move 'em on, head 'em up 
Head 'em up, move 'em on 
Move 'em on, head 'em up 
Rawhide 
Count 'em out, ride 'em in, 
Ride 'em in, count 'em out, 
Count 'em out, ride 'em in 
Rawhide! 

Keep movin', movin', movin' 
Though they're disapprovin' 
Keep them dogies movin' 
Rawhide! 
Don't try to understand 'em 
Just rope, throw, and brand 'em 
Soon we'll be living high and wide. 
My hearts calculatin' 
My true love will be waitin', 
Be waitin' at the end of my ride. 

Rawhide!
