Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rawhide!

Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Though the streams are swollen
Keep them doggies rollin',
Rawhide

Rain and wind and weather
Hell bent for leather
Wishin' my gal was by my side

All the things I'm missin'
Good vittles, love and kissin'
Are waiting at the end of my ride

Move 'em on
(Head em' up!)
Head em' up
(Move 'em on!)
Move 'em on
(Head em' up!)
Rawhide!

Cut 'em out
(Ride 'em in!)
Ride 'em in
(Cut em' out!)
Cut 'em out
Ride 'em in,
Rawhide!

Keep movin', movin', movin'
Though they're disaprovin'
Keep them doggies movin',
Rawhide

Don't try to understand 'em
Just rope, throw, and brand 'em
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide

My heart's calculatin'
My true love will be waitin'
Be waitin' at the end of my ride

Move 'em on
(Head em' up!)
Head em' up
(Move 'em on!)
Move 'em on
(Head em' up!)
Rawhide!

Cut em' out
(Ride 'em in!)
Ride 'em in
(Cut em' out!)
Cut em' out
Ride 'em in,
Rawhide!

Yah! (whip crack)

Move 'em on
(Head em' up!)
Head em' up
(Move 'em on!)
Move 'em on
(Head em' up!)
Rawhide!

Cut em' out
(Ride 'em in!)
Ride 'em in
(Cut em' out!)
Cut em' out
Ride 'em in,
Rawhide!

Rollin' rollin',rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin' Yah! (whip crack)
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rawhiiide

Yah! (whip crack)

Rawhide!---
