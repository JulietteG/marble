Hole in my soul

Well there's an empty, empty space down in my heart, baby
I've got an empty, empty place, (unintelligible), baby
It's not gonna mend with glue
It's only gonna mend with you
So sit down in this chair, girl
And then we can declare, girl
Uh, there's a hole in my soul now baby
I'm gonna lose control now girl
Well so many said don't lose your head
But girl what can I do?

You cannot treat it with a roll or patch now, baby
You cannot close it like you're out to lunch now, baby
It's not gonna seal with tape
For me there's no escape
The misery and sorrow
For me there's no tomorrow
Not with this hole in my soul now baby
I'm gonna lose control now girl
Well so many said don't lose my head
But girl what can I do?

One-two-three, look at me
I'm in love with you
One-two-three, look at me
I'm in love with you

It's not gonna mend with glue
It's only gonna mend with you
So sit down in this chair, girl
And then we can declare, girl
Uh, there's a hole in my soul now baby
I'm gonna lose control now girl
I got a hole in my soul now baby
I'm gonna lose control now girl
I got a hole in my soul now baby
I'm gonna lose control now girl
