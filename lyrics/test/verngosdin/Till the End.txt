If I never see your lovin' face again,
I'll go on lovin' you
Till the end.
And if my broken heart and I don't find a way to mend,
I'll go on lovin' you
Till the end.
The years and miles may separate you from me,
The pain may lessen more as time goes by.
But as for me the memories will never dim,
And I'll go on lovin you
Till the end.
If we're ever free to love again
I know
Straight to your waiting arms
is where I'll go.
And there I'll stay forever
and I'll prove to you again
I'll go on lovin' you
Till the end
I'll go on lovin' you 
Till the end...........---Lyrics submitted by Keith.
