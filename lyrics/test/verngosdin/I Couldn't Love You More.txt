If you would always love me, the way you love me now
There wouldnt be a mountain I couldnt climb
Your smile is like the sunshine, your tears like the rain
Youve added so much to this life of mine

And I feel the feeling growing stronger
And every day I seem to love you more
God gave us the need for each other
And I couldnt love you more, than the way that Im loving you now

Im growing used to loving you and having you around
I dont recall a time you let me down
And when youre here beside me, to love me and to guide me
Im amazed at the world that I have found

And I feel the feeling growing stronger
And every day I seem to love you more
God gave us the need for each other
And I couldnt love you more than the way that Im loving you now
Oh, I couldnt love you more than the way that Im loving you now---Lyrics submitted by Jim Newkirk.
