underneath the moon, underneath the stars
heres a little heart for you
up above the world, up above it all
heres a hand to hold on to

but if i should break, if i should fall away
what am i to do?
i need someone to take, a little of the weight
or ill fall through

Chorus:
you're just the one that i've been waiting for
i'll give you all that i have to give and more
but dont let me fall

take a little time, walk a little line
got the balance right
give a little love, gimme just enough
so that i can hang on tight

we will be alright, ill be by your side
i wont let you down
but i gotta know, no matter how things go
that you will be around

Chorus

Dont let me fall

underneath the moon, underneath the stars
heres a little heart for you
up above the world, up above it all
heres a hand to hold on to

Chorus

you'll be the one that Ill love forever more
ill be here holding you high above it all
but dont let me fall---Lyrics submitted by Tina.
