So tired of feeling blue
Such a heavy weight on you
So shake it off and make your way to somewhere different
To somewhere different

Oh no, now you're leaving me, oh what will you do?
All alone in the big bad world but i'm not worried
No


'Cause you're gonna skip along
Quite merrily baby
You're gonna revel in hating what's going on
And you're like a sugar bomb and no harm will come
No harm will come if you just skip along

Acting oblivious comes natural to us
Keep smiling knowing all the while the world will fall apart
The world will fall apart
ah....aaaa...


So we're gonna skip along
Oh quite merrily baby
We're gonna revel in hating what's going on
And you're like a sugar bomb and no harm will come
No harm will come if we just skip along

Wouldn't be lovely home, home?
Safe and sound with no one round to bring us down
But that's far away


So I'm gonna skip along
Quite merrily baby
I'm gonna revel in hating what's going on
And I'm like a sugar bomb and no harm will come
No harm will come if I just skip along


Yeahwe're gonna skip along
Quite merrily baby
We're gonna revel in hating what's going on
And you're like a sugar bomb, bomb, bomb and no harm will come
No harm will come if we just skip along
Skip along
Skip along 
No harm will come if we just skip along---Lyrics submitted by Hadrian.
