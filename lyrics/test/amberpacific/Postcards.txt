I'll quote clever line like hope
I'll take the final words you wrote
To make them feel like bliss
As always as I'll take the praise
I have a way with making things
Scripted like a song that makes you sting

I need you here with me
So here's our heart to heart
On the back of postcards sent from California
Remember when I said
Just stay what you are
I know you hate the feeling when I walk away
When I'm without you I'm not the man that I know I can be
Because your not here with me

You can break my heart open
And ruin my epic ending
Your hand like a noose around my neck
But the next time you say
"Promise me"
I'll make
One for myself to always stay what I am

I need you here with me
So here's our heart to heart
On the back of postcards sent from California
When I'm without you I'm not the man that I know I can be
Because your not here with me

I need you here with me
So here's our heart to heart
On the back of postcards sent from California
When I'm without you I'm not the man that I know I can be
Remember when I said
Just stay what you are
I know you hate the feeling when I walk away
When I'm without you I'm not the man that I know I can be
Because your not here with me---Lyrics submitted by lyndon.
