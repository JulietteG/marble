Temporary, but that's the way it has to be....

Its in my heart, i felt your world just come to rest
I should of gone out on your last breath 
slowly fading with these days we choose to miss
keep holding on, its not to late don't make this seem
like there is nothing left to be 
there's so much more to life 
we tin to just forget 
don't forget.........

Its just temporary
we'll give it time to know it real
Be for your ready...
Facing every day with me
Your life worth living
for some one to give all they feel
Your heart stops beating
So give you self another chance
Change...........
when tomorrow becomes a better day

Its time to start, to face the thing that you fear most
To know your better off alone
to stand up fighting, with your will to carry on
Its only then, when you'll find side that you don't know
your finding path, just take them slow
step by step you find, its easy to forget
don't forget.......


Its just temporary
we'll give it time to know it real
Be for your ready...
Facing every day with me
Your life worth living
for someone to give all they feel
Your heart stops beating
So give you self another chance
she say...........
You swear you live by what you know 
you take an angle then let it go
sometime then not we let them fall

Its just temporary
we'll give it time to know it real
Be for your ready...
Facing every day with me
Your life worth living
for some one to give all they feel
Your heart stops beating

Its just temporary
well that the way it has to be
but ordinary
It takes away from every thing
Its just temporary
But that the way it has to be---Lyrics submitted by Kailyn.
