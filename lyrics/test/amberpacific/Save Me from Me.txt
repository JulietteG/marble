If you only knew the pain 
The pain I keep inside 
The pain that makes me "me" 
Then without it who am I 
In a room with broken walls 
I lay in scene and dreams 
I want you to see 

I'm cold and white 
I'm holding on 
I'll try to breathe for you 
I'm crying out 
I'm singing loud 
You could be all I need 

and i'm losing my will
just to hold you in
and i'm giving up the hope 
that you could have been the one
to save me from me
and now our lips will meet
and i'll taste their defeat
i'll give in this once

i'm cold and white
i'm holding on
i'll try to breathe for you
i'm crying out
i'm singing loud
you could be all i need

still i know
i'll carry on
guide me through the life i lost
to find these faults in me
to find these faults in me

i'm cold and white 
i'm holding on
i'll try to breathe for you
i'm crying out
i'm singing loud
you could be all i need

i'm cold and white
i'm holding on
i'll try to breathe for you 
i'm crying out
i'm singing loud
you could be all i need

To save me from me.---Lyrics submitted by serena.
