=POETICALLY PATHETIC BY AMBER PACIFIC= 

Thinking of the words to say
I'd like to think that this was fate
Reference to a song you love
Spell confusion with a k
Like a star without its strings
I'm hanging here on these two wings
For that smile and those eyes...
(I'm falling)

If time could stop, how could I make this more poetic
When there's nothing more pathetic to be said...?

You bring me out, show me light
I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside
You carry truth, you make me smile
If it were you and me tonight
I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you
For you...

If you ever had the chance
Would you make your life seem right?
Or would you only hold it back
The good times, the hard, and the bad
Whatever you say is all right
Just as long as there's no doubt
Could you look me in the eyes...
(and say hope's died)

If time could stop, how could I make this more poetic?
When there's nothing more pathetic to be said...

You bring me out, show me light
I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside
You carry truth, you make me smile
If it were you and me tonight
I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you

Our wish
Each time
Keeps me returning to you
Night after night...
Lift me up as high as the clouds that warm the sky
For you and I...

You bring me out, show me light
I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside
You carry truth, you make me smile
If it were you and me tonight
I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you...

You bring me out, show me light
I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside
You carry truth, you make me smile
If it were you and me tonight
I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you
For you (for you)...---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
