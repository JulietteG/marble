I'm taking it in
I'm holding it back
I'm filling my lungs with the knife in my back
But you kept going on just to make me feel like this
Now that it's over
I won't feel the same
A broken frame with our picture is wasted
I've thrown it away
Losing sight
You were all I had
All I could take
I guess the jokes on me

We missed our chance
I won't forget
As time will only tell where to go
Though I wish that you weren't breathing
I still just can't believe
You're gone

And I was looking for something
But I came up with nothing
Not a reason to leave or let this out
But you kept going on
Just to make me feel like this
And now that it's over
I won't feel the same
A broken friendship was worth it
I'll scrap any thoughts with your name
Still I long for you to stay
I'd take back anything

We missed our chance
I won't forget
As time will only tell where to go
(Time will only tell where you go)
Though I wish that you weren't breathing
I still just can't believe
You're gone

We missed our chance
I won't forget
As time will only tell where to go
(Time will only tell where you go)
Though I wish that you weren't breathing
I still just can't believe
You're gone

We missed our chance
I won't forget
As time will only tell where to go
(Time will only tell where you go)
Though I wish that you weren't breathing
I still just can't believe
You're gone---Lyrics submitted by akmal.
