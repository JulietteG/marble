I never dreamt it'd be this way 
I've lost any chance for me to say 
To say that I miss you, say that I love you 
Will someone please tell me I'm okay 

I wasn't prepared for what's to come 
A life made of memories gone so young 
And now I'm regretting all I've done 
But in your heart know that I'm with you all along 

Wherever you go, I will be waiting 
Whenever you call, I will be there 
Whatever it takes, I'll make your darkest days so bright 
I'm in your heart tonight 

I never thought that this could go 
And take me away from all I know 
And leave me to think I'm on my own 
But your love will take me, you were the one... 

...Who sat through nights 
You held me tight 
And made sure I'm okay 
And I thank you for the love you gave to me 

Wherever you go, I will be waiting 
Whenever you call, I will be there 
Whatever it takes, I'll make your darkest days so bright 
I'm in your heart tonight... 

Tonight... 

Wherever you go, I will be waiting 
Whenever you call, I will be there 
Whatever it takes, I'll make your darkest days so bright 
Wherever you go, I will be waiting 
Whenever you call, I will be there 
Whatever it takes, I'll make your darkest days so bright 
And if I should fall, I know you're waiting 
And if I should call, I know you're there 
If ever you cry just know
I'm in your heart tonight... 
I'm in your heart tonight.---Lyrics submitted by ian.
