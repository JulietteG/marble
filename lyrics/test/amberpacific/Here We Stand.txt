=HERE WE STAND BY AMBER PACIFIC= 

Here we stand again 
Another day has passed us 
With its lack of change 
And all we have is what we share 
And all we want is someone else to be there 

And if the sun will set tonight 
Hold our secrets up to the sky 
As our shadows grow there's nothing left to hide 
And if you ever doubt 
You will know that I still wonder 
How many times that I've compared 
The stars to your eyes 

We will make it through 
No matter the cost, we've gone this far 
Why not find out how it works out for you and me 
We'll make it through 
I thought we were lost 
But somehow we haven't found a way 
And I hope that we never do 

It's hard to get to understand 
When our own lives are in our hands 
And don't stop when you've never been closer 
Just 'cause you don't know what matters most 
So it won't always be so clearly right in front of us 

And if the sun will set tonight 
Hold our secrets up to the sky 
As our shadows grow there's nothing left to hide 
And if you ever doubt 
You will know that I still wonder 
How many times that I've compared 
The stars to your eyes 

We will make it through 
No matter the cost we've gone this far 
Why not find out how it works out for you and me 
We'll make it through 
I thought we were lost 
But somehow we haven't found a way 
And I hope that we never do 
Never do 

Doesn't really matter how it all began 
Forsaken 
Got this far without knowing who we truly are 

I will never doubt that 
We will make it through 
No matter the cost we've gone this far 
Why not find out how it works out for you and me 
We'll make it through 
I thought we were lost 
But somehow we haven't found a way 
And I hope that we never do---Lyrics submitted by Mary.
