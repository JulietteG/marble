he wants to give her everything she wants
all of the sins in her mind
all of her enemies fallen and cryin, yeah
all of the tear drops on her tongue

it's in her conscience
that whatever god gives 
her someone to mourn
who cares what god is
or hat a guitar is
or that you were born

monki

he wanted you 

monki

he wanted you

and when he stops saying thing you want to hear
pull up your knickers in a mood
he wants to outclass these
crass devotees
deletes your picture from his phone

it's in his conscince 
that musical notes give him
someone to mourn

who cares what god is
or what a guitar is
or that you were born

monki

she wanted you

monki

she wanted you---Lyrics submitted by Khari Thompson.
