Love you in the morning
Love you all through the night
Said I love you in the morning
Love you all through the night

I don't know why I ever let you go
Cause all the time I knew that I loved you so
And I need a little bit of loving
Need a little bit of kissing and
I need a little bit of loving
Love you all day and night
Its as
Easy as can be
Oh, easy as can be
Yeah, easy as can be
Yeah, easy as can be

Love you in the morning
Love you all through the night
Said I love you in the morning
Love you all through the night

I don't know why I ever let you go
Cause all the time I knew that I loved you so
And I need a little bit of loving
Need a little bit of kissing and
I need a little bit of loving
Love you all day and night
Its as
Easy as can be
Oh, easy as can be
Yeah, easy as can be
Oh, easy as can be

Easy as can be
Yes, easy as can be
Oh, easy as can be
Yes, easy as can be

Easy as can be
Yes, easy as can be
Yeah, easy as can be
Yeah, easy as can be

Easy as can be
