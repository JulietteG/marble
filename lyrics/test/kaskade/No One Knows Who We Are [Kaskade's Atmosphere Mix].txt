We are shouting
We are whispering
We give it all
We have nothing
Built our houses on our hands
We are confident in our own plans
Here we sleep and here we stand

We are right now

Oh woah oh
No one knows who we are
Oh woah oh
No one gave us a mark [x2]

We have held back
We have pushed on
We can control
We can look on

We're not searching for a name
Or looking back the way we came
We're not lost we're not ashamed

We are right now

Oh woah oh
No one knows who we are
Oh woah oh
No one gave us a mark [x2]

No one knows who we are
No one gave us a mark [x2]

No one knows who we are
No one knows who we are
No one knows who we are
No one knows who we are---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
