Wake up, so much you and I can be
Far beyond, a place we can see
Listen to the silent prayer as it [praises you]
so could escape

So we step one two, and
know the rhythm now,
step one two,
let the music seep in
step one two,
move with me, there's nothing to it
so c'mon
so c'mon
so c'mon

Come on, you and I will be in love
So in love, so helpless, so new
knowing we will ever see,
the world is honesty
and feel the love [the love]
and feel the love [the love]

So we step one two, and
know the rhythm now
step one two,
let the music seep in
step one two,
move with me, there's nothing to it

So we step one two, and
know the rhythm now
step one two,
let the music seep in
step one two,
move with me, there's nothing to it

So we step one two, and
know the rhythm now
step one two,
let the music seep in
step one two,
move with me, there's nothing to it
So c'mon [fade]---Lyrics submitted by Skripi.
