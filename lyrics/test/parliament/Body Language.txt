Ohh, you can shake it to the east
You can shake it to the west
You can shake it the way that express you the best
But remember, when actions is overheard
One picture is worth a thousand words

Body language
And I heard that

Body language
Talkin' ain't sayin' a word
Picture ain't gettin' it heard
Body language

Talk to me

Just when you find you'd lend an ear
You find it took your eyes to make it clear
What it is her mouth was trying to say
Ohhh, when the words got in the way

Talk to me
