I'll close your eyes 
I'll try to find you 
Into the light 
I'll be behind you 

It's just a touch 
It may not be the answer 
It's all you've got 
And I may not be too tender 

Just this one time around 
Let this love be all you live for 
Just this one time around 
Let this love be all you breathe for 

Ah ah ah ah ah 

I'll hold you in 
I'll bring you closer 
Let it begin 
I'll take you over 

Come stay with me 
Listen to the quiet 
Tell me what you see 
And I'll try to hide it 

[chorus]

I wanna be here now 
I wanna be seen 
I want to go where I've never been 
We might be lost here 
We might be found 
But I need this to happen 
One Time around 

Close your eyes 
I'll make you wonder 
oooh what's inside 
Let me pull you Under
