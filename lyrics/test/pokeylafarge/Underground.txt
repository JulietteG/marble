A hurricane is brewing in the East
While forest fires rage in the West
But when the New Madrid Line, breaks our poor spine
Thats it, there isnt anymore

Tornadoes twisting in the South
While a blizzard blows down from the North
When them old tectonic plates, set off that big earthquake
Cities will crumble from shore to shore

So get ready, get ready
Listen everybody, cant you hear that sound?
From the underground, cant you hear that sound
From the underground, cant you hear that sound

The end wont come from disease
And it wont be from any nuclear bomb
The ground beneath our feet, will rise up to meet
The fire in the sky, becoming one

If there is a God, hes of the land
And he does not favor any man
Father Time has the final say, but it doesnt matter anyway
Mother Nature has made a deal and now its done

From the underground, cant you hear that sound, cant you hear that sound
From the underground, cant you hear that sound, comin up from the underground---
