Where have all the good girls gone?
Was there ever one?
They will win you with their eyes
Then trap you in their thighs
Stay away from love, stay away, boys
Far away, far away, far away
Far away, far away, far away

As the lights of home draw near
Theres a black cat at my door
And he spoke to me
In a manner low and mean
She aint here, she aint here, she aint here, oh no
Far away, far away, far away
Far away, far away, far away

Mother and my sisters three
Forgive these words I speak
For all them pretty, pretty girls
With their lips and their curls
Have robbed my pride from me, dear mom
Far away, far away, far away
Far away, far away, far away

Where have all the good girls gone?
Was there ever one?
They will win you with their eyes
Then theyll trap you in their thighs
Stay away from love, stay away, boys
Far away, far away, far away
Far away, far away, far away---
