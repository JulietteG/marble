Somethings wrong honey, this I know
Never seen you this way before
Hey baby, I wanna be your man
I can tell you need a friend
Step aside, wont you let me in
Hey baby, who do you think I am?

Its late and its bout to pour
Your neighbors tired of me hanging round your door
Ill say one thing and nothing more
I wanna be your man

Some people dont like me hanging around
But theres no reason for that Ive found
Hey baby, please dont look so sad
When youre all alone and you need a hand
Let me come into your house and be your handyman
Hey baby, what about the fun weve had?

I can tell youve had a long day
Why dont we smoke something, take the pain away
Its okay, Ill be your shelter from the storm
Dont let your demons take control
Let me rock you with a steady roll
Its cold, baby, wont you come and keep me warm?---
