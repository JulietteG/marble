All out of pieces, all out of parts
All out of moves, all out of cards
All out of reason, all out of hope
All out of seasons, all out of growth
All out of joy, all out of sun
All out of laughter, all out of fun

I'm running out of the things that protect my heart
From this side of hurt I can see that I'm broken apart
Leaving and telling me I could use some work
I thought I would die cause of how much it hurts
But I'm thanking you, I'm thanking you
Finding all the answers in every tear I cry
I ain't right for nobody if I ain't already right
So I'm thanking you, I'm thanking you woaah
ohhh woahh ohhh no

All out of rope, all out of chances
All out of songs, all out of dances
All out of umbrella, shelter for the rain
Been lost these days, been feelin' this pain
I gave you less, I thought I had more
Forgot all those pieces back there on the floor

I'm running out of the things that protect my heart
From this side of hurt I can see that I'm broken apart

Leaving and telling me I could use some work
I thought I would die cause of how much it hurts
But I'm thanking you, I'm thanking you
Finding all the answers in every tear I cry
I ain't right for nobody if I ain't already right
So I'm thanking you, I'm thanking you woaah

Leaving and telling me I could use some work
I thought I would die cause of how much it hurts
