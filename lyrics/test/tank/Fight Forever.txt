Tank- Fight Forever
I would rather fight with you
I would rather fight with you 
tears fall, hearts break
but thats ok 
through.........
im here to stay

Cause i dont wanna let you go
I dont wanna be alone
we done been there before
but i can take a little more
i would rather fight with ya fight with ya
then not spend another night with ya night with ya
long as we stay together together
we gone fight forever ever ever ever

healing fixing everything we broke
forgiving forgetting so we can move on
its so easy to give up on love 
cause it hurts you and its worth to
but i feel something special in us
we can get through let me show you
believe in us and we gon make it
i need your trust and it wont ever matter what 
comes our way im standing here telling you today

Cause i dont wanna let you go
I dont wanna be alone
we done been there before
but i can take a little more
i would rather fight with ya fight with ya
then not spend another night with ya night with ya
long as we stay together together
we gone fight forever ever ever ever

Promise you wont ever give up
even if you break up make up
Promise you gon give it time to grow
 and build a mountain high
you know what you gotta do 
what its gonna take
for them to see the truth
you gotta keep the faith and youll never lose
real love
tell em yeah... 

I dont wanna let you go
I dont wanna be alone
we done been there before
but i can take a little more
i would rather fight with ya fight with ya
then not spend another night with ya night with ya
long as we stay together together
we gone fight forever ever ever ever

I dont wanna let you go
I dont wanna be alone
we done been there before
but i can take a little more
i would rather fight with ya fight with ya
then not spend another night with ya night with ya
long as we stay together together
we gone fight forever ever ever ever---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Lena.
