You're a freak
And I know it
You're a freak
And you show it
You're a freak
And they told me
They told me was a freak
You're a freak
With a man
You're a freak
With your hands
You're a freak
With a plan
They told me
You was a freak
You're a freak
On the phone
You're a freak
All alone
You're a freak
And they told told me
You was a freak
You're a freak
And I like
You're a freak
And I might fall in love
With a freak
If you can feel me
CHORUS:
She's my freak
You don't have to
Like my freak
'Cause she's a super freak
And now she freaks for me

Repeat chorus thrice

You've been around
And I know it
You've been around
And you show it
You've been around
And told me, told me
You was a freak
From the way
That you shake it
From the way
That you take it
And I know
You ain't fakin' it
This is what they told me
'Cause you can't make
A h*e a housewife
So how can I become a man
And I've been a dog
All my life
If I can change (well)
Then she can change (well)
'Cause we both the same (well)
'Cause if she's a freak
I'm a freak and she

Repeat chorus four times

If you can feel me
I just needed me a freak
To make me say
"Whoo" in the midnight hour
I need some, somebody
To make me say
"Whoo, whoo, whoo"
Oh lay me down
Flip my mind inside out
Make me say
"Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo"
Make me say
"Whoo"
Break it way down
'Cause she's my freak
She my, she's my freak
Ooh

Repeat chorus four times

Ooh we gon' do it
All the freaks is gettin' down
(You know we like dem freaks)
All the freaks is gettin' around
You know we like dem freaks
Y'all gon' take a few
Do what we gotta do
For dem freaks
We want a freak in our life
Like around 2G
Gettin' real freaky---Lyrics submitted by Renee.
