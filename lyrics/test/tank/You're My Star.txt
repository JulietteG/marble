Hey loose girl
You're my brightest possession ever known
I would rather die than let you go girl
Can't describe this feeling in my soul
And I can't help but stare you got that glow
Lemme get a little bit closer
I really wanna be Mr. Your love
Feeling up, I'm feeling so good

You're my star
It's hysteric, I just found my star
I'm so infatuated, who you were?
My star, my star, my star
I probably go to far
Only you are my star

I get chills, every time I think about your smile
My heart skips a beat, I'm thinking 'bout it all
Can I be a fool? Adore when you're around
You started getting on in my world
I love

Lemme get a little bit closer
I really wanna be Mr. Your love
Feeling up, I'm feeling so good

You're my star
It's hysteric, I just found my star
I'm so infatuated, who you were?
My star, my star, my star
I probably go to far
Only you are my star

Only need you, (Need you)
Got curves like the moon (Moon, moon)
But you're hotter than the sun
Baby girl, you're my world
I only need you, my personal bu
But you're hotter than the sun
Baby, you're my one ---
