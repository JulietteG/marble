Go ahead as you waste
your days with thinking
when you fall everyone
              stands
another day and you've
had you're fill of sinking

with the life held in
           you're
hands are shaking cold
theses hands are meant 
            to hold

speak to me,when all you
got to keep is strong
move along,move along
    like i know you do
and even when you're hope
                is gone

move along move 
along just to make
      it through 
     move along
     move along

so a day when you lost
your day completely
could be a night when
your life ends
such a heart that will
lead you to deceiving

all the pain held in your
hands are shaking cold
your hands are mine to hold

speak to me when all you
got to keep is strong
move along move along
like i know you do
and even when your hope 
is gone 

when everything is wrong
we move along
(Go on,go on,go on,go on)
when everything is wrong
we move along
Along,Along,Along,Along,

when all you got to keep is 
strong
move along move along like i 
know you do
and even when your hope is 
gone
move along move along just to 
make it through

when all you got to keep is 
strong
move along move along like i
know you do 
and even when your hope is 
gone
move along move along just to
make it through

(go on go on go on go on)
right back what is wrong
WE move along

(go on go on go on go on)
right back what is wrong 
we move along

(go on go on go on go on)
right back what is wrong 
we move along

(go on go on go on go on)
right back what is wrong
we move along---Lyrics submitted by Ariel Stanfield.
