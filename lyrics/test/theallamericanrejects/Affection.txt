I always wonder where you are
I'm right beside you, you're so far away
Moments you're not facing me
Moments you're not chasing me
I don't believe in good good-byes
Cause even when the roses die
There's still some thorns left in your side
It's like a funeral for the bride
And I know candy girls, yeah they just wrapped your tears
I've always been such a sucker for sweets

I need affection
All I want right now is affection
I don't mean to point your direction
Girl it's not what you do
What you don't do makes me talk to you about affection
I need affection

Somewhere along is when I died
On the banks of some canal
Yeah the river bed of tears I tried to ride
Even fools will believe in lies
And if every word you said were true
You'd be my god and I'd just pray to you for affection

All I want right now is affection
I don't mean to make a confession
Girl it's not what you do
What you don't do makes a man come unglued
Affection, I need affection

Why won't you dance with me
(Covered in gas you couldn't catch fire)
There's no more romance with me
(I know there's someone else burning in your eyes)
You don't think I see you
But I see right through you

Affection
All I want, someone's affection
All I need to, was affection
What ya do (what ya do)
What ya do (what ya do)
Where'd ya go
Affection
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And don't think I see you
I see right through you
You don't think I see you
But I do---Lyrics submitted by nowanadzieja95@gmail.
