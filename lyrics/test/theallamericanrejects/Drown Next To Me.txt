Down down down into a cloud of shame
You love me like a car wreck, wrapped around a tree
Down down down, its the only way to go
Sometimes it's hard to hold on, without letting go

I walk in the water 'cause I can hardly breathe
We can leave the ones who love us
Youre all I ever need
Just sand in the water
Drown next to me

Now, now, now, cause the curtain has to close
We take a bow and face the crowd, realize were all in the show
Now just now you can rest your weary eyes
Its only over once you leave before it makes you feel dead alive

I walk in the water 'cause I can hardly breathe
We can leave the ones who love us
Youre all I ever need
Well tell each other lies
That I know well both believe
Just sand in the water
Drown next to me

Im never letting go
Caught in the undertow
Take your run up and sow
Dive down 'cause I just wanna try to last both out

I walk in the water 'cause I can hardly breathe
We can leave the ones who love us
Youre all I ever need
Well tell each other lies
That I know well both believe
Just sand in the water
Just sand in the water
Just stand in the water
Drown next to me---Lyrics submitted by Lexi Jasa.
