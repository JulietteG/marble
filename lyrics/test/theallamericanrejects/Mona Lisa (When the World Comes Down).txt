Heres another pity, theres another chance
Try to learn a lesson but you cant
If we can burn a city in futures and in pasts
A vow to change our lives will never last
Cause were goin fast

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesnt matter then just turn around
Well donate our bags and we can just leave town
You can sit beside me when the world comes down

What can we do better? When will we know how?
A man says from a sidewalk to a crowd
If we can change the weather, if you want it to yourself
Well if you cant I guess we all need help
Yeah I need help

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesnt matter then just turn around
Well donate our bags and we can just leave town
You can sit beside me when the world comes down

We say, yeah we do, overlies the truth
And all I need is next to me

Yeah were goin fast

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesnt matter then just turn around
Will you be the queen and Ill be your clown?
You can sit beside me when the world comes down

Mmmm mmmm mmmm 

You can sit beside me when the world comes
You can sit beside me when the world comes down---
