Say the Words i can not say,
say them on another day
fragile words like these will cut your tongue.

Was I good enough, was I bad enough?
When I wanted more, yeah,
you had enough.

But nobody's gonna try for you, 
nobody's gonna do like I for you.

And every slow lit cigarette
that nervous hands can barely get the courage
I could always feel your eyes

And those dresses you made look like gowns
You're a sinner but the devil even turned you down.

Cause, nobody's gonna try for you,
nobody's gonna do like I for you.

And, nobody's gonna try for you,
and nobody's gonna lie for you,
nobody's gonna do like I for you.

Hold me like you never could,
I'll hold you like I said I would.

Air or light won't breathe nor shine between.
With your feather lips, yeah, you'll fly away
well, I hope they come back down someday.

Cause, nobody's gonna try for you,
nobody's gonna do like I for you.

Somebody's getting by for you.
I don't bend, I just break in two.

Somebody like me.
I'd die for you.---Lyrics submitted by Lexi Jasa.
