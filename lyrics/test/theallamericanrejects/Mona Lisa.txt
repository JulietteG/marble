Here's another pity
And there's another chance
Try to learn a lesson but you can't
If we can burn a city in futures and in past
Without a change our lives will never last
Cause we're going fast

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesnt matter then just turn around
We don't need our bags
And we can just leave town
You can sit beside me when the world comes down

What can we do better
When will we know how
A man says from a sidewalk to a crowd
If we can change the weather
If you wanted it yourself
If you can't i guess we all need help
I need help

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter then just turn around
We dont need our bags
And we can just leave town 
You can sit beside me when the world comes down

We say
We do
The lies 
The truth
And all i need is next to me

We're going fast

You can sit beside me when the world comes down
If it doesn't matter then just turn around
You be the queen and i'll be your clown
You can sit beside me when the world comes down
You can sit beside me when the world comes 
You can sit beside me when the world comes down---Lyrics submitted by Beth.
