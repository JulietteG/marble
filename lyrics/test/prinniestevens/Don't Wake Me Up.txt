Standing at the edge of the dancefloor
Scared to make my move
Got my black heels on
Got my sights locked on you
I'm feeling two feet tall
Everytime you look my way
And I don't know what's in this drink
But I feel it's starting to take

Don't wake me up
Leave me in this dream
Don't stop
I just wanna sleep
Forever in your arms
Forever in your arms
Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Just wanna sleep
Forever in your arms
Forever in your arms

Now I know it's getting late
But please don't look at the clock
And they're turning up the lights
But I don't want it to stop
And all my friends think I'm crazy
Takin' a stranger home
But I can see it in your eyes
That you're someone I want to know

Don't wake me up
Leave me in this dream
Don't stop
I just wanna sleep
Forever in your arms
Forever in your arms
Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Just wanna sleep
Forever in your arms
Forever in your arms

Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Just wanna sleep
Forever in your arms
Forever in your arms

Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Up Up Up
Up Up Up
Up Up Up
Don't wake me up
Don't turn on the light
Don't take me home
Don't open my eyes
Don't wake me up
Don'et look at the clock
Don't sound the alarm
Don't wanna stop
Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Just wanna sleep
Forever in your arms
Forever in your arms

Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Up Up Up
Just wanna sleep
Forever in your arms
Forever in your arms
Don't wake me up---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
