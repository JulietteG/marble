In your mind you have abilities you know 
to telepath messages through the vast unknown. 
Please close your eyes and concentrate 
with every thought you think 
upon the recitation we're about to sing: 

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft. 
Calling occupants of interplanetary, most extraordinary craft. 

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft; 
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft; 
Calling occupants of interplanetary, most extraordinary craft. 

You've been observing our earth 
and we'd like to make a contact with you. 

We are your friends! 

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft. 
Calling occupants and interplanetary ultra-emissaries. 

We've been observing your earth 
and one night we'll make a contact with you 

We are your friends! 

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft. 
Calling occupants of interplanetary, quite extraordinary craft. 

Please come in peace we beseech you. 
- Only a landing will teach them! - 
Our earth may never survive, 
so do come we beg you. 
Please interstellar policemen. 
Won't you give us a sign (give us a sign) 
that we've reached you? 

With your mind you have ability to form. 
And transmit thought energy far beyond the norm. 
You close your eyes, 
you concentrate 
together - that's the way 
to send the message: 
We declare World Contact Day 

Calling occupants of interplanetary craft; 
Calling occupants of interplanetary craft; 
Calling occupants of interplanetary, most extraordinary craft. 

Ahhh 

Calling occupants; 
Calling occupants; 
Calling occupants; 
Calling occupants; 
Calling occupants of interplanetary, most extraordinary craft---Lyrics submitted by Martina.
