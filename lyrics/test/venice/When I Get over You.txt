Hell will freeze
Love will grow on trees
And the rivers all will run dry
The birds won't sing
And the bells won't ring
There will be no stars in the sky

The truth will be untrue
One and one will not be two
And I'll do something I'll never do
When I get over you

The moon won't glow
And the wind won't blow
There will be no lesson to learn
Life will be too long
Right will be all wrong
And this world will no longer turn

(Chorus)

The blues will not be blue
When I get over you---Lyrics submitted by menno.
