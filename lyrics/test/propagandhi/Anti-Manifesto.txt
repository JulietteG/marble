Dance and laugh and play
Ignore the message we convey
It seems we're only here to entertain
A rebellion cut-to-fit
Well I refuse to be the soundtrack to it
We entertain, we're still knee-deep in shit

But there's something wrong inside
We've played it safe, enjoyed the ride
You won't like this, but I have something to confide
We stand for something more
Than a faded sticker on a skateboard

Rain on your parade we're out the door
And I don't even care any-fucking-more

Witness this pair in accomplice
Witness this pair lethargic, unconcious
No brows furrows in question
Complacent, completing their tasks
No questions asked

Consider this critic a cretin
Resting on laurels, completely invented
Word acrobatics, performed with both harness and net
They're so full of shit

But I will remain 'til this self-awareness fade
'Til I defeat the purpose of this soapbox that you've made
That you've made

Hope, perseverance, some vision - some doubt
Some Greek ink, a 2-6, a bad case of big mouth
The sum of our parts and I've never laughed harder 
The song in our hearts and I've never ;aughed harder
It doesn;t really matter
'Cause nothing's ever felt as right as this---Lyrics submitted by M.
