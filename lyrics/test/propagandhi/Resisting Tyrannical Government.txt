Why don't we all strap bombs to our chests and ride our bikes to the next G7 picnic?
It seems easier with every click tick
But whose will would that represent?
Mine? Yours? The rank and file?
Or better yet The govenments?

But I don't want to catalyze or synthesize the second final solutions
don't wanna be the Steve Smith of the revolution
Do you see the analogy, we're the oilers
and the World bank, the flames
Just 2 minutes remain in the 7th game of this best-of-seven series
Jesus saves, Gretzky soces
The workers slave, the rich get more
One wrong move you risk the cup
Play the man, not the puck

Why don't we plant a mechanic virus And erase the memory of machines that maintain this capitalist dynasty?
And yes I recognise the irony
The system I oppose affords my luxury
I'm biting the hand that feeds
That's exactly why priviledged punks like me
Should feel obliged to whine and kick and scream
'Til everyone has everything thing they need---Lyrics submitted by M.
