[Verse 1:]
So I woke up this morinin and as I start yawnin
Dat milk milk pourin into ma bowl then I though
To myself (thought thought 2 myself) that I need to
Take a trip to the grociery store cause the bread is low and
The chicken I was eatin with the mash potatoes need (a little bit
Of gold) opps wrong song lyric man a little bit of pepper steped
Out the crib with the bear claw slippers robe tighed tight chest
No chest hair store close at 4 so I gotta get there cause it's like 3:50 and
I'm just wakin up and it take 5 minutes just to get to the front now
I'm standin in long lines lady with the baby probably buyin some
Dog food, dog probably crazy on the daily basis ma dayz be like
This cause I got to the register and then the store closed

[Chorus:]
Yo what up man if you u cool what u do warm it up then
I can't hold it cause it's hot put it down then. I left ma kids at
Day care pick em up then I'm tryna but some new shit what you
Tryna spend all I got 5 dollars so u broke man I thought I had
10 dollars so you broke then tv dinner on the counter warm
It up then, warm it up man, warm it up then

[Verse 2:]
Come get some you little bums I got alot and you can't get
None that ice cream truck just left if you run you can catch
But it's out cause I got the last one but I got a box of combs that
I'm willin 2 sell I'll sell the ice cream too 2 scoops 4 a bill I could
Build a sand castle without bringin a pale and go cat fish fishin
And come up with a whale but but you know what that was easy
As hell well maybe not the line about me catchin a whale but if I
Did it then it's nothin then I did it as well probably easy as it is to
Move slow for a snail did you know I made this beat with my mouth
And a bell just a f.y.I I'm f.l.y and for those who can't spell I'm a
Pretty swell guy I cought alot of fish I think I have a fish fry.

[Chorus:]
Yo what up man if you u cool what u do warm it up then
I can't hold it cause it's hot put it down then. I left ma kids at
Day care pick em up then I'm tryna but some new shit what you
Tryna spend all I got 5 dollars so u broke man I thought I had
10 dollars so you broke then tv dinner on the counter warm
It up then, warm it up man, warm it up then---Lyrics submitted by austin.
