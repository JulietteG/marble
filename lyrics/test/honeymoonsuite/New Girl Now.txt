Hot summer night
Storm lies in the air
My eyes are a little heavy
I'm feeling in the past tense
I'm hardly aware

I don't want you on the phone
don't you play that good girl with me
Why must I always say it again

I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
And she's a lot like you

I tried to wash my face
But my head fell to low
I tried to bury myself
But my mind wouldn't stay at home

I don't care if you're sitting at home
somebody has broken into me
Why must I always say it again

I got a new girl now
I got a new girl now
I got a new girl now
And she's a lot like you

I don't want you on the phone
don't you play good girl with me
Why must I always say it again

I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
I've got a new girl now
And she's a lot like you---Lyrics submitted by Barkay.
