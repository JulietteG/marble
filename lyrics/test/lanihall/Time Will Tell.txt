Will this moment, last, past morning
Will the pieces gel
And is that ticking clock, a warning
Time Will Tell

Did I feel it 
Did you fake it
Can we break this shell
Can two people ever make it
Time will tell

Just hold me
While I hold you 
Don't let questions, break this spell
You're here now and you're mine now
And for us now, all is well

Doubting hearts can get too clever
oh love me now while we're together
If its meant to last forever
Time will tell

Just hold me
While I hold you 
Don't let questions, break this spell
You're here now and you're mine now
And for us now, all is well---Lyrics submitted by Brian Larsen.
