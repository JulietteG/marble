the earth can shake the sky come down 
the mountains all fall to the ground 
but i will fear none of these things 
shelter me lord underneath your wings 

dark waters rise and thunder pounds 
the wheels of war are going round 
and all the walls are crumbling 
shelter me lord underneath your wings 
shelter me lord underneath your wings

hide me underneath your wings 
hide me deep inside your heart 
in your refuge - cover me 
the world can shake 
but lord i'm making you my hiding place 

the wind can blow the rain can pour 
the deluge breaks the tempest roars 
but in the storm my spirit sing 
oh shelter me lord underneath your wing
shelter me lord underneath your wing

hide me underneath your wings
hide me deep inside your heart 
in your refuge - cover me 
the world can shake 
but lord i'm making you my hiding place 

now on the day you call for me 
someday when time - no more shall be 
i'll say death where is your sting 
shelter me lord underneath your wing
shelter me lord underneath your wing

hide me underneath your wings
hide me deep inside your heart 
in your refuge - cover me 
the world can shake 
but lord i'm making you my hiding place 

now on the day you call for me 
someday when time - no more shall be 
i'll say oh death where is your sting 
oh shelter me lord underneath your wings
i say shelter me lord underneath your wing
shelter me lord underneath your wing---Lyrics submitted by jimmy.
