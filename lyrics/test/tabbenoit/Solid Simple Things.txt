My baby dont have to try
Lord to turn me on
I know that shes the one
Who could love me till the break of dawn

I want to feel her in my arms
As I fall asleep tonight
Just a solid simple thing
Like her touch can bring me comfort through the night

(Solo)

Now she dont have to speak
But I know just what she means
Cause she never asks me
For more than the simple things

And now were building a home
And were making it strong
Just a solid simple thing
Like our love is what were building it on

(Solo)

Now she dont have to speak
But I know just what she means
Cause she never asks me
Lord for more than the simple things

And now were building a home
And were making it strong
Just a solid simple thing
Like our love is what were building it on

Hey just a solid simple thing
Like our love is what were building it on ---
