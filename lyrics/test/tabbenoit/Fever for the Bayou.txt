Got the fever for the bayou, Muddy Waters take me home.
Got the fever for the bayou, Muddy Waters take me home.
I get high up on the mountains, but I know where I belong.

Down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico.
Down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico.
A Where I find my Cajun babe, and I dance a zydeco.

Wants to take me to the Mardi Gras, just south of New Orleans.
Take me down to the Mardi Gras, in south of New Orleans.
A to the Louisiana Bayou, that's a Cajun man's dream.

Got the fever for the bayou, Muddy Waters take me home.
Got the fever for the bayou, Muddy Waters take me home.
I get high up on the mountains, but I know where I belong.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
