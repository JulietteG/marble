I'm walkin' slow
With a weary mind
She's draggin' me low
I'm fallin' behind

You got me where you want me
Still I keep on tryin'
Tryin' to see through the darkness
Between you and I

Sometimes it gets hard to find
Any love of any kind
Lord turn on the love light
Before I go blind

And pick me up off the ground
Let's let our hearts shine
Shine our way through the darkness
Between you and I

You know I love you
But I did you wrong
And we both made our choices
Now it's time to move on

So please, please forgive me
And let's walk side by side
And fill in this darkness
Between you and I---
