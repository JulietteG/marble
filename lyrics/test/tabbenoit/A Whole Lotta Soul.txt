What's the matter with the place we live in?
Did Mother Nature get it wrong?
A rusted delta in the name of changing
And dig it till it's dead and gone

Oh, what you gonna tell the children
What you gonna tell the trees
What you gonna tell the spirit
When the heart of the bayou bleed?

Well, there's a whole lotta something around here
There's been a whole lotta giving around here
We've seen a whole lotta hurting around here
But there's a whole lotta soul around here

Listen

Maybe we should move the mountains
Maybe we should drain the sea
And wash away the desert
No, that makes no sense to me

But looking it from the outside
It sure don't look that hard
But tell me how you gonna feel
When I come digging up your backyard?

There's a whole lotta something around here
There's a whole lotta giving around here
We've seen a whole lotta hurting around here
But there's a whole lotta soul around here

There's a whole lotta something around here
And there's a whole lotta giving around here
We've seen a whole lotta hurting around here
But there's a whole lotta soul around here
Come on---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
