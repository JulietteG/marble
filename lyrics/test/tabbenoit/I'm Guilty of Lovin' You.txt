Its over now, its in the past, and we said our goodbyes.
What went wrong, Ill never know,
I guess we had some good times.
You tried to explain it, oh, let me down slow.
How I wish I could change it.
I cant help it, these feelings... just wont let go.

When the night closes in,
and the heartache begins,
just remember, Im only guilty
of loving you...

I wish the rain would go away, from outside my window.
Each passing day reminds me, of how much I miss you.
Since you said you were leaving, 
hmm, Im so empty inside.
I refuse to believe it. If only we could be together again.

When the night closes in,
and the heartache begins,
just remember, Im only guilty
of loving you...

Solo...
When the night closes in,
and the heartache begins,
just remember, Im only guilty
of loving you...  oh, baby.

When the night closes in,
and the heartache, heartache, begins,
just remember, Im only guilty
of loving you... 

Just remember, Im only guilty of loving you....---Lyrics submitted by Zoran.
