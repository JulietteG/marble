m a night train	
Rolling nine hundred mile
Im a night train baby
Rolling nine hundred mile
Cant you hear me coming
Aint stopping until morning light

Keep it burning baby
Got that fuel for my fire
Keep it burning baby
Got that fuel for my fire
You know smokin track thru Memphis
Aint stopping until morning light

Aint no time for trouble
Midnight burning bright
Aint no time for trouble baby
I got my midnight burning bright
Keeping one eye on the crossroad
Aint stopping until morning light

Im a night train
Rolling nine hundred mile
Yes Im a night train 
Rolling nine hundred mile
Cant you hear me coming
Aint stopping until morning light---Lyrics submitted by tonino.
