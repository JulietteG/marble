It's hard to see the fear inside 
As I walk away from you 
And distance overcomes the miles 
As slowly I pull through 
And I cannot reach the world today 
'cause I'm suffering from you 
And the more I think, the more I cry 
As I walk away from you 

[Chorus:] 
I'm two steps away 
From loneliness 
I'm awake 
From the mess we made 
I'm alive 
And I'm feeling incomplete 

I don't understand my life 
Or the version that chose you 
And the warring hearts and winter came 
Now there's nothing left to do 
And I cannot reach the world today 
'cause I'm suffering from two 
And the more I think, the more we die 
As I walk away from you 

[Chorus] 

[Bridge:] 
I'm two steps away 
I'm two steps away 
I'm two steps away 
I'm two steps away 

Two steps away 
Two steps away 
From loneliness 
I'm awake 
From the mess we made 
I'm alive 

Two steps away 
Two steps away 
Two steps away---Lyrics submitted by jossalyn.
