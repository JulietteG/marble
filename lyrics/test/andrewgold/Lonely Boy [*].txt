He was born on a summer day,  1951
And with the slap of a hand he had landed as an only son
His Mother and Father said "What a lovely boy"
We'll teach him what we've learned, oh yes just what we've learned
We'll dress him up warm and we'll send him to school
It'll teach him how to fight, to be nobody's fool

Oh,  oh what a Lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a Lonely boy

In the summer of '53, his Mother brought him a sister
And she told him, We must attend to her needs
She's so much younger than you
Well he ran down the hall and he cried
Oh, how could his parents have lied
When they said he was the only son
He thought he was their only one

Oh,  oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy

Goodbye Momma
Goodbye you
Goodbye Poppa
I'm pushing on though

He left home on a winters day,  1969
And he hoped to find all the love he had lost in that earlier time
Well his sister grew up, and she married a man
She gave him a son, Ah yes, a lovely son
They dressed him up warm and they sent him to school
They taught him how to fight to be nobodys fool

Oh, oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy

Oh, Oh oh,  Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
