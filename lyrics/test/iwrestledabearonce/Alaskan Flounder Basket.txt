I remember business
Before it gets too deep enough
I remember when your walls you walk close
In bitterness, constraint onward
In bitterness, game on... 

Look what you've done
You've gone to play the man again
Look what you've got
A mindless work load
A tasteless dog
Morning wood
A stabing end and your alone... 

I love your... 
Nice surprise
You'll get it one day for yourself
Fuller... 
A nice surprise... 

We bow our heads
Over and over and over again
Off with her head
When will it end?
I'll be seeing your fucking faces soon
Sooner then you know
Night falls to the grace of what we know
Praise all the pretty girls
We'll bide alone
Of what we know
By and by
To the grace of what we know
Needles spin to the drop of flow.---Lyrics submitted by Trae.
