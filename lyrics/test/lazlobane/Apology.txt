Just in case you couldn't tell, 
well i might have been overeacting too
theres enough troubles in this world,
 i don't really wanna wish anymore on you

Now was i wrong, what does it matter?
i'll sing this song, 'till you feel better!
i, just thought i'd apologize, i'll stick a needle in my eyes
i don't really hope you die

And after all that we've been through
i don't know if i'll ever get over you
but we'll move on just the same
2 ex-lovers who really wouldn't mind 1 more
i could be wrong,what does it matter?
so here's this song, do you feel better?
i, just thought i'd apologize, i'll stick a needle in my eyes
don't really hope you die

And i don't know
if you don't care
you took our love beyond repair
cause i don't know if you really ever think that i know that it matters
i know that we'll never be togther does that make you feel better?
i, just thought i'd apologize, i'll stick a needle in my eyes
i, just thought i'd apologize....---Lyrics submitted by Hades TheMighty.
