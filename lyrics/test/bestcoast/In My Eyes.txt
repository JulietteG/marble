I wake up alone
I look at the phone
There's no one there
I look to the sun
Know I can't run
From my cares

I talk to you all the time
Go out of my mind
You say you care but then you act so unaware
I treated you badly
We ended so sadly
Wish I didn't care

What hurts the most is that you're gone
And it hasn't even been that long
But you're in my eyes
You're in my eyes

I sit around
I watch TV
You ignore me

I face the fact that you're not ever coming back
I treated you badly
We ended so sadly
Wish I didn't care

What hurts the most is that you're gone
And it hasn't even been that long
But you're in my eyes
You're in my eyes

What hurts the most is that it's done
And I don't remember having fun
But you're in my eyes
You're in my eyes
I thought that you would always be there
I thought that we could never compare
But the world, the world, the world got in the way

What hurts the most is that you're gone
And it hasn't even been that long
But you're in my eyes
You're in my eyes

What hurts the most is that it's done
I don't remember having fun
But you're in my eyes
You're in my eyes---
