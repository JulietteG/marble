Throwing money in the air like I don't really care
Standing on the chair like I don't really care
Got bitches by the pair, I'm baller of the year
And haters everywhere but, I don't really care

[Hook 2: Trey Songz]
No I don't, I don't, I don't (I don't really care)
No I don't, I don't, I don't (I don't really care)
Got bitches by the pair, I'm baller of the year
And haters everywhere but, I don't really care

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Waka Flocka, I keep them bad bitches yelling it
Thugged out rich as hell plus I'm throwing dick
Drunk as shit
Everywhere I go I'm yelling "Bricksquad Monopoly" loud as shit
Throwing money in the air, fuck it I don't care
50 for the earrings, that's 100 for a pair
Versace on my ass two bands for my underwear
Foreign cars, foreign broads, baller of the year
Sparkles on my champagne independence day
I ain't really want your number, your friend look better anyway

[Hook 1 & 2: Trey Songz]

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Gotta stop, hold up too much money to fold up
Keep some green to roll up, I run it like a motor
You see the way I pull up, attention like a soldier
What you expect to happen now I'm swagging on the sofa
I be so reckless, spend a hundred thou on my necklace
That mean my shit is colder, my neck froze: polar
Bear nigga yeah, baller of the year
And we can take it there, nigga, I ain't never scared

[Bridge x2: Waka Flocka Flame]

Mean mug them back yellin out I'm gettin cake

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
10,000 worth of ones on the way, he ain't playing with
A check lil' mama he just flexing, she came with you
She left with me, uhhh, interception
He saying he gon' kill me when he catch me but, I don't really care
