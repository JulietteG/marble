You talking money I got that, his new bitch my old hoe
They say dont buy clothes, got a diamond grill came to gold
Wanna pop shit, its a drumroll, extendos, nigga case closed
Assist the bully like rondo, sit the 4 thousand rollie, hello
Got a bad bitch, every state I go, million dollar nigga at the corner store

Doe, with boe, bsm so we ok,
Dont be on bs might beat off brake
Then I dip like I be on skates
Just be on g shit dont be on dates
Throw out racks, you might throw out chains
Blow our backs you might know my dames
They dont know yall tracks, they just know yall lame, work
Let me do my thing, couldnt tie my shoes,
Couldnt do my strengths, nigga please, you cold
Blue out flame, and cool, the bull
Dreads outlonger the badge on 
Blowing so much my lungs will due

Uhh, warrup brick squad, never sold work, but I gets off
Sick boss, bout big carsnigga pimp hard

Tight wrist glow, when they get in the dark
Got your lady hard while I lay you flock
And I cut hoes like a tipjab, whoa

Thats when I got me a new car, to go along with my new house
To go along with my new chick, that I just hit on my new couch
Them fly calls like yours dawg, its bout time we put the part 2 out
I aint even spend that old money, I was actually thinking about cooling out
I was straying  you would think Im B.o.b
I got Bombay and lemonade, in my vip like I m Charlie
Bad hoes all pas go, but its can I see id?
She showed me her new  and piercings on her tit
That work for me, well certainly
I make it rain, she works for me
Im major pain, she worship me
She say my name and she cursing me
I get no hand to a slow jam
Its like 4 bands in that
She down to be fucking with a real nigga
She know everytime I come around that she with me
