{Small Instrumental Break}

As the moon,
Kindle's the Night.
As the wind,
Kindle's the Night.
As the rain,
Fills every ocean-
And the sun,the earth.
With your heart,
Kindle my heart.

{Instrumental break}

Take my heart,Take my hand
Kindle it with you love
and my heart, cannot be
Kindled without you!
With your heart, 
kindle my heart!
