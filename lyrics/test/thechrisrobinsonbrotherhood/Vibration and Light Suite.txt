Fools suffer gladly in the face of fate
So I'll leave it up to chance
If it's all the same I'll leave the way that I came
Not afraid to join the dance

Tears of worry where a smile has been
Prophecies come to pass
Bathed in secrets washed in sin
A mystery to take to task

(Chorus)
Vibration, love & light
Peace thru your darkest night
Vibrations, light & love
Peace in the valley

Another omen on an angry wind
Another debt to pay
At the end you must know where to begin
Another book another page

Tread lightly through the darkened space
Keep a candle on the path
Do not stop until the morning breaks
Take the cloth out of the bell

(Chorus)
Vibration, love & light
Peace thru your darkest night
Vibrations, light & love
Peace in the valley

Beyond the hills, beyond the dales
Beyond space, arriving there

The time has come my brother, time to weep and moan
The inward exodus from our earthly form
Time to hear the music emitted from the spheres
Time to dance like children on our diamond tears
Set fire to the sails, cut the horses free
Run the ship aground and let what ever be
Find a hole in the wall
One that no one knows it there
Pass on to the other side
Of the great nowhere

To lose your wisdom, to lose your way
Forget the dignity that you traded away
Traded for money, traded for gold
Traded for shadow that you now own---Lyrics submitted by Greg Frasch.
