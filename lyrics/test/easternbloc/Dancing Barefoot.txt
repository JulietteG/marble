She is benediction 
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with he

Here I go and I dont know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be shes taking over me

Im dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes her come on like some heroine

She is sublimation 
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on 
He, the chosen of she

Here I go and I dont know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Till I lose my sense of gravity

Im dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes her come on like some heroine

She is recreation
She intoxicated by thee
She has a slow sensation
When he, is levitating with she

Here I go and I dont know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Till I lose my sense of gravity

Im dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes her come on like some heroine

Oh God I fell for you
Oh God I fell for you
Oh God I fell for you
Oh God I fell for you---Lyrics submitted by Bryan Bjerke.
