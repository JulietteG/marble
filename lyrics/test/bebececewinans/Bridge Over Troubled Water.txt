When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side (I'm on your side)
When times get rough

Yes and friends just cant
can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
And when you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down (lay me down)
Like a bridge over troubled water (Like a bridge over)
I will lay me down

Like a bridge over troubled water
I'll lay me down
