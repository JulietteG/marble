You might not be the chosen one
Still you wait for your time to come
But your faith has taken a tumble
And your pride is shaken and humble now
You must know nothing's set in stone
You must know that you're not alone

You try not to ever hate
But can't help but overcompensate
There's a smile, says everything's rosy
Maybe ten percent, then it's mostly hell
You must know nothing's set in stone
You must know that you're not alone

You dream of another world
Where the guy always gets a girl
But your life is not like the movies
You can shoot your way to hero, should we
Some time for the underdog
We should take some time for the underdog

The calm ones will get it done
And it's the brave that will overcome
Should you listen to your voices
When they lie and give you no more choices
Afraid what you're gonna do
In this phase that you're going through---Lyrics submitted by Elly.
