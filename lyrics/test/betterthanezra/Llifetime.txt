Allie woke up 8AM, Graduation day
Got into a car, crashed along the way

And we arrived late to the wake, stole the urn while they looked away
And drove to the beach 
'cause I knew you'd want it that way

And you were standing
On the hood of the car
Singing out loud
When the sun came up

And I know I wasn't right
But it felt so good
And your mother didn't mind
Like I thought she would
And that R.E.M song was playing in my mind
And three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime
(pause)
Felt like a lifetime
(pause)
And you move like water
Yeeeeeeeah!
I could drown in you
And I fell so deep once
Yeeeeeeeah!
'Till you pulled me through
Ah Aaaaaaa
You would tell me, "No one is allowed to be so proud, they never reach out, when they're giving up"

And I know I wasn't right
But it felt so good
And your mother didn't mind
Like I thought she would
And that R.E.M song was playing in my mind, yeeeah
three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime
(transition to bridge)
Are you sitting in the lights?
Or combing your hair again?
And talking in rhymes?
Are you standing in the lights?

When I got home, heard the phone, your parents had arrived
You know your dad set his jaw, your mom just smiled and sighed

(And you move like water)
But they left soon, and I went to my room
Played that disc that you'd given me
You know I shut my eyes
I swear I could hear the sea

We were standing
On the hood of your car
Singing out loud when the sun came up

And I know I wasn't right,
But it felt so good.
And your mother didn't mind,
Like I thought she would.
And that R.E.M song was playing in my mind, yeeah
Three and a half minutes
Three and a half minutes
Felt like a lifetime---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
