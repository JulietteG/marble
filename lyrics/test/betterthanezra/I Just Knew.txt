When you walk in the noise disappears
Where you begin is perfectly clear
All this time I felt so confused
Then came you and I just knew

Well I fell out when you picked up the phone
When we'd go out, yeah, it'd feel just like home
Do you think that I'm alright
Shining through and I just knew
And I just knew

There's something I've been meaning to ask you
How about making it for real
Something changed but I just knew
And I just knew

There's something I've been meaning to ask you
How about doing it for life
Something changed and I just knew
And I just knew
And I just know
Oh yeah and I knew

Come around and see me tonight, Darlin'
Come around and make it all right
Come around and see me tonight
Come around and make it all right, Darlin' ---Lyrics submitted by rommel setosta.
