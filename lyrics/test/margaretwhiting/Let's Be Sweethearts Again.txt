You forgive me and I'll forgive you
Let's be sweethearts again
If we remember how we started
Then we'll forget the way we parted
You forget this and I'll forget that
Kiss me darling and then
You forgive me and I'll forgive you
And we'll be sweethearts again

You forgive me and I'll forgive you
Let's be sweethearts again
If we remember how we started
Then we'll forget the way we parted
You forget this and I'll forget that
Kiss me darling and then
You forgive me and I'll forgive you
And we'll be sweethearts again

You forgive me and I'll forgive you
Let's be sweethearts again
If we remember how we started
Then we'll forget the way we parted
You forget this and I'll forget that
Kiss me darling and then
You forgive me and I'll forgive you
And we'll be sweethearts again---Lyrics submitted by Breanna.
