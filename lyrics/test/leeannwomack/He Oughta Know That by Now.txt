I guess he's working late again
I don't need to wonder where he is
But I do
He oughta know that by now

I know his job takes a lot of him
There's not much left for him to give
But I need more
He oughta know that by now

It's not like he's gotta read my mind
To know what I'm feeling after all this time
It's just too hard to hold onto what is never around
He oughta know that by now

He used to promise soon things would change
It's been years and it's still the same
And that hurts
He oughta know that by now

I've grown so used to being alone
Couldn't be much worse if I were gone 
And in a way I am
He oughta know that by now

It's not like he's gotta read my mind
To know what I'm feelin' after all this time
It's just too hard to hold onto what is never around
He oughta know that by now

Heartache and coffee at midnight motel
Leavin' him was hard as hell, but I did
He oughta know that by now

I didn't try to explain
No good-bye underneath my ring
That was all I left
He oughta know that by now

That was all I left
And he oughta know that by now---Lyrics submitted by Colbey.
