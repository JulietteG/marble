(chourse)
Make memories with me, make memories with me, forget the one who might have been and the one who use to be.... Darlin' I've got love, and you've got love so love is all we need.... oh-ho baby, make memories with me.

 Let me hold you closer, then you've ever bee held before, let love take us higher than the stars, (man's part) Ask me for forever, I'll give you even more, just let be the keeper of your heart.....
                               ( back to chourse)

(tag)  Darlin I've got love and you've got love,and love is all we need, oh-ho baby, make memories with me. Oh-ho baby , make memories with me.
 Make memories.... with me.....---Lyrics submitted by charlotte.
