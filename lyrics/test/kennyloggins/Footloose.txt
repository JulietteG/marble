I've been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours for what?
Oh, tell me what I got

I've got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling or else I'll tear up this town
Tonight I gotta cut

Now I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get Mack, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
I dig a way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for

Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You can fly if you'd only cut

Loose, footloose kick off your Sunday shoes
Oh please, Marie shake it, shake it for me
oh, Milo c'mon, c'mon let's go
Lose your blues everybody cut footloose

Ohhhhhhhhhh
Cut footloose ohhhhhhhhhh
Cut footloose ohhhhhhhhhh
Cut footloose ohhhhhhhhhh

You got to turn me around
And put your feet on the ground
Now take a hold of your soul
ah.. ah..ah..ahhhhhhhh, I'm turning it loose!

footloose kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise pull me offa my knees
Jack, get back c'mon before we crack
Lose your blues now everybody cut footloose

Loose, footloose kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise pull me offa my knees
Jack, get back c'mon before we crack
Lose your blues

Everybody cut everybody cut
Everybody cut everybody cut
Everybody cut everybody cut
Everybody everybody cut footloose
Cut footloose---
