HELLO I GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
BUT IT'S CRAZY 
I GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU 
SO GIVE ME JUST ONE MORE TIME
ONE MORE GLANCE
AND I WILL MAKE OF YOU ANOTHER BELIEVER
GUESS WHAT?
YOU GOT MORE THAN YOU BARGAINED
AIN'T IT CRAZY?
YOU GOT MORE THAN  YOU PAID FOR
SO GIVE ME JUST ONE MORE TIME
ONE MORE GLANCE
ONE MORE HAND TO HOLD
 YOU'VE BEEN ON MY MIND
THOUGH IT MAY SEEM I'M FOOLING
WASTED SO MUCH TIME
THOUGH IT MAY SEEM I'M FOOLING
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT?
HELLO YOU'VE BEEN ON MY MIND...---Lyrics submitted by Annie.
