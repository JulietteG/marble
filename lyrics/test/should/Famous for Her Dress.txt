famous for her dress was all that she could say
before tearing up
shed turn and hesitate
as if she found the strength
but then it all came out
why did she have to stay?
and if it hadnt rained..she would still be here

she hadnt found the strength quite yet
to lay the past at rest at night
she watched the lights of cars go by
imagining another life

as the green of summer fades
and gives way to the chill
she cant give it up
why did she have to stay?
and if it hadnt rained..she would still be here

she hadnt found the strength quite yet
to lay the past at rest at night
she watched the lights of cars go by
imagining another life---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
