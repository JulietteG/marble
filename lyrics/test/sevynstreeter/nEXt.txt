Together 
Forever, I will never... 
Never, let you go! 
Seem like soon as we say that, 
We at war 
Surrender... 
Some'n we don't know! 

It's something between us, 
Certain fire in our love 
It's unreleasable, unbelievable! 
We're miserable apart, but together it's so hard 
All I need to know, Oh, all I need to know 
How could my ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend? 
My ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend 
How could my ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend? 
I need to know-ow-ow-ooow, ohhh, oh! 

Mmm, 
Every time we break-up 
We turn around and we make up 
Momma wonder when I'm gone wake up 
But he love my face with no make-up, yeah! 
And every time I call'em, we end up having a problem 
And I know we probably never solve it, hmmm 
But damn, I really love him! 

It's something between us,

I need to know-ow-ow-ooooh, knoooow? 

I leave him (leave'em) 
Go back to him (back to'em) 
Then leave him (leave'em), again! (Ahhhhh) 
What we're doing (what we doin'), I wish I knew it (wish I knew it) 
I really don't understand 
He love me (love me), he love me not (love me not) 
What the hell we're doing? 
I need to know, I need to know! 

How could my ex-boyfriend, be my next-boyfriend?
