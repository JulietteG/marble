Dear disillusioned boy,
Who taught you to destroy
Everything that's beautiful
Everything that shines
You're the monster underneath your bed and I'll

I'll give you 1 warning shot, I'll give you 2 warning shots,
I'll give you 3 warning shots to the head

I know you
I give Lucifer his due
He promised you you'd be legit
But everybody thinks you're shit
I hope every dream you dream, you dream in red and I'll

I'll give you 1 warning shot, I'll give you 2 warning shots,
I'll give you 3 warning shots to the head

Yeah you caught Johnny-on-the-spot
But no one gives you a second thought and I'll
I'll give you 3 warning shots to the head

Standing on a New York sidewalk with a loaded gun

Mommies depressed little joy
Holden Caulfield's stable-boy
Hey come on wake up you sleepy head, and I'll give you

I'll give you 1 warning shot, I'll give you 2 warning shots,
I'll give you 3 warning shots to the head

You got empty brain and crazy thoughts
'The voices' had you tied in knots and I'll
I'll give you 3 warning shots to the head---Lyrics submitted by krista.
