Fancy cars and diamond rings
I've seen all kinds of shiny things
I should be feeling alive again
But Lord I don't

Creepy town so full of users
Make a million still a loser
Some may bet on you to win
most hope you won't

Living wild
Ain't no mercy being free
when it brings you to your knees
Can't keep lying

I'm see the road now
I know just what I need
To find my way back to Tennessee

I'm going home now
to southern they're so sweet
and find my way back to Tennessee

I was only seventeen
I left behind my beauty queen
I turned my back on everything and everyone

Rooms with lots of pretty faces
Still don't fill the empty spaces
Wondering where amazing grace
Is there and gone no

Now I know there's no comfort in this world
God I miss that hometown girl
Wanna hold her

I'm on the road now
I know just what I need
To find my way back to Tennessee

I'm coming home now
To southern they're so sweet
And find my way back to Tennessee

Oh

All this time
I was chasing after dreams
It was right in front of me
I was lost without her

I'm on the road now
I know just what I need
To find my way back to Tennessee

I'm coming home now
To southern they're so sweet
And find my way back to you and me
Find my way back to Tennessee---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
