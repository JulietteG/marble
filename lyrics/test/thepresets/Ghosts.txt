Oooo ooo oooooo oooo
Oooo ooo oooooo oooo

Once i was a very young man, and very young man are none to clever
Sailed across to faraway lands
And farway towns of tin an terror
Ran em up in a strip called love
Lost my mind in the streets of neon
Now Im coming on back
Help me up move right, left foot forward
Oh we had a merry old time, but merry old times dont count for nothing
Cocaine, song and women and wine
Memories blur and they make me shudder
Bed in the morning, eight, four, five, couple of days to get my head off

Now Im comming on back
Help me up move right left foot forward
To Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho
(Oooo ooo oooooo oooo)
Im troubled by gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Ghosts in heaven
Oooo ooo oooooo oooo

Far below the shiniest stars, shiniest stars wont shine for ever
Take your soul and you can go far,
If you dont fall from grace of favor
Golder weights are those who star
You can take now and Ill take never

Now Im comming on back
Help me up move right left foot forward
To Gho Gho Gho Gho Ghooo Gho Gho
(Oooo ooo oooooo oooo)
Im troubled by gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Ghosts in heaven
Oooo ooo oooooo oooo
Gho Gho Gho Gho Ghooo Gho Gho
Im troubled by gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Gho Ghosts in heaven
Oooo ooo oooooo oooo
Oooo ooo oooooo oooo

Soon Ill be a very old man, and very old men they dream of summers
Spent with falls in faraway clans
While hometown sings hymns of courage
Ran em up in a strip called love
Lost my mind in the streets of neon
Now Im coming on back home
Help me up move right left foot forward---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
