I see the sparkling little diamond on your hand
It's plain to see that you've already got a man
I can see you're not about to fall for any of my lines
I see the want to in your eyes

Deep in your smile there's a quiet, soft desire
Like the embers of a once raging fire
You know I could light that fire again,
you know it isn't wise
I see the want to in your eyes

How strong's a band of gold
Is it strong enough to hold,
when a love has grown cold
and A woman wants a love, sweet
and warm
How many women just like you have
silent schemes.
How many men like me do they sleep
with in their dreams
You can stay or you can go and
although I sympathize
I still see the want to in your eyes
I see the want to in your eyes---Lyrics submitted by eddie larson.
