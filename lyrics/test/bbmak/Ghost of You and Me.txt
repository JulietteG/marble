What am i supposed to do with all this blues
Haunting me, everywhere, no matter what i do
Watching the candle flicker out in the evening glow
I can't let go, when will this night be over

CHORUS :
I didnt mean to fall in love with you
And baby there's a name for what you put me through
It isn't love it's robbery
I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me

Seen alot of broken hearts go sailing by
Phantom ships lost at sea and one of them is mine
Raising my glass i sing a toast to the midnight sky
I wonder why the stars don't seem to guide me
(Chorus)

The ghost of you and me
When will it set me free
I hear the voices call
Following footsteps down the hall
Trying to save what's left of my heart and soul

Watching the candle flicker out in the evening glow
I can't let go when will this night be over
(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by andi.
