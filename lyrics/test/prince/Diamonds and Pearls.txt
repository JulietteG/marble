This will be the day you will hear me say 
that I will never run away
I am here for you, love is meant for two,
now tell me what you're gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you  be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
All I can do is just offer you my love

Which one of us is right if we always fight
Why cant we just let love decide (let love decide)
Am I the weaker man because I understand 
That love must be the master plan (love is the master plan)

If I gave you diamonds and pearls 
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
All I can do is just offer you my love 

D to the I to the A to the M, 
O to the N to the D to the Peals of love (REPEAT)

There will come a time (there'll come a time)
When you will blow your mind (your mind)
And everything you look for you'll find (take a look inside, yeah)
That will be the time (that'll be the time)
That everything will shine
So bright it makes you colorblind (you will be colorblind)
