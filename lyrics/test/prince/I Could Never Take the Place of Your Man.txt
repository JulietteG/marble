It was only last June 
When her old man ran away 
She couldn't stop crying 
'Cause she knew he was gone to stay 

It was ten thirty-five on a lonely Friday night 
She was standin' by the bar, 
She was lookin' alright, yeah 

I asked if she wanted to dance 
And she said all she wanted was a good man 
And wanted to know 
If I thought I was qualified, yeah 

And I said, baby don't waste your time 
I know what's on your mind 
I may be qualified for a one night stand 
But I could never take the place of your man 

It hurt me so bad when she told me 
With tears in her eyes (tears in her eyes) 
He was all she ever had 
And now she wanted to die 

He left her with a baby 
And another one on the way, yeah 
She couldn't stop cryin' 
'Cause she knew he was gone to stay 

She asked me if we could be friends 
And I said, oh, honey baby that's a dead end 
You know and I know 
That we wouldn't be satisfied 
No 

And I said, baby don't waste your time 
I know what's on your mind 
You wouldn't be satisfied (wouldn't be satisfied) 
With a one night stand (uh, uh, uh) 

And I could never take the place of your man, oh 
Yeah, yeah, the place of your man (uh, uh, uh) 
One, two---
