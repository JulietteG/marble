Bout time, 
We can do is all night

I know you got a young thing
You dont care about me,
Hes darker than quicksand
Hes taller than a tree.
But what you need is some real lovin
Stead of these young ass fools,
I got the butter for you muffin
Just need the keys to the room.

{Hook}
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on Shake it now (come on baby)
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now 

We could freeze in London
You could hear me sing,
And if you wanna make love then
You got to wear my ring.
Cause I dont want no mistress
Much rather be bound,
Lets find a preacher
So we can get down, down, down.

{hook}
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on Shake it now (come on baby)
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now 

Come on (come on)

You and your girlfriend, 
Yall two of a kind.
Just runnin these knuckle heads,
Three and four at a time.
Before they used warm babies
But you still like to wild,
First rule in makin one
You cant be no child.
Instead of hittin that Remy, (hittin that Remy)
Why dont yall hit the door (hit the door),
I focus on the red eye
Well be good to go (good to go).
And if every life has got a reason
You can be mine,
Perfume in the bath darlin
Champagne while we dine.

{hook}
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on Shake it now (come on baby)
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on baby)
Come on ah baby (shake it now)
Come on shake it now (come on, come on)
Come on ah baby (shake it, shake it baby)
Come on shake it now 

Come on
Come on baby
Yeah,  come on

Twenty days in London,
You aint gimme no love.
Could it another brother man,
That your thinkin of?
Or could it be your girlfriend,
Who never ever been straight?
When I ask you are you hungry,
You say you already ate.
You can play me if you wanna,
But you better let me know.
I dont need to play the good licks,
If I aint gonna be no show.
Im better sleepin wit my guitar,
If you aint gonna sing.
Strapped to the body,
Makin love to the stings.

Ooohhh, 
Oohh, ooh , oooh,
Ooohhh, 
Oohh, ooh , oooh,

{hook}
Come on baby 
Come on Shake it now 
Come on baby 
Come on shake it now 
Come on baby 
Come on shake it now 

Gimme, gimme good love
stead of droppin dimes baby
Come on 
We aint gonna make love
You cant do nothing for me(for me)
Gimme, gimme good love
Cant do nothin for me baby (come on)

Come on ah baby 
Come on Shake it now 
Come on ah baby 
Come on shake it now 
Come on ah baby 
Come on shake it now 
Come on ah baby 
I got the butter for your muffin, (whooo)---Lyrics submitted by Terence.
