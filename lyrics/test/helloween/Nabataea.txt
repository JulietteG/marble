Way back in time was a nation sublime
For they had what it takes to lead a good life
Foemen believed it's because of some secrets
They brought the fight and it never ended

Hush, don't cry
Deep in the night come the raiders
Shiver and pray
Petra will fall to the Great

Oh Nabataea
You came so far
Now gone you are
Oh Nabataea
You morning star
Now so afar
Nabataea

People desire and people admire
Some always try to reigh with fire
Soe are the seals, hence the old Nabateans
Have disappeared under the wire

Hush, don't cry
Deep in the night come the raiders
Shiver and pray
Petra will fall to the Great

Oh Nabataea
You came so far
Now gone you are
Oh Nabataea
You morning star
Now so afar
Nabataea

Petra, you were a shinging star
Unique in your time
Petra, 2000 years on we still
Suffer the same crimes
Petra, today we're trying hard
to reach your paradigm

We say no
To the utlra-extreme
No
To the killers of dreams
No
No!

Children, children have no fear
Soon we all will disappear
Children, children don't you cry
Make no sound or we will die

Once there was a land midst of the chaos
Floating like an island in old blood
People lived in peace, there was no hunger
Though they had no slaves, believe it or not
Once there was a nation without soldiers
Never brought a war to other lands
They lived without king or queen or ruler
Once there was the first democracy

Oh Nabataea
You came so far
Now gone you are
Oh Nabataea
You morning star
Now so afar
Oh Nabataea
Oh Nabataea---Lyrics submitted by Raph al Guul.
