Hours of lust, hours of tears passing by before my eyes
Today, tomorrow, yesterday. . .one life
Days of joy, day of sadness come and go to pass me by
A month, a year, one hundred years, they fly

Bridge: ohh, one day I will be gone to lead another life
ohh, and this world will stop to turn around with me
'cause

Chorus: time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally

Times of peace, times of fights, constant movement is our life
Can't stop no more, not until. . .we die
We long for more. . .eternity, and maybe there's another life
This one is short, no matter how you try

Bridge: ohh, but never give up all the hope to lead a good life
no, don't waste your given time to make things worse

Chorus: time. . .marches
time. . .marches
one without us all, never stops, yes
time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on and on and on, flies eternally

Plese, please help me see, the best way to be
Make a change and we, live eternally
No more wasted years, no more wasted tears
Life's too short to cry, long enough to try

Chorus: time. . .marches
time. . .marches
on without us all, never stops, yes
Time. . .marches
Time. . .marches
On and on and on, flies eternally---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
