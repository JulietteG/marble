You were sittin on his tailgate 
She was lovin on his roughneck 
She was talkin bout runnin away 
While he was puffin on a cigarette 
And just thinkin 
How am i gonna say goodbye 

He said girl you got it good here 
You dont need to mess with 
A guy going nowhere 
She said hows about Texas? 
He got up and shook his head 
Then said 
Aint ya been listenin 
Its never gonna work out 
And i think itd be a good time now 
To let me go 

You dont need me baby 
Stop holdin on the way you are 
Dont you know I'm no good for you 
And itll only break your heart 
If you dont let me go 

He said other than a dreamer 
I aint nothing but a drifter 
You could do a lot better 
He leaned over and he kissed her 
He said youd got another year of college 
And a good momma and a daddy 
And me i got 93 dollars and this old 82 Chevy 

So let me go 
You dont need me baby 
Stop holdin on the way you are 
Dont you know I'm no good for you 
And itll only break your heart 
If you dont let me go 

She said nice try 
But you cant hide behind those shades there on your face 
See i dont think youre all that tough 
I just think youre scared of love 
And i think i wont take up that much space 

So let me go 
Take me with ya baby 
Its so cold outside your arms 
And we both know that youre not as strong 
As you think you are 

So let me go take me with ya baby 
I'm alone where you are 
We both know I'm so good for you 
And itll only break ya heart 
Down the road if you dont let me go... 
With ya baby 

Let me go---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
