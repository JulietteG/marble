I knew you wouldn't answer after the things we said that night
You were crying I grabbed the keys and said goodbye
Well hang on please don't hang up let me talk to our machine
I've had all this time to think about what you mean to me

[Chorus]
I know you said it's over but my hearts telling me that ain't right
I know it can't be over 'cause I still wake up reaching for you in the night
It took leaving for me to realize there's good in goodbye

I'm listening to the talking should I pick up the phone
And lay my pride aside and say come home
I've played that moment over time and time again
When giving up seemed easier than just giving in

[Chorus]

I'll try to call you one more time
Baby if you'd just call me one more time

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
