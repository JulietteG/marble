I get 700 channels on my TV
I got more things than any man needs
I've got friends to call when I want to get buzzed
But I can't get you close enough.

There ain't a place that's too far away
Cause I could buy a ticket and leave today
But I can't fix what I messed up
If I can't get you close enough.

So many people in the world to love
Crazy how my heart only wants one
And I can't shake how good it was
Back when we couldn't get close enough.

Yeah my idea of love was wrong
It all made sense when you were gone
I thought I gave you so much
But all you really wanted was close enough.

So many people in the world to love
Crazy how my heart only wants one
And I can't shake how good it was
Back when we couldn't get close enough.

We couldn't get close enough.
We couldn't get close enough.

All you ever wanted was for me to be there
Look in my eyes, know that I care
I could never tell you what you needed too hear
When you were right here.

I can't fix what I messed up
If I can't get you close enough.---Lyrics submitted by Donna Barnes.
