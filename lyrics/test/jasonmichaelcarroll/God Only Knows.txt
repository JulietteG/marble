What was I thinkin'
comin' home at a quarter after three.
With a chip on my shoulder
lettin' whiskey speak for me.
Well you packed your bags and when you looked back
I sat and watched you go
What was I thinkin'?
God only knows

How much I love you
What I'd give for a second chance.
I'd swallow my pride, stay by your side,
never let go again.
And I don't know if you don't come back,
how I'll make it on my own.
What was I thinkin'?
God only knows.

What's on your mind
every time my number's on your phone.
Do you think about the way we were,
and where we went wrong.
When you hear my name
does it feel the same as it did so long ago?
What was I thinkin'?
God only knows.

God only knows
if I lost everything.
God only knows
if you'll come back to me.
God only knows.

What was I thinkin'?
God only knows.
Oh uh ohhh.---
