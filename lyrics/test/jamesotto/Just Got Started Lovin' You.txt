You don't have to go now honey
Call and tell 'em you won't be in today
Baby there ain't nothin' at the office
So important it can't wait
I'm thankful for the weekend
But two days in heaven just ain't gonna do
This is gonna take forever darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you

What's the point in fightin' what we're feelin'
We both know we'll never win
Ain't this what we're missin'
Let's just stop all this resistin' and give in
Let me wrap my arms around you
You know you don't want to leave this room
Come back and let me hold you darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you

What can I say I've never felt this way
Girl you're like a dream come true
After all the love we've made
It sure would be a shame
If we let this moment end so soon

So won't you lay back down beside me
Girl just like I know you're wantin' to
Trust me when I tell you darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you

I'm thankful for the weekend
But two days in heaven just ain't gonna do
This is gonna take forever darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you
Come back and let me hold you darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you ---
