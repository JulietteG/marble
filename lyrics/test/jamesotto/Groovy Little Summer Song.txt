"When the days start gettin' warmer 
And the sun starts sinkin' slower 
Weekends go by faster and beer starts tasting colder 
Wanna tune into a station that takes me on a soul vacation 
Hey there mister DJ, come on wont you please play 

CHORUS: 
One that we can dance to 
Start up a romance to 
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along 
While cruisin' with the top down, crank it up real loud 
A groovy little summer song (Yeah) 

Make me feel the rhythm of warm tropical islands 
Take me to a beach somewhere where everyone is smilin' 
Sippin' margartias and eyein' senoritas 
I can almost see 'em swayin' once ya start playin' 

(Chorus): 
One that we can dance to 
Start up a romance to 
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along 
While cruisin' with the top down, crank it up real loud 
A groovy little summer song (Yeah) 

(Play that guitar now, come on) 

Play something sexy to make her fall in love with me 
Won't you please--- 
play One that we can dance to 
Start up a romance to 
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along 
While cruisin' with the top down, crank it up real loud 
A groovy little summer song (Yeah) 

Play one that we can dance to 
Start up a romance to 
Make it pretty simple so we all can sing along 
While cruisin' with the top down, crank it up real loud 
A groovy little summer song (Yeah) 

My groovy little summer song (mmm) 

(feels like summer time to me) 
(pass me a beer)"---Lyrics submitted by leo.
