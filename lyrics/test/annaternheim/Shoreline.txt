Ever since I was eight or nine
I've been standing on the shoreline
Always waiting 
For something lasting
Loose your hunger, you loose your way
Get confused and you fade away

Oh this town
Kills you when you are young
Oh this town
Kills you when you are young

I'm not the boy I used to be
This town has got the youth of me
All eyes turn hollow
From the work of sorrow
Mmmmmmm
Mmmmmm

Standing on the paving
By the office building
They've got so much to do
Never time for you

We are shadows
Oh we're shadows
Shadows in the alley

You die when you're young
You die when you're young
You die when you're young---Lyrics submitted by ebba.
