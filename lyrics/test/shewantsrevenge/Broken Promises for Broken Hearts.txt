Pay attention my love 'cause its over
At the tip my tounge is the price you weren't willing to pay
Still this is something akin to a breakdown
And your impression of a woman supposed to be easy to see

That there'd be torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing, crying and drawn out fights
Make up, sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts

When you look back now was it special 
Or was is nothing but a anecdote that you can tell now and then?
And i delude myself it was worth it
Even though from the beginning I could see exactly how it would end

That there'd be torn up photos and lonely nights
Cursing crying and drawn out fights
Make up, sex and a brand new start 
Broken promises for broken hearts

Torn up photos and lonely nights 
Cursing, crying and drawn out fights 
Make up, sex and a brand new start
Broken promises for broken hearts

I wanna wish you away 
Wanna wish you away 
Wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away

Wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away
I wanna wish you away

Wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away
Wanna wish you away 
I wanna kiss you away

Torn up photos and lonely nights 
Cursing, crying and drawn out fights 
Make up, sex and a brand new start 
Broken promises for broken hearts---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Ellsworth.
