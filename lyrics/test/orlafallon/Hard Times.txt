let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
while we all sup sorrow with the poor
there's a song that will linger forever in our ears
oh, hard times come again no more

'tis a song a sigh of the weary
hard times hard times come again no more
many days you have lingered around my cabin door
oh hard times come again no more

while we seek mirth and beauty
and music light and gay
there are frail ones fainting at the door
though their voices are silent
their pleading looks will say 
oh, hard times come again no more

'tis a song a sigh of the weary 
hard times... hard times come again no more
many days you have lingered around my cabin door
oh, hard times come again no more

'tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave
'tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
'tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave
oh, hard times come again no more

'tis a songa sigh of the weary
hard times hard times come again no more
many days you have lingered around my cabin door
oh, hard times come again no more
oh, hard times come again no more---Lyrics submitted by David.
