Decembers fingers touch my window
Im looking on toward a windblown night
I feel the sigh of magic
On shadowed wings from the fields of white
And then in the starry night

The Christmas bells ring a silver tune
The angels ring all around the moon
My fire burns by the holly tree
My dream stands there in the flames for me

I see a place where laughter rings
Fears of forgotten pain
This winter world is changed to spring
When the bells of Christmas ring

Somewhere inside the sleeping darkness
Unbroken love in the heart and sky
Below these frozen meadows
An April dawn tell me where is light
It comes in a distant chime 

The Christmas bells ring a silver tune
The angels ring all around the moon
My fire burns by the holly tree
My dream stands there in the flames for me

I see a place where laughter rings
Fears of forgotten pain
This winter world is changed to spring
When the bells of Christmas ring

Sweet sound filling the air
Sweet sounds lifting the cares of the world
I need
Old song gracefully drawn
Old songs calling to all of the world

(music)
Fears of forgotten pain
(music)
When the bells of Christmas ring

The Christmas bells ring a silver tune
The angels ring all around the moon
My fire burns by the holly tree
My dream stands there in the flames for me

I see a place where laughter rings
Fears of forgotten pain
This winter world is changed to spring
When the bells of Christmas ring

The Christmas bells ring a silver tune
The angels ring all around the moon
My fire burns by the holly tree
My dream stands there in the flames for me

I see a place where laughter rings
Fears of forgotten pain
This winter world is changed to spring
When the bells of Christmas ring---Lyrics submitted by Lyn.
