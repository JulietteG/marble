When I'm less than I should be
When I can't face the day
When darkness falls around me
And I just can't find my way

When my eyes don't clearly see
And I stumble through it all
You I lean upon
You keep me strong
And you rise me when I fall

You are there when I most need you
You are there so constantly
You come shining through, you always do
You are always there for me

When life brings me to my knees
When my back's against the wall
You are standing there right with me
Just to keep me standing tall

Though a burden I may be,
You don't weary, you don't rest
You are reaching out to carry me
And I know I'm heaven blessed...

You are there when I most need you
You are there so constantly
You come shining through, you always do
You are always there for me

You are there when I most need you
You are there so constantly
You come shining through, you always do
You are always there for me

You come shining through, you always do
You are always there for me---Lyrics submitted by Adira.
