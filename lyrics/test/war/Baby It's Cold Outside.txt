Since you've been gone baby it's cold outside,
rain in my heart,
tells me it's cold outside,
yea, yea,
when I met you baby,
everything was right,
right on time awww girl, 
and it was beautiful when you were mine,
you were mine,

Since you've been gone baby it's cold outside
tears in my eyes,
tells me it's cold outside
when you kissed me,
your lips were sweet, so sweet, so sweet, sweet as wine,
awww baby, and it was wonderful, when you were mine,

Chorus:
Sure was right when you held me tight,
love with you girl was out of sight,
I know now what I didn't know then,
come back and won't you do it again

Since you've been gone baby it's cold outside,
pain in my head,
tells me it's cold outside,
when you love me,
you make my love life shine,
you made it shine girl,
you were eveything baby,
when you were mine.

 2nd Chorus:
Need some more what I had before,
Played the game now I know the score,
You might dream that I'm singing the blues,
Let me back in cause I paid my dues,
Sure was fine when you were mine,
Loving you girl was right on time,
Wish I knew what I knew I should,
Come back home and we can make it good,
Sure was right when you held me tight,
Love with you girl was out of sight,
I know now what I didn't know then,
Come on back we can do it again.
