You're stranded in the desert
Ain't gonna be no rescue tonight
My telephone is ringing
But me and it are havin' a fight
Don't wanna hear your misery
Talkin' to me in my sleep
Tellin' me your kisses are destiny
When you act like a creep

Stay on the other side
In the universe of crazy lies
There's a whole world waitin' down below
And now you're sinkin' in, in my quicksand
In my quicksand

Don't send a messenger
My lights are on but nobody's home
You could smother it with money
But really, you should leave me alone
For all the days of romancin' me
I am so over it
All these definitions of ecstasy
Is how my fuse got lit

Stay on the other side
In the universe of crazy lies
There's a whole world waitin' down below
And now you're sinkin' in, in my quicksand
In my quicksand

Mmmmmm... Mmmmmmm...
Mmmmmm... Mmmmmmm...
I can see you sinkin' down
Wave goodbye you're going down

Stay on the other side
In the universe of crazy lies
There's a whole world waitin' down below
And now you're sinkin' in, in my quicksand
In my quicksand
In my quicksand
Going down...
Down, down, down
Down mmmmm...
I can see you sinkin'
I can see you sinkin' down---
