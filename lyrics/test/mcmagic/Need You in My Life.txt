I am so in love with you
(Girl I am so in love with you)
Baby I need you by my side
See Im not the one for you
But girl I need you in my life

Girl I am so in love with you
With you cause before you I was blind
Its the little things you do,
That makes me see you in my life

Im so deeply in love contigo
Corazon tu me tienes lleno mija de todo tu amor
Ive been lost baby, when Im not with you being close to you 
Is all I wanna do
Close my eyes and forget all the pain Ive been through
Its the birth of something good
Its just me and you against the world mamasita
Cause I love you its the truth
En mi Corazon estas tu
I will love you baby forever
En un dia eres tu la que completa mi vida 
Si este mundo fuera mio todo te daria
Y mija conmigo tu nunca sufrerias
No one is gonna love you, the way I love you
No one is gonna kiss you, the way I kiss you
Cause

[Chorus]
I am so in love with you
With you cause before you I was blind
Its the little things you do,
That makes me see you in my life

Check this out lil mama this is how I feel right here
Now even though the years have passed
Some good days and some bad
I never stop loving that sexy little laugh
The way you look into my eyes you can tell whats on my mind
I wanna give you everything that you want and so much more in life
Muchas gracias por todo lo que has dado even when I hated myself 
Tu siempre me has amado
Mamasita how can I repay the days and long nights
Forgave me when I acted crazy 
You stood by my side
Youre the reason why Ive made it through the years
Thats why Id never leave your side
Im staying right here
Im still in love with you because without you 
Id be through Im still in love with you because you showed me something true
Como te explico el sentimiento that I hold inside
That I can never turn my back because you are my life
Eres la reina de mi amor and this is true
Im so

[Chorus] 

Girl I am so in love with you
Cause before you I was blind
(I was so damn blind)
Its the little things you do
(All the things you did for me)
That makes me see you in my life
Baby..---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
