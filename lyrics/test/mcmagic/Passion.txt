It's the passion inside 
And your dreams come alive 
It's the burning inside 
I'm going to reach 4 the sky 
It's the passion inside 
I'm going to reach 4 the sky 

Just get your mind right 
Get your sprit up and then we can do it 
Keep your mind on the prize 
And keep prosing 
Average people make the world go round 
And average instruments make extraordinary sounds 
If you got talent baby let it shine 
Give it to the world 
And let them see what's inside 
You're like a treasure and you have the key 
Every minute of the day is what it takes to be 
The best of the best 
So give it all you got 
And maybe one day you'll be standing on the top 
But open up your eyes and realize 
No matter what you do you got to give it some time 
I want to see you dance 
I want to see you smile 
I want to see you laugh every day of your life 
I want to know that passion deep inside 
You tried every day even if it makes you cry 

It's the passion inside 
And your dreams come alive 
It's the burning inside 
I'm going to reach for the sky 
It's the passion inside 
And your dreams come alive 
It's the burning inside 
I'm going to reach for the sky 

Reach for the sky but I got to stay grounded 
As long as I'm breathing my heart is still pounding 
I see the vision when I close my eyes 
And if I stop right now than I might as well die 
Let the strength and the power you posses 
Take you to the limit and beyond to express 
A strong mind gets high on success 
A week mind gets high on bull sh*t 
And so I keep on rhyming 
Let my music and my flow get you all so excited 
Make you want to change the world today 
If you still got the passion inside it's never too late 
You got to move 
Got to show 
Got to rise 
You got to let the world see through your eyes 
Don't let no one tell you a lie 
Today is your day and it's time to shine 

Don't let nobody tell you that it's impossible 
Just follow your heart and your dreams 
Just follow your heart and your dreams 
Your dreams 
Hold up---Lyrics submitted by Angel.
