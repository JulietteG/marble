you were right by my side ready to ride out
through any situation with no hesitation

you were right there 
through the smiles and tears 
over the years we shared
the good and the bad
the rain and the sunshine
we've been through it all over and over again
you were my bestfriend 
who rolled with me until the end of the rainbow

you've been there for me from the 
struggles of paying bills

until the house on the hill
