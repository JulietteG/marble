boy: making love in the night time walks and romance 
im telling you hermosa my heart is in a trance 
they say that true love is so hard to find
 i thank the man up above for making you mine
 talking on the telephone sending you kisses
 a dozen of roses just to say that i miss you
 the warmth of your body right next to mine 
eres tu la mejor like a toast of fine wine 
out to the movies maybe sharing some ice cream
 si estoy dormido dont wake me from my dream
 todo lo que quiero all i need is your affection
 my life was fine but you brought perfection 
now we sit here just holding hands 
whispers in my ear tell me that  ill be your man
 today manana in a paradise for two
 i feel the same way cuz im so in love with you 

girl: i love the way you make me feel
 my love for you is oh so real embrace my body
