Have You Ever Love Somebody So much You Cant Sleep
Every minute by Your Side is like heaven to me

Even with all these Problems we Had to go Through
I do it all once again to Be with U

Forget what anybody Says This Yours and Mine
All I need is your touch and Your Love Everyday

(Zig Zag)
I knew it From My First Kiss 
Never Imagine Myself Feelin Like this 
I See Forever In Your Eyes 
You Took me by Surprise by the way U are
Youre the wish that Came true From that Falling Star
Youre the air that I breathe 
and everything I need
The Missing Piece that completed me
And Put me Back Together when I was under the Weather 
U were the Remedy that made me feel so better
Kisses & Hugs 
Xs & Os
At The end of Love Letters 
Sweeter than a box of Chocolates
Everyday is Valentine
When Im with U
Your My Lady 
And Im Your Ryder
And Im Always gonna be Here Beside cha

Girl I Love U more than anything in this whole world 
youre the Reason that My Life is so Beautiful girl 
Girl I need you more than the air that I Breathe everyday 
Please Dont Ever, Ever, Ever, Ever, Ever Go away
