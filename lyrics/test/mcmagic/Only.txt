Your the only one
you make my life complete
if i was eva to lose you 
i'd be losing everything
Your the only one
you make my life complete 
if i was eva to lose you
i'd be losing everything

i thank the day that i met you
heaven opend up the skys 
and sent me an angel
to change my life 
cause eva since that day
i aint eva been tha same
just to stand next to you is like a rush for me
i still remember one cold night when i confessed
and i would go crazy just to have one kiss
the more that i see you the more you penatrate 
my soul with your eyes dreaming every night
what my days would be like if i could love you for eva
to hear your pretty voice say that we belong together
maybe to have is like a million to one
but the is truth to me gurl


Your the only one
you make my life complete
if i was eva to lose you 
i'd be losing everything
Your the only one
you make my life complete 
if i was eva to lose you
i'd be losing everything

i nevea wana make you cry gurl
keep that on your mind 
when you need somebody more then just a frend
im on ur side
to hold u close wen ur nites get cold
to remind ever day dat ur so beautiful
i noe dat sumtimes life is just not fair
so wen it rains in ur heart ima be rite der
you see life is short and every min dat pass
is a moment gone 4 eva n is neva comin back
it kinda krazy how time has away makin all these 
memorys just fade away 
so if ders just one thing
that you remember about me
remember that i love u unconditionally


Your the only one
you make my life complete
if i was eva to lose you 
i'd be losing everything
Your the only one
you make my life complete 
if i was eva to lose you
i'd be losing everything---Lyrics submitted by Tania.
