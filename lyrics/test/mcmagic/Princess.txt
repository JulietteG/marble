Will you be my princess?
Can i love you lady?
pretty eyes, you always drive me crazy
will you be my princess?
can i love you lady? (can i love you girl?)
pretty eyes you always drive me crazy (can i make you my princess? check it out)

i think i met about a million girls before i saw your face
and now i know ill never ever be the same
must be your smile maybe eyes and lips maybe all just wrapped up into one
cause girl you got me breathing fast and thinkin slow 
making plans for never let you go
and if we make a promise girl ill never lie, be together til we 95
maybe you never had a man that understands the things that make you happy girl
but i can be the one to change it all cause see to me your just so beautiful
so when your ready for somebody who can really love you right 
give me a call and i can be the one to love you girl until the morning light

CHORUS:
Will you be my princess?
can i love you lady?
pretty eyes you always drive me crazy
will you be my princess?
can i love you lady?
pretty eyes you always drive me crazy

you drove me crazy from the first kiss to the first touch
to the first tme that we made some love
and now im giving you my heart, my days and nights
like music girl, you changed my life
whenever, whatever you need you can count on me
just sprinkle me with all your ecstasy
eres princesa de los cielos y por eso yo te quiero
i know ill never find another girl like you cuz i aint lookin
baby im tookin, you dig?
play this once again, show it to your friends
tell them you and me we riding to end
cuz your my girl keeper of my world
on top of this your the most beautiful
my heart and soul and all my kisses for you my princess


CHORUS:
will you be my princess?
can i love you lady? 
pretty eyes you always drive me crazy
will you be my princess?
can i love you lady?
pretty eyes you always drive me crazy---Lyrics submitted by kimberley.
