yo if lovein you is wrong i dont want to be right
(giggle) i bet you knew i was going to say that
thats because its true

ohhh ohhhh oooo yeah

uh uh

I use to tell you the stories about my childhood
you never ever believed me
about how I slept in trailer on a bed full of paper
okay well maybe im lying 
& its seems like lately when where talking on the phone
all you ever say is how I should leave you alone

everybody is telling me what I should do
I cant help myself I'm so into you
the doctor said that I'm love sick
well I guess I'll be sick forever
and I'm sorry to say that you made me this way
and I don't ever want to get better no
its obvious that I'm love sick
yeah
and maybe that I should take my medicine
try how hard as you may
no matter what you do
I can never get rid of you

you act like you don't remember
how you first met me 
way back when we were in grade school
I sat behind you in history
I use to day dream about the day I would have you
and it seemed like if I mentioned you when I was home
all my family said is how I should leave you alone

everybody is telling me what I should do
I cant help myself im so into you
the doctor said that I'm love sick
well I guess I'll be sick forever
and I'm sorry to say that you made me this way
and I don't ever want to get better no
it's obvious that im love sick
yeah
and maybe that I should take my medicine
try how hard as you may
no matter what you do
I can never get rid of you

oooohhhhhh

the doctors they couldnt be wronger
I think that we could last forever
dont want stay but I cant leave
nooooo
don't pay attention to them others
they don't want us to be together
I dont see why
because I'm perfectly fine

they keep on tellin' me that I'm love sick
well I guess I'll be sick forever
and I'm sorry to say that you made me this way
but I dont want to get better
no

You keep on sayin' you think I'm crazy
and that maybe I should take my medicine
try how hard as you may 
I could never get rid of you

No x 14

You keep callin me crazy
sayin maybe I should take my medicine
try how hard as you may 
no matter what you do 
I can never get rid of you---Lyrics submitted by Emmy.
