The Drugs aren't getting it done,
God this is fun I wish I was dead,
The pills aren't getting me by,
Don't want to get high, 
Just out of my head.

So call my doctor, buzz a nurse,
Yes it's clear I've gone from weird to worse. (yeah)
Burn my chart and read my lips,
Put me on a slow and steady drip,
What? Oh you did!?

The drugs aren't getting it done.
God this is fun I wish I was dead,
The pills aren't getting me by,
Don't want to get high,
Just out of this head.

I may be lazy, may be stressed,
Or something from my childhood's been repressed,
I tried the old ones and the new,
Pink and yellow, mellow baby blue, ow, it's no use!

The drugs aren't getting it done,
God this was fun I wish I was dead,
The pills aren't getting me by,
Don't wanna get high,
Just out of this head.

The drugs aren't getting it done,ow
The drugs aren't getting it done, 

Ow, no, ow no, on the run
mmmhmm, I'm done, Aint this fun?

I'm done!---Lyrics submitted by Kri Hersteins.
