Now that I found you, please dont go away
Dont leave me wondering if your gonna stay
I have risen, out from under this pain
Seems weve been given a chance to love again

Now that I found you dont you lose your way
Now That I Found You, Please dont run away

I can love you in my quiet way
I can hold you when your spirit fades
Yours is the kind of life I could breathe each day
Yours is the kind of heart Ive looked for everywhere

Now that I found you dont you lose your way
Now that I found you please dont run away

Oh in the morning
I would love to speak your name
In the nighttime, see you again
Well I could be wrong,
but I think it could be great
Great Great

Now that I found you, please dont go away
Dont leave me wonderin if your gonna stay
Love is seldom perfect, and its given to change
Id be glad if youd take my hand, and try love once again

Now that I found you dont you lose your way
Now that I found you please dont run away---
