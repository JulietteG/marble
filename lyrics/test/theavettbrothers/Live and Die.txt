All it'll take is just one moment and
you can say goodbye to how we had it planned.
Fear like a habit, run
like a rabbit out and away
Through the screen door to the unknown...
And I wanna love you and more,
I wanna find you and more,
Can't you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it!

You and I we're the same,
Live and die we're the same,
You rejoice, I complain
But you and I are the same!
Live and die, we're the same
You and I we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name,
You and I we're the same!
Live like a pharaoh,
Sing like a sparrow anyway,
Even if there is no land or love in sight

With bloom like roses, lead like Moses out and away
Through the bitter crowd to the daylight...
And I wanna love you and more,
I wanna find you and more,
Can't you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it to ya!
You and I we're the same,
Live and die we're the same,
You rejoice, I complain
But you and I are the same!
Live and die, we're the same
You and I we're the same

Hear my voice, know my name,
You and I we're the same!
I wanna love you and more,
I wanna find you and more.
Where do you reside?
When you hide, how can I find you?
Cause I wanna sin you and more,
I wanna tempt you and more
Can't you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it!

You and I we're the same,
Live and die we're the same,
You rejoice, I complain
But you and I are the same!
Live and die, we're the same
You and I we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name,
You and I we're the same!
You and I!
You and I!---
