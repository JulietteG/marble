I know that you're smiling, baby, 
I don't even need to see your face
Sunset at the shoreline, we are laughing, breaking up, 
Just like the waves
Are you feeling, feeling, feeling like I'm, feeling 
Like I'm floating, floating, up above that big blue ocean
Sand beneath our feet, big blue sky above our heads, 
no need to keep stressing from our everyday life on our minds
We have got to leave all that behind

Well, I have got a sister, 
And she has got a baby with brand new eyes
And her daddy is an engineer, 
And they just took her to the sea for the first time
Now they're under, under, underneath a big umbrella
Summer, summer, summer time to help us forget, nine to fives
We have got to leave all that behind

I have worries to give to the sea
We can walk dear the pier is farther than it seems

Midnight at the shoreline, fireworks above us
A screaming bloom
They're sent by some teenager and kid whoever you are
I am thanking you
Now we're dancing, dancing, dancing with no music
What is happening, happening, happening and no feelings
Except this is right
We just had to leave all that behind---Lyrics submitted by Todd.
