Yea, the wheels are grinding down a highway in the dark, 
Maps are useless, these roads are torn apart, 
I go blinded but guided by the shadows in my eyes, 
Lost all direction and the world has gone to bed, 
Digging in my pocket to get someone else's hand, 
What a different story, every solitary line I write, 
But I feel like I'm almost home, 
And I feel like I'm almost home, 

You looking for signs but it's way too late to ask, 
I see a million exits but I stare and let them pass, 
Though the road is paved its been narrowed by the secrets that it keeps, 
Well I see your face smiling through my tears, 
Pass another place and relive all the years, 
I gotta keep on smiling even when my heart begs to sleep,..

And I feel like I'm almost home, 
And i feel like I might be coming home, 
Keep a light on, let it shine on me, 
I think I am closer than I used to be, 
Keep a light on let it shine shine on me, 
I think I am closer than I wanna be... 

Now the wheels are grinding down highways in the night, 
No signs no streetlights not a resting stop in sight, 
but I go blinded but you know I'm guard, that I'm guarded by the shadows that are in my heart and you're in my heart 
and I feel like I'm almost home 
and I feel like I just might be coming home, 
I just might be home, 
You know I might be coming home...---Lyrics submitted by Julie.
