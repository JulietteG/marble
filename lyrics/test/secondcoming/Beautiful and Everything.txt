My heart was back and so i feel the fire
You came along and made the flames go higher
I used to sing but you taught me how to scream
Oh boy you beat me i do anything
I call it fire (fire)
Please dont call it L.O.V.E (love) x2

You scared me to death i don't know what to do
You're so Beautiful and Everything
Take hold of my breath feel my face turning to blue
You're so Beautiful and Everything

I tell the truth 
Ill burn your flesh
And I make you feel there is another
And when youre charge falls before my fire
i'll put you in the jar just so i can admire
Youre fire (fire) just
Please dont call it L.O.V.E (love) x2

You scared me to death i don't know what to do
You're so Beautiful and Everything
Take hold of my breath feel my face turning to blue
You're so Beautiful and Everything

[solo]

You scared me to death i don't know what to do
You're so Beautiful and Everything
Take hold of my breath feel my face turning to blue
You're so Beautiful and Everything
So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Verona.
