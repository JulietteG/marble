Here I am, laid bare, at the end of my rope.
I've lost all hope. So long!
Molly Connolly just broke up with me
Over the revealing nature of the songs.
You goddamn kids had best be gracious with the merch money you spend.
Coz for you I won't ever have rough sex with Molly Connolly again.

Here I am, laid down, at the end of my rope, wishing I had not been born.
Now I've spewed too much.
I can never shut it up. 
I thought you should be warned.
And I implied black sky took the needle to my eye and sucked out all its glow.
(Whoa!) Molly Connolly ruined my life.
I thought the world should know. (Hoa!)

I can't stop thinking 'bout what she did wrong to me.
Can't figure out just what I did wrong.
I'll kill myself thinking about things that you did it me Molly...Connolly.

(Can't stop thinking 'bout...) 
What she did wrong to me...
(Just can't figure out...)
Just what I did wrong...
(Kill yourself thinkin' 'bout...) 
The things you did to me Molly...Connolly. (Casey?)

Can't stop thinkin' 'bout.
Just can't figure her out.
Kill myself thinkin' 'bout
My Molly...Connolly.

(Can't stop thinkin' 'bout...)
I can't stop thinking 'bout it.
(Just can't figure out...)
I won't stop thinking 'bout it.
(Kill yourself thinking 'bout...)
I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself! I'll kill myself!
(Molly...Connolly!)
