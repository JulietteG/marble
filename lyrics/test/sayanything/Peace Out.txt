Sometimes I feel a baby nipping softly at my heel
A reminder of how fat and scared you love to make me feel
A curse of such a fetching fraud without a soul to speak
Inspired thirty songs I could have written in my sleep
You snort a line of syphilis and run the marathon
Your mentally deficient friends just ask you what you're on
I may be shy and not reply to your scathing review
But I'd rather subsist on venom than abstain with you

Chorus:
Oh I'll be fine
sever this for all time
I'll laugh it off when this ends 
You can just go get high with all of your dumb friends

I was the kind to ask what wrong doing had injured Dahmer's pride
Or to excuse the junkie thief with diamonds in his eyes
But now I taste a righteous fury sparkling with hate 
When you diddle this earth up and think "Fetch mommy, it's too late."
I'll bite your head off spit it out and let it plunge away 
You and all your kind won't stamp your future on today
The beat thumps loud you spit it out and grind on them for drugs
You hug that pole like a firefighter falling in love

(x2)
Never another song   
Never another thought
Never another song
Not for you

You were my crutch 
Now I've escaped your clutch
So how is that worm's eye view
I have grown two broad wings and now I'm above you.---Lyrics submitted by Mallory Houchin.
