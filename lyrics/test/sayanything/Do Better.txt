Life is not a spark in space  
an episode of will and grace  
controversial yet mundane  
deborahs messing with your brain  
even scientologists know theres more to all of this  
search the ruins for trap doors, wonder what you're put here for  
simple as a hint of gas climbing nostrils as you pass  
making harvards graduates feel childish when they laugh at it  
climb the rungs to kingdom come, sour patch to acid tongue  
are you opposed to having fun? you clentch the world between your buns  

you could do better, you could do better, you could be the greatest man in the world. you could do better, you could do better, you could be the greatest man in the world.  

your life is always the post of something else.. where is the present in the way that you present yourself? and it's discusting how little that you try, the existential equivalent of pink eye.  
drink alone and watch tv youre expecting harmonies,  
to tap your tune with silver spoons, and the anthem of impending doom.  
guiding satans steady hand, forcing beatles to dispand.  
it's ego freaks and drama queens, the young at heart know what I mean  

you could do better, you could do better, you could be the greatest man in the world. you could do better, you could do better, you could be the greatest man in the world.  
you could do better, better than that you're a fraud.  
thank god you learned to keep your shirt on.  
you could do better, you could do better, you could be the greatest man in the world.  

you burn so brightly, you burn so brightly in the dark  
you burn so brightly, you burn so, you burn so.  

you could do better, you could do better, you could be the greatest man in the world  
you could do better, you could do better, you could be the greatest man in the world  
you could do better, better than that you're a fraud.  
thank god you learned to keep your shirt on  
you could do better, you could do better, you could be the greatest man in the world.  
you could do better, you could do better, you could be the greatest man in the world  
we could do better, we could do better, we could be the greatest band in the world.---Lyrics submitted by jhon.
