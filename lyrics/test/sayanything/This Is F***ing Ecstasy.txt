I'm sprinting yet I stride
My satchel filled with vials
The secrets of the tribe
The cameras follow me for miles

Born a slave in 1984,
Discovered that my life is just a record they performed
A maze where I was placed
Tell me what you think of this one
Tell me what you think of this one

'Cause now I;ve sold you out
Now that there's no doubt
Now I've called you out
Now I've sold you out

They strapped me to the roof
and they cut right through me
Diggin' through my wounds
I watched them hopelessly and choke
Where are my pills, where is my former lover?
I've been betrayed by everyone I know don't blown my feeble cover.

Tell me what you think of this one.
Tell me what you think of this gun.

Now I've sold you out
Now that there's no doubt
Now I've called you out
Now I've sold you out

'Cause the truth is this:
I finally know what they conceived so long ago
A baby rat for them to test,
The poison's on a rubber breast
For me to learn; dependence on the shackles here
But now they're gone
The place I live in hyper speed

I shall not live; I shall not breathe again

(Hey Man)

This is fuckin' ecstasy
This is fuckin' leprosy
It's like they're fuckin' testing me
This is fuckin' ecstasy---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine.
