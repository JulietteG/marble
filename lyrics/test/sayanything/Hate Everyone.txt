did you know that there are people in the world
annoyed with all the other people in the world
and of all these angry people in the world
i am the angriest boy

when i was spat onto the earth in a stream of guts
by mother nature, that green-eyed slut
i wasn't the first to get forced from a cut
in one to whom i still shall stay stuck
staring from the cradle let my eyes take in
the baby-speak of my brain dead kin
their goo-goo goggles reflecting the grin
of a chub-faced alien

well if you think i'm being harsh
then baby keep on counting stars

because i hate everyone upon this cursed earth

then i grew a few hairs where the sun don't shine
they packed me in a classroom to count the time
studying the history of men's minds
chasing tail and committing hate crimes
rich hippie girl with a gas guzzler
forced myself to fall in love with her
she was so strung out she'd swear it never occurred
the honkey king went back on his word

the next one did the same
the blind leading the lame

all together now:
i hate everyone upon this cursed earth

how does it make you feel to be wanted?
how does it make you feel to be one of many?
how does it make you feel to be blunted?
how does it make you feel?

I hate:
Actors who seem genuine
My ex-girlfriend though she's feminine
The singer with the denim skin
That hospital in Texas
The rapper in the Lexus
The pills I ate for breakfast

I'm mired in hypocrisy 
yet i'm still down with JC
I guess that everyone includes me
And that's why I'm a humanist---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
