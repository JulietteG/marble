I was lost, I was scared, and I was broken
I was never meant to fall out on my own
I should have known
I could have turned to you for answers
But kept you further than the stars and off my mind
Was so blind

Tell me how, to turn my life around
Tell me how, I ever lived before I found you
Show me now
Will you come and breathe the answers into life
Cause living without you, I'm not alright

All I was in the past I left behind me
Now your love has cleared away all my mistakes
Walk by grace
When I see shadows in the distance
All the black and white can quickly turn to grey
Light my way

You find me in the places I hide
Your love lights up the corners of my mind
Oh without you, I'm not alright

I'm not alright
When I'm living without you, I'm not alright
Someone's lost, someone's scared and hearts are broken
But they were never meant to face life all alone
So I'll go, so I'll go, so I'll go---Lyrics submitted by amber.
