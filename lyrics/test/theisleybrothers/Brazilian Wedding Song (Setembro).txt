Today is the day to say I do,  
 Yes I promise to be true , 
I pledge all my love to you     always
Dont you know this ring this, ring is a symbol of  my love
Grant us blessings from above
OHooooooooooooooooooo
Who cherish all the magic of our days
Oh lord ,Oh Lord here I stand golden chains around our hearts
Vow to death well never part
From his day as one well start our lives

Oh lord here I stand  with my heart out in my hand
Rich or poor I am your man ,Im your lover and friend for life

O0000h  
So much love  so much love girl

La La La La  
Today ,today, today is the day to say I do
Yes I promise to be true
I pledge all my love to you always
Dont you know this ring this ring is a symbol of my love
Grant us blessings from above
Who cherish all the magic of     our days
And I can hear them when they play our Brazilian Wedding song---Lyrics submitted by Peggy.
