Well, yeah, oh

What do you do when you love somebody?
And everything is going wrong, oh no
Nobody knows the way you feel about it
Cos only you know you cant leave it alone

Chorus: 
Oh, here we go again
Oh, here we go again
I thought what we had was over
Here we go again, ooo, oh/baby
Oh/Ah, here we go again

What do you do when you love somebody?
And you decide to go it alone, ah no no
It never pays to give up on someone
when on the inside the feeling is strong 

Chorus:

Ah oh ooh 
After all weve been through baby, yeah
I keep coming back to you now
Ah oh ooh 
Out of all the women in the world
I keep coming back to, yooou yeah baby

What do you do when you love somebody?
And realize youre walking away oh no no
You hesitate when its time for leaving
You and I know its never too late

Chorus: 
Oh, here we go again
Here we go again
Dont ever say its over
Here we go again, ooh baby
Here we go again, ooh

Ah oh ooh 
After all we been through baby, well
I keep coming back to you babe/now, ah oh ooh
After all the sweet women of the world,
I keep coming back to, yoou yeah baby
