All I need is some peace of mind, leaving trouble behind.
I don't need no worry mind leaving trouble behind.

We don't need no confusion,
no animosity
We don't need no hatred,
envy or jealousy.

'cause all I need is some peace of mind, leaving trouble behind.
All I need is you to leave me alone, and then my trouble be gone.

We don't need no confusion,
no animosity
We don't need no hatred,
envy or jealousy.---Lyrics submitted by Andrea Mazzini.
