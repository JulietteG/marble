The dancer danced/She did a spin/She disappears
Here we are again
Imaginery

Well, the boy meets world
Falls in love with same
Boy loses world/Here we go again/Imaginery

Venting the krypton gas
An inch narrow n a foot tall
You sure let him jingle his spurs out loud
Oh, the goold ol boys
Never meaning no mean at all

Yes, I went to school/Yeah, learned to read
Oh, but please dont hold it against me
Love mercenary

If you boysd had nerve enough to dust off a fiddle
Youd never know who to trust
Give a fool a gun
Hes still a fool
But a louder one
Yes, you know the rules

Venting the krypton gas
An inch narrow n a foot tall
You sure let him jingle his spurs out loud
Oh, the goold ol boys
Never meaning no mean 
Oh, the goold ol boys
Never meaning no mean 
Oh, the goold ol boys
Never meaning no mean at all

And the dancer danced
And she did a spin
And she disappears
Here we are again
Imaginery
