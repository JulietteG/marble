Talent lady/Life is all in disarray
Fashion plate dancer, trapped in a playhouse 
which isnt all a play
Mother, daddy/Left behind some time ago
Surrogate parents, they spoil you and they feed you
Theyll never let go

Youre gone, you had to go
Miss you well
What went wrong? Will we ever know?
We wont tell

You say you love me/just because I understand
The problems that youre facing
But I cant make the commitment
Its out of my hands
Infatuation is often a misleading thing
Its just because youre lonely
Id stay with you/But only
Someone else pulls my string

Youre gone, you had to go
Miss you well
What went wrong? Will we ever know?
We wont tell
Youre gone, you had to go
Miss you well
What went wrong? Will we ever know?
We wont tell
If so, hope youre happy now
I do care

Infatuation is often a misleading thing
Its just because youre lonely
Id stay with you/But only
Someone else pulls my string

Youre gone, you had to go
Miss you well
What went wrong? Will we ever know?
We wont tell
Youre gone, you had to go
Miss you well
What went wrong? Will we ever know?
We wont tell
If so, hope youre happy now
I do care
I do care
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
