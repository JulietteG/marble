Forget what theyve told you all these years so long
About how theyre so brave/And how they got big n strong
Fine, everythings fine, thats what you say/I know

Fine, everythings fine, thats what you tell me:
I know better/Guess Im knowing whats going on
Forget what theyve told you all these years so long
About how theyre so brave/And how they got big n strong
Fine, everythings fine, thats what you say/I know

You talk about love/And all the time killing me
Amazing is your lack of humanity
Man, how can you stand/Related to where you are
Laugh, you senile ol fools/Whose power has gone too far
Fine, everythings fine, thats what you say/I know

How long can you feel/Too strong  
You took what you could steal
I know this kind of lifes no deal
The world burn, and the pace goes on/whose turn?
Its happening in Iran/Concern remember Lebanon?
Oh no!/The world stand still/Oh no  falling like Mr. Bill
Oh no!/That military field/Oh no! You got that rocket feel
Rocket feel

Third world all in flames/The future becomes the past
How long did they think/Their power would ever last
All political schemes/Will soon come to no avail
Youll see what I mean/The people will still prevail
Fine, everythings fine, thats what you say/I know

Fine, everythings fine, thats what you tell me:
I know better/Guess Im knowing whats going on
Forget what theyve told you all these years so long
About how theyre so brave/And how they got big n strong
Fine, everythings fine, thats what you say/I know
Fine, thats what you say/I know
Fine, thats what you say/I know
Fine, thats what you say/I know
Fine, thats what you say/I know
Fine, thats what you say/I know---Lyrics submitted by Paulo.
