You giving me such a bad time
Same old lie/say things getting better
Its still heaven for you, but me
Im still no better off and youre no better

We talk the fear of the Black and White ride
Of dem who blow you away
The cop who hit with the stick me upside
And talk about how they stop I today/But I know
You giving me such a bad time
You giving me such a bad time

You giving me such a bad time
Yet you cause such a vicious tangle
Still a trying for separation
All the while I see tis you you strangle
You always knock off your big boys quickly
Fire up every cold war scheme
You live by stereotype so sickly
Never know that this time is a dream
But I know

You giving me such a bad time
You giving me such a bad time
You giving me such a bad time
You giving me such a bad time
You giving me such a bad time

You giving me such a bad time
You giving me such a bad time
You giving me such a bad time
Same old lie/say things getting better
Its still heaven for you, but me
Im still no better off and youre no better
We talk the fear of the Black and White ride
Of dem who blow you away
The cop who hit with the stick me upside
And talk about how they stop I today/But I know
You giving me such a bad time
You giving me such a bad time---Lyrics submitted by Paulo.
