You're impossible
Immature, stupid, dumb, self-assured, difficult, irresponsible

And you don't understand taking my little heart like a criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal
Don't understand taking my little heart like a criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal
Don't understand, don't understand

You're guilty, I'm seeing it in your eyes
But I love you, and I don't know why
Guilty, you're just that kinda guy
But I love you, and I don't know why

I don't know why, I don't know why
But I love you, and I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
But I love you

You're ridiculous
Walking away when I need you to stay, unbelievable

And you don't understand taking my little heart like a criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal
Don't understand taking my little heart like a criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal
Don't understand, don't understand

You're guilty, I'm seeing it in your eyes
But I love you, and I don't know why
Guilty, you're just that kinda guy
But I love you, and I don't know why

I don't know why, I don't know why
But I love you, and I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
But I love you

Don't understand taking my little heart like a criminal
Don't understand taking my little heart like a criminal

Guilty, I'm seeing it in your eyes
Guilty, you're just that kinda guy

Guilty, I'm seeing it in your eyes
But I love you, and I don't know why
Guilty, you're just that kinda guy
But I love you, and I don't know why

I don't know why, I don't know why
But I love you, and I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
But I love you, and I don't know why---
