You're the boy with a real nice smile
But a broken hear inside.
Give it to a girl, gave it to a girl,
And I think she lost her mind.

Are you giving up and done?
Are you through with all this?
Are you tired of the pain?
Torn to pieces.

Can you let me try?

Tell me it's all right,
Just for one night.
Show you how to feel like,
What it feels like.
To be hugged, to be kissed.
Yes i can be that part of you.
I'll try my best.

I'm the girl, I can make you smile,
And I promise to be true.
Give it all,
Give until there's nothing left to lose.

Don't say you're giving up and done,
That you're through with all this.
Yeah you're tired of the pain,
Torn to pieces.

Can you let me try?

Tell me it's all right,
Just for one night.
Show you how to feel like,
What it feels like.
To be hugged, to be kissed.
I can be that part of you,
Let me be that part of you.

I see that you're breaking
Your heart is breaking.
Here's my hand if you'll take it,
We can make it out,
Of all this mess.
No more stress.
I can be that part of you
I'll try my best.

Give me your heart,
I don't want a piece or a part,
I want it all.
I want you to fall,
Just a little but.
Take that leap of faith,
If you want to,
Don't let that broken heart haunt you.

Can you let me try?

Tell me it's all right.
Just for one night,
Show you how to feel like.
What it feels like,
To be hugged, to be kissed.
Be thought of and to be missed.
I can be that part of you,
Let me be that part of you.

I see that you're breaking,
Your heart is breaking.
Here's my hand if you'll take it,
We can make it out,
Of all this mess.
No more stress.
I can be that part of you,
I'll try my best.

Oh-Oh.
(We can make it out of this mess,
No more stress.)
I can be that part of you,
I'll try my best.---Lyrics submitted by Renee.
