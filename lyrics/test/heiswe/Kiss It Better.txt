He sits in his cell
And he lays on his bead
Covers his head
And closes his eyes

He sees a smoking gun
And the coward he ran
And in his arms lays the bleeding 
Love of his life

And she cries
Kiss it all better
I'm not ready
To go
It's not you're fault love
You didn't know
You didn't know

Her hands are so cold
And he kisses her face
And says everything
Will be alright

He noticed the gun
And his rage grew inside
He said I'll avenge
My lover tonight

And she cried 
Kiss it all better
I'm not ready to go
It's not your fault Love
You didn't know
You didn't know

Now he sits behind prison bars
25 to life
And she's not in his arms
He couldn't bring her back
With a bullet to the heart
In the back of a man
Who tore his world apart

He holds on to the memory
All it is a memory
Hey hey

He cried
Stay with me
Until I fall asleep
Stay with me

Stay with me
Until I fall asleep
Stay with me

Stay with me
Until I fall asleep
Stay with me

Stay with me
Until I fall asleep
Stay with me

Kiss it all better
I'm not ready 
To go
It's not your fault love
You didn't know
You didn't know

Stay with me
Until I fall asleep
Stay with me

Stay with me 
Until I fall asleep
Stay with me

Stay with me
Until I fall asleep
Stay with me

Stay with me
Until I fall asleep
Stay with me---Lyrics submitted by Dalyn.
