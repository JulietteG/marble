What a sharp
(So sharp)
Imagination
What a pretty little pill that youre takin
So hard
(So hard)
You were tryin
To pull out all of the teeth from the lion
But you just got a fatal wound
But somehow you keep livin through
It must be something in your blood
That makes you keep on pullin up
Youve only got one heart
But a hundred people want it
If a hundred people owned it
Theyd be putting prices on it
If you had a hundred hearts
You could try to ration out em
But then one by one theyd break em
And youd only be without em
What a dark
(So dark)
Fascination
What an ugly little world that youre makin
Such a sweet
(So sweet)
Violation
You were slaughtering the sheep and youre takin
The only thing hell understand
Put it in your broken hands
Hide it in the lions doubts
And chew it up and spit it out
Youve only got one heart
But a hundred people want it
If a hundred people owned it
Theyd be putting prices on it
If you had a hundred hearts
You could try to ration out em
But then one by one theyd break em
And youd only be without em
Youve only got one heart
But a hundred people want it
If a hundred people owned it
Theyd be putting prices on it
If you had a hundred hearts
You could try to ration out em
But then one by one theyd break em
And youd only be without em---Lyrics submitted by Yossarian.
