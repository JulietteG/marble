[Chorus]
Life can be hard as a Monday morning
Or as easy as a Friday night
Just keep your wheels a rollin' oh baby
Everything'll be all right
Throw your cards up on the table
Throw your chips up to the pile
Forget about your life for a little while

She was East Coast Carolina
Straight away Louisiana bound
She caught up with an old friend
In a two place one horse town
Found a way to save for rent
Pay her bills with a slide guitar
Found her way to fame through a Mississippi whisky bar

His name was Jack the Poor Boy
He knew all the right things to say
But sixty-five and barely alive
Livin' life from day to day
Left Mexico to go see her show
Saw her lightin' up the sky
He left all he loved, he left it all behind

[Chorus]

I can still remember
How that girl used to make me smile
We talked a million hours
And we walked a million miles
Today I'm pressin' onward
I'm gonna color outside the lines
If she told me once then she told me a million times

[Chorus]
