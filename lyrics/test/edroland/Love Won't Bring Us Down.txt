Happiness is not disguised
You're looking out
It's right before your eyes
Bottled up and soon to blow
But life should be Ready, Set, Go

[Chorus]
I can feel what I believe, I say
Oh now baby 'cause love lifts me
I was bound but now I'm free, I say
Oh now baby 'cause love lifts me
Oh now baby 'cause love lifts me

Oooo oooo oooo
I said love won't bring us down
Love won't bring us down
Oooo oooo oooo
I said love won't bring us down
Love won't bring us down
(No no no)

You can't see your own good luck
Yeah, lightning strikes, but that ain't enough
Now it's time you recognize
That life is just one big surprise

[Chorus]

[Tempo change]

Come get in my world
In this world, sweet girl
Take my hand and I will lead
Take my heart and you'll believe
Take my love it's here for free
Take it all

[Chorus]
