Bye bye baby
I won't try to save you
You don't need me to learn to fly
Bye bye baby
Now I don't feel good lately
I'm leaving now before I don't wanna try

[Chorus]
Things became clear to me today
That we are already over anyway
And the only thing to do
Is for me to get over you
'Cause we're already over anyway

You'll cry, cry baby
By morning you'll seem fine
You really had me goin' for awhile
But that was confirmation
I'll never see behind
Nighttime tears, daytime smiles

[Chorus]

It's time for a new direction
Oooh ooh ooh ooh
No future hanging 'round I see
Like every bad investment
Oooh ooh ooh ooh
Will surely bring me down, down, down, down

[Chorus]

We will live, we will love another day [3X]---Lyrics submitted by Alex Johnston.
