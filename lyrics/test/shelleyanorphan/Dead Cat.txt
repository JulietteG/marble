Dead cat car crash deadest man
you lose the one you love and spring comes
sun shines and life goes on around you
two gravestones between them a spot of
velvet green

On a day I found that you were the one
who kissed my eyes then you smashed a smile
up and down up and down

Your head is full of nonsense you're told that it's
not serious be happy they want you to be happy
emptiness is a melancholy thing when you were
so sure you loved the one you wanted you were
so sure.

On a day I found that you were the one
who kissed my eyes then you smashed a smile
up and down up and down
sleeping while you wake a flower in the dark
but you were the one who kissed my eyes
Sleeping while you wake a flower in the dark
Be happy they want you to be happy
and you were so sure and you were so sure.

On a day I found that you were the one

you smashed a smile
up and down

Sleeping while you wake but you were the one
that kissed my eyes
Sleeping while you wake a flower in the dark
up and down up and down
on a day on a day on a day that you were
the opne that kissed my eyes.---Lyrics submitted by Luke.
