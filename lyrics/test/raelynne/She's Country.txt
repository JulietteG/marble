You boys ever met a real country girl?
I'm talkin' true blue, out in the woods
Down home country

Verse 1
She's a hot little number in her pick-up truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all-nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamma-jamma from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' Cajun, lunatic from Brunswick,
Juicy Georgia peach,
With a thick southern drawl, sexy swingin' walk

Chorus
Brother she's all country, shoot,
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country,
From the song she plays to the prayer she prays
That's the way she was born and raised,
She ain't afraid to stay country
Brother she's country

Verse 2
A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from a holler in Kentucky,
Get's ya flippin' kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess,
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover,
Thick southern drawl, sexy swingin' walk

Chorus
Brother she's all country, shoot,
From her cowboy boots to her down-home roots
She's country,
From the song she plays to the prayer she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay country
Nothin' but country

(Thick Southern drawl
Sexy swingin' walk)

Aw, show 'em how a country girl does it one time, now

Brother she's country
From her cowboy boots to her down-home roots
Nothin' but country,
Yeah, yeah

She's country, shoot,
From her cowboy boots to her down-home roots
She's country,
From the song she plays to the prayer she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay country
Yeah she's nothin but country,

She's all about the country

From the backwoods
She's home a grown
Down to the bone
She's country---
