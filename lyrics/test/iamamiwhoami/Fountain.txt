What lies beyond the fringe of the woods
Dust to dust so we leave for good
When all has gone to blazes I start to run
Until I find places where nobody's gone

No more weight on your conscience
with ease I go back to the start

Surge like a fountain
Like tide
And swallow the bleed
Flows like a fountain inside
Gather force from the sea
Riding this giant wave untied
Let it wash me clean

Crawling through deafening cold
Turning head there's no sight of home
Though my body's aching we have to push on
For every stride a new line is drawn

Surge like a fountain
Like tide
And swallow the bleed
Flows like a fountain inside
Gather force from the sea
Riding this giant wave untied
Let it wash me clean

From watching eyes I blindly rove
To guard my stories and find new gold

What lies beyond the fringe of the woods
Dust to dust so we leave for good---Lyrics submitted by Marco Matterazz.
