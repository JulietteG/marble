Moving close now
Your hands just knock me off my feet
Yeah, like a puppet now
I cannot move to my own beat

But I can dance tonight
I'll make up songs for us to sing
You hold my heart with cotton string
And to your rhythm I will shout
My love for play

Take off your hat
And pull a rabbit out for me
I'm like a lark, now
I lay on my back and on my knees

So I will dance now

But I can dance tonight
I'll make up songs for us to sing
You hold my heart with cotton string
And to your rhythm I will shout
My love for play

Dance, now---Lyrics submitted by LianBess Frongs.
