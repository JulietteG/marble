Little girl, tonight baby don't feel blue
Look at those party lights out on the avenue
You're out there on your own,
Spending all your time alone
So come on girl, tonight I want to be with you

This world has let you down nearly broke your heart
But tonight's the night for a brand new start
We'll leave this world behind
When we walk it on down the line
So come on girl, let's make one dream come true

So meet me out on the boardwalk tonight
Meet me down by the sea
We can dance neath the carnival lights
Ohh just you and me
We'll fall in love on a carousel
Little boardwalk angel

So meet me out on the boardwalk tonight
Meet me down by the sea
We can dance neath the carnival lights
Ohh just you and me
We'll fall in love on a carousel
Little boardwalk angel

Mmmmmm boardwalk angel
I want you to stand by me
My little boardwalk angel
La de dahhh de ahhhh
I want you to stand by me
My little boardwalk angel
La de dahhh de ahhhh (fade) ---Lyrics submitted by margreet.
