if you want someone to play with 
go and find yourself a toy.. 
baby my time is too expensive 
and I'm not a little boy 
if you are serious, 
don't play with my  heart
it makes me furious
but if you want me to love you
then a baby I will
you know what I will
tell it like it is..
don't be ashamed.. 
let your conscious be your guide..
but I know deep down in side of me
I believe you love me 
forget your foolish pride
live is too short to have sorrow
you maybe here today and gone tomorrow
you might as well get a what a you want..
go on and live.. baby go on and live..
tell it like it is.. 
I'm nothing to play with 
go and find your self a toy
but iii ... tell it like it is..
my time is too expensive and I'm not a little boy.. 
but iii. tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with .. go and find yourself a toy..
tell it like it is... 
and I'm not your.. I'm not your little boy---Lyrics submitted by Teresa.
