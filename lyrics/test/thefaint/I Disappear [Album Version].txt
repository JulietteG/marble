I disappear,
I lost control,
My body's moving,
On it's own.
I watch myself, 
Walk away, 
A poor spirit, 
took my place.

And he's there, 
Inside the door, 
So my exits is riding my pulse.
Burst of black, 
Breath of smoke.
I disappear, 
I lost control.

I, 
I disappear(x3)

I disappear,
I lost control,
My body's moving,
On it's own.
I watch myself, 
Walk away, 
A poor spirit, 
took my place.

I, 
I disappear(x3)

How could I resist, 
It's all I've wan-
ted I guess now I've got it.
Why it had been back, don't know, 
I hope this doesn't last forever.

I, disappear(x4)---Lyrics submitted by mario.
