(Damn nigga damn, took a chance on ya, double and dipped again)
Go!
You could do your dance
Take a chance with your lover like this began!
Sing

I want somebody who can take it apart
Stitch me back together, make me into who I wanna be
But all you ever do is sit in the dark
Dealing with the devil, you aint never ever gonna be mine

'Cause Im born to dance in the moonlight
I feel like spending my nights alone
I try to give you a little more space to grow
White lies, I dont wanna be around anymore
Im through giving, Ive got to go

Am I chasing time?
'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
Am I chasing time?
'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
Check my watch, I had the future in my pocket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)
If tomorrow drops I had my time right in my locket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)

Damn, nigga, damn
Took a chance on you, double d-dipped again
And, scram, nigga, scram
Hit your mans up and tell em to get the van
And reminisce again
Bring it back to the cabin in Michigan
But man, mister, plan
Say goodbye to your lover 'cause this the end

'Cause Im born to dance in the moonlight
I feel like spending my nights alone
I try to give you a little more space to grow
White lies, I dont wanna be around anymore
Im through giving, Ive got to go

Am I chasing time?
'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
Am I chasing time?
'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
Check my watch, I had the future in my pocket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)
If tomorrow drops I had my time right in my locket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)

Yo, get lost on the highway, freeway
We've been off-course like the wrong-way relay
Need me a boss, youre a constant delay
These the kinda thoughts I've been having for three days
Feel like youre more of a homie
Please, you dont even know me
You think Im starting new relations
Im just departing and need my space and
Time to myself, ventilation
No time for you, I lack the patience
And youre like, Girl, how you do that?"
My attitude is bitchy but you already knew that
And since we cant get along
I think we should both move on
(Go!)

'Cause Im born to dance in the moonlight
I feel like spending my nights alone
I try to give you a little more space to grow
White lies, I dont wanna be around anymore
Im through giving, Ive got to go

Am I chasing time?
'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
Am I chasing time?
'Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)
Check my watch, I had the future in my pocket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)
If tomorrow drops I had my time right in my locket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)---
