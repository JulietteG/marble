High heeled sexy demonette
wild and crazy hair
long red nails, a black corset
I love it when you swear
I give you Dead black roses,
when you're down or sad
you make life perfect & worthwhile
you make me cry you make me mad,
most of the time
you make me laugh and smile
[my girl]

nothings better than
the way you bat your eyelashes at me
/You're my nekromantik babe/Let me be
/I'm demon, you're my best friend/
/You're my Ghoulina Girl/
let me be your scream queen fantasy
[my girl]

leather-laced tempting sweet milk-face
cute little ponytail
red lips, ready for first base
with a look like that you just cant fail
I give you dead black roses
I'm a demon, your best friend
you're my partner in bed & in crime
all the way to the end
you're innocent and sinful
at the same time
[my girl]

There is nothing better than
the way you abt your eyelashes at me
You're my Nekrofelia
let me be you scream queen fantasy
[my girl]

Fishnet stockinged femme fatale
my graveyard banshee
no doubt you're my subcultural gal
and I'm your zombie
I give you dead black roses
you give me pleasure & pain
You make my dark heart swirl
and drive me madly insane
No matter what
you'll alway be my girl---Lyrics submitted by cinthia.
