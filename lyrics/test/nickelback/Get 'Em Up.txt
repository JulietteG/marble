His driver license says James, he went by Jim
A gangster wannabe, and baby, that was him
He stole his uncle's 44 last Friday night
Said if I wanted in, we'd have to plan this thing just right
We'll need the gloves, we'll need the bags, a couple masks
We'll need to steal a car with windows tinted black
He picked the nearest bank on Main and 17th
We wrote down every line from every movie that we've seen

Screaming
This is a robbery, now get down on the floor
We're here for all this shit that you don't need no more, yeah
We want your cash, open the safe, get off your phone
Don't be a hero, and you might just make it home
Get em' up, and get down
Reach for the sky, then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get em' up, and get down
Reach for the sky, then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get em' up
Get em', get em' up

The freshly stolen Mustang small block 302
Drove pass the bank a dozen time this afternoon
The only parking spot was half a block away
Gave us time to practice just exactly what to say

Screaming
This is a robbery, now get down on the floor
We're here for all this shit that you don't need no more, yeah
We want your cash, open the safe, get off your phone
Don't be a hero, and you might just make it home
Get em' up, and get down
Reach for the sky, then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get em' up, and get down
Reach for the sky, then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get em' up
Get em', get em' up

The only thing I wish that one of us had known
That it was Sunday and the god damn bank was closed
Too bad we didn't see the cops across the street
We dropped our guns and tried to run
And there went all our dreams

Screaming
This is a robbery, now get down on the floor
We're here for all this shit that you don't need no more, yeah
We wanted easy street, now we'll never know
Somebody called my mom, and tell her I ain't coming home
Get em' up, and get down
Reach for the sky, then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get em' up, and get down
Reach for the sky, then go ahead and kiss the ground
Get em' up---
