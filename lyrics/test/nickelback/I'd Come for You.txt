Just one more moment
That's all that's needed
Like wounded soldiers
In need of healing
Time to be honest
This time I'm pleading
Please don't dwell on it
Cause I didn't mean it
I can't believe I said
I'd lay my love on the ground
But it doesn't matter
Cause I made it up
Forgive me now
Everyday I spend away
My soul's inside out
Gotta be some way
That I can make it up
To you now ..somehow
By now you know that

I'd come for you
No one but you
Yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
I'd fight for you
I'd lie it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'll always come for you

I was blindfolded
But now I'm seeing
My mind was closing
Now I'm believeing

I finally know just
What it means
To let someone in
To see the side of me
That no one does
Or ever will
So if you're ever lost and
Find yourself all alone
I'd search forever
Just to bring you home
Here and now ..it's a vow

By now you know that
I'd come for you
No one but you
Yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
I'd fight for you
I'd lie it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you


No matter whats get in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what...remember
You know I'll always come for you

Yes I'd come for you
No one but you
Yes I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
I'd fight for you
I'd lie it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'll always come for you
No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what....remember
You know I'll always come for you

I'd crawl across this world for you
Do anything you want me to
No matter what... remember
You know I'll always come for you
You know I'll always come for you---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
