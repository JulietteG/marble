(feat. Flo Rida)

Wake up, my baby still looks amazing with no makeup
Damn it, I knew the second that you came up
From underneath the covers say
I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother
One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me
But darling, my shit ain't moving around the country
And now we're buying diamonds, saying
It's only 20 karats, it can't be that hard to find it baby
Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity

She's got me runnin' round and round
She taste like the sunshine kissing me
Bit sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
She taste like the sunshine kissing me
Bit sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round

Life on Sunset, can't imagine the two ain't having fun yet
Baby maybe just wait, 'cause I ain't drunk yet
As soon as I look over, there's no way to sugarcoat it 
You were busy motorboating on that blonde girl
But you doing nothing wrong girl
Looks like we got another come along girl
If you ain't afraid to try it
You know he'll be flying private as long as I can be the pilot, baby
Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity

She's got me runnin' round and round
She taste like the sunshine kissing me
Bit sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round
She taste like the sunshine kissing me
Bit sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round

She's got me runnin' round and round
You're out of girl
You got me runnin' round and round

[Flo Rida rap]

She taste like the sunshine kissing me
Bit sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me

She's got me runnin' round and round
She taste like the sunshine kissing me
Bit sweeter than a honey on a bumblebee
She said honey if you want you can come with me
She's got me runnin' round and round

She's got me runnin' round and round
She's got me runnin' round and round---
