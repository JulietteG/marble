This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough, so I'll be waiting for the real thing.
I'll know it by the feeling, the moment when we're meeting
will play out like a scene, straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up til the end
Until that moment when, I'll find the one that I'll spend forever with.

Chorus
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moon light
And dammit this feels too right
It's just like deja vu, me standin here with you
So I'll be holding my  breath, could this be the end
is it that moment when, I'll find the one that I'll spend forever with

(Chorus)
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

You can't give up
when you're looking for
a Diamond in the rough
cause you never know
when it shows up
make sure you're holding on
cause this could be the one, the one you're waiting on
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, Oh

Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
and everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there
(what are you looking for)
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
(you never know)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
(start holding on)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there---Lyrics submitted by Jeremy.
