I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so  

I just woke up from a dream too deep  
I've gone back, but you still look the same  
That's surreal to have you back with me  
It's just too bad, it's just another dream  

(Give me just one year)  
If I could give it all  
Wait until it's just for one more dream  
I thought I had the time to wait  
Now it's too late to tell you that  

I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do (I, I miss you so much)  
I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do (God knows I do)  
I miss you so so, I do   
I miss you so so, I do (I, I miss you so much)  
I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do  

After dark laughing in the rain  
Silver heart, lock it all a dream  
And pictures fade, and silver turns to grey  
But the best of deeds couldn't take my love away  

(Give me just one year)  
If I could give it all  
Wait until it's just for one more dream  
Traded it for one more moment  
Tell you what I never told you  
All the things I left unsaid  
I meant to save it before you left  

I thought I had the time to wait  
Now it's too late to tell you that  

I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do (I, I miss you so much)  
I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do (God knows I do)  
I miss you so so, I do   
I miss you so so, I do (I, I miss you so much)  
I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do  

If there was some way, you know I would  
I do it today, I wish I could  
I promise your name, it does no good  
I wish I know what would  

I, I miss you so much  
God knows I do  
I, I wish my wish was enough  

(Give me just one year)  
If I could give it all  
Wait until it's just for one more dream  
Traded it for one more moment  
Tell you what I never told you  
All the things I left unsaid  
I meant to save it before you left  

I thought I had the time to wait  
Now it's too late to tell you that  

I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do (I, I miss you so much)  
I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so, I do (God knows I do)  
I miss you so so, I do   
I miss you so so, I do (I, I miss you so much)  
I miss you so so, I do  
I miss you so so---
