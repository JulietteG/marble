Soaking through
Colours that held us up against the wall
(x2)

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away,
Hold your colours against the wall
With me...

(Twisted the knife and opened your eyes) (x12)

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away,
Hold your colours against the wall
Soaking through 

(Twisted the knife and opened your eyes) (x8)

Ahhh, she looked into your eyes,
And saw what laid beneath,
Don't try to save yourself,
The circle is complete,
We're reaching out and into you,
Nothing else could touch me

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away,
Hold your colours against the wall
Soaking through
(With me)

twisted the knife, opened your eyes
twisted the knife, till you were in the right place (x4)

Ahhh, she looked into your eyes,
And saw what laid beneath,
Don't try to save yourself,
The circle is complete

(Twisted the knife and opened your eyes) (x8)

Fading gently,
Soaking through,
And starting not to show at all
We're reaching out and into you,
Nothing else could touch me

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall
With me...
