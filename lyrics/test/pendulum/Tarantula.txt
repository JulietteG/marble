Blad tarantula,
Time for the massive come sing ya,
Blad tarantula,
Don't play with my style I might sting ya,
Blad tarantula,
You want me inject me bacteria,
And if ya body goin' stiff,
And your spine goin' numb,
Now come for get some...

Time to fix you up something here right now...


Shotter, hitter, serial killer,
Go a your funeral and all drink out your liquor,
When you are bury we a-stand next to the vicar,
Fling on some dirt and make your bury a little quicker,
Shouldn't test the youth them in the Tommy Hilfiger,
Hug up you mama, say sorry to you papa,
All a get number for the little sister
A shall we call her Ill ask her, freeza---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
