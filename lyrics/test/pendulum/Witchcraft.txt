It's in your eyes, a colour fade out,
Looks like a new transition.
The starting up and shaking your ground,
Turning your head to see a new day calling.

Does it feel like a head to lean on?
A snapshot from when you were born.
I'm looking for your hand in the rough,
You're caught in the wire...
Well I'll lift you out.

Leading on the action,
Caught out of cell phone range.(?)
Bleeding on the sofa,
Staring at the waistline.
He's coming and she knows it,
Even though she knows why.
Footsteps from the hallway,
Girl you havn't got time.

You gotta get out,
go far away.

You gotta get out,
go far away.

Darkness in the bedroom,
Maybe shes resting up?
Maybe she was out late,
Just come back from the club.
I can't here her breathing,
Something doesn't seem right.
Heal her in the hallway,
We're leaving on a set time.

We gotta get out,
go far away.

We gotta get out,
go far away.---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
