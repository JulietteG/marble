Now this feels broken - like I got nothing left to lose
I feel so sorry - that you've got no one left to use
So take this token - I leave it up to you to choose
Between what's right and
the stupid shit you always do
I've waited for the end of us
And I won't give up 'til you're buried head first
And I will laugh hard when you cry
I will dance the day you die
Because you're dust and I'm still alive

This is my parade cause I broke your curse
Now I'm diving into the sea head first
And I'm on my way cause I prayed for this day
For the first time in my life - I feel so alive

Now that it's over - I guess I was too blind to see
It all meant nothing
Now you mean nothing more to me
The words unspoken
You couldn't say them to my face
As each day passes more of our past will be erased
Now we leave this all behind
So let me give you one last goodbye
and say I never really cared
and each moment that we shared
I'll gladly watch as those memories die---Lyrics submitted by b.
