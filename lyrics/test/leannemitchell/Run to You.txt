I know that when you look at me
Theres so much that you just dont see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart youd find
A girl whos scared sometimes
Who isnt always strong
Cant you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone

[Chorus:]
I want to run to you (oooh)
I want to run to you (oooh)
Wont you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away

Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night I come home and turn the key
Theres nobody there, no one cares for me
Whats the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it mean?

[Chorus]

I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
If you only knew how much

[Chorus]---
