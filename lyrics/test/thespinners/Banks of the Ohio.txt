I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk a little way
And as we walked, why then we talked
Of our coming wedding day

Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no other arms entwyne
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I plunged my knife into her breast
While gently in my arms she pressed
She cried, "Oh, Willy! Don't you murder me!"
"Im not prepared for eternity!"

Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no other arms entwyne
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I took her by her lily white hand
And I led her down by the river strand
First I picked her up, then I cast her down
Stood and watched her slowly drown

Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no other arms entwyne
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I started home 'twixt twelve and one
I cried, "My God! What have I done?"
I've killed the only woman I love
Just because she wouldn't be my bride

Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no other arms entwyne
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

The sheriff's men came to my door
'round about the hour of four
They said young man with us you must go
For you killed that girl by the ohio

Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no other arms entwyne
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio---Lyrics submitted by Raymond Mullin.
