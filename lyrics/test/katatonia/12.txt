Black theatre of love
Violet dances cast their blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

12 shapes bow before her
I am still one of them
12 morbid ways to die
Her beauty scares me

I'm falling deeper
No more pain to feel now
Touch the silence
Afraid of hell

Black theatre of love
Violet dances cast their blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

I cannot breathe
I am losing life
The moon paints the skyline blue
She died so beautiful---Lyrics submitted by mohamed.
