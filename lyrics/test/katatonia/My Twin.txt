The neck and then the chain
The head is hung in shame
The neck and then the chain
The head is hung in shame
I thought that you had grown
That you would carry on
But now that I am gone
What else has been withdrawn

You used to be like my twin
And all that's been
Was it all for nothing
Are you strong when youre with him
The one thats placed you above us all

I think of love 
I let it pass
It feels like fire
But it won't last

What is it coming to
I am unwilling to go on
You have lost
No one has won---Lyrics submitted by Emilie.
