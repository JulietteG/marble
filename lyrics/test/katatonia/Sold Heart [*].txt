When my heart stops
 Will my wings unfold
 Did you know that I had no one but you

When my eyes close
 Will your blood turn older
 Did you know that I had no one but you

In the snow veil
 Where the ring of promise fell
 In the cool white air
 One stood abiding
 When the road turns
 Will my ghost find freedom
 Did you know that I have nothing
 So I

Sold my love
 Forgot the vow
 It feels like nothing comes to mind
 I pull the weight
 And sing
 That there's a new cloud over my grave
 Now I know
 That it did kill me when I could not have you
 Sold my heart---Lyrics submitted by taymaz.
