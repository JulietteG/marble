I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
You never listen when I talk maybe you'll listen when I walk
So I made up my mind and made a sandwich and I didn't shed a tear
I gave you one last minute of my time in this mess I left behind

You'll come home tonight and turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find my little good-byes

Empty hangers by the closet floor
Lipstick tube on the bathroom floor
Unpaid bills by the kitchen phone
I took the Beatles, left Billy Joel
My little good-byes

I'm sure you're sure I'll be back in just an hour or two
You'll tape a Hallmark to my door
They always said it better than you
And if ya wonderin' if you're gonna hear from me
Well take a real good look around boy
And it won't be hard to see

When you come home tonight
And turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find
My little good-byes

Took your favorite Dodgers hat
Left the litter, but I took the cat
My little good-byes
Loaded up the TV in the back of my car
Have fun watching the VCR
My little good-byes
Little Good-byes, oh baby, little good-byes

Bridge:
So cry to your mom and your sympathetic friends
And tell 'em how the story ends

My Little Good-byes
Took the hourglass left the sand
Now you got time on your hands

My little good-byes
Took the statue from Japan
Funny little Buddah man

My little good-byes
Changed my voice on the machine
Or there'll be little good-byes with every ring
My little good-byes

Left the pictures took the frames
Got the umbrella, here comes the rain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rain, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah,yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Little Good-byes ---Lyrics submitted by kaeli.
