Every kiss before this
Was nothing but a waste of breath
And every I love you was just a whoop-de-doo
Never knew what I missed before this

Da, doo, doo, doo
Ooo, Ooo

And every love song before you came along
Was always about someone else
Oh, and every star was just a wish too far
Always a realist, yeah, before this

And the way things go, you never know
Where love will lead you to
And everything we've ever dreamed
Lies before me and you

People say, it's not everyday
That you find the perfect fit
But when I fell for you, I found the other shoe
Cupid was a myth before this

And the way things go, you never know
Where love will lead you to
And everything we've ever dreamed
Lies before me and you

Yeah-
Da, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Da, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Da, doo, doo, doo, doo
Yeah

And the way things go, you never know
Where love will lead you to
And everything we've ever dreamed
Lies before me and you

And the way things go, you never know
Where love will lead you to
And everything we've ever dreamed
Lies before me and you

Yeah, before me
Me and you---Lyrics submitted by Caitlin.
