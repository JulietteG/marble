No, I'm not good looking
And I don't do nothing
And I don't say nothing
And I don't mean nothing
Practically good for nothing
But loving you, but loving you

Please baby, let me be your slave
Please let me clean your house all day
Please let me try to bake your bread
And tuck your sweet babies into their beds

I'll show you how nice a woman can be
I'll show you how nice a woman can be
I'll show you how nice a woman can be
If you'll only speak some sweet words about me

I might even cook something actually edible
Who knows, it might even turn out to be incredible

Please baby, let me be your slave
Please let me clean your house all day
Please let me try to bake your bread
And tuck your sweet babies into their beds

I'll show you how nice a woman can be
I'll show you how nice a woman can be
I'll show you how nice a woman can be
If you'll only speak some sweet words about me
Speak some sweet words about me ---
