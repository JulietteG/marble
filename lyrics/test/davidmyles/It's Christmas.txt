It's the warm firelight on a cold winter's night
It's the stranger that's holding the door
It's the generous smile, the mother and child
It is peace ringing out over war

It's the angels and snow, faces that glow
After spending the whole day outside
It's the food on the table
Being happy and grateful
For family and friends at your side

It's Christmas, Christmas
Christmas time is here

It's so good, it's a shame
That it can't be the same
Every day of the year

It's the knock at the door, family of four
Singing those old Christmas songs
It's the weak and the strong
The old and the young
It is everyone singing along

It's Christmas, Christmas
Christmas time is here

Christmas, Christmas
Christmas time is here

It's so good, it's a shame
That it can't be the same
Every day of the year

It's Christmas, Christmas
Christmas time is here

It's so good, it's a shame
That it can't be the same
Every day of the year---
