It's such a funny sensation to be
So happy that you want to die
Promises always were crazy to me
But never was I so surprised
Minutes are longer when we are apart
Your presence is more than i can handle
It has come to a point where i would wonder afar
Could ever be lucky or win

Suddenly I'm back at the core
Thinking of her who had you before
And were you as good, as good as we are?
Do you remember?

Did you love her the way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
traces of her that you are carrying
under the surface?

Lend me your ears
I would like to confess
I'm doubting that you can be real
I'm by your side wearing a beautiful grace
I celebrate how good it feels
Say that you love
Say that it's true
I know that I want to believe you
But somehow silence speaks louder than words
I'm worried she is still on your mind

Suddenly I'm back at the core
Thinking of her who had you before
And were you as good, as good as we are?
Do you remember?

Did you love her the way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
traces of her that you are carrying
under the surface?

I know that I'm selfish
I know that it's bad
I know, but it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad...

Suddenly I'm back at the core
Thinking of her who had you before
And were you as good, as good as we are?
Do you remember?

Did you love her the way you love me?
Is there a chance that there might be
traces of her that you are carrying
under the surface?

under the surface...
under the surface...---Lyrics submitted by edz.
