[Intro] 

Ay, what's up ladies? 

This your boyfriend, V.I.C. 
And my homie, Canton Jones. 
And we wrote this song on behalf of every man, 
To let y'all know what we want. 

[Intro] 

[V.I.C.] 

Ok... 

She is every man's want, 
Every man's need. 

She is every man's desire, 
Every man's dream. 

See, I done been around the world, 
And seen a lot of things. 

Slept with a lot of dimes, 
Now, looking for a queen. 

I'm looking for the one that will complete, 
Me like a puzzle-- 
Ain't gonna let me just work for your needs. 

Not, V.I.C. or, 
Or Mr. 'GetSilly', 
Or Mr. 'BeatItUp'. 
Now, baby... (????) 

[V.I.C.] 

[Chorus] 

You the wifey type, 
The wifey type, 
The wifey type, 
The wifey type, 
Baby, you the wifey type. 

[Chorus] 

[Canton Jones] 

Baby, you're the wifey type. 
With you, wanna spend my life. 

Not goin' out with my homies, girl 
'Cuz it's wifey night. 

It's whatever wifey likes, 
We don't even fuss and fight. 

Whatever you want, you just do it, 
You're my Nike wife. 

You can live that icy life, 
Don't worry 'bout prices, wife. 

Whatever it is, you're my queen, 
Girl, the price is right. 

And you represent the Christ, 
Baby that's the main thing, 
That set you apart from all of these other 'Plain Janes.' 

[Canton Jones] 

[V.I.C.] 

So, let me slow it down, for Wifey. 
Now, I'm gettin' the down on one knee. 

[V.I.C] 

[Chorus] 

Wanna spend my life with you! 
Baby, you're the wifey type. 

Baby, you're the wifey type. 
Wanna spend my life with you! 

You the wifey type, 
The wifey type, 
The wifey type, 
The wifey type, 
Baby, you the wifey type. 

[Chorus] 

[V.I.C.] 

Ay... 

She is the kind of girl I need. 
She is the right girl, just for me. 

This woman loves God more than me. 
She is the kind I call, 'wifey.' 

Ay, girl-- 
You the one I want to mess with at the end of the day. 

'Cuz I'm tired of the games, tired of the chase. 
And I'm tired playing house forplay.

'Cuz you do a lot of things for your boyfriend, 
Like cook, clean and give it up to your man. 

Thats the reason I can get it up for you, babe. 

so, baby... Ay! 

[V.I.C.] 

[Chorus] 

You the wifey type, 
The wifey type, 
The wifey type, 
The wifey type, 
Baby, you the wifey type. 

[Chorus] 

[Canton Jones & V.I.C] 

You're the type of girl I want to meet my mama! 

(She's the wifey type) 

Yeah... and it's just me and you, now, forget the drama. 

(She's the wifey type) 

Mmm... I don't have to be afraid, because I trust you! 

(She's the wifey type) 

Yeah...I love my music and my car, and I love you. 

(She's the wifey type) 

Wanna spend my life with you! 

[Canton Jones & V.I.C] 

[Canton Jones] 

Baby, you're the wifey type! 
Woah, my girl, you're the wifey type! 
Ha, wanna spend my life with you! 
Baby, you're the wifey type! 
Ha, you're gonna make me take you to church, girl! 
You're the wifey type... the wifey type! 

Oh my god! 

[Canton Jones] 

[V.I.C.] 

Let me slow it down, for wifey.
