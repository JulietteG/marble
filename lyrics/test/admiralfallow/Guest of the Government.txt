So you've tied your colours to the mast
Held up the white bag with the highest flag
Lock the bathroom door, boy, have a blast
Use the flush to justify the aftermath (The aftermath)

Oh and look now you're the guest of the government
Oh caught out peering over the parapet
Look now you're the guest of the government

So you've tied your colours to the tree
Try and bat back questions with certainty
Don't forget your name though that's key
Let the flock take stock and curb the misery (The misery)

Oh and look now you're the guest of the government
Oh caught out peering over the parapet
Look now you're the guest of the government

Oh and look now you're the guest of the government
Oh lined up like a pale faced president
Look now you're the guest of the government

Look it's the eager barflies and the fashionably late
The tug between those who come to drink and those to create
By the end of the night it's all been granted the old news shrug
And we all fall gently in a comfortable hug
And with both eyes on the watch and a trip to the Baltic state
And the love slowly conquers like rust on a gate
Though the surface can scratch you and the colour can fade 
It's the feeling that starts in the tips of your toes as we rise up again

Oh and look now you're the guest of the government
Oh caught out peering over the parapet
Look now you're the guest of the government

Oh and look now you're the guest of the government
Oh lined up like a pale faced president
Look now you're the guest of the government---Lyrics submitted by morgan leask.
