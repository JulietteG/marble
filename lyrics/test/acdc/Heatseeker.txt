oooooo get ready

get ready to rock
get ready to roll
i'm gonna turn up the heat
i'm gonna fire up the coal
i gotta keep that motor turning
i gotta keep that engine clean
i gotta keep those tires burning
i've got the best you've ever seen
and i'm a heatseeker
charging up the sky
and i'm a heatseeker
and i
i don't need no life preserver
i don't need no one to hose me down
to hose me down

get ready to break
get ready to go
get your shoes off and shake
get your head down and blow
you gotta keep that women firing
you gotta keep that serpent clean
you gotta make her sound the siren
you gotta hear that lady scream
cause i'm a heatseeker
burning up the town
and i'm a heatseeker
and i don't
i don't need no life preserver
i don't need no one to hose me down
don't hose me down

(:D angus young guitar solo! :D)

heatseeker
i wanna see him get up
and see the whites of your eyes
and i'm a heatseeker
(heatseeker)
i'm gonna measure you up
i'm gonna try you for size
and i'm a heatseeker
gotta keep that motor turning
you gotta keep that engine clean
you gotta keep those tires burning
i've got the best you've ever seen
and i'm a heatseeker
heatseeker
and i
i don't need no life preserver
i don't need no one to hose me down
woah i'm a heatseeker
and i'm a heatseeker
heatseeker

out on the street!
feel the heat!---Lyrics submitted by Kaila.
