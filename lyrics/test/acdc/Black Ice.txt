Well the devil may care
You toss 'em back and be a man
With the last time
Black Ice
End of it all, end of the line
End of the road...

Black Ice
Black Ice
Come on and bleeding out the crowds 
We're watching all the women go
Many a mile I'll never take
I run for forty miles and I come up runnin' late
Don't you know I live it down
When the devil come a callin'  I ain't gonna be around

Black Ice 
Black Ice 
Black Ice 
The devil come a callin' I ain't gonna be around
Black Ice

Livin' Long, livin' long
Sleep all alone, you're gonna take it all
And I'm gonna rip it out
I'll kick, I creep crawl down your street, I'll gouge your eyes out
Black Ice
Black Ice
Black Ice
Black Ice
My life
Black Ice
My life 
Black Ice
My life

When the devil come a callin' I ain't gonna be around
I'll kick, I creep crawl down your street, and gouge your eyes out
Black Ice---Lyrics submitted by Juilio.
