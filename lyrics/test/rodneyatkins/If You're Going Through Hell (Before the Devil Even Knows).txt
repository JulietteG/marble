Well you know those times when you feel like
There's a sign there on your back
Says, I don't mind if you kick me, seems like everybody has
Things go from bad to worse
You think they can't get worse than that
And then they do

You step off the straight and narrow
And you don't know where you are
Use the needle of your compass, to sew up your broken heart
Ask directions from a genie in a bottle of Jim Beam
And she lies to you...
That's when you learn the truth 

[Chorus]

If you're goin' through hell, keep on going
Don't slow down if you're scared don't show it
You might get out fore the devil even knows you're there

Well, I've been deep down in that darkness
I've been down to my last match
Felt a hundred different demons breathin' fire down my back
And I knew that if I stumbled I'd fall right into the trap
That they were layin'
Yeah...

But the good news is there's angels everywhere out on the street
Holdin' out a hand to pull you back up on your feet
The one's that you've been draggin' for so long
You're on your knees you might as well be prayin'
Guess what I'm sayin'

[Chorus]

Yeah, if you're goin' through hell keep on movin'
Face that fire, walk right through it
You might get out fore the devil even knows you're there

[Chorus]

Yeah, if you're goin' through hell keep on movin'
Face that fire, walk right through it
You might get out fore the devil even knows you're there
Yeah you might get out fore the devil even knows you're there
Yeah...---Lyrics submitted by Tracey.
