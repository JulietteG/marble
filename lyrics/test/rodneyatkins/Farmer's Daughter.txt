well i heard he needed some help on the farm
somebody with a truck
and two strong arms
not scared of dirt 
and willin to work till the sun goes down
so i pulled up and said "I'm your man. I can start right now"
and we shook hands
he said the fence needs fixin',
the peaches need pickin',
and the cows need bringin' round.

I was haulin hay,
i was feedin the hogs,
and that summer sun had me sweatin like a dog
so i cooled off in the creek
and it was back to work in that dadgum heat
i was cussin out loud, thinkin bout quittin
lookin back now i'm sure glad i didn't
'cause just when i thought it couldn't get no hotter,
i caught a glimpse of the farmer's daughter.

she was just gettin home from Panama City,
she was all tanned up
and my kind of purtty
when i her eyes met mine 
i was thinkin that i sure love my job.

as the days got shorter
our talks got longer
the kisses got sweeter
and the feelins got stronger
so we'd hop in the truck
and get all tangled up
every chance we got.

we were down by the by the river
all night long.
when the sun came up i was sneakin her home
and draggin my butt to work
with the smell of her perfume
on my shirt.
i'd be on the tractor,
she'd be on my mind
with that sun beatin down on
this back o' mine.
and just when i thought it couldnt get no hotter,
i fell in love with the farmer's daughter.

we got married last spring
woahh and there aint 
no better life for me.

i'm still haulin hay
and feedin the hogs
and that summer sun's
got me sweatin like a dog
so i cooled off the creek
and she brings me out a glass of sweet iced tea
and i'm on the tractor
she's on my mind
and i can't wait til' it's quittin time
and just when i think it can't get no hotter,
i come home to the farmer's daughter---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
