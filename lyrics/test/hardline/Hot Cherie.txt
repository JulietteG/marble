Been too long since the last rain 
Still the stars sizzle hot in the sky 
And there, undressed in the shadows 
Stands my sweet Cherie hiding from July 


And all night you kept me up, up all night 
Hoping that I could make you mine 


Refrain: 
You're getting me hot, Cherie 
I want what you've got all over me 
Isn't my love strong enough 
I'm ready to rock you long and rough 
You're getting me hot, Cherie 
I want what you've got all over me 
I'm going crazy 


I can't wait for October 
When the breeze from the lake, she's blowing cold 
Well maybe she'll need me for some shelter 
When the campfire dies and the tall tales have been told 


And all night I've been working overtime 
Hoping that I could make you mine 


Refrain---Lyrics submitted by Jeremy.
