Here comes that feeling burning in my heart again
And why's it coming back, back to haunt me again
Well I can't stand it, it hurts me blind
Whatever I can see, you appear on my mind

[Refrain:]
Without you I can't find my way
I can't find my way
All those stormy nights can't wash away the pain
I can't find my way

Here comes that feeling burning in my heart again
Are you ever coming back, back in my arms again
Well I can't stand it, another lonely night
Whatever I can see, you appear on my mind

[Refrain]

Nobody told me it would be easy
Oh life they say can't always please me
Well I can't look back now that she's gone---Lyrics submitted by Roel Lasala.
