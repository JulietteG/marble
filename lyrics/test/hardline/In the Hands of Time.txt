Alright, oh yeah
Living every moment, holding on to a dream
Staring at an empty page, winter comes to me
And I wonder will the light ever shine on me
If its a mountain I must climb then thats the way it must be

Oh, day after day, like a lifetime away I keep holding on
Yeah, night after night, out of reach out of sight from it all
Oh, day after day I wont walk away from this dream of mine
Woah yeah, its in the hands of time

Living every moment with a dream burning bright
Never stop reaching when the dream shines it light
Will I take it for granted when the tryings all said and done
Cause the pain of remembering plagues the dreams I want

Day after day fight the storm shade of grey and keep holding on
Night after night Ill be your light on your way
Oh day after day I wont walk away from this dream of mine
Woah, yeah, its in the hands of time

Day after day like a lifetime away I keep holding on
Night after night, Ill be your light on your way
Day after day I wont walk away from this dream of mine
Woah, yeah its in the hands of time---Lyrics submitted by Traci Zea Burnes.
