Na na na na na na na na na , na na na na nah
Na na na na na na na na na, na na na na nah

I know how you feel girl, been there many times before
I got to pick up, Im walking out the door
Sometimes hoping is all that we can do
In mind and spirit girl Im always there for you

Every time I think about us, the way its got to be
You know someday we will work it out
When all that we wished for is just a memory

Any time you need me Ill be there
Any time at all (just say the word)
Just you say the word and Ill be there
Anytime you need me girl I will be there

The nights seem longer, the days feel just the same
Well a little more lonelier than yesterday
Sometimes words aint easy to explain
Whether Im here or gone the feelings stay the same oh yeah

Every time I think about us, the way its got to be
You know someday we will work it all out
When all that we wish for is just a memory

Anytime you need me Ill be there
Anytime at all (just say the word)
Just you say the word and Ill be there
Anytime you need me girl I will be there

Oh yeah, woah yeah, all right
Anytime you need me Ill be there
Anytime at all (just say the word)
Just you say the word and Ill be there
Anytime you need me I will be there

Na na na na na na na na na, na na na na nah
Na na na na na na na na na

Just say the word, say the word yeah
I will be there

Na na na na na na na na na, na na na na nah
Na na na na na na na na na

Just say the word, say the word, say the word yeah
I will be there

Im always there for you, everytime---Lyrics submitted by Traci Zea Burnes.
