Well you know I dont need you
And I dont feed you no lies
Yeah, yeah
And its not up to me to tell you
What you see through your eyes
Yeah, yeah
You know girl sometimes I just dont know
Where it is you still think you can go
Without taking my world well maybe you dont realize
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)

That time that I met you
Theres something that set you apart
Yeah, yeah
The smile on your face
Or your lips
Or the taste of your heart
Yeah, yeah
You followed me away from your home
And were out here in this world on our own
And its too late to go back
And its too late to leave me alone
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)

Cause you paid for the love that we got
You paid
Yeah, yeah
And you made for the heart to be fought
And you stayed
Yeah, yeah
Was it strength or your pride
That sent you back inside
For the love that you paid for
Or was it for the love that we made
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)

You know I dont need you
And I dont feed you no lies
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Maybe I didnt come with instructions like some other guy
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
You see me standing at the window
With my world at my back
And my eyes down the road
Staring at the wreckage of a lifetime strewn along the track
And the seeds that were sowed
You think Im wishing I was some other place
But in fact Im right here
And my shoulder to lean on baby
And my heart in with you
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)

And you can see that its not always easy
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Maybe that makes you crazy
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
But can you see that Ive spent all I had
that you go on making me glad
That I found your love in this world after times were so bad
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)

And you paid for the love that we got
You paid
Yeah yeah
And you made for the heart when we fought
And you stayed
Yeah, yeah
Is it faith or your will that keeps you hanging on still
For the love that you paid for
Or is it for the love we made
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, (yeah, yeah)---
