Time on my side, a stowaway in the slipstream
A time I could glide the shifting currents of my dream
In my dream, the singing is coming from the sky
In my dream, the sunlight was falling from one side
And every blade of grass was casting its own shadow.
And every little bird was singing its own song.

Time in my mind, the path of least resistance
The future almost blind, both in need of assistance
In my mind, the question is: sunrise or sunset?
In my mind, I'm certain nothing's certain yet
With every grain of sand casting its own shadow
And every ray of the sun flashing on the sea

Time may heal all wounds
But time will steal you blind
Time the wheel, time the conqueror.

Time to decide what kind of world I believe in
The world open wide,
Or the world about to stop breathing
In my world, I'm standing just inside the door
In my world, I'm speaking into the ocean's roar
And every thought of you casts its own little shadow
And everything I wanted, is subject to review.

Time may heal all wounds,
But time will steal you blind.
Time the wheel, time the conqueror

Every thought of you casts its own little shadow
(Time may heal all wounds,but time will steal you blind.)
Everything I wanted is subject to review
(Time the wheel, time the conqueror)
(Every grain of sand...)
Time on my side...
(Every little bird...)
((fades))
Time will heal...Time...---Lyrics submitted by michael.
