Just be my lady
Everthing will be alright
Just be my lady
I'll love you everyday and night
Just be my lady
I promise you that everything will be alright

Just be my lady
That's really what you ought to do
Just be my lady
This love I have was meant for you
Just be my lady
Everything you ask of me, sweetheart I'll do, for you

My promise to you
Is that I'll always be true 
No matter what no one, no one tries to do 
Til death do us part you can have my heart
Forever and that's a long, long time

Just be my lady
That's all I'm gonna say
Just be my lady
Just take my hand and I'll lead the way
Just be my lady
And there's no better time to start than today, today
Just be my lady, all mine
Just be my lady, all mine 
Just be my lady, all mine
Just be my lady, all mine(fade)---Lyrics submitted by Flonoy Chambers.
