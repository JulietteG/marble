People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with Gods
Hoes is all my disciples, you get mind fucked with these broads
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you practice
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket
Woah, think it's time for a revolution
Me and my dawgs 'bout to start a riot
You still there sleeping, bet I'm eating
You and your people are on a diet
Tim Allen off Home Improvement
Intelligent but we going stupid
This some new shit
Hit the strip club, see some hoes that I went to school with
Out in London like Lennox Lewis
Bitch looking like Farrah Fawcett
I'm just tryna make better music
Get this money, share the profits
Now this class getting led by students
Smoke some weed, get head while I do it
Started out under the ground
They didn't fuck with me, now they all coming around
Money I'm hunting it down
Planting the seeds
Working and watching it grow
I got so many ways I can make money, I'll always be straight
I just thought you should know
Been on my grind, taking what's mine
I got my eyes on the throne
I'ma be fine, no matter the time
We all go along with the show

That girl beautiful, somebody introduce me
She ain't your girl tonight, nah, that bitch a groupie
That's money in my building better give it to me
I see you starin' at me like you in the movies
Now you watching movies
Y'all are looking at my life it's like you watching movies
Looking at my life is like you watching movies
Y'all are looking at my life is like you watching movies

People worship these idols 'til they come in contact with gods
Hoes is on my disciples, you get mind-fucked by these broads
Life is just a recital, better remember all that you practice
When I die, throw a couple bad bitches in my casket
Woah, fuck a day job, fuck a day job
Gotcha bitch here in just a tank top
Gettin' paid, blow my face off
Bitch you're bank fraud, Bernie Madoff
Educate y'all
Then erase y'all
LL Cool J without the Kangol
I don't see the need to stunt
Wish you the best, I'ma just light up this blunt
This bitch love me long time, don't know why she wouldn't
Say my D could win the Heisman, yeah I'm Charles Woodson
Couple million off a tour, that's a lot of bookings
My bitches gorgeous looking imported from the shore of Brooklyn
Coming from out of the 'Burgh
Bitch, I'm absurd
Fuck you, I hope you insured
Hatin'? I'll give you just what you deserve, that's my word
Put it on all that I'm worth
Been on my grind, taking what's mine
I got my eyes on the throne
I'ma be fine, no matter the time
We all go along with the show

That girl beautiful, somebody introduce me
She ain't your girl tonight, nah, that bitch a groupie
That's money in my building better give it to me
I see you starin' at me like you in the movies
Now you watching movies
Y'all are looking at my life it's like you watching movies
Looking at my life is like you watching movies
Y'all are looking at my life is like you watching movies ---Lyrics submitted by Elle Cameeno.
