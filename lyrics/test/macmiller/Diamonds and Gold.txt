She keep on gettin' played like it's recess, break her heart's a reflex
 She want to hit the beach and show her titties down in Key West
 Someone leave her cryin' all the time and now she finally out of Kleenex
 Sick of dudes not givin' her the respect

 'Cause really she a genius, a CEO
 Tryin' to be on top alone, she don't keep them close
 She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss
 Tough bitch, probably would've thought she played lacrosse

 Sick of being soft with her heart broken all the time
 Want some money too, fuckin' dudes and fallin' all in love with who
 Was nothin' new, only comin' through to bust a nut or two
 She just need her family like the Huxtables

 And now she on the road, left them home to takeover
 Get rich and have her crib made over
 But she gonna do it partyin' with her cup full
 Ain't gonna trust you but she gonna fuck you

 She wants diamonds, she wants gold
 But she's scared to let you get too close
 And she's been high and she's been low
 But now she finally on her own

 And they've been lookin' so they been findin'
 'Cause she ain't runnin' and she ain't hidin'
 'Til she finds her place back home
 And she finally all alone

 She gonna be rich as fuck
 In high school they were callin' her a slut
 But now she comin' up, Louis Vuitton and Juicy on her butt
 See the bitches that be hatin' like 'what's up?'

 'Cause they ain't doin' nothin' and she out here stuntin'
 Middle finger to them hoes, all them bitches had it comin'
 Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down
 Invite you to the crib, let you look around

 Just a fuckin' tease, tryin' to get your cheese
 Invite you out to dinner 'cause she wanna eat for free
 She could pay it if she wanted to, she won't though
 Go home, she got more dough

 She wants diamonds, she wants gold
 But she's scared to let you get too close
 And she's been high and she's been low
 But now she finally on her own

 And they've been lookin' so they been findin'
 'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
 'Til she finds her place back home
 And she finally all alone

 She wants diamonds, she wants gold
 But she's scared to let you get too close
 And she's been high and she's been low
 But now she finally on her own

 And they've been lookin' so they been findin'
 'Cause she ain't runnin', she ain't hidin'
 'Til she finds her place back home
 And she's finally all alone---Lyrics submitted by Malcolm McCorm.
