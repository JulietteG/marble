Mississippi Queen, If you know what I mean 
Mississippi Queen, she taught me everything

Way down around Vicksburg, around Louisiana way
Where lived the Cajun lady aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes was gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine

Mississippi Queen, if you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen, she taught me everything

This lady she asked me, if I would be her man
You know that I told her, I'd do what I can

To keep her lookin' pretty, buy her dresses that shine
While the rest of them dudes was makin' their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was loosin' mine

(music break 8 bars)

You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes was gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine
Ahhhhhhhhhhh

Mississippi Queen---Lyrics submitted by Madonna.
