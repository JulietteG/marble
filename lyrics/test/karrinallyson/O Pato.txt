O Pato

O pato
the duck was dancing by the water,
quack, quack, quack
the rhythm made him think he oughta
quack, quack
he was dancing to the samba,
the samba, the samba

Oh goose ooh
The goose was gaining passing by,
honk, honk, honk
he stopped and gave the dance a try,
honk, honk
he was dancing to the samba
the new thing, the new swing

Then a lovely swan swam by
in all her majesty
then she loosened up,
hoochy coochy coo did that swan,
she joined the duck
and goose and did the samba too.
you should have seen
the kind of samba she could do,
they did the samba so long
they all fell right in the water
while they were swinging away
quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack,
quack
quack, quack, quack
quack, quack, quack
quack 

O pato
the duck was happy to begin it,
quack, quack, quack
and he was really getting in it
quack, quack
and he was dancing to the samba,
the samba, the samba

Oh goose ooh
The goose came fast as he could move,
honk, honk, honk
he joined the duck and struck groove
honk, honk
the bossa nova had him dancing
the new thing, the new swing

Then a lovely swan swam by
in all her majesty
then she loosened up,
hoochy coochy coo,
did that swan
she joined the duck and goose
and did the samba too,
you should have seen
the kind of samba she could do,
they did the samba so long
they all fell right in the water
while they were singing away
quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack, quack
quack, quack, quack
quack, quack, quack
quack
