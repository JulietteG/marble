Oh a lifetime isent enough to love ya
And a lifetime isent enough to live
Oh a lifetime isent enough to love ya
And what lifetime isent enough to live

I may be different than you
Critisized for what I do
I chose to expose the truth
The truth of me and I wont be afriad.. on that day
I stand on my feet,because I am yeah
Took a risk, a chance just to understand
Well I have been cold, for a savage *
Misunderstood, yeahh
Light the lamp I will sacrafice to find you
Cuz a lifetime isent enough to love ya
And a lifetime isent enough to live
Oh a lifetime isent enough to love ya
And what lifetime isent enough to live

Been around so many people
Without you im all alone
Gazing into space
My exsistence are known
I dont want to be here, I want to be near.
I stand on my feet, because I am yeahh
Took the risk, a chance just to understood
When I been cold for a savage *.. misunderstood
Light the lamp I will sacrafice to find you
Cuz I lifetime isent enough to love you
And a lifetime isent enough to live
Oh a lifetime isent enough to love
And what lifetime isent enough to live?

Am I so different than you?
Critisized for what I do.
Chose to expose the truth.. the truth of you
And I wont be afriad , on that day
I stand on my feet, because I am yahh
Took a risk a chance just to understand
Cuz a lifetime isent enough to love ya
And a lifetime isent enough to live
Oh a lifetime isent enough to love.. yah
And what lifetime isent enough to live
Eyy.. a lifetime isent enough to love yah
And what lifetime isent enough to live? ---
