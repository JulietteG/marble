I get up,
I get up
Everyday

Got to take a lift,
For still we must endure
The trials that we face,
Oh the war that we know
Patience give us virtue,
For The seeds we must sow

I get up,
I get up
Everyday
I get up,
I get up
Anyway

See the light today,
Hey, you know we got to find a way
We been through a lot of shift
Baby the race isn't for the swift
So smile with the sunrise
There's a lot of life to live

I get up,
I get up
Everyday
I get up,
I get up
Anyway

Been to the dark place
Surviving the hate
It tries to bring you down
Oh the world is just that way
And through the noise a whisper
Arise and awake

I get up now,
I get up now
Everyday
I get up
I get up
Anyways

When all the doors are closed
There's only one thing to do
It always makes it hard,
Sometimes you got to break the rules
And no one else can walk
In your shoes

I get up
I get up
Everyday
I get up
I get up
Anyway

Yes, I get up
I get up
Everyday
I get up
I get up
Anyway

I get up
I get up
Everyday
I get up
I get up
Anyway

I get up
I get up
Everyday
Now, I get up
I get up
Anyway ---
