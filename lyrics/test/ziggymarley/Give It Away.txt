You can hide it deep inside
And don't speak a word of it
You can play the fool
And say you've never heard of it
Oh no

Hold on tight,
You can try,
Though you'll wind up losing every time
Ay!

Only if we give it away,
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Yeah

Had it locked up in a box
So it'd never get away from you
Oh no
And you held on so tight
Cause of what you were afraid to do
Oh yeah

Count your coins
Pour your wine
Don't you end up lonely time after time

Only if we give it away,
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Yeah

Now give it away
Give it away
Now give it away
Ay Ay
Now give it away
Alright

There's not a man alive
Who can stand up and walk away from it
In fact I even knew some men
Who think that they can pay for it
That's not real,
It's a lie
So they end up crying time after time
Oh!

Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love
Only if we give it away
Can love be love

Now give it away
Give it away
Now give it away
Give it away
Now Give it away
Give it away
Now give it away
Give it away
Now give it away
Give it away
Now Give it away
Give it away

I'm gonna give it away
I'm gonna give it away

Only if we give it away
Can love be love,
Now give it away ---
