Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders?
Why do I always help you carry your boulders?
You wonder why I carry such a weight on my shoulders
And why would I, it's such a load

Cos someday you'll see
Next time I'll try it another way

Why would you try to make me friends with them soldiers?
When you know that I've never been familiar with orders
When you know that my heart is in a pretty disorder
And you should know that in my heart you fill every corner

And someday you'll see that all I want is to please
Next time I'll try it another way

How long will I sit and wait like a soldier?
How many summers will it take?
How many summers will I wait?
How many shoulders will I break?

Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders?
Why am I always by your side when you're down?
Why did I help you build a beautiful house? 
And why did I break my back for you in the cold?

Cos someday you'll see
Next time I'll try it another way

Why would I have to quit if time makes me older?
Why do they wonder why I never get bored?
How could I tell them that I'll never let go
But hey, you're my man but they just won't understand

And someday you'll see that all I want is to please
Next time I'll try it another way

How long will I sit and wait like a soldier?
How many summers will it take?
How many summers will I wait?
How many shoulders will I break?

Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders?
Why do I always help you carry your boulders?
You wonder why I carry such a weight on my shoulders
And why would I it's such a load

And someday you'll see that all I want is to please
Next time I'll try it another way

How long will I sit and wait like a soldier?
How many summers will it take?
How many summers will I wait?
How many summers will I wait?---Lyrics submitted by zer.
