People let me tell you 'bout my best friend, 
He's a warm hearted person who'll love me till the end. 
People let me tell you bout my best friend, 
He's a one boy, cuddly toy, my up, my down, my pride and joy. 

People let me tell you 'bout him he's so much fun 
Whether we're talkin' man to man or whether we're talking son to son. 
Cause he's my best friend. 
Yes he's my best friend.
