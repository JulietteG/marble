(Me acuerdo ese dia que estabamos caminando entre los arboles gigantes... que crecen hasta el sol, entre las sombras, tu y yo caminando...creciendo... abriendo nuestros ojos.)

I try to run away from you but in the end i feel i've gone nowhere...
You're not the kind that's best for me, but i believe that you've got that something..
Don't you know that you're not like everybody else?
Can't you feel that you get me like no one else?

Of all the gifts you've given me, the greatest one has been silence..
I might kid and climb and off the tree and expecting one more mistery... I'm fallin'
From the thought of my life if you should stay
There is no point to this life if we don't risk it all away..
Libertaiaiad.... Libertaiaiad... Libertaiaiad..
Libertad, Libertad. Libertad, Li-ber-tad

I try to run away from you but in the end i feel i've gone nowhere...
My feet are firmly planted on your ground and I've discovered i'm growing..
And the fruit of my actions has gotta be shared
Cuz the freedom you've given me has brought me here...

Libertaiaiad... Libertaiaiad... Libertaiaiad....Libertaiaiad
Libertad, Libertad, Libertad, Libertad

I try to run away from you but in the end i feel i've gone nowhere...---Lyrics submitted by Karina FH.
