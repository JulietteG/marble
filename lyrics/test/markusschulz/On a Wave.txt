Come wash over me
Come wash over me

I feel you inside my mind, like the breeze from the sea, yeah
Every word I hear you say, keeps me warm like the summer rains

I feel like (feel)
Like I'm on a wave, heading straight for shore, heading straight into your arms I
Feel like (feel)
Like I'm flying high, drifting on a cloud, heading straight for you, yeah

Come wash over me
Come wash over me

Time is moving by so slow, relaxing with my thoughts of you
Close my eyes and float away, dreaming of the things we would do

I feel like (feel)
Like I'm on a wave, heading straight for shore, heading straight into your arms I
Feel like (feel)
Like I'm flying high, drifting on a cloud, heading straight for you, yeah

Come wash over me
Come wash over me

I Feel like (feel)
Like I'm on a wave, heading straight for shore, heading straight into your arms I
Feel like (feel)
Like I'm flying high, drifting on a cloud, heading straight for you, yeah

Feel like (feel)
Like I'm on a wave, heading straight for shore, heading straight into your arms I
Feel like
Like I'm flying high, drifting on a cloud, heading straight for you, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Jezzi.
