Mary did you know that your baby boy would some day walk on water
Mary did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters
Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new
This child that you've delivered will soon deliver you 

Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man
Mary did you know that your baby boy will calm the storm with his hand
Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod
When you've kissed your little baby then you've kissed the face of God

Mary did you know
Mary did you know

The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak, the praises of the lamb

Mary did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation
Mary did you know that your baby boy will one day rule the nations
Did you know that your baby boy was heaven's perfect lamb
This sleeping child you're holding is the great "I AM"---Lyrics submitted by Brenda.
