Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees
Is just blue like him inside and outside
Blue his house with a blue little window
And a blue corvette
And everything is blue for him and hisself
And everybody around
Cos he ain't got nobody to listen

I'm blue da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die (2x)

I have a blue house with a blue window.
Blue is the colour of all that I wear.
Blue are the streets and all the trees are, too.
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue.
Blue are the people here that walk around,
Blue like my corvette, its sitting outside.
Blue are the words I say and what I think.
Blue are the feelings that live inside me.

I'm blue da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die (2x)

I have a blue house with a blue window.

Blue are the words I say and what I think.
Blue are the feelings that live inside me.

I'm blue da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die da ba dee da ba die (2x)---Lyrics submitted by Fred.
