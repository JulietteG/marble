When we first met, baby
You said it was me and you
But I found out later
That was others too

But I didn't quit you, baby
I hung on like a vine
But when you say your love for me
Was all in my mind

Oh, that did it, baby
Lord, that did it, baby
Well, ain't no need in coming back
That's the end and that's that
Oh, you did it, baby

I work six days a week
In the rich folk's yard
And anybody can tell you, baby
That kinda work is real hard

You know I didn't mind
Taking care of you
But I saw your other man
Wearing my brand new shoes

Oh, Lord, that did it, baby
Oh, that did it, baby
Well, there ain't no coming back
That's the end and that's that
Oh, you did it, baby

There's one thing I wanna say

You said we'd get married
In the early spring
I passed a pawn shop today
I peeked in and saw my ring

You say you needed the money
To pay your rent
But I saw you sitting at the bar
Spending your last red cent

Oh, that did it, baby
Oh, that did it, baby
Well, I know you think you're slick
But you played your last trick
Oh, you did it, baby

Lord, you did it, baby
It's all, it's all over now, baby
I said you played your last trick now, baby
Lord, it's all over---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
