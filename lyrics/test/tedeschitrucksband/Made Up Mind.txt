I know you wish that you could see in my window
Wishing you could pull up the vine
And I'm wearing my Romeo flowers
Just being my made of mind
I know you lack of all in my garden
Apple yourself a big bouquet
You can spell them I know
It's just like I told you
I'm in a higher place

I got a made up mind
I got a made up mind
And you're thinking about it all the time
You're all fine
I got a made up mind

Well you better see me out on a contest
Cause you lost me at the crossroad sign
Year that was an old man
Now you can't hold me
All cause of this made up mind
Yeah you're looking for me up in the basement
You can look down in the Milky Way
Oh halla my name and I won't hear you
Cause I'm in a higher place

I got a made up mind
I got a made up mind
And you're thinking about it all the time
You're all fine
And I got a made up mind

I'm going higher
I'm not afraid
Licking my finger
Trilling the page

Oh I got a made up mind
Always be there up all the time
Sure as the moon as the stars gonna rise
I got a made up mind
I got a made up mind
Some made up mind
I got a made up mind oh oh
Oh, oh
Now this all be over
And my mind is made up
I got it made up
I got it made up---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
