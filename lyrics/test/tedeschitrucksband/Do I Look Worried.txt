Back in the day when I lie
he always find.
Now here you are full around
Out every night.

I don't have to take it anymore
And I'm tired of always keep it slow
All I say
Do I look worried to you?
Oh, do I look worried?

Stand in the face, soldier just claims you were wrong
I try it again, stay 'till the end, but how long?

We've been here so many times
And I know you've spent me so many lies
All I say
Do I look worried to you?
Oh, do I look worried?
Ohh, worried to you
Ohh, 'cause I ain't worried.

Fool me once or twice, you know they say: Shame on you!
Now that I know with the man he's without you
I find my way [?] be gone
'cause there's nothing seems
All I say
Do I look worried to you?
Oh, do I look worried?
Ohh, worried,
Ohh, 'cause ain't worried
Lord, 'cause I ain't worried
You better, you better be worried
Ohh, I'm worried, worried, worried, worried


Yeah I ain't gonna take it
Anymore
Ohhh!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
