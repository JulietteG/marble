Bra if yo cash ain't right, right now dawg shit just fucked up right now dawg u done took
A lost when a bitch don't wanna give you nothing dawg telling you dawg u can make something happen

[Chorus: x2]
My money looking funny nigga just making it barely shit ain't how it use to be nigga ain't
Fronting the package gotta choke me a bitch outta something I gotta have it I'm on my
Dick dawg gotta make something happen

[Verse 1:]
When a nigga money fucked up it's hard for him to think straight
Seem like a nigga life in park when he ain't got cake
First thing that cross a bitch mind shid he gotta take
U can stay broke forever or u can make a shape
Cause when u broke bitch talk to u any kinda way
U on ya dick bitch don't wanna here shit u gotta say
If u ain't built for this street shit den get out the way
Cause when a nigga broke everybody's fucking gravy
U either get money out chere or u fucking hate
U think a nigga gone give u something den keep waiting
U betta suck up yo mufucking pride and chase it
Cause when a nigga broke he ain't pose to have patients

[Chorus: x2]
My money looking funny nigga just making it barely shit ain't how it use to be nigga ain't
Fronting the package gotta choke me a bitch outta something I gotta have it I'm on my
Dick dawg gotta make something happen

[Verse 2:]
I don't kno if god trying to punish me or my luck just bad
I don't kno which one of em it is but I need some fucking cash
I rather be in prison broke then out here without a stash
They say when it rains it purs then how will it last
Before I let it rain on me I'm a let a bitch crash
With all black on chie 5 and ske mask
The streets judge off wat u got not wat u had
I took a lost and it hurt me fucked me up bad
It ain't no feeling in the world like loosing ya last
I ain't got no choice I'm fucked up gotta bounce back
Seems like it take forever to get to get it but u can loose it fast
I rather a mufucka vist me while sitting behind a glass

[Chorus: x2]
My money looking funny nigga just making it barely shit ain't how it use to be nigga ain't
Fronting the package gotta choke me a bitch outta something I gotta have it I'm on my
Dick dawg gotta make something happen

[Verse 3:]
The nigga that invented robbing I bet he was broke
Cause when u fucked up out her it ain't no fucking joke
And all bets off when a nigga money low
A nigga willing to take chances he ain't neva took before
And willing to cross a mufucka for the love of the dough
I can't fault nigga cause I done did that shit before
If u gone take it just be ready to play it how it go
It's every nigga for self this shit cut throat
I bet I past me a nigga for he past me tho
For every nigga balling it's a hundred niggas hunting
I don't kno if he told but these yung niggas thuggin
So why u outta balling it's some niggas riding lucky

[Chorus: x2]
My money looking funny nigga just making it barely shit ain't how it use to be nigga ain't
Fronting the package gotta choke me a bitch outta something I gotta have it I'm on my
Dick dawg gotta make something happen---Lyrics submitted by kyshawndre.
