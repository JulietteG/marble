Plies 
[baby if you don't feel good right now 
and yo body hurtin you right now 
you just need a shot of me 
I'm just like medicine] 

(Chorus)[Keri Hilson] 
shawty I'm your insulin 
baby I'm your insulin 
I think ya need 
I think ya need 
I think ya need your medicine 
baby I'm ya insulin 
shawty I'm ya insulin 
I think ya need 
I think ya need 
I think ya need your medicine 
I'll be your prescription 
Come and take a dose of me 
Once you get a dose of me 
You'll think that I'm your medicine 
[shawty you my medicine] ya medicine 
I think I need x3
I think I need my medicine 

[Verse 1] 
one teaspoon of me is something like a pack of blow 
too much of me too fast and you'll overdose 
treat you like a new born baby I'll feed ya slow 
and if I really **** with ya I'll give you a double dose 
I'm ya lil double stack pop me you'll really roll 
nighttime daytime I can give it to ya both 
anytime you want it, I can give it to ya that's fa sho 
keep ya up all night I can be you Nodoz 
need ya prescription filled holla at me let me know 
call me or text me baby when you need some mo 
I give you Becky baby when ya body sore 
this is exclusive you cant buy this in the store 

(Chorus) 
shawty I'm your insulin

I think ya need your medicine 
baby I'm ya insulin 
shawty I'm ya insulin 
I think ya need 
I think ya need 
I think ya need your medicine 
I'll be your prescription 
Come and take a dose of me 
Once you get a dose of me 
You'll think that I'm your medicine 
[shawty you my medicine?] ya medicine 
I think I need

[Verse 2] 
I can shoot you anywhere aint gotta put it in ya veins 
within the first two seconds you will feel the change 
only discomfort that you might feel is good pain 
one side affect of this medicine is butt gain 
a half a dose of me and I promise you wont be the same 
addiction to this medicine is common dont be ashamed 
and if you feel a lil woozy after this just hold my hand 
and I can numb yo whole body just like Novocain 
I can make you come back you can call me cocaine 
and if you take this first dose good Imma up ya range 
on yo prescription it will read Plies name 
the rest of yo life you will not accept no lames 


(Chorus) 
shawty I'm your insulin 
baby I'm your insulin 
I think ya need 
I think ya need 
I think ya need your medicine 
baby I'm ya insulin 
shawty I'm ya insulin 
I think ya need 
I think ya need 
I think ya need your medicine 
I'll be your prescription 
Come and take a dose of me 
Once you get a dose of me 
You'll think that I'm your medicine 
[shawty you my medicine?] ya medicine 
I think I need 
I think I need 
I think I need 
I think I need my medicine 

[Verse 3] 
call me when you feel bad call me on ya sick day 
and I'll swing through and make sure ya fever go away 
I can make you sweat it out, sweat on me its ok 
dont worry bout ya hair gettin messed up its ok 
I'll get it redone for you baby I'll pay 
and if its top notch and it feel good I'll stay 
I drink straight 'nac me no rosay 
you want it say I need my medicine that's all you gotta say 

(Chorus) 
shawty I'm your insulin 
baby I'm your insulin 
I think ya need 
I think ya need 
I think ya need your medicine 
baby I'm ya insulin 
shawty I'm ya insulin 
I think ya need 
I think ya need 
I think ya need your medicine 
I'll be your prescription 
Come and take a dose of me 
Once you get a dose of me 
You'll think that I'm your medicine 
[shawty you my medicine?] ya medicine 
I think I need

I think I need 
I think I need my medicine---Lyrics submitted by Mz..
