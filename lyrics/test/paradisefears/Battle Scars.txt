This is an anthem to the homesick
For the beaten
The lost, the broke, the defeated
A song for the heartsick
For the standby's
Living life in the shadow of a goodbye

Do you remember when we learned how to fly?
We play make believe
We were young and had time on our side
Your stuck on the ground
Got lost, can't be found
Just remember that your still alive

I'll carry you home
No your not alone
Keep marching on
This is worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars

You've had enough
But just don't give up
Stick to your guns
You are worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars
Keep marching on

This is a call to the soldiers
The fighters, the young, the innocent righteous
We've got a little room to grow
Better days are near
Hope is so much stronger than fear

So if you jump kid don't be scared to fall
Well, we'll be kings and queens in this dream
All for one, one for all
You can light up the dark
There's a fire in your heart
Burning brighter than ever before

I'll carry you home
No your not alone
Keep marching on
This is worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars

You've had enough
But just don't give up
Stick to your guns
You are worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars
Keep marching on

On and on
Like we're living on a broken record
Hope is strong
But misery's a little quicker
Sit and we wait and we drown there
Thinking why I bother playing when it's unfair
They say life's a waste
I say they lack believe
They tell me luck will travel
I tell them that's why I've got feet
Left, right
Left, right
Moving along, just the pulse of a heartbeat
This could be the last chance you have to fly
Do you like the ground?
Want it to pass you by?
Then you had it all
When you were just a kid
Do you even remember who you were back then?
What do you want in life?
Would you be twice as strong?
What would you sacrifice?
What are you waiting on?
Don't stop
March on

I'll carry you home
No your not alone
Keep marching on
This is worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars

You've had enough
But just don't give up
Stick to your guns
You are worth fighting for
You know we've all got battle scars
Keep marching on
