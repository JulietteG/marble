Life is getting harder day by day,
And I, 
I don't no what to do,
What to say, yeah. 
And my mind is growing weak,
Every step I take, 
It's uncontrollable,
Now they think i'm fake, yeah.

(CHORUS)
Cos i'm not alone, no no no  x2 
Not alone

And I ,
I get on the train on my own,
and my tired radio,
keeps playing tired tones
And I know that there's not long to go,
Oh when all I want to do is just go home, Yeah Yeah

(CHORUS)

People rip me for the clothes I wear, 
Yeah ay, 
Everyday seems to be the same, 
They just swear, yeah.
They just dont care, 
They just dont care,
They just don't care 

(CHORUS) 

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na no. No no X2

But i'm not alone, La la la la, yeah Yeah, I'm Not alone.---Lyrics submitted by Sally.
