When everything is going wrong
And things are just a little strange
it's been so long you've forgotten how to smile

And overhead the skies are clear
But it still seems to rain on you
And your only friends all have better things to do

[CHORUS]

When your down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When your down and lost along the way
Oh, just tell yourself
Ah, I'll be ok

Things are only getting worse
And you need someone to take the blame
When your lovers gone there's no one to share the pain

Sleeping with the T.V on
and you're lying in an empty bed
All the alcohol in the world would never help me to forget

[CHORUS]

When your down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When your down and lost along the way
Try a little harder
Try your best to make it through the day
Oh, Just tell yourself
Ah, I'll be ok

You're not alone, you're not alone  x3

Oh just tell yourself
Ah, I'll be okay

Won't you tell yourself
Ah, ah

[CHORUS] 

When your down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When your down and lost along the way
Try a little harder
Try your best to make it through the day
Oh, just tell yourself
Ah, I'll be ok

Ah, I'll be ok  x3---Lyrics submitted by Alyssia.
