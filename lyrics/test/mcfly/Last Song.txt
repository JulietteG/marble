The time has come to say goodbye
The sun is setting in the sky
The truth turned out to be a lie it's over, over
Hum yourself a lulaby
This is the end but baby don't you cry

So take away the melody
and all that's left are memories
Of lovers, friends, and enemies
But they're all faded
You may not remember me
I haven't got the strength to carry on!

If this is the last song I'm here to sing
I'm giving it everything I'm giving it all
If this is the last song I'm here to play
I guess it's time to take my curtain call
I'm dying to thank you all I'm dying to thank you all
I'm dying to thank you all I thank you all yeah

So here's to all the lonely hearts 
Cause mine's been ripped and torn apart
A call and now it's getting dark
But I'll be okay
Bury me with my guitar
And all the way to hell I'll play!

If this is the last song I'm here to sing
I'm giving it everything I'm giving it all
If this is the last song I'm here to play
I guess it's time to take my curtain call
I'm dying to thank you all I'm dying to thank you all
I'm dying to thank you all I thank you all yeah

One more song before I've got to go
From the very bottom of my soul
Every single word and every note
I'm pleading let me hear you sing it all once more with feeling 2x

If this is the last song
I'm here to sing
I'm getting it everything
I'm giving it all
If this is the last song 
I'm here to play
I guess it's time to take
My curtain call

If this is the last song
I'm here to sing
I'm giving it everything
I'm giving it all
If this is the last song
I'm here to play
And I guess it's time to say
We thank you all haha---Lyrics submitted by Annika McKinney.
