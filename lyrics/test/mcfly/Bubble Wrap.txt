I wish I could bubble wrap my heart,
in case I fall and break apart.
But I'm not God, I can't change the stars
and I don't know if there's life on Mars.
But I know you've hurt the people that you love
and those who care for you, but I want nothing to do 
with things you're going through.

This is the last time I give up this heart of mine.
I'm telling you that I'm a broken man who's finally realized.
You're standing in moonlight, but you're black on the inside.
Who do you think you are to cry? 
This is good bye.

I'm a little dazed and confused.
Life's a bitch and so are you.
All my days have turned nights,
'cause living without, without, without you in my life.
And you wrote the book on how to bw a liar
and lose all your friends.
Did I mean nothing at all, was I just another ghost that's been in your bed?

This is the last time I give up this heart of mine.
I'm telling you that I'm a broken man who's finally realized
You're standing in moonlight, but you're balck on the inside.
Who do you think you are to cry?
This is good bye.

Turn on the radie Honey, 'cause every single sad song 
you'll be able to relate, this one I dedicate.
Whoa oh! Don't get all emotional baby, you can never talk to me
you're unable to communicate.

This is the last time I give up this heart of mine.
I'm telling you that I'm a broken man who's finally realized.

This is the last time I give up this heart of mine
You're standing in moonlight, but you're black on the inside.
Who do you think you are to cry?
This is goodbye. 

This is good bye...---Lyrics submitted by Elise.
