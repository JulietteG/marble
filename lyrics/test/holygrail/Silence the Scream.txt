60 cities in 66 days and miles of blackness in between
Pluck your eyes out, slit your own throat, you still can't silence that scream
Over sleepless nights you ponder to endless ways to perfect and relive your dark dream
Then the tension builds to the breaking point, the lion leaves the lair to feed

Caught in a landslide you keep holding on
Too late to notice you're already gone

Fell the shadows of the night surround you
Demons you've been running from have found you
Desperation floods your world and drowns you 
Feel the road against your wheels, it grounds you

16 bodies in 66 days, the pattern remains a mystery
Tortured, gagged, and wrapped in plastic bags, to you it never seems obscene
On the quiet nights when you can't hold it down, the filth within must be made clean

Caught in a landslide you keep holding on
Too late to notice you're already gone

Fell the shadows of the night surround you
Demons you've been running from have found you
Desperation floods your world and drowns you 
Feel the road against your wheels, it grounds you

Forever the shadows surround you
The demons of darkness have found you
How do you silence their scream?

Kill by night, sleep by day, and miles of blackness in between
A drifter's life is the only way the monster will remain unseen

Caught in a landslide you keep holding on
Worse than the last time, it's all going wrong
Nothing can save you you're already gone

Fell the shadows of the night surround you
Demons you've been running from have found you
Desperation floods your world and drowns you 
Feel the road against your wheels, it grounds you---Lyrics submitted by Chum.
