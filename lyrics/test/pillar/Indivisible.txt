For all the people that dont understand 
Exactly what it is we have here in this motherland
See the Father's hand started up a master plan
There's been many through the test of time 
take a stand

But had they ran who knows where we would be now
I thank God its something I don't have to think about
Instead my thoughts are on the ones who laid it on the line
KIA gave their lives to let freedom shine

But in the meantime I think of those of your kind
And wonder how it is you get things so messed up inside your mind
just think a second how long its been going on before you
They're the ones who helped you have the right to argue


Stop complaining! Move Along!
Open your eyes see whats going on!
We need to get back to the ways of the days of old
One nation under God Indivisible!!


Chorus:
All the people let me hear you give a holler
In God we trust, In God we trust!!
We stamp it on our penny, nickle, dime, quarter, dollar
In God we trust, In God we trust!!
The People of the nation let me hear you give a holler
In God we trust, In God we trust!!
We stamp it on our penny, nickle, dime, quarter, dollar
In God we trust, In God we trust!!


The other day I saw the news somebody else complaining
They want the motto taken off the Benjamin Franklin
They got a problem with my God and that I believe in it
But they dont got a problem with the money when they spend it

They so offended by 4 words that need no explanation
In GOD we trust the motto of this greatest nation
Not just a model but something we truly believe
If you dont like it you can pack a bag and you can leave

Stop complaining! Move Along!
Open your eyes see whats going on!
We need to get back to the ways of the days of old!
One nation under God indivisible!
