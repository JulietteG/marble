It's not like I'm walking alone
Into the valley of the shadow of death
Stand beside one another
Cause it ain't over yet


And I'd be willing to bet that if we don't back down
You and I'll be the ones that are holding the crown
In the end when it's over we can say well done
But not yet because its just begun


So pick up and follow me because we're the only ones
To fight this thing until we've won
We drive on and don't look back
Doesn't mean we can't learn from our past 


And all the things we might've done wrong
We could've been doing this all along
[Chorus]
Everybody with your fists raised high
Let me hear your battle cry tonight
Stand beside or step aside 
We're on the front lines


Everybody with your fists raised high 
Let me hear your battle cry tonight
Stand beside or step aside 
We're on the front lines


And we'll be carrying on 
Until the day it doesn't matter anymore
Step beside you forgot what this is for
We fight to live we live to fight and tonight you'll hear my battle cry


We live our lives on the front lines
We're not afraid of the fast times
These days have opened up my eyes
And now I see where the threat lies

[Chorus]
Everybody with your fists raised high 
 Let me hear your battle cry tonight
Stand beside or steo aside 
We're on the front lines

Everybody with your fists raised high
Let me hear your battle cry tonight
Stand beside or step aside
We're on the front lines

We've got to lead the way

We've got to lead the way

[Chorus]
Everybody with your fists raised high
Let me hear your batle cry tonight
Stand beside or step aside
We're on the front lines

Everybody with your fists raised high
Let me hear your battle cry tonight
Stand beside or step aside
We're on the front lines

Everybody with your fists raised high stand beside on the frontlines
Everybody with your fists raised high let me hear your battle cry 
Everybody with your fists raised high let me hear your battle cry tonight
Stand beside or step aside we're on the front lines---Lyrics submitted by JR.
