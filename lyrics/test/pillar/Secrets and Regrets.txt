No matter how hard you try to 
You can't make the clock rewind to the moment that you lied to yourself 
It never really mattered how they felt 

Your secrets and regrets are keeping you from going very far 
And you can't let all this get you down and keep you living in the dark 
Cause all you're looking for 
Is love 
You're living in the dark 
You just can't get enough 
Your secrets and regrets 

Your holding on to all this pain 
Can't seem to leave it all behind you 
Tomorrow it'll be today soon 
Don't wait until it's too late to move 

Your secrets and regrets are keeping you from going very far and you can't let this get you down and keep you living in the dark 
You're living in the dark 
You just can't get enough 
Your secrets and regrets 

How many times do you need second chances 
Not everybody gets a another second chance 
(how many times do you need second chances, not everybody gets another...) 

...chance! 
Second chance 

Your secrets and regrets are keeping you from going very far and you can't let all this get you down and keep you living in the dark cause all you're looking for 
Is love 
You're living in the dark 
You just can't get enough 
Your secrets and regrets 

No more secrets 
(no regrets) 

No more secrets 
(no regrets) 

No living in the dark [x4]---
