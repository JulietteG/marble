Reckless youth!

Don't let emotion stop you
Don't start to hesitate
Don't let the fear you have 
Inside you start to resonate

Stop buying lies they sell you
Stop wasting all our time
Start looking for the
Opportunity for us to shine 

If you're afraid to fall
You'll never make the climb

[Chorus]
We are the fearless ones
We are the loaded guns
With nothing left to lose
We are the reckless youth

We are the chosen ones
We'll never have to run
There's nothing left to lose
We are the reckless youth
[Chorus]

Let your fear motivate you
Don't let it get you down
You've got to get up 
Hold your head up high

It may be the only chance we've got
For us to save the day
No time to doubt it now 
Before it gets too late 

We've got to make our move 
'Cause we're the reckless youth

[Chorus]

[2x]
Stop wasting our time 
Let's step to the line 
Like soldiers we fight
To the end of our lives

Let's break the rules 
But don't play the fool
'Cause we are
[2x]

[Chorus 2x]---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
