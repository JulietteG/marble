It's been far too long, we've known all along
This was going on, can't seem to respond to anything, so, we carry on
With our lives, we rewind, we can't find, we deny 
The simple fact that we haven't done anything
Doesn't mean that we can't start offering
Why do we feel so far? It's like we're seeing stars
Why does it seem so hard to wake up now and see who we really are?

So, let go
Don't follow

Where do we go from here?
How did it disappear?
It's hard to see with our own eyes
These times (these lies) 
We've been hypnotized

I think it's time we try to open up our eyes 
Look away from the very thing that's made us cry
We're hypnotized, and you'll see the real me
Luckily, it can't be stopped 
If the tick-tock of life isn't all that you got 
So, come ready or not
Wake up, it's your last shot

So, come to
And redo

Wake up now, wake up now
So, wake up now, wake up now
So, wake up now
It's been far too long
How can we not go wrong?
Now, it's been far too long
How can we not go wrong again?---Lyrics submitted by Alex.
