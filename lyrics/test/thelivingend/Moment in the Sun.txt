Living underneath a gray cloud
When nothing ever changes
I couldn't be any less proud
The heart of this town has grown cold
I'm gonna get out before I get too old
There in a better time than now

'Cause all that we ever hear
Is things will be better come next year
They never, ever
Get any better
And I don't care what you've got in store
Because I'm not gonna wait anymore

This is our moment in the sun
This is our time to run
Because there's nothing left for us here
There's nothing left for us anymore
So please don't be concerned
If we never return
Because there's nothing left for us here
There's nothing left for us here anymore

There's no future for us here in this place
And no one ever changes
They're all living in yesterday
And we never impressed them
Maybe we never will
We're either running too fast
Or standing too still
We made up our minds
There's nothing now to make us stay

'Cause all that we ever hear
Is things will be better come next year
They never, ever
Get any better
And I don't care what you've got in store
Because I'm not gonna wait anymore

This is our moment in the sun
This is our time to run
Because there's nothing left for us here (there's nothing left for us here)
There's nothing left for us anymore
Please don't be concerned
If we never return
Because there's nothing left for us here (there's nothing left for us here)
There's nothing left for us here

Well this is the right place
And this is the right time
For our moment in the sun
Moment in the sun. Go!

And I don't care what you've got in store (don't care what you've got in store)
Because I'm not gonna wait anymore (I'm not gonna wait anymore)
No I don't care what you've got in store (don't care what you've got in store)
Because I'm not gonna wait anymore

This is our moment in the sun
This is our time to run
Because there's nothing left for us here
There's nothing left..

And don't pretend to be concerned
If we never return
Because there's nothing left for us here (there's nothing left for us here)
There's nothing left for us here

You were born here (you were born here)
Will you die here (will you die here)
Because there's nothing left for us here (nothing left for us here)
There's nothing left for us here

You were born here (you were born here)
But will you die here (die here)
Because there's nothing left for us here (nothing left for us here)
There's nothing left for us here

And I don't care what you've got in store
Because I'm not gonna wait around here anymore---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
