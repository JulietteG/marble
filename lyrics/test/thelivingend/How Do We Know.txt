We've been waiting
On the front line
We've been preparing our entire lives
for this day to arrive

And no doubt this will be
Part of our history
We're making our move
and we're breaking out on the grind

Today the new age
We'll rise up
State our case
Throw it down

And after the rain
The only ones that still remain
Standing proud
Separated from the crowd

(How do we know? How do we know?)
Turn on the light
(How do we know? How do we know?)
I need to decide
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Because we may not
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Survive tonight
(How do we know? How do we know?)
But I'll take my chance
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Spare me the romance
(How do we know? How do we know?)
And we'll give it all
(How do we know? How do we know?)
That we can

New information
Coming down the line
But as far as I can tell
It's just the blind leading the blind

I see frustration
Written in the eyes
Of a disaffected race
Being born under a bad sign

Today the new age
We'll rise up
State our case
Throw it down

And after the rain
The only ones that still remain
Standing proud
Separated from the crowd

(How do we know? How do we know?)
Turn on the light
(How do we know? How do we know?)
I need to decide
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Because we may not
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Survive tonight
(How do we know? How do we know?)
But I'll take my chance
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Spare me the romance
(How do we know? How do we know?)
And we'll give it all
(How do we know? How do we know?)
That we can

Today will be the last day
Tomorrow everything will change...

(How do we know? How do we know?)
Turn on the light
(How do we know? How do we know?)
I need to decide
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Because we may not
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Survive tonight
(How do we know? How do we know?)
But I'll take my chance
(How do we know? How do we know?)
Spare me the romance
(How do we know? How do we know?)
And we'll give it all
(How do we know? How do we know?)
That we can

Today will be the last day
Tomorrow everything will change---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
