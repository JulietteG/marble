Diana, the Berlin wall
Even giants can take a fall
George Bush
The bikini wax
Below the belt
Hide the facts
Skase is gone
And Axle's mad
Kaufman was the best we had
John is dead
The Bastard lives
What the hell are we supposed to tell the kids?

Nothing is ever what it seems to be
Living in the 21st century
Life has changed
From everything we knew
All that we've been through
It doesn't make sense to me
Living in the 21st century

Global warming just ain't cool
Too much chlorine in the gene pool
Save the sheep
Clone the whales
Running out of options
Preparing to fail
Genocide
Defacto wife
G8 summit designed for life
Mohammed Ali
Kurt Cobain
There's no such thing as cheap cocaine
Never Again

Nothing is ever what it seems to be
Living in the 21st century
Life has changed
From everything we knew
All that we've been through
It doesn't make sense to me
Living in the 21st century
In the 21st century

Why isn't anyone around?
Why is everybody lying down?
Everyone is shouting but I can't hear a sound

No one wants to act their age
Take a pill
Join the rave
Living fast
Dying young
27 years of too much fun
Vietnam
And the markets crashed
Brian Wilson hide the stash
Making cents of interests rates
And Hefner is the devil incarnate
Devil incarnate

Nothing is ever what it seems to be
Living in the 21st century
Life has changed
From everything we knew
All that we've been through
It doesn't make sense to me
Living in the 21st

Nothing is ever what it seems to be
Living in the 21st century
Life has changed
From everything we knew
All that we've been through
It doesn't make sense to me---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
