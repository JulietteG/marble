Opinions can be fatal
If you're not careful
They can lead you on the right track?
Or stab you in the back?

You say I should know better
That I should just agree
But honey hearts don't come with guarantees
I hate to break it to you
But I'm obviously not who you want me to be

And it's a cowardly act now
I didn't mean to react now
Your mind is under attack
And you're asking yourself, 'why?'

I can't live without the attention
I feel lost, got no direction

I'm waiting for the silence to end now
Waiting for the smoke to clear
Waiting for someone to surrender
Don't you remember how it was last year?

When all of the boys were making their noise
And the girls were trying hard to pretend
We had it all back then
Now we're waiting for the silence to end

Secrets can be hurtful
And the truth can sometimes kill it seems
But be careful what you wish for
Because from over here, the grass doesn't look too green

And it's a cowardly act now
I didn't mean to react now
Your mind is under attack
And you're asking yourself, 'why?'

I can't live without the attention
I feel lost, got no direction

I'm waiting for the silence to end now
Waiting for the smoke to clear
Waiting for someone to surrender
Don't you remember how it was last year?

When all of the boys were making their noise
And the girls were trying hard to pretend
We had it all back then
Now we're waiting for the silence to end

Is there any point shifting the blame?
Is there any point chasing a runaway train?


I can't live without the attention
I feel lost, got no direction

I'm waiting for the silence to end now
Waiting for the smoke to clear
Waiting for someone to surrender
Don't you remember how it was last year?

When all of the boys were making their noise
And the girls were trying hard to pretend
We had it all back then
Now we're waiting for the silence to end

Waiting for the silence to end---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
