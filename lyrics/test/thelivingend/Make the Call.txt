Waiting on the line
You still have the time
Or have you already lost your mind?
Slowly you descend
Closer to the end
Soon you will be walking with the dead
No one will relieve your despair
No one will answer your prayers
You take your own life in your own hands

Waiting, why are you waiting?
Make the call
Waiting, why are you waiting?
Make the call

See the other side
Surrender in your pride
Face yourself and let the truth decide
All that you believed
What you think you see
Only what you make it out to be
No one will relieve your despair
No one will answer your prayers
You take your own life in your own hands

Waiting, why are you waiting?
Make the call
Waiting, why are you waiting?
Make the call---Lyrics submitted by Aaron.
