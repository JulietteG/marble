Joseph was a tin man
Came far across the sea
He came to buy my tin
His nephew came with him
A lad from Galilee

I'd meet them at the quay
They'd always stay with me

"Romans have no sway here"
He always used to say
"At home they kill for fun
Hang men out in the sun
On crosses every day

That is the Roman way
All rebels they will slay

This is a perfect place here
For free men to walk"
On nights with breezes cool
He'd sit by a pool
And his nephew would talk

In the evening they'd walk
And quietly they'd talk

He hated going back there
"I'll return one day" he said
"This is the land I love
And this is where I'll live
When my work is done" he said

"When I'm done with tin and lead
I'll come back here" he said

I hear he's on the marsh now
With a church of wattle daub
He's found his sacred place
All wisdom and grace
And God and his word

He's living undisturbed
Or so I have heard

Yes, Joseph was a tin man
Came far across the sea
He came to buy my tin
His nephew came with him
A lad from Galilee

A prophet, seemingly,
The man from Galilee.---Lyrics submitted by Andrew Zeyfert.
