all i am
who do you think you see when you look at me
is it somebody strong somebody you could admire
and who do you think i am when i take your hand
are you counting on me to fill your dreams and your desires

well...all i am is lonely just like you
all i wanna do is have one dream come through
all i am is having you my heart
hoping to be part of you

who do you think you are standing in the dark
are you waiting for me why can't i reach you from here
oh and how do i get to you won't you let me through
don't you think may be we have something special to be shared

well...all i am is lonely like you
all i wanna do is have one dream come through
all i am is having you my heart
hoping to be part of you

really all i am ..... is want to do
all i wanna do ..... have one dream come through
all i am is having you my heart
and hoping to be part of you.---Lyrics submitted by Naz.
