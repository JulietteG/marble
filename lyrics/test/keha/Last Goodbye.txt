I remember the night,
We first met,
We were so young,
I can't forget,
How you kissed my face,
(Woah, oh-oh-oh),
And you took me home.
(Woah, oh-oh-oh).

I remember the life,
Years ago,
The air mattress,
On the floor.
That was before,
(Woah, oh-oh-oh),
Life took control.

Oh, how we lost our minds,
When we fell in love that night,
I never thought that I,
Would ever leave your side.

Oh, how we lost our minds,
When we fell in love that night,
Promise me you won't cry,
This is our last goodbye.

When I was lost,
I found you.
When I was broke,
You bought me shoes.
You were my first,
(Woah, oh-oh-oh),
And, damn, if this hurts.
(Woah, oh-oh-oh).

Now you've got a girl,
Someone new,
And I can't pretend,
To just be cool.
I can't be your friend,
(Woah, oh-oh-oh),
So this is the end.

Oh, how we lost our minds,
When we fell in love that night,
I never thought that I,
Would ever leave your side.

Oh, how we lost our minds,
(We lost our minds)!
When we fell in love that night,
Promise me you won't cry,
This is our last goodbye.

Na na na, na na na na,
Na na na, na na na na.
Promise me you won't cry,
This is our last goodbye.

Our last goodbye.

Oh, how we lost our minds,
When we fell in love that night,
I never thought that I,
Would ever leave your side.

Oh, how we lost our minds,
(We lost our minds)!
When we fell in love that night,
(Love that night),
Promise me you won't cry,
(Oh), this is our last goodbye.
(Our last goodbye).

Na na na, na na na na,
Na na na, na na na na.
Promise me you won't cry,
This is our last goodbye.

Our last goodbye.---
