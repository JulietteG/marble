Backdoor cracked, we don't need a key
We get in for free, no V.I.P. sleeze
Drink that kool-aid, follow my lead
Now you're one of us, you're coming with me

It's time to kill the lights and shut the dj down (this place about to)
Tonight we're taking over, no one's getting out (this place about to)

Chorus
Blow
Blow
This place about to
Blow
Blow
This place about to
Blow
Blow
This place about to 
Blow
Blow
This place about to

Now what (what) we're taking control
We get what we want, we do what you don't
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick, we're young and we're bored

It's time to lose your mind, and let the crazy out (this place about to)
Tonight we're taking names, cause we don't mess around (this place about to)

Repeat Chorus

Go go go go go
Go insane, throw some glitter, make it rain on em
Now let me see them hanes, let me, let me, see them hanes (2x)

We're taking over
(blow blow blow blow)
Get used to it

Repeat Chorus 

This place about to blow---Lyrics submitted by sean.
