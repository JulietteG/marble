Backstabber (repeat 3x)

Bored, stoned, sitting in your basement
All alone, cause your little conversations
got around, now look at what we all found out
(look at what we, look at what we all found out)

You have got a set of loose lips, twisting stories
All because you're jealous
Now I know exactly what you're all about,
And this is what you're all about..

Girl, your such a backstabber,
Oh girl, you're such a shit talker
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Girl, your such a backstabber,
Run your mouth more than everyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

(Talk Talk Talk talk talk talk)
I'm sick and tired of hearing all about my life,
from other bitches with all of your lies,
wrapped up so tight, so maybe you should shut your mouth shut your mouth
Shut your fucking mouth

Honestly, I think its kinda funny that you waste
your breath talking about me,
Got me feeling kinda special really (so this is what your all about)


Girl, your such a backstabber,
Oh girl, you're such a shit talker
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Girl, your such a backstabber,
Run your mouth more than everyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Katie's just there repping my style,
Damn, Jeanie why you gotta tell the secrets about my sex life?
All I ever did was drive your broke ass around,
Pick you up, take you out,
when your car broke down

Backstabber (3x)

Girl, your such a backstabber,
Oh girl, your such a shit talker,
Everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Girl, your such a backstabber,
(taking and twisting it down your so manipulating .oh.)
Run your mouth more than everyone I've ever known
And everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

talk.talk.talk. Backstabber(3x)
(taking and twisting it down your so manipulating .oh.)
Girl Talk talk
your looking like a lunatic
Everybody knows it (everybody knows it)

Everybody knows yeah...
your looking like a lunatic
and everybody knows yeah..

everybody knows
