Stephen 
Why won't you call me? 
Stephen 
Why won't you call me? 

I saw you 
In your tight ass rocker pants 
You saw me too 
I laughed 
'Cause I was completely trashed 
And I watched your 
Ugly girlfriend 
Sneer across the room 
As if I really care 
That she's here with you 
All I know is... 

Your my object of affection 
My drug of choice 
My sick obsession 

Stephen 
Why won't you call me? 
I'm sitting here waiting 
Why won't you call me? 
Stephen 
I'm feeling pathetic 
I can't take rejection 
Why won't you call me? 

I've got guys 
Waiting in a line 
For me too play 
My evil girly games 
With all their minds 
Just watch me 
Got it down 
To a simple art 
Just bat my Eyes 
Like this 
And there's a broken heart 
But somehow... 

You turn the tables 
What the hell 
I can charm the pants of anyone else 
But you 

Stephen 
Why won't you call me? 
I'm sitting here waiting 
Why won't you call me? 
Stephen 
I'm feeling pathetic 
I can't take rejection 
Why won't you call me? 

Stephen 
I'm thinking' that 
Maybe 
You might think I'm 
Crazy 
Is that why you won't 
Call me 
Steve 
Don't you think I'm 
Pretty 
Do you not 
Love me 
Is that why you won't call me? 

'Cause your my object of affection 
My drug of choice 
My sick obsession 
I want to keep you as my pet to play with 
And hide under my bed forever 

Stephen 
Why won't you call me? 
I'm sitting here waiting 
Why won't you call me? 
Stephen 
I'm feeling pathetic 
I can't take rejection 
Why won't you call me? 

Stephen 
I'll knit you a sweater 
I want to wrap you up in my love 
Forever 
I will never let you go Stephen 
I'll never let go 

Stephen 
Why won't you call me? 
I'm sitting here waiting 
Why won't you call me? 
Stephen 
I'm feeling pathetic 
I can't take rejection 
Why won't you call me?---Lyrics submitted by Morgan.
