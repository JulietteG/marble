(feat. 3OH!3)

Aaaaah
La dee da da
blah blah blah blah blah

Coming out your mouth with your blah blah blah
Zip your lips like a padlock
And meet me in the back with the jack and the jukebox
I dont really care where you live at
Just turn around boy and let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at

Music's up
Listen hot stuff
I'm in love
With this 
song
So just hush
Baby shut up
Heard enough

Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah blah blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah nah nah
Not in the back of my
Ca-a-ar
If you keep talking that
Blah blah blah blah blah

Boy come on get your rocks off
Come put a little love in my glove box
Wanna dance with no pants on?
(Holler)
Meet me in the back with the jack and the jukebox
So cut to the chase kid
'Cause I know you don't care what my middle name is
I wanna be naked
But your wasted

Music's up
Listen hot stuff
I'm in love
With this song
So just hush
Baby shut up
Heard enough

Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah blah blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah nah nah
Not in the back of my
Ca-a-ar
If you keep talking that
Blah blah blah blah blah

You be delayin'
You won't be sayin' some shizz 
You say i'm playin 
I'm never layin' the bitch (dick?)
Sayin' "blah, blah blah" 
Cause I don't care who you are 
In this bar 
It only matters who I is

Stop ta-ta-talking that 
Blah blah blah
Think you'll be getting this
Nah nah nah
Not in the back of my
Ca-a-ar
If you keep talking that
Blah blah blah blah blah

Blah blah blah
Think you'll be getting this
Nah nah nah
Not in the back of my
Ca-a-ar
If you keep talking that
Blah blah blah blah blah

Oh

Blah Blah Blah
Stop talkin
Stop ta-ta-talkin that---Lyrics submitted by amber.
