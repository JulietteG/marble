We were born to,
Break the doors down,
Fight until the end.
It's something that's,
Inside of us, it's how,
We've always been, yeah.

Warrior, -ior, -ior,
Warrior, -ior!
Warrior, -ior, -ior,
Warrior, -ior, ow!

We are the misfits,
We are the bad kids,
We degenerates.
We ain't perfect,
But that's alright.

Love us or hate us,
Nothin' can break us,
Better believe us.
Times, they are,
A-changing tonight.

We don't want to,
Flirt with disaster,
On your ass we'll,
Pounce like a panther.
Cut the bullshit,
Out with a dagger,
With a dagger,
With a dagger.

Do or die we all,
Gonna stay young,
Shoot the lights out,
Like a machine gun.
Think it's time for,
A revolution,
Revolution,
Revolution.

We were born to,
Break the doors down,
Fight until the end, yeah.
It's something that's,
Inside of us, it's how,
We've always been, yeah.

Warrior, -ior, -ior,
Warrior, -ior!
Warrior, -ior, -ior,
Warrior, -ior, ow!

Now this is our time,
Our generation,
And we're impatient.
Animals you ready,
To fight?

Fight for the fuck ups,
Stand up for true love,
We'll never give up.
Live like it's our,
Last night alive.

We don't want to,
Flirt with disaster,
On your ass we'll,
Pounce like a panther.
Cut the bullshit,
Out with a dagger,
With a dagger,
With a dagger.

Do or die we all,
Gonna stay young,
Shoot the lights out,
Like a machine gun.
Think it's time for,
A revolution,
Revolution,
Revolution.

We were born to,
Break the doors down,
Fight until the end, yeah.
It's something that's,
Inside of us, it's how,
We've always been, yeah.

Warrior, -ior, -ior,

Break the doors down,
Fight until the end, yeah.
It's something that's,
Inside of us, it's how,
We've always been, yeah.
