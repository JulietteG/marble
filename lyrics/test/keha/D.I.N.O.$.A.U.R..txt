D.I.N.O.S.A .U R  are a dinosaur
D.I.N.O.S.A. U R  are a Dinosaur
O.L.D.M.A.N You just say old man 
Hitten on me WHAT?! You need a cat scan

Old man why are you staring at me
Mac on me and my friends it is kinda creepy
You should be prowling around the old folks home
Come on dude ... leave us alone

At first we thought it was kinda illin
We thought you were like a billion
And still trying to make a killin
Get back to the meusam

D.I.N.O.S.A U R   a Dinosaur
D.I.N.O.S.A U R a Dinosaur
O.L.D.M.A.N You just say old man 
Hitten on me WHAT?! You need a cat scan

(Hey dinosaur, baby your breath is horrid
Hey dinosaur that is what you are!
Hey carnivore you want my meat I know it
Hey dinosaur that is what you are!)

"Ya your pretty old"

Not long till you are a senior citizen
And you can strut around with that sexy tank of oxygen
Honey your toupee falling to your left side
Get up and go bro 
Oh wait your fossilized HA!

Used to del mame a martini
willnt go away my hippie is in sinking
"Hey" you say "want to come with me"
im about to barf seriously 

D.I.N.O.S.A   U R a Dinosaur
D.I.N.O.S.A U R a Dinosaur
O.L.D.M.A.N You just say old man 
Hitten on me WHAT?! You need a cat scan

(Hey dinosaur, baby your breath is horrid
Hey dinosaur that is what you are!
Hey carnivore you want my meat I know it
Hey dinosaur that is what you are! 
Hey dinosaur, baby your breath is horrid
Hey dinosaur that is what you are!
Hey carnivore you want my meat I know it
Hey dinosaur that is what you are!)

D.I.N.O.S.A U R a Dinosaur
D.I.N.O.S.A U R  a Dinosaur
Thats what you are!
D.I.N.O.S.A U R a Dinosaur
D.I.N.O.S.A U R a Dinosaur
Thats what you are!---Lyrics submitted by elizabeth.
