Oh dont you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said Youre holding back
She said Shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said Oooooh, shut up and dance with me

We were victims of the night
A chemical, physical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and fading light
Oh we were born to get together
Born to get together

She took my heart I dont know how it happened
We took the floor And she said

Oh dont you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said youre holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said Oooooh, shut up and dance with me

A backless dress and some knee-up sneaks
My discoteque, Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest since she looked at me
I knew we were born to be together
Born to be together

She took my heart I dont know how it happened
We took the floor And she said

Oh dont you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said youre holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said Oooooh, shut up and dance with me

(Oh cmon girl)

Deep in her eyes I think I see the future I realize
This is my last chance
She took my arm I dont know how it happened
We took the floor And she said

Oh dont you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me I said youre holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said Oooooh, shut up and dance with me
Dont you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said youre holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said Oooooh, shut up and dance with me
Oooooh, shut up and dance with me
Oooooh, shut up and dance with me---
