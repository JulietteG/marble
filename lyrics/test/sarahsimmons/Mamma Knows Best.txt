Well there is something going down
Like the storm in the sky
I ain't gonna be played by your behavior
How can I trust someone who's lying to me, so

Bow out, go!
Now I said bow out, leave!
I said take your stuff and go,
'Cuz you're not for me
Mama knows best when times get hard
And papa always has a joke to make me laugh
Mama knows best when
I feel down, to bring me up
And always keep my feet on solid ground

See i ain't no old rag doll
That you can pick up and drop,
And all of this inconsistent love
I think it's time that it S.T.O stops

So bow out, go!
Now I said bow out, leave!
I said take your bags and go,
'Cuz you're not for me
Mama knows best when times get hard
And papa always has a joke to make me laugh
Mama knows best when
I feel down, to bring me up
And always keep my feet on solid ground

Just keep the best of ma'
Daddy said to me
Always use humor as your therapy, yeah
Don't ever take life too seriously,
Just do you, 'cuz you do you so perfectly

See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Daddy Daddy knows best
See Mamma Mamma knows...

See Mamma knows best when times get hard
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See Mamma knows best when I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my feet on the ground

See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Daddy Daddy knows best
See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Daddy Daddy knows best
See Mamma Mamma knows best
Yeah, yeaaaaaah! ---
