I build it up I rip it down
I sleep all day and drive around
You take me out another day
On the cold wet road is where I'll stay

I see the fields of hey and grass
I've burnt the trees and lost it all
I don't think I matter much to you
I won't let it leave me blue

I bet all night and lost my ass
I drank some beers and smoked some grass
I wore my boots till blood shown through
I won't let it leave me blue

I don't care what you think
What you eat, smoke, sniff, or drink
You take me out on your cigarette boat
I'll be your friend till the day we die

I see the valley that the rivers cut out
You bash my key I'll kick your mouth
I slept in a ditch or two
I'll never let it leave me blue

I left my heart in a shitty bar
I drove all night and woke up here
I ate canned meat for seven weeks
I won't let it leave me blue

I build it up I'll rip it down
I sleep all day and drive around
You take me out another day
On the cold wet road is where I'll stay

I bet all night and lost my ass
I drank some beers and smoked some grass
I wore my boots till blood shown through
I won't let it leave me blue
I won't let it leave me blue

I drove all night and woke up here---Lyrics submitted by Dick Bass.
