Flat rate amp, suitcase amp
Got a buzz from hell, I can't tell where it comes from
Maybe a ground, I don't know
25 cents, with the brown binding
the chrome after market grill, shines in the sun
like an old harmony

Flat rate, model H3O3B
Harmony, harmony, harmony

45 watts, 3 tubes in-line
it doesn't matter which outlet you chose
there will be buzz, maybe a ground

Flat rate, model H3O3B
Harmony, harmony, harmony

Flat rate, model H3O3B
Harmony, harmony, harmony---Lyrics submitted by Dick Bass.
