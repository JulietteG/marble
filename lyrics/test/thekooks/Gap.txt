So put a spanner in the works of your mind,
It's easier to work, but I don't mind,
You're better in defeat so, just don't try,
To take away all the things so dear in my life.

I have to break down on the corners of the world,
Don't hear this praise on me, I know I don't deserve it,
Want someone else I see, yeah you're leaving right beside me,
And I miss you, and I need you, I do.

But don't go, take my love, I won't let you,
I'm saying please don't go, don't go,
Take my love, I won't let you,
I'm saying please don't go.

Leave your lover now, It's your turn,
And see your mother now, I hope she's OK,
You're better in defeat so, let's not try,
To take away all the things so dear in our lives

I have to break down on the corners of the world,
Don't hear this praise on me, I know I don't deserve it,
Want someone else I see, yeah you're leaving right beside me,
And I miss you, and I need you, I do.

But don't go, take my love, I won't let you,
I'm saying please don't go, don't go,
Take my love, I won't let you,
I'm saying please don't go.

All of my life, trying to understand
All of my life, trying to hold a hand

I have to break down on the corners of this world,
Don't hear this praise on me, I know I don't deserve it,
Want someone else I see, yeah you're leaving right beside me,
And I miss you, and I love you, and that's true---Lyrics submitted by Ana.
