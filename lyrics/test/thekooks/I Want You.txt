Take me back to the place where I
Loved that girl for all time
Why must life just take away
Every good thing one at a time

I want it back
Well yes I want it back
Yes I want you back
Please give it me back
'Cause I want your love

How can I not even cry?
For such a big thing in my life
The pain it takes the part of me
Turn around and say goodbye

I want it back
Well yes I want it back
Yes I want you back
Please give it me back
'Cause I want you

How did you do it females?
It's always you do it angels
You always keep me on the run
So how did you do it angels?
Always you do it females
You always keep me on the run

I want it back
Well yes I want it back
Yes I want you back
Please give it me back
'Cause I want your love
But I can't let myself love you---Lyrics submitted by Tracey.
