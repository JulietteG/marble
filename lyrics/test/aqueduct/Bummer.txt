Well I don't know how I got to here,
But I'm not proud of myself.
I hope it makes it kind of weird,
Cause I know I am nervous.

Well you're the one who straightens, straightens me out
Woah, you're the one who straightens, straightens me out

I think it's unbelievable
That I'm not growing older.
I know its unforgivable
That I'm under the table.

Cause you're the one who breaks and bums me out
Woah you're the one who breaks and bums me out.

I wish you all a lot of luck
I hope you all get fucked
Thats how its gotta end.

Cause I've been living in a rut
That don't amount to much
And that's where I will stay

Well I have got a lot of love
But sometimes I can't show it
I wish I could just express myself
Before I go and blow it now

Woah, you're the one who Straightens, straightens me out
Woah, you're the one who straightens, straightens me out
Woah you're the one who breaks and bums me out
Woah you're the one who breaks and bums me out
