I'm unashamed of my mistakes
I walked the path I had to take
It's made me who I am today
This reign of hate is done
We're gonna take this over now
And we've only just begun

Here I am
This is all of me
I'm not hiding
I'm standing tall for all to see
Here I am
There is nothing bigger
Nothing brighter than a future I see

So if you find it hard to breathe
You can put your faith in me
I'll be the light that leads your way
We are the voice of a generation
So take your chance and don't back down

Here I am
This is all of me
I'm not hiding
I'm standing tall for all to see
Here I am
There is nothing bigger
Nothing brighter than a future I see

Take this chance
Take a stand
Take this chance
Don't back down

Here I am
This is all of me
I'm not hiding
I'm standing tall for all to see
Here I am
There is nothing bigger
Nothing brighter than a future I see

So take this chance
Don't back down
Take a stand
And never let them bring you down
So take this chance
Don't back down
And never let them bring you down---
