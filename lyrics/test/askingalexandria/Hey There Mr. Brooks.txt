Oh! Your back to me!
And the hunger returns!
I told myself I was done for good!
Oh! The memories, of all the pictures burned!
I see them dancing! my heart begins to pound!
I didnt make a sound!
They didnt see me coming!
The lights are left on! The curtains left wide!
One Scream its over!
I Lay them side by side! (Side by side!)
Holding each other!

I'll Be there In The Morning!
With A Smile On My face!
I'll be there in he morning!
To start it all again!

Boy! You caught me red handed!
You got no fucking clue what you just got yourself into!
Panic runs down your leg seeing me kill again!
You just got yourself caught and you don't even know it!
On the drive you get the rush and pull a gun on me!
We make the stop!
It's time to be set free!
Oh! The bullets gone!
I take this spade and slit your throat!
You fall into your grave, I cover up my tracks I'm done!
I wont kill again!
I said that's it I'm done!

I'll Be there In The Morning!
With a Smile on My face!
I'll be there in the morning!
To start it all again!

[x2]
No! she's daddy's little girl!
She wasn't meant to be another me!
But it's the scissors to my throat!
To my fucking throat!---Lyrics submitted by Kayla Swisher.
