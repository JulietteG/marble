Oh My God!
Oh My God!
If only he knew!
If only he knew!
If only he knew about the world without the bullshit and the lies!
We could've saved him!
They could've saved me!
But instead I'm here, drowning in my own fucking mind!
And I'll be damned if you're the death of me!

Blood and ink stain the walls!
Silently, with bloodied knuckles I carry on!
Hoping it's not too wrong!
You said the nights were far too long!
"Honey, it's just the start of it."

Oh My God!
If only he knew!
Oh My God!
If only he knew!
(if only he knew!)
If only he knew!

Just stand up and scream!
The (tainted) clock is counting down!
(Faster and Fast-)
You gave in to me!
Would you say the nights are far too long now?
(Faster and Faster and Fast-)

Oh My God!
Oh My Fucking God!

The tears that stain my cheek, must make me look weak!
I wear them proudly.
I wear them proud-

Just stand up and scream!
The (tainted)clock is counting down!
(Faster and Fast-)
You gave in to me!
Would you say the nights are far too long now?
(Faster and Faster and Fast-)

Your Knife, My Back!
My Gun, Your Head!
Your Knife, My Back!
My Gun, Your Head!

You need a doctor baby?
You Scared?
You Need a doctor baby?
You scared?
You Need a Doctor baby?
You scared!?
You Need a Doctor baby!?
YOU....SCARED!?
YOU SCARED!?
YOU SCARED!?
Ya!
You Need a Doctor baby!?
You Scared!?
You Need a Doctor baby!?
You Scared!?
You Need a Doctor baby!?
You need a Doctor baby!?
You Scared!?---Lyrics submitted by Matt B.
