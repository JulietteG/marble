You walked out so many times
And left me with a worried mind
Confused alone, not knowing what to do

Then you come back and I forgive
And heartaches end but memories live
Each time I turn a lighter shade of blue

Cause I don't hurt the way the way I used to hurt
Don't cry the way I used to cry
Could it be a sign I'm gettin' over you

There'll come a day, it won't be long
You'll come back and find me gone
Each time I turn a lighter shade of blue

I don't hurt the way I used to hurt
Don't cry the way I used to cry
Could it be a sign I'm gettin' over you

There'll come a day, it won't be long
You'll come back and find me gone
Each time I turn a lighter shade of blue---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
