I must make up my mind today
What to have, what to hold
A poor man's roses, are a rich man's gold
One's as wealthy as a king in a palace
Though he's callous and cold
He may learn to give his heart for love
Instead of buying it with gold

Then the poor man's roses
And the thrill when we kiss
Will be memories of paradise, that I'll never miss
And yet hand that brings the rose tonight 
Is the hand I will hold
For the rose of love means more to me
More than any rich man's gold

Then the poor man's roses
And the thrill when we kiss
Will be memories of paradise, that I'll never miss
And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight
Is the hand I will hold
For the rose of love means more to me
Than any rich man's gold---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
