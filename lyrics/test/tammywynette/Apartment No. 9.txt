Just follow the stairway
To this lonely world of mine
You'll find me waitin' here 
In Apartment number nine

Not so very long ago
You walked away from me
And after all the plans we made
You decided to be free

Loneliness surrounds me
Without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine 
In Apartment number nine

I keep waiting in this lonely room
JUst in case you change your mind
You'll find me waitin' here
In Apartment number nine

Loneliness surrounds me
Without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine
In Apartment number nine

No the sun will never shine
In Apartment number nine---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
