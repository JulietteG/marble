I've come back to say I love you one more time
I've come back to try and tell you one last time
When I was here before you were so unkind
So I've come back to say I love you one more time

The home town team was losing 9-3
An angry crowd was yelling kill the referee
A strange dressed man sat staring at the fans
Got up and slowly made his way to the announcement stand
The announcer asked the man what's on your mind
Do you wear that silly robe and sandals all the time
As a tear rolled down the strangers cheek
He walked up to the microphone and started to speak

I've come back to say I love you one more time
I've come back to try and tell you one last time
When I was here before you were so unkind
So I've come back to say I love you one more time

Half way around the world that very day
A young boy was hit by a speeding car that quickly drove away
As the little boy lay dead there on the street
The bearded man leaned over and kissed the small child's cheek
Then the little boy got up and as he started back to play
The stranger held him close and said I love you
Be glad and be on your way
The father of the boy just happened by
Without asking any questions he let out a cry
Hey crazy man you leave my son alone
In a fighting rage he beat the man 'til his life was almost gone
Then he called the law and they took the bearded man away
But the next morning when they unlocked the prisoner's door, 
The stranger wasn't there anymore
But on the wall were some words that read

I've come back to say I love you one more time
I've come back to try and tell you one last time
When I was here before you were so unkind
So I've come back to say I love you more time
I've come back to say I love you one last time.---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
