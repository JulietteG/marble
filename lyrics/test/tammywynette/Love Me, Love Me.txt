I've searched so long for love and understanding
Someone to share my dreams as I grow old
And now that I found you and have my arms around you
I don't ever intend to let you go

So darling love me, love me
That's all that I ask of you
Love me, love me
And I'll give all my love to you

You're lovelier then all the words in music
To all the songs the world will ever sing
And with you to walk beside me
No clouds will ever hide me from the sunshine that just one smile can bring

So darling love me, love me
That's all I ask of you
Love me, love me
And  I'll my love to you---Lyrics submitted by Mariah Ring.
