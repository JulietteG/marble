(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me)
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom) Cut it
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me)
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom)

Let me tell you, I'm vicious
Not pass-aggressive
I got my finger on my pulse, staring straight into a hole and I'ma get it
And I'm a savage
It's automatic
I got a way of making noise, the power to destroy with no static

Now victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten, just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord

(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me) Cut the cord
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom)

You gotta feel courage
Embrace possession
If it was easier to shatter everything that ever mattered
But it's not, because it's your obsession
Be a fighter, backbone, desire
Complicated and it stings, but we both know what it means
And it's time to get real and inspired

Now victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten, just count to ten, just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord

Cut it
Cut it

Now victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten, just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord

(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me) Cut the cord
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me, me, me)---
