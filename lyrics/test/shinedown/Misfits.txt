Staring back in time
The two of us intertwined
And your black boots
Walking fast next to mine

We were chasing the thunder inside the storm
Running so wild outside the norm
And what we made
The two of us against the grain

Come out, come out, wherever you are
I know you're there, I know you are

They called us crazy cuz we never fit in
We never thought of keeping up with their trends
It didn't matter that we weren't on the list
Cause we were misfits, we were misfits

Staying up all night
Drinking more than we should
Getting way too high
When the sun came through
I watched you laugh
I saw you cry

Cuz the world has a way of tearing you down
Keeps you tied to the surface
Paints you up like a clown
But I'm right here
Day after day, year after year

Come out, come out, wherever you are
I know you're there, I know you are

They called us crazy cuz we never fit in
We never thought of keeping up with their trends
It didn't matter that we weren't on the list
Cause we were misfits, we were misfits

And after all we never played by the rules
We broke the mold and found our own kind of cool
It didn't matter that we weren't on the list
Cause we were misfits, we were misfits

Don't wait up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up
We're long gone

They called us crazy cuz we never fit in
We never thought of keeping up with their trends
It didn't matter that we weren't on the list
Cause we were misfits
We were misfits
And after all we never played by the rules
We broke the mould and found our own kind of cool
It didn't matter that we weren't on the list
Cause we were misfits, we were misfits
Don't wait up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up
We're long gone---
