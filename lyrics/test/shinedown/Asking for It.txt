Can I have a moment of your time?
Just a single second so you see that indeed we'll be leaving you behind,
before I cross that line
Turn it up so you can hear the bells crashing through the
clouds as it rain down the drain
That we know all too well, it's a living hell

Careful what you say and who you say and who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say you it to
Baby you talked too much and you were asking for it,
asking for it, asking for it
You can blame bad luck but you were asking for it,
asking for it, asking for it
When all is said and done, you need to tie your tongue
Cause when you spit on everyone
You were arguing and now you're asking for it, asking for it, asking

Caught up in the gutter once again
Crashing through the mud, throwing lies,
cutting ties until the sidewalk ends
And the truth begins
Power through the point of no return
Famously arranged all the same I hope you
change if that world is gonna turn
It's not my concern

Careful what you say and who you say and who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say you it to
Baby you talked too much and you were asking for it,
asking for it, asking for it
You can blame bad luck but you were asking for it,
asking for it, asking for it
When all is said and done, you need to tie your tongue
Cause when you spit on everyone
You were arguing and now you're asking for it, asking for it, asking

You are, you are, you are, you are, you are asking for it
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are asking for it

Careful what you say and who you say and who you say it to
Careful what you say and who you say you it to
Baby you talked too much and you were asking for it,
asking for it, asking for it
You can blame bad luck but you were asking for it,
asking for it, asking for it
When all is said and done, you need to tie your tongue
Cause when you spit on everyone
You were arguing and now you're asking for it, asking for it, asking

You know you're asking for it, asking for it.
You know you're asking for it, asking!---
