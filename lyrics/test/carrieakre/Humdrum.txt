Belle looks down, reflecting again
on what her life has become;
She's worked hard to garner 
a husband, a home,
and now, we're sure she's alone.

And it's: oh-oh, sorry, 
oh, how sad,
oh, sad.
Yes it's: oh-oh, sorry,
oh, how sad,
oh, sad.

She cries, "I can't make it alone, [hey hey hey]
'cause I fear is for my life
here on my own."

[hmmm]

Beauty lies so far from her heart,
it's an ugly sight to behold,
and now once in a while
she takes out a mirror
to stare and look for a soul.

And it's: oh-oh, sorry, 
oh, how sad,
oh, sad.
Yes it's: oh-oh, sorry,
oh, how sad,
oh, sad.

She cries, "I can't make it alone, [hey hey hey]
'cause I fear is for my life
here on my own."

"Yes, and I'm never goin' back to where I'm from, [hey yeah]
back to that place we all know is hum-drum."

And pretty the face that she's wearing.
What she's taking, I was preparing,
Just so she can be somehow perfect, perfect.

And yes, a price was paid,
and although best plans were laid,
and lonely is in line so, 
and by this she stands and stays. [hey hey hey]

She cries, "I can't make it alone, [hey hey hey]
'cause I fear is for my life
here on my own."

"Yes, and I'm never goin' back to where I'm from, [hey yeah]
back to that place we all know is hum-drum."

Perfect, perfect...---Lyrics submitted by kylea blue.
