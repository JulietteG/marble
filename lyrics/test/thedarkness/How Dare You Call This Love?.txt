All I wanna do is spend a little time with you,
But you're so young it's obscene
I'll just keep biding my time until you put your little hand in mine
Boy I can't wait for the day when you finally turn 16

There are so many rats on a sinking ship,
There's so much of you, I can't wait
To get to grips, when your halo slips,
Ow!

"How dare you call this love?"
Ooh, that's what they say
It's that urge I've got to fight
"How dare you call this love?
Why it flies in the face of all that is good and is right"

Yeah

You've got it all, and you're always my first port of call
This is the happiest I've ever been
And I know I should wait,
But you lay it all out on a plate
And I'm just a pawn in your paws when the laws of nature intervene

There are so many rats on a sinking ship,
There's so much of you, I can't wait
To get to grips, when your halo slips,
Ow!

"How dare you call this love?"
Ooh, that's what they say
It's that urge I've got to fight, ow
"How dare you call this love,
When it flies in the face of all that is good and is right?"

Yeah

Ah-ah-gow!
Yeah
Keep it moving!
Uh...

"How dare you call this love?"
Ooh, that's what they say
It's that urge I've got to fight, ow
"How dare you call this love?
Why it flies in the face of all that is good and is right"

Yeaaaaaaaah!("How dare you call this love?")
Ooh, that's what they say
It's that urge I've got to fight,
Wanna know, wanna know
Want to face my girl, yeah
'Cuz it flies in the face of all that is good and is right
Yeaaaaaaaah!---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
