You lift me up 
and knock me down 
I'm never sure just what to feel when you're around 
I speak my heart 
but don't know why 
cause you don't never really say what's on you mind 

It's like 
I'm walking on broken glass 
I wanna know but I don't wanna ask 

So say you love me 
or say you need me 
Don't let the silence 
do the talking 
Just say you want me 
or you don't need me 
Don't let the silence 
do the talking 

It's killing me 
(love in silence) 
It's killing me 
(love in silence) 
It's killing me 
(love in silence) 

You let me in 
But then sometimes 
your empty eyes just make me feel so cold inside 
when I'm with you 
It's like rolling dice 
Don't know where or how you're gonna make me cry 

So say you love me 
or say you need me 
Don't let the silence 
do the talking 
Just say you want me 
or you don't need me 
Don't let the silence 
do the talking 

It's killing me 
(love in silence) 
It's killing me, yeah 
(love in silence) 
Wooooo 
(love in silence) 

It's like 
I'm (I'm) walking on (walking on) broken glass 
I wanna know but I don't wanna ask 

'Cause once you say it 
you can't take it back 
And this the end and please just fake it fast 

so say you love me 
or say you need me 
don't let the silence (ooohhhh) 
do the talking 
just say you want me (say you want me) 
or you don't need me (but you don't want me) 
don't let the silence 
do the talking 

Wooooooh 
(love in silence) 

You lift me up 
and knock me down 
I'm never sure just what to feel when you're around
