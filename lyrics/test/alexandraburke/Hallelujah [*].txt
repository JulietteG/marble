I heard there was a secret chord that david played and it pleased the lord but you dont really care for you do yah....
Well it goes like this the fourth the fifth the minor fall and the major lift the baffled king composing hallalujah
Hallalujah hallalujah hallalujah hallalujah.................

Your faith was strong but you needed proof you saw her bathing on the roof her beauty and the moonlight overthrew yahh...
She tied you to her kitchen chair she broke your throne and she cut your hair and from your lips she drew the hallalujah
Hallalujah hallalujah hallalujah hallalujah.................

Maybe theres a god above but all i've ever learnt from love is how to shoot somebody who outdrew yah.....
Its not a cry that you hear at night its not someone who sees the light its a cold and its a broke hallalujah....................

Hallalujah hallalujah hallalujah.................---Lyrics submitted by bethany.
