He like to frequent this club down up on 36th
where pimps and thangs like 2 hang outside and cuss for kicks

Now talking 2 no one in particular, they say "the baddest I am tonight"
You see 4 letter words are seldom heard with such dignity and bite.
Now all the poets and all the part time singers, 
see they always, always, always hang inside
live music from a band plays a song called "Soul Psychodelicide"...
Now this particular song is a year long and had been playin'
for months and months and months when he walked into the place.
But no one seemed to care, an introverted this-is-it look on most of their faces.
And up on the mic repeating 2 words, 2 simple words, over and over again
was this woman he had never noticed before he lost himself in the
articulated manner in which she said them.
Now these 2 words, a little bit behind the beat.
I mean just enough behind the beat 2 turn u on.
4 everytime she said the words another one of his doubts were gone.

Now, you have to understand that his di-, his dilemma was should he try 2 rap with her or should he stand and stare?
You see, no one else was watching her, she did not seem 2 care.
So over and over and over and over, she said the words til he could take no more...
So then he gently grabbed her by the hand 
and then he gently dragged her from the stage
and together like fools they ran, together like fools they ran through the back door...
In the alley over by the curb he looked in her eyes and said, "Sweet, sweet, sweet mama can you please, please, please tell me what's your name?"
But she only said the words over and over and over and over again until it started to rain...
Now these, these 2 words they fall in between the drops, the drops and the sweet, sweet moans of his condition...
For you see, holding someone is truly believing that there's joy... in repetition....

There's joy in repetition....

There's joy in repetition....

... and the two words she repeated over and over... 
were the simple, monosyllabic words that you may have heard before,
she just simply said over... and over... 

Two words..............................

"love....................... 

me........................."
 That's right. She said,
"love........ me."---Lyrics submitted by Dell Shepherd.
