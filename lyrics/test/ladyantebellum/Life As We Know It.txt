(Verse)
I know the road you know aint quite the way you planned it
But the twists and turns are all part of the magic
And believe me youll get through it
Youll see

(Chorus)
So dont be afraid
Of the things you cannot change
As the sun surely follows the rain
I believe that you cant try to lead or control it
Cause thats just life as we know it

(Verse)
Well I dont know much but in life theres all these reasons
And beauty lies in the young child, thats believing
You know love is all we feel and need
To breathe

(Chorus)
So dont be afraid
Of the things you cannot change
As the sun surely follows the rain
I believe that you cant try to lead or control it
Cause thats just life as we know it

(Bridge)
Oh it will pass you by so fast
So dont let it go
Cause only love will last
Long after youre gone

(Chorus)
So dont be afraid
Of the things you cannot change
As the sun surely follows the rain
I believe that you cant try to lead or control it
Cause thats just life as we know it

Life as we know it
Life as we know it---
