Seems I was walking in the wrong direction
I barely recognized my own reflection
Oh scared of love but scared of life alone
Seems Ive been playing on the safe side baby
Building walls around my heart to save me
Oh but its time for me to let it go.

Im ready to feel now
No longer am I afraid of the fall down
It must be time to move on now
Without the fear of how it might end
I guess Im ready to love again

Just when you think that love will never find you
Youve run away but still its right behind you
Its just something that we cant control

Im ready to feel now
No longer am I afraid of the fall down
It must be time to move on now
Without the fear of how it might end
I guess Im ready to love again

So come and find me
Ill be waiting up for you
Ill be holding out for you tonight.

Im ready to feel now
No longer am I afraid of the fall down
It must be time to move on now
Without the fear of how it might end
I guess Im ready to love again---Lyrics submitted by Kimberly.
