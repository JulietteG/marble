Right theres the high-school where we met
Wed sneak out back for a couple kisses and a cigarette
And that parking lot was our first date
And her momma slammed the door when I dropped her off too late

Shes gone
Chasing that highway wind
Shes gone
She aint coming back again

This aint nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
These streets are only bring me down
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

We sat down on those courthouse steps
Fourth of july those fireworks over our heads
And theyd ring the bells of that little church
No there aint nowhere I can look that doesnt hurt

Shes gone
But I still feel her on my skin
Shes gone
But she aint coming back again

This aint nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
These streets are only bring me down
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

I can erase the memories
And I cant burn the whole place down

No this aint nothing
This aint nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
To hell if Im sticking around
This aint nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

Oh yeah
Out of this goodbye town
Im out of this town
So out of this town

Oo ooo oo ooooooooo
Youll be just a memory in the back of my mind
Youll be just a memory yeah
Oh somewhere in the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
One day youre gonna look back at what we had
You gonna think of me
You gonna think of me
When Im long gone
Ill be long gone---
