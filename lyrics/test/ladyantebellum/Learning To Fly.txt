I started out on a dirty road
I started out all alone
The sun went down as I crossed the hill
The town lit up and the world got still

Im learnin' to fly (learnin' to fly)
But I aint got wings
Comin down (learnin' to fly) is the hardest thing

The good ol' days may not return
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

I'm learning to fly (learnin' to fly),
But I ain't got wings
Coming down (learnin to fly) is the hardest thing


[ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/learning-to-fly-lyrics-lady-antebellum.html ]

Well some say life will beat you down
Break your heart, it'll steal your crown
So I've started out, for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there

I'm learning to fly, (learnin' to fly) around the clouds,
But what goes up (learnin' to fly) must come down,
Must come down but..

I'm learning to fly, (learnin' to fly)
But I ain't got wings
Coming down (learnin' to fly)
Is the hardest thing, hardest thing, yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
