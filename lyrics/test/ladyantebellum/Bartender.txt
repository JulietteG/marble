8 oclock on Friday night Im still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying come on, it aint worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now theres only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
Kiss the past goodbye

What Im really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Til I dont remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights

Hey bartender pour em hot tonight
Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Tonight Ill let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me round and let em invite a couple more
But before it goes too far
Ill let me down easy
Cause tonight its all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

What Im really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Til I dont remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights

Hey bartender pour em hot tonight
Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

Im feeling that close
Im ready to rock
Aint no way Im gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
Im coming in hot

Hey bartender
What Im really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Til I dont remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights

Hey bartender pour em hot tonight
Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it til his memory fades away
Hey bartender ---
