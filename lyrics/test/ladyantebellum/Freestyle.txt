We gonna do this thing?
Well, come on then!

River road Chevy van
Share a classic coke and rub it on the floor both feet
Knock 'em all, coming out the speakers
Spilling on the t-shorts
Getting loud like I'm standing in the bleachers
Gray band tie, swing peeling of her blue jeans
Skinny deep sugar, fish a couple of new things

Hey, it ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock 'n' roll, hallelujah
Throw your hands up high
Let the speed remove your pain
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school, ABC style
Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle

Summer jam mixtape, vodka and a lemonade
Alright, alright
White vinyl, tripsy revival
Traveling through the middle of the bell the revival
Hula girl grass skirt shaking on the dashboard
Where we're going we don't need no passport

Hey, it ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock 'n' roll, hallelujah
Throw your hands up high
Let the speed remove your pain
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school, ABC style
Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle

Oh, some of us are locked away
She still likes to dance
We all wake up with the same stamp on our hands
Counting stars, counting cars
We're just counting miles
Do it in freestyle
You style, me style
Ain't gotta win to be child

Hey, it ain't nothing wrong
Just making it up as we go along
Find a little rock 'n' roll, hallelujah
Throw your hands up high
Let the speed remove your pain
Singing hey, hey, hey
We can do it old school, ABC style
Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle
Oh, you can count it all, baby 1, 2, 3, child
Maybe we can go a little wild and freestyle---
