M:
Everybody keeps telling me I'm such a lucky man
Lookin' at you standing there, I know I am.
Barefoot beauty with eyes that blue,
Sunshine sure looks good on you, I swear.

F:
Oh, I can't believe I finally found ya baby.
Happy ever after, after all this time.
Oh, there's gonna be some up and downs,
but with you to wrap my arms around I'm fine.

Both:
So baby, Hold on tight.
And don't let go!
Hold on to the love we're makin',
'Cause baby when the ground starts shakin'
you gotta know, when you got a good thing.

M:
You know you keep bringin' out the best in me,
And I need you now, even more than the air I breathe.

F:
You can make me laugh when I want to cry.
This will last forever, I just know.

M: 
I  know!

Both:
So baby, Hold on tight.
And don't let go!
Hold on to the love we're makin',
'Cause baby when the ground starts shakin'
you gotta know, when you got a good thing.

We got a good thing, baby!
Whoa!

So Hold on tight.
Baby, don't let go!
Hold on to the love we're makin',
'Cause baby when the ground starts shakin'
you gotta know, 

F:
oh, You gotta know,

M:
Oh, You gotta know,

F: 
You gotta know.

Both:
when you got a good thing.

M:
We got a good thing Baby.

Both: 
Whoa. (5Xs)---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.
