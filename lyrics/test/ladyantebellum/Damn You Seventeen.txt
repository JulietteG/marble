I still smell the smoke, I still taste the Crown
I still feel the vinyl of the backseat
With the windows halfway down
Yeah, I still hear "Pour Some Sugar On Me" in the tape deck
With both of us singing along
And I still hear me saying, "Baby, not yet, not yet"

We talk about our memory
Damn, girl, you put a few on me, on me

Love pulled out like a limo onto the highway after the prom
Time ran down like a scoreboard on the last hail mary bomb
And my heart's still stuck at a stoplight
With you sitting there next to me
And the red light won't turn green
Yeah, it won't turn green
Damn you, seventeen
Damn you, seventeen

I still smell your hair, I still taste the salt
Mixed with the cherry on your lips
Afraid your momma might come home
I still see all of your vintage rock and roll t-shirts
Hanging on your closet door
Back when we really didn't know what we were
What we were

We talk about our heartache
I'm still wearing out the replay, replay

Love pulled out like a limo onto the highway after the prom
Time ran down like a scoreboard on the last hail mary bomb
And my heart's still stuck at a stoplight
With you sitting there next to me
And the red light won't turn green
Yeah, it won't turn green
Damn you, seventeen
Damn you, seventeen

Well, I want to call
But I bet your number's changed a couple times
A couple towns ago, but I can't let you go

Love pulled out like a limo onto the highway after the prom
Time ran down like a scoreboard on the last hail mary bomb
And my heart's still stuck at a stoplight
With you sitting there next to me
And the red light won't turn green
No, it won't turn green
Damn you, seventeen
Damn you, seventeen ---
