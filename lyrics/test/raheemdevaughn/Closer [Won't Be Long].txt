If this aint perfect timing, must be telepathy
I was just anticipating, that youd be calling me
And Id be getting closer, as simple as jumping in the ride (Closer)
And approaching your block (Closer)
When my key hits the lock and Im in (Closer)
So it wont be long now ...until we meet again

Till our palms are sweating hand in hand, till were hot and both need a ceiling fanwont be long now

Till we challenge time and try to meet the sun
Until you recognize that Im your only one
Until we make a baby girl or a son it wont be long now

Ill take my tongue to where you, you might feel like a wet dream
And on my way approaching, Ill think of new things we can do
(some oil, some fruitsome chocolates, Im getting Closer)
In case you dont hear me Ima say it one mo timeCloser
As sure as my name is Raheem yeah..oh, Closer
Oh- On my life on the red, black, and green, Closer
I swear it wont be long nowbaby till we meet again

Till our palms are sweating hand in hand, till were hot and both need a ceiling fanwont be long now

Till we challenge time and try to meet the sun
Until you recognize why Im your only one
Till we make a baby girl or a beautiful son it wont be long now

Baby till we meet again
Till were sweating hand in hand, till were hot and both need a ceiling fanwont be long now

Till we challenge time and try to greet the sun
Until you clench my back and whats done is done
And until I plant the seed and I feel you ***
It wont be long now

And youll feel the earth, aligning and shifting
While I am giving you my all
I wanna take you to a place (take my hand, lets go) where the water never runs dry and beauty never dies (yeah..time flies, I wanna make love)


Baby till we meet again
Till our palms are sweating hand in hand, till were hot and both need a ceiling fanwont be long now

Till we challenge time and try to reach the sun
Until you recognize why Im the only one
Until we make a girl or a baby son
It wont be long now---Lyrics submitted by Zari.
