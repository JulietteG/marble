He looked down into her blue eyes, and said
"Say a prayer for me". She
Threw her arms around him, whispered
"God will keep us free".
They could hear the riders comin', He said
"This is my last fight...If they
Take me back to Texas, they won't
Take me back a-live.

There were seven Spanish angels, at the
Altar of the sun.
They were prayin' for the lovers, in the
Valley of the gun.
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven spanish angels, took a-nother
Angel home.

She reached down and picked the gun up,
That lay smokin in his hand.
She said, "Father please forgive me;
I can't make it without my man."
And she knew the gun was empty,
And she knew she couldn't win,
But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again.

There were seven Spanish angels, at the
Altar of the sun.
They were prayin' for the lovers, in the
Valley of the gun.
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven spanish angels, took a-nother
Angel home.---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
