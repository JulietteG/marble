A hard fall on a rough path.
Her body, her betrayer, she spoke as she fought back,
"To lose is to lose, but I'll never die for you."

"Now I'm saved with the flare, the spark, the alarm!"

"I'm not alone in this fight, there's no excuse for the trite."

(Not one)

Would they believe the things we've done?
This gives my sleepless nights a reason to be home.
(a reason to be home)

They're crying out as they make their way down.
In the midst of all this drowning, what will come of us?

Swing now hard the reveille sounds!
(Was it worth it?)

Swing now hard the reveille sounds!
(Was it worth it?)

Swing now hard the reveille sounds!
(Was it worth it?)

Swing now hard the reveille sounds!
(Was it worth it?)

(Whoa!)

They set the fire with eyes so wide.
(A sudden sense of comfort washed over them at once.)

They're crying out as they make their way down, in the midst of it...
(What became?)

(Whoa!)

Swing, now hard!

Swing, now hard!

Swing, now hard!

Swing, now hard!

(Oh yea!)
Goddamn!

(With eyes so wide)
Love, love is all there was!

(With eyes so wide)
Love, love is all there was!
