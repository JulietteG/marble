Short black dress falls off her shoulders, we're on top of the world.
The evening air's intoxicating... We're on top of the world!

We're on top of it!

We're on top of it!

Drink away, drown away your problems,
just move on...
Drink away, drown away your problems,
just move on...

All you can swallow is still just a mouthful.

Ready! Let's take our time...
Bleed out our insides!
Ready! Let's take our time...
Bleed out our insides!
(Ready! Let's take our time... Bleed out our insides!)
(Ready! Let's take our time... Bleed out our insides!)

(One cut from this knife and we'll bleed out our insides)

Your eyes gut me like the sharpest of knives.
Your eyes gut me like the sharpest of knives..
Your eyes gut me like the sharpest of knives...
Your eyes gut me like the sharpest of knives....

(You looked so much better then)
(You looked so much better then)
(You looked so much better then)

You looked so much better then!

(Woo!)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
