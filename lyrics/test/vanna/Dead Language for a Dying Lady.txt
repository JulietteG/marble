As her insides are screaming, "let me out!"
She speaks as if someone's in the room with her.

(Someone sits quietly on the ceiling tile)

Still facing the corner with eyes gouged out,
these tears of blood fall, for blood is all she's crying now.

Her heart beats on,
She's just not giving up yet.
Though blinded by the devil's touch.
She rises above him.

She races towards the light,
her heart beats on.

She stares death straight in the face; heart beats on.
These tears of blood fall, for blood is all she's crying now.

As he cuts into her chest,
her heart beats on.

She's just not giving up yet,
rhough blinded by the devil's touch.

She rises above him
(Rise above)

She floats towards the light;
The darkness recedes.
(Let me out, let me live again!")

In this most desperate hour
(She cries)

In this crowded room
In this crowded room
In this crowded room (With an empty view)
In this crowded room

Save your goodbyes,
We all know it's not the end.---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
