Let's run like kids at play, hold our breath.
Until our hearts stop beating.
(hearts stop beating)

Let's run like kids at play, hold our breath.
Until our hearts stop beating.
(hearts stop beating)

Let's run like kids at play, hold our breath.
Until our hearts stop beating.
(hearts stop beating)

Let my last breath be something I hold dear.

(Let my, let my last breath)

Let my, let my last breath be something I hold!

(Goddamn!)

Something I hold to myself.
Keep locked away inside.

I tried my best, but is it enough?

Hold to myself, keep locked away inside.
I tried my best, but is it enough?

(I tried my best, but is it enough?)
But is it enough?

I tried my best!

Hold your breath!
(Is it enough?)

Hold your breath!
(Is it enough?)

Hold your breath!
(Is it enough?)

Hold your breath!
(Is it enough?)

Hold your breath!
(Is it enough?)

(Hold your breath!)

Is it enough!---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
