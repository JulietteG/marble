I am no stanger to lost
And I've seen more than my eyes can bare
We are both love and hate
Lead by hearts, and taken like dust to the air
Our paths my crawl like vines
Held high, and left the for wind to taste
But our names mean nothing if we fail
And we will run ourselves with or without you
Make the earth shake
We will, make the earth shake
Make the earth
Make the earth
Make the earth shake---Lyrics submitted by Balls.
