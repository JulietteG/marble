Let's make this happen!
Let's lay it all down now.
You've been taken for granted, so let me show you around.

(You'll never see the light of day again)

The walls were crawling with your insides.
The walls were crawling with your insides!

(You'll never see the light of day again)

Your heart was shining like a chandelier.
Your heart was shining like a chandelier!

(They will never let you go!)
(They will never let you go!)

(They will never let you go!)

There's no escaping, you haven't the legs to stand on.
There's no escaping, you haven't the legs to stand on!
And I'm so thankful, that I'm not in your place.
And I'm so thankful, that I'm not in your place!

So, that's what they call it these days!

(OH!)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
