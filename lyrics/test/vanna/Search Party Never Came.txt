We're as far as far can be.
Let's take off our coats and stay a while, with nothing but the fire burning on.

We're as far as far can be.
Let's take off our coats and stay a while, with nothing but the fire burning on.

If we could stop ourselves right here, then what would we do differently?
In trying to make you see my point, I'll bury it deep into your chest.

Can we let go of past mistakes?
Mistakes we made, or are they stronger?
(Stronger then the two of us)

If we could stop ourselves right here, then what would we do differently?
In trying to make you see my point, I'll bury it deep into you.

And in that moment time stood still.
From that point on, there was no turning back.

And in that moment time stood still.
From that point on, there was no turning back.

There's a shadow on the wall, moving slowly towards the door.
Now the room is empty, and so are our lives.

There's a shadow on the wall, moving slowly towards the door.
Now the room is empty, and so are our lives.

In the end, they'll never know.

In the end, they'll never know.

In the end, they'll never know.

In the end, they'll never know.

She waited, and waited, and waited...
But they never came.
