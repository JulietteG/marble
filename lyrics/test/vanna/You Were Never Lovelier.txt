(Whoa!)
My amber furnace breathes.
I've got an ear to the wall.
If we sat forever in this house, the wind would take us.
(So take me)

Ride all night, like a bullet from a gun.

Ride all night, like a bullet from a gun.
(Get to me)

Ride all night, like a bullet from a gun.
(Get to me)

Ride all night, like a bullet from a gun.
(Get to me)

Ride all night, like a bullet from a gun.
(Get to me)

Get to me!

Your eyes don't lie...

(Whoa!)
Take me, take me!

Ohh, goddamn perfect eyes

Build the embers, fan the fire.
We'll fill it floor to ceiling.

Build the embers, fan the fire.
We'll fill it floor to ceiling.

Build the embers, fan the fire.
We'll fill it floor to ceiling.

(We'll fill it floor to ceiling)

Escape with a price on my head.
I'm a wanted man.
(A wanted man)

I'll meet you in the front seat, headlights off.
(Headlights off)

I'm a fugitive, a victim, and a criminal.
(A criminal)

(A criminal)
We'll make our getaway.

Invented colors, to hide us in the dark.

(Hide us in the dark)---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
