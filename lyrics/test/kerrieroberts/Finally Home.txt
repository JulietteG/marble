Here I am, where I stood
I never will ever be again 
I gave to much to what I shouldn't have
It took from me what little I had eft
It hurt me so fast
Is there a place where I can rest
Where I can finally stay and be safe

( Chorus )
Where I know that I belong
In hands that heal me
And I know I'm finally home
In arms that won't let go
Its the love only
Its the love that only you can bring
And I'll never be alone 
Cause this love doesn't run
No this love doesn't run

What I lost and what is gone
Where I've been
It doesn't matter now
Cause I let go of holding on 
To anything that's not Your love

Cause Your the only one I live with for
And I know that I'll never have to be 
afraid
of losing what I gave
Cause You keep me safe

Where I know I belong 
In the hands that heal me
And I know I'm finally home
In arms that won't let go
Its the love that only 
Its the love that only you can bring 
And I'll never be alone
Cause this love doesn't run
No this love doesn't run

I never knew the meaning of forever
I never heard the voice inside the storm
You hold my heart 
You hold the world together
Only You can hold me now
