Hands wrapped tight
Around the memories
Plays back just like a movie
A waking nightmare haunts you day and night.

You've got scars
That won't fade away
You feel them every day
So stuck you made a home
Inside your pain.

Have to make a start
Have to take that step
Leave it behind
Before it takes your breath.

(Chorus)
You don't have to stay in the same old place
Throwing it all away
Don't hold to the pain
To the hurt to the shame
That keeps coming back like a boomerang
There's grace that's stronger
Holds on longer
Deeper than your wounds.

So open up your eyes
The sun is gonna rise
You're coming back to life.

Just come back (just come back)
Just come back (just come back)
Come back to life

Just come back

Yeah it's hard
The last round in a fight
Swing back
Break into the light
Don't stop believing 
Leave the darkness behind.

Have to make a start
Have to take that step
Leave it behind
Before it takes your breath.

(Chorus)

You don't have to face this alone
And don't forget who's child you are
Just remember the one
Who defeated death to heal your heart
He makes things new 
old things are gone
Now watch Him turn it all around.

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
