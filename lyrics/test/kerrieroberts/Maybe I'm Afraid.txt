There's no way I can hide
It's written on my face
All these complications

Maybe I'm afraid
To open up and let You in
Behind the curtain

Maybe I'm afraid
Of the questions
That I know You'd raise
What I thought was certain

Maybe I'm afraid
Of the mess that is sure to make
All I tried to simplify and organize
But I just can't deny

That there's no way I can hide
It's written on my face
And all these complications
Fumbling with my equations
Now they crumble to the ground
With everything I thought
To be without Your help
Cause if I let You in
I'll never be the same
So I try to escape
Maybe I'm afraid

Maybe I'm afraid
To let go and just accept
That love has spoken 

Maybe I'm afraid
Of the way that I know You'll fix
Everything that's broken

Maybe I'm afraid
Cause I don't know who You are
That the more I get from You
The more I lose
So what am I holding onto

There's no way I can hide
It's written on my face
And all these complications
Fumbling with my equations
Now they crumble to the ground
With everything I thought
To be without Your help
Cause if I let You in
I'll never be the same
So I try to escape
Maybe I'm afraid

Afraid to be complete
I'm just so weak in Your hands
Maybe I'm afraid
Afraid it won't last
I'll only be half without You

Maybe I'm afraid
To let You change my heart
With all that's hiding

Maybe I'm afraid
That I just might fall apart
Unless Your beside me

And I know
That there's no way I can hide
It's written on my face
And all these complications
Fumbling with my equations
Now they crumble to the ground
With everything I thought
To be without Your help
Cause if I let You in
I'll never be the same
No I can't escape
Maybe I'm afraid

Maybe I'm afraid
Maybe I'm afraid
Maybe I'm afraid
Maybe I'm afraid
Maybe I'm afraid
Maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe I'm afraid---
