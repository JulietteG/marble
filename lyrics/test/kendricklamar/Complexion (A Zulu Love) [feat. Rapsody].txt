Complexion (two-step) 
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love) 
Complexion (two-step) 
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love) 

Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun 
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done 
Sneak (dissin) 
Sneak me through the back window, Im a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention 

Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun 
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run 
Sneak (dissin') 
Sneak me through the back window, Im a good field nigga 
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you 
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down 
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention 
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival 
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival 
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken 
By different shades of faces 
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, woman love the creation" 
It all came from God then you was my confirmation 
I came to where you reside 
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes 
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with... 

You like it, I love it 
You like it, I love it 

Let me talk my Stu Scott, scuse me on my 2pac 
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die 
Color of your skin, color of your eyes 
Thats the real blues, baby, like you met Jays baby 
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey 
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave 
12 years of age, thinkin my shade too dark 
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid 
And forcin my dark side like a young George Lucas 
Light dont mean you smart, bein dark dont make you stupid 
And frame of mind for them bustas, aint talkin Woohah! 
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored 
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times 
If you dont see you beautiful in your complexion 
It aint complex to put it in context 
Find the air beneath the kite, thats the context 
Yeah, baby, Im conscious, aint no contest 
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed 
Aint no stress, jigga boos wanna be 
I aint talkin Jay, I aint talkin Bey 
Im talkin days we got school watchin movie screens 
And spike yourself esteem 
The new James Bond gon be black as me 
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea 
And its all beautiful to me 
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens 
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors aint a thing 

Barefoot babies with no cares 
Teenage gun toters that dont play fair, should I get out the car? 
I dont see Compton, I see something much worse 
The land of the landmines, the hell thats on earth---
