I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today Im yelling
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe

Look inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt and never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Hook]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me thats amazing
To you thats a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today Im yelling
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe

[Verse 2]
Im trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And Im looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, Ill let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lock

[Hook]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me thats amazing
To you thats a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who is probably going to sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today Im yelling
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe

[Bridge]
You aint heard a chorus like this in a long time
Dont you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3s in the air I can see you are  in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
Ill take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream its alive
My new years resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say  Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe
Bitch dont kill my vibe---Lyrics submitted by jackie mendoza.
