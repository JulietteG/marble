Take me I'm alive, never was a girl with a wicked mind but
 everything looks better when the sun goes down i had everything
 oppertunities for eternity and i could belong to the night, 

your eyes, your eyes, i can see in your eyes, your eyes, you  
make me want to die i'll never be good enough you make me wanna 
die and everything you love  will burn up in the light and everytime 
i look inside your eyes you make me wanna die.


 taste me drink my soul show me all the things that i
 shouldn't know and there's a new moon on the rise
 i had everything oppertunities for eternity and i could belong to the night

 your eyes, your eyes, i can see in your eyes, your eyes everything
 in your eyes, your eyes you make me wanna die i'll never be good
 enough you make me wanna die and everything you love will burn
 up in the light and everytime i look inside your eyes (im  buring in the light) make me wanna die 


I'll die for you my love my love,
i'll lie for you my love my love (make me wanna die),
i'll steal for you my love my love ( make me wanna die),
i'll die for you my love my love, 


will burn up in the light and everytime 
i look inside your eyes (im burning in the light) 
look inside your eyes ( burning in the) look inside your eyes...

  Make me wanna die---Lyrics submitted by Keren.
