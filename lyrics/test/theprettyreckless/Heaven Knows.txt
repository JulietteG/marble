Jimmy's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close
You can hear him cry
Oh oh, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Sing it
Oh oh, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below

Judy's in the front seat picking up trash
Living on the dough
Gotta make that cash
Won't be pretty
Won't be sweet
She's just in here on her feet

Sing it
Oh oh, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Go
Oh oh, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Sing
Tell her so
We belong way down below
Oh oh, tell her so
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below

I've got what it takes, man
I see every day
I've got a better wise man
I know that I worth

One, two, three and four
The devil's knocking at your door
Caught in the eye of a dead man's wife
Show you life with your head up high
Now you're on your knees
With your head down low
Big mental, she wear it to go
Tell her it's good
Tell her okay
Don't do a God thing they say

Oh oh, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh oh, tell her so
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below

I've got a better wise man
I know that I worth
I've got what it takes, man
I see every day

Jenna's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close
You can hear the crying
Oh oh, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh oh, tell her so
We belong way down below
Oh oh, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh oh, tell her so
We belong way down below

Way down below, way down below
Way down below, way down below---
