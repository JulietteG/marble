You deni me baby the satisfaction of your love.
So iv been walking home alone, cause you left me out in the cold.
"he left u out now il take you home."

I'll be here after midnight wearing my believe good frown
But you know it wont be long, befor I have put your picture down.
"put your saken down for you gave the world."

I can hear you baby when you tell me you dont wnt me now.
So i'll be hanging by the phone, though I know you'l never make the call.
"don't make that call. He'll put you down."

You call me in the day light speaking of the future plan,
But when you make demands i know that i could never be your man.
"they love demands their just a game."

One day baby you realize it that i dont
One day baby you realize it that i dont
One day baby you realize it that i dont want dont want dont want.

Before I knew you baby, I could've guessed you'd be this way,
But it wouldn't stopped my love now i'm in a familiar place.
"he looks the same but something changed."

Neither without recourse wish I could undo the time.
I was walking home alone, so subjected by my own designs.

It' not over baby. For me boy this is just the start.
I still got all my love to give, enough left to fill your empty heart.
"your emptyness will full your heart."

Caring without pretense, pinic on the hill side,
Clothes of many colors lying on the bed side,
Tokens of a life time, memories I wanted wanted wanted wanted....

Here if you try, I'll tell you what you want to
Hear if you try, I'll tell you what you want to
Here if you try, I'll tell you what you want to want to want to want to.

Here if you try, I'll tell you what you want to
Hear if you try, I'll tell you what you want to
Here if you try, I'll tell you what you want to want to want to want to.

One day baby you realize it that i dont
One day baby you realize it that i dont
One day baby you realize it that i dont want dont want dont want.---Lyrics submitted by spencer.
