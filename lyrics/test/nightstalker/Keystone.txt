I know, its only rock n roll
Everything I need
And when they treat me like a dog
I give love for free
I sold my soul for the dollar
And my head got fire
Im gonna get where I can get
And then I get some higher

I got this crazy little thought
For everything Ive done
Ive got to be one step ahead of me
Im always on the run
I know this sweet illusion
When I check in your mind
I see the look in your eyes baby
When Im grooving around

Coming out of the black hole
Im not the same man anymore
Show me how to love
Im not the same man---Lyrics submitted by zis l.
