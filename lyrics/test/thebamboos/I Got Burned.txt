You're trying to strike the match
I'm trying to drown now
Oh yes, I'm gonna catch you
So pour it over
You give them what you got
Wow, I'm still dead, baby
And now I'm running hot, yeah!

Cause I feel like I'm walking on fire
when we're talking it's smoke coming out of my head
And I'm braking down like a strong man burning over you!

I got burned
Yeah, I got burned
I got burned
Yeah, I got burned
I got burned
Yeah, I got burned
It's in your eyes now
You gonna light the fuse

You're always thinking
You just can't lose, no!
I check your boys on
I even take the blame
Well our love, sugar
Is going up in flames now
Yeah!

Cause I feel like I'm walking on fire
when we talk it's smoke coming out of my head
And I'm braking down like a strong man burning over you!

I got burned
Yeah, I got burned
I got burned
Yeah, I got burned
I got burned
Yeah, I got burned

Cause I feel like I'm walking on fire
when we're talking it's smoke coming out of my head
And I'm braking down like a strong man burning over you!

I got burned
Yeah, I got burned
I got burned
Yeah, I got burned
I got burned
Yeah, I got burned
