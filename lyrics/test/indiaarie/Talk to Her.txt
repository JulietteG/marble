When you talk to her talk to her
Like you'd want somebody a
Talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her
Have a heart to heart
With her just like you
Would with your daughter
Cause everything you do or say
You got to live with every day
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

Now when you go to her
Speak truthfully
Honest as you can be, from your heart
You're in a situation
But you're losing patience
Take your time and look her in the eyes
When you just can't find the words you want
And it's hard to reach a point
Where you both can understand
Don't just tell the truth
But tell the whole truth
It'll make a better man out of you

When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody a
Talk to your mama (Don't get smart)
Don't get smart
With her, Have a heart to heart
With her, just like you would
Would with you daughter
Cause everything you do or say
You got to live with everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

It doesn't matter if
She's wearing mini a skirt or business suit
Whether she's twenty-five or ninety-nine
Treat her the way your mama taught you too
She could be the queen of Sheba, she could be a school teacher
A homemaker or lawyer
I think it's good for your karma
If when you talk to her

When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody a
Talk to your mama
Don't get smart with her
Have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would
Would with you daughter
Cause everything you do or say
You got to live with everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

Now let's keep it real
Nothing in the world will ever exist without the opposite
There has to be a sun and a moon
A man and a woman
And that's just the way it is
Humanity excited
And everybody's fighting
How do we restore the peace
Mama Earth is hurting
And everybody's searching for that feminine energy
You gotta talk to her

When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody a
Talk to your mama (Watch your mouth, yeah yeah)
Don't get smart with her have a heart to heart with her
Just like you would
Would with you daughter
Cause everything you do or say
You got to live with everyday
She's somebody's baby
She's somebody's sister
She's somebody's mama

When you talk to her talk to her
Like you want somebody a
Talk to your mama
Just like you'd fight for your sister
If you knew that someone dissed her
How you gonna care for your daughter
Turn around and talk bad about her mama
Same way you listen to your auntie
Never interrupt while she speaks
Make your words sweet like candy
As if you were talking to your granny yeah
If you really love her then (say so)
And If you really need her then (say so)
You Love the way she thinks (say so)
You love the way she speaks (say so)
When you need some good conversation (say so)
Say so (say so)
If you want her in your life (say so)
You want her to be your wife (say so)
Tell her she's your best friend (say so) (alright)
You'll be there to the end (alright)(say so)
If you're thinking about leaving (say so)
If you wonder where she going (say so)
If you need to breed with her (say so)
You just want to be with her (say so)
If you love her hair (say so)
If you want her there (say so)
Tell me if you really want her (say so)
You wanna slap her down (say so)
Say so...
Laughing...
If you like her loving
You wanna feel her hugging
To fade...---Lyrics submitted by Ahrmanee.
