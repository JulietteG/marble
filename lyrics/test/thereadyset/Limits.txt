She's got my heart strapped down
To the beat just like that 808
Did you know I'm thinking of you everyday

Is it wrong
Is it wrong
Is it wrong

Is it too loud now
It's the shaking of your bones, yeah
From your head down to your toes

Run along
Run along
Run along

She's gonna move like the smoke in your lungs
And I'm dreaming I can feel it with the tip of my tongue
And tell me how you're feeling
We can touch the ceiling
Jump start my heart

Oh girl
I wanna know your love
I wanna feel your warmth on my skin
(so recklessly)
I'll show up and be your summer love
Cause you're the breakout feeling of my week
(so endlessly)
Say there's still time

And did you feel the beat stop
Drop your heart
Pick it up, yeah

I wanna see your night eyes
And if it feels right
Well then maybe we can be alone
Take everything around you
Let me surround you

Is it wrong 
Is it wrong
Is it wrong

Is it too late now
For me to compliment your style
You've got that subtle grace for miles

Run along
Run along
Run along

She's gonna move like the smoke in your lungs
And I'm dreaming I can feel it with the tip of my tongue
And tell me how you're feeling
We can touch the ceiling
Jump start my heart

Oh girl
I wanna know your love
I wanna feel your warmth on my skin
(so recklessly)
I'll show up and be your summer love
Cause you're the breakout feeling of my week
(so endlessly)
Say there's still time

Feel your heart drop
Pick it up yeah
And I can tell we're gonna be alone

So let that heat last 
Bring it back
Girl jump in my arms
Cause oh the weather's getting kinda cold

She's gonna move like the smoke in your lungs
And I'm dreaming I can feel it with the tip of my tongue
And tell me how you're feeling
We can touch the ceiling
Oh

Oh girl
I wanna know your love
I wanna feel your warmth on my skin
(so recklessly)
I'll show up and be your summer love
Cause you're the breakout feeling of my week
(so endlessly)
Say there's still time

Night sky
Light up your diamond eyes
And baby you won't feel alone
You won't feel alone
I'll show up and be your summer love
And feel the heat seep through my bones
Say there's still time---Lyrics submitted by Alexis.
