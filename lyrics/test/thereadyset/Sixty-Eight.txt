And one day the worlds gonna be all right,
And there will be no pain,
Shut the ICU down tonight,
'Cause everyone is safe,
And I will overlook this operation by your side,

'Cause we`re too young, we`re still kids ,
Were too young, were still kids,

I see your hearts get bigger when you lose your friends,
And everyones around you saying that its not the end,
It's not the end,

But you cried so hard,
And I watched you grow so strong,
And I made you laugh in my arms,
And your tear-stained shirt, you felt the snowflakes on your back,

And you stood so proud,
You had me wishing, wanting, begging for some words from you,
And you smiled to the crowd,
Its enough for now,

Cause were too young, we`re still kids,
We`re too young, were still kids,

Take a break from the mask,
You`ve done enough today,
I saw you smiling like its all ok,
And it will be soon,

This is a song for the boys and the girls I never met,
And all my friends that I have had and I have kept,
So get me down, down for the count,
Cause we are all the same, were all the same,

Its my job to keep you strong, I do it cause Im supposed to,
Its my job to keep you strong, I do it cause I like to,
Its my job to keep you strong, I do it cause Im told to,
Its my job to keep you strong, I do it cause I love you,
I do it 'cause I love you,
I do it 'cause I love you,
I do it 'cause I love you,

On that day, we will be in charge,
The weathers always bright and 68 degrees!---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
