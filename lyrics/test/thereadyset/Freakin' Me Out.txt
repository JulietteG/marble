Hey I'd like to stay a little longer,
Though I wouldn't want to come off like a hope-monger and,
Hey ain't it strange when you get the joke the next day?

Well we danced alone
While everyone cashed out,
Told me that you insist
And we got the last song stuck in our heads
It goes a little like this

Blame it on the wine, the night
We were talkin' till dawn
Like that you had me down for the count
Never thought you'd make a move
Out of the blue
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Oh I love
(I love)
The way
(the way)
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Hey I bet they never saw it comin'
Thinkin' what could be the harm in passin' out with shoes on
Strange, all those films from the 80s end this way

Where we danced alone while
Everyone cashed out
Come on now I insist
And we'll get the last song stuck in our heads
It goes a little like this

Blame it on the wine, the night
We were talkin' till dawn
Like that you had me down for the count
Never thought you'd make a move
Out of the blue
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Oh I love
(I love)
The way
(the way)
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Oh I love
(I love)
The way
(the way you freak me out)
I love the way you're freakin' me out

So don't stop, don't stop
Ooh you caught me off guard
Don't stop
I love the way, the way you don't stop
Don't stop
Ooh you caught me off guard
Don't stop
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Dancin' alone while
Everyone's cashed out
Come on now I insist
And we'll get the last song stuck in our heads
It goes a little like this

Blame it on the wine, the night
We were talkin' till dawn
Like that you had me down for the count
Never thought you'd make a move
Out of the blue
I love the way you're freakin' me out

Oh I love
(I love)
The way
(the way you freak me out)
I love the way you're freakin' me out
(freakin' me out)

Oh I love
(I love)
The way
(the way you freak me out)
I love the way you're freakin' me out

I love the way you're freakin' me out
I love the way you're freakin' me out ---
