I could've wrote down
Every thought i've been thinking to myself all this past year
I would've said in doubt
OH! I wanna make myself clear
And baby clearly
I need some blance in my ears right now
Cause i've been freaking myself out
And i've been waking this whole town


And then I turned myself inside out
La da da da da  
And it's all about
The way your hips move side to side
Left to right
Guide me home tonight

And I, need a little more thunder a little more lightning
A little more you
Be my lantern, help me shine on through

So sad I gotta comb my brain for the words to say
If you don't feel right
Then it's a wastes night the price to pay

So,so high and the irony could be cut with a knife
Cause it's my first chance
But it's my last chance
All right


And then I turned myself inside out
La da da da da  
And it's all about
The way your hips move side to side
Left to right
Guide me home tonight

And I, need a little more thunder a little more lightning
A little more you
Be my lantern, help me shine on through

Baby,well I gotta have you lovin' me through the night
And when my world has become a wolr wind
Will you be my white flag?

Speed up like sugar
I'm a wrecking you know that I
Can't do anything about it,about it
Break it down i'm on my knees
Baby take another chance oh please
Imma fall (idk)
You're taking me out 
I'm taking you in


I gotta migrate a catastrophie
Stood strong and it was the best for 
Me my town is irrela-relavent
The blue eyes match realize Yeah!!!...

And I, need a little more thunder a little more lightning
A little more you
Be my lantern, help me shine on through

And I, need a little more thunder a little more lightning
A little more you
Be my lantern, help me shine on through

Baby,well I gotta have you lovin' me tonight
And when my world has become a wolr wind
Will you be my white flag?---Lyrics submitted by Deijah.
