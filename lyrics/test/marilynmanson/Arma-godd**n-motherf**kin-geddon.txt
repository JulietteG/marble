Death to ladies first, then the gentlemen
All sorts of taxing face-lifts, abortion, nervous break-dance
Satanic girls gone wild, it's truly fuckin' suicidal

First you try to fuck it, then you try to eat it
If it hasn't learned your name, you better kill it before they see it
First you try to fuck it, then you try to eat it
If it hasn't learned your name, you better kill it before they see it

It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
(Fuck, eat, kill, now do it again)
It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
(Fuck, eat, kill, et cetera)
First you try to fuck it, then you try to eat it
If it hasn't learned your name, you better kill it before they see it
It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon

I've got a blackened soul, morals in a hole, wish I was so dead
Now the TV set's a sharp and cold depression
Pointless intervention, illegal separation, call my dealer
I want my lawyer, we've got a situation

First you try to fuck it, then you try to eat it
If it hasn't learned your name, you better kill it before they see it
First you try to fuck it, then you try to eat it
If it hasn't learned your name, you better kill it before they see it

It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
(Fuck, eat, kill, now do it again)
It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
(Fuck, eat, kill, et cetera)
On the news, or is it the noose?
The same results may vary
Side effects all vary
It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon

Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon

It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
(Fuck, eat, kill, now do it again)
It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
(Fuck, eat, kill, et cetera)
Fuck the goddamned TV and the radio
And fuck making hits, I'm taking credit for the death toll
It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon

It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon
It's Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin'-geddon---Lyrics submitted by Shiloh.
