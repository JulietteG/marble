We missed the film close
To the third act and the misery
It's not rain you rapist werewolves
It's God pissing down on you
I won't die alone cause I'll break off my own arms
Sharpen my bones, stab you once for each time I thought you
Were trying to take something you'll never be good enough
To even look upon

It's better to push something when it's slipping
Than to risk being dragged down
If you want to hit bottom
Don't bother try to taking me with you
And I won't answer if you call
Too happy to let in Hell
Trying to break your fall,
Your fall

This isn't mine
Won't need to change the names
Everyone around you has murdered someone,
Something sacred
And isn't one nail without dirt under it
Isn't any white cotton panties
That aren't soaked and stained red

It's better to push something when it's slipping
Than to risk being dragged down
If you want to hit bottom
Don't bother try to taking me with you
And I won't answer if you call
Too happy to let in Hell
Trying to break your fall,
Your fall

Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Fire, oh...
Into the fire
Fire, oh...
Into the fire
Fire, oh...
Into the fire
Fire, oh...---Lyrics submitted by destiny.
