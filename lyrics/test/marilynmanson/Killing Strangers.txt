This world doesn't need no opera
We're here for the operation
We don't need a bigger knife 
(Cause we got guns)
We got guns, we got guns
We got guns, you better run 
(you better run, you better run, you better run)

We're killing strangers
We're killing strangers
We're killing strangers, so we don't kill the ones that we
Love

We pack demolition
We can't pack emotion
Dynamite, we just might
So blow us a kiss, blow us a kiss
Blow us a kiss, and we'll blow you to pieces

And we got guns, we got guns
Motherf-ckers better, better, better run
We got, we got guns
Motherf-ckers better run

You better run
We got guns, we got guns, we got guns, we got guns---
