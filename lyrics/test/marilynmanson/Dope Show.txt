the drugs they say 
make us feel so hollow 
we love in vain 
narcissistic and so shallow
the cops and queers
to swim you have to swallow
hate today
theres no love for tomorrow
we're all stars now in the dope show
we're all stars now in the dope show

the'res alot of pretty, pretty ones
who want to get you high
but all the pretty, pretty ones
will leave you low and blow your mind
we're all stars now in the dope show
we're all stars now in the dope show
they love you when you're on all the covers
when you're not then they love another
they love you when you're on all the covers
when you're not then they love another

the drugs they say are made in california
we love your face we'd really like to sell you

the cops and queers make good looking models
I hate today who will i wake up with tomorrow?

there's alot of pretty, pretty ones who wanna get you high
but all the pretty, pretty ones will leave you low and blow your mind

they love you when you're on all the covers 
when you're not then they love another

they love you when you're on all the covers 
when you're not then they love another

there's alot of pretty, pretty ones who wanna get you high
but all the pretty, pretty ones will leave you low and blow your mind...blow your mind

we're all stars now in the dope show
we're all stars now in the dope show---Lyrics submitted by matt.
