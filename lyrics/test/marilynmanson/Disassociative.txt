I can tell you what they say in space,
that our Earth is too gray
But when the spirit is so digital,
the body acts this way
The world was killing me
The world was killing me
Disassociative

The nervous systems down
the nervous systems down i know (2x)

I can never get out of here
i dont want to just float in fear
a dead astronaut in space (2x)

sometimes we walk like we were shot
through  our heads my love
we write our song in space like we're 
already dead and gone

your world was killing me
world was killing me
disassociative (2x)


I can never get out of here
i dont want to just float in fear
a dead astronaut in space (2x)

the nervous systems down
the nervous systems down 
the nervous systems down 
the nervous systems down

I can never get out of here
i dont want to just float in fear
a dead astronaut in space (2x)---Lyrics submitted by Daryl.
