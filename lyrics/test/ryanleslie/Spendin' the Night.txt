Baby, I don't wanna leave you

V1
If I chilled for the night, would you like that
I wanna know would you like that
If I made you feel alright, would you like that
I wanna know would you like that
If I turned the lights low, would you like that
I wanna know would you like that
If I take it nice and slow, would you like that
I wanna know would you like that 

Bridge:
You got a body like a beauty queen
And a face that belongs on broadway
Straight up out a magazine
So tonight you deserve to have it your way
Got a body like a beauty queen
And a face that belongs on broadway
Straight up out a magazine
So tonight you deserve to have it your way

Chorus:
I don't wanna leave you (baby I don't)
I'm spendin the night (with you tonight)
I don't wanna leave you (I'm gonna stay here)
I'm spendin the night, if it's alright
I don't wanna leave you (no I don't)
I'm spendin the night (with you tonight)
I don't wanna leave you (I wanna stay)
I'm spendin the night, if it's alright

V2
Now if I rock you to the beat, would you like that
I wanna know would you like that
If I sing you to sleep, would you like that
I wanna know would you like that
If I say I'd ease your mind, would you like that
I wanna know would you like that
If I really took my time, would you like that
I wanna know would you like that

Chorus: Repeat 3x---Lyrics submitted by Janelle.
