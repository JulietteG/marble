Your kindness, leads me to repentance.
Your goodness, draws me to your side.
Your mercy, calls me to be like You.
Your favor, is my delight

Everyday, I'll awaken my praise
And pour out a song, from my heart.

You are good 
You are good
You are good
And Your mercy is forever (x2)

Your kindness, leads me to repentance.
Your goodness, draws me to Your side.
Your mercy, calls me to be like You.
And Your favor, is my delight.

Everyday, I'll awaken my praise
And pour out a song, from my heart.

You are good
You are good
You are good
And Your mercy is forever (x4)

You alone are good 

Your kindness is forever.
Your goodness is forever.
You mercy is forever.
Forever (x6)---Lyrics submitted by Meigan.
