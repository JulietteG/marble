Nations rise and nations fall 
but God is the Lord above them all 
Reign Jesus reign 

Kingdoms of this world become  
the kingdom of the risen Son 
Reign Jesus reign 

We're declaring that your Kingdom has come 
We're declaring that your Kingdom is here 
The whole earth is filled with Your glory 
The heavens declaring Your praise 
The nations are filled with Your wonder 

Holy are You Lord , Holy are You Lord 
God of glory, God of might send out Your Truth and light 
Shine Jesus shine 
As the waters fill the sea, so let Your glory be 

Holy ,Holy is the Lord Almighty 
Holy, Holy all the nations rise singing 
There is no one like You, there is none beside You 
All of creation falling down when they see Your face 
Holy are You Lord, Holy are You Lord---
