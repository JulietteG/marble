I didn't want a river
But you handed me the sea
I didn't want a forest
But you chopped down every tree
I didn't want these blue skies
But you shot down every bird
I didn't want these questions
That you're screaming to be heard

And the distance between stars
Is the distance between our hearts
And the difference between runners in a race

Is a moment of grace

I didn't want a feature length film
I said a preview will do
But somehow you convinced me
To sit here in the dark with you
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/sara_hickman/moment_of_grace.html ]
And you carry this hole in your heart
You expect me to fill it on the double
But I can't carry more than myself
Oh my own shit and shovel

And the distance between stars
Is the distance between our hearts
And the difference between runners in a race

Is a moment of grace

Da dum dum dum daday
Da dum da dada day
Da dum dum dum daday
Da dum dada day

I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't want you
I just needed you the night
You say a man's got to do what a man's got to do
I say
A woman's
Got
The same right

And the distance between stars
Is the distance between our hearts
Oh ohhh oh
And the difference between runners in a race

Is a moment of grace

Is a moment---Lyrics submitted by Rebecca Bruner.
