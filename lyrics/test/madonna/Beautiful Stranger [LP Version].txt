Haven't we met?
You're some kind of beautiful stranger
You could be good for me
I have a taste for danger

If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Heaven forbid, 
I take my chance on a beautiful stranger

I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're devil in disguise 
That's why I'm singing this song

To know you 
Is to love you
You're everywhere I go 
And everybody knows

To love you
Is to be part of you
I paid for you in tears
And swallowed all my pride

Da da da da da da da da da da da
Beautiful stranger
Da da da da da da da da da da da
Beautiful stranger

If I'm smart than I'll run away 
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Haven't you heard?
I fell in love with a beautiful stranger

I looked into your face
my heart was dancing all over the place
I'd like to change my point of view 
If i could just forget about you

To know you
Is to love you
You're everywhere i go
And everybody knows

I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise 
That's why I'm singing this song to you

To know you 
Is to love you
You're everywhere I go 
And everybody knows
I paid for you in tears 
and swallowed all my pride

Da da da da da da da da da da da
Beautiful stranger
