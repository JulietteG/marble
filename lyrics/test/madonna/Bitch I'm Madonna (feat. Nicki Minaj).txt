You cant touch this
Cause Im a bad bitch

We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumpin, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah well be drinking and nobodys gonna stop us
And well be kissing anybody thats around us
I just wanna have fun tonight
(Love this sht tonight)
Love me under the flashing light

Make me blow up this house tonight

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch Im Madonna

Were jumping in the pool
And swimming with our clothes on
 brought a pee-wee to my show and got my freak on
The neighbors pissed and says hes gonna call the Five-O
If thats your weapon we gon give a good show

I just wanna have fun tonight
Love me under the flashing light

Make me blow up this house tonight

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch Im Madonna

You gonna treat this love this time
Ooh, oh, oh ooh
