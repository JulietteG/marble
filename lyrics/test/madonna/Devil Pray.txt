Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
Ive been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away

Ive been swimming in the ocean
Till I almost drown
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

And we can do drugs
And we can smoke weed
We can drink whiskey
Yea we can get high
We can get stoned

And we can sniff glue
And we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever lost with no way home

Yea we can run and we can hide but we wont find the answers
If you dont doubt youll get help along the way
But if you want to save your soul
We could travel off together and make the devil pray

Mother Mary, cant you help me?
Cos Ive gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away

The ground beneath my feet is getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on but Im getting weaker
Watch me disappear

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed
We can drink whiskey
Yea we can get high
We can get stoned

And we can sniff glue
And we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever lost with no way home

Yea we can run and we can hide but we wont find the answers
If you dont doubt youll get help along the way
But if you want to save your soul
We could travel off together and make the devil pray

Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Sing Hallelujah
Ooh Ooh
Sing my song
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
The Devils here to fool you
Until my storys told

I say
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Sing Hallelujah
Ooh Ooh
Sing my song
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
The Devils here to fool you
Until my storys told---
