get your motor runnin 
and head out on a highway
looking for adventure
and whatever comes our way   hey

ya driven gonna make it happen
change the world in the love embrace
fire all of your guns at once in
explode in space

i like smoke and lighting
heavy metal thunder
racing with the wind
and the feeling that im under   ow

ya driven gonna make it happen
change the worldin the love embrace
fire all of your guns at once in
explode in space

like a true nature child 
we were born (born) born to be wild
we can climb so high
never wanna die

born to be wild
(born to be wild)
born to be wild

get your motor runnin 
and head out on highway
looking for adventure
and what ever comes our way

ya drivin gonna make it happen
change the world in the love embrace
fire all of your guns at once in 
explode in space

like a true nature child 
we were born (born) born to be wild
we can climb so high 
never wanna die 

born to be wild 
(born to be wild)
born to be wild

born to be wild 
(born to be wild)
born to be wild
(born to be wild)---Lyrics submitted by Kody.
