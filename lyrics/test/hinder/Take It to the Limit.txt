She's got a body I can barely believe
She's indeed the devil but on another level
Her kind of college like her killing me
There is nothing better than riding her forever
I gotta come home when I'm ready to roll
she's got her knees up and down

Speed on up, take it to the limit
only live once where they fast for the minute
Sweet her up, take it to the limit
go and get some, gotta fight till the finish
and take it to the limit yeah yeah

Zero to sixty in four point three
She gets me into trouble and then she makes it double
Takes all my money she's a spending machine
but baby I ain't heaven I love the way you work it
I gotta come home when I'm ready to roll
she's got her knees up and down

Speed on up, take it to the limit
only live once where they fast for the minute
Sweet her up, take it to the limit
go and get some, gotta fight till the finish
and take it to the limit yeah yeah

Her kind of curves are killing me

Speed on up, take it to the limit
only live once where they fast for the minute
Sweet her up, take it to the limit
go and get some, gotta fight till the finish
and take it to the limit yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
