come on yeah
we'll its been seven years since that summer
why'd you call me at all cuz im with her now
you know you will have to get over
well i finally forgot all those times some how

don't bring it all back to me
i know this is hard to see
you know
the summer we smoked in the sun
you know
its only because we were young
and we promised to always remember
that we'e wind up together forever
looking back we should have some fun
a summer lost in the sun

no i dont think its right that i see you
_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_?_
get over me baby you need too

dont bring it all back to me
i know this is hard to see
you know
the summer we smoked in the sun
you know
its only because we were young
and we promised to always remember
that we'e wind up together forever

you know
after all that we said it was done
you know
we were leaving because we were young
and we promised to always remember
that we'd wind up together forever
looking back we should have some fun
a summer lost in the sun

im going under getting over you
i fooled myself by thinking we were through

you know
the summer we smoked in the sun
you know
its only because we were young
and we promised to always remember
that we'd wind up together forever

you know
after all that we said it was done
you know
we were leaving because we were young
and we promised to always remember
that we'e wind up together forever

well its been seven years since that summer
why'd you call me at all cuz im with her now
you know you were hard to get over
i finally forgot all those times somehow
but looking back we should have some fun
a summer lost in the sun
