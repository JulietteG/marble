There ain't no reason you and me should be alone tonight
Yeah baby, 
I got a reason that you
Who should take me home tonight

I need someone who thinks it's right when it's all wrong tonight
Yeah baby,
Right on the limb is where we know
We both belong tonight

It's hard to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you

I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

Another shot before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah baby,
I'm on the edge of something final
We call life tonight

Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah baby,
It doesn't help cause everybody knows my name
Tonight

It's hard to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you

I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you---Lyrics submitted by Jason C.
