I'm driving in my car, I turn on the radio
I'm pullin you close, you just say no
You say you don't like it, but I know you're a liar
`cause when we kiss,  oh fire

Late at night you're takin me home
You say you wanna stay, I say I wanna be alone
You say you don't love me, but i know you're a liar
`cause when we kiss,  oh fire, fire

You had a hold on me, right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin' actin like a fool
Well your kisses they burn but your heart stays cool

Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah
Baby you can bet their love they couldn't deny
Your words say split but I know you're a liar,
`cause when we kiss, oh fire

I say I don't love you, But you know I'm a liar
`cause when we kiss, oh fire
mm kisses like fire
burn me up with fire
like what you do to me, fire
burnin' me burnin' me, fire
like what you do to me, fire
oh fire---Lyrics submitted by Jillian Youd.
