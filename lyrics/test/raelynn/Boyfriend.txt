 Lets be honest
We dont got a lot in common when it comes down to it
You can take his breath away
And light up every room when you walk through it
But I dont want your six-foot legs and angel face and sophistication
Dont really want to cause a scene but girl youve got everything

And I want your boyfriend
Im not gonna lie
Ill be his girl when he tells you goodbye
Dont worry I wont take him cause I aint that low
I want your boyfriend
Just thought you should know

That he and I go back so far
Oh my gosh we lived in his first truck
First time we heard Shania Twain
Think we were on our way to Lubbock
And I know you think he loves you now
Seen so many girls come in and out
It sounds a bit insensitive but the truth is what it is

I want your boyfriend
Im not gonna lie
Ill be his girl when he tells you goodbye
Dont worry I wont take him cause I aint that low
I want your boyfriend
Just thought you should know yeah

Dont know why you act so surprised
Cant you see it in his eyes?
You mustve known it all this time
Yeah I want you boyfriend to tell you the truth
Ill be right there when he gets over you
Whats meant to be will always find its way in the end

I want your boyfriend
Im not gonna lie
Ill be his girl when he tells you goodbye
Dont worry I wont take him cause I aint that low
I want your boyfriend [x3]
Just thought you should know---
