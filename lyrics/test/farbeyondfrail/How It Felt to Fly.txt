Everyone wants me to sing sad songs
So I do
Cuz everyone seems to have seen someone go
And I have to
They all say the pain
Is too much to pay
Too much to pay to play these silly love games
I just dont feel the same
Cuz even though Ive been brought down so many times
I remember how you and I would fly
Know how loves meant to be
Cuz Boy you showed how it felt to fly
I wont stop trying to find
Something that feels like you and I
Every time I leave my room, someone new
Catches my eye
I start to feel light and I remember how it felt
How it felt to fly
The same song gets sung again
We talk until we touch
Then we touch until it turns
To something sad
See I dont think thats so bad
Cuz even though Ive been brought down so many times
I remember how you and I would fly
I know how loves meant to be
Cuz Boy you showed me how it felt to fly
I wont stop trying to find
Something that feels like you and I
Some day Im gonna find someone
That feels like you
Some day Im gonna find someone
That feels like you
Some day Im gonna find someone
That feels like you
Some day Im gonna find someone
That feels like you
And fly
I know how loves meant to be
Cuz Boy you showed me how it felt to fly
I know its something Ill find
Cuz Baby were all meant to fly
Were all meant to fly...---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
