Stranger, youre perfect
As far as I can tell
Would you like to go somewhere
To forget how life can hurt like hell
Lets save the introduction
Cuz the sun is already in the west
Were too young to feel helpless
This might be the last chance we get
Well run, run away
Drive until day breaks
Yeah well get outta this place
Lifes a hard road no one can blame
Well pick up the pieces
Weve lost along the way
Well live along a river
With a valley to ourselves
Well build a world for dreamers
Just like Id once tried and failed
Well run, run away
Drive until day breaks
Yeah well get outta this place
Lifes a hard road no one can blame
Well pick up the pieces
Weve lost along the way
Stranger, I need you with me
And I dont even know your name
Lets not tell our stories
Theres no need, cuz life hurts the same
Well run, run away
Drive until day breaks
Yeah, well get outta this place
Lifes a hard road no one can blame
Well pick up the pieces
Weve lost along the way
Well pick up the pieces
Weve lost along the way
So many pieces that have been lost along the way...---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
