How long will love last now?
How long will love last now?
How long will love last now?
How long will love last now
Until its over again?
Until its over again
I watched you walk on by
I watched you walk on by
I watched you walk on by
And tears came to my eyes
Never thought Id feel this way
When I see you
I wanna think this is maybe worth a chance
But I really cant say
How long will love last now?
How long will love last now?
How long will love last now?
How long will love last now
Until its over again?
Until its over again
I held onto you tight
I held onto you tight
I held onto you tight
And you kissed me goodnight
And you left me here alone
And I hope that when tomorrow comes
You will come around again
But I really dont know
How long will love last now?
How long will love last now?
How long will love last now?
How long will love last now
Until its over, over again?
Until its over, over again
Until its over, over again
Until its over, over again...
Again
Again---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
