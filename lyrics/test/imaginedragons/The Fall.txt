Maybe Im broken 
Maybe Im wrong 
I couldve spoken sooner than I should have 
Only the good die old 
Thats what they told me 
But I dont know 

Maybe Im breaking up with myself 
Maybe Im thinking I should just keep to the things that Ive been told 
Wait for the colors to turn to gold 

Do you know? 
Do you know? 
Youre all I know 
Youre all I know 
When everything 
Comes crashing down 
Youre all I know 
Youre all I know 

Im ready for the fall 
Im ready for everything that I believed in to drift away 
Ready for the leaves 
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away 

Maybe Im destined to be distraught 
Always a reason 
Breaking me down to my knees in the dead of night 
I keep on praying to see the light 
Maybe Im breaking up with myself 
Maybe Im thinking I should just keep to the things that Ive been told 
Wait for the colors to turn to gold 

You were the one
You were the one
You were the one
Who helped me see 

You were the one
You were the one
Oh you gave it all to me 

Im ready for the fall 
Ready for the leaves 

Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away---
