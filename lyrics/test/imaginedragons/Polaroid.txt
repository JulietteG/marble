Im a reckless mistake
Im a cold nights intake
Im a one night too long
Im a come on too strong

Pre-Chorus
All my life Ive been living in the fast lane
Cant slow down
Im a rollin freight train
One more time
Gotta start all over
Can't slow down
Im a lone red rover

Im a hold my cards close
Im a wreck what I love most
Im a first class let down
Im a shut up sit down

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
Thats never arriving
At you are the pay raise
Always a touch out of view
And I am the color of boom

[Repeat Pre-Chorus]

Chorus
Oh
How did it come to this?
Oh
Love is a polaroid
Better in picture
But never can fill the void

I'm a midnight talker
Oh Im an alley walker
Im a day late two face
I'm a burn out quick pace

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
Thats never arriving
At you are the opera
Always on time and in tune
And I am the color of boom

[Repeat Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Bridge
(Series of ohs)
Im gonna get ready
For the rain to pour heavy
Let it fall, fall
Let it fall upon my head

[Pre-Chorus]

oh
How did it come to this?
oh
Love is a polaroid
Better in picture
But never can fill the void

Love is a polaroid (x4)---
