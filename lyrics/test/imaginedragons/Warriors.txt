As a child, you would wait
And watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be
The one that work while they all play
And you, you lay, awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town

The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the best, improve yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne
Above, don't weep for me because
This will be the labor of my love

Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town---
