Oh quiet down, I've had enough 
I guess its now or never 
Iv been around, I've settled up 
Ill bolt soon or later 

I took a photograph of me 
When I was only nineteen 
I looked a little lost at sea 
I keep trying to find me 

So pray for me brother 
I need redemption 
I'm just a man 
A man on a mission 
I want no trouble
Pray for me sister 
Give me a mention 
I got no faith 
And oh did I mention 
I want no trouble

Oh pack it up and hit the road 
And only take my lighter 
I've seen glitz, I've seen the glam 
but I prefer the pay dirt 

Maybe you could save my soul 
Cause of all the things that I dont know 
Maybe you could save my soul 
Cause of all the things that I dont know ---
