Get down with the victim
We both know you need them
Youre stuck in the middle
Of all irrelevance
And your heart is beating
Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

Pre-Chorus
When youve made it
Wont ya tell me what to do
Cause Im playin' it all wrong
When you made it, when you made it
Wont ya tell me what to do
Cause Im playin it all wrong

Chorus
You cant fight the friction
So ease it off
Cant take the pressure
So ease it off
Dont tell me to be strong
ease it off
You cant fight the friction
So ease it off

And get into the system
We both know you need one
The tip of the needle
Is taking over you
And your heart is beating

Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

[Pre-Chorus]
[Repeat Chorus]

Ohhh why cant you let go
Like a bird in the snow
This is no place to build your home

[Repeat Chorus x2]---
