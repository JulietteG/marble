About time for anyone telling you off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder stopped in cold to read
No time
Get mine and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time

The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go, you'll never be loved till youve made your own,
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours, you never know the top till you get too low

Chorus
A son of a stepfather
A son of a
I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a
I'm so sorry

No lies and no deceiving man is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that death is from above
No time
get mine and make no excuses waste of precious breath
No time
The sun shines on everyone, everyone love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go, you'll never be loved till youve made your own,
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours, you never know the top till you get too low

[Repeat Chorus]

Life isn't always what you think itd be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you somehow, somehow
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go, you'll never be loved till youve made your own,
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours, you never know the top till you get too low

[Repeat Chorus]

I'm so sorry (x3)---
