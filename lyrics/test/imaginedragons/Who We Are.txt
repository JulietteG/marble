Up in the morning
Up in the evening
Picking down talks
With the birds could imagine me

Up in the mountain
Down in the king' s lair
Pushing these boxes
In the heat of the afternoon, ohh afternoon

We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No..

Its who we are
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far
Doesnt matter if its all okay
Doesnt matter if its not our day

So wont you save us
What we are
Dont look clear
Cause its all up hill from here
Ooohh..

Up in the attic
Down in the cellar
Lost in the static
Coming back for more
Oh for more

Out with the reason
In with the season
Taking down names
In my book of jealousy
Jealousy

We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No..

Its who we are
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far
Doesnt matter if its all okay
Doesnt matter if its not our day

Because its who we are
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far
Doesnt matter if its all okay
Doesnt matter if its not our day

So wont you save us
What we are
Dont look clear
Cause its all up hill from here

Ohhhh..

They say were crazy [x8]

Its who we are
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far
Doesnt matter if its all okay
Doesnt matter if its not our day

Because its who we are
Doesnt matter if weve gone too far
Doesnt matter if its all okay
Doesnt matter if its not our day

So wont you save us
What we are
Dont look clear
Cause its all up hill from here

Ohhhh.. ---
