Schoolyard freaks are freezing, down getting teased again
I'm looking back and down and watching it go by
Down at the stockyards cattle screaming 
Tthe trains squeak by again
I can feel my breath and I'm so thankful 
I'm not one of them

The sound of the ground freezing is pounding once again
It comes with the wind that once wiped off our smiles
Alarm clock bells are screaming out the same routine again
Scrape open your eyes, rise and fucking shine, 7 am

Sit down, dead weight, and wonder
Unsure, unslept, uncovered
The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes,
Through 5-3 eyes

Schoolyard freaks are freezing, pushed to the ground again
I'm looking up and west for black to fill the sky
The sound of bottles breaking still breaking in my ears
They opened just in time to empty out 
And gouge away the years

Sit down, dead weight, and wonder
Unsure, unslept, uncovered
The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes,
Through 5-3 eyes

Schoolyard freaks are bleeding, down getting kicked again
I can taste the earth and feel it in my eyes
The sound of cattle screaming, still screaming in my ears
They came in metal coffins -
chained me up and hacked me off my years 

Sit down, dead weight, and wonder
Unsure, unslept, uncovered
The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes,
Through 5-3 eyes---Lyrics submitted by David.
