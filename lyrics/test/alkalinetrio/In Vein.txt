my point of refrence makes me
afraid to began convincing
but you might as well just change your name
because i only reconize this shadow
kind of like a superhero
with nobody's best interest in mind
now there's blood in the water
that i squeezed from this stone here
and we turned into our cheap wine
i swallowed every drop
and i could feel my stomach rotting
and you were so suportave as i drank through the pain
       (CHORUS)
do you reconize this shape? it's the back of your hand
you paste it on my face here again and again
and i dont wanna be the one who takes this place in vein
dove off the deep side platform
jackknife to bon dryest floor
one broken ankle saved my name
and this eraserburn i dig in deep,at every turn
it keeps getting darker and the fear stays the same
       (REPEAT CHORUS)
i dont wanna take this place in vein---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
