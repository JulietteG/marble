we will never know which way this road is gonna turn
can't be sure of how quick your wick is gonna burn
       (PRE CHORUS)
so sing to me your darkest secrets
time to leave behind your regrets
before we get lost in the blink of an eye
       (CHORUS)
this carrion has been forgotten
left for dead in the sun rotting
the answer lies here in this tragidy
that ends with you and me
when we're dragged from the light
into the night
we have been warned which why the sun is gonna blow
but where the ripe-tide takes us to we'll never know
now your screaming out for jesus
or for anyone please save us before we get lost
in the blink of an eye
       (REPEAT CHORUS)
       (REPEAT PRE  CHORUS)
       (REPEAT CHORUS)
the answer lies here in the mytery
that starts with you and me
when we're dragged from the light
into the night,into the night,into the night,into the night
when we're dragged from the light
into the night---Lyrics submitted by taylor.
