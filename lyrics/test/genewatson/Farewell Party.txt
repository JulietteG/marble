When the last breath of life is gone from my body
And my lips are as cold as the sea
When my friends gather  'round for my farewell party
Won't you pretend you love me?

There'll be flowers from those who'll cry when I go
And leave you in this world alone
I know you'll have fun at my farewell  party
I know you'll be glad when I'm gone. 

Don't be mad  at  me for wanting to keep you
'Til my  life on this ol' word is through
You'll be free at the end of my farewell party
But I'll go away loving you.

There'll be flowers from those who'll cry when I  go
And leave you in this ol' world alone
I know you'll have fun at my farewell party
I know you'll be glad  when I'm gone.

Oh, I know you'll be glad when I'm gone.---Lyrics submitted by Linda.
