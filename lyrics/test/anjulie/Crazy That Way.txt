Sometimes I lock myself inside your closet,
breathe in the scent of your clothes.
Take home a t-shirt & pretend I lost it.
Hide it under my pillow.
Call me crazy,
I'm crazy that way.
Boy I must be insane.
Crazy, I'm in need,
Don't care what people say.
I'm crazy that way (X2)

Baby I dont wanna talk about it,
got this feeling in me- I know
theres no reason to deny or doubt it
the only thing that keeps me from going crazy.
I'm crazy that way.
Boy I must be insane,
Crazy- I'm in need,
I don't care what people say.
I'm crazy that way.
& my imagination runs away with me,
I try to fight it- but it's more than I can take.
See the fire buring in my eyes
& I realize- I'm crazy that way.
I'm crazy, crazy that way.
Boy I must be insane.
Crazy- I'm in need,
Don't care what people say.
I'm crazy that way (X3)---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
