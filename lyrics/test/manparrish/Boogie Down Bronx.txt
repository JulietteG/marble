Cool Johnski from the Freeze Force Crew
I came here to say a def rhyme for you
About the Boogie Down Bronx, it's a one of a kind
It's the place to be; it's a state of mind
But the guys out here, they really are crookin'
They snatch gold chains when the cops ain't lookin'
But what can I say? It's the place to be
It's where I stay in reality
So listen close and you all will here
About the devestatin' body rocker of the year

Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Boogie, Boogie Boogie

One young man born to be an MC
The only one that rocks ya with a guarantee
Because I dress to impress, guaranteed to be a hit
I walk down the street, the girls are jumpin' on it
I got the ladies on my left, the beats on my right
The ladies follow me all through the night
'Cause I'm the one with the action, the king of satisfaction
You listen to my rhythm, there is a chain reaction
It goes on your back, it goes down your spine
And when it hits your head, it's gonna blow your mind
And if you're from the Bronx and you hear the sound
Come on, everybody, boogie down, boogie down

Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Boogie, Boogie Boogie

My man Man Parrish and Cool Raul
Cooler than the water in a swimming pool
Like a R to the A, the U and the L
Pushing more power than a Duracell
And like the L to the A, the F and the Y
The hip-hop master that you can't deny
So check out the beat and listen to the sound
And if you're from the Bronx just boogie down

Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Boogie, Boogie Boogie

People all around walk around in the streets
They got the funky box with the Johnski beats
You here the sound, become a believer
Then go to the Bronx, hang out at The Fever
You take the D to 205th
Then go see me 'cause I got the gift
And I'm the cool MC with the vicious sounds
I'm not from the Bronx, but I still Boogie Down
F to the R, double E, Z, E
F to the O, the R, C, E
Yes, the Freeze Force and we never lost
At any cost 'cause I'm the boss
I'm the cash back, money keeper
Never broke, never cheaper
If you ask me for a dime
Give it to you any time
Keep cash money, but I'm no jerk
I can use it, don't abuse it, I can put it to work
Just to buy my clothes, all designer names
And if you wanna bite, you'll never look the same
Bill Blass, Calvin Klein, are some of mine
You'll never catch me on the welfare line

Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Boogie
Boogie Down Bronx, Boogie Boogie, Boogie Boogie

You've got the perfect beat, I hear you say
But you better listen close 'cause I'm here to state
That I rock so good, I rock so strong
I rock so well 'cause I last so long
I rock the mic with the greatest of ease
To all the all fine and the sweet and the young ladies
And when I say my rhymes, I know ya want to bite
That's not right or polite, so we have to fight
But I don't want to fight; I'd rather rhyme instead
'Cause my rhyme style's fresher than Wonder Bread
And all my brothers in the Bronx we got to rhyme
Catch all the ladies and blow their minds
And all the brothers and the sisters in the US of A
This hip-hop music is here to stay
