HEY!
I betcha can't, betcha can't do it like this x2
I betcha can't, betcha can't rock it like this x2 

HEY!
1, 2, 3 to the 4
Coming to your hood like a sky missle
Fergie rock the beat down to the gristle
I spit it clean just like Listerrrrrine

I'm so official
That's why I'm rockin' this, rockin' this whistle
I'm in the disco
Perky little nipples
When I DJ I turn the bass up the tick-o

The girls with the big, big booties
I'm straight chillin' coolin' out with cuties
21 and over, ain't messin' with juvies
Girls always talkin' about
'I ain't no groupie!'

I ain't stup-ie
I know what the truth be
You was up chillin' with 
Wheezy last week

You nasty, admit it you nasty
Trying to act classy 
askin' for a glass 
Please!

Grab a glass and get wet
Ask for some bubbles
so I gave 'em Moet
I said I don't want trouble
but she said she won't get
busy 'cause she's dizzy
so I said let's jet

We did it and we did it and we did it like this x3
We did it and we did it
and we did it like...

I said
I betcha can't, betcha can't rock it like that x3
I betcha can't, betcha can't...

D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-do it like me
so fresh so clean
This beat's crazy
This beat's obscene
This shit's nice
This shit's so mean
Mean, mean... you know what I mean?

This beat's crack
that means you're a fiend
This shit's hot, nigga
lettin' off steam

This is like a movie
action scene
Ring, ring
ring like a machine

This shit's money, nigga
this shit's green
This shit is terrifying...
Halloween

This shit is gimme yo
q-q-q-q-queen
And that means I'm the 
what, what?
King

I betcha can't, betcha can't rock it like this x3
I betcha can't, betcha can't
Yup x

Rock the ?
Rock the dancer
I want punani someone
gimme belly dancer
Who got the answer?
? Dancer(?)
Nobody know but I got
music to announce(?) yeah

Block blocker
Mama call me Papa
I stay on top of 
good chicks like chaka

?
I'm the shit
you the fucker?
Who are you
I'm the future hip hopper

Nigga, nigga
this nigga bigga
Why hold a gun 
if you can't pull the trigger?

Why you say you'll do it
when you know you can't deliver
Why you drink Vodka
if you've got a weak liver?
Ha ha ha ha

I'm a lover not a fighter
Love done a dyke
turn to a dick-liker
Ha ha ha ha

I'm the big chief rocker
Shootin' up your block like
Blocka blocka

Betcha can't, betcha can't rock it like this x2
Betcha can't, betcha can't do it like that
Yo, try it
t-t-try it---Lyrics submitted by Ruben.
