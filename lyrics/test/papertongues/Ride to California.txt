40 40 dollars to the man that wanna go
20 20 to the sister with the ticket
at the grocery store
I wish someone would get mine
If you got an extra dollar
Can you lend it to a man whos poor
I've been up but I ain't down
I've been lost but now Im found
I've been defeated for sure and now I got a chance
And the City better let me go

I can't wait to get a ride to to California
Cause it makes sense to go to California
If Hollywood is where it's at let go to California
Cause it makes to sense to go California
Can I get a ride (no) let's just (go)
LA (whoa) got no money sure
If you was me see you would do the same thing you know
So leave your bags at your mama's door

Going going going to the man in the back
Cut the line if you feel me
Let me hear you say it one more time
Ive set mind to break free
Now my body is getting loose
while Ill sinking like a dancing tree

I've been up but I ain't down
I've been lost but now Im found
I need to leave this for sure
If you got another seat on the bus
Would you let me go

I can't wait to get a ride to to California
Cause it makes sense to go to California
If Hollywood is where its at let go to California
Cause it makes to sense to go California
Can I get a ride (no) lets just (go)
LA (whoa) got no money sure
If you was me see you would do the same thing you know
So leave your bags at your mama's door

I really gotta catch that ride
I need to find a place in line
Im picking up an LA vibe
I really wanna go this time
(repeat)
whoaaa-whoaaaa oooh

I cant wait to get a ride to to California
Cause it makes sense to go to California
If Hollywood is where its at let go to California
Cause it makes to sense to go California
Can I get a ride (no) lets just (go)
LA (whoa) got no money sure
If you was me see you would do the same thing you know
So leave your bags at your mama's door

Interstate freeway green light go
you can even get a plane or a train if the traffics slow
I bet you wont beat me
Ive been waiting for a mighty long time
So you best believe

Ive been up but I ain't down
Ive been lost but now I'm found
I need a ticket for sure
If you got another seat on the plane
Would you let me go

(Hey) break free
(Hey) break free
(Hey) break free
(Hey) come go with me
(repeat)
Whoaaa oooo oohhh

I can't wait to get a ride to to California
Cause it makes sense to go to California
If Hollywood is where its at let go to California
Cause it makes to sense to go California
Can I get a ride (no) lets just (go)
LA (whoa) got no money sure
If you was me see you would do the same thing you know

So leave your bags at your mama's door---Lyrics submitted by Avery.
