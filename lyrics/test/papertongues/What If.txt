I need to know youre there
I need to know you care

All we had got strangely lost but then
You took a kiss from my lips again
We should stop
But were heathens

I said chill but souls too close cant escape
The scent of taking what dont belong 
To them 
They need healing

What if
We start over right now 
Come back together and break down 
Emotions crying 
Oh child Im yours now

I dont know how you stop a wreck in the streets
They move to fast in the drivers seat
I just wish
We could find peace

We always skip the space and then we regret
That we dont know each other yet
Then we say 
That were leaving

What if
We start over right now 
Come back together and break down 
Emotions crying 
Oh child Im yours now

What if
We start over right now 
Come back together and break down 
Emotions crying 
Oh child Im yours now

I need to know youre there

I need to know you care

I need to know youre there

What if
We start over right now 
Come back together and break down 
Emotions crying 
Oh child Im yours now

What if
We start over right now 

What if
We start over right now 

Now

What if---Lyrics submitted by Stormy.
