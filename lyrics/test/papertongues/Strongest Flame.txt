I thought you'd go on
Packed all your bags
You are bleeding my heart
Tearin' me down
How could you be so cold
That we are over
You're leaving our home
Why can't we cope

I don't recall how we got here
It's a pain that we fight
Time is a tyrant
It blinded my eyes
We drifted so far
To opposite sides
But I can't accept it

Love makes a woman stay
Love makes a man to remain
Love is a strongest flame

I think you know
We are not chance
We are words on the sea
Floating to shore
And the bottle, that's me
And you are the essence
Your songs on my page
And I need your message

Love makes a woman stay
Love makes a man to remain
Love is a strongest flame

It's hard not to take us for granted
And I made the mistake of not watering our garden
But I need you to know and believe in
That our dreams are aligned with the stars just trust it

Love makes a woman stay
Love makes a man to remain
Love is a strongest flame (x2)

Come back to me
Reach in and then step
Let's just start with the hurt
You can be free
I'm the man on the moon
Gravity's pulling me closer to you

Our loves of the world go---Lyrics submitted by Derrick.
