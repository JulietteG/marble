I was in a song and it 
Turn me around so 
I never heard a word you said 
And with so much going on 
Your words they just got lost 
And I wouldnt even try to guess 
But the clock is runnin out 
We dont have a lot of time 
We got to make it up 
And get on the vibe, yeah 

So take me 
Dont hesitate to 
We gotta find out how to get it goin strong 
Just take me 
No hesitating 
Get em answers to me will you now yeah 
Come take me on, no 
Come take me on, ooh 

Now you were at that dance havin 
Oh, singin and dancing 
And you never heard a word I said 
And with so much goin on 
My words they just got lost 
And I wouldnt wanna guess instead 
But the clock is runnin down 
We aint got a lot of time 
We got to make it up 
And get on the vibe, yeah 

So take me 
Dont hesitate to 
We gotta find out how to get it goin strong 
Just take me 
No hesitating 
Get em answers to me will you now yeah 
Come take me on, ooh yess 
Come take me on, ooh 
Oh wont you take me on, yeah 
Oh lord, come take me on---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
