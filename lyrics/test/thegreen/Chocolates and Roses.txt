Like fireworks going off on a New Years Day
Like a dozen roses on the 14th of February
Like a beautiful day in the start of spring
Like an April fools to watch the smile it brings
Im all you need girl  Im all you need, yeah

CHORUS:
Like chocolates and roses, you cant resist me, no
Chocolates and roses, my girl Im all you need, yeah
Chocolates and roses, you cant resist me, no whoa
Chocolates and roses, my girl Im all you need

Oh like a cloudless sky in May, ah yeah
Or like the sun it shines on a summer day
Like a chocolate pie on the 4th of July
Like a cool, cool breeze on an August night
Im all you need, baby yeah  Im all you need

CHORUS:
Like chocolates and roses, you cant resist me, no
Chocolates and roses, my girl Im all you need, yeah
Chocolates and roses, you cant resist me, no whoa
Chocolates and roses, my girl Im all you need

Oh like the leaves fall from the trees, oh yeah, yeah
Or like a childs smile for a trick or treat
Like giving thanks to the Lord above
Under the mistletoe with the one you love
Im all you need, baby  Im all you need

CHORUS:
Like chocolates and roses, you cant resist me, no
Chocolates and roses, my girl Im all you need, yeah
Chocolates and roses, you cant resist me, no whoa
Chocolates and roses, my girl Im all you need

Someone to love you from the start 
And never break your heart, Im all you need
The guy to take you by the hand,
And help you understand, Im all you need
A girl to truly love me endlessly is all I need
And youre the perfect one for me
And my girl, Im all you need

Like chocolates and roses, you cant resist me, no whoa
Like chocolates and roses, my girl Im all you need, lo-lo-lo-lord ---
