Well theres this friend that I got, thought he always had me back but recently he be proving me wrong.
How many time he tried fe say that today he gonna change but still yet he sing the same old song.
Hes trying to live a thug's life in Hawaii kai, Brethren what ya think ya doing? 
Ya pretty much got a wife, two kids on the side, gotcha girl going insane.

Now as your times start to get rough,
And ya feel your losing love,
Its cause you never took the time to trust,
the one and only man above. (My friend you gotta wake up)

You gotta wake up brother open your eyes.
(yeah you gotta wake up)
You gotta wake up its time you realize.
(ooh yeah you gotta wake up)
You gotta wake up brother open your eyes.
(yeah you gotta wake up)
You gotta wake up its time you realize.

Now mister man Ill tell ya this, well Jesus Christ isn't wrong with this, this life you living wasnt meant for you.
It shouldnt have to feel this way but when you play the games you play, sooner or later boy you gonna lose.
You wake up you get high, out drinking all night, Brethren what you think you doing?
You got me wondering why, praying to god youre alive, got your boys going insane.

Now as your times start to get rough,
And ya feel your losing love,
Its cause you never took the time to trust,
the one and only man above. (My friend you gotta wake up)

You gotta wake up brother open your eyes.
(yeah you gotta wake up)
You gotta wake up its time you realize.
(ooh yeah you gotta wake up)
You gotta wake up brother open your eyes.
(yeah you gotta wake up)
You gotta wake up its time you realize.

You gotta wake up brother open your eyes.
You gotta wake up its time you realize.
You gotta wake up brother open your eyes.
You gotta wake up its time you realize.---
