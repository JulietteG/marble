I know there's a place that we can go
To get away from my soul
And everything will be alright

The sun shines all o'er my face
Gives me the strength I need to face the world
And all I need to know is that I got you

I don't ever want to be alone
Take me away from the storm
Keep me safe from harm
And I'll be there, and I'll be there

Money man come and take away the land
And then he flip, then he build on top the sand
And when he feed, it's only his immediate fam
I just don't understand

Warrior man he pull the roots from the ground
And then he give to the entire town
And then he feel all the love is going around
The love is going around, whoah

I don't ever want to be alone
Take me away from the storm
Keep me safe from harm
And I'll be there, and I'll be there

I know there's a place that we can go
To get away from my soul
And everything will be alright

The sun shines all o'er my face
Gives me the strength I need to face the world
And all I need to know is that I got you---
