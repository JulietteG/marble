Take a look at the pouring rain, 
Last time it rained for forty days 
Take a look at the sun that shines 
Painting colors of ribbons in the sky 
Take a look out your window 
And take a look at how the green grass grows 
I can feel it on the inside 
I give thanks and praise to be alive 

Together we can make some memories 
And help love grow and live eternally 
And spread this word over both land and sea 
And help each other on this long hard journey 

Ever since I was a young little boy 
All I needed was my families and toys 
And learning how to count from one to ten 
I said my ABC's and do it all again 
And I learned how to walk, 
And I learned how to talk. 
And I learned that love is what life costs 
And it still amazes me when I look down at a keiki 
And see all the things they learn from you and me 

Together we can make some memories 
And help love grow and live eternally 
And spread this word over both land and sea 
And help each other on this long hard journey 

Together we can make some memories 
And help love grow and live eternally 
And spread this word over both land and sea 
And help each other on this long hard journey 

Show me the way, Teach me the part 
Help me find a way back to your mind and your heart 
Keep me alive and Ill keep you well 
Share a little water from your bucket to my well. 

Show me the way, Teach me the part 
Help me find a way back to your mind and your heart 
Keep me alive and Ill keep you well 
Share a little water from your bucket to my well. 

Together we can make some memories 
And help love grow and live eternally 
And spread this word over both land and sea 
And help each other on this long hard journey 

Together we can make some memories 
And help love grow and live eternally 
And spread this word over both land and sea 
And help each other on this long hard journey 

Show me the way teach me the part 
Help me find a way back to your mind and your heart 
Keep me alive and I'll keep you well 
Share a little water from your bucket to my well.---
