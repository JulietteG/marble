I can hear um in the night
When there's no one around
Like voices in my head
And I just can't get um out, no
I can hear them getting louder
And the lies are getting stronger
Someone's gotta say that

This man
This man
He's a liar
Can't trust his mouth
To tell you the truth
Liar
Can't trust you
He's a liar
Don't trust his judgement
To follow no rules
Don't trust his judgement
To follow no rules
Liar
Can't trust you

Like a thief gets rich off the bank
He steals without a conscience
It's a greed that makes him this way
Only thinking how he benefits
And he'll leech and pinch off your pay
Yeah anything to get more
So much lies and greed I just can't believe

This man
This man
He's a liar
Can't trust his mouth
To tell you the truth
Liar
Can't trust you
He's a liar
Don't trust his judgement
To follow no rules
Liar
Can't trust you

You know it wasn't really nice yeah
It's just a matter of time boy
Oooh Oooh you going get yours
Yeah you going get it
You going get it (get it)
It's always someone like you yeah (you yeah)
Ha, that never really gets it
So be gone from mi sight ya see
I'm through with this shit
Said I'm done son
I'm through with this shit
Said I'm done son
Yeah I can hear um in the night again
When there's no one around
Like voices in my head
And I just can't get um out, no
No I can't let them get louder
Stop the lies from getting stronger
I just gotta say that

This man
This man
He's a liar
Can't trust his mouth
To tell you the truth
Liar
Can't trust you
He's a liar
Don't trust his judgement
To follow no rules
Liar
Can't trust you---
