Fourteen reasons why it's nice to love you
I counted them all exactly here

Fourteen reasons why I like to love youoo
but not one that shows 

Whhhhhyyyyyyyy  ammmmm IIIIII
excited only by a look at you

Stilllllll IIIII don't know why
but your love is the most precious thing I ever knew

The most precious...... thing that I ever........

Fourteen reasons why I'll miss you when youre gone
I'll remember each exactly here

Fourteen reasons I can spell them when I sleep
but there incomplete but one that shows

whhhhhyyyyyyyy ammmmm IIIIII
excited only by a look at you

Stttiiillll IIIII dont know why
but your love is the most precious thing I ever knew

The most precious.... thing that I ever....
The most precious.... thing that I ever....---Lyrics submitted by Joya Canfield.
