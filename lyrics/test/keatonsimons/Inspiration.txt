You left no stone unturned
Flipped every leaf and (?)
With your face down in the dirt
Too blind to be forgiven
The sands of time are soft and fine
They slip right through your fingers

Chorus:
If youre looking for inspiration
You don't know where to find it
If you want to find inspiration
Let it find you

It seems like you've tried everything
The noose is slowly tightening
Newton and his apple
The key on Franklin's kite string

Yeah, you've felt this way a thousand times
The thunder and the lightening

Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh

Yeah, youre looking for inspiration
You don't know where to find it
If you want to find inspiration
Let it find you

Inspiration starts at unexpected times (yeah)
It can come as pleasure or pain
The minute that it's gone
You want it back again
You need it like the desert craves the rain

Ohhh,

If you're looking for inspiration
You don't know where to find it
If you want to find inspiration
Let it find you

Ohhh, you're looking for inspiration
You don't know where to find it
If you want to find inspiration
Let it find you

If you want to find inspiration
Let it find you---Lyrics submitted by G Got.
