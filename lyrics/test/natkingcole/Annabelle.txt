The wind throws a kiss to your hair Annabelle
But mine is a kiss of despair Annabelle
Because I want you so
And you say no

The stars lend their smiles to your eyes Annabelle
My smiles are my tears in disguise Annabelle
For I am wanting you near me
But you never hear me

I love you Annabelle
I love you Annabelle

(Interlude)

The stars lend their smiles to your eyes Annabelle
My smiles are my tears in disguise Annabelle
For I am wanting you near me
But you never hear me

I love you Annabelle
I love you Annabelle---Lyrics submitted by Bridget Shevlin.
