Does the Wind Still Blow in Okalahoma
L.A.'s a fast horse daddy, Everybody rides.
I'm sorry I haven't called home lately
Out here time flies
I met a boy a few weeks back
He plays in a band
He's a whole lot like you daddy
Your gonna like him, he's a good man
At times lonely sneaks upon me
But I'm getting by
Yeah I know what you've always told me
Cow girls don't cry.

But does the wind still blow in Oklahoma
Out here the Hollywood stars sure shine bright
It's such a long way from home here in California
Missin' you and that blue wide open sky

Out here it's all freeways, fast cars and cold concrete
You won't believe all the crazy people
Valley girls and sunset freaks
I met a girl you're gonna like her momma
She has your hair
Red as the Tallequah sunset
Sings like and angel I swear
I can't say I don't get lonesome
But I'm alright
Cowboys kinda go with homesick
like blue moons and whippoorwill nights

But does the wind still blow in Oklahoma
Out here the Hollywood stars sure shine bright
It's such a long way from home here in California
Missin' you and that blue wide open sky

Does the wind still blow in Oklahoma
Out here the Hollywood stars sure shine bright
It's such a long way from home here in California
Missin' you and that blue wide open sky
Don't forget me in your prayers tonight---Lyrics submitted by Debbie.
