I was born 3 months to early
Doctor gave me 30 day
But i must've had my Mama's will 
And Gods amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on livin' 
Even if this love's to die for
Cause your bags are packed 
And I aint cryin'
Your walkin' out 
And I aint tryin'
To change your mind 
Cause i was born to be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who outta give up
But shes just too hard headed
A singel Mom who works 2 job's
Who loves her kids 
And never stops
With gental hands 
And a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

I don't believe in self pity
It olny brings you down
Maybe the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me 
I just play a different game 
My roots are planted in the past
And though my life is changin' fast
Who I am is who I want to be

The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who outta give up
But shes just too hard headed
A singel Mom who works 2 job's
Who loves her kids 
And never stops
With gental hands 
And a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

A singel Mom who works 2 job's
Who loves her kids 
And never stops
With gental hands 
And a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor

But I must've had my Mama's will
And god's amazing grace
(I'm a survivor)---Lyrics submitted by stephenie.
