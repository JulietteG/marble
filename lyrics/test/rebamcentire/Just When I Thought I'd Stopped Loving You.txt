Three o'clock in the mornin when the telephone started ringin
I had a feeling it would be you
I didn't wanna take it
but I let my imagination think of some kinda trouble you got into
And I just had to answer
And you had to stop cryin
And I, I tried to fight it

But I thought if I didn't listen to you
Then I wouldn't be much of a friend
I let you come over and cry on my shoulder
The hundredth time over again
And all those old emotions came raining out of the blue
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin you

You gotta way of knowin when I'm on the edge of givin in
And how to use those beautiful eyes
So if one day you're askin me if I ever thought that maybe we
Oughta give it one more try
And I just had to answer
And you, you had to start smilin
And I thought about lyin

But I thought if I wasn't honest with you
Then I wouldn't be much of a friend
I let you come over and cry on my shoulder
The hundredth time over again
And all those old emotions came raining out of the blue
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin you

Oh I hate you for makin me crazy
So why is it I, I keep on takin you back, baby

But I thought if I didn't listen to you
Then I wouldn't be much of a friend
I let you come over and cry on my shoulder
The hundredth time over again
And all those old emotions came raining out of the blue
Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin you

Just when I thought I'd stopped lovin you
You take two steps down the highway
But you come runnin back
What am I supposed to do
What am I supposed to do
What am I supposed to do with that
Wrap my arms around you
Yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by Miley.
