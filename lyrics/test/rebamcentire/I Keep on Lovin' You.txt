Love takes the patience of Job
That's what my Mama always said
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know
That's what the good book says
You gotta play the cards you got
Who knows what fate is holding
At times you gotta go without knowing where your going

                       (CHORUS)
Thats why i keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby dont leave mes
And never will again
And I promises tos
I keep on loving you

Lord knows we've had our share of fights
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs
We've had plenty and then some of baby
I'm gones and turnarounds
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel
Someday we're gonna look back
Say look at us now

             REPEAT CHORUS

Keep on loving you 
Through the I take it backs....I didnt mean it like thats
I'd never hurt yous...Oh, I keep on loving you

             REPEAT CHORUS

I keep on loving you.... I keep on loving you
Through the I take it backs.... I didnt mean it like that
I'd never hurt yous.. Oh, I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you.... I keep on loving you---Lyrics submitted by Trace.
