And I'm so tired
Of these buried lies, you've spoke about a thousand times
With all your friends stuck by your side
Turning backs and minds

And all this time
You've been stabbing mine
Cutting dry at all my pride
But there's a scar you'll never find
Right behind my eyes

You won't sleep tonight
The whistle from the wind will haunt your mind
While they're all outside
Swimming to the shore

Find the lighthouse in the dark
And shine a light on every single soul that weeps
That you have torn
Find the lighthouse in the dark
Directing ships that carries all their broken hearts
That you have torn apart

And I'll never hide
I've only ever wanted love to bridge this gap of mine
But i never ever seem to reach the other side

So what do you want?
What do you want from me and need from me to make you feel
Make you feel alive

You won't sleep tonight
The whistle from the wind will haunt your mind
They're all outside
Swimming to the shore

Find the lighthouse in the dark
And shine a light on every single soul that weeps
That you have torn
Find the lighthouse in the dark
Directing ships that carries all their broken hearts
That you have torn apart

Her final words in time will light the way home
Her final words in time will light the way

Find us all,
Wish you could,
Touch your soul
Light it up
See the path
It's time to go

Find us all,
Wish you could,
Touch your soul
Light it up
See the path
It's time to go

Find us all,
Wish you could,
Touch your soul
Light it up
See the path
It's time to go

Find us all,
Wish you could,
Touch your soul
Light it up
See the path
It's time to go

Find the lighthouse in the dark
And shine a light on every single soul that weeps
That you have torn
Find the lighthouse in the dark
Directing ships that carries all their broken hearts
That you have torn apart!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
