And these streets they are so cold
Ive been freezing here for days
Ive been lying for your company
Like the sun youve cast astray
Well, its only in these bones
Theres no feeling in this face
If youll look into my eyes, my dear
Theres no hope for saving grace
Is it lonely where you are tonight?
Is it lonely, for you?

So every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon
(Im walking with a stranger chasing shadows in my room)
Yeah, every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon
(Im holding onto questions I dont know the answers to)

And now hold onto me
If you love me, do you love me?
Cause every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon

So we wander on our own
Chasing night and seize the day
Theres no time for insecurity
In the life you create
So I thought you
Wouldnt have me any other way
But that didnt seem to be a reason
You walked out
Out of everything we had
And now I find myself alone

So every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon
(Im walking with a stranger chasing shadows in my room)
Yeah, every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon
(Im holding onto questions I dont know the answers to)

And now hold onto me
If you love me, do you love me?
Cause every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon

Every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon
'Cause every night
I'll hold on to you, hold on to you

And now hold onto me
If you love me, do you love me?
Cause every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon

Cause every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon
Baby, every night
Ill shout at the moon, shout at the moon---
