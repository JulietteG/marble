Of course, its not your fault
Someone who's not you is the one to blame
We're animals arent we?
as creatures of Earth all act the same
So why do the ears ring?
When nobodys home to hear anything?
And what do we aim for...
Its comfort or happy or money or fame

We all know As everything goes and
As everyone knows that
It all ends up crazy
Like a shark
You keep moving forward
Its not sink or swim
It's always... swim or die

Black ice on the freeway
A perilous route, or so they say
Preventitive measures...
Just in case, so we'll rest assured
But you know the water
Is rising faster and getting hotter
I'm watching the sun rise
Gold and black and dirty on the inside

We all know As everything goes and
As everyone knows that
It all ends up crazy
Like a shark
You keep moving forward
Its not sink or swim
It's always... swim or die

The sounds of the ocean
Heard from the inside of a shell
And voices of reason
Tell me to run fast or re-sell
But under the waves
An animal chooses and stalks its prey
The stall and the wait is
The one worst mistake you can make because

We all know As everything goes and
As everyone knows that
It all ends up crazy
Like a shark
You keep moving forward
Its not sink or swim
It's always... swim or die

We all stumble
We all crumble
Try to fight it
Just to spite it
It's all static
It doesnt matter
If we're under
Hanging onto the side

We all know As everything goes and
As everyone knows that
It all ends up crazy
Like a shark
You keep moving forward
Its not sink or swim
It's always... swim or die

We all know As everything goes and
As everyone knows that
It all ends up crazy
Like a shark
You keep moving forward
Its not sink or swim
It's always... swim or die

We all stumble
We all crumble
Try to fight it
Just to spite it
It's all static
It doesnt matter
If we're under
Hanging onto the side---Lyrics submitted by Derek Wilson.
