Your eyes stare
Am I humble as I go
Im holding in tight
To something long as I go
Am I humble as I go
I found a way
To look towards this day
But it all hooked up
This could only go one way
Im not alive, Im not alive without you
Im not alive, Im not alive without you

LOVE IS TO DIE, love is to not die, love is to dance
Love is to dance
LOVE IS TO DIE, love is to not die, love is to dance
Love is to dance

Come around, lets go found
Theres no words to call
Tonight, you really see nothing of this girl
They work, they dont know the roots behind
Cause I got a knife to cut out the memories
So carefully, too carefully, its not necessarily
To be so dark
Got to give in, got to give in
Learn to let go, learn to let go
Got to give in, got to give in
Learn to let go, learn to let go

LOVE IS TO DIE, love is to not die, love is to dance
Love is to dance
LOVE IS TO DIE, love is to not die, love is to dance
Love is to dance

LOVE IS TO DIE, why did you not die, why dont you
Why dont you dance and dance ---
