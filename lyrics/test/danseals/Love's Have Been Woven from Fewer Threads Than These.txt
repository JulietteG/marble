Just a thread of hope
is all we have here at the start
One fragile little tie that binds
and will not come apart

If we let a dream or two slip in
that's all we need
Loves have been woven from
fewer threads than these

If we can just be patient
and give ourselves some time
We'll see our love taking shape
as our lives intertwine

We just need two willing hearts
and the courage to believe
Loves have been woven from
fewer threads than these

We can make ourselves a blanket
to keep us from the cold
Let it warm our bodies and our souls
All we need are these feelings

that have come to you and me
Loves have been woven from
fewer threads than these
There's a light in your eyes tonight

that shines right through to me
And I can't help believing
what we want is meant to be
Just look at how we hold together

as easy as you please
Loves have been woven from
fewer threads than these
We can make ourselves a blanket
to keep us...---Lyrics submitted by Dave Ross.
