Just 'cuz they think theyre gorgeous
They put their shorts on just like me
What they do? What they do?
Put their shorts on just like me
What they do? What they do?
Put their shorts on just like me

Just 'cuz they figures sick and their legs are long
Me and my girls too are beautiful
(Fuck you)
See, I heard you hatin' on
You just missed the bus we gettin' on, ay

Im a girl, one hundred percent girl
This is one to uplift the girls that I look like
Not to hurl in nobody elses world
But it seems like nobody else cares what we feel like

We live and like to have fun
But still catch on sittin' on dubs
Its Saturday night, losin' control
And half of the heart of what the shows gon' be like

Just 'cuz they think theyre gorgeous
They put their shorts on just like me
What they do? What they do?
Put their shorts on just like me

Just 'cuz they think theyre gorgeous
They put their shorts on just like me
What they do? What they do?
Put their shorts on just like me

Just 'cuz their figures sick and their legs are long
Me and my girls too are beautiful
(Fuck you)
See, I heard you hatin' on
You just missed the bus we gettin' on

They told me I could be nothin' if I wasnt somethin'
More like a stereotype
Big bugs is comin' in big trucks
If you aint seen the news then tune into the late night

We live and like to have fun
But still catch on sittin' on dubs
Its Saturday night, losin' control
And half of the heart of what the shows gon' be like

Just 'cuz they think theyre gorgeous
They put their shorts on just like me
What they do? What they do?
Put their shorts on just like me

Just 'cuz they think theyre gorgeous
They put their shorts on just like me
What they do? What they do?
Put their shorts on just like me

Just 'cuz their figures sick and their legs are long
Me and my girls too are beautiful
(Fuck you)
See, I heard you hatin' on
You just missed the bus we gettin' on

Ay, got 'em new, ay, got 'em new, ay
Ay, got 'em girl, 'em girl, 'em girl, girl
Ay, got 'em new, ay, got 'em new, ay
Ay, got 'em girl, 'em girl, 'em girl, girl

Ay, got 'em new, ay, got 'em new, ay
Ay, got 'em girl, 'em girl, 'em girl, girl
Ay, got 'em new, ay, got 'em new, ay
Ay, got 'em girl, 'em girl, 'em girl, girl

Just 'cuz they think theyre gorgeous
They put their shorts on just like me
What they do? What they do?
Put their shorts on just like me

Just 'cuz they think theyre gorgeous
They put their shorts on just like me
What they do? What they do?
Put their shorts on just like me

Just 'cuz their figures sick and their legs are long
Me and my girls too are beautiful
(Fuck you)
See, I heard you hatin' on
You just missed the bus we gettin' on---Lyrics submitted by Marlyna Bourdeau.
