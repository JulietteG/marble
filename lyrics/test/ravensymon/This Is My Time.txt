Oh at time i felt like i had lost myself 
cause people try to make you somone else
i have to learn to trust my hart so thing can change
i came onto a point,where i can speak my mind and i feel
im livin in a box,to keep the girl i am consealed
oh, i finaly found the strangth so i can leave that all behind.

This is my time to shine
this is my place to find all that i am inside i never know
this is my time to show
what i must have always known
that nothing impossible and dreams come true
and dreams come true

Oh everybodys got the strangth inside
all it takes is time to realise 
that u and only you can be the one to deside 
i can,i will,i no that everything i want i can do
believe'n in myself,but every wish i make will come true
and oh it took a while to get this far but im here now

This is my time to shine,this is my place to find 
all that i have inside,i never know i never know no
this is my time show wat i must have always known 
that nothings impossible
and dreams come true(and dreams came true

Overcomin all thise thing,here i finaly found my wings now i no im ready to flyyyy. 

This is my time to shine
this is my place to find 
all that i have inside i never know(i never know no)
this is my time to show 
wat i must have always known 
that nothings impossible 
and dreams come true(this is my time,this my time,yea,this is my time,this is my time

This is my time to shine
this is my place to find 
all that i have inside 
i never know
this is my time to show 
wat i must have always known
that nothings imposible 
and dreams come true 
and dreams come true---Lyrics submitted by Jourdyn.
