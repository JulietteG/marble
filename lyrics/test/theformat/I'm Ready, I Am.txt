im nicotine
im coming clean 
i fooled the crowd when i made it sound like i was more than ready.
strike up the band 
deprive my sleep
cause theres no love like apathy
the bounded door swings load 
and nothing it should have woke us up


(chorus)

im trying to find truth
in words
in rymes 
in notes
in all the things i wish i wote 
cause i feel like iv been losing you. 


i read you last entry
over priviliged kids keep crying
the need to fit in gets harder when living life from a shrink. 
all classmates please drop all your pens
dont write a word cause i wont reply 
and im not  bitter
its just i passed that point in my life.

(chorus)

im trying to find truth
in words
in rymes
in notes
in all the things i wish i wrote 
cause i feel like i've been losing you
each night it ends to soon 
you dont hold me like you use to 
and your eyes look like they've seen to much 
cause
its always some excuse
to tired 
to obtuse 
you look so far removed
it looks like this time im losing you for good. 


(music.)


im nicotine
im a cash machine 
im the color green 
and you should have seen the looks i just recived 


i need a reason to let go 
an intervention 
lullaby 
someting to cure me 
please belive me 


(chorus)

im trying to find truth 
in words 
in rymes 
in notes 
in all the things i wish i wrote 
cause i feel like iv been losing you 
each night it ends to soon 
you dont hold me like you use to 
and your eyes look like they've seen to much
its always some excuse
to tried 
to obtuse 
you looked so far removed
it looks like this time i feel im just not getting through.---Lyrics submitted by calen geisercseh.
