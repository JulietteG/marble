The chords we play, ways left to communicate 
these roads are paved with plans we've made
And your headboards never felt so safe 
well they'll reach our graves where your friends
And I will kill the lights and hide, oh what a nice surprise 

Don't, don't tell me when it's coming (no) 
Don't, don't I just want to see if for myself 
Don't breathe, don't make a sound 
'Cause the song won't stop till the tape runs out 
When melody has nothing to hold
I'll be the last sound that you hear as your eyes close 

And these chords remain
We'll use them to exploit the friends 
we've since forgot those friends we've lost you
All know just who you are cause I've since made graves 
but I'm too scared to etch the names
For fear that I'm the one who's changed

[Chorus]

The thought of death it scares me to death and I don't know why,
I don't know it's just too much to never wake up

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by maplay.
