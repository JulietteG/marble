I cant stand to think about
A heart so big it hurts like hell
Oh my god, I gave my best
But for three whole years to end like this

Well do you want to fall apart
I cant stop, if you cant start
Do you want to fall apart
Well I could, if you cant, try to fix what Ive undone
Cause I hate what Ive become

(chorus)
You know me
Or you think you do
You just dont seem to see 
Ive been waiting all this time to be 
Something I cant define
So lets cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet
oh its somethin, yeah its somethin
I just gotta get myself over me

Well I could stand to do without
All the people I've left behind
Whats the point in going round 
When its straight line baby, straight line down
So lets make a list of who we need
Its not much, if anything
Lets make a list of who we need
Well throw it away, cause we dont need anyone
No we dont need anyone

(chorus)
You know me
Or you think you do
You just dont seem to see 
Ive been waiting all this time to be 
Something I cant define
So lets cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet
oh its somethin, yeah its somethin
I just gotta get myself over me
And I hate what Ive become

You know the night life fizz is not for me
Cause all you really need, are a few good friends
Dont wanna go out and be on my own  
You know I started somethin that I cant stand
Waiting for the city to count me out
Cause all this time is wasted on, well everything Ive done

(chorus)
You know me
Or you think you do
You just dont seem to see 
Ive been waiting all this time to be 
Something I cant define
So lets cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet
Oh its somethin, yeah its somethin
I just gotta get myself over me  

(chorus)
You know me
Or you think you do
You just dont seem to see 
Ive been waiting all this time to be 
Something I cant define
So lets cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet
Oh its somethin, yeah its somethin
I just gotta get myself over me, 
yeah, over me
yeah, over me---Lyrics submitted by Sharon.
