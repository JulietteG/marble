-Chorus

I know it's nothing more then flutes
But something in my heart is loose
There's never been a better day

And if there is nothing more
And nothing more that I say
There's never been a better day

-Chorus
-Work that inside outside
-Work that more
-Work that right side left side
-More and more
-Inside outside left side work the floor
-Inside outside upside down with more
-Work that inside outside 
-Work that more
-Work that right side left side more that more
-Inside outside left side work the floor
-Inside outside upside down with more

I put up on a string today
Deciding never taught me a thing
A wooden box breathes the way

Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again

-Chorus
All this talk is getting me down
Nothing's making sense in my brain
I'm moving words across the terrain
Trying hard to fix to the page
I'm wedded to the thought that we came 
Only to discover our names
And blow up all our love in refrain

And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down

-Chorus
All this talk is getting me down
Nothing's making sense in my brain
I'm moving words across the terrain
Trying hard to fix to the page
I'm wedded to the thought that we came 
Only to discover our names
And blow up all our love in refrain

And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down
And watch things drop down

One day you might realize
That you might need to open your eyes
One day you might realize
That you might need to open your eyes

-Chorus
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes

One day you might realize
that you might need to open your eyes
One day you might realize
that you might need to open your eyes---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
