I know youll be there
To see the tables turning
Wake up tomorrow
And watch the bridges burning

I can see
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel
I can feel it in my mind
I dont care
I dont care if you realize
What you see
What you see in my eyes

Im over me being under you
Im breaking free, Im breaking through
Ive overcome all Im underneath
I can finally stand
I can finally breathe

Remember when we
First had the thought of living
A perfect picture
But I did all the giving
Gave up my passions
To try to make you happy
The joke is over
And Ill do all the laughing

I can see
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel
I can feel it in my mind
I dont care
I dont care if you realize
What you see
What you see in my eyes

Im over me being under you
Im breaking free, Im breaking through
Ive overcome all Im underneath
I can finally stand
I can finally breathe

I can breathe!

I can see
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel
I can feel it in my mind
I dont care
I dont care if you realize
What you see
What you see in my eyes!

Im over me being under you
Im breaking free, Im breaking through
Ive overcome all Im underneath
I can finally stand
I can finally breathe

Im over me being under you
Im breaking free, Im breaking through
Ive overcome all Im underneath
I can finally stand
I can finally breathe---Lyrics submitted by jennifer.
