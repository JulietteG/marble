Youre the light at the end of the tunnel
the beacon fire in the dark
the glimmer of hope and truly the meaning of my life
I say this with all of my heart:
You are the only one for me
year to year, in words and deed
in all this chaos the trace of clarity
you are the only one i see
my first and last, my all and everything
you are the one
When dusk falls and obscures the sky
youre the shine of the northern star
no dead of night can fade the brilliance of your light
I say this, holder of my heart:
You are the only one for me
year to year, in words and deed
in all this chaos the trace of clarity
you are the only one i see
my first and last, my all and everything
you are the one
[repeat]
You are the only one
in the heart of winter the comfort of the sun
you are the one, my love, my love...you are the one---Lyrics submitted by Deyy.
