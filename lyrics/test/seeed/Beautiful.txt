Neon clouds, a light lime breeze
Rose wine - honey we've come clean
Somehow we found our song
You play the black, I play the white keys
The night falls to hush the voice
Purple flowers, shadows and turquoise
My satellite circles your sun
Finding answers in the white noise

Waking up is beautiful - when I am with you
And I wonder yes I wonder - why it's me that you choose
Everything is beautiful - heaven for a fool
And I wonder girl I wonder - why it's me that you choose

I never thought, I'd be like this
In the palm of your hand - happily speechless
You wear my shirt and just a devil smile
Bringing Mars closer to Venus
Late at night, I watch you sleep
You saved my life, when no one believed
You gave up Diamonds for a Rolling' Stone
Now I know what it means to be home.

Waking up is beautiful - when I am with you
And I wonder yes I wonder - why it's me that you choose
Everything is beautiful - heaven for a fool
And I wonder girl I wonder - why it's me that you choose

Without you I surly lose my way
You come and get me out when Im dizzy in the haze
Im having no doubts - so proud, I shout it all around it's you babe
You turn my world around 
You quiet underestimate the height of my flight
I might be drifting out of sight so hold on to me
Slap me pinch me, tell me its not a dream now
Soak me drench me in honey and cream

Waking up is beautiful - when I am with you
And I wonder how I wonder - why it's me that you choose
Everything is beautiful - when I am with you
Since you love me even though - Im a miserable fool---Lyrics submitted by Brittany Vogt.
