I forgot love, the jolt from the kick
Gave me a thrill that I sorely miss
The branches I broke
The feelings I closed
That's just the way that I live

All in good time, you waited so long
So you could right me from my wrongs\
You don't need to forgive
The way that I live

You've got that soul
Wise beyond your years
You never have needed what you give
You've got that soul
You keep it in here
And that's just the way that you live

The streets are alive
Through the deepest red ruin
Can't tell if she's blushing, in a rose tinted hue
She's finished her shift
And waits for her lift
That's just the way that she lives

The chances we have
And the moments we lost
The river I swim
But I couldn't cross
Don't try to forgive
The way that I live

I've got a soul
It's lived through the years
I never have needed what I give
I've got a soul
I keep it in here
And that's just the way
That I live

That's just the way that I live---
