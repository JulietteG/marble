Give me a moment
To try and explain it
And how it has changed
The man that I am
Life has a way
When you try to arrange it
Of makin a fool
Of the best laid plans

Guess what I'm tryin to say
Is you took me by surprise
One word is all that it takes
And forever's on my mind
It happens everytime

I hear the sweetest sound
My world stops turnin round
Like I'm on Holy Ground
When you call my name
It sets the sky on fire
Burning with my desire
Stronger deeper higher
When you call my name

The way that it moves me
It's simply amazing
Yeah somehow it seems
Much bigger than words
When you call my name
Angels start singing
The most beautiful sound
That I've ever heard

And it starts all over again
This feeling deep inside
A blessed chain of events
A heaven sent desire
It happens everytime

I hear the sweetest sound
My world stops turnin round
Like I'm on Holy Ground
When you call my name
It sets the sky on fire
Burning with my desire
Stronger deeper higher
When you call my name

When you call my name
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
When you call my name
Ooooooooohhhh
It happens everytime

I hear the sweetest sound
My world stops turnin round
Like I'm on Holy Ground
When you call my name
It sets the sky on fire
Burning with my desire
Stronger deeper higher
When you call my name

I hear the sweetest sound
My world stops turnin round
Like I'm on Holy Ground
(call my name)
When you call my name
It sets the sky on fire
Burning with my desire
Stronger deeper higher
When you call my name---Lyrics submitted by Justine.
