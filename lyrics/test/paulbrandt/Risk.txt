i'd rather stand on the edge of a cliff
and hang my toes over a bit
and then jump when they dare me
even if it scares me, and i'd get hurt.
I'd rather build my wings on the way down,
and do my best not to fall to the ground
and then laugh at my mistakes 
cause there only lessons i'll learn.

I'd rather burn with desire deep in my soul 
and love like a fire that's outta control
and laugh and dance and hope and chance and kiss.
I'd rather live my whole life with a sense of abandon,
squeeze every drop out no matter what happens
and not wonder what I've missed
I'd rather risk.

Well, I guess i could just play it safe
and forget about love hope and faith
with my eye on the shoreline
keepin my boat tied and stayin home.
Oh but i'd never discover new land
by keeping my feet on the sand
i'd rather set sail and get carried away by the storm.

I'd rather burn with desire deep in my soul 
and love like a fire that's outta control
and laugh and dance and hope and chance and kiss.
I'd rather live my whole life with a sense of abandon
squeeze every drop out  no matter what happens 
and not wonder what i've missed
i'd rather risk, i would rather risk
i'd rather burn with desire deep in my soul
and love like a fire thats outta control
live my whole life with the sence of abandon
squeeze every drop out no matter what happens
and i'd wonder what i would miss
oh i just can't resist  the chance to risk
love and love and laugh and dance and for the chance and kiss
i'd rather risk, i'd rather risk i'd rather risk,i'd rather risk---Lyrics submitted by Miranda.
