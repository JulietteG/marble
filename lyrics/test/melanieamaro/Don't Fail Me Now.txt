I've walked the longest road
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now
I've never got this close
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now
I see you in the distance
It won't be long before you're mine
I've never got this close
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now

I paid my dues, I paid the price
I prayed for you almost every night
You're here and touch can't seal the cracks
Come build me up and bring me back to life
Baby I'm on my way to you
Tonight, I know you been waiting for me too

[Beat break]

I've walked the longest road
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now
I've never got this close
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now
I see you in the distance
It won't be long before you're mine
I've never got this close
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now

It's so surreal, won't stop until I touch your skin
Just to know you're real
One million miles is worth the time
Cause soon I'll be there to see your smile
Baby I'm on my way to you
Tonight, I know you been waiting for me too

[Beat break]

I've walked the longest road
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now
I've never got this close
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now
I see you in the distance
It won't be long before you're mine
I've never got this close
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now

Counting down, I'm almost next to you
Help me now, I don't know what to do
I never thought you'd be so beautiful
I can't believe it
Now you're here it's like a miracle

It's been a long road
It's been the longest road
It's been a long road
It's been the longest road

(It's been a long road, It's been the longest road)
I've walked the longest road
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now
(It's been a long road, It's been the longest road)
I've never got this close
So don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now---
