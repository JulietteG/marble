The world is turning black.
There is no turning back.
We've reached the point of no return.
You need to open your eyes.
You can see it even if you're bllind.
There is so much we've yet to learn.
It should be stressed.
To change the world around us.
Before everyone is dead.
Distractions all around.
Mankind must be profound.
And look at what is ahead.

We can change our future.
We can change our future.
We can change our future.

Right now.
Perseverance.
The concern.
Can't go back.

Point of no return.
Turning the pages of our lives.
We write the book.
We choose the cause and effect.
What's done is done.
Stuck in perpetual motion.
Past, present, future connect.
It should be stressed.
To change the world around us.
Before everyone is dead.
Distractions all around.
Mankind must be profound.
And look at what is ahead.

We can change our future.
We can change our future.
We can change our future.

Right now.
Perseverance.
The concern.
Can't go back.

Point of no return.---Lyrics submitted by ahmed tounsi.
