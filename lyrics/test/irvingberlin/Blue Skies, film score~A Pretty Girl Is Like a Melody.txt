I never get tired of butterflies in my stomach,
And I never get used to calling girls on the phone.
I say I hate crushes, but really I love it.
Having someone there's better than being alone.
Alone, go it alone.

'Cause a pretty girl is like a melody 
It hits you when you're awake, gets you when you're asleep.
And I can't get this song out of my head.
I think of her face and I sing myself to bed.
I sing myself to bed.

I never get tired of valentines in my pocket,
And I never get used to having someone to hold.
I say I hate girlfriends, but really I love them.
Having someone there's better than being alone.
Alone, go it alone.

'Cause a pretty girl is like a melody.
It hits you when you're awake, gets you when you're asleep.
And I can't get this song out of my head.
I think of her face and I sing myself to bed.
I sing myself to bed.

Please three chords don't fail me now,
I'm trying to tell a girl that I love her.
Tried taking walks and holding hands,
But she still seems to think that it's over.
I just want to be happy again,
She just wants to hang out with her friends.
Everywhere I want to be,
She's still staring back at me again.

Girl is like a melody.
'Cause a girl is like a melody,
'Cause a girl is like a melody,
'Cause a girl is like a melody,
'Cause a girl is like a melody,
'Cause a girl is like a melody,
And I can't get this song out of my head.
I think of her face and I sing myself to bed.
I sing myself to bed,
I sing myself to bed,
I sing myself to bed.---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
