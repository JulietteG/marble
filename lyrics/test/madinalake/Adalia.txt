She wraps her tragic moments 
tightly around her neck.
She hangs herself with them
as I try to disconnect.

She wants to choke on her life again.
She's breathing it in like a deadly poison.

She cries 
'Cause she's lost.
She doesn't even know what she wants.
Her eyes go cold
She begs the world to just let her go. 

She lives and breaths in a world
that brought her to her knees!
Now I'm addicted to her 
'Cause that girl is just like me.

I'm gonna choke on her life again.
I'm breathing it in like a deadly poison.
I just want to get through to her,
before her last breath...

She cries 'cause she's lost
she doesn't even know what she wants...
And her eyes, go cold
as she begs the world to just let her go...

She cries 'cause she's lost 
she doesn't even know what she wants!
And she hides all alone, inside the
pain that she won't let go..

Watching her life pass her by 
watching it all through her watering eyes...
But I'll be chasing dragon flies
from her darkest skies..
until the day she dies.---Lyrics submitted by Patsy.
