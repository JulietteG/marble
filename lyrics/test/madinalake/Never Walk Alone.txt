Just imagine
What its like to love
Yourself from the inside out
Imagine
Instead of dread again
You wake up
Now you feel alive

Cause you dont have to walk alone
Youre not alone right now
You dont have to hate the world
You dont have to walk alone
Youre not alone right now

You know its all in your mind
Its how you see
The world behind your eyes
Just imagine what its like to sleep
At night with nothing on your mind
Imagine
Dont regret again
Everything youve done just turned out right

Cause you dont have to walk alone
Youre not alone right now
You dont have to hate the world
You dont have to walk alone
Youre not alone right now

You know I would do anything
Wrap it up and give the world to you
When you think youve had enough
When you think the skies are falling down
Just breathe
Open up your heart to it
Let the sun cover up the fly's in your mind

This is not who you are
Push it out, crush it, burn it down
Burn it down
Scatter it on the ocean floor
Let the earth
Clean it out, just breathe, just breathe
Oh, just breathe.---Lyrics submitted by Khush.
