Sometimes I try not to hate myself 
for everything i never said 
when you were here and 
so im burning up photographs
of what was a perfect past 
cause im still here
but im barely holding on 
where did i go wrong 
choking on difference 
between me and the world 
and ever since youve been gone 
ive been torn apart 
i know that you cant hear me but im still hurt
and i wish you were here
its so hard that i try to bury it
pretend you didnt exist 
so i can be strong 
but i feel sick 
and i feel diseased 
cause everyone abandons me 
and i cant move along
cause im barely holding on
where did i go wrong 
choking on the difference 
between me and the world
and ever since youve been gone 
ive been torn apart 
i know that you cant hear me 
but im still hurt
and i wish you were here
i can not pretend you dont exist
misery is just a state of mind
hiding from the worlds no way to live
so ill convince myself that ill be fine
ill be fine 
but ever since i lost you 
im barely holding on 
where did i go wrong
choking on the difference
between me and the world 
and ever since youve been gone 
ive been torn apart
i know you cant hear me 
but im still hurt
so i look up to the stars 
and wonder out loud 
why everything i had in life
has fallen from my arms 
can you even hear this song?
im screaming at the clouds 
screaming at a galaxy 
that never cared at all
that i need you here...---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
