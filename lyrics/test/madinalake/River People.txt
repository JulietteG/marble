I'll take your crystal ball and make this crystal clear,
that I won't sit back and I won't drown right here,
I'll never wait,
I'll make a million mistakes but to be content is to be a disgrace.

(Restless, faceless, you've lost your mind,
faithless, tortured, you've lost your mind.)

They crawl in your head,
they dig in your bones,
if you let them they won't let go.
They have no hope,
they have no soul,
if you let them then they'll take yours.

You think it feels better on the other side, 
'cause their grass is green and your grass is diseased.
everyday drowns in lethargy, 
but to be content is to burn your wings.

(Restless, faceless, you've lost your mind,
faithless, tortured, you've lost your mind.)

They crawl in your head,
they dig in you bones,
if you let them they won't let go.
They have no hope,
they have no soul,
if you let them then they'll take yours.

when you die you want the world to remember you,
for who your really are,
and when you die you want to love youself,
'cause you'll be all alone.

They crawl in you head,
they dig in your bones,
if you let them they won't let go.
They have no hope,
they have no soul,
if you let them they'll take yours.

it's all in your head,
dont fear the unknown 'cause you'll let the unknown take control.
so let yourself go and let yourself grow,
don't you let them dig you a hole.

(Restless, faceless, you've lost your mind,
faithless, tortured, you've lost your mind.)---Lyrics submitted by Collette.
