Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck it's tough,so tough

Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay for love,ohh for love

She says we gotta hold on 
To what we've got
It doesnt make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Ooohhh we're halfway there
Ohhh! Livin on a prayer
Take my hand,yeah we'll make it I swear
Ohhh! Livin on a prayer

Ohhh yeah!!

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk! Soooo tough,so tough

Gina dreams of running away,Yeah!
When she cries at night
Tommy whispers "Baby it's okay someday"

And now we've gotta hold on 
To what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each oter and that's a lot,for love
We'll give it a shot

Ooohh we're halfway there
Ohh! Livin on a prayer!
Take my hand,yeah we'll make it I swear
Ohh! Livin on a prayer!

Livin on a prayer! Kick it fellas!

                             (Guitar Instrumental)

We've gotta hold on,ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

Ooohhhh we're halfway there!
Ohh! Livin on a prayer!
Take my hand,yeah we'll make it I swear!
Ohhh! Livin on a prayer!

Livin on a prayer!

Livin on a prayer!

Livin on a prayer!

Livin on a prayer! 

Thank you! Goodnight!---Lyrics submitted by Claudia.
