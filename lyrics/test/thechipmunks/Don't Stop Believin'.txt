Just a smalltown girl livin in a lonely world she took the midnight train goin anywhere
Just a city boy born n raised in south detroit
He took the midnight trainn goin anywhere

A singer in a smokey room the smell of wine and cheap perfume
for a smile they can share the night it goes on and on and on and on

Srangers waiting
up n down the boulevard
their shadows searchin in the night
streetlight, people
livin just to find emotion, hidin somwhere in the night

workin hard to get my fill everybody want a thrill
payin anythin to roll the dice just one more time
streetlight people
livin just to find emotion
hidin somewhere in the night

dont stop believin hold on to that feelin
streetlight, people
dont stop believin hold on to that feelin
streetlight people---Lyrics submitted by Eve.
