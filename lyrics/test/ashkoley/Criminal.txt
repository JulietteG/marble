It feels so good just to love you, like I love you
It should be illegal
Baby it feels so good, just to love you, like I love you
It should be illegal
If it was, Id be a criminal
I'd be a criminal
Id be a criminal
Id be a criminal

Ten thousand reasons I should run away
You've got me bound and chained
That don't make me a prisoner

I've kissed your demons and I loved the taste
You broke my heart awake
Im forever and only yours

If dark goes light, if day turns night, then maybe wrong could be all right

We've come so far so fast we're in so deep
Bulletproof, we're thick as thieves
What we got is unbreakable

Keep setting fires just to feel the heat
Its better when it's bittersweet
Yeah the burn's inescapable

If dark goes light, if day turns night, then maybe wrong could be all right
And it feels so good, good to love you, like I love you
It should be illegal
Baby it feels so good, just to love you, like I love you
It should be illegal
If it was, Id be a criminal

Doin bad things never felt so right
Dont look down cause were on this high
We cant go back cause were on this ride
You and me until we die---
