You can dance on my head, I wouldn't mind
It wouldn't be the first time
When we're kickin' up dust, reflectin' light
It's much brighter at night

(It's much brighter at night)

We can speed in my car under traffic lights
With no sun in our eyes
We can do what we like, if you don't mind
We're much brighter at night

I won't trade night for day
Street lights they are shining anyway

(Chorus)
Much brighter at night, much brighter at night
Why not just let go?
Much brighter at night, much brighter at night
I'm lovin' it, truth be told
What do we do when the sun comes down,
When all that we do, we do when it's brighter at night

We can speed in my car under traffic lights
With no sun in our eyes
We can do what we like, if you don't mind
We're much brighter at night

I won't trade night for day
Street lights they are shining anyway

(Chorus)
Much brighter at night, much brighter at night
Why not just let go?
Much brighter at night, much brighter at night
I'm lovin' it, truth be told
What do we do when the sun comes down,
When all that we do, we do when it's brighter at night

An unmistaken, just pretending, now replaying
Night, after night, after night

(Chorus)
Much brighter at night, much brighter at night
Why not just let go?
Much brighter at night, much brighter at night
I'm lovin' it, truth be told
What do we do when the sun comes down,
When all that we do, we do when it's brighter at night---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
