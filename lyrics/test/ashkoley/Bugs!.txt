Some things just can't be sold but lay your bits here
You bet on sexy thugs and fall upon a cold ear
Once a year

God carry battles a-let you in
Low style, old style
You've got to get it right here, you've got to get it right here
(I fear)

Some people catch the bug and make it big here
But all things aside, you're the only one in charge here
I fear

(Chorus)
Are you all they've got, 'cuz no one gets to me
Well here's your shot, what'll it be? What'll it be?
Are you all they've got, there's no guarantee
Well here's your shot, what'll it be? What'll it be?

If you shine too bright, they slander in here
This way, that way, there's nowhere left to hide here
I fear

Don't worry yourself, nothing to sign here
I'll put faith, bad faith, it really doesn't matter, dear
Is that clear?

(Chorus)
Are you all they've got, 'cuz no one gets to me
Well here's your shot, what'll it be? What'll it be?
Are you all they've got, there's no guarantee
Well here's your shot, what'll it be? What'll it be?

(Assorted la-la-la-ing for a while)

(Chorus)
Are you all they've got, 'cuz no one gets to me
Well here's your shot, what'll it be? What'll it be?
Are you all they've got, there's no guarantee
Well here's your shot, what'll it be? What'll it be?---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
