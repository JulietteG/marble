My mother used to tell me, you're the apple of my eye
Now I wish to tell you, you are mine
I like to steal a smile from you, a kiss from time to time
Whatever doesn't get me off your mind

Move side to side, and let me get a good look at you
Eye to eye, and let us see who does not blink first
Not I, not I

(Chorus)
All things changing, us just getting by
You're still the apple of my eye
Unchanging, always side to side
You are the apple of my eye

I feel like we got through the door, when no one was looking
But we're still watching from the outside in

Move side to side, and let me get a good look at you
Eye to eye, and let us see who does not blink first
Not I, not I

(Chorus)
All things changing, us just getting by
You're still the apple of my eye
Unchanging, always side to side
You are the apple of my eye

Let our suns shine bright, so everyone can hear it
Day and night, it'l be our little secret

(Chorus)
All things changing, us just getting by
You're still the apple of my eye
Unchanging, always side to side
You are the apple of my eye

(Backchorus)
Let our suns shine bright, so everyone can hear it
Day and night, it'l be our little secret---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
