today, we took a walk
up the street 
and picked a flower
and climbed the hill
above the lake
and secret thoughts 
were said aloud
we watched the faces in the clouds 
until the clouds had blown away

and were we ever somewhere else 
you know its hard to say

that i never saw blue like that before
across the sky
around the world
you've given me all you had and more
and noone else has ever shown me how
to see the world the way i see it now
oh, i 
i never saw blue like that

i can't believe
a month ago
i was alone
i didn't know you
i hadn't seen or heard you name
and even now
i'm so amazed
it's like a dream 
it's like a rainbow
it's like the rain

and some things are the way they are
and words just can't explain

'cause i never saw blue like that before
across the sky
around the world 
you're giving me all you had and more 
ano no one else has ever shown me how 
to see the world the way i see it now
oh, i 
i never saw blue like that before

and it feels like now
and it feels always 
and it feels like coming home

i never saw blue like that before
across the sky
around the world
you're giving me all you had and more
and no one else has ever shown me how
to see the world the way i see it now 
oh, i
i never saw blue like that before

oh, i
i never saw blue like that---Lyrics submitted by Joey.
