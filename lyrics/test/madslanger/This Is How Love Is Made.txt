Take off your make up - take down your hair
Cause I want to see everything - leave nothing to spare
Cause all that is you is beautiful

From your toes to your lips - with my fingertips
I'll cover every inch of you - every single bit 
And all that is you is so beautiful

I don't want no angel
I just want you
Someone who is real and I can hold on to

You just lay back and let my hands lead you all the way
- This is how love is made

Cause you are worth savoring - taking real slow
From every angle above and below
Cause all that is you is so beautiful

I don't want no angel
I just want you
Someone who is real and I can hold on to

You just lay back and let my hands lead you all the way
- This is how love is made

Were crossing the line
Were taking our time

I just wanna touch you baby

I don't want no angel
I just want you
Someone who is real and I can hold on to

You just lay back and let my hands lead you all the way
- This is how love is made---Lyrics submitted by B.
