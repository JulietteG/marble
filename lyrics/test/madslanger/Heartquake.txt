I'm full of fascination
Right now it feels like the world is gonna last forever
And your determination seems to change the situation
We both surrender

You are lipstick pretty now
You're so cool that it freaks me out
You kicking down my doors
You hit me like a truck
And I'm ab, ab, absolutely lost
Can you feel my ground shake
Can you feel my heartquake
And we've oh, oh, only just begun

Oh baby, you make my heart quake
Oh baby, you make my heart quake
You stretch my imagination, don't stop keep up
Dancing all around the room
Whatever it is that you're doing
You're doing it right now
I couldn't care less about the world outside

You are lipstick pretty now
You're so cool that it freaks me out
You kicking down my doors
You hit me like a truck
And I'm ab, ab, absolutely lost
Can you feel my ground shake
Can you feel my heartquake
And we've oh, oh, only just begun

Oh baby, you make my heart quake
Oh baby, you make my heart quake

Look at how you've rearranged everything in here
How could I possibly go anywhere
You don't even know what a catch you are

I'm full of fascination
Right now it feels like the world is gonna last forever
You kicking down my doors
You hit me like a truck
And I'm ab, ab, absolutely lost
Can you feel my ground shake
Can you feel my heartquake
And we've oh, oh, only just begun

Oh baby, you make my heart quake
Oh baby, you make my heart quake
You stretch my imagination, don't stop keep up
Dancing all around the room
Whatever it is that you're doing
You're doing it right now
I couldn't care less about the world outside

Oh baby, you make my heart quake
Oh baby, you make my heart quake.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
