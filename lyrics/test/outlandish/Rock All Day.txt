[Waqas]

People of the world...yeah ay yay
This goes out outland moros... my baby

This ain't average
Born and raised outlandish
That we came down from another planet
God Dammit
The boys are standard
Like Ibrahim for that
Long overdue
A time to shine would come
Then we shine for real
Stinking rock all day
Cuz it makes us feel good
Like so fluid
We so hood
Join us if you could
What could you lose?
If the beats so sick and carried out by this hook

[Isam]
Now big boy open his mouth and say
Oh Oh Oh
I ain't got nobody in all this world
All I got is in me, myself and I
Oh Oh Oh
Well watch me put my troubles and my lovers and my numbers on the line

[Chorus]
Rock all day makes me feel good (repeat)

[Lenny]
Eh,eh,eh t sabes quien es ste
que escribe con tinta,
sabor a Caribe,
el que siempre te da y nunca recibe,
el que siempre va tumbando y la fama no le pesa.
Msica viva se levanta con la mano,
sto es mi dia,
sta es mi comida,
ste es mi momento,
mi simple juramento,
o triunfo o me muero en el intento.

[Isam]
Now big boy opened his mouth again
The truth of the matters he got the blue...
He got the blue..
See if he had a head and used his mind
Oh Oh Oh
Well he can have you...he can have you,
he can have you with him all the time

[Chorus]


[Isam]
Where do we go from here my baby?
Underground or crossover maybe
Left, right, left
My way or the highway
Better yet lets not worry about it
Where do we go from here my baby
Underground or crossover maybe
Left, right, left
My way or the highway
Better yet whatever makes me feel good
