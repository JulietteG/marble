Had one love in all my life
He left me high and dry.
But after I cried all my tears
I learned how to get by.
Well, there's been old friends to ease my pain
'Jack Daniels' to name a few...
But I'll be damned if I go home
with a 'Wild Turkey' like you!

Well, I've been out with 'Johnny Red'
'George Dickle' has warmed my soul.
I've taken 'Southern Comfort'
to my sweet Kentucky beau.
Lonely cold night 'Old Grandad'
has helped me make it through.
But I'll be damned if I go home
with a 'Wild Turkey' like you!

Well I have seen some losers
who could make a statue cry
But boy if you had feathers
I'd swear that you could fly!
Yes, I came in here alone
and yes, I've had a few.
But I'll be damned if I go home 
with a 'Wild Turkey' like you!

Don't get the impression
that I care about what you do
but when it gets close to Thanksgiving
I'd hide if I were you!
Yes, I came in here alone
and yes, I've had a few
But I'll be damned if I go home
with a 'Wild Turkey' like you!

I'll be damned if I go home
with a 'Wild Turkey' like you!---Lyrics submitted by Colleen Bell.
