i never believe in the straight and narrow
always took the rocky road
spread my wings like a wayward sparrow
where the wind blew i would go
i thought no one could ever tame me
no chance to  hold me down
put your love put my feet back on the ground

I wanna walk that line
true lovers do
your hand in mine
now i belong with you
i wanna join our hearts
with the ties that bind
and make a brand new start
i wanna walk that line

all my wild and crazy rambling
those things that i live for
so easily  abandoned
i dont need them anymore
with the tender touch that tamed me
i'll never be the same
cause your love set  my heart back home again

I wanna walk nthat line
true lovers do
your hand in mine
now i belong with you
I wanna join our hearts
with the ties that bind
and make a brand new start 
I wanna walk that line

true lovers do
your hand in mine
now i belong with you
i wanna join our hearts
with the ties that bind
and make a brand new start
i wanna walk that line

and make a brand new start
i wanna walk that line---Lyrics submitted by Leanne.
