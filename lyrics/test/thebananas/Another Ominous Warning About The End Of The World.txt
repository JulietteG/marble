I used to sit around
I used to watch T.V.
All day

That was the golden age
I used to while away

The empty hours
filled my days
filled the space between

Waking life a dream
Waiting for something

Now everything seems strange
I guess the world has changed

So many things
all swept away

While I was asleep
World kept spinning round
didn't hear a sound

That I should see certain things
I can't change anything

But I'm still on the team
And I'm still in a dream

No one wants to think about it
No one wants to change their mind

And as they fell apart
It used to break my heart

Sold my car
And swam away
Never to return

Nother lesson learned
No one left to know---Lyrics submitted by hackjack.
