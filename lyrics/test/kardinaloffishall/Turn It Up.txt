Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break yea

Let me hear you say turn it up (turn it up)
I need to hear that thing when Im rolling up
That system aint just cold enough
And then them niggas sweet fizz aint holdin up
I need to hear that knock like hello
I am ready for the summer like a Gemini (get it!)
Poobah the name is yah your boy did it
When you see that fire I lit it
I make that party rock (party rock!)
At the very minimum I make 30 rock
Got a time like Tina phasin the party
Let the bass control your body
And let me control what youre thinking
You know its good for you, put down your drinking
Get up, stand up, hands up
Its time to rock so get to it

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break yea

Turn it up
Just just turn it up (oh woh)
Turn it up
Make the speakers bust
Turn it up
Let it play
Just turn it up (oh woh)
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break yea

That boom is breaking the concrete
Wake your ass up out the on sweep
So out to the middle of Wall Street and blast that shit til they call the police
(Turn it up) til it feel like an earthquake
Believe me, I just wanna see hers shake
She shake like Nicki Minaj
And so is every other chick in her entourage
Im in the middle of Dubai but this aint a mirage
Its amazing nowadays feel like a massage
And thats why them girls are in front to speak up
Turn it up, see the knees get weaker
Killioo, stereo, no ether
Turn it up, land into Ibiza
DJ got this on T
I wanna speak cuz go, I wanna do it again

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break yea

Turn it up
Just just turn it up (oh woh)
Turn it up
Make the speakers bust
Turn it up
Let it play
Just turn it up (oh woh)
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break yea

I wanna see you turn this up
I dont care where you come from
Decibels out of here
If you dont got the current youd better get some
Cuz we gonna celebrate every time my window break from that sub frequency
Let it go, let it out, let it play
Get wild like you aint got no decency
You never rocked like this recently
Thats cuz we easily

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break yea

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break yea

Party
TAN

Turn it up
Let it play
I wanna hear that sound til my windows break yea ---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
