The Glamorous Life
Sheila E. 

She wears a long fur coat of mink even in the summer time
Everbody knows from the coy little wink the girl's got a lot on her mind

She's got big thoughts, big dreams and a big brown Mercedes sedan
What I think this girl, she really wants is to be in love with a man

CHORUS
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life 
But without love it ain't much

She saw him standing in the section marked "if you have to ask you can't 
afford it" lingerie
She threw him bread and said make me scream
In the dark what could he say?

Boys with small talk and small minds 
Really don't impress me in bed 
She said I need a man's man baby, diamond and furs
Love would only conquer my head 

Repeat CHORUS 

They made haste in the brown sedan
They drove to 55 Secret Street
They made love and by the seventh wave 
She knew she had a problem 
She thought real love is real scary 
Money only pays the rent
Love is forever that's all your life
Love is heaven sent it's glamorous 

Repeat CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Denise.
