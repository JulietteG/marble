Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew.
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground.
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.

Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow.
Stairway scared and death rules there 
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around the icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around the icy waters underground.---Lyrics submitted by Mike.
