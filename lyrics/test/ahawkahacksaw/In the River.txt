May you live everyday of your life
May you live everyday of your life

Hey, I watched my body float to the hall and out of the room were I lay
And, A river ran through the corridor, it wet me to my knees

La la la la la la la la la la

Roll his bones over the stones
Roll his bones over the stones, he's only a pauper nobody knows

Hey, a river is such a pleasant place to sit along side
And, swimming isn't so dangerous if you only give it a try

La la la la la la la la la la

Roll his bones over the stones
Roll his bones over the stones, he's only a pauper nobody knows

You can't go home again
You can't go home again, a vampire

Roll his bones over the stones
Roll his bones over the stones, he's only a pauper nobody knows

He's only a pauper nobody knows---Lyrics submitted by Reila Uzamaki.
