Beats down and dirty beats in my soul 
Sometimes I feel like I'm dancing on gold 
Beats got me movin' beats in control 
Won't let me down if I'm feelin' low

Tell somebody, tell somebody, tell somebody 
Just try to make the music go 
Tell somebody, tell somebody, tell somebody 

He's down and dirty he's got no wife 
He's got an old guitar and that is his life 
He's got the rhythm he's got the jive 
And when we touch each others wires we're on fire

Tell somebody, tell somebody, tell somebody 
And you know we always play each other 
Tell somebody, tell somebody, tell somebody

I don't care what you say I'm gonna play 
I don't do what anybody says 'cos I know 
I know what I want out of life 

Yeah sometimes he says well it serves you right 
Instead of sleeping you're out playing all night 
But he is my buddy he understands 

Tell somebody, tell somebody, tell somebody 
I gotta play it don't you know 
Tell somebody, tell somebody, tell somebody

And sometimes we get into a royal battle even in the streets 
You know those electrical wires how they get crossed 
Sometimes they explode so I hit him
And he gets the guitar and we hit the stage 
And we play it rough and tough---Lyrics submitted by Wendi.
