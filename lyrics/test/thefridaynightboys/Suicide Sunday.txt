I woke up sweatin to a sinking sun,
The front doors open and the TVs on,
And I still cant remember.
So tell me where we were and what we did last night,
Were there really fireworks up in the sky?
Does it even matter?

Another suicide Sunday,
Another way to go nowhere, (nowhere)
Another day to do nothin,
A new-millennial nightmare.
Another suicide Sunday!
Another reason we dont care, (dont care)
You know were doin it our way,
Another suicide Sunday.

How many days in a row can I wear these clothes?
I hear the phone ring, I think Ill let it go,
I dont wanna face it.
I wish I had a girl to keep me occupied,
Cause I dont even have the energy to go outside,
Might as well just make it.

Another suicide Sunday,
Another way to go nowhere, (nowhere)
Another day to do nothin,
A new-millennial nightmare.
Another suicide Sunday!
Another reason we dont care, (dont care)
You know were doin it our way,
Another suicide Sunday.

I dont mean to be so condescending,
To the depths that Im descending.
Im not asking you for anything, for anything at all.
All all

Nana na na, nana na na na nana

Another suicide Sunday,
Another way to go nowhere, (nowhere)
Another day to do nothin,
A new-millennial nightmare.
Another suicide Sunday!
Another reason we dont care, (dont care)
You know were doin it our way,
Another suicide Sunday. 
[x2] (Nana na na, nana na na na nana)---Lyrics submitted by Kris.
