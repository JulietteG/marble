Is there anybody who can help me sing?
Don't let me down, I refuse to believe
That you're outdated by your friends.

So you don't wanna make everyone feel sorry for a girl who survives in the world,
This time it's not the same thing 'cos we're not gonna leave the room before you talk.
Just open your mouth 'n' let the words come out,
'n' say goodbye to the devils inside you.
I got myself in this mess 'cos I love you,
I ain't gonna give it up 'cos I love you so.

Did you have a bad day yesterday, OK
You never complain 'n' you never say no, never say yes, yes, you,
You stand the pain like a man and see what's inside you,
Just like me every move that you make.
What you do and say I think we've got something to talk about.
I got myself in this mess 'cos I love you,
I ain't gonna give it up 'cos I love you so.

When I thought it was me having a rough time, I don't feel bad when I see you,
Everybody goes down once in a while, gives everything up to be good.
Just open your mouth 'n' let the words come out,
'n' say goodbye to the devils insde you.
I got myself in this mess 'cos I love you,
I ain't gonna give it up 'cos I love you so.---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
