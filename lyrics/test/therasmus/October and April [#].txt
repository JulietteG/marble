She was like April Sky 
Sunrise in her eyes
Child of light, shining star
Fire in her heart

Brightes day, melting snow 
Breaking through the chill
October and April...

He was like frozen sky
In October night
Darkest cloud, endless storm
Raining from his heart

Coldest snow, deepest thrill
Tearing down his breathe
October and April

Like Hate and Love 
World's apart
This fatal Love was like poison right from the start

Light and Dark 
World's apart
This fatal Love was like poison right from the start

We were like loaded gund 
Sacrificed our lives

We were like Love and Dawn 
Craving to entwine

Fatal torch 
Final thrill
Love was bound to keep
October and April

Like Hate and Love 
World's apart
This fatal Love was like poison right from the start

Like Light and Dark 
World's apart
This fatal Love was like poison right from the start

Hate and Love 
World's apart
This fatal Love was like poison right from the start

Light and Dark 
World's apart
This fatal Love was like poison right from the start

October and April (x3)---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
