The storm is rising
From the ashes
Like the cruelest
Flames of fury
Like a crystal
This love crashes
Against the concrete
Shaking you and me

Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?
We could have gone so far,
Gone so high!
You broke my trigger
Gone so high!
You broke my trigger

My clip is empty
No ammunition
Used all my
Weapons on you
Like a soldier
Who failed the mission
In my condition
The message won't get through

Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?
We could have gone so far,
Gone so high!
You broke my trigger

I saw it coming
I saw it rising
It blocked my view
And poisoned you
Don't pretend
Comprehend
Baby I'm tired of facing the end

Where do we go?
Where do we go from here?
I'm just so tired of facing the end
We could have gone so high,
But you broke my trigger

Broke my trigger
You broke my trigg---Lyrics submitted by sherion.
