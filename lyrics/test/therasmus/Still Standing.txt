Verse:
I wish you were here tonight with me to see the northern lights
I wish you were here tonight with me
I wish I had could have you by my side tonight when the sky is burning
I wish I could have you by my side

Prechorus:
Cause I've been down and I've been crawling
Won't back down no more

Chorus:
Cant you stop the lies, falling from the skies
Down on me, Im still standing
Cant you roll the dice, I might be suprised
Conscience clear, Im still standing here

Bridge:
Something sacred, something so beautiful
Something quiet to ease my mind
When the pressure's taking me over and over

Burns like a thousand stars, though you are light years away
Burns like a thousand stars or more

You're up there, you're always with me	
Smiling down on me (repeat chorus)

Cause I've been down and I've been crawling 
Pushed around and always falling 
You're up there, you're always with me 
Smiling down on me (repeat chorus)---Lyrics submitted by david.
