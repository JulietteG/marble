Yesterday is nothing
but a heartbreaking lie
Don't wanna breathe
but I think you should give it a try
You don't know why
but you wonder of he'll ever call
so let it go, can't you see the writings on the wall
It's your heart on the line

If you want some more
Get down on the floor
What you're waiting for?
It's your night
Go and live your life
Just don't turn the knife
Fade into the light
It's your night

Yesterday is nothing
but a bad memory
and it's time to get rid of it eternally
You're not alone
Don' you worry about it anymore
The night is yours and I wonder
what you're waiting for
It can only get better

It's a heartless life
And it's gone in a minute
So why don't you admit it
It's a cruel cruel world
A cradle of sinners
where the losers are winners

It's your heart on the line

If you want some more
Get down on the floor
What you're waiting for?
It's your night
Go and live your life
Just don't turn the knife
Fade into the light
It's your night

If you want some more 
What your waiting for
It's your night
Go and live your life
Fade into the light
It's your night

Fade into the light
It's your night
Fade into the light
It's your night---Lyrics submitted by Aida.
