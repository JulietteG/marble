I know you're sinking deeper, every breath a straining gasp. 
And I know you're wishing 'please death, just make this breath my last' 
but there's life out there for living, 
my friend we will not give in, take these words and let the light in, 
we'll give you everything worth giving. 
I heard a story from a friend about you just last night, 
about you swinging by your neck there in the softly fading light - 
man you've gotta call you've gotta write you've gotta leave - 
get back to all your friends and all the places you should be. 
You're too lonesome man, I get it, I've been there once before. 

And I know you're wishing 'please death, just make this breath my last' 
but there's life out there for living, 
my friend we will not give in, take these words and let the light in, 
we'll give you everything worth giving.

I've sailed the stormy seas, I've felt my heart rise in my throat, 
I've thought of leaving all my friends and thought of letting go: 
but I found life left in these limbs and found the strength to start again, 
I found my heart right in my hands and found relief in all my friends. 

Don't Give Up!
Don't Give Up!

But I found life left in these limbs and found the strength to start again, 
I found my heart right in my hands and found relief in all my friends. 

but there's life out there for living, 
my friend we will not give in, take these words and let the light in, 
we'll give you everything.

I know you're sinking deeper, every breath a straining gasp. 
And I know you're wishing 'please death, just make this breath my last' 
but there's life out there for living, 
my friend we will not give in, take these words and let the light in, 
we'll give you everything worth giving.---Lyrics submitted by Elwin Hu.
