I'll never know what led me down that path, 
what made me lose my grasp (what made me lose my grasp). 
But now the years have passed and I know in my heart, 
no matter where I am. I won't follow that path. 
There are things that I've said there are people I've hurt, 
there are moments in time when I've been down in the dirt and I know that it's hard to let go of our pasts but in each one of us there is hope for fresh starts. 

So if I hurt you, if I let you down just remember we were close, we were down. 
I found life, I found this and it's all of your strength that got me through it. 

Just know that I know you went through the same shit, 
even if you were too fucking proud to admit. 
So brothers in arms, let's march home towards calm, 
towards oceans and shorelines with open arms.

So if I hurt you, if I let you down just remember we were close, we were down. 
I found life, I found this and it's all of your strength that got me through it. 

So brothers in arms, let's march home towards calm, 
towards oceans and shorelines with open arms. (x4)

So if I hurt you, if I let you down just remember we were close, we were down. 
I found life, I found this and it's all of your strength that got me through it.

I'll never know what led me down that path, 
what made me lose my grasp (what made me lose my grasp). 
But now the years have passed and I know in my heart, 
no matter where I am I won't follow that path.---Lyrics submitted by Elwin Hu.
