You speak my name and shudder, but I'm still here.
I built a bridge here just to burn it, just to light my faded path,
so I could see what's down below me, because how I yearn to see you laugh.
Oh how I yearn to see you laugh. 

So selfish were my footsteps and so foolish are they are, 
but there's not much I can do here now that I'm living underground.
Speak now my precious whispers, float softly through the breeze,
please float on by my loved ones and let them know that I'm still here...

You speak my name and shudder, but I'm still here, 
I built a bridge here just to burn it, just to light my faded path,
so I could see what's down below me, because how I yearn to see you laugh. 

So selfish were my footsteps and so foolish are they now, 
but there's not much I can do here now that I'm living underground.
Speak now my precious whispers, float softly through the breeze,
please float on by my loved ones and let them know that I'm still here...

And we sing woah oh woah, our voices carry through the hills. 
Woah oh woah oh, the whole world is standing still we're singing for the dead,
for the lost and for the stolen 
our hearts beat double time, and oh they feel so broken, oh how they feel so broken. 

Is this really what I wished for 
when I felt my feet drag heavy on the earth?
Is this really the answer I sought when I was searching for self worth?
Go now precious whispers, float my sorrow into the sea,
let the waves collapse above me, and wash away my fucking memory.

So selfish were my footsteps and so foolish are they are, 
but there's not much I can do here now that I'm living underground.
Speak now my precious whispers, float softly through the breeze,
please float on by my loved ones and let them know that I'm still here...---Lyrics submitted by Elwin Hu.
