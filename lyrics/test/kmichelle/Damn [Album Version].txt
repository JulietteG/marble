[Verse 1:]
Mama said it would happen to me
But I never did believe
I'm young I'm fine I'm in my prime
This is not the time
To be sitting at home crying
While your ass is out here lying
Hang it up you can stop your trying
I'm giving up I'm done with love

[Bridge:]
It would be nice to love you
But I got too much to do
Everyday I'm thinking of you
I'm suppose to be bulletproof

[Hook:]
Damn, I'm feeling some kind of way
Oh damn, wanna love you but can it wait
Oh damn, it maybe hard to walk away
I'm feeling some type of way

[Verse 2:]
I tried but it didn't work
In love I always hurt
Should have never gave you my number
Could it work ain't never wondered
I got too much to lose
You got too much to prove
Don't wanna end up like them other dudes
Quick too go just lose

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'mma coward when it comes to love
Start to fall for someone
And then I run
From the hurt
From the pain
Sometimes you got take the chance
When you wanna love again
