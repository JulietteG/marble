Ta-ta-ta-ta
Laying in this bed with this man
I know it's sex, but I wish it was more!
Praying when he get out this bed
He'll feel the same way he did, oh!
But I know good damn well when he walks out of that door
I ain't gon hear from him anymore,

[Hook:]
Cause if I let him do it, I do it to myself
And I was so dumb I need it, I need some help!
Cause all that I can see is she prettier than me
Damn, I wish I had her body!
I can hear my self-esteem
I don't like me, me, me!

And I don't feel so pretty today
This mirror don't look the same
I thought I liked the woman I was
But people keep saying, "change!"
Maybe they're right!
I made a mess all my life!
I don't know where or when, I lost my sight!

[Hook:]
Cause if I let him do it, I do it to myself
And I was so dumb I need it, I need some help!
Cause all that I can see is she prettier than me
Damn, I wish I had her body!
I can hear my self-esteem
I don't like me, me, me!---Lyrics submitted by Cassandra  Keen.
