Late night we jump
And we jump in the deep end
I just want to have you
I just want to have you
Each day we fighting
And we fighting the feeling
You know we don't have to
You know we don't have to

Bodies both connected
We'll be still pretending
Like we haven't crossed the line

Tell me why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed
When we know we gonna mess it up again
Why do we, why do we, why do we
Say we're friends
When we know we gonna mess it up again
Why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed
Why do we, why do we, why do we

Shades they dance
And they dance on the ceiling
Faded off your perfume
Faded off your perfume
We gon throw off them covers
And cover the feeling
You on me like a tattoo
You on me like a tattoo

Bodies both connected
And we'll be still pretending
Like we haven't crossed the line
Baby

Tell me why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed
When we know we gonna mess it up again
Why do we, why do we, why do we
Say we're friends
When we know we gonna mess it up again
Why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed
Why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed
Why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed

Can't run from it baby
It's too late to be crazy
Can't we take this time?
And carry on

We can't run from it baby
It's bout time we both face it
Can we stripe the covers off
And carry on

Why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed
When we know we gonna mess it up again
Why do we, why do we, why do we
Say we're friends
When we know we gonna mess it up again
Why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed
Why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed

Why do we, why do we, why do we
Make the bed---
