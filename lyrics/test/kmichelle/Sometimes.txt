I would run down the street, bare feet
If I could write my destiny.
I can't accept you being over me
But when it comes to you, I'll believe anything.
Just like when I believed she was nothing,
She was something, you went running.
How you gonna do me like that
I still want you back, man I still want you back

Bridge:
Oh, Lord have your mercy,
OhOhOh loving him religiously.
I should be praying for better things
instead of praying for a man, who don't give a fuck about me.

Chorus:
OoooOh Sometimes they do come back,
and sometimes they don't.
Sometimes the love will last,
But sometimes it won't.

If I could write the perfect script,
It would be on some notebook shit.
And I don't like your mama, but I hope she's fine
I think about her from time to time.

Bridge:
Oh, Lord have your mercy,
OhOhOh loving him religiously.
I should be praying for better things
instead of praying for a man, who don't give a fuck about me.

Chorus 2x:
OoooOh Sometimes they do come back,
and sometimes they don't.
Sometimes the love will last,
But sometimes it won't.

I never felt so confused.
I never felt so used and abused.
What the hell did I do to you?
Where's the man who stood in the rain?
Brought me sunflowers everyday.
Ohaaaahooo 

Bridge:
Oh, Lord have your mercy,
For loving him religiously.
I should be praying for better things
instead of praying for a man, who don't give a fuck about me.

Chorus:
 Sometimes they do come back,
and sometimes they don't.
Sometimes the love will last,
But sometimes it won't.

They tell you that, they love you
then they turn around and leave you there
it isn't right, it isn't fair
I can't believe you left me here. 

Sometimes they do come back,
and sometimes they don't.
Sometimes the love will last,
But sometimes it won't.---Lyrics submitted by LAuston.
