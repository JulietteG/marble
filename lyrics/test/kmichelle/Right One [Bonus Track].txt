(Chorus)
You got the right one
You got the right one

(Verse)
I just really hate you
All that game you've been runnin
Now it's time that I played you
And why I let you dump me?
Like don't why don't you rain right through me?
But you done find the right one nigga

(Pre-Chorus)
Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'mma blast back
You want ratchet then I'mma be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh you really don't know how you makin me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh you really gonna make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga

(Chorus)
You got the right one
You got the right one

(Verse)
Damn, I really hate you
I'mma say it again cuz the truth is I made you
Now you out here frontin
And you was just that mean
In the rain
Down on your knees tryna explain
See you know, I know the truth is do you wanna go there?
You got the right one, nigga

(Pre-Chorus)
Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'mma blast back
You want ratchet then I'mma be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh you really don't know how you makin me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh you really gonna make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga

(Chorus)
You got the right one
(now you gon see with who I'm dealin with)
You got the right one
(now you gon see with who I'm dealin with)

(Verse)
Don't wanna make up, don't wanna be homies
And when you see me act like you don't know me
You think you fly, you think you grown
Every since I left you been calling my phone
You ain't never gon find another chick like me
You ain't never gon find another chick like me, no

(Pre-Chorus)
Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'mma blast back
You want ratchet then I'mma be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh you really don't know how you makin me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh you really gonna make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga

(Chorus)
You got the right one
(you got your getaway but I got your back)
You got the right one
(that's why you lost the game and I laughed at yo black ass)---Lyrics submitted by MariahRodriguez.
