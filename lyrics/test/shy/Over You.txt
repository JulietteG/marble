Does your heart beat a little faster
Does your world turn to black and white
All those dreams that once had mattered
Are they still in sight
Lonely the fool that waits forever
Lonely the fool that waits in doubt
When you walk alone down these empty 
Streets Ill still be here
Every city seems like the one before
Is it time we made amends
These are days that never end

Whenever your heart beats time
Until that day you cross the line
Come back to me cuz I aint over you
Never a day goes by
I dont close my eyes and wonder why
You left me here cause I aint over you

Do the clouds seem a little closer
Keeps you running from the storm
When it feels like its almost over
Youre left wanting more
We had it all there for the taking
I had it all so figured out
When you feel the world closing in on you
I will be there and even though it seems you 
Can take no more through it all we rise and
Fall waiting for our final call

Gone is the moment lost is the day
How did it all fall apart
Promises made we let fall by the way
If I could live this life again
If I could change the storys end

Im tired of falling in between
Whats come to pass and might have been
I cant more on I cant go back
A lonely world that fades to black
All fades to black

Aint it time we made amends
These are days that never end---Lyrics submitted by Elliot Klimowsk.
