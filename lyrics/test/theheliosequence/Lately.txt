Lately I dont think of you at all
Or wonder what youre up to
Or how youre getting on
I never think of calling you
Or how things could have been 
Or wonder where you sleep at night
Or whose arms you wake in
Im living alone, living alone
I dont need you anymore
Im living alone, living alone
I dont need you anymore
Lately
I dont get lost in daydreams
I never lay awake at night
Staring in my bed
And I dont think about your face
Or anything youve said
And I dont think twice
When someone says your name
Or twist my mind in circles
Wondering which of us to blame
Im living alone, living alone
I dont need you, anymore
Living alone, living alone
I dont need you anymore
I never walk alone and think
Of all the empty words
Or wonder when the day will break
Or when the time will turn
And I dont break down
When someone says your name
Or twist my mind in circles
Wondering which of us to blame
Im living alone, living alone
I dont need you anymore
Living alone living alone
I dont need you anymore
Lately I dont think of you at all
Lately
Oh, lately---Lyrics submitted by Desiree.
