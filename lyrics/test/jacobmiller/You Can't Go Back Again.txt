There are so many lines you can hold in a face
That is all living through the years of a life
And a story is told with every fold
And deep in his eyes lies the pain and the grays
From long ago years through whiskey and tears
He weathered the changes that come to us all
And he held to the fight of the things he knew right
But the choices he made seemed clear back then

And we dream a lot of years gone by
But life goes on my friends
So take the old and make it new
You can't go back again

Well he heard the call of men in war
And action and pure of heart
But with orders blaring and bullets flaring
What once was whole is now apart
The spirits of all was fused in the fall
And the lives bleed away in the flames
Battered and bruised empty and used
No longer a player of games

And we dream a lot of days gone by
But life goes on my friends
So take the old and make it new
You can't go... And we dream a lot of days gone by
But life goes on my friends
So take the old and make it new
You can't go back again...

Now the crowds thinning out
It's time to head on home
The things you trust still turn to dust
The story ends in stone

And we dream a lot of days gone by
But life goes on my friends
So take the old and make it new
You can't go back again---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
