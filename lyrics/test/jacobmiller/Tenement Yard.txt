Right-o!
Hear dem say...ah ah ah!
Dreadlocks can't live in a...tenement
Dreadlocks can't live in a tenement yard
Dreadlocks can't live in a tenement yard
Too much su-su su-su su-su, too much watchie watchie you
Too much su-su su-su su-su, too much watchie what you are

Dreadlocks can't live in privacy
Anything him do, old nigga see
Too much watchie watchie watchie, too much su-su su-su su
Too much watchie watchie watchie, too much su-su su-su su

Dreadlocks can't smoke him pipe in peace
Too much informers and too much fears
Too much watchie watchie watchie, too much su-su su-su su
Too much watchie watchie watchie, too much su-su su-su su

Dreadlocks can't live in a tenement yard
Dreadlocks can't live in a tenement yard
Can't penetrate in a tenement yard
Can't penetrate in a tenement yard

Dreadlocks can't live in a tenement yard
Dreadlocks can't live in a tenement yard
Too much su-su su-su su-su, too much watchie watch you
Too much su-su su-su su-su, too much watchie what you are

Dreadlocks can't penetrate the rent man
All him a do is sell Jah Jah land
Too much watchie watchie watchie, too much su-su su-su

Can't penetrate in a tenement yard
Can't penetrate in a tenement yard

Dreadlocks can't lick him pipe in peace
Too much informers and too much fears

Too much watchie watchie watchie, too much su-su su-su su
Too much watchie watchie watchie, too much su-su su-su

Can't I-ditate in a tenement yard
Can't I-ditate in a tenement yard

Dreadlocks can't lick him pipe in peace
Too much Babylon and too much laws
Too much....
Too much informer..... ---Lyrics submitted by Elsie Louissaint.
