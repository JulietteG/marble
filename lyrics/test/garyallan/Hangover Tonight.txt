Well it might be me, might be the whiskey
We might be loving, we might be tipsy
Tomorrow morning might hurt real bad
So lets make tonight last

Weve been hanging around this place (hanging around)
Hanging on to the hope and the way this whiskey tastes (whiskey tastes)
Waiting, Wising that youd say
hell with being sober, I wanna hangover tonight
Its getting stronger (stronger), how can this be wrong girl (wrong girl)
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight.

Well I might make a move and it might be risky
Ill take one more shot if youll take one with me
Get a little closer in a cab outside,
lets take a ride (ride with me baby)

Weve been hanging around this place (hanging around)
Hanging on to the hope and the way this whiskey tastes (oh yeah)
Waiting, Wising that youd say
hell with being sober, I wanna hangover tonight (hangover, hangover)
Feelings getting stronger (stronger), how can this be wrong girl
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight.
Feelings getting stronger (stronger), how can this be wrong girl
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight. (hangover)

Cant get enough of you (Enough of you, enough of you)
I want too much of you (much of you, much of you)
I wanna feel you closer, Yeah, I want to hangover,

That hangover

Weve been hanging around this place (hanging around)
Hanging on to the hope and the way this whiskey tastes (whiskey tastes)
Waiting, Wising that youd say
hell with being sober, I wanna hangover tonight
Feelings getting stronger (stronger), how can this be wrong girl
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight.
Feelings getting stronger, how can this be wrong girl
All night long, girl, I wanna hangover tonight. (I wanna feel you closer)

I wanna hangover tonight
I wanna hangover tonight
I want too much of you
The whiskeys getting stronger, girl

Oh I cant get enough of you---
