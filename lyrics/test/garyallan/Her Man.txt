I'm gonna change my ways of doin' things around here
I'm turning over a new leaf ,gonna get my self in gear
'Cause I've got a women whos better then most,
and I've made a mess of her plains
Starting today, all I'm gonna be is her man

'Cause I've been a wild catter, and a go-go getter
Been an S.O.B. right down to the letter
I've had misadventures, I've even got pictures
I'm even more than I can stand
But startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man

I'm gonna give it all back, cause all I've done is take
Well I've put her on the back burner while I was out on the make
But I've got a woman who's good enough to give me
A second chance again
And startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man

'Cause I've been a wild catter, and a go-go getter
Been an S.O.B. right down to the letter
I've had misadventures, I've even got pictures
I'm even more than I can stand
But startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man

I'm a little bit late but I'm wisin` up
Now I'm takin` her by the hand
And startin' today, all I'm gonna be is her man---
