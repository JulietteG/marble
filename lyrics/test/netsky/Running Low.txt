(feat. Beth Ditto)

You can see it in my eyes
So swollen in time
From crying

I'm not dealing with myself
I'm feeling inside out
And I'm frightened

I'm over-thinking everything
I'm drinking everything
I'm not sleeping
I'm not dreaming

I need you to notice
Baby, I'm not coping
Pull me up, keep me close
Get me home

I'm running low
On your love
I'm running low
On your love
I'm running low
On your love
I'm running low
On your love
I'm running low

You can see it in my eyes
So swollen in time
From crying

I'm not dealing with myself
I'm feeling inside out
And I'm frightened

I'm over-thinking everything
I'm drinking everything
I'm not sleeping
I'm not dreaming

I need you to notice
Baby, I'm not coping
Pull me up, keep me close
Get me home

I'm running low
On your love
I'm running low
On your love
I'm running low
On your love
I'm running low
On your love
I'm running low---
