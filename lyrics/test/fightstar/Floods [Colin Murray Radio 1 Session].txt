You can't all pretend
That you don't know enough
Enough to make sense
All this will be gone
And you can sink beneath
The rapture we've spawned

What have we become

You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the most of this

Blood will bleed the blind
When the only thing diseased their lives
Let not the sun their lives
On the wrath of this inconvenient truth

What have we become

You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the floods seem still
You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the most of this

Just smile like the idiots you are

You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the floods keep still
You know we don't have all the time in the world
To make the most of this---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
