I shake through the wreckage for sings of life
Scrolling through the paragraphs
Clicking through the photographs

I wish I could make sense of what we do
Burning down the capitals
The wisest of the animals

Who are you? What are you living for ?
Tooth for tooth, maybe well go one more

This life is lived in perfect symmetry
What I do, that will be done to me

Read page after page of analysis
Looking for the final score
Were no closer than we were before

Who are you ? What are you fighting for ?
Holy truth? Brother, I choose this mortal life

Lived in perfect symmetry
What  I do, that will be done to me
As the needle slips into the run out groove
Love, maybe youll feel it too

And maybe youll find life is unkind and over so soon
There is no golden gate, theres no heaven waiting for you

Oh boy, you ought to leave this town
Get out while you can the meters running down
The voices in the streets you love
Everything is better when you hear that sound
Woah, woah, woah

Spineless dreamers hide in churches
Pieces of pieces of rush hour buses
I dream in emails, worn out phrases
Mile after mile of just empty pages

Wrap yourself around me
Wrap yourself around me
As the needle slips into the run out groove
Maybe youll feel it too
Maybe youll feel it too

Spineless dreamers hide in churches
Pieces of pieces of rush hour buses
I dream in emails, worn out phrases
Mile after mile of just empty pages---Lyrics submitted by Lari.
