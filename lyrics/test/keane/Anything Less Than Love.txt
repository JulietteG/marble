Try imagining my surprise,
Seeing you right before my eyes
Yeah, I've thought about you.
Yeah, I've talked about you.
Yeah, I've dreamed about you, every night.
You look good and you know it.
But baby youre a little late, for your old position.
I cant hassle like Ive hassled before,
You've got to get it straight,
Youre back on condition
(chorus)
Anything less than love
Wont do.
Anything less than love,
Anything less than love
And baby were through.
I loved you more than anyone,
Youd play your game and then you'd run.
First, I cried without you.
Then I died without you.
Then I lived without you, pretty good.
Tell me now all or nothing.
Baby there ain't no between, you will only lose me.
I been twisted, now the tables are turned,
And baby its my scene lady,
You cant use me!
(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by tac.
