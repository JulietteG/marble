You say you wander your own land
But when I think about it 
I don't see how you can
You're aching, you're breaking
And I can see the pain in your eyes
Says everybody's changing
And I don't know why

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I try to stay awake and remember my name
But everybody's changing 
And I don't feel the same

You're gone from here
And soon you will disappear
Fading into beautiful light 
Cause everybody's changing 
And I don't  feel right

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I try to stay awake and remember my name
But everybody's changing 
And I don't feel the same

So little time
Try to understand that I'm 
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game
I try to stay awake and remember my name
But everybody's changing 
And I don't feel the same---Lyrics submitted by Ally.
