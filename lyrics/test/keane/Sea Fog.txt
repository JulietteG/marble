The sun bleeds in, hear the magpies sing for sorrow
it makes things better
Maybe we'll get spread our wings tomorrow
if luck will let us.
Can anyone fly into these grey skies
Is there somewhere we're meant to be?

Sea fog comes like a river rolls a stone,
it's rolling in.
I missed my turn in the dark
I hear your voice
it makes things easy.
I strayed too far from the road
Wish you could always make things easy.
And I won't fight through the rising tide
if that's the way it has to be.

Sea fog comes like a river rolls a stone,
it's rolling in.
Sea fog comes like a river rolls a stone,
it's rolling in.
Sea fog rolling
sea fog rolling
sea fog rolling---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
