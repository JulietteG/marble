The winter night has wrapped a rag around your eyes
And stolen your sight
You seem so far away, I hope you find your way back some day
I miss you, I miss you

Some days set your world on fire
Some days they sink like stones

It's when your heart will cry out
Till your body is numb
And the night will try to change you
But the day will come

Dream hard, shoot high sometimes my fingers graze the sky
We can't hold on

Some days set your world on fire
Some days they sink like stones

It's when your heart will cry out
Till your body is numb
And the night will try to change you
But the day will come
Brother don't hang your head
Till your distance is right
'Cos though it seems so far away
You know the day will come

Some days set your world on fire
Some days they sink like stones
It's when your heart will cry out
Till your body is numb
And the night will try to change you
But the day will come
Brother don't hang your head
Till your distance is right
'Cos though it seems so far away
You know the day will come

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
