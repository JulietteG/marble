When you're lonely and sad
If you think of the times we had
Just the thought
Will bring you back to me
Seen you staring in to space
Shadow falling across your face
But it won't take long to get to you
Whatever you do

And if your heart should melt away
Won't matter, I'll find you anyway
Until you look and find a love who doubles
As someone who'll understand your troubles


When you're tumbling down
Cast an eye back to our old town
And a heart to hold you won't be far
Wherever you are

And if your heart should melt away
Won't matter, I'll find you anyway
Until you look and find a love who doubles
As someone who'll understand your troubles

When you're lonely and sad
When you're lonely and sad---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
