Is this what you meant?
Is this what you dreamed of
When you were making your plans
Shaking the dirt off?
Do you feel like you and I belong?
Just keep your eyes on the road
And nothing can go wrong

You can do so much better than this
You can do so much better than this

Ive been checking my sums
Oh where did the time go?
Holding my photograph up to the window
Through the paper and refracted sun
I can see all the things I wish that Id done

You can hang your hopes on the medicine
You can put your faith in the phone-in
You can tell yourself youre doing your best
You can do so much better than this

Get a grip on yourself
Get a grip on yourself
Could have been something but youre too late
And you werent invited anyway

Because the photographs show the wrong man
Because there is no soap star holding your hand
You dont see yourself in the freeze frame
Must be someone else using your name

And everyone will be the same
And everyone will glow
And everywhere youll see your name
In every shop window

Its better than this
You can do so much better than this
You can do so much better than this
You can do so much better than this---Lyrics submitted by Guada.
