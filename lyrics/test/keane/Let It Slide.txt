The same, always the same
Bitter words are all that remain
Of the dream that had taken you in
But all her words were dust in the wind.

It's time to draw the line
To draw the fire.

Why'd you never know
The time to let go
The time to move aside
To let it slide

Say, what's that you say?
Time to move on and you're in the way
Let's get to the end and not turn around
She built you up so she could knock you down.

It's time to draw the line
To draw the fire.

Why'd you never know
The  time to let go
The time to move aside
To let it slide.

Friends there's nothing there
You're clinging on to air
You're reaching back
To something that  you never had.

It's time to draw the line
to draw the fire.

Why'd you never know
The time to let go
The time to move aside
To let it slide
To let it slide

Why'd you never know the time to let go
The time to move aside
To let it slide.---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
