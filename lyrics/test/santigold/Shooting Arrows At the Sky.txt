(Verse)
Was the story now all the talk is in the way
She got an opinion like devil's and it's how they said
Not like the others, I gotta be on my own
Watch you fumble yet another
Get wasted like the ones before

(Chorus)
Out of my way!
You missed with your magic
Out of my way!
You see, you missed with your magic
Out of my way!
You see, you missed with your magic
I'm fighting when you fallback
I'm shooting arrows at the sky

(Verse)
He didn't want it but didn't recognize the call
I don't believe it, they'll write the ending for us all
Thinking about it, the capturers around us all
So I'll build me a bubble to build what I know will hold

(Chorus)
Out of my way!
You missed with your magic
Out of my way!
You see, you missed with your magic
Out of my way!
You see, you missed with your magic
I'm fighting when you fallback
I'm shooting arrows at the sky

(Bridge)
I know you did it and I know, hero
I know you did it and I know, for what?
I know you did it and there's no way I could
But it will hold me down, I'm waiting for you

(Chorus)
Out of my way!
You missed with your magic
Out of my way!
You see, you missed with your magic
Out of my way!
You see, you missed with your magic
I'm fighting when you fallback
I'm shooting arrows at the sky

I'm shooting arrows at the sky

(Chorus)
Out of my way!
You missed with your magic
Out of my way!
You see, you missed with your magic
Out of my way!
You see, you missed with your magic
I'm fighting when you fallback
I'm shooting arrows at the sky---
