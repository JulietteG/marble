The strikers on the take
All he sees, the throne, seize the bone
That child is born again
Throw it away, they throw it away
I tried to warn, say, I tried to warn, say
Were going to war if you throw it away
I tried to warn, say, youll bring it home
Say youll bring it home again

And we gonna waste away
We gon waste away
We gon waste away
And we gonna waste away
We gon waste away
We gon waste away

Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Dont bring it home

This dike is bout to break
And the sea is flowing, I see it coming
That fright is moving in
Hold it at bay, I hold it at bay
I tried it on today, was like I was born again
To the core, cold as the day
I tried to warn, say youll bring it home
Bring it home again

Now we gonna waste away
We gon waste away
We gon waste away
Now we gonna waste away
We gon waste away
We gon waste away

Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Dont bring it home

I tried to warn
Dont want to see it come in
Then there wont be anything

Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Dont bring it home
Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Dont bring it home

Now we gonna waste away
We gon waste away
We gon waste away
(Outside the war)
Now we gonna waste away
We gon waste away
We gon waste away

Outside the war
Outside the war
Not anymore
Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Outside the war
Not anymore
Outside the war
Outside the war---
