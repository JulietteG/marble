I've been looking for a fight
All the trouble that I know
Trying to lose the world inside
But it's got no place to go

Oh I'm armed and dangerous
At the whim of my command
I've been searching for an angle
For a cause I can defend

Oh take me home
Let me go all day
Just be here til I know
Til I know that the riot's gone, the riot's gone away

I've been haunted all my life
On the brink of something close
People know that I ain't right
Know I'm grappling with a ghost

Oh I'm armed and dangerous,
And I'm deafened by the fray
Waiting for the day I'm able
And I said it all this way

Oh take me home
Let me go all day
Just be here til I know
Til I know that the riot's gone, the riot's gone away ---Lyrics submitted by Anna Nagy.
