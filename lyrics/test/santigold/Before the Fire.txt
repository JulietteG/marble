I want it sometimes
I want it sometimes
I want it sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
I want it sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

I never wanted much
I never complained
Only want a little love sometimes
I just need a little touch
A little color on a greyscale
Or I forget to inhale sometimes

Now I dont even know if you want to stay
Saw you when it all burned down
That look was on your face
Now you want to save this house
Well its far too late
Oh, you want to be my healer
Now that Im up in flames

But I was burned before the fire (I'm burned up)
But I was burned before the fire (I'm burned up)

I want it sometimes
I want it sometimes
I want it sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
I want it sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
I want it sometimes
I want it sometimes

I dont have another heart
Dont remember how to say
I dont want you to let me down sometimes
I already know this part
Leave it for another day
Wish it wasnt this hard sometimes

Now I dont even know if you want to stay
Saw you when it all burned down
That look was on your face
Now you want to save this house
Well its far too late
Oh, you want to be my healer
Now that Im up in flames

But I was burned before the fire (I'm burned up)
But I was burned before the fire (I'm burned up)
But I was burned before the fire (I'm burned up)
But I was burned before the fire

Before the fire
Before the fire
Before the fire
Before the fire
But I was burned before the fire
But I was burned before the fire---
