Hey now take a look at you
Hosed down in your million dollar suit
But I knew you when that wasn't you
I knew you when you had a clue
Big man, driving a big car
Funny how you can spin so fast so far
I knew you when you was a star
I knew when no one thought you were

You cannot be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
No, you can't be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
I like you more when you're poorer
Your new ID is a borer
Come back here you actin' like we owe ya
Are you ever gonna be who I thought you were

Last time I tried to call you up
I couldn't reach you cuz you were stuck so far up
I knew you when you were just rude
I knew I loved your attitude
Five minutes all that you got left
Long way down boy I wouldn't hold your breath
I knew you when you knew the time
I knew you for your bottom line

You cannot be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
No, you can't be who I thought you were
Who I thought you were
I like you more when you're poorer
Your new ID is a borer
Come back here you actin' like we owe ya
Are you ever gonna be who I thought you were

Now you got a lot of gall
Tell you frankly I'm appalled
I know you know better
Where you going on that ladder
Got all the girls runnin' they with you
All of your lackeys they're thirsty and you are too
Your enemies they tell you it's all fine
I tell you better watch it walkin' a thin line
Ask if I used to know you I don't know
Cuz these days it's like it's just like I never seen your face before---
