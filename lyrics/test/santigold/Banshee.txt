Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Banshee on my shoulder
And I ain't gon' get no sleep tonight
Says keep doing what I told you
And the trouble is that she ain't right
Tell ya get out of my way
Tell ya get out of my way
Don't wanna hear what you say
Don't wanna hear what you say
Banshee on my shoulder
And I ain't gon' get no sleep tonight

Step off the edge, come on
Sweat it all out, come on
Step off the edge, come on
Work it all out, come on

Let me play with fire tonight, come on
Dancing through the siren, alright, come on
Rip it up, I'll have me a good time, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
Let me keep on preaching to my choir, come on
Will you take me down or push me higher, come on
Rip it up, I'm having a good time, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
I like what you're doing to me
There's something about it okay, come on
Come on, come on

Staring in the mirror
Yeah I think I see you in the light
Hear a whisper tell me you're nearer
Now if you leave me, I'll be petrified
Tell ya get out of my way
Tell ya get out of my way
Don't wanna hear what you say
Don't wanna hear what you say
Staring in the mirror
Yeah I think I see you in the light

Step off the edge, come on
Sweat it all out, come on
Step off the edge, come on
Work it all out, come on

Let me play with fire tonight, come on
Dancing through the siren, alright, come on
Rip it up, I'll have me a good time, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
Let me keep on preaching to my choir, come on
Will you take me down or push me higher, come on
Rip it up, I'm having a good time, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
I like what you're doing to me
There's something about it okay, come on
Come on, come on
Let me play with fire tonight, come on
Dancing through the siren, alright, come on
Rip it up, I'll have me a good time, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
Let me keep on preaching to my choir, come on
Will you take me down or push me higher, come on
Rip it up, I'm having a good time, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
There's something about it okay, come on
I like what you're doing to me
There's something about it okay, come on

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on---
