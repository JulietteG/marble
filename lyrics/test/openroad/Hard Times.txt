Its the hard times that will leave you in your place				
They dropped in at the corner, a strange but familiar face	
Its the hard times that will leave you in your place			
A head hung down and homeless, lost out in the race		

Chorus

Hard times, hard times								
Hard times, cant you see							
Hard times, hard times								
Hard times, let me be								

So we sat down and we watched the lights go by			
And no one cared to notice when he crawled up there and he died  
But a hobos life it really aint worthwhile 				
Bag him up and drag him down for one last place to hide	

Chorus

solo breaks     verse chords

Do they wonder as life goes driftin by					
Stackin up to nothing means you let your dreams just slide	
Do they wonder what goes on deep inside				
Do they see a hobo lost out in the night					

Chorus

Its the hard times that will leave you in your place---Lyrics submitted by Richard Carey.
