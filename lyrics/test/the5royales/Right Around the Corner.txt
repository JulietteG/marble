Right around the corner, that's where my baby stays. 
Right around the corner, that's where my baby stays. 
And I can get to my honey's house 15 different ways. 

Well I can go around the side, 
I can cut through the back. 
I broke a picket off the fence 
so I can squeeze through the crack.

Right around the corner, that's where my baby stays. 
Right around the corner, that's where my baby stays. 
And I can get to my honey's house 15 different ways. 

I consider myself lucky, 
just as lucky as can be. 
And I want to thank my baby 
cause she moved so close to me.

Right around the corner, that's where my baby stays. 
Right around the corner, that's where my baby stays. 
And I can get to my honey's house 15 different ways.---Lyrics submitted by Justin Kayce.
