I'm a little bit worse for wear
Got a little bit more grey hair
I'm not gonna be the next big thing
But I'm getting fitted for a new brass ring
I've been dunked, I've been kicked around
Now I'm ready for the big rebound
I know you can't win them all
But I'm swingin' like Pitt gettin' hits in Moneyball

Get back, get back up
You gotta get back, get back up
You got a whole stadium on their feet
It's not about a victory or a defeat
See you gotta get back, get back up
You gotta get back, get back up

Not everything is sink or swim
You can't fly if the air's too thin
The best part of the ride is the free fall
Better keep your arms and legs in the vehicle
Standing eight and I'm on the ropes
Knees givin' but I won't lose hope
Not the second coming of Muhammad Ali
But can I get a "WOOT" for the boxing imagery?

Get back, get back up
You gotta get back, get back up
You got a whole stadium on their feet
It's not about a victory or a defeat
See you gotta get back, get back up
You gotta get back, get back up

Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back

Get back, get back up
You gotta get back, get back up
You got a whole stadium on their feet
It's not about a victory or a defeat
See you gotta get back, get back up
You gotta get back, get back up
Everybody's up on their feet
It's not about a victory or a defeat
See you gotta get back, get back up
You gotta get back, get back up

Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back
Gotta get back, gotta get back---
