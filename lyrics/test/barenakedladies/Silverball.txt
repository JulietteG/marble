Roll around, and I stare at you,
Your lights and sound, am I scared of you?
You could take me down like you're set to do,
But hear me now, I'll take care of you.

Light me up, and knock me down,
I'm free game whenever you're around,
So lock me in, we're special bound,
'Cause you're my silverball.

Had it all, there and back again,
I destroyed the ring on the attack again,
The multi-ball was on track again,
But I watched it fall through the center drain.

Light me up, and knock me down,
I'm free game whenever you're around,
So lock me in, we're special bound,
'Cause you're my silverball.

Silence is fine, but you won't play me blind,
Drops in a line reset every time,
I'll change your mind if I nudge you oh-so carefully,

Settin' up, hittin' shots again,
Gettin' tough, making locks again,
If you've seen one, then they're all the same,
Just shoot the lights, and avoid our lanes.

Light me up, and knock me down,
I'm free game whenever you're around,
So lock me in, we're special bound,
'Cause you're my silverball.

Light me up, and knock me down,
I'm free game whenever you're around,
So lock me in, we're special bound,
'Cause you're my silverball.---
