Hello city, hey

Another night at the Palace, 'cause there is nothing else to do. Oh-woah, ah-hah
The same people, the same drinks and the same music, the same quicksand
I think this harbour town is waist deep and sinking fast.

Hello city, you've found an enemy in me. Woah-oh, woah-oh [Andy Scatting]
Hello city, (Hello city). Hello city, hey

Second night at the Warehouse, and my mock turtleneck just reeks. Woah-oh, woah-oh
From the liquor room up to the changeroom
To the doom and gloom of the hotel room,
I wish this seaside beerhall would sink into the bay.
Hello city, you've found an enemy in me. Woah-oh, woah-oh [Andy Scatting]
Hello city, (Hello city). Hello city.

Maybe I caught you at a bad time, (wat'up)
Maybe I should call you back next week, (wat'up)
maybe half the fault is mine that (wat'up) the sun didn't shine on Barrington Street.

It's three o'clock in the morning, and I'm hungry so let's eat. Woah-oh, woah-oh.
Climb down three flights to the streetlights
and the barfights, we're just taking in the sights.
I hope tomorrow that I wake up in my own bed.

Hello city, oo, you've found an enemy in me. Woah-oh, woah-oh [Andy Scatting]
Hello city, (Hello city). Hello city, hey

What a good place to be, Don't believe them,
'Cause they speak a different language, and it's never been happy for me. (It's happy hour again)
Woah-oh, woah-oh - It's happy hour again
Woah-oh, woah-oh - Hello city, hey
Woah-oh, woah-oh - Hello city - hey---Lyrics submitted by Davis.
