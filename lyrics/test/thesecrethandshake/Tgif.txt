the year was 1995
and i was too young to drive
i felt stuck on the inside, of my life

just livin' out my life through my TV,
with all my favorite shows
wanted my life to work out so easy,
don't care if anybody knows

but now I'm old enough to drive
no one can keep me inside
and i got the day on my mind
its my life

Step By Step, these are Family Matters 
and why Boy Meets World, Ill never ever know 
Whos the Boss here? Its a Fresh Prince. 
We got a Full House, let's get the show on the road. 

Just livin out my life through my TV 
with all my favorite shows. 
Wanted my life to work out so easy 
Dont care if anybody knows. Yeah 

But now I'm old enough to drive. 
No one can keep me inside. 
Now I got the day on my mind. 
Its my life. Whoa Whoa 

But now I'm old enough to drive. 
No one can keep me inside. 
Now I got the day on my mind. 
Its my life. Whoa Whoa 

I just wanna live my life like it''s the 90's 
Like its a TV show 
there could be problems but we would solve them 
on next weeks episode 

I just wanna live my life like it's the 90's 
Like its a TV show 
there could be problems but we would solve them 
on next weeks episode 

But now I'm old enough to drive. 
No one can keep me inside. 
Now I got the day on my mind. 
Its my life. Whoa Whoa 

But now I'm old enough to drive. 
No one can keep me inside. 
Now I got the day on my mind. 
Its my life. Whoa Whoa
