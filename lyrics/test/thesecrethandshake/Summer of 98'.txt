I wrote some songs cause I 
love her
Then played some shows in 
the suburbs
It was the middle of summer
In Texas

I was feeling pretty good then
Everything worked out at
school then
I was feeling like a champ in
summer

This This could be the
summer, the summer of
love
And this this could be the
summer when I grow up

I wanted to be just like him
He looked just like all the
cool kids
I wanted to wear what he wore
in summer

I was feeling pretty good then
Everything worked our at
school then
I was feeling like champ in
summer

Okay

This, This could be the summer, 
The summer of love
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
(x2)

Its never been like this
I am just starting over
(x2)

This, this could be, the 
summer the summer of love
And this, this could be the 
summer when I grow up
(x2)---Lyrics submitted by Symone.
