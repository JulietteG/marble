This whole routine is getting old
So am I and so are you.
My reputation lets me know I can do whatever I want to
Though it seems that you believe you can do whatever it is you please
Not before, not before you wind up on your knees.

(Don't cry to me no more)
You like the way the people stare at you now
You look so fake, just thought that you should know
And you're all the same and when the curtain drops down
You'll be replaced by something typical.

You set yourself up to be sold.
And that's okay cause that's your role.
Manipulation takes it toll.
What will you do when nobody wants you?
Though it seems that you believe you can do whatever it is you please
Not before, not before you wind up on your knees.

(Don't cry to me no more)
You like the way the people stare at you now
You look so fake, just thought that you should know
And you're all the same and when the curtain drops down
You'll be replaced by something typical.

I know I stood so long beside you
And I know I should have left you right where I have found you
I know I stood so long beside you
And I know I should have left you right where I have found you

You like the way the people the stare at you now
You look so fake, just thought that you should know
And you're all the same and when the curtain drops down
You'll be replaced by something typical.

You like the way the people the stare at you now
You look so fake, just thought that you should know
And you're all the same and when the curtain drops down
You'll be replaced by something typical.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
