I remember a year ago I was standing in the crowd 
waiting for my chance to break through, my chance to live again. 

Now it seems I've found some friends who finally understand what it takes 
to make this dream come true, we'll be here till the end. 

Shake it, break it, get off your feet, 
come dance with me and don't you fake it. 

Shake it, break it get off your feet, 
get close to me and don't you fake it. 

Shout and scream my friends, connect with me and we'll pretend 
this night will never end (wo oh) this night will never end. 
Just let go you'll see together we'll do anything 
this night will never end wo oh this night will never end. 

Oh, wish I could thank you all for what you have done 
and all of the things that you have shared with me. 
Oh, wish I could take you all too where I must go wish I could take you all 
I'll take you with my heart. 

"Dance, get on the floor, shake, get on the floor, break, get on the floor" 
(repeat) 

Shake it, break it, get off your feet 
come dance with me and don't you fake it 
Shake it, break it get off your feet 
get close to me and don't you fake it. 

I'm reaching out here to show you what we've been through 
I think there's something we can share, that's completely new 
or maybe I'm just insane 
Shake it break it get off your feet---Lyrics submitted by denise.
