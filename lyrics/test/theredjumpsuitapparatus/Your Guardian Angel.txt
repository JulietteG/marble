When I see your smile, 
Tears run down my face.
I can't replace.
And now that I'm strong, I have figured out, 
How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul.
And I know I'll find deep inside me, 
I can be the one.

I will never let you fall. 
I'll stand up with you forever.
I'll be there for you through it all. 
Even if saving you sends me to heaven.

It's okay, 
It's okay, 
It's okay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

Seasons are changing, 
And waves are crashing, 
And stars are falling all for us.
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter, 
I can show you I'll be the one 

I will never let you fall. 
I'll stand up with you forever.
I'll be there for you through it all.
Even if saving you sends me to heaven.

'Cause you're my, you're my, my-e-y-e-y, 
My true love, my whole heart.
Please don't throw that away.
'Cause I'm here... for you! 
Please don't walk away and, 
Please tell me you'll stay... here! 

Whoa-oh! 
Stay! 
Whoa-oh! 

Use me as you will! 
Pull my strings just for a thrill! 
And I know I'll be okay, 
Though my skies are turning grey! (grey!)  

I will never let you fall! 
I'll stand up with you forever! 
I'll be there for you through it all, 
Even if saving you sends me to heaven! 

I will never let you fall! 
I'll stand up with you forever! 
I'll be there for you through it all, 
Even if saving you sends me to heaven! (continues until fades out)---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
