Hey girl you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my hand
Still I never understand why you hang around
I see what's going down

Cover up with make up in the mirror
Tell yourself it's never going to happen again
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you

Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, and new life she has found

A pebble in the water makes a ripple effects
Every action in this world will bear a consequence
If you wade around forever you will surely down
I see what's going down

I see the way you go and say you're right again
Say you're right again
Heed my lecture

Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, and new life she has found

Face down in the dirt
She said "This doesn't hurt"
She said "I finally had enough"
(Repeat)

One day she will tell you that she has had enough
It's coming around again

Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, and new life she has found

Do you feel like a maaaaaaan.. When you push her arooooound?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, and new life she has found

Face down in the dirt
She said "This doesn't hurt"
She said "I finally had enough"---Lyrics submitted by Yolla.
