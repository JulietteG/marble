You know that you are 
The center of my attention 
And you leave me no choice
Tripping on to the floor
Looking at my reflection 
As I follow the chord to your voice 
As it rings on through
Your voice clearly receptive like the day we met I knew

Don't hang up on me 'cause I'm hung up on you
Don't tell me how to feel like you always do
I know you're right, I don't wanna fight
Is this how our story ends or a new chapter begins?

As the days roll by
Can't help myself just sit and wonder why
Was it something I said?
Something I did? My girl
Your wilted roses make me cry
A sentimental sign of rejection 
As I follow the chord to your voice 
As it rings on through
Your voice clearly receptive like the day we met I knew

Don't hang up on me 'cause I'm hung up on you
Don't tell me how to feel like you always do
I know you're right, I don't wanna fight
Is this how our story ends or a new chapter begins?
Begins...

(Missing Lyrics)

Don't hang up on me 'cause I'm hung up on you
Don't tell me how to feel like you always do
I know you're right, I don't wanna fight
Is this how our story ends or a new chapter begins?
