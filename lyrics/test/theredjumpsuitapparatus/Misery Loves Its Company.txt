Listen close, as the rain falls down to the ground
It's true, we are
We are destined to fail 
It's true, we are
We are destined to fail

There is a problem here, with our society
The absence of my tears is my sobriety
I have a growing fear and your not helping me
Am I the only one who realizes its true?

Beat but I'm not broken
Guide me through with your hand
Lead with your words spoken
Show me how to listen

You're persecuting me, showing hypocrisy
I have a remedy for your insecurity
It's all the same, sadly, 
Nobody works for free
Am I the only one who realizes its true?

Beat but I'm not broken
Guide me through with your hand
Lead with your words spoken
Show me how to listen

Let your light shine through me
Take this hate I can't release
Help me make the blind see,
Misery loves its company

When I dream, I see dawn turn, 
into dusk, into dusk

Beat but I'm not broken
Guide me through with your hand
Lead with your words spoken
Show me how to listen

Let your light shine through me
Take this hate I can't release
Help me make the blind see,
Misery loves its company

It's true, we are
We are destined to fail
It's true, we are
we are destined to fail---Lyrics submitted by John Raphael.
