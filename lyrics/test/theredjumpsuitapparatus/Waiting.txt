Feeling sorrow
for all the things you had to steal and borrow.
Bring back the days we had before tomorrow
relapse and then collapse into yourself once more.

Waiting for this life to change seems like it's taking me forever
and I can't hold on. This life is breaking into the day
This life is going to change seems like it's taking me forever
And I can't hold on. This life is breaking into the day

Void I can't fill.
The doctor tells me to relax and stand still
Prescribes me a new pill to quell my anger.
Wish I could make her pull herself up off the floor

Waiting for this life to change seems like it's taking me forever
and I can't hold on. This life is breaking into the day
This life is going to change seems like it's taking me forever
And I can't hold on. This life is breaking into the day
Again, into the day, again

Waiting for this life to change seems like it's taking me forever
and I can't hold on. This life is breaking into the day
This life is going to change seems like it's taking me forever
And I can't hold on. This life is breaking into the day

Take time to contemplate who you are and where you want to go.
