Oh my eyes
oh closing slowly

Don't you try to take me down,
don't you try to take me over,
won't you try to break me?

The complexities moving in,
and I feel that I do not have the strength,
tragedies plaguing me solemnly
It's affecting my will

But wait, now that I've found you,
situations from dark now change to gray
Disregarding my absence of memories,
it's perpetually blinding me of sanity,
and just when I'm giving in,
as I try to scale these walls
Jericho falls around me
and I feel that I've strayed too long

And darkness is fading in, and darkness is real

Oh my eyes
oh closing slowly
I try

Fate seems to recreate,
I just cannot escape,
Something holds me down and makes me
act a way I can't explain
Even now I can feel it coming over me choking me,
as I'm falling behind
You can say you know me,
but you have no clue what my dreams could show you

And darkness is fading in, and darkness is real

Oh my eyes
oh closing slowly
I try

I
Can't
Can't win
...Tell me what you see.

I feel something deep inside me,
I feel deep inside...me!
I feel something deep inside me
and I can't let this go, whoa, (can't let this go)
I feel something deep inside me
and I can't let this go, whoa,

Lie, as I try to steer clear, and I try to stay sober
This is taking me over,
And my dreams complicate it...

I just cannot let this go
I tried so many times to tell you
I just I cannot let this go,
I just cannot win

I see you
I see you...you falling away
I see you...you
You... killing me softly
I see you...you falling away
I see you...you...you

Don't take what's in front of me,
open eyes can see I have everything
Tell you, don't take what's in front of me,
tell you, don't take what's in me

Lie, which one lied?
When I feel this come away,
Way-ooahh
that's why I try...lie

[Crowd singing]
Whoaa..ohh..ohhh...

I see you coming my way
dreams may fall more everyday
But I see you looking my way

And I've tried just to separate dreams from reality
Try to satisfy this wanting,
Try to stay righteous, try to stay sober,
but then, I can't win

And I know you, and I know you, and I know you...

Lie!---Lyrics submitted by toinks.
