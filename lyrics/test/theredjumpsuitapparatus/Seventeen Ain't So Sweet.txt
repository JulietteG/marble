Well she never was the best
Yeah at following the trends
Stayed one step above the rest

And even though it seemed
Like the world was crashing on her
Didn't let it hold her down, didn't hold her back
Oh no
Woah

Don't worry you'll show them

There's a fire in your eyes 
And I hope you let it burn (hope you let it burn)
There's a scream in your voice 
And I hope you will be heard (hope you will be heard)
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you let it burn until you're heard
You're heard

Seventeen is just a test
Yeah and I would recommend
That you live with no regrets

And even if it seems
Like the world is crashing on you
You shouldn't let it hold you down
Shouldn't hold you back
Oh no
Woah

Don't worry you'll show them

Theres a fire in your eyes
And I hope you let it burn (hope you let it burn)
There's a scream in your voice
And I hope you will be heard (hope you will be heard)
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you let it burn until you're heard
You're heard

Relax girl
Turn down the lights
No one can see you shining
Relax girl
It'll be alright
No one can stop you if you try

Point of rhythm is to follow it in time
To listen to the beating in your mind
Remember if you seek then you shall find
Woah oh

There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you let it burn (hope you let it burn)
There's a scream in your voice
And I hope you will be heard (hope you will be heard)
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you let it burn until you're heard
You're Heard

There's a fire in your eyes (your eyes)
And I hope you let it burn 
There's a scream in your voice (your eyes)
And I hope you will be heard 
There's a fire in your eyes
And I hope you let it burn until you're heard

Until you're heard
Until you're heard---Lyrics submitted by Kelli.
