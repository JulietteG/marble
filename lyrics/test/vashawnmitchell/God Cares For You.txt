God Cares For You

I know you feel discouraged
Seems like life had got the best of you
And every time you turn around
Something else has got you down
But theres one thing you need to know
And Im here to encourage you...

God Cares For you, Yes he cares For you

All though sometimes you have to cry
Over things you cant explain
You find your faith being tested
But still you must trust Gods Heart
he may not come when you want him
but hes always right on time

God Cares For you, Yes, he cares For you

So, when you go thru lifes trials
Its alright, Hes there
Even when you can not feel him
Trust his heart and know he cares

He will Never leave you alone
Hell never forsake you for youre his own

God Cares For you, Yes, he cares For you
God Cares For you, Yes, he cares For you
God Cares For you, Yes, he cares For you

(talking-music break)

He Knows, He Cares, and hes always There (x4)
He Knows, He Cares, and hes always There (x10) **inverted

God Cares For you, Yes, he cares For you
God Cares For you, Yes, he cares For you---Lyrics submitted by Rachel Lee.
