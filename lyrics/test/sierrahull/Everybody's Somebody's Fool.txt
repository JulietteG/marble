The tears I cry for you, could fill an ocean.
But you don't care how many tears I cry.
And though you only lead me on and hurt me.
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye.

Cause everybody's somebody's fool.
Everybody's somebody's baby.
there ain't no exception to the rule.
Cause everybody's somebody's fool.

I told myself it's best that I forget you
Though I'm a fool at least I know the score
Yet darlin' I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts but I come runnin' back for more

Cause everybody's somebody's fool.
Everybody's somebody's baby.
there ain't no exception to the rule.
Cause everybody's somebody's fool.

Someday you'll find someone you really care for.
And if her love should prove to be untrue.
You'll know how much this heart of mine is breaking.
You'll cry for her the way i've cried for you.

Cause everybody's somebody's fool.
Everybody's somebody's baby.
And there ain't no exceptions to the rule.
Cause everybody's somebody's fool.---Lyrics submitted by morgan.
