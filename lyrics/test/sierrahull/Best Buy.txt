You can buy me the best
Say you love me like the rest
But don't think I'm gonna buy the words you say
You can tell me your sweet lies
With those pretty big blue eyes
But don't think I'm gonna give my heart away
You can tell me things untrue
Say you want me like you do
That you'll always be the one that's by my side
But I won't buy it; I'll deny it 
'Cause I know it isn't true
'Cause a million times I've heard these lies from you

(2x)
You're gonna give your all and do your best
Make me the happiest girl that's ever known a love so true
Tell me that you love me so and you will never let me go
But I know it isn't so
'Cause the best that you can buy
Don't ya think it's gonna fly 
Fly over like the lies I've bought before
'Cause you can take your stuff; I've had enough
I'll even hold the door
'Cause I ain't gonna buy it anymore---Lyrics submitted by Hayden Bourassa.
