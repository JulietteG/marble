I looked for you
in everything
that can't be held
that can't be seen
hear me
call
?(floatin' eye)?
drenched in white
crush the hand
held too tight
wake up
be
free
strange now
that i can see
all the things
I'll never be
love what you have
not what you need
the walls are thin
I hear it all
let us lye 
out too long
weigh me
down
darkness watch
over me
I let it in
it let me be
hear me
call
at least
I know the ?(burnt
hair and teeth)?
I'll never see
what's underneath
love what you had
not what you need
and suddenly
it's everything
all of the things
I'll never be
I close my eyes
and i can see you, so pristine
so pristine
so pristine
so pristine
so pristine
so pristine---Lyrics submitted by jasen graham.
