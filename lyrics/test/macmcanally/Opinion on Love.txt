Well he met her in the winter of the seventh grade
And he swore that they were in love
And he held her hand in an oak tree shade
At the time that was enough
And they stood and they kissed for a minute
And he saw her three times a week
And she made him feel so good that he could not speak
But the strength that grew between them made him weak

So he left her in the summer of his junior year
When he felt a little more secure
And when the sun came out and all the legs appeared
He might love her but he couldn't be sure
'til he chased the ones that were the tannest
And he took all that he could find
And i used to sit and talk to him sometimes
And i asked him once what made him change his mind

He told me "when the Mississippi sun shines down on you brother
It'll change your opinion on love
You can try for sure but one way or another
It'll change your opinion on love"

Well he changed his mind by the very next fall
And he asked her and they reconciled
And he said he didn't want to waste time at all
So they married and they had a child
And he told her that he'd stay forever
And he loved her every chance he got
But he said a lot of things that he later on forgot
'cause he wanted her to be things that she was not

When you're tied to one and the preacher says "brother,
It'll have to be enough"
You get tired of one and one way or another
It'll change your opinion on love

Well he was scared to leave her when his love went down
But he knew that he could not stay
So he found him a job working out of town
And he's putting it off that way
So he finds a girl in Atlanta and he loves her every chance he gets
And he says a lot of things that i hope he won't forget
But he knows a lot of things that he hasn't remembered yet

When you're sitting in the shade thinking you've got it made
And you swear that you are in love
Hold off for a second 'cause anything i reckon
Will change your opinion on love
Don't be swearing on the bible 'cause anything's liable
To change your opinion on love---Lyrics submitted by Skippy.
