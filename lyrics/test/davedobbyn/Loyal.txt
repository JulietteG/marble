I can't remember last time I thanked you keeping my distance unintentionally
To close for comfort is staying close enough
If I could have more time we would brainstorm
And I love you tender but we must walk away
keeping you on my bleeding heart file
And if it were different but you know it aint
Lets get on with it love

CHORUS
You call me loyal
I'll say your loyal too
You know your loyal
I feel your loyal too
Call me loyal
I'll hold you loyal too
We are loyal
Keep it that way
Keep it that way girl

Out in the battle from foreign you
Where does alliegence lie sometimes
And all of your hopes  all of your dreams
To much to value in one moment 
And all of us anxious but why hurry love?
Historys here and now    oo hoo
And why are you waiting? Your waiting for what?
History of some love
CHORUS

Keep it that way baby
We are loyal
Havent you known me long enough girl
If i could see your heart right now
Maybe thered be a change or two---Lyrics submitted by Nita.
