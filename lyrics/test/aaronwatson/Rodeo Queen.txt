We pull into town try to find the fairground
Park his Cadillac out back, behind the loading shoots
Finally met the big show
Traveling with the rodeo
I'm one of the boys
That make sure nobody pays the fare
Life ain't easy for a joker like me
I got a smile painted on my face
It's only make believe

She's got me where she wants me
Got me blinking when they couple the gate
I, afraid someone's gonna get hurt
'Cause I'm not thinking straight

I'm in love with the rodeo queen
A clown in love with the rodeo queen

Every night the crowd goes wild
When they see her riding, shining like a diamond
She don't even know my name
I try to turn my feelings off before they load the rough stuck
Gotta get my stuff together
Take a shot and forget how much time stand still when the boat starts spinning
When the boat starts spinning
When the boat startgs spinning

And every bye, tell you ride
I might work up the nerve to tell her right
Ain't just some fool in a barrel now
There's a real heart beating underneath my
Oversize wrangler, yellow suspenders
I might look like it
But I ain't a pretender
Oh no
I gotta tell her
Gotta tell her
Gotta tell her that---
