He wanted someone who loves the land as much as he does 
Someone who knows the blessings of a good hard rain 
Somebody simple and strong that He knows he can count on 
Soft as the wind, you're bold enough to bless His name 

That's why God loves cowboys 
I believe there's a place in His heart 
'Cause when the herd needs tending 
The fences needs mending 
He knows they'll work hard 
On His great big ranch called life 
'Cause they love and take care of all it's creations 
From the horses they ride 
To those brokenhearted honky tonk angels 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
That's why God loves cowboys 

He knew they need room to breathe and freedom 
So he gave 'em Texas and those big Montana skies 
He was there when he heard those prayers coming from Cheyenne 
Right beside that young man on his last ride 

Ooh, those cold nights get lonely 
He needs more then just a good fire keeping him warm 
Ooh, there's nothing more holy 
Than a love of a woman to weather life storm 

That's why God loves cowgirls 
I believe there's a place in His heart 
'Cause when the herd needs tending 
The fences needs mending 
He knows they'll work hard 
On his great big ranch called life 
'Cause they love and take care of all it's creations 
From the horses they ride 
To those brokenhearted honky tonk heroes 
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
That's why God loves cowgirls 

Ooh, ooh, ooh 
That's why God loves cowboys---
