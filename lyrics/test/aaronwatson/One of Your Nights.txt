I've had one of those days
Good for nothing kinda days
I've had hard luck, bad luck, and no luck at all
Girl, I need you to be my soft place to fall

So lay your pretty head on my side of the bed
I turn it on and on
When I turn off those bedroom lights
Say you want me to stay
Kiss my worries away, far away
I've had one of those days before
Nothing kinda days
Baby, I need one of your nights

I long to hold you tight
Fine wine and candlelight
I've had red lights, bar fights
Bright lights blinding me
Girl, I need your touch to set me free

Girl, we got that kinda romance
One that will dance without even touching the ground
Remember that night on your street
I said I'll sweep you off your feet
Well, forever is forever
And I'll never gonna let you down
Never, never gonna let you down

Want your nights

I've had one of those days
Good for nothing kinda days---
