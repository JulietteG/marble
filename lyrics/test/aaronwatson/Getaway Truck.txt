They say you never know what you got until it's gone  
He's gonna learn the hard way  
When he finds you long gone  
Come like the wind in your hair  
Hands in the air  
Singing, "so long, good luck"  

I wanna set your heart free, ride with me  
I wanna be your getaway  
Heart free, ride with me  
I wanna be your getaway truck  

1989 cheyenne Chevrolet  
5-speed single cab  
Bench seat, faded grey  
Turned over twice  
Ain't too nice  
But it knows how to run  
Girl, I get you out with a bang  
Like a bullet from a gun  

Summertime sunshine  
Cheap sunglasses  
My heart sang southern twang  
Sweeter than molasses  
Like a country angel  
Two stepping in my dance of dreams  
Girl, you got a heart of gold  
And you're beautiful in blue jeans  

They say life is like a highway  
You can turn into a dead end road  
I ain't afraid to get stuck  
I got a 4-wheel drive kinda heart  
I know is tough enough to carry any load  

I wanna be your getaway truck---
