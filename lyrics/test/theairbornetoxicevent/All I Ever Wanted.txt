I can only say these things to you when you're sleeping
I hear the hum from the wire as the sounds of the morning creeping
I lie awake and pretend you can hear me

You tell me that you're scared that you're turning into your mother
I feel myself turn into my father
We could lie to each other like they do and say we're so happy
It's easy when you're young and you still want it so badly

And I feel my heart pounding
I think I might scream

I could tell you that you're all I've ever wanted, dear, 
I can utter every word you've ever hoped to hear
I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever

Tonight you whisper like a ghost and you look so shaken
You seem quiet and small and you tell me you want to be taken
I'd just never think of you as the kind of girl who would say that
You suddenly seem like some faceless thing in my grasp

And your eyes so wide, your face aglow
It's the face of someone I don't know

I could tell you that you're all I've ever wanted, dear, 
I can utter every word you've ever hoped to hear
I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever

All I can think is that it must be a kind of rebellion
To run your fears like soldiers and slay them

I could tell you that you're all I've ever wanted, dear, 
Through the din when you're breathing when you're sleeping here
You wake and you ask me if I'm gonna be here forever, forever, forever
Your face so twisted and your eyes alight
I wanna tell you I can change the way you cry at night
But I'd be lying
Love is defying---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
