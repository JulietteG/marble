Sounds like a signal from you
Bring me to meet your sound
And I will bring you to my heart

Love like a signal you call
Touching my body my soul
Bring to me, you to meet me here

Home be the temple of your heart
Home be the body of your love
Just like holy water to my lips

Yes I do know how I survive
Yes I do know why I'm alive
To love and be with you
Day by day, by day, by day

Time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all-in his wisdom-hear
His truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land

This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be

Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh
Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh

Love like a signal you call
Touching my body my soul
Bring to me, you to meet me here
Home be the temple of your heart
Home be the body of your love
Just like holy water to my lips
Hey

Yes I do know how I survive
Yes I do know why I'm alive
To love and be with you
Day by day, by day, by day

Time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all-in his wisdom-hear
His truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land

This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be

Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh
Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh
Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh
Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh

This state of independence shall be
His truth will abound the land

Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh
Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh
Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh
Hey, hey yayah, yaya, oh---Lyrics submitted by bella.
