I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em
I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do

I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em
I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do

I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
Nobody but you
And make believe it came from you---
