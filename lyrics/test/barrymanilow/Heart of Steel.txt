I used to be such a soft touch
I gave too much
Love always came down losing Well the news is
I'm not for using
You can't break this heart of steel
You won't see me down on my knees again
You can't break this heart of steel
Lovin' you gave me a heart of steel

Knock on my door if you want to
Some night I might not want you
You taught me all the devices
Now my prices are the highest

You can't break this heart of steel
You won't see me down on my knees again
You can't break this heart of steel
Lovin' you gave me a heart of steel
You could have had me for all time
Now the pleasure I'm having is all mine
You can't break this heart of steel

You won't see me down on my knees again
You can't break this heart of steel
Lovin' you gave me a heart of steel
You can't break this heart of steel

You won't see me down on my knees again
You can't break this heart of steel
Lovin' you gave me a heart of steel
You can't break this heart of steel
You won't see me down on my knees again
You can't break this heart of steel
Lovin' you gave me a heart of steel---
