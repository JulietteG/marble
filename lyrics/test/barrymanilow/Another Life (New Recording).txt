Disconnected, Solitary
Standing all alone
Complicated, arbitrary
My feeling's still don't feel my own

Now you've changed your mind
You reach out once again
But how am I to tell you
I'm not who I was, back then

That was another life
Simply another life
And baby it's all gone
Don't you see the past is past
That some things just aren't made to last
No point in holding on
To another life

Desolated, disbelieving
I watched you walk away
You made your mind up
You didn't need me
No words could ever make you want to stay

Now I hear you tell me
My heart's as hard as steel
But I would never hurt you
Just to show you how, it feels

That was another life
Simply another life
And baby it's all gone
Don't you see the past is past
And some things just aren't made to last
No point in holding on
To another life

(Close your eyes) Close your eyes
Let it rest
Tell me you will be ok
You've got to look ahead
It's for the best 
Let me slip away

That was another life
Simply another life
And baby it's all gone
Don't you see the past is past
That some things just aren't made to last
No point in holding on
To another life

Let me slip away---Lyrics submitted by Christy.
