I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a '64 Impala

I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I could get with Leoshi
Cause she don't know me but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go, and even in my dreams
I can scheme of ways to make her mine
Cause I know she's living phat
And her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that
Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall or sit in the bleachers with girls
Who came to watch their men ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get all the fly girls and
And me I get the hood rats
I tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble
Got hit with a bottle,
and i been in the hospital
 for talkin' that mess 
I confess it's a shame when you're livin' in a city
The size of a box and nobody knows your name
glad i came to my senses
like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach 
overcometh by thought of me and her together 
Right ?
So when i asked her out she said i wasn't her type

Chorus x4

I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good
I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a '64 Impala

 I wish had a brand-new car
So far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat
But that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really whack
See I can't even get a date
So, what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With the hood rats you can hold tight
But really tho' I 'm a figaro
When I'm in my car I can't even get a hello
Well so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well then I'ma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw tell my homies look alive
Cause it's hard to survive when your livin'
In a concrete jungle and
These girls just keep passin' me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Makes me say my, my, my

I wish I was a little bit taller...
I wish I was a baller...
I wish I was a little bit taller y'all
I wish I was a baller (3)

Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause everyday would be a Friday
You could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names
Little Mookie, big Al, Lorraine
Yo you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck
Then you should notice how I feel
Cause if you don't want me around
See I go simple, I go easy, I go greyhound
Hey, you , what's that sound ?
Everybody look what's going down
Ahhhh, yes, ain't that fresh ?
Everybody wants to get down like dat
