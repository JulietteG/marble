Yawn awake, familiar surroundings, all hotel rooms are pretty much the same!
Though the room number might change, catch a glimpse of everything within the lighters flame!

Theres always a window but so changes the view, affording a clue to the answer thats owing, where we might be and where we might be going!

Theres no fixed address but the van, white as a suburb as you catch its reflection in
store windows as were headed in any direction!!

So press your head against the window, look outside at emptiness!!
Tell a joke, or take a piss, take a picture at every mile!
Lock the door and start the engine, Quince, its gonna be awhile! 

Tell a joke, take a piss, take a picture at every mile..
Start the van, close the door, Quince, I think its gonna be awhile..

The climates flay themselves, un-dress themselves, at the side of the road.
Commune at the union between failure and hope! 

Weave a highway line to stitch a skirt out on the land, twist and turn to tell a story like the palm of your hand!
Ponder, awe and wonder, keep watching the skies!
Wonder, awe and ponder, in the blink of an eye!

The climates flay themselves, un-dress themselves, at the side of the road!
Commune at the union between failure and hope! 

Turn our weakness into.. turn our blindness into..turn our questions into answers as obvious!!
Turn our weakness into might, turn our blindness into sight...
Turn our questions into answers just as obvious, as moonlight in the darkest, darkest night...as moonlight in the darkest, darkest night..---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
