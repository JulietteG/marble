Psychotherapist once claimed I had acute neurosis,
Well, I only said a couple words and he made his diagnosis.
He said I could say whatever I want cause I never chose this.
So i spat, grinned, then i looked at him and i blew him a glassgow kiss behind!!

Knows just when I let a bottom be dead!!
Never too sure, if it's the truth or a lie!

I'm not asking for your pity, woe is me sarcastically!
I'm not losing sleep pathetically while waxing so poetically!!

But I'm waning, waiting alphabetically..
As I keep dropping bombs, dropping bombs, dropping bombs apologetically..

It was a wicked, whimpering winnipeg night,
when my tongue grew wings and took to flight! 
The thought had never crossed my mind before that moment,
is the truth so bent, it can't be broken?!

My jealousy got the best of me and had a conference with the rest of me,
and said "if this is all that's left for me then there's so little room for regret."
And that little voice "hey", little voice "hey", little voice inside my head said "if you don't regret nothing, then you might as well be dead!!"

Might as well be dead!


So I apologize, mostly to that four or five guys who stand behind me on the stage every night..
as the mic starts to whisper and the words starts to blister in my mouth, that I know arent right..
I've gotta get back to who I was before, my last ten years on autopilot!

Its the mask that quite often starts to eat into your face,
So wear it lightly like a hat, that can quickly be replaced.
I've gotta get back to who I was before, my last ten years on autopilot!

So tell me again, how my life should have been,
Before I was spineless, before I gave in!!
Because everybody thinks its timeless, well times running out,
One thing Ill never regret, is I never shut my face!!!---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
