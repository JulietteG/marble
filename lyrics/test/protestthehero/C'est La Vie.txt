Stepped off a chair, so he could learn to let loose, 
Learn to let loose before the pendulum wore off.
His final sound a gurgle and a cough 
And his final words, "The pendulum wore off" 

Stepped off a building to find some concrete evidence,
Concrete evidence that he'd ever make an impact..
Fiction splattered into, fiction splattered into fact...FACT!!

And his fiction splattered into another sidewalk painting on display.
Stepped off a bridge so he could make a splash,
To make a splash he had to flounder like a fish out of water...
Another lamb that chose the slaughter!

Stepped off a chair so he could learn to let loose
Learn to let loose before the pendulum wore off
His final sound...

Stepped off a platform and he briefly made the news, yeah he briefly made the news..
Made the news...and he made the trains run fifteen minutes late..

Oh what a price to pay, the trains run fifteen minutes late.
Oh what a price to pay,  to be the author of your fate..
The trains were fifteen minutes late, to be the author of your fate..
The trains were fifteen minutes late, to be the author of your fate!!

C'est la vie, a drooling old bitch and a house full of lies
C'est la vie, the little things that kill you make you glad to be alive
C'est la vie, disease in your genes and ocean levels on the rise
C'est la vie, sing a song of living before everybody dies!!!---Lyrics submitted by Amelia.
