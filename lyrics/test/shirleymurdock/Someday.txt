Daughters  their Mothers, Sons against their Fathers
How did our families get this way?
We wonder why the world crashing down so fast.
It seems as though we cant get Love to last.
Someday, well unite as one.

People filled with hatred, Brothers against brothers
When will we love as Christ love us?
When will we stop all this foolish fighting?
Then we can stop so much this senseless dying.
Someday, well unite as one.

Someday, we will all be together.
Well walk hand in hand, Someday
It will all be someday it will be better yall.
We love one another, Someday.

Men abusing their ladies, Mother killing their babies
When will we learn why Jesus came?
He came to earth to give us life abundantly
And He gave His life so we can live eternally
Someday, well unite as one.

When will we learn to love one another?
When will we realize that we can?
When will we realize we need another?
When will we walk hand in hand?
Together, we can stand!

Someday!
Someday, it will be over
Someday!
Someday, the storm will rise no more
Someday!
It will all be done!

Someday!
Someday, it will be over.
Someday!
The storm will rise no more
Someday!
Someday, well walk hand in hand
And well all love one another, Someday.

Someday, it will all be better and we will love one another, Someday.
Someday, it will all get better and well love one another, Someday!---Lyrics submitted by Merian Terry.
