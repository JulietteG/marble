Wrathful one, nine eyes gaze
Holding skulls
Filled and laced
With human blood

Wrathful one, nine eyes gaze
Holding skulls
Filled and laced
With human blood

Shades of darkened skies
Emptiness
Twilight holding through
Offering

Lie in zenith
Bulls' bloodshot eye
Flattened portrait of night sky

Feel crust hum
Facing the north
Vapor space

Between heaven and earth
Wisdom and the knower
A planet collide
Divisible we fall

Hear dirt waves
Wading forth
Vapor space

How long has it been
Since we flew through shadows?
I have walked on many other planets

How long has it been
Since we flew through shadows?
I have walked on many other planets

Sinister twin
Choking on fear
Bonded iron
Sink to the core

Hear dirt waves
Wading forth
Vapor space

Shades of darkened skies
Emptiness
Twilight holding through
Offering

Wrathful one, nine eyes gaze
Holding skulls
Filled and laced
With human blood---Lyrics submitted by amit geva.
