I'd guess they would say we could set this world ablaze

Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

It is hard to see
Through all the haze at the top of the trees
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around

Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

Faltering footsteps, dead end path
All that I need is this wise man's staff
Encased in crystal he leads the way
I guess they'd say we could set this world ablaze

Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

I guess they would say we can set the world ablaze
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around

Take my black soul
Arrive in the fires that burn my skin
And guide my eyes all through this maze
I guess they'd say we could set this world ablaze

All that I have seen standing on the edge
The foot of precipice floating in the sea
Past the king of swords quickly to the shore
The last baron, the last baron

Ghost of man surround me in my slumber
I have no fear as your wing is my shelter

Cyanide he craves, coursing through his veins
Providing him with strength to see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes, faith in mystic power
The last baron, the last baron

Will he save me? Will he save me?

I was standing staring at the world and I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world and I can't see it

I was standing staring at the world and I still can't see it
I was standing staring at the world and I still can't see it

I was standing staring at the world and I still can't see it
I was standing staring at the world and I still can't see it

All that I have seen standing on the edge
The foot of precipice floating in the sea
Past the king of swords quickly to the shore
The last baron, the last baron

Ghost of man surround me in my slumber
I have no fear as your wing is my shelter

Cyanide he craves, coursing through his veins
Providing him with strength to see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes, faith in mystic power
The last baron, the last baron

Will he save me? Will he save me?
Will he save me?

I guess they would say we can set this world ablaze
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around

It is hard to see
Through all the haze at the top of the trees
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around

Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around

Faltering footsteps, dead end path
All that I need is this wise man's staff
Encased in crystal he leads the way
I guess they'd say we could set this world ablaze---Lyrics submitted by amit geva.
