So damn sure, you wanna look kind,
24/7 on my mind,
All I ever wanted is to be with you,
Making me feel so brand new.
I thought I could love no more,
one too many times before.
Everytime I look up to the sky,
I've got you on my mind

I thought I could love no more,
one too many times before,
Everytime I look up to the sky,
I've got you on my mind.

(colors of the rainbow) x4

Colors of the rainbow shine so bright,
Everytime I look into your eyes.
It's the colors of the rainbow feeding my soul,
Over and over just like you do.
(x2)---Lyrics submitted by pistol.
