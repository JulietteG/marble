I'm just a country boy stuck in an L.A. haze
Got my first week off in a hundred days
Thought I'd head to the Islands     To get a little taste
Of what the parrot is a-squakin' about

So I went surfin' through cyberspace
Found some cheap tickets to a tropical place
Rounded up my posse at the terminal gate
We hopped the first bird South

(Chorus)
We'll be the cowboys of the caribbean
Kick off your boots man we ain't gonna need 'em
Saddle up the wave runners here we come
Yippy-Kai-Yay and a bottle of rum
We're the wild bunch           We're the young guns
We're the cowboys......of the caribbean

We're gonna charter us a boat out of some new harbor
Raise our sails out on the clear blue water
Old glory flag like the....jolly roger
High upon the mast
We'll do some deep sea fishin' and maybe some scuba
Pick up a hot mama on our way to Tortuga
We might even cruise all the way to Cuba
And tell old Castro to kiss our....oh

(Chorus)

A white sand beach crawlin' with sun-tanned babes
A long, long way from my home on the range
But-a-sweet margarita....just might convince me to stay
Yayee   Yayee   Yeah

(Chorus)  then tag with
We're the wild bunch        We're the young guns
We're the cowboys......of the caribbean      aaarrrggg---Lyrics submitted by Alan Callahan.
