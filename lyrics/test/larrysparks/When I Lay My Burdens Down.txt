REFRAIN:
Glory glory, hallelujah
Since I lay my burden down
Glory glory, hallelujah
Since I lay my burden down

Ain't gonna have no pain or sorrow
When I lay my burden down
Ain't gonna have no pain or sorrow
When I lay my burden down

I'm gonna see my Lord and Savior
When I lay my burden down
I'm gonna see my Lord and Savior
When I lay my burden down

All my sickness will be over
When I lay my burden down
All my sickness will be over
When I lay my burden down

All my troubles will be over
When I lay my burden down
All my troubles will be over
When I lay my burden down

Lord, I'm feeling so much better
Since I lay my burden down
Lord, I'm feeling so much better
Since I lay my burden down

Sometimes I feel, I feel like shouting
Since I lay my burden down
Sometimes I feel, I feel like shouting
Since I lay my burden down.

I decided to follow Jesus
When I laid my burden down
Yes I decided to follow Jesus
When I laid my burden down

I am climbing so much higher
Since I laid my burden down
Yes I'm climbing so much higher
Since I laid my burden down

I will see all my loved ones
When I lay my burden down
I will see all my loved ones
When I lay my burden down

I'm gonna shout and sang forever
When I lay my burden down
I'm gonna shout and sang forever
When I lay my burden down---Lyrics submitted by Jerry Hargett.
