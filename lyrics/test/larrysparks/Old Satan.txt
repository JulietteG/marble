Living in a world of mass confusion, where contentment is hard to find;
Living in the days of revelation, with old Satan close behind.

You better look around, you better look around.
You better be wonderin what salvations all about.
You better believe and understand,
Before ol Satan takes command;
Hes gonna take you, it aint gonna be to the promised land.

Ive been talked about and laughed at; Ive been locked out in the cold.
But I dont aim to give old Satan any claim upon my soul.

You better look around, you better look around.
You better be wonderin what salvations all about.
You better believe and understand,
Before ol Satan takes command;
Hes gonna take you, it aint gonna be to the promised land.

When temptations all around you, and you feel like turning back, 
Just remember that ol Satans right there breathing down your back.

You better look around, you better look around.
You better be wonderin what salvations all about.
You better believe and understand,
Before ol Satan takes command;
Hes gonna take you, it aint gonna be to the promised land.---Lyrics submitted by Tom Roberts.
