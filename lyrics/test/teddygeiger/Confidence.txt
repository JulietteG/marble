Alright, yeah
Wondering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you 
What I feel about you

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannonball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have 
For you I will
For you I will

Forgive me if I st-stutter from all the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes, like a water bed
Do I seem familiar, I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage I want to be exposed, and not be afraid to fall 

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce I have
And cannonball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce I have
For you I will
You always want what you can't have 
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will

For you

If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a mood, yeah, I would
Shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah
That's what I'd do
That's what I'd do
To get through to you, yeah

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
Cannonball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have 
For you I will 
You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
Muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will

For you I will---Lyrics submitted by Andrea Castillo.
