Oh I lie when i drink, and I drink a lot,
Don't belive me when I've had a few. 
Oh I lie when I drink, and I drink a lot,
I only drink when i'm missin you. 

I walk in the bartender rolls his eyes.
At the same time the waitress, she just smiles.
He's heard the truth about you
She's heard it too but slightly skewed
I had lied i broke your heart in two. 

Oh I lie when i drink, and I drink a lot,
Don't belive me when I've had a few. 
Oh I lie when I drink, and I drink a lot,
I only drink when i'm missin you. 

At closin' time I'm the last one out the door.
I tip that waitress, that bartender I ignore. 
I yell "I'm never comin' back!" That always makes them laugh. 
They know me, I won't keep my word. 

Cause' I lie when i drink, and I drink a lot,
Don't belive me when I've had a few. 
Oh I lie when I drink, and I drink a lot,
I only drink when i'm missin you. 
I only drink when i'm missin you.---Lyrics submitted by river records.
