Everybody's Free To Feel Good
Everybody's Free To Feel Good
Everybody's Free
(Dance Break)

Brother and sister together 
will make it through,
Someday a spirt will lift you 
and take you there,
I know you've been hurting 
but ill be there waiting to be there for you,
And ill be there just helping you by
when ever I can,
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh

Everybody's Free To Feel Good
Everybody's Free To Feel Good

In honour our family 
That chips in together as one,
Helping each other 
Instead of just waisting time,
Now is the moment to reah out
To someone inside of you,
With everyone sharing there hope
And love they went through,
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh

Everybody's Free To Feel Good

Everybody's Free To Feel Good
Everybody's Free To Feel Good
Everybody's Free To Feel Good
Everybody's Free To Feel Good
Everybody's Free To Feel Good
