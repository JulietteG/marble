I knew that this was wrong of us
Kept reaching for the bedroom light
But she turned me on 
So I turned it off

Now every man has got his flaws
His breaking point
His sacred cause
And I have mine
But I crossed that line

Now I could never ask you to
Forgive me for the things I do
But if you ever need me
You know where Ill be

Meet me in California
Ill be there waiting for youre call
Well Ill be there waiting for you
Cause you know in California
Theres something better for us all
Meet me in California

This night was like a bible verse
With pages torn
And missing words
Condemning me
And Im on my knees

I wish that I could start again
Peel the past like sun burnt skin
Right off of me
But its not that easy

Now I could never ask you to
Forgive me for the things I do
But if you ever need me
You know where Ill be

Meet me in California
Ill be there waiting for youre call
Well Ill be there waiting for you
Cause you know in California
Theres something better for us all
Meet me in California

I dont wanna say goodbye
And I dont wanna make you cry
I just want to see you smile again
Cause everything I used to be
Is waiting over there for me
This is a beginning, not an end
Well I could never ask you to
Forgive me for the things I do
But if you ever need me 
You know where Ill be

Meet me in California
Ill be there waiting for youre call
Ill be there waiting for you
Cause you know in California
Theres something better for us all
Meet me in California
Oohhhhh
Ooohhhhh
Ill be there waiting for you

Cause you know in California
Theres something better for us all
Meet me in California---Lyrics submitted by Ashlyn.
