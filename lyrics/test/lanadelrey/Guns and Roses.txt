Mm, heavy metal love of mine
I should've learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time
But you were worth it anyway

'Cause you were so much better
Than the rest of them
Out of all the others
You were the honest man

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
Roses, roses

Motorcycle love, divine
I should've learned to let you play
I wasn't the marryin' kind
I should've done it anyway

You should've left those fakers
And then began again
To kill thy king, Detroit
Back to the promised land

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
Roses, roses

I can feel coming in the air tonight
See you workin' on that blue Pacific
I can see you bathing in the summer light
Turnin' tan, I'm in love too

I think you got game, boy, game, boy
You got game, boy, game, boy
You got game, boy, game, boy
You got game

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
Roses, roses

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
Roses, (roses), roses, (roses)

Roses, roses, roses---
