Darlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming honestly
How charming she can be
Fooling everyone
Telling them she's having fun

She says, "You don't want to be like me, don't want to see
All the things I've seen"
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'
She says, "You don't want to get this way, famous and dumb
At an early age"

Lyin', I'm lyin'
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Buy her tonight 
She's still shinin'
Like lightning,
Oh, like lightning

Carmen, Carmen
Staying up till morning
Only 17, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming truly
How disarming you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream
Coney Island queen

She says, "You don't want to be like me, lookin' for fun,
Gettin' high for free"
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'
She says, "You don't want to get this way, street walk at
Night and a star by day"
It's tirin', tirin'

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Buy her Tonight
She's still shinin'
Like lightning
Oh, like lightning

Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

[Background]

(Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi,  de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi, et je mourrais 
Sans toi, je tuerais pour toi)

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Buy her tonight
She's still shinin'
Like lightning
Oh, like lightning.

Like lightning
Oh, like  lightning

Darlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf---Lyrics submitted by D Patterson.
