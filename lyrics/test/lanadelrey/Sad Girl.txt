Me and my mistress on the side
It might not appear to fools like you
We been around on the side
Wanna be somethin' you would do

But you haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen him

He's got the fire and he walks with me
He's got the fire and he talks with me

His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl

Bein' a bad bitch on the side
Might not appear to fools like you
We been around while he gets high
It might not be somethin' you would do

But you haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen him

He's got the fire and he walks with me
He's got the fire and he talks with me

His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl

Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talkin' to
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talkin' to

I'm on fire, baby, I'm on fire

He's got the fire and he walks with me
He's got the fire and he talks with me

His bonnie on the side, bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl, I'm a mad girl, I'm a bad girl---
