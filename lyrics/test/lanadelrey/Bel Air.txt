Gargoyles, standing, at the front of your gate.
Trying to tell me to wait,
But I cant wait to see you.

So I run, like I'm mad, to heaven's door.
I don't wanna be bad,
I won't cheat you no more.

Roses, Bel Air, take me there,
I have been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees, in the light, i can see, late at night
Darling I'm waiting to greet you,
Come to me baby.

Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flare
For the violent-est kind of love anywhere out there

Now I'm lost, sweet child of mine,
You're divine.
Didn't anyone ever tell you,
It's okay to shine?

Roses, Bel Air, take me there,
I have been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light,
I can see, late at night.
Darling I'm waiting to greet you,
Come to me baby.

Don't be afraid of me,
Don't be ashamed.
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection.
Idol of roses, iconic soul.
I know your name.
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction.

Roses Bel Air, take me there,
I have been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light,
I can see, late at night.
Darling I'm waiting to greet you,
Come to me baby.

Roses Bel Air, take me there,
I have been waiting to meet you.
Grenadine, sunshine, can you break this heart of mine?
Darling I'm waiting to greet you,
Come to me baby.---Lyrics submitted by Florencia Riani.
