(Aundrea)
Ooo yea yea here we go
I know we got everybody waiting
To see just how we do 
I'm telling u we going hard
Mix it up with some old school and a little new

(Aubrey)
We'll make u jump right outta your seat
Make u loose your mind when u feel that beat
It's just because 
We ain't goin no where going no where oh

(Day26 +Danity Kane)
OOO this ain't nothing like u heard before
We gonna have u want it more
Like it is when u wit your girl and ladies wit your man
This is our chance to make you move
OO we'll be right there right there

(Que)
I know feel that(beat)
And it's making you wanna stop

(Mike)
U might as well loose urself let it go
Cuz we just gonna keep giving u what u want

(Robert)
See this is not a game
Turn the music up and let it play
And we ain't going no where going no where

(ALL 2x)
OOO this ain't nothing like u heard before
We gonna have u want it more
Like it is when you with your girl and  ladies with your man
This is our chance to make u move
We'll be right there right there

(All)
Hold up we bout to make this official
Put ur drinks in the air and take it straight to the dance floor
Loose urself and let the music control who u are
You owe urself to let go
We got everything u need and what u looking for
You don't have to look no more

(All)
OOO this ain't nothing like u heard before
We gonna have u want it more
Like it is when u wit your girl and ladies wit your man
This is our chance to make u move
We'll be right there(right there) right there(right there)---Lyrics submitted by Briana.
