Well I can still smell the Portland air
And it makes me sick to my stomach
To think of what you've become
These tall evergreens
And the lights of your city
Should have warned me long ago
That I fell way too fast

If mountains could talk
This one would share its secrets with me
Of what it has seen
Of you and the way you move
So now that I'm listening
I've got my ear to the wall and my feet are touching the ground
I'm trying not to give myself away
But my heart is beating way too loud
And that got my thinking
One may never be as happy as one seems
So I'll go ahead and give myself away
Cause this dream is taking all of me

You won't talk
And it remained
Just you and I overlooking these Portland lights
From the top of a mountain
In a park where you call home
From the top of a mountain
In a park where you call home

If mountains could talk
This one would share its secrets with me
Of what it has seen
Of you and the way you move
So now that I'm listening
I've got my ear to the wall and my feet are touching the ground
I'm trying not to give myself away
But my heart is beating way too loud
And that got my thinking
One may never be as happy as one seems
So I'll go ahead and give myself away
Cause this dream is taking all of me

Things got a little crazy for me for that week
Where I drank myself stupid to the point where I couldn't even speak
It's beautiful here, I don't ever want to leave
Then I thought about the unfortunate side effect
Of me being me

And I remembered
Back where this leads
Back to the park where you call home
And me realizing
What back then
I should have known
I'd hate what you'd become

Well I can still smell that Portland air

So now that I'm listening
I've got my ear to the wall and my feet are touching the ground
I'm trying not to give myself away
But my heart is beating way too loud
And that got my thinking
One may never be as happy as one seems
So I'll go ahead and give myself away
Cause this dream is taking all of me---Lyrics submitted by case.
