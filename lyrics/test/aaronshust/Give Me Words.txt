Calloused and bruised
Dazed and confused
My Spirit is left wanting something more
My selfish hopes and my selfish dreams
I'm lying with my face down on the floor
Cryin out for more

Cryin out for more

So give me words to speak
Don't let my spirit sleep
Cuz I can't think of anything worth saying
But I know that I owe you my life

Give me words to speak
don't let my spirit sleep

Every night, every day
I find that I have nothing I can say
So I stand here in silence
Awaiting Your guidance
I'm wanting only Your voice to be heard
Let'm be Your Words

Let'm be Your Words

Give me words to speak
don't let my spirit sleep
Cuz I can't think of anything worth saying
But I know that I owe you my life
So Give me words to speak
don't let my spirit sleep

I just don't understand this life that I've been living
I just don't understand, I just don't understand
I just don't understand, These lies I've been believing
I just don't understand, I just don't understand

So give me words to speak
Don't let my spirit sleep
Cuz I can't think of anything worth saying
But I know that I owe you my life
So Give me words to speak
don't let my spirit sleep

Give me words to speak
Don't let my spirit sleep
Cuz I can't think of anything worth saying
But I know that I owe you my life
So Give me words to speak
Don't let my spirit sleep
I know, I know I owe You my life
All my life, All my life
I know I know I owe You my life
All my life, All my life---Lyrics submitted by cheryl.
