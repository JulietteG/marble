I meet with You and my soul sings out
As Your word throws doubt far away
I sing to You and my heart cries Holy!
Hallelujah, Father, You're near!

(Chorus)
My hope is in You, Lord
All the day long
I won't be shaken by drought or storm
A peace that passes understanding is my song
And I sing
My hope is in You, Lord

I wait for You and my soul finds rest
In my selfishness, You show me grace
I worship You and my heart cries Glory
Hallelujah, Father You're here!

Chorus

I will wait on You
You are my refuge
I will wait on You
You are my refuge

I will wait on You
You are my refuge
I will wait on You
You are my refuge


My hope is in You, Lord
All the day long
I won't be shaken by drought or storm
My hope is in You, Lord
All the day long
I won't be shaken by drought or storm
A peace that passes understanding is my song
And I sing
My hope is in You, Lord (X3)---Lyrics submitted by Mary Thevatheri.
