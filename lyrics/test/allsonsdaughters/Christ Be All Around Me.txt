As I rise, strength of God
Go before, lift me up
As I wake, eyes of God
Look upon, be my sight

As I wait, heart of God
Satisfy and sustain
As I hear, voice of God
Lead me on, be my guide

Above and below me
Before and behind me
In every eye that sees me
Christ be all around me

And as I go, Hand of God
My defense, by my side
And as I rest, breath of God
Fall upon, bring me peace

Above and below me
Before and behind me
In every eye that sees me
Christ be all around me

Your life, Your death
Your blood was shed
For every moment
Every moment

Above and below me
Before and behind me
In every eye that sees me
Christ be all around me---
