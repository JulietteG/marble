It's time to go again 
To your blue room 
Got some questions to ask of you 
In your blue room 
The air is clean 
Your skin is clear 
I've had enough of hangin' round here 
It's a different kind of conversation 
Your blue room 

Saw me calling love, somewhere deep inside 
Saw me calling you, somewhere I can hide 

And time is a string of pearls 
Your blue room 
See the future just hanging there 
Your blue room 
And you crave 
A new perspective 
Looking down on my objectives 
New instructions 
Whatever their directions
Your blue room 

Saw me calling love 
(Bongolese) 
Saw me calling 
(Bongolese) 

It's alright 
Your blue room 
One day I'll be back 
Your blue room 
Yeah, I hope I remember where it's at 
Your blue room 

See me slide 
Won't you take me back there 
So much fun to me 

[Adam]
Zooming in 
Zooming out 
Nothing I can do about 
A lens to see it all up close 
Magnifying what everybody knows 
Never in conflict 
Never alone 
No car alarm 
No cellular phone---Lyrics submitted by jorge aguilar g.
