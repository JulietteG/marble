Nature, nurture, heaven and, home
Sum of all, and by them, driven
To conquer every mountain shown
But I've never crossed the river

Braved the forests, braved the stone
Braved the icy winds and fire
Braved and beat them on my own
Yet I'm helpless by the river

Angel, angel what have I done
I've faced the quacks, the wind, the fire
I've conquered country, crown and, throne
Why can't I cross this river? 2x

Pay no mind to the battles you've won
It'll take a lot more then rage and muscle
Open your heart and hands my son
Or you'll never make it over the river

It'll take a lot more then words and guns
A whole lot more the riches and muscle
The hands of the many must join as one
And together we'll cross the river 2x

(Nature, nurture, heaven and, home)
I'll take a lot more then words and guns
(Sum of all, and by them, driven)
A whole lot more then riches and muscle
(To conquer every mountain shown)
The hands of the many must join as one
And together we'll cross the river

(Braved the forest, braved the stone)
It'll take a lot more then words and guns
(Braved the icy winds and fire)
A whole lot more then riches and muscle
(Braved and beat them on my own)
The hands of the many must join as one
And together we'll cross the river

And together we'll cross the river

And together we'll cross the river
Nature, nurture, heaven and, home
And together we'll cross the river
(And together we'll cross the river)
Nature, nurture, heaven and, home
And together we'll cross the river
(And together we'll cross the river)---Lyrics submitted by Kenna Hale.
