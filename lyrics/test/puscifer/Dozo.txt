Creep around the back door, sneak a little, peek a little, thumb on the bum middle finger on the Ringu rubbleneck around watch me watch you, gotta tap-tippy-tap on the money button 'til you hum...

Front leaning rest big poppa 'bout facial.
Show you the difference 'tween my gun 'n my pistol.
Tuggin' on the dinner bell rope, ding-a-ling-dong.
Big moon smile after while.
It's a sing along...

JESUS!
JESUS!

Dinner bell, ring-a-ling-dong.
Come and get it.
Better eat it up quick, 'cause the bitch is gonna get it.

Front leaning rest big poppa 'bout facial.
Show you the difference 'tween my gun 'n my pistol.

Front leaning rest big poppa 'bout facial.
Show you the difference 'tween my gun 'n my pistol.

Show you the difference 'tween my gun 'n my pistol.
Show you the difference 'tween my gun 'n my pistol.
Show you the difference 'tween my gun 'n my pistol.
Show you the difference 'tween my gun 'n my pistol.

DoZo.
DoZo.
DoZo.
