E.M.P. from the mother and son
toward the digital down
dawned at the age of the innocent ones

the indigo children
the indigo children come
the indigo children
the indigo children come
the indigo children
the indigo children come
the indigo children
the indigo children come
the indigo children
the indigo children
when the indigo children come
the indigo children
when the indigo children come
the indigo children
when the indigo children come
the indigo children
when the indigo children come
the indigo children
when the indigo children come


E.M.P. from the mother and son
toward the digital down
dawned at the age of the innocent ones

the indigo children

analog type piece sky wide
sync to the ticker inside
move to the rhythm of the moon and tide

the indigo children
the indigo children
the indigo children
the indigo children

serious Venus and the lunar child
(get your life up untied)
giggle and the flames grow higher
dance in a circle around a central fire
(dance and laugh and love and learn. Grow higher)

the indigo children

wine, song, food and fire
clothe, shelter and seed

no more need for the old empire (there they were to the empire) the indigo children

serious Venus and the lunar child
giggle and the flames grow higher
dance in a circle around a central fire

the indigo children

wine, song, food and fire
clothe, shelter and seed

no more need for the old empire(fare thee well to the empire) the indigo children

the indigo children come
the indigo children
when the indigo children come
the indigo children
when the indigo children come
the indigo children
when the indigo children come
the indigo children 
when the indigo children come
the indigo children
when the indigo children come
the indigo children
when the indigo children come
the indigo children
the indigo children

serious Venus and the lunar child
giggle and the flames grow higher
dance in a circle around a central fire

when the indigo children come 

wine, song, food and fire
clothe, shelter and seed

no more need for the old empire
when the indigo children come

the indigo children come (X13)
the indigo children (X13)---Lyrics submitted by Jay.
