Well, I followed her to the station.
With a suitcase in my hand.
Yeah, I followed her to the station.
With a suitcase in my hand.

Well, it's hard to tell
It's hard to tell.
When all your love's in vain.

When the train left the station,
It had two lights on behind.
When the train left the station,
It had two lights on behind.

The green light was my baby.
And the red light was my mind.

Well, it's hard to tell
It's hard to tell.
When all your love's in vain.---Lyrics submitted by Damon Sprock.
