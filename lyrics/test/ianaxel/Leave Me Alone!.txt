Its not easy
When you say that youre sorry
Its not easy
When you say you dont love me at all

Lets be honest
You dont care that you hurt me
Lets be honest
I dont care that youre lonely

You dont love me anymore
You keep coming back for more
If you dont love me anymore
Leave me alone!

Were not dating
Who cares what your mom says
Were not dating
You can sleep in your own bed

You dont love me anymore
You keep coming back for more
If you dont love me anymore
Leave me alone!

Whatever I do
Whatever I say
It doesnt matter anyway
You want me to move
You want me to stay
You wont be happy either way
Take all your shit...
Im over it!

Its not easy

You dont love me anymore
You keep coming back for more
If you dont love me anymore
Leave me alone!!!---Lyrics submitted by DEBORAH MOSS.
