I can't
Stop thinking 'bout you
Not sure
What I feel about you
I don't know
Baby I don't know
What happened to me

Lately
Can't stop the dreaming
How come
You know exactly
What to do
When I don't know

Something had me want it
I just let it go
Isn't that ironic
How I can't say no
I can not explain
Can't put my finger on it

Something had me want it
I just let it go
Isn't that ironic
How I can't say no
I can not explain
Can't put my finger on it

The touch
A constant craving
For more
Of something only
You know
And I still don't know
What happened to me

Tonight
When magic happens
Alive
Counting the seconds
Till you're here
Want you oh so near

Something had me want it
I just let it go
Isn't that ironic
How I can't say no
I can not explain
Can't put my finger on it

Something had me want it
I just let it go
Isn't that ironic
How I can't say no
I can not explain
Can't put my finger on it

Something had me want it
I just let it go
Isn't that ironic
How I can't say no
Can't put my finger on it

Something had me want it
Isn't that ironic
I can not explain
Can't put my finger on it

Something had me want it
I just let it go
Isn't that ironic
How I can't say no
I can not explain
Can't put my finger on it

Something had me want it
I just let it go
Isn't that ironic
How I can't say no
I can not explain
Can't put my finger on it
Can't put my finger on it
Can't put my finger on it---Lyrics submitted by Samuel Menacher.
