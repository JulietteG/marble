Don't you reach for the wave if you can't ride it, ride it
Don't be jumping off my grid, if you can't drive it, drive it
If you wanna play my trick, the trigger light it, light it
Say you want a bad bitch, then I buy it

All alone, let it go
Something's better not said
How you came to me like a rolling thunder
Take you there

I wanna feel my eyes rolled to the back of my head
And my heart beat pump pump pump
I wanna feel your love take me over the head
Got my body screaming one more round round round

All alone, let it go
All alone, let it go
And it feels like

Ride my engine hot hot in the traffic, traffic
You don't need that green light to get me at it, at it
If you wanna crop my body, make me criminal
If you want a bad bitch, drop me wonderful

All alone, let it go
Something's better not said
How you came to me like a rolling thunder
Take you there
I wanna feel my eyes rolled to the back of my head
And my heart beat pump pump pump
I wanna feel your love take me over the head
Got my body screaming one more round round round
I wanna feel my eyes rolled to the back of my head
And my heart beat pump pump pump
I wanna feel your love take me over the head
Got my body screaming one more round round round

All alone let it go
All alone let it go
And it feels like

And it feels like
And it feels like
And it feels like---
