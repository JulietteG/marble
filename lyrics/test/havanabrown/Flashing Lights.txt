Intro
In the flashing lights
Looking for some love tonight
You know I love the way you lie
I wanna do it and do it and do it again

[Havana]
When we talk we fine
But when we touch baby
Cause you and I are crazy
Lets do it and do it ( do it and do it )
When I see your face, I forget the basics
Cause you and I....are crazy
Lets do it and do it (do it and do it )
Oohh just put oooh yeah
Uuu yeah, just put ohhh yeah

In the flashing lights
Looking for some love tonight
You know I love the way you lie
I wanna do it do it
And do it again
In the flashing lights
Looking for some love tonight
Lets promise this just one last time
We can do it do it and do it again
And do it again, and do it again
And do it again, and do it again
And do it again, and do it again

Uuuu, uuuuu, uuu, uuuu
We can do it and do it
And do it again
Uuuu, uuuuu, uuu, uuuu
We can do it and do it
And do it again

They call me freak yeah
You call my phone save
Stay up all night baby
Lets do it do it
Just till the dawn
But we can start misbehaving
Stay up all night baby
Lets do it do it
Ooo just put uuu yeah
Uuu yeah, just put uuu yeah

In the flashing lights
Looking for some love tonight
You know I love the way you lie
I wanna do it do it
And do it again
In the flashing lights
Looking for some love tonight
Lets promise this just one last time
We can do it do it and do it again
And do it again, and do it again
And do it again, and do it again
And do it again, and do it again

Uuuu, uuuuu, uuu, uuuu
We can do it do it
And do it again
Uuuu, uuuuu, uuu, uuuu
We can do it do it
And do it again

I can make you high high
Love me, hate me, spend you dollar
Push it get this party started
In the flashing lights
Uuuu, uuuuu, uuu, uuuu
We can do it do it
And do it again
Uuuu, uuuuu, uuu, uuuu
We can do it do it
And do it again
Do it again
Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
