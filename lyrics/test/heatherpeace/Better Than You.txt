Todays the day Im leaving
I want nothing, you can have it all
Im leaving with the last bit of my sanity
You took the rest

Like a drip drip tap you fed me
Nothing but insults and lies
I want to leave with the remainder of my sanity
So bye bye

Ill find better than you
Oh no
Ill find better than you
Even though Im broken down
Oh I want nothing from you
You can have it all
Ill find better than you
Oh ohhhhh

The way you broke me down was clever
Almost unnoticeable
To all our friends it looked like I was crazy
And totally irrational

Like a drip drip tap you fed me
Feeding on my insecurities
I want to go with the remainder of my sanity
Now its time to leave

Ill find better than you
Oh no
Ill find better than you
Even though Im broken down
Oh I want nothing from you
You can have it all
Ill find better than you
Oh ohhhhh

Was it always your intention to leave me like this
Was it always your intention to hurt me this way
Was it always your intention to break me
God I never thought Id be so breakable
Oh no no no

Ill find better than you
Oh no
Ill find better than you
Even though Im broken down
Oh I want nothing from you
You can have it all
Ill find better than you
Oh ohhhhh---
