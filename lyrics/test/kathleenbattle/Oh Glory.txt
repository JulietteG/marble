Oh glory, 
Oooh glory 
There is room enough in paradise 
To have a home in 
Glory 
Jesus my own to Heaven's gone 
To have home in glory 
He who I'm fixed my hopes upon 
To have a home in glory 
Glory-yyy uuuuh 
Glory 
There is room enough in paradise 
To have a home in glory 
His light I see 
And I pass to to have a home in glory 
Uuuuu, glory-yyy 
Glory-yyy there is room enough in paradise 
To have a home 
To have a home 
To have a home 
In glory-yyy---Lyrics submitted by Mac Onie.
