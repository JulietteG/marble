There's another way
There must be another way
This is not a game 
We'll play it anyway

I stare into my screen
It gives me what I need
Jumping at the bed 
To get my drip feed 

I love your strangle hold
I need your strangle hold
Just squeeze until I go, go

Help me, help me
You know me better than I know myself
Mayday, mayday
Save me cause I'm a danger to myself
You know me better than I know myself

I'm getting nothing done, I'm getting nothing done
Failing all my friends
I'm failing everyone

I love your strangle hold
I need your strangle hold
Just squeeze until I go, go

Help me, help me
You know me better than I know myself
Mayday, mayday
Save me cause I'm a danger to myself

Help me, help me
You know me better than I know myself
Save me cause I'm a danger to myself

How long, How long was I sleeping ( x4)

Help me, help me 
You know me better than I know myself
Mayday, mayday
Save me cause I'm a danger to myself

Help me, help me
You know me better than I know myself
Save me cause I'm a danger to myself---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
