Went to college, studied art
to be an artist. make a start
studied hard, gained my degree
but no one seemed to notice me

Painter Man, Painter Man
Who would be a Painter Man
Painter Man, Painter Man
Who would be a Painter Man

Tried cartoons and comic books
dirty postcards, woman's books
here was where the money lay
classic art has had its day

Painter Man, Painter Man
Who would be a Painter Man
Painter Man, Painter Man
Who would be a Painter Man

Do adverts for TV
household soap and brands of tea
labels all around the cans
who would be a Painter Man

Painter Man, Painter Man
Who would be a Painter Man
Painter Man, Painter Man
Who would be a Painter Man

La la la, la la la
La la la la la la
Painter Man, Painter Man
Who would be a Painter Man---Lyrics submitted by Andrew Hetherington.
