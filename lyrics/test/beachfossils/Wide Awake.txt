So wide, awake,
Within your whole wide world,
I'll risk all our time,
This worlds with all your thoughts,
Warm rays of the sun,
We're leaving it all,
But you're still taking some.

Forgot the way,
I don't know which way we came,
I lost all of my days,
They're fading all into the same.---Lyrics submitted by Petar Gjalevski.
