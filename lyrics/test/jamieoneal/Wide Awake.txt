My baby loves to hold me in his arms and gently touch my face
As we lie there close together late at night
In our own special place
Its like I'm driftin' off to heaven when he does that thing that only he can do
He moves his lips in little ways that let me know he's in heaven too

He's sorin again and I'm wide awake
Its like a nascar race bein run on his face
And the bed starts to tremble and shake
I try to roll him over I kick him with my feet
Hell I gotta wake him up so I can get sleep
For a moment he's quiet and then
He's snorin' again

In the morning he wakes up so happy
Lookin' all refreshed
While I count the lines and the dark circles
Cause I aint had no rest
Ohh the day seems to drag along and I cant wait to get myself in bed
But soon that old familiar sound
Comes crashin' in my head

He's snorin' again and I'm wide awake
Its like an old buzz saw tearin' up the walls
And I've had more than I can take
I'm glad to hear he's breathin'
I know he needs his rest but that snortin'and that wheezin 
Sure puts me to the test
Gonna make him go sleep in the den
He's snorin' again

He sleeps just like a baby but he sounds just like a tank
He knows that I adore him but when he gets to snorin'
I have to grab his hair and yank---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Aristo.
