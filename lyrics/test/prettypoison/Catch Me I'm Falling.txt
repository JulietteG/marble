Are you ready boy?
Here I come, 
Catch Me I'm Falling

You... 
Came into my life
The look in your eyes
Took me by suprise
It's you... and nobody else
The love that made me so blind I can't see
I am descending... 
From heaven above... so catch me I'm falling baby
Hold on to my love

Chorus
Catch me I'm Falling
Catch me now I'm Falling
Catch me I'm Falling
Catch me now I'm Falling
Falling in love
Two hearts, beating in time
With or as one I'm yours, your mine
For you, I surrender myself
Each night, everyday always felling this way
Falling in motion... 
As though I had wings... 
With your sweet love and devotion
Baby it's Magic! 
A magical thing

Chorus
Catch me I'm Falling
Catch me now I'm Falling (Oh ow oh ow oh)
Catch me I'm Falling
Catch me now I'm Falling
Falling in love

Oooooo Catch Me

I am descending... 
From heaven above... so catch me I'm falling
Hold on to my love

Chorus
Catch me I'm Falling
Catch me now I'm Falling
Catch me I'm Falling
Catch me now I'm Falling

Ooo catch me I'm Falling
Catch me now I'm Falling
Catch me I'm Falling
Catch me now I'm Falling
Falling love

Ooooo I'm falling (repeat and fade)---Lyrics submitted by Steve Perrii.
