Why why you leave me alone baby 
Im still still loving you 
Youre leaving me right now 
but I hope youll be happy  

You always had a habit of telling me 
our looming farewell (the last) 
I always had a habit of telling you 
Ill do anything to 
protect you 

(I wanna) Hold you tight 
Make you mine 
Never leave me alone 
I only want you, 
thats all I need 
Eventually everything fell apart 
Why are you leaving me like this 

Good luck baby 
Good luck to you 
You better be happy 
if youre leaving me, 
the one who only knew 
and looked at you. 
Good luck baby 
Good luck to you 
No matter who you meet 
you better be as happy as 
the amount of pain youve left me with. 

I hate you love you 
Several times a day Up and down 
Feels like an elevator 
Heal me Im heartsick 
There aint no cure for my disease 
Im worn, because of you 
I cant uphold the immense pain youve left me with 
In this situation I find myself putting my hands 
together for you. I pray for ya, Good luck to ya 

(I wanna) Hold you tight 
Make you mine 
Never leave me alone 
I only want you, 
thats all I need 
Eventually everything fell apart 
Why are you leaving me like this 

Good luck baby 
Good luck to you 
You better be happy 
if youre leaving me, 
the one who only knew 
and looked at you. 
Good luck baby 
Good luck to you 
No matter who you meet 
you better be as happy as 
the amount of pain youve left me with. 

You have to be happier, 
just remember this 
no one will love you more than I did 
I might be just one of your many farewells 
but you will be my first and last. 

Good luck baby 
Good luck to you 
You better be happy 
if youre leaving me, 
the one who only knew 
and looked at you. 
Good luck baby 
Good luck to you 
No matter who you meet 
you better be as happy as 
the amount of pain youve left me with.---
