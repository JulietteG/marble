Those triple measures keep the demons at bay
My face keeps twitching but I'm feeling okay
Ain't got much time and there's so little to say
Just leave those lemons out of my Tanqueray.

I sang this melody I wrote just for you
I played your rhapsody, now I'm feeling blue
Ain't made to suffer now, you know that I can't
Too busy thinking 'bout Oscar Levant
Can't help but think about Oscar Levant
I think I'm Oscar Levant.

I did some reckoning, yeah, I was the man
Effectuating anything that I can
There was no limit to my own petulance
Up to my eyeballs in this chain of events.

I used to try to focus every day
Just cogitating on the words you might say
Walking 'round the house in my underpants
I'm masquerading as Oscar Levant
Can't help but think about Oscar Levant
I think I'm Oscar Levant.

Those triple tuies keep the demons at bay
My head is throbbing but I'm doing okay
Why let mere circumstances get in the way?
I won't recall one single thing of this day.

Ain't got no remedy, you know that it's true
I sang this elegy I wrote just for you
Don't love my enemies, you know that I can't
Too busy thinking 'bout Oscar Levant,
I'm masquerading as Oscar Levant,
I'm playing badminton with Oscar Levant,
Drinking orange juice with Oscar Levant,
Gonna name our baby Oscar Levant,
Pentobarbitol and Oscar Levant,
I want to live my life like Oscar Levant, 
I think I'm Oscar Levant!---Lyrics submitted by Head of Manby.
