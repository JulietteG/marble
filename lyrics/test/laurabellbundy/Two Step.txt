I'm gonna wear what I want to cause I want to
I don't need no man
I'm gonna drink what I want to cause I want to
Just because I can
I'm gonna spend my money cause it's mine
Down on SoCo and lime
Cause it's girls night out

I'm gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step, step tonight
I'm doing my two step, what you waiting two step
Put you two steps behind
Hard to get but you want me round that donkey,
Straight to the back of the line
Gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step

Are you gonna sit there and think or buy me a drink, boy?
What's your plan?
All my girls with me, you like what you see
Oh baby this is your last chance
You've been watching since the moment we walked in
So while your boys are busy be talkin'

I'm gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step, step tonight
I'm doing my two step, what you waiting two step
Put you two steps behind
Hard to get but you want me round that donkey,
Straight to the back of the line
Gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step

Now slide, slide, two steps
Slide, slide, two steps
Work it out, work it out
Grind, grind, grind, switch
Slide, slide, two steps
Slide, slide, two steps
Work it out, work it out
Grind, grind, grind, switch

I'm gonna rock my cowboy hat
We're gonna stomp and kick until they make us all go home
You wanna save a little country girl can get down
Let me show you how

[Colt Ford]
Hey little lady, maybe you and me
Could possibly get together for a shot of Jack D
And take a little spinner by the dance floor
Tell me do you want more
All you gotta do is just say so
I can light dance, baby, I can buck dance
Take you down a dirt road, back of the truck bends
Cause Laura Bell you hell on the heart
Good Lord you're gonna tear this country boy apart

I'm gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step, step tonight
I'm doing my two step, what you waiting two step
Put you two steps behind
Hard to get but you want me round that donkey,
Straight to the back of the line
Gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step

I'm gonna do my two step, do my, do my two step, step tonight
I'm doing my two step, what you waiting two step
Put you two steps behind
Hard to get but you want me round that donkey,
Straight to the back of the line
Gonna do my two step, do my, do my, do my two step---
