Sexy, sexy
Sexy, sexy
Hey, baby I feel it, can't conceal it, gotta reveal it
'Cause I'm in the mood to give it to you
Girl we gotta concentrate, right now we're gonna consummate, so let's conversate
'Cause I think it's time that we became one love..

One body, girl I wanna get it started
It's our own little private party
Forget about tomorrow right now...right now
We could have forever tonight
Right now, right now, freakin' it however you like

(chorus)
Sexify my love
Give in to my touch 
Baby tonight I'm gonna set you free
Sexify my love, let your body talk
Baby surrender all your lovin' to me

Sexify my love (sexy sexy), sexify my love, yeah

Girl, don't be shy, you lookin' so fly
Tonight I wanna try
Every position we can dream of
Boom, bang all over the house
Workin' that thing girl, makin' you shout
Take it fast, slow, gonna do it like a pro 
Slide down at your waist and get low, low

Ooh, and your body
It's our own little private party
Let's do this, let's get started
Forget about tomorrow right now...right now
We could have forever tonight
Right now...right now freakin' it however you like

Chorus

I don't care where we are 
On the hood of my car
Out in public, makin' love in the streets
All alone back at home
We can do anything you want
I'll give you heaven while we mess up the sheets


Chorus x 4---Lyrics submitted by Shannon.
