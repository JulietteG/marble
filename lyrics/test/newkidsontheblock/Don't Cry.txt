If I hold on to your lips a little bit longer
If I want to stay inside, would you think it strange
And if I really wanna let it all go
and not save anything for tomorrow
And if tomorrow never comes, at all

Kiss me like it's the last time
Love me like it's the first time
I'll kiss you like it's the last time
And I'll love you like it's the first time
I bet you can't wait til the next time
But if there isn't a next time...

Maybe just... Don't cry Don't cry

I learned that it's just not worth fighting over little things
Like when I used to wait all night just to say "I'm sorry, I love you"
Tell me what would there be left to say?
Nothing!!
What if God wants to take me away?
Oh you better...

Take me like it's the last time
Love me like it's the first time
I'll kiss you like it's the last time
And I'll love you like it's the first time
I bet you can't wait til the next time
But if there isn't a next time...

Maybe just... Don't cry Don't cry

And if I only get just one thing to do
Then you know I wanna give the world to you
So baby won't you look me in the eye and pretend
And tell me that you know you're never never ever gonna go away
Just in case...

Kiss me like it's the last time
Love me like it's the first time
I'll kiss you like it's the last time
And I'll love you like it's the first time
I bet you can't wait til the next time
But if there isn't a next time...
Oh there might not be a next time

So maybe just... Don't cry Don't cry (Don't cry)

You know you wanna love me baby
Don't fight it
Just kiss me like it's the last time---Lyrics submitted by Angelina.
