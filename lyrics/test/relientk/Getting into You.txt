verse 1:
when I made up my mind and my heart along with that to live not for myself but yet for god somebody said "do you know what you are getting yourself into?" 
verse 2:
when I finally ironed out all of my priorities and asked god to remove the doubt that made me so unsure of these things I ask myself. I ask myself "do you know what you are getting yourself  into?"
chorus:
I'm getting into you because you got to me in a way words cant discribe. I'm getting into you because I've got to be your essential to survive I'm gonna love you with my life. 
verse 3:
when you looked to me and said I kinda view you as a son for one second our eyes met and I'm at that with the question do you know what you are getting yourself into.
