Hey taxi, Send me
Straight to the
Heart of it

The nulceus of
Politics was
Somebody,
Somebody
Started it

Cuz they taxed,
Me with a scalpel
Piece by piece

Tey cut me deep
And let me dry 
until there was 
Nothing left to 
Bleed

And this is how
i choose to live

As if i'm jumping
Off a cliff

Knowing that 
You'll save me,
Knowing that
You'll save me

And after all the 
Stupid things i did

There's nothing 
Left that
You'd forgive

Because you
Already 
Forgave me

Yeah you already 
Forgave me

Keep Driving 
Leave this deciet
Miles behind me

So far i'd 
Have to wrap
My mind in,
Just remind me

I can't try this
To pick myselfe
Back up 
And then move on

Think About the
Life I'll have
When this fragile
One is gone

And this is how i 
Choose to live

As if im jumping
Off a cliff 

Knowing that
You'll save me,
Knowing that 
You'll save 

And after all the 
Stupid things i did 

There nothing 
Left that 
You'd forgive

Because you 
Already 
Forgave me

You already
Forgave me

Never forget 
There's life 
After death and taxes
And forgivness come

And all of the rest
Is what passes away

Death and decay 
Can't touch us now


Every breath that 
I inhale is followed
By exhaling

Traps the one
Who never fails
I know you'll never 
Fail me

Never forget
There's life after 
death and taxes
Forgiveness comes

And all of the rest 
Ir just passes away

NEVER FORGET
and this is how i choose to live
as if im jumping off a cliff

THERE'S LIFE AFTER DEATH 
knowing that you'll save me

AND TAXES
knowing that you'll save me

FORGIVENESS COMES
after all the stupid things i did
there's nothhing left that you'd forgive

AND ALL OF THE REST IS WHAT PASSES AWAY
because you already forgave me
you alredy forgave me

DEATH AND DECAY cAN'T TOUCH US NOW---Lyrics submitted by jocelyn.
