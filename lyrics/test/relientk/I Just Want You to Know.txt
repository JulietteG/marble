I'm a human being.
Being happy and sane.
And ohh but human beings.
We all need to quit.
Being inhumane.

Chorus:
Yeah, I don't wanna say I'm right.
I just want you to know. 
I don't wanna say I'm right
I just want you to know.

I've a reputation 
For replacing
My confidence with fear.

But I'll be untiringly embracing
The love that I have found to be sincere

Chorus: 
I don't wanna say I'm right 
I just want you to know 
I don't wanna say I'm right 
I just want you to know

To know that there was a man 
Who lived one day
With holes in his hand.
As some do say.
And I believe we'd be friends
If we talked and prayed.
So we do.
That's Why we do.

Chorus: 
I don't wanna say I'm right 
Cause I just want you to know
I don't wanna say I'm right 
I just want you to know

Yeah, I don't wanna say I'm right
Cause I just want you to know
I don't wanna say I'm right 
Cause I just want you to know
I just want you to know
I just want you to know---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
