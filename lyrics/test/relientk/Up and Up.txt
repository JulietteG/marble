Yesterday was not quite what it could have been
As were most of the days before
But I swear today with every breath I'm breathing in
I'll be trying to make it so much more

Because it seems I guess I've hung upon
The history of what's gone wrong
That the hope of a new day is sometimes hard to see
But I'm finally catching on to it
The past is just a conduit
And the light there at the end is where I'll be

Because I'm on the up and up
I'm on the up and up
I haven't given up, given up on what
I know I'm capable of
I'm on the up and up
Yeah there's nothing left to prove
I'm just trying to be a better version of me for you
A better version of me for you

Now I have all that I could ever need
The confidence of knowing there's still time
Time to make amends and try to build a better me
Time to take the right steps as this road unwinds

But I'm finally catching on to it
The past is just a conduit
And the light there at the end is where I'll be

I'm on the up and up
I'm on the up and up
I haven't given up, given up on what
I know I'm capable of
I'm on the up and up
Yeah there's nothing left to prove
I'm just trying to be a better version of me for you
A better version of me for you

Never cease to supply
Me with what I need for a good life
So when I'm down I'll hold my head up
Because you're the reason why

I'm on the up and up
I'm on the up and up
I haven't given up, given up on what
I know I'm capable of
I'm on the up and up
Yeah there's nothing left to prove
I'm just trying to be a better version of me for you
A better version of me for you

I'm just trying to be a better version of me for you---Lyrics submitted by Dennison.
