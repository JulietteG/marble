I watched the proverbial sunrise coming up over the pacific and,
You might think I'm losing my mind but I will shy away from the specifics.
Cuz I don't want you to know where I am.
Cuz then you'll see my heart in the saddest state it's ever been.
This is no place, to try and live my life.

Stop right there! That's exactly where I lost it.
See that line? Where I never shoulda crossed it.
Stop right there! where I never shoulda said that.
It's the very moment that I wish that I could take back.

I'm sorry for, the person I became.
I'm sorry that, it took so long for me to change.
I'm ready to, be sure I never become that way again.
Cuz who I am, hates who I've been.
Who I am hates who I've been.

I talked to absolutely no one.
Couldn't keep to myself enough.
And the things bottled inside had finally begun, 
To create so much pressure that I'd soon blow up.
And I heard the reverberating foot steps,
Syncing up to the beating of my heart.
And I was positive that unless I got myself together, 
I would watch me fall apart.
And I can't let that happen again.
Cuz then you'll see my heart in the saddest state it's ever been.
This is no place, to try and live my life.

Stop right there! That's exactly where I lost it.
See that line? Where I never shoulda crossed it.
Stop right there! where I never shoulda said that.
It's the very moment that I wish that I could take back.

I'm sorry for, the person I became.
I'm sorry that, it took so long for me to change.
I'm ready to, be sure I never become that way again.
Cuz who I am, hates who I've been.
Who I am hates who I've been.

Who I am hates who I've been.
And who I am will take the second chance you gave me.
Who I am hates who I've been.
Cuz who I've been, only ever made me.

So sorry for the person I became.
So sorry that, it took so long for me to change.
I'm ready to, be sure I never become that way again.
Cuz who I am, hates who I've been.

Who I am hates who I've been.---Lyrics submitted by Talk.
