ive given up,
on giving up slowly.
im blending in,
so you wont even know me.
apart from this whole world that shares my fate.

this one last bullet you mention,
was my one last shot at redemption.
because i know to live,
you must give your life away.

and ive been housin all this doubt 
and insecurity.
and ive been locked inside that house,
all the while you hold the key.
and ive been dyin to get out,
that might be the death of me.
and even know theres no way of knowing where to go i promise im goin becuase...

CHORUS:
ohhhhh i gotta get outta here.
im stuck inside this rut that i fell into by mistake, yeah.
ohhh i gotta get outta here.
and im begging you.
im begging you.
im begging you to be my escape.

ive given up,
on doin this alone now.
now ive failed and im ready to be shown how.
show me the way,
becuase im trying to get there.
and this life sentence that im serving.
i admit that im every bit deserving.
but the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair.

and ive been housing al this doubt,
and insecurity.
and ive been locked inside that house.
all the while you hold the key.
and ive been dyin yo get out.
that might be the death of me.
and even know theres no way of knowing,
where to go i promise im goin becuase...

CHORUS:
ohhhhhh. i gotta get outta here.
im afraid that this complacencey is something i cant shake, yeah.
ohhhh i gotta get outta here.
and im begging you.
im bgging you.
im begging you to be my escape.

im held hostage,
to my own humanity.
self contained and able to live in this mess ive made.
adn all im askin is for you to do 
what you can with me.
becuase i cant ask you to give what you lalready gave...

and ive been housin all this doubt
and insecurity and ive been locked inside that house.
all the while you hold the key.
and ice been dying to get out.
but that might be the death of me.

and even though theres no way of knowin 
where to go i promise im going becuase...

ohhhh i gotta get outta here.
im stuck inside this rut that i fell into by mistake, yeah.
ohhhh i gotta get outta here 
and im begging you.
im begging you.
im begging you to be my escape.


i fought you for so long i shoulda let you in.
oh how we regret those things we did.
and all i was tryin to do was save my own skin.
ohh but so were you.
so were you.---Lyrics submitted by abby.
