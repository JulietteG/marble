Verse 1:
Turn up the record cause the songs just begun
Im smashing pumpkins like its November 1
Wish Britneyd hit me one more time on the phone
So tired of counting crows with Mr. Jones
My sister Hazel knows that its all for you
Am I a Blur or do you sing my Song 2?

Chorus:
Ooh, ooh, ooh summertime
Ooh, ooh, ooh back in 99
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh our first dance
Ooh, ooh, ooh thats my jam

Verse 2:
Janes addicted, and Alice is in chains
U2 like to move me in mysterious ways
Were chasing waterfalls and wanderwalls
My Jewel you were meant for me,
So save my soul
Add Seven Mary Three plus 98 degrees
Eve 6 times 311
Thats you and me

Chorus:
Ooh, ooh, ooh summertime
Ooh, ooh, ooh back in 99
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh our first dance
Ooh, ooh, ooh thats my jam

Verse 3:
This Blessid Union of Collective Souls
Is the only world we know
This heart-shaed candle box burns for you alone
You outta know

Chorus:
Ooh, ooh, ooh summertime
Ooh, ooh, ooh feelin so sublime
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh Boy II Man
Ooh, ooh, ooh my Pearl Jam

Ooh, ooh, ooh summertime
Ooh, ooh, ooh back in 99
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh take my hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh baby youre my jam---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
