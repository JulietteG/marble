Live a life of privilege
Pushing back the last, the lost, the least
The least of these
To dull the edge of conscience
With conceit

Live a life and see the world
Feel its weight on the shoulders
Of the least of these
It spins and twirls
Without rest of relief

We all, we all wear dignity
It covers the strong, the weak
We all, we all wear dignity
Even the last, the lost, the least

Step into a spacious place
Where pride and right will give way
To the least of these
To know the face
Of who a man can be

His image shown
When we give our lives, our time, our own
To feed, to clothe
Those in His image we have left alone
We all, we all wear dignity
God help the blind like me
Finding at last a voice we cry
And see with clear, unblinking eyes---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
