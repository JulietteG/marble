someone please save us
us college kids
what my parents told me 
is what i did

they said go to school 
and be a college kid 
but in the end
i question why i did

im bored
im starving
im flat broke
ive got no cash to spend 
sell all my books for front row tickets to dave matthews band

my girlfriends at another school
i know this year will test her
i called found out she had three other boyfriends last semester 

and thats why i say 
oh no
not for me not for me
call it torture 
call it university
oh arts and crafts is all i need
ill take calligraphy and then ill make a fake degree

80 grand later i found out that all that i had learned 
is that you should show up to take your finals and your midterms
the party scene is kinda mean
i think its sick and twisted
the navy showed up at my door and claimed that i enlisted

and thats why i say
oh no 
not for me not for me
call it torture call it university
oh no arts and crafts is all i need 
ill take calligraphy and then ill make a fake degree

dont get excited she'll say no without a doubt you see
so ive decided college girls just wont go out with me
they make me nervous and they always catch me off my guard 
like cell phone service ill drop out cause college is too hard

its time to call my father 
cause its his alma mater 
good grades arent what they seem
i think he knows the dean 
its time to call my father 
cause its his alma mater
he says hes proud of me
but college always was his dream 
and i would always say its not for me


oh no! not for me, not for me
call it torture, call it university
no! arts and crafts is all i need
i'll take calligraphy and then i'll make a fake degree

someone please save us, us college kids!
what my parents told me is what i did
they said go to school and be a college kid
but in the end i question why i did

do what will make you happy
do what you feel is right
only but one thing matters
learn how to live your life

what my parents told me is what i did

do what will make God happy
do what you feel is right
only but one thing matters
learn how to live your life---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
