It's been a year filled with problems,
and now you're here almost as if to solve them.
I can't live in a world without you now.
All my life I've been searching for you.
How did I survive in this world before you?
'Cause I don't wanna live another day without you now.


CHORUS::
This is the best thing, the best thing that could be happening.
And I think you would agree, the best thing is that it's happening to you and me.


All I wanna have is all that you can give me,
and I'll give right back, everything I have in me.
'Cause nothing's ever felt as right as this does right now.
I'll go back to before we met. 
Try and erase the past, try harder to forget 'cause,
nothing will ever be as good as here and now.


'Cause when I looked into your eyes, 
and you dared to stare right back,
you should've said, "Nice to meet you. I'm your other half.".


CHORUS 2X

The best thing is that it's happening to you and me.

I always knew I'd find someone.
I never dreamt it'd be like this.
'Cause you surpass all I've hoped for and ever wished.
And I'm tryin' so hard with all my heart and mind, 
to make your life as good as you've made mine.


CHORUS 2X

The best thing is that it's happening to you and me.
The best thing is that it's happening to you and me.
