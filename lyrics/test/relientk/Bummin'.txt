You can have my life, I'm sad
You can have the beat in my heart
You can be my light, pizazz
You can be my spark in the dark
But if I'm out there actin' the bum, I'll become one
So no more frigid nights in the cold
I would fall asleep in the lawn, 'til the sun rose
14 carat gold, gold
You can have my life, I'm sad

Broken down-town down on Wedgewood & Eighth
And I'm bleedin' like a heartache,
Get (or and?) ready to break
And then oh on down the road,
Comes another mistake
Try to hide as I might, I can't quite get it right
I'm bummin', oh
I'm bummin', oh

We can ride the bus all around in this town, I'm on it
We can fall asleep on the ground by the sound, I want it
Picture perfect, matted and framed, with my name right on it
14 carat gold, gold
You can have my life, I'm sad

Broken down-town down on Wedgewood & Eighth
And I'm bleedin' like a heartache,
Get ready to break
And then oh on down the road,
Comes another mistake
Try to hide as I might,
I can't quite get it right
I'm bummin',

Broken down-town down on Wedgewood & Eighth
And I'm bleedin' like a heartache,
Get ready to break
I'm burnin' in the sun,
And I'm barely awake
Try hard as I might,
I can't quite get it right
I'm bummin', oh
I'm bummin', oh

 I can't afford this bummin', no
I can't afford this bummin', no
I can't afford this bummin', no
I can't afford this bummin', no

So take this life you gave me
Save me from vices, oh
I can't afford this bummin', no
I'm in a crisis, oh
So take this life you gave me,
Save me from my vices
I'm bummin'
I'm bummin'

Broken down-town down on Wedgewood & Eighth
And I'm bleedin' like a heartache,
Get ready to break
And then oh on down the road,
Comes another mistake
Try to hide as I might,
I can't quite get it right
I'm bummin'
I'm bummin'

I can't afford this afford this bummin', no,
I'm in a crisis, oh
So take this life you gave me,
Save me from my vices---
