Yeah, Im not angry 
& no im not upset,
its taken me awhile 
but this is what ive learned, 
emotional attachment is really not a threat
when im simply not concerned

The things i take on
I soon shrug off
'cause i know no one 
will ever be content 
with the way things are 
or with what they've got
so i've given up and now im just indifferent. 

You will laugh at me 
like im not happy
with anything, anytime, anywhere
and the half of me's all about apathy, 
and the other half just doesnt care

I must admit all the words you spoke 
i hated 'cause i just dont see how i can be motivated
im left to break a sweat over a dying race
it seems our fate 
is something we've already embraced

Yeah, Im not angry 
and no im not upset  
its taken me awhile 
but this is what i've learned
emotional attachment it really not a threat 
when im simply not concerned

You will laugh at me 
like im not happy 
with anything, anytime, anywhere
and the half of me's all about apathy
and the other half just doesnt care

Yeah, bein apathetic's a pathetic way to be
[i dont care] 
What matters to you does not matter to me
[cause i dont care] 

So take a wild guess
it's like i just couldn't care less
if all the things you find impressive
just blew up and made those messes 
that you'll frantically repair 
like kissing leopards at the fair
and all the while youre unaware 
for this, you shouldnt care
but its so hard to see the reality 
that the end will be the end of things 
and our hearts are all we get to bring 
so let's go ahead make this worth something 

You will laugh at me
like im not happy 
with anything anytime anywhere
and the half of me's all about apathy
and the other half just doesnt care
[x1]

I'm well aware that everything 
is a cry from all right 
im well aware that all of us 
at times can be too uptight 
and possibly the remedy is a dose of apathy
You point your finger at you
and ill point mine right back at me.---Lyrics submitted by Sabre.
