I was thinking over thinking
'Cause there's just too many scenarios
To analyze
Look in my eyes
'Cause you're my dream 
Please come true

I was thinking over thinking
About exactly how I'm not exactly him 
I'll break my heart in two
More times than you could ever do
'Cause you're my dream
Please come true

'Cause I think way too much
On a one track mind
And you're so out of touch
'Cause I'm so far behind

I can't deny this anymore
The facts ignore all done before
And if there's one
In this world
You let me know you're not that girl

I was sinking, lower sinking
'Cause I lost the things I held on to
They let me think a thought 
A thought that I would know was not
Of seeing my dream 
Come true

I was thinking over thinking
About how far I had let this go
The more guy-girl clich 
I know now you're just in the way
Of me and my dream 
Come true

'Cause I think way too much
On a one track mind
And you're so out of touch
'Cause I'm so far behind
I'm trying to make sense
Out of all of this
While your fading scent
Just slips through my grip

I can't deny this anymore
The facts ignore all done before
And if there's one
In this world
You let me know you're not that girl

Don't touch the positive
With the negative end
Don't touch the positive
With the negative end
'Cause after all of the sparks
You're still alone in the dark
'Cause after all of the sparks 
You're left alone in the dark

And while I'm able to think 
I'll lable experience with you
As a mistake
And while I'm at it
I'll say I've had it
Experience with you
Is a mistake

'Cause I think way too much
On a one track mind
And you're so out of touch
'Cause I'm so far behind
I'm trying to make sense
Out of all of this
While your fading scent
Just slips through my grip

I was thinking over thinking
'Cause there's just too many scenarios
To think about
To figure out
If you're my dream
Please come true---Lyrics submitted by Marieke.
