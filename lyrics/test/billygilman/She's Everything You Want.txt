Cant you feel your heartbeat?
Its talking to your brain
A little voice inside you 
Keeps calling out her name
You can only lose if
You start to hesitate
So why ignore an open door
Showing you the way?

A heart cant shake it 
When it feels that rush
A heart cant fake it
When it needs that touch
A magic potion 
Locomotion
You cant ever stop
A heart cant take it
When shes everything you want

You cant stop you feet from
Walking to her door
Every time you leave her
You keep on wanting more
You think youre in control but
Whore ya tryin to kid?
When youre on your knees 
Beggin please
Give me one more kiss

A heart cant shake it 
When it feels that rush
A heart cant fake it
When it needs that touch
A magic potion 
Locomotion
You cant ever stop
A heart cant take it
When shes everything you want

Shes everything,
Shes everything,
Shes everything,
You need
Shes everything,
Shes everything,
Shes all you ever dreamed
Cant play it cool,
Actin like a fool
When you trying to deny
Youd do anything,
Everything yeah
Everything to be by her side

A heart cant shake it 
When it feels that rush
A heart cant fake it
When it needs that touch
A magic potion 
Locomotion
You cant ever stop
A heart cant take it
When shes everything you want---Lyrics submitted by beastly.
