30 thousand feet above
The city where I fell in love with you
And the fading country skyline
Brings an urban lullaby
That still rings true

When I passed you on the street that day
Shoulda let that rest gon' fly away
Like any chance I had of keeing you
Like the Northern Wind that blowin'
Yeah my lonely heart is frozen
Never knew I'd find a way to break yours too

Where the wind blows babe
You can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life
Just like I always did

Close your eyes babe
Take a breath, say my name
And I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

The city lights will light the country sky
We're staring at the stars in uside down
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find it in your heart to stick around
I hate it had to end this way
Tomorrow is a brand new day
And the chances of seeing love
Are precious few
If someone's out there waiting
For a sweet good time and lady
To make you smile like I always do

Where the wind blows baby
You can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life
Just like I always do

Close your eyes babe
Take a breath, say my name
And I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

So I found out
Our memories, my lullaby that love won't lie
If it's love done right
You'll be waiting on the other side
Arms open wide, if love don't lie
Lie, we can fly

Where the wind blows baby
You can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life
Like I always do

Close your eyes babe
Take a breath, say my name
And I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love---Lyrics submitted by Ashley B.
