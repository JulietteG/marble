Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this
Way?
I was dumb enough not to settle down when you wanted to
Now I'm sittin' here going crazy trying to crawl back to
You
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way?

But I was smart enough to come to my senses
Be who you need me to be
And if you say that I'm too late
I'll curl up and die in misery
Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way

I remember our first kiss on the 4th of July
I'll never miss another one of those
I'll be by your side

If my foolish heart was wrong,
This truly was never meant to be
Well I only hope that he'll count his lucky stars
And love you as much as me

Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way (3x's)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
