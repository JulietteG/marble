I'm nobody's wife and I'm nobody's baby
I like it that way but then again maybe
I'm nobody's valentine and I'm nobody's pearl
When you get right down to it
I always seem to find just some girl singing

There are monsters, there are angels
There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all
There is sugar and there is salt
There is ice and there is fire in every single heart
There are monsters, there are angels

I'm nobody's promise and I'm nobody's chore
And I ain't got nobody that I feel I gotta live for, nobody to live for
And I'm nobody's work and I'm nobody's company
Every time I turn around I always seem to find
Just me, singing

There are monsters, there are angels
There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all
There is sugar and there is salt
There is ice and there is fire in every single heart
There are monsters, there are angels

I'm nobody's wife and I'm nobody's baby
I like it that way, but then again maybe, then again maybe
I'm nobody's valentine and I'm nobody's pearl
When you get right down to it
I always seem to find just some girl, some girl singing

There are monsters, there are angels
There's a peacefulness and a rage inside us all
There is sugar and there is salt
There is ice and there is fire in every single heart
There are monsters, there are angels

Singing there are monsters, there are angels
Singing there are monsters, there are angels
(I'm nobody's wife and I'm nobody's baby)
Singing there are monsters, there are angels
(I'm nobody's mother)
Singing there are monsters, there are angels
(I'm nobody's child)
Singing there are monsters, there are angels---Lyrics submitted by Armando Rosich.
