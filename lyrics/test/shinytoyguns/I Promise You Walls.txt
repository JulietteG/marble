Loneliness
Is more than we'll ever feel
Blind as you are
Watching everything
When we die
Faith is lost...
Once again
Taking hold of all we are

Chorus
Who says we die?
Before we live
I promise you walls of grace
...to carry on
When we're lost
..Well find a way

Loneliness
Or should we say something more?
Oceans arise
Washing over me
Cold company
Dark shades of harmony
Chasing the lies no one believes...---Lyrics submitted by Ambrosia.
