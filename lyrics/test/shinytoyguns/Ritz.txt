Have you seen the well-to-do?
Upon Lanux Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air

High hats and coloured collars
White spats and fifteen dollars
Spending every dime
For a wonderful time

---

If you're blue
And you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat
Perfect fits
Puttin' on the Ritz

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary cooper
Super-duper

Come, let's mix where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks or "umbrellas"
In their mitts
Puttin' on the Ritz

Have you seen the well-to-do?
Up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air

High hats and arrow collars
White spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime
For a wonderful time---Lyrics submitted by Steffen.
