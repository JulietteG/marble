Standing there alone, the ship is waiting.
All systems are go. are you sure?
Control is not convinced,
but the computer has the evidence
No need to abort.
The countdown starts

Watching in a trance, the crew is certain.
Nothing left to chance, all is working.
Trying to relax, up in the capsule
"Send me up a drink.", jokes Major Tom.
The count goes on

4, 3, 2, 1
Earth below us,
drifting, falling, floating weightless
calling, calling home

Second stage is cut.
We're now in orbit
Stabilizers up, runnning perfect.
Starting to collect requested data.
"What will it affect when all is done?"
thinks Major Tom

Back at ground control,
there is a problem.
"Go to rockets full"
Not responding.
"Hello Major To,. are you receiving?
Turn the thrusters on.
We're standing by."
There's no reply.

4, 3, 2, 1
Earth below us
drifting, falling, floating weightless
calling, calling home

Across the stratosphere, a final message
"Give my wife my love."
Then nothing more

Far beneath the ship, the world is mourning.
They don't realize, he's alive.
No one understands, but Major Tom sees.
Now the light commands
this is my home, I'm coming home."

Earth below us,
drifting, falling.
Floating weightless
coming home
(repeat)
home .....---Lyrics submitted by Ivan.
