One look was all it took
With a glance I was drawn into your fire
'Cause you're so hot, you know you had me hooked
And nothing is gonna cool my desire

One look was all it took
I can feel my temperature is higher
'Cause your sexy ways are driving me insane
Got me up without a net, walking the wire

Oh heaven knows, I never felt these before
I'm over the moon
No one else could ever take me to the stars
There's something 'bout you

There's something 'bout you, ooh
There's something 'bout you
There's something 'bout you, ooh
There's something 'bout you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
