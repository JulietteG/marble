My temper got the best of me
And when I said that I mean
I know every single thing
That I said was true

And I know that youre mad at me
But if youre thinking like that
I think youll see that youre
Mad at you too

And I know the feelings strong
Strong enough to forget about
All that Ive been through

And it sounds obscene but
Loud words never bothered
Me like they do to you

Youre the boy
That talks but says nothing
A big game to the ones
That you think will believe you

But you dont know how to read
The look on my face when it says
Yeah, Ive read that book too

And who the hells impressed by you?
I want names of the people
That we know that are falling for this

You would sell your own mother out
And then betray your dead brother with another
Hypocritical kiss---
