My veins are blue and connected 
And every single bone in my brain is electric 
But I dig ditches like the best of 'em 
Yo trabajo duro 
Como en madera, y eso? 
Como en madera, y eso? 

And even God herself has fewer plans than me 
But she never helps me out when my scan's for free, though 
She grabs a stick and then she pokes it at me 
When I say nothing, I say everything 
Yeah when I say nothing, I say everything 

They put me down in a lazaretto 
Born rotten, bored rotten 
Making models of people I used to know 
Out of coffee and cotton 
And all of my illegitimate kids have begotten 
Thrown down to the wolves, made feral for nothing 
Quarantined on the Isle Of Man 
And I'm trying to escape any way that I can, oh 
Any way that I can, oh 

I have no time left 
Time is lost 
No time at all, throw it in a garbage can 
And I shake God's hand 
I jump up and let her know when I can 
This is how I'm gonna do it 

They wanna blow down the prison 
They're lighting fires with the cash of the masses 
And like the dough I don't fall down 
I'm so Detroit I make it rise from the ashes---
