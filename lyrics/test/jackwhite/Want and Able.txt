Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Tell me who,tell me who, tell me who

Well, Want and Able were crossing the road
Want had a feeling there was something he was owed
But Able broke it to him that there's a social code
So walk straight down the middle now and do what we're told
Walk straight down the middle now and do what we're told

Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Tell me who,tell me who, tell me who

Want said that didn't feel so good
To never be fulfilled, forever stressed out and impatient
Always saying, "Just over the next hill."
Always saying, "Just over the next hill."

Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Being able is to freedom what wanting is to cruel
It's hard to tell it seems, which one of them's the fool
Is freedom a gift, that we only give to the ones that say I love you?

Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Who is the who, telling who what to do?
Tell me who,tell me who, tell me who

Now, Want and Able are two different things
One is desire, and the other is the means
Like I wanna hold you, and see you, and feel you in my dreams
But that's not possible, something simply will not let me ---
