Spider got eight legs and I got two
This guitar's got six strings
What about you?
Well, what do you got?
What did you get for free?
Well, better get all your things together, girl
And make sure to give 'em all to me

Stone or rock ain't movin'
Neither is a tree
That may be good for you, girl
But it ain't good for me, I'm rollin'
Yeah, I'm takin' what I need for free
You still got to get it all together
Put it in the trunk of my car
And I'm gonna take it all for free

What do you got that I ain't got?
That's what I wanna know
Can I get a piece of it?
A piece before you go?
Well, give it up, yeah
Yeah, shove it right down my throat
oh (?) I got one last thing to say to you
Have you seen my coat?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
