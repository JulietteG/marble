Yeah, I got three women
Red, blonde hair, and brunette
I got three women
Red, blonde, and brunette
It took a digital photograph to pick which one I like

Well, I'm lonely at night, but I stay up until the break of day
Yeah, I'm lonely at night, but I stay up until the break of day
How come I gotta have a woman to blur these bruise away
Yeah, alright, I said

Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy lordy lordy Lord

Yeah, I got one in California and one back in Detroit
I got one in California and one back in Detroit
I brought my woman to Nashville, cast a bottle with her daddy all night

Yeah, well, she hogged my ashes, but she took them too far away
Yeah, she hogged my ashes, but she took them too far away
She said she loves her daddy
But only when she got bills to pay
Aw, listen, all right

Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy lordy lordy Lord

Yeah, yeah
Well, I wish I could tell you just what my three women do
Yeah, I wish I could tell you just what my three women do
But if I open my mouth, well, that'll be three women I lose

Yeah, now I know what you're thinking
What gives me the right?
Yeah, I know what you're thinking
What gives you the right?

Well, these women must be getting something
Cause they come and see me every night

Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord
Lordy lordy lordy Lord
