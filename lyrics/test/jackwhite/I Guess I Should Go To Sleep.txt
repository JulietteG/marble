One two three, two two three

I guess I should go to sleep
Too hard standing on my own two feet
Been walkin' too long on a dead end street
I guess I should go to sleep

I guess I'll take off my shoes
Head upstairs and then watch the news
That's another way to lose these walkin' blues
I guess I'll take off my shoes

Well upstairs, upstaged, and upset
Keeping quiet is probably my best bet yet
Cause I ain't managed to say the right thing yet
Well I guess I should go back to bed

Guess I should go to sleep
It's too hard standin' on my own two feet
Been runnin' too long on an endless street
Well I guess I should go to sleep
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep---
