You drink water
I drink gasoline
One of us is happy
One of us is mean
I love you
But honey, why don't you love me?
Yeah, well, I love you
But honey, why don't you love me?

Just one drink gets me closer
Just one drink, it rolls you over
But then I start to think you're growing colder
The older and older, I am

Well, I watch TV
You watch the ceiling
And when you turn over
I get a funny feeling
I should grab my rock and rye
And pop the top until my baby comes clean
yeah, I should grab my rock and rye
And pop the top until my baby comes clean

Well, just one sip and then you showed me
You bust your lip, I want spottieottie
So c'mon take one trip if you wanna know me
And put a fork in the road with me
Alright

Just one drink gets me closer
Just one drink, it rolls you over
But then I start to think you're growing colder
The older and older I am---
