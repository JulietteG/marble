Abba Dabba Dabba Dabba Dabba Dabba Dabba
Said the monkey to the chimp
Abba Dabba Dabba Dabba Dabba Dabba Dabba
Said the chimpy to the monk
All day long they chattered away
All night long they were happy and gay
Singin and swingin in a honky tonky way

Abba Dabba Dabba Dabba Dabba Dabba Dabba
Means means Chimp I love but you
Abba Dabba Dabba Dab in chimpy talk 
Means Monk I love  you too!
And the big babboon, by the light of the moon
He married them and very soon
They went upon their abba dabba honeymoon
