Aaaaaamen.
Everybody, everybody, be seated, please.
The sermon today is the meek shall inherit nothing.

Some take the Bible for what it's worth
When it says that the meek shall inherit the earth. 
But I heard that some shiek
Has bought New Jersey last week
And you suckers ain't getting nothing.

Is Hare Rama really wrong
When you wander around with a napkin on?
With a bell on a stick
And your hair is all gone?
The meek shall inherit nothing.

So you say your life is a bum deal
And you're up against the wall?
Well, you ain't really got no deal at all.
Cause what they do
In Washington
They just take care 
Of number one.
And number one ain't you.
You ain't even number two.
You ain't even number two.

Those Jesus freaks, well, they're friendly, but
The shit they believe has got their minds all shut up.
And they don't even care
If the church takes a cut.
Ain't it bleak when you got so much nothing?

So what do you do?

Eat that pork.
Eat that ham.
Laugh till you choke 
On Billy Graham.
Moses, Aaron, and Abraham,
They're all a waste of time.
And it's your ass that's on the line.
(And it's your ass that's on the line.)

Do what you wanna.
Do what you will.
Just don't mess up
Your neighbor's thrill.

When you pay the bill
Kindly leave a little tip
And help the next poor sucker
On his one-way trip.

Some take the Bible.
Some take the Bible.
Some take the Bible.---Lyrics submitted by Jim Fatka.
