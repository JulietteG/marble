It's not as if you didn't get the warning
You got the transcripts and recordings
History has a way of signing us up in the morning
But you're a late starter make it easy to ignore it
Later not recall it (yeah)

You had unfettered access to the facts
But the fact is your back was turned to the atlas
Nothing like not being in the crash test
To help you make your mind up - unknowingly the young sign up
The enemy of our enemy is still our enemy
So why are you arming them Is this insanity
That's how the Taliban began
Watch 'em as they turn around and aim their weapons at Americans
Hows it feel to be a widow maker
Taker of the father of the family
Your tragedy is fate - that's and stakes - so scoff at the Saigon link
Flash those pearlies Take us way past the brink

And we you knew you were frauds
But on wards we went to war
Nothing could be said to convince you
We've already seen it before

Someone could've told you it'd end like this
We did you didn't listen you can't take a trick
Lookin' back 2020 mistakes I got many
And the truth is that I'd probably do it again
No one could have ever hoped to sway your mind
We've been there before but it's not your time
Lookin' back 2020 mistakes I got many
And the truth is that I'd probably do it again

There's something familiar
About the story you told me
The way that you mouthed it, was not what you sold me
Well yes I'm one of many, yet you ignored the signs
You made it personal, don't spin me that line
You can't relax, 'cos it occurred on your watch
History will judge you 'cos you're all that we've got.
Is anyone listening? Are you fucking insane?
Am I to sit watching as it plays out again?

The truth is - we knew this - people aren't stupid
you play the innocent because you think we let you do it
If we think you're too ruthless
Show you where the point of the boot is
It's all about where the fuck the proof is
You keep an eye on the new kid - he's liable to do shit
If you don't keep a check on it - beyond your electorate
Peace in Iraq man, stay in Afghanistan
Lookin' for Osama, getting killed by the Taliban
War on drugs? War on terror, 9-11
We knew where Johnny stood - where's Kevin
Don't get me wrong - like alarm clocks from Heaven
Going off when the country woke up in '07
But there's no letting up - yo, we're just getting up
Off the canvas - that very fact demands that
We stay as vigilant as can be - Transparency
Another AWB - but we'll see

Even as we applaud
And we show them the door
thought we'd warn you that we're wary
'cos we've already seen it before

Someone could've told you it'd end like this
We did you didn't listen you can't take a trick
Lookin' back 2020 mistakes I got many
And the truth is that I'd probably do it again
No one could have ever hoped to sway your mind
We've been there before but it's not your time
Lookin' back 2020 mistakes I got many
And the truth is that I'd probably do it again---Lyrics submitted by Ryan Powell.
