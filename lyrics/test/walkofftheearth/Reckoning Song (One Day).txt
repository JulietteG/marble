One day baby well be old
Oh baby, well be old
Think of all the stories that we couldve told (x2)

No more tears, my heart is dry
I dont laugh and I dont cry
Dont think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

Had to go out of my door
Leave just like you did before
I know I said that I was sure
But rich man cant imagine poor

One day baby well be old
Oh baby, well be old
Think of all the stories that we couldve told (x8)

Little me and little you
Kept doing all the things we do
Theyd never really think it through
Like I can never think it true

Here I go again, the flame
The guilt, the pain, the hurt, the shame
The founding fathers of our plane
Thats stuck in heavy clouds of rain

One day baby well be old
Oh baby, well be old
Think of all the stories that we couldve told (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Samuel Matz.
