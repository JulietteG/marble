I know a place that will take you away
Your troubles no longer remain from the day
I found a love there it's hard to escape
It curse me at night, but it hurts when I wake

There's no judge and jury's at bay
Cause this is our house where melodies play
If worries still linger my friends and I say
Top up your cup and let's sing it all away

Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings
Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...

Sometimes people say don't burn your life away
But they don't hear this song it's just a holiday
From the go go go I say no no no worries
Here let's all just sway top up your cup
Let's sing it all away

Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings
Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh... carry you home
Oh oh oh...

The last call sounds, bartender says it loud
Just one more round before they kick us out
If you fall down I'll meet you on the ground
No worries here let's all just sway top up your cup
Let's sing it all away

Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings

Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away my darlings
Oh oh oh
Sing it all away, sing it all away and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...
and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...
and I'll carry you home
Oh oh oh...
and I'll carry you home
Just one more round
I'll carry you home
If you fall down

When worries still linger my friends and I say
Top up your cup and let's sing it all away---
