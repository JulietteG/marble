An angry note was on my car this afternoon
It's because of people like you
With raudy gaudy capitols with thunderlines too. 
It's because of people like you
Nothing in the way apart could word such a cold remark-
cold remark, cold. 
An angry note was on my car this afternoon
It's because of people like you!

CHORUS:
If one more person tries to show me thier faulty logic god help me, 
I will lend them brains to borrow wake up,
see what's real- tomorrow. 

I really am sure you hate people as much as I do
But try to write things are true. 
You know me (x5) Things true...
(chorus)
la, la, la, la, la, (etc.)
An angry note was on my car this afternoon 
It's because of people like you.---Lyrics submitted by Patricia.
