Hey Ozzie, Hey Ozzie

On the day after Christmas in 54
The greatest shortstop that every played before
Hed play the switch and thats a fact
Hed the Wizard of Oz theres no doubt about that

Hey Ozzie (Catch that ball)
Hey Ozzie (Youre the best of all)
Osborn Earl now thats his name
Brought a brand new level to the game
Hey Ozzie, Hey Ozzie

The Cardinals knew they got a special gift
When he took the field with his back flip
Diving left and right, Soaring up and down
On the yellow brick road to Coopers Town

Hey Ozzie (Yeah catch that ball)
Hey Ozzie (Youre the best of all)
The Wizard of Oz now thats his name
Hes going to the Hall of Fame
Hey Ozzie, Hey Ozzie

Known for his fielding, he learn to hit
In the 85 playoffs, gave the Dodgers a fit
I sorta thought this was just a hoax
Cause Jack Buck said, Go crazy, folks

Hey Ozzie (Playoffs MVP)
Hey Ozzie (Hell bunt or he can take you deep)
By going up the middle hell make you pay
By turning your head to a double play
Hey Ozzie, Hey Ozzie

Franky Frisch, Enos
Red, Lou Dizzy
Stan The Man, Lou Brock and Gibby
Theyre making his plaque and etching his face
So the Wizard of Oz can take his place
Hey Ozzie (Hes number one we love)
Hey Ozzie (Hes got thirteen gold gloves)
He played in fifteen All-Star games
Hes going to the Hall of Fame
Hey Ozzie, Hey Ozzie---Lyrics submitted by Walker Smith.
