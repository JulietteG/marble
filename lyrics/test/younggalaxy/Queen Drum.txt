Once I dwelled in the animal kingdom
Once I dwelled in the kingdom of life
I lose my sight when I try to reach them 
When I try to reach them I lose my sight

I'm the queen, I'm the drum
I'm the source over sea
Come in through the fields and the flowers
Come in the factories
It goes round the world and comes back to me

I close my eyes 
I lose the station
A hallucination
Up in the sky
I spin a web
On five great oceans
In devotion
I spin a web

I'm the queen, I'm the drum
I'm the source over sea
Come in through the fields and the flowers
Come in the factories
It goes round the world and comes back to me

It spoke from the heart
This dazzling prayer x3
It spoke from the heart
This dazzling prayer x3---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
