And love's light blue
Led me to you
Through all the emptiness that has become my home
Love's lies cruel
Introduced me to you
And at that moment I knew I was out of hope

Kill me, I begged and love said no
Leave me for dead and let me go
Kill me, I cried and love said no
Kill me, I cried and love said no

Love's icy tomb
Dug open for you
Lies in a cemetery that bears my name
Love's voilent tune
From me to you
Rips your heart out and leaves bleeding with a smile on my face

Kill me, I begged and love said no
Leave me for dead and let me go
Kill me, I cried and love said no
Kill me, I cried and love said no

And love's light blue
Took me from you
And at that moment I knew I was out of hope again

Kill me, I begged and love said no
Leave me for dead and let me go
Kill me, I cried and love said no
Kill me, I cried and love said---Lyrics submitted by Kenna Hale.
