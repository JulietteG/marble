Heaven ablaze in our eyes, 
we're standing still in time,
The blood on our hands is the wine
we offer as sacrifice

come on and show, them your love,
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul, my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly,
For your soul.

This endless mercy mile, 
We're crawling side by side, 
with hell freezing over in our eyes, 
Gods kneel before our crime

Come on lets show, them your love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul, my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
for your soul
(rip out the wings of a butterfly)
Don't let go
(rip out the wings of a butterfly)
For your soul

Come on and show, them your love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
For your soul, my love
Rip out the wings of a butterfly
for your soul
(rip out the wings of a butterfly)
Don't let go
(rip out the wings of a butterfly)
(rip out the wings of a butterfly)


For your soul---Lyrics submitted by Bethany.
