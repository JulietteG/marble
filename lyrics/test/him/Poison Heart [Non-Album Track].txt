no one ever thought this one would survive
helpless child,gonna walk a drum beat behind
lock you in a dream,never let you go
never let you laugh or smile,not you
well,just want to walk right out of this world
'cause everybody has a poison heart

I just want to walk right out of this world
'cause everybody has a poison heart

makin' friends with a hemeless torn up man
he just kind of smiles,it really shakes me up
there's danger on every corner but I'm ok
walkin' down the street trying to forget yesterday

you know that life really takes it's toll
and a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
so much damn confusion before my eyes
but nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives

I just want to walk right out of this world
'cause everybody has a poison heart---Lyrics submitted by rania.
