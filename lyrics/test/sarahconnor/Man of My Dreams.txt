[Verse 1:]
I remember the first day I met you
All I thought was dawn how can I get you
You below my mind in a very special way
Impossible for me to get away
Since that day you're creeping in my mind
Silky velvet ocean of green eyes
I'm dreaming of the day we meet again
But this time I won't let you slip away

[Chorus:]
Man of my dreams
Come in my life and fill my nights
With emotions and bliss
I wanna get to know your everything
Man of my dreams
There ain't no extreme there is no price
You don't have to compromise
I know you are my size

[Verse 2:]
Yesterday you took me by surprise
When you called just to see if I'm alright
My heart was jumping suffered an attack
Impossible for me to catch my breath
Here I am the feeling is so right
it's mutual and strong
'Cause tonight is the night
Just let it flow the way it
wants to go no need to hesitate
our star shines bright

[Chorus 3x]---Lyrics submitted by Kinan.
