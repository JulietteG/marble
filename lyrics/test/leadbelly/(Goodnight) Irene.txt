Irene good night Irene good night
Good night Irene Good night Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife have parted
I'm gonna take a little stroll downtown

Irene good night Irene good night
Good night Irene Good night Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Some times I live in the country
Some times I live in town
Some times I take a great notion
To jump in the river and drown

Irene good night Irene good night
Good night Irene Good night Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

Quit your rambling quit your gambling
Stop staying out late at night
Stay home with your wife and family
And stay by the fireside of right

Irene good night Irene good night
Good night Irene Good night Irene
I'll see you in my dreams
Irene good night Irene good night
Good night Irene Good night Irene
I'll see you in my dreams---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
