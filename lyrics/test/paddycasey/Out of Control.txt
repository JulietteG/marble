Your out of my hands... Your out of my life 
Your out of my plans ... It's not the way I wanted it to go 
It took me a while... to understand...but now I know 
Your out of my life... Your out of my hands 

Well I've said all I can say 
And your not listening anyway 
There's nothing left worth waiting for 
It's out of my control 
And all the tears I had I cried 
Nothing left now but goodbyes 
The only thing I need to know 
Is where do I go from here 

Did you not see... Did you not hear 
The trouble you caused... The signs were all so clear 
There was a time... I tried to mend 
But now I've lost the feeling... And I just can't pretend 
Well did you not see... And did you not hear 

Well I've said all I can say 
And your not listening anyway 
There's nothing left worth waiting for 
It's out of my control 
And all the tears I had I cried 
Nothing left now but goodbyes 
The only thing I need to know 
Is where do I go from here 
....Where do I go 

Is this really over... 
Tell me, can't you change your mind? 
Is There Nothing left here for you? 
Why can't we just try?. etc 

Well I've said all I can say 
And your not listening anyway 
There's nothing left worth waiting for 
It's out of my control 
And all the tears I had I cried 
Nothing left now but goodbyes 
The only thing I need to know 
Is where do I go from here---
