Come on, Ill be a no one
New way
Got you wrong, its not your fault
Sometimes Id rather be a cheat
You cant keep circling me
Case Im trying o hard to win joy every minute
Serious we are really well
We dont need you like a hole in the head

Come on, Ill be a no one
New way
Pay all the greatest sorrow
New way

Shooting star, change of heart
Something that you rarely see
Smell the lilies on me
Oh yeah

Wrong side, color inclined
That calls be
Serious we are really well
We dont need you like a hole in the head

Come on, I'll be a no one
New way
Pay all the greatest sorrow
New way
New way---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
