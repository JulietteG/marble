She's murder , murder in the first degree
Police, this woman is killin' me

The way she wears her lipstick and the powder on her face
she has knowledge of the weakness in the whole human race

She's murder , murder in the first degree
Police, this woman is killin' me

She's a good size 12  she wears a size 9
that gal ain't got nothin' but destruction on her mind

She's murder, murder in the first degree
Police, this woman is killin' me

Saw her Sunday morning, sitting high upon the hill
Took one look at her, Oh man what a thrill

She's murder, murder in the first degree
Police, this woman is killin' me---Lyrics submitted by oakland dupree.
