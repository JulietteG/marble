Look at you you're young
Havin' so much fun
Gonna be a star
Blah blah blah
And click there goes the phone
I don't wanna know
What my
Horoscope's predicting

Just pour me a drink
Cuz I need a kick
I don't wanna think
I just wanna sip

David don't you hear me at all
David won't you give me a call
Waitin' here not makin' a sound
David come around

Mister bushie says
I'm your president
I have lots to say
Hey hey hey
And click goes the remote
There you have my vote
Catchin' the next boat out of here

Just pour me a drink
Cuz I need a lie
I don't wanna think
I just wanna die

David don't you hear me at all
David don't you hear through the wall
Waitin' here not makin' a sound
David come around

Chaos pervades the world outside
Days offer spades of hurled outcries
Gone is the fair and five and dime
But he is there
He's so fine

Listen to her play
Has somethin' to say
Even has a rap
Clap clap clap
But click there goes the lid
Sorry 'bout the fib
I ain't got a grip on nothin'

Just pour me a drink
Right outta the can
I don't wanna think
I just want my man

David don't you hear me at all
David dear I'm just down the hall
Waitin' here not makin' a sound
David come around---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
