Father Let the world just fade away
let me feel your presence in this place
Lord I've never been so weary
How I need to know you're near me
Father let the world just fade away
Til Im on my knees
til my heart can sing

He is
He was
He always will be
even when it feels like there is no one holding me
be still, my soul
He is

Father let your holy spirit sing
let calm this storm inside of me
as I stand amazed
lift my hands and say

He is 
He was
He always will be
He lives
He loves
He always with me
even when it feels like there is no one holding me
be still my soul

Through every fear
and every doubt
In every tear I shed
down every road
I'm not alone
No matter where I am

He is 
He was
He always will be
He lives
He loves
He's always with me
even when it feels like there is no one holding me
be still my soul
be still and know
be still my soul
He is.---Lyrics submitted by janice.
