Look at you just standing out there in the dark
Making off like we were young
See you laughing as I look in your eyes
You're having fun

Wanna take your hand teach you what I know
And I hope it's not too late
To tell you all the things I never could
And could never wait

CHORUS:
I don't wanna lose you now
Can't you just be with me somehow?
Said I wanna be there
To see the lights along the way
I wanna hold you
'Til I get the chance to say
This world is dying without us, so please don't go away
I said I wanna be there

Remember times when you would only be afraid
Now you're running down those hopes and dreams
This love could never take those crazy turns
That it always seems

I see this beauty in my eyes
Now that I'm standing on this higher ground
I turn to look for love that was never lost
And could never be found

CHORUS

If everything goes the way I planned
You'll crawl right back to me
I'm just asking you to take my hand
So we can fly away, yeah

Said I wanna be there
To see the lights along the way
I wanna hold you
'Til I get the chance to say
This world is dying without us, so please don't go away
I said I wanna be there
Yeah, with you
Said I wanna be there
I wanna be there
''cause this world is dying without us, so please don't go away
I said I wanna be there, yeah

Look at you just standing out there in the dark
Making off like we were young
See you laughing as I look in your eyes
You're having fun, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
