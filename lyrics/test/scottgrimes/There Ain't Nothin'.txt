I'm sorry for what I said
I'm sorry for what I did
I know that you can't be blamed for all my pain
I know that it's time to leave
And you tell me you can't believe
In someone with no emotions and so cold

CHORUS:
Well I wanna live and I wanna die
I just wanna take off and get high
''cause there ain't nothin' in this world
There ain't nothin' you can see
I see your future now, and it's not with me
You say you're lonely
I'm confused and I've got nothin' left to lose
I am stronger now than I was before

I'm sorry for what I said
I'm sorry for what I did
I know that you can't be blamed for all my pain
I know that it's my time to leave
And you tell me you can't believe
In someone with no emotions and so cold

CHORUS

Whoa, be my guiding light
Whoa, and take me through the darkness of the night, hey

There ain't nothin' in this world
There ain't nothin' you can see
I see your future now, and it's not with me
You say you're lonely
I'm confused and I've got nothin' left to lose
I am stronger now than I was before
Yes, I am stronger now than I was before
Yeah, I am stronger now than I was before, yeah
I am stronger now---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
