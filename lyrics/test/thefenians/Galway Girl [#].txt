Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk 
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay 
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk 
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay 
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do 
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl 
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl 

We were halfway there when the rain came down 
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay 
And she asked me up to her flat downtown 
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay 
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do 
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl 
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl 

When I woke up I was all alone 
With a broken heart and a ticket home 
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do 
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
I've traveled around I've been all over this world 
Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl---Lyrics submitted by Jim.
