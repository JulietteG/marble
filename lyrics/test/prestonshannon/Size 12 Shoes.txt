I made it home early one night,
sober as a judge alright.
My woman looked supicious uptight, 
but it was what I saw that started the fight.
My dinner was half eat up,
My shower was cold enough for a duck.
The bed wasn't cold it was hot,
what i saw next made me wish I had buckshots.

Size 12 shoes under my bed,
baby you know I wear a size ten. 
Size 12 shoes under my bed,
baby you know I wear a size ten.

I love her so much It's shame,
found it in my heart to forgive her again.
i never forgot that pain,
though I never saw that barefooted man.

Size 12 shoes under my bed,
baby you know I wear a size ten.
Size 12 shoes under my bed,
Baby you know I wear a size ten---Lyrics submitted by Eunice Mcghee.
