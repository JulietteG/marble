Another night I'll stay uplate
Upon myself someone and celebrate
I'll be just fine, go on and leave
But don't you turn around, 'cause you might see

That I can't stop the rain
Falling from my eyes
I can't find the tears
I'm holding back inside
And this poor heart of mine
It's crying up for you
And nothing I can do
Since you put up the flame
I can't stop the rain

Chorus: Stop the rain, stop the rain x2

It always hearts when love is gone
I'm packing up my dreams and moving on
Baby, I'll forget all of you this time
So close the door before I changed my minde

I can't stop the rain
Falling from my eyes
I can't find the tears
I'm holding back inside
This poor heart of mine
It's crying up for you
And nothing I can do
Since you put up the flame
I can't stop the rain

When love comes around
I'll take my chance again
If I'm so happy to know
This time to see love in
So tell me why
I cant stop the rain

Chorus: Stop the rain, stop the rain

Fallin, falling, falling from my eyes

Chorus: Stop the rain, stop the rain

Oo-oh
I can't stop the rain
Falling from my eyes
I can't find the tears
I'm holding back inside
And this poor heart of mine
It's crying up for you
And nothing I can do
Since you put up the flame...

This poor heart of mine
It's crying up for you
And nothing I can do
Since you put up the flame
I can't...

Chorus: Stop the rain, stop the rain

When I'm on alone I cry...

Chorus: Stop the rain, stop the rain

And I don't want, I don't want, I don't wanna cry...

Chorus: Stop the rain, stop the rain

You just see the tears falling...

Chorus: Stop the rain, stop the rain

Stop this tears, stop this tears...

Chorus: Stop the rain, stop the rain

Falling, falling, falling from my eyes...

Chorus: Stop the rain, stop the rain (fading)---Lyrics submitted by Hubert.
