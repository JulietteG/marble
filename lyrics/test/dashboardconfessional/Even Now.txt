Even now,
I can smell your clothes,
Freshly from the wash,
Still hot from the dryer.

Even now,
I can smell your skin,
As I wrap you in a towel,
Lay you on the bed,
And try to love you.

Even now,
I can feel your arms,
I can feel your breasts,
I can hear your songs.
And I always can find you again.

Even now,
I can feel your hand,
Gently over mine,
With almost no weight at all.

Even now,
I can feel your eyes,
Watch me as I strum,
Much too late at night.

Even now,
I can see you smile,
I can hear you hum,
I can hear you sing.
And I always can find you again.

Even in the dark of night,
Even in the lowest light.
Even as the world outside,
Is spinning,
And spinning.

Even now,
I can feel your hair,
Blow across my cheek,
As we sit in one of two chairs.

Even now,
I can feel your face,
Resting on my chest,
Wrestling for sleep,
And failing at it.

Even now,
I can see you sleep,
I can see you dream,
I can see you fly.
And I always can find you again.
And I always can find you again.
And I always can find you again.---Lyrics submitted by Lacie.
