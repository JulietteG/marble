Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And covered with a perfect shell
Such a charming, beautiful exterior
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes
Perfect posture
But youre barely scraping by, 
But youre barely scraping by.

Well, this is one time
Well, This is one time
Where you cant fake hard enough to please 
Everyone or anyone at all
Or anyone at all
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you built to flee
The places that you come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most

Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
Hidden in the public eye
Such a stellar monument to loneliness
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes
Perfect makeup
But youre barely scraping by
But youre barely scraping by

Well, this is one time
Well, This is one time
Where you cant fake hard enough to please 
Everyone or anyone at all
Or anyone at all
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you built to flee
The places that you come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most

And you cant fake it hard to enough to please
Everyone or anyone at all
Or anyone at all
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you built to flee
The places that you come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most---Lyrics submitted by madison.
