I'm missing your bed 
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd speak
And this bottle of beast
Is taking me home

I'm cuddling close
To blankets and sheets
But you're not alone, and you're not discreet
Make sure I know who'd taking you home

I'm reading your note over again
There's not a word that I comprehend
Except when you signed it
I will love you always and forever

Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs 
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone
Making out

I'm missing your laugh
How did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending

I'm cuddling close
To blankets and sheet
I am alone
In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home

I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots were we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home

Well as from now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
And as for me I wish that I was anywhere with anyone
Making out

Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking it's wear
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking it's wear---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
