ALWAYS ASSUMING THE WORST
BUT YOU'RE GOING ON NONETHELESS
AND THERE'S NOTHING TO CUSHION YOUR HEART LED FALL
LETTERS FROM FURTHER AWAY
KEEP PULLING ME CLOSE TO HOME
WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING TO SOFTEN YOUR CALLOUSES
I KNOW THAT YOU HOPE FOR- LONG GOOD, GOODBYES 
AND BRACING FOR FOREVER
AND FALLING IN YOUR RISE- IN YOUR RISE, YOUR EYES

POURING OVER PHOTOGRAPHS
I'M LIVING IN YOUR LETTERS
BREATHE DEEPLY FROM THIS ENVELOPE 
IT SMELLS LIKE YOU AND I CAN'T BE
WITHOUT THAT SCENT IT'S FILLING ME WITH
ALL YOU MEAN TO ME.... TO ME

CONTINUALLY FAILING THESE TRIALS 
BUT YOU STAND BY ME NONETHELESS
AND YOU WON'T LET ME STAY THOUGH I AM BEGGING YOU... 
I AM BEGGING YOU
PHONE CALLS FROM FURTHER AWAY... 
AND MESSAGES ON MY MACHINE
BUT I DON'T EVER TELL YOU THAT DISTANCE SEEMS TERRIBLE
THERE'S NO NEED TO TEST MY HEART WITH USELESS SPACE
THE ROADS GO ON FOREVER
THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A PLACE
FOR YOU.. IN MY HEART

SO I'LL EAT THE PAVEMENT IT'S GOTTA BE BETTER THAN WAITING
I'M PUSHING YOU FAR AWAY CAUSE I'M SCARED
SO I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES AND HEAD ON MY WAY UP THERE
CAUSE TURNING TO YOU IS LIKE FALLING IN LOVE WHEN YOUR 10...---Lyrics submitted by Jenni.
