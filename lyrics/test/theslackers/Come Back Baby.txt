Where are you tonight my love
This I'm asking to the stars up above
When will you be coming home
Cause I'm afraid to be alone
Long before we met that summer
I was sure I would never love another
Now I know I was wrong so wrong
My honey why you gone so long

Come back baby, come back baby
Come back baby the joke is done, now come on home
Distance makes the hear grow fonder
But honey you don't have to wander
To make me say those three words

My head is heavy, my heart is filled with pain
And I fear that this feeling will remain
Go to sleep, go to sleep now I pray you'll find no harm
And then I dream your in my arms
And I keep asking you...

To come back baby, come back baby
Come back baby the joke is done, now come on home
Distance makes the heart grow fonder
But honey you don't have to wander
To make me say those three words---Lyrics submitted by Pat.
