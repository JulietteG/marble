She calls him early
cause she knows he'll be asleep
she leaves a message after the beep

she says shes better now
but shes still incomplete
shes trying hard to make her voice sound soft and sweet

a couple hours pass till he picks up the phone
he wasnt ready for the shock
he holds his breath down

he plays the message twice
and then the dial tone reminds him that shes not around
its a lonely sound

hes got perspective
and shes got nothin left
and he wonders why he cant go on

hes singin
could she would she have been thinking of me all along and if i asked her would she tell me the truth
cause its a long way down when your hopes are high as mountains
and i am worried that im falling for you

shes like an hour glass that never got the sand
she is hollow and transparent like an infant
hes a lonely boy but he still loves his life
he doesnt look to make a scene
he looks to make right

hes got perspective
and shes got nothin left
and he wonders why he cant go on

hes singin
could she would she have been thinking of me?
all along and if i asked her
would she tell me the truth?
cause its a long way down when your hopes are high as mountains
and i am worried that im falling for you

im holdin out
im strong and im proud
and theres a new heart ive got thinkin on me
its time you place yourself
take a look at this girl and youll see what i see

could she would she have been thinking of me?
all along and if i asked her
would she tell me the truth?
cause its a long way down when your hopes are high as mountains
and i am worried that im falling for you


could she, would she be thinking of me?
all along
and if thats true, would she tell me the truth?

cause its a long way down when your hopes are high as mountains
and i am worried that im falling for you

sayin
its a long way down when your hopes are high as mountains
and i am worried that im falling for you---Lyrics submitted by Iris.
