And it doesnt't matter
How you feel now, anything at all
Seems to be your only way, so vicious
Heavenly apart.

When your envy is on a piece of paper
Let me sweetly smile
You're devouring all the crumbs
I'm leaving caught up in your lies.

You're on any other side.

"Clawing up my eyes
I'm feeling your arms around me
On the other side.
It's time to go
I'm hearing your voice
Without words
On the other side"

But it doesnt't matter
How I feel, anything at all
Since I've left you with the wrong.
Impression while I'm still the same.

When I turn around and look
At my life, shadows in disguise
But i'm working on
An interruption of hypocrisy.

Your on any other side.

"Chorus"

Any other side---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
