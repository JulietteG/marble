I don`t understand
I don`t know what to do
Once again I felt you even realise
The cross and that you think I bring
Doesn`t care, doesn`t think
I don`t listen anymore
Don`t try to change your life with mind

I live in the dark side upside down laughing at my disaster
I live in the dark side upside down laughing at my disaster

I don`t understand
Why do you feel confused
Once again you felt you even realise
The cross and that you think I bring
Doesn`t care, won`t you believe
Doesn`t listen anymore
Don`t try to change your life with mind

I live in the dark side upside down laughing at my disaster
I live in the dark side upside down laughing at my disaster

I don`t understand
Why do you feel confused
Once again you felt you even realise

I live in the dark side upside down laughing at my disaster
I live in the dark side upside down laughing at my disaster

(Upside down) Live in my disaster
(Upside down) Live in my disaster
(Upside down) Live in my disaster
(Upside down) Live in my disaster---Lyrics submitted by Phoebe.
