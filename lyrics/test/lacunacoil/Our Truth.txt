Clock is ticking while I'm killing time
Spinning all around
Nothing else that you can do
To turn it back
Wicked partnership in this crime
Ripping off the best
Condescending smile trying to forget (Wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (Telling more lies)
We're raising our truth
Go on and tease me

Clock is ticking while I'm stealing time
Can't you turn it back?
Stop the cycle
Set it free and run away
Silent sneaking along my path
Rugged the road
But we feel it like we're flying

Trying to forget (Wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (Telling more lies)
We're raising our truth---Lyrics submitted by Matty.
