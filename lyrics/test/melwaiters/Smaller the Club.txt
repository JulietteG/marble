Johnny Taylor, still the favorite
And Bobby Bland, still the blues
5 dollars you got to pay 
Just a jukebox and no DJ
Just a jukebox and no DJ

The smaller the club, the bigger the party
Something about this room
The smaller the club, the better the party
The dance floor, you can barely move

Waitress please, clean my table
Beer cans everywhere
Music's loud, and everybody's dancing (Yeah) A hell of a party up in here
There's a hell of a party up in here, Oh Yeah

You gotta stand in line to get a drink, gotta wait outside
You've gotta wait outside, just to get a peek 
Everyone loves (Everyone loves) a smaller club, you might meet someone
You might meet someone there, and fall in love

The smaller the club, the bigger the party
Something about this room (Yes it is)
The smaller the club, the better the party
The dance floor, you can barely move

[Solo]

The smaller the club, the bigger the party
Something about this room (Yes it is)
The smaller the club, the better the party
The dance floor, you can barely move

Johnny Taylor, is still the favorite
And Bobby Bland, still the blues
5 dollars you've got to pay 
Just a jukebox and no DJ
Just a jukebox and no DJ

Beer cans on the table 
Cigarette smoke, Ciggarette Smoke
Cigarette smoke in the air, yes it is!
Music's loud, and everybody dancing yeah
There's a hell of a party up in here, oh yeah

The smaller the club, the bigger the party
Something about this room (Yes it is)
The smaller the club, the better the party
The dance floor, you can barely move

Oooo yeah, come on
Oooo they backed up in here
Yeah they up in here pa
But what I want to know is: How does all those people get on that small dancefloor?
I don't know they get out there 

They waitin outside in front just to get in
Hell of a crowd too, you know?
Just to get a peep to see what's goin' on up in here
But it's on!
Lemme tell ya again!

The smaller the club, the bigger the party
Something about this room, Something about this room (Oh yeah) 
The smaller the club, the better the party
The dance floor, you can barely move, The dance floor, you can barely move
Somebody say it one more time!

The smaller the club, the bigger the party (Smaller the club, the bigger the party!)
Something about this room (Something about, something about this room!)
The smaller the club, the better the party
The dance floor you can barely move
The dance floor you can barely move
Hey, Hey!
The smaller the club, the bigger the party, Oh yeah!
Something about this room
Something about this room---Lyrics submitted by Geordi.
