Behind the glass,
I watched the world,
From cracks the blinds make when they're drawn,
I watched the world for years this way,
And that catches us up to this moment today,

Quarantine,
The rock and the hard place I'm between,
Quarantine,
Quarantine,
Quarantine,

And it was you I did this for,
I put the dead bolt on the door,
Understand I can't see you now,
Realize it's not to keep me in, but to keep all the sickies out,

Quarantine,
Such an ugly word for what I mean,
Quarantine,
Quarantine,
Quarantine,

I heard you let some little flea,
Give you that contagious disease,
You let him climb right on you two,
And it's been plaguing me, too,

lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Realize it's not to keep me in, but to keep all the sickies out

Quarantine,
The rock and the hard place I'm between,
Quarantine,
Quarantine,
Quarantine,
Quarantine,
Quarantine,
Quarantine,
oh, oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
