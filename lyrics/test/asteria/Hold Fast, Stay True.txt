Come on down I need the inspiration
Like to find myself in a sticky situation
Fist and knives I won't last a night
But in a battle of wits I swear I'd survive
And I've been running down this long road 
Chasing dreams we've fallen down and gotten up and almost rip apart at the seems
We can taste it now it's sweet
It's soft and it's on our lips
And you can sing it back
You can sing it

Come on take off your shoes
Get comfy we're ready to roll
The time is now 
The stage is set 
Let's give them a show
Come on we're moving too fast 
This town is so slow
The lights get bright
The crowd gets down
And I feel high

Sitting in limbo
You're feet keep the tempo
Blue skies in our eyes
This drop means the rest of our lives
You can send the rains to flood us out
And try to silence me (shhh)
But so long as we breathe 
We'll leave them with something to sing

Come on take off your shoes
Get comfy we're ready to roll
The time is now 
The stage is set 
Let's give them a show
Come on we're moving too fast 
This town is so slow
The lights get bright
The crowd gets down
And I feel high

Boys are boys and kids will dream 
Just victims in this scene 
We can't sweat it out no matter how hard we play 
We can taste it now it's sweet it's soft it's on our lips 
And you can sing it back 
You can sing it---
