So this is it, The feeling that I've missed
A subtle kind of pain that keeps me from sleep
I tried to explain your touch drives me insane
I can't spend the night with the shame i was with

CHORUS:

Wanna tell you a secret and leave it on your lips
Wanna sing it through your body
Wanna tell it through this kiss
If i told you my secret, would you swear to keep it?
would you swear to keep it?

Watching you dance, seeing you smile
Still getting butterflies every once in awhile
Feelings exist, I'm falling
Twist on lust, a choice to care
A wish to touch

CHORUS:

Wanna tell you a secret and leave it on your lips
Wanna sing it through your body
Wanna tell it through this kiss
If i told you my secret, would you swear to keep it?
would you swear to keep it?

When you say never, I'll say lie
When you say always, I'll say true
When you say love, I'll say you
I'll say you (2X)
They'll say you (2x)

CHORUS:

Wanna tell you a secret and leave it on your lips
Wanna sing it through your body
Wanna tell it through this kiss
If i told you my secret, would you swear to keep it?
would you swear to keep it?

That's all people! Hopefully I'll make more!---Lyrics submitted by Anton.
