Clothes make the man
The house makes the heart
Don't get me started
'Bout how hard it is to start or stay on track
Or don't dream or do whether you want or won't not to

Whatever I do the radio took me the radio radio made me
What can I do but dream
What can we do but listen to stories wretched or glorious
As if me and you
In other scenes

I don't mind if its raining
I don't mind if its hard
I don't mind what you're thinking
I don't mind if you're not

Whatever I do the airways they took me the radio radio made me
What can I do but dream
What can we do but listen to stories wretched or glorious
As if me and you
In other scenes

Where I found my eyes
This loving it took me
Somedays I walk into my

The sun makes the rain

A little cold to see clear
A little cold to see clear
Cold to see clear
A little cold to see clear
A little cold to see clear

Whatever I do the airways they took me the radio radio makes me
What else can I do but dream
What can we do but listen to stories wretched or glorious
As if me and you
In other scenes

Where I found my eyes
This loving it took me
Somedays I walk into my
The sun makes the rain

I don't mind if its raining
I don't mind if its hard
I don't mind what you're thinking
I don't mind if you're not---
