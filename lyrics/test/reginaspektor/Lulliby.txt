I know that you cannot be here
I know that you are not mine now
Looking out the window
At another window
I see toenails changing colours
Like the leaves of fall
If you often smile but often don't smile
Which do you do more often
Smile or not?
I dreamt hydrant was covered in snow
White light glowing below
I know that you cannot be here
I know that you are not mine now
Looking out the window
At another window
I see toenails changing colours
Like the leaves of fall---
