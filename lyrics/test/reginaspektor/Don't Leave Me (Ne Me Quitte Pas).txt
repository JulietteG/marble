Down on bowery they lose their 
Ball-eyes and their lip-mouths in the night, 
And stumbling through the streets they say, 
"sir, do you have a light?" 
And if you do then you're my friend, 
And if you don't then you're my foe, 
And if you are a deity of any sort 
Then please don't go. 

Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 

And down on lexington they're wearing 
New shoes stuck to aging feet, 
And close you're eyes and open, 
And you'll recognize the aging street, 
And think about how things were right 
When they were young and veins were tight 
And if you are the ghost of Christmas past 
Then wont you stay the night? 

Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 

Down in bronxy-bronx the kids go 
Sledding down snow-covered slopes 
And frozen noses, frozen toes 
The frozen city starts to glow 
And yes, they know that it'll melt 
And yes, the know new york will thaw 
But if you are a friend of any sort 
Then play along and catch a cold! 

Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 
Ne me quitte pas, mon chere 
Ne me quitte pas 

I love Paris in the rain. 
I love, i love, in the rain...---
