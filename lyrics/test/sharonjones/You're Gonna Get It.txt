Some love makes you helpless
Some love makes you strong
And some makes you do right
And some makes you do wrong

Believe me when i tell you
I got the kind of love
That's gonna make you higher baby
Than what you're dreaming of

And I'm gonna give it to you
Aww baby
(my love)
And I'm gonna give it to you
Aww baby
(my love)
I'm gonna give it you you
Aww baby
(my love)
You're gonna get it

Now I'm no professor baby
But I know a few things
Ya see, a rooster needs a sunrise
Before he rises up and sings

A fish without no water
Is a fish that cannot swim
And if you want a man to be his best friend
You gotta give him, give your love to him

And I'm gonna give it to you
Ooh baby
(my love)
I'm gonna give it to you
Ooh baby
(my love)
I'm gonna give it to you
Ooh baby
(my love)
You're gonna get it

(interlude)

Some love makes you helpless
Some love makes you strong
And some love makes you do right
And some love makes you do wrong

If you want to know what love can do
Open up your arms and you won't regret it
I got a mighty kind of love in store
You're gonna get it

I'm gonna give it to you
Aww baby
(my love)
I'm gonna give it to you
Aww darlin
(my love)
I'm gonna give it to you
Aww baby
(my love)
You're gonna get it ---Lyrics submitted by cristian.
