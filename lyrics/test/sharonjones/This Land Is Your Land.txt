This land is your land This land is my land 
From California to the New York island; 
From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters 
This land was made for you and Me. 

As I was walking that ribbon of highway, 
I saw above me that endless skyway: 
I saw below me that golden valley: 
This land was made for you and me. 

I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps 
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts; 
And all around me a voice was sounding: 
This land was made for you and me. 

When the sun came shining, and I was strolling, 
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling, 
A voice was chanting and the fog was lifting: 
This land was made for you and me. 


This land is your land This land is my land 
From California to the New York island; 
From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters 
This land was made for you and Me. 

When the sun came shining, and I was strolling, 
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling, 
A voice was chanting and the fog was lifting: 
This land was made for you and me.---Lyrics submitted by ervin.
