The time has come to test the faith of all mankind
To live or die, or make a better way
We've reached a crucial time
And dickering about our differences
Will only feed the pain
We must retain the positive
And follow Gods message again
Who remembers the time gone by
When peace and love ruled the day
Who remembers those mighty words
Of all of Gods messengers

Love, love, love is the only way
Love, love, love is the only way

There's only so many messengers in each generation
There's only so many precious signs in each visitation
There's only so many messengers in each generation
There's only so many precious signs in each visitation

Brother Bob he worked so hard to show us the light
And how could we be so arrogant
And disregard his loving advice
Who remembers the time gone by
When peace and love ruled the day
Who remembers those mighty words
Of Mohammed and Jesus and Moses

Love, love, love is the only way
(Listen to these words of aid)
Love, love, love is the only way
(Let the scriptures inside)
Love, love, love is the only way
(Let your conscience open wide)
Love, love, love is the only way
(The fightin' must be done
For we all return to the same one)

There's only so many messengers in each generation
There's only so many precious signs in each visitation
There's only so many messengers in each generation
There's only so many precious signs in each visitation

We still have time to stop the sufferin'
(Love, love, love is the only way)
Stop the slaughter
Of innocent children
(Love, love, love is the only way)
Peace in Gaza
Peace in Bosnia
(Love, love, love is the only way)
We are all believers
On this time of great sufferin'---Lyrics submitted by millermongz.
