Straight to my heart
Straight to my heart and I can't live without you 

You had something I can tell you
I could not resist
No escaping those emotions
I had to take the risk
Following your light
You gave me back the smile 
That I've been searching for
From the moment we touched 

Chorus
You just went straight to my heart
Nothing could make me move
You just went straight to my heart
I had to let you come through
You just went straight to my heart
And I cant live without you 

First impressions last the longest
You just got to me
I was a prisoner 
So many bad times
You just set me free
With you I belong
In the shelter of your loving arms
I will come to no harm


Chorus
With you I belong
In the shelter of your arms
I will come to no harm 

Chorus
There was no recovery
You satisfy the need in me
Every night and every day---Lyrics submitted by nel.
