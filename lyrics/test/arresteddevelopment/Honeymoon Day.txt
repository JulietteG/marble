Girl, just take off yo socks, let me lick on yo feet
I'll rub yo body and watch you roll yo eyes to the ceiling
Won't you lay on down? Let my face be yo linen
C'mon and sho me yo ways, this is our honeymoon day

Let's just free our bodies like the last day of living
Girl, we can be real naughty, there's no need for forgiving
Won't ya dance for me? Let my face be your mirror
C'mon and sho me yo ways, this is our honeymoon day

It's ya charming one, ranked at number one
The one you know to go to when you need some lovin' to come
And even though I'm just a hop and a skip and a jump
Away, baby, sometimes we role play the funk

Yo secret thing like a one night fling
That just happened to be married to you and
Gave you a ring, so no guilt just pleasure
So much dat it's known to tilt the measure

Yo touch has been known to ease my pressure
Oh my God
It's so incredible the way he shaped your bod
Ingenious mixing soft wit hard
Little sweet, little heat, spicy, hot

Gotta a lot a seeds, I wanna put in yo sod
I can't see your face, if ya feel me just nod
Girl, yous da picket fence house and the yard
Da picket fence house and the yard, hu huh

Girl, just take off yo socks, let me lick on yo feet
I'll rub yo body and watch you roll yo eyes to the ceiling
Won't you lay on down? Let my face be yo linen
C'mon and sho me yo ways, this is our honeymoon day

Let's just free our bodies like the last day of living
Girl, we can be real naughty, there's no need for forgiving
Won't ya dance for me? Let my face be your mirror
C'mon and sho me yo ways, this is our honeymoon day

Check it out
I told yo Mama don't wait up, don't check up on us
Don't call we handled it all, I'm ready to bust
And I'm really hoping that yo daughter can handle my lust
You done had yo chance, now this land is handed to us

Pop's knows how it goes shewt any man does
Fine daughter like his can't afford to miss love
And I'm a give it to her sho nuff without a flub
Give it her like a fat man giving himself grub

You think we waited for nothing, my blood's pumping
Needs go to where it's needed the most
Relieve something shewt certain parts of me resemble a mule
Stiff and stubborn, it's like I'm Rosa Parks on the stool

We going all out hittin' the balls out
Coming deep from the soul like a Lou Rawls shout
People next door screamin' who let the dogs out
Man, it's our honeymoon, we here to knock the walls out

Girl, just take off yo socks, let me lick on yo feet
I'll rub yo body and watch you roll yo eyes to the ceiling
Won't you lay on down? Let my face be yo linen
C'mon and sho me yo ways, this is our honeymoon day

Let's just free our bodies like the last day of living
Girl, we can be real naughty, there's no need for forgiving
Won't ya dance for me? Let my face be your mirror
C'mon and sho me yo ways, this is our honeymoon day

When I say true, you say love, true love, true love
You got a wedding ring, put it up, put it up
You got a wedding ring, throw it up, throw it up
Oh yeah, it's on, baby, I've waited for this so long
Oh yeah, it's on, baby, when I hang up the phone I'm gone

We gonna bail collect that mail, let's go to the hotel and
Skip the reception, girl, let's head to the limo
Tinted window hard to find like Nemo
Real Cancun, real honeymoon like woo
You can find us on the beach you know
I'm in heaven daily 'cuz I'm lovin' this, the physical bliss
Come here, baby, give me a kiss

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Girl, just take off yo socks, let me lick on yo feet
I'll rub yo body and watch you roll yo eyes to the ceiling
Won't you lay on down? Let my face be yo linen
C'mon and sho me yo ways, this is our honeymoon day---Lyrics submitted by elen novilia.
