Life is easy when you're up on the mountain
 And you've got peace of mind like you've never known.
 But then things change and you're down in the valley.
 Don't lose faith for you're never alone.

For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley.
 When things go wrong, He'll make it right.
 And the God of the good times
 is still God in the bad times.
 The God of the day is still God in the night.

You talk of faith when you're up on the mountain.
 Oh but the talk comes easy when life's at its best.
 But it's down in the valley of trials and temptation
 That's when faith is really put to the test.

For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley.
 When things go wrong, He'll make it right.
 And the God of the good times
 is still God in the bad times.
 The God of the day is still God in the night.

For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley.
 When things go wrong, He'll make it right.
 And the God of the good times
 is still God in the bad times.
 The God of the day is still God in the night.
 The God of the day is still God in the night.---Lyrics submitted by Tammy Lynne Hef.
