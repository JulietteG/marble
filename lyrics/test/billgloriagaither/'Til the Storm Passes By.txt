In the dark of the midnight
I alt hid my face
While the storms howled above me
Seemed there was no hiding place
But mid the crash of the thunder
Precious Lord hear my cry
Keep me safe til the storm passes by.

Now when the long night has ended
And the storms come no more
Let me dwell in the presence on that bright and peaceful shore
There in the land where the tempest never comes 
Lord may I dwell with thee til the storm passes by.

Oh...til the storm passes over
Til the thunder sounds no more
Til the clouds just roll forever from the sky
Hold me fast, let me stand, in the hall of thy hand
Keep me safe til the storm passes by

Oh...til the storm passes over
Til the thunder sounds no more
Til the clouds just roll forever from the sky
Hold me fast, let me stand, in the hall of thy hand
Keep me safe til the storm passes by

Lord...Keep us safe til the storm passes by.---Lyrics submitted by Darla.
