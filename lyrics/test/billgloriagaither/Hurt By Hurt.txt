Nobody saw it, nobody noticed just how it started,
Wounds that were silent wordless and cruel tore me apart;
And nobody saw how I died,
Died inch by inch on the inside

Hurt by hurt
The painful memories waiting in line,
Hurt by hurt
I build a wall one  hurt at a time

Gentle as rain drops welcome as morning after the darkness,
Without a warning love broke right through invading my heart;
You walked hurt by hurt through my past,
And melted the barriers at last.

Hurt by hurt,
The painful memories waiting in line;
Hurt by hurt,
You heal them all one hurt at a time.

I praise your name
So glad you came,
Oh Jesus where would I be,
Without you.

Hurt by hurt,
The painful memories waiting in line;
Hurt by hurt,
You heal them all one hurt at a time.

Lord heal them all one hurt at a time.---Lyrics submitted by Tea Renthlei.
