On the night line

When I wake up in the morning, love
Sunlight hurts my eyes
Something without warning, love
Plays heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me

Oh just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be a lovely day
On the night line
For the night line

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me

Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be a lovely day
On the night line
For the night line---
