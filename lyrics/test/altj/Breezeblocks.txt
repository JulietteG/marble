She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Citrezene your fevers gripped me again
Never kisses all you ever send are fullstops - la la la la

Do you know where the wilds things go
They go along to take your honey - la la la la
Break down now weep build up breakfast now
Lets eat my love my love love love - la la la la

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah  ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah

Do you know where the wild things go
They go along to take your honey - la la la la
Break down lets sleep build up breakfast now
Lets eat my love my love love love - la la la la

She bruises coughs she splutters pistol shots
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Shes morphine queen of my vaccine my love my love love love - la la la la

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
And ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah  ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah  ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah

She may contain the urge to runaway
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germaline disinfect the scene my love my love love love
But please dont go I love you so my lovely
Please dont go, please dont go, I love you so, I love you so
Please dont go, please dont go, I love you so, I love you so
