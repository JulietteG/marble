Something good, oh something good, oh something good,
oh something good tonight make me forget about you for now

Get high, hit the floor before you go,
Matador, estocado, you're my blood sport

But something good, oh something good, oh something good,
oh something good tonight make me forget about you for now

Forty eight thousand seats bleats and roars for my memories of you,
Now that I'm fully clean, the matador is no more and is dragged from view

Get high, hit the floor before you go,
Matador, estocado, you're my blood sport,
Forty eight thousand seats bleats and roars for my memories of you,
Now that I am clean, the matador is no more, is dragged from view

But something good, oh something good, oh something good,
oh something good make me forget about you for now---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
