Hey girl Im waiting on ya, Im waiting on ya
Come on and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up the windows down

Yeah, well be doing what we do
Just pretending that were cool and we know it too
Yeah, well keep doing what we do
Just pretending that were cool, so tonight

Lets go crazy, crazy, crazy til we see the sun
I know we only met but lets pretend its love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight lets get some and live while were young
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh and live while were young
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tonight lets get some and live while were young

Hey girl its now or never, its now or never
Don't overthink just let it go
And if we get together, yeah get together
Dont let the pictures leave your phone

Yeah, well be doing what we do
Just pretending that were cool, so tonight

Lets go crazy, crazy, crazy til we see the sun
I know we only met but lets pretend its love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight lets get some and live while were young
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh and live while were young
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tonight lets get some and live while were young

And girl, you and I
Were about to make some memories tonight
I wanna live while were young
We wanna live while were young

Lets go crazy, crazy, crazy til we see the sun
I know we only met but lets pretend its love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight lets get some and live while were young

Crazy, crazy, crazy til we see the sun
I know we only met but lets pretend its love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight lets get some and live while were young

Wanna live, wanna live (wanna live while we're young)
C'mon, young
Wanna live, wanna live (wanna live while we're young)
Wanna live, wanna live (wanna live while we're young)
Tonight let's get some, and live while we're young ---Lyrics submitted by @1Direction-Chic.
