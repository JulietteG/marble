Am I asleep, am I awake, or somewhere in between?
I cant believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined?
Like branches on a tree, or twigs caught on a vine?

Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss
And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this,
Im just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world

Truly, madly, deeply, I am
Foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby, say youll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
In love with you

Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
And wake you up with all the words that I still havent said?
And tender touches, just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool like it was no big deal?

Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
Ill put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
Cause heres the tragic truth if you dont feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name

And truly, madly, deeply, I am
Foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby, say youll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you

I hope Im not a casualty,
I hope you wont get up and leave
May not mean that much to you
But to me its everything, everything

Truly, madly, deeply, I am
Foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby, say youll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy deeply in love (in love) with you (with you),
In love (in love) with you (with you)
In love (in love) with you (with you)
With you, oh! ---Lyrics submitted by Anneke van Keim.
