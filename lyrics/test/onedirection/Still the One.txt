Hello, hello, I know its been awhile but baby
I got something that I really wanna let you know, yeah
Something that I wanna let you know oh oh oh

You say you say that everybody that you hate me
Couldn't blame you cause I left you all alone, yeah
I know that I left you all alone

And yeah, now Im back at your door
You lookin at me Im sure
I shouldve seen it before
Youre all I think about, baby

I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know youre still the one
You might have moved on
But girl you should know
That I know youre still the one
I know its sayin too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know youre still the one
I know youre still the one

Hello, hello, Im really hoping youll forgive me
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I wanna hear, yeah
Girl just tell me what I wanna hear

I tried, I tried to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the time and all the words we said, yeah
i cant get it out of my head yeah

Now Im back at your door
You lookin at me Im sure
I shouldve seen it before
Youre all I think about, baby

I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know youre still the one
You might have moved on
But girl you should know
That I know youre still the one
I know its sayin too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know youre still the one

Hey you, youre still the one
Hey you, youre still the one
Hey you, youre still the one
Hey you, youre still the one

I know its sayin too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know youre still the one
I know youre still the one---Lyrics submitted by VASHAPPNIN.
