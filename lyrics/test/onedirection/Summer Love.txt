Zayn:
Can't believe you're packing your bags.
Tryin' so hard not to cry
Had the best time, and now its the worst time.
But we have to say goodbye

Harry:
Don't promise that you're gonna write
Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

Chorus (Niall):
Cuz you were mine for the summer, now we know its nearly over
Feels like snow in September, but I always will remember
You were my summer love 
You always will be my summer love

Louis:
Wish that we could be alone now
We could find someplace to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind

Liam:
Don't say the word thats on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember when the sky is gray

Chorus (Niall):
Cuz you were mine for the summer, now we know its nearly over
Feels like snow in September, but I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

Zayn:
So please don't make this any harder
We can't take this any farther
And I know there's nothing that I wanna change
Change

Chorus (Niall):
You were mine for the summer, now we know its nearly over
Feels like snow in September, but I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love
You always will be my summer love
You always will be my summer love---Lyrics submitted by Megan Shauny.
