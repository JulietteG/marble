ZAYN: 
Your hand fits in mine, like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind
it was meant to be
And I'm joining up dots with the freckles on your cheeks 
And it all makes sense to me 

LIAM:
I know you've never loved 
The crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine 
But I'll love them endlessly 

ZAYN & LIAM 
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do 
It's you, oh it's you 
They add up to 
I'm in love with you
And all these little things

LOUIS: 
You can't go to bed
Without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep 
Though it makes no sense to me

HARRY:
 I knowed you've never loved
The sound of your voice on tape
You've never want to know how much you weigh 
You still love to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

HARRY & NIALL:
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true 
It's you 
It's you they add up to 
I'm in love with you 
And all these little things

NIALL: 
You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right, darlin' but I want you to
If I let you know I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you
Oh

HARRY:
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
Cause it's you 
Oh it's you 
It's you they add up to 
And I'm in love with you 
And all these little things

ALL: 
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true 
It's you 
It's you they add up to 
I'm in love with you 
And all your little things---Lyrics submitted by grace.
