Hey hey
Oh no no no

Her laugh is as loud as is many ambulances
Is as it takes to save a savior oh
Whoa whoa whoa

She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say shes such a fake
That her love is made up, no
No no no

Lets have another toast to the girl almighty
Lets pray we stay young, stay made of lightning

Am I the only, only believer?
Theres something happening here
Theres something happening here
The only, only believer!
Theres something happening here
I hope you feel what Im feeling too

Id get down, Id get down
Id get down on my knees for you
Id get down, Id get down
Id get down on my knees
Id get down on my knees for you

Her light is as loud as is many ambulances
Is as it takes to save a savior oh
Whoa whoa whoa

She floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say shes such a fake
That her love is made up, no
No no no

Lets have another toast to the girl almighty
Lets pray we stay young, stay made of lightning

Am I the only, only believer?
Theres something happening here
Theres something happening here
The only, only believer!
Theres something happening here
I hope you feel what Im feeling too

Id get down, Id get down
Id get down on my knees for you
Id get down, Id get down
Id get down on my knees
Id get down on my knees for you---Lyrics submitted by Alice Smith.
