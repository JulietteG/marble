Her name is Noel
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour

Oh how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And se desn't give a damn about me

{Chorus}
Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
I'm just a teenage dirtbag
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, dirtbag!
No, she doesn't know what she's missing!
Oh, yeah, dirtbag!
No, she doesn't know what she's missing!

Man I feel like mold.
It's prom and I am lonely.
Lo and behold
She's walking over to me.

This must be fate
My lips start to shake.
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me?

I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby.
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe.
I'm just a teenage dirtbag like you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, dirtbag!
No, she doesn't know what she's missing!
Oh, yeah, dirtbag!
No, she doesn't know what she's missing.
Yeah, yeah!---Lyrics submitted by Hannah McBride.
