Im like a crow on a wire
Youre the shining distraction that makes me fly, oh
Im like a boat on the water
Youre the rays on the waves that calm my mind
Oh, every time

But I know in my heart, youre not a constant star

And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But Im not done yet, falling for your fools gold
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I dont regret falling for your fools gold

Im the first to admit that Im reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I cant see
Two feet in front of me

And I know in my heart, youre just a moving part

And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But Im not done yet, falling for your fools gold
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I dont regret falling for your fools gold

Yeah, I know your loves not real
Thats not the way it feels
Thats not the way you feel

And yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met
But Im not done yet, falling for your fools gold
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met
But I dont regret falling for your fools gold---
