I think Im gonna lose my mind
Something deep inside me, I cant give up
I think Im gonna lose my mind
I roll and I roll till Im out of luck
Yeah I roll and I roll till Im out of luck

Im feeling something deep inside
Hotter than a dead stream burning up
I got a feeling deep inside
Its taking, its taking, all Ive got
Yeah Its taking, its taking, all Ive got

Cause nobody knows you baby the way I do
And nobody loves you baby the way I do
Its been so long, its been so long
Maybe you were fireproof
Cause nobody saves me baby the way you do

I think Im gonna win this time
Riding on the wind and I wont give up
I think Im gonna win this time
I roll and I roll till it change my luck
Yeah I roll and I roll till it change my luck

Cause nobody knows you baby the way I do
And nobody loves you baby the way I do
Its been so long, its been so long
You must be fireproof
Cause nobody saves me baby the way you do

Cause nobody knows you baby the way I do
And nobody loves you baby the way I do
Its been so long, its been so long
Maybe you are fireproof
Cause nobody saves me baby the way you do---
