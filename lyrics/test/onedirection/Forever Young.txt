Let's dance in style,
 Let's dance for a while,
 Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies,
 Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
 Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever,
 We don't have the power but we never say never,
 Sitting in a sandpit,
 Life is a short trip,
 The music's for the sad man.

Forever young, 
I wanna be,
 Forever young,
 Do you really want to live forever,
 Forever,
 Forever young.

Some are like water, some are like the heat,
 Some are a melody of some other beat,
 But sooner or later they all will be gone,
 Why don't they stay young?

It's hard to get old without a cause,
 I don't want to perish like a fading horse,
 Youth is like diamonds in the sun,
 And diamonds are forever.

Forever young, 
I wanna be,
 Forever young,
 Do you really want to live forever,
 Forever,
 Or never?

Forever young, 
I wanna be,
 Forever young (forever),
 Do you really want to live forever,
 Forever,
 Or never?

So many adventures couldn't happen today,
 So many songs we forgot to play,
 So many dreams are swinging out of the blue,
 We let 'em come true.

Forever young, 
I wanna be,
 Forever young,
 Do you really want to live forever,
 Forever,
 Or never?

Forever young, 
I wanna be,
 Forever young Do you really want to live forever,
 Forever,
 Or never?

Forever young, 
I wanna be,
 Forever young (forever),
 Do you really want to live forever,
 Forever,
 Or never?

Forever young, 
I wanna be,
 Forever young (forever),
 Do you really want to live forever (forever),
 Forever (forever),
 Forever young...---Lyrics submitted by Holleigh Baker 15.
