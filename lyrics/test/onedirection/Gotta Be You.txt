Girl I see it in your eyes youre disappointed
Cause Im the foolish one that you anointed with your heart
I tore it apart
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence
And no woman in the world deserves this
But here I am asking you for one more chance

Can we fall, one more time?
Stop the tape and rewind
Oh and if you walk away I know Ill fade
Cause there is nobody else

Its gotta be you
Only you
Its gotta be you
Only you

Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles
When you speak to me I dont resemble, who I was
Youve almost had enough
And your actions speak louder than words
And youre about to break from all youve heard
Dont be scared, I aint going no where

Ill be here, by your side
No more fears, no more crying
But if you walk away
I know Ill fade
Cause there is nobody else

Its gotta be you
Only you
Its gotta be you
Only you

Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more time
Ill make it better
One more, one more, can we try?
One more, one more,
Can we try one more time to make it all better?

Cos its gotta be you
Its gotta be you
Only you
Only you

Its gotta be you
Only you
Its gotta be you
Only you---Lyrics submitted by elisa.
