I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I dont want to feel alone

So kiss me where I lay down, my hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved, to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18

We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew wed be fine

So pour me a drink
Oh love, lets split the night wide open and well see everything
We can live in love in slow motion, motion, motion

So kiss me where I lay down, my hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms are made for holding you, ooh
And I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
When we were 18
Oh lord, when we were 18

Kiss me where I lay down, my hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were 18
I want a love like you made me feel
When we were 18---
