Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesnt like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, shes showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She' heading for something that she wont forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older baby
And Ive been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that youve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But theres nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Chasing her tonight, doubts are running round her head
Hes waiting, hides behind his cigarette
Heart is beating loud, she doesnt want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
Shes falling, doesnt even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older baby
And Ive been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that youve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But theres nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesnt like that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost

We're only getting older baby
And Ive been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
Everything that youve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But theres nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you---Lyrics submitted by Jaityn Jackson.
