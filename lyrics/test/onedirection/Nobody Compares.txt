(Niall)You're so pretty when you cry, 
When you cry
Wasn't ready to hear you say goodbye
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart

(Zayn)You're so London, your own style, 
Your own style
And together you're so good
So, girl, why you tearing me apart, tearing me apart?
Tearing me apart

(Harry)Did I do something stupid?
Yea, girl if I blew it
Just tell me what I did
Let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me
Like before

Chorus:
Cuz no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts because
I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do
When you smile, baby tell me
How to make it right
Now all of my friends say
It's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could smile
Me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
(Harry) Cuz nobody compares to you

(Louis) We're so Paris when we kiss,
When we kiss
I remember the taste of your lipstick
Now you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart
You're tearing up my heart

(Harry) Did I do something stupid?
Yea, girl if I blew it
Just tell me what I did
Let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me
Like before

Chorus:
Cuz no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts because
I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do
When you smile, baby tell me
How to make it right
Now all of my friends say
It's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could smile
Me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you

(Harry) Nobody compares to you

(Niall) There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me
Like before

Chorus:
Cuz no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts because
I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do
When you smile, baby tell me
How to make it right
Now all of my friends say
It's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could smile
Me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you---Lyrics submitted by hi.
