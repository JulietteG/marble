Me Ire (The Hardest Day)

One more day, one last look
Before I leave it all behind
And play the role that's meant for us
That said we'd say goodbye

cuentame otra vez
si no es el mismo el sol de ayer el que se esconde hoy
para ti para mi para nadie mas se ha inventado el mar

If I promise to believe will you believe
That there's nowhere that we'd rather be
Nowhere describes where we are
Ive no choice, I love you leave,
Love you wave goodbye

And all I ever wanted was to stay
And nothing in this worlds gonna change, change

Never wanna wake up from this night
Never wanna leave this moment
Waiting for you only, only you
Never gonna forget every single thing you do
When loving you is my finest hour
Leaving you, the hardest day of my life
The hardest day of my life

Dejame que te de cada segundo
envuelto en un atardecer de vida
para ti para mi para nadie mas se ha inventado el mar

But I never will regret a single day
Y ninguno sabia muy bien que hacer
What I'm feeling for you
aquella noche noche
I will always love you leave,
Love you wave goodbye

ieieiei este, and all I ever wanted was to stay
maldito atardecer
Nothing in this world's gonna change...

Never wanna wake up from this night
Never wanna leave this moment
Waiting for you only, only you
Never gonna forget every single thing you do
When loving you is my finest hour
I never knew I'd ever feel this way
I feel for you...

Never wanna wake up, I feel for you, from this night
Never wanna leave this moment
Wainting for you only, only you
Never gonna forget every single thing you do
When loving you is my finest hour
Leaving you, the hardest day of my life...
Never wanna wake up from this night...---Lyrics submitted by lisa.
