Driving home in my car, nearly midnight
Rain on the road in my view
Holes in my heart, its the first night without you
On my clothes I still smell your perfume

Should I call?
When I left you were crying
Is it too late to apologise
From talking to fighting, admitting, denying
To finally saying goodbye

Now I regret every word that was spoken
I said some things you know I didnt mean
Maybe well turn back the time
Work it out, start anew
Or maybe today Ive lost you

I cant help but think of our last conversation
I close my eyes I can still see your face
I hope what Im feeling now
You are feeling it too
Or maybe today Ive lost you

Driving faster out on this empty road
Being singles so bad at twenty-three
Looking for signs, asking strangers directions
When the answers right in front of me

Strange how a day it can feel like a lifetime
I know what I had now its gone
Ive swallowed my pride cos alone here, Im dying
And with you is where I belong

For twenty-four hours Ive been searching for reasons
Reasons why we should be living apart
Hope Im not too late to come home
Work it out, start anew
Or maybe today Ive lost you

Maybe today, Ive lost you
Maybe today, Ive lost you---Lyrics submitted by Melanie.
