Oh there are people here
So many people here looking back at me
Feel the energy
Oh they call my name
Oh they call my name its the loudest noise
And its all for me

Yeah its all for me
Yeah when its all for me
I can get away to a better place
Hey Im looking down
Yeah Im looking down
I can see you now
Are you coming out

Theres a voice in my head
And its talking again
Out of time, out of space
Its a feeling a meaning that I can taste

I dont know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I dont know why people give but Ill take it (Ill take it), Ill take it (Ill take it)

(Hey!)

Hey, Im back again
Yeah Im back again in another place
I can see your face
Oh let me hear you now, yeah let me hear you now
Let me hear you loud, make a bigger sound

Theres a voice in my ear
The intention is clear
Out of time, out of space
Its a feeling a meaning that I can taste

I dont know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I dont know why people give but Ill take it (Ill take it), Ill take it (Ill take it)

[x4:]
Everybodys looking for
Someone that they can adore
Give them what they came here for
Always leave them wanting more

I dont know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I dont know why people give but Ill take it (Ill take it), Ill take it (Ill take it)

I dont know what people see but I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
I dont know why people give but Ill take it (Ill take it), Ill take it (Ill take it)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
