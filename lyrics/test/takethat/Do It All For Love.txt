Give me your hurt if you need someone to blame
Give me your call if you need someone to save
Ill take the salt and all the weight of your tears
All of your fears Im gonna take them away
Take them away

For all your days inspired
By the beauty of your timing
And those endless acts of kindness

I want to give you more, give you more
I only want to let you know
I will be here for you, here for you
How far can we go

Till the last of the daylight survives
We do it all for love
While we wait for the dawn to arrive
We do it all for love

I do it for you and all the people we meet
People like us, people like me
I do it for you because its all that I know
All that I see and all that I saw

I hope we will recover
And return to be discovered

I want to give you more, give you more
I only want to let you know
I will be here for you, here for you
How far can we go

Till the last of the daylight survives
We do it all for love
While we wait for the dawn to arrive
We do it all for love 
Till the last of the daylight survives
We do it all for love
While we wait for the dawn to arrive
We do it all for love 
Till the last of the daylight survives
We do it all for love
While we wait for the dawn to arrive
We do it all for love---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
