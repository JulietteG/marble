ahh, baby, mmm

The moonlight, The music and You
Lover, I'm yearning for you
Would you give me a sign?

After dark will you be mine? (After Dark)
After dark your light will shine (After Dark)
Love is such a wonderful vine,
It's high upon to me, one of a kind

After dark you're gonna be mine (After Dark)
After dark your light will shine (After Dark)
Moonlight and you, baby
The music is you

The night is falling, now
and the moonlight is shining near,
Baby, you and me

After dark we'll dream again (After Dark)
After dark there'll be no end (After Dark)
Through this magic wonderland,
fall in love with me again

Oh, after dark my dreams come true (After Dark)
After dark I'll be with you (After Dark)
oh, Moonlight and you, baby
The music is you, ah-ah-ah-ah

Oh baby, Can't you feel me burnin'
oh, how I long for you

oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

After dark we'll feel desire (After Dark)
After dark we'll feel the fire (After Dark)
Moonlight and you, baby
The music is you, Ooh!

[instrumental]

Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

After dark,
Don't you know you can 
touch me and you'll see,
Ah, ah, ah

After Dark Baby,
Ooh, we'll be together
just the moonlight and you

Oh, you're gonna be mine
Let it shine on through
Moonlight and You baby,
Oh, baby

After dark, touch me and you
Take me through this magic wonderland,
baby
Ah, hah, ah, Ooh, Ooh
Oh baby, the music and you

ooooh....
