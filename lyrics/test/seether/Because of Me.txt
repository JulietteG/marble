Yeah.....

Here She comes again, Shes feeling like shes already won
I believe its gonna end again, all for naught.
My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem,
I believe its gonna end this way, atrocity.

Do you believe in love, Like i believe in pain?
Nobody died for you, somebody pray for me!

When you see me cut me down,
 and I will force it underground,
Theres no one left to hurt but me,
And its because of me, Right?

There he walks away hes feeling like hes having them on,
I believe hes gonna bend again And all for naught.
My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem, 
Gotta get you off of my mind, an oddity.

Do you believe in love like i believe in pain?
Nobody died for you, somebody pray for me!

When you see me  cut me down
And I will force it underground, 
Theres no one left to hurt but me,
And its because of me, right?

I wont just see you suffer! Suffer!

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground, 
Theres no one left to hurt but me,
And its because of me, right?

When you see me cut me down,
And when you see me cut me down, 
And when you see me cut me down, 
And Its because of me. Suffer!---Lyrics submitted by Dennis.
