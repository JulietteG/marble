All I really want is something beautiful to say
All I really want is something beautiful to say

Keep me locked up in your broken mind
I keep searching
Never been able to find a light behind your dead eyes
Not anything at all
You keep living in your own lie
Ever deceitful and ever unfaithful
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified
Take everything from my world

I say can you help me right before the fall?
Take what you can and leave me to the wolves

Keep me dumb, keep me paralyzed
Why try swimming? I'm drowning in fable
You're not that saint that you externalize
You're not anything at all
It's all so playful when you demonize
To spit out the hateful, you're willing and able
You're words are weapons of the terrified
You're nothing in my world

I say can you help me right before the fall?
Take what you can and leave me to the wolves

All I really want is something beautiful to say
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified
All I really want is something beautiful to say
You keep living in your own lie
All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away, I wanna live forever
All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away, I wanna live forever
You keep living in your own lie
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified
All I really want is something beautiful to say

I say can you help me right before the fall?
Take what you can and leave me to the wolves

All I really want is something beautiful to say
Words are weapons of the terrified
All I really want is something beautiful to say
Keep me guessing, keep me terrified
All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away, I wanna live forever
All I really want is something beautiful to say
To never fade away, I wanna live forever---
