Before you hedge those bets you placed againts me
Be renascent of fortunes they foretell
You'r verbal defecation i cant wash away despite myself,your vanity it seems has served you well.

You'r so quick to choose the path walked by the righteous
So you can go and nest amont the weak
The innocent observers will refuse to find the lie within
Renew the disappointment of the meak

YOU'RE NO JESUS CHRIST

YOU'RE NO JESUS CHRIST

Put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger
I feel so alive,here
Put the gun in my mouth it taste so bitter
I feel so alive here

YOU'RE NO JESUS CHRIST

YOU'RE NO JESUS CHRIST

You keep taking over,i keep rolling over
i cant take it anymore
You keep taking over,i keep rolling over
i cant take it anymore

Before you hedge those bets you placed against me
Be renascent of fortunes they foretell
You verbal defecation i cant wash away despite myself,you're vanity it seems has served you well

You keep taking over,i keep rolling over
I can't take it anymore
You keep taking over,i keep rolling over
I can't take it anymore

You keep taking over,i keep rolling over
I can't take it anymore
You keep takin gover,i keep rolling over
I can't take it anymore---Lyrics submitted by joe.
