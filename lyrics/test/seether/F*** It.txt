I guess I like it when we play 
(The way you drag me down)
I guess I like it when you hate me 
(The way you drag me down)
Cause I cant face myself in a mirror 
(Im left alone with all my pain) 
And I disgrace myself in the mirror
(Im left alone with my shame) 

Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! Ill heal you in me
Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! Ill heal you in me

I guess I like it when we fight 
(The way you drag me down)
I guess I like it when you smite me 
(The way you drag me down)
Cause I cant face myself in a mirror 
(Im left alone with all my pain) 
And I disgrace myself in the mirror 
(Im left alone with my shame)

Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! Ill heal you in me
Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! Ill heal you in me

Youre out of luck - cant get a piece of me
Its all blown up. Dont even fuck with me.
I cannot please you all forever
I cannot please you at all
(I can feel you coming up behind me)

Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! Ill heal you in me
Fuck it! I see you in me
Fuck it! I feel you in me
Fuck it! Ill heal you in me---
