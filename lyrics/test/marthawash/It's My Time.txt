I can see it clear
Im getting close
Im almost there
Its indescribable
Its my time to shine
Its my time

We all have dreams
We all have goals
With laughter and tears,
Thats what were living for
Its my time to shine
Its my time

Keep on walking your own path
Never let anyone hold you back
When you feel like giving in,
You get right up and try again and again

Be who you are
And you will go far
Theres a place for everyone to be a star
Its my time to shine
Its my time

Keep on walking your own path
Never let anyone hold you back
When you feel like giving in,
You get right up and try again and again
Its my time (ohhh!)
Its my time (yes it is)
Its my time (ohhh!)
Its my time (yeah!)

I can see it clear
Im getting close
Im almost there
Its indescribable
Its my time to shine
Its my time

Keep on walking your own path
Never let anyone hold you back
When you feel like giving in,
You get right up and try again and again
Its my time 
My time 
Its my time 
My time
