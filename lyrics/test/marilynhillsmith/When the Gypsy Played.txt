Weave your spell, soft melody of gypsy strings.
Fill my heart with music like the fluttering of wings.
The evening star, your song to hear, renews his dying fire.
My lonely heart finds hope again and burns with an old desire.

Wild and free as the cold gypsy hills,
hills of the home for which I yearn,
sound your rhapsodies, oh, bold gypsy boy,
'til my wandering feet ree-ee-turn.

Trees, ...in ev'ry leaf, began to sing
and winter blossomed like the spring
and lovers, by a song betrayed,
forgot their heavy sighing.

Birds... of ev'ry colour, unafraid,
from all the four winds flying,
gathered around to hear when the gypsy played.

~#~#~

Birds of ev'ry colour, unafraid,
from all the four winds flying,
gathered around to hear when the gypsy played.

Sweep your strings with your moon-guided hand,
bold lonely minstrel of the dark sighing pines.
I cah-an hear you from the ends of the world
and my sails are leaning straight t'ward your gy-y-ypsy land!

~#~#~

Birds... of ev'ry colour, unafraid,
from all the four winds flying,
gathered around to hear when the gypsy played.
