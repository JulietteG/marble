Here we are in this big old empty room, staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you, let's stop fooling around
Take me baby... kiss me all over... play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of
Do Me Baby, like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Do Me Baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait... 

Here we are looking for a reason for you to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season, so baby please stop teasing me
What ya do, I can never love no other, u're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another, I just want you so bad

So Do Me Baby, like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
C'mon, Do Me Baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more

I said ooo... ooo... oooo... ooooooo
Do Me Baby, Do Me Baby, give it to me
Do Me Baby, I want you now
Do Me Baby, give it to me
Do Me Baby, Do Me baby, don't wanna do it all alone
I want your love.
Do Me Baby, give it to me
Do Me Baby, This feeling is too strong, make me wait 2 long, I want you now

You're leaving me no choice
OK, what are you gonna do... u just gonna sit there and watch? alright... 
Are you sure you don't wanna close your eyes?
... well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?
I'm not gonna stop till the war is over... 
Help me! there... ok... ok
I'm so cold... just hold me---Lyrics submitted by GWENETTA.
