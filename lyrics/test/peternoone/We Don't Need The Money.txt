when we were kids in the playground
without a penny to lay down,
it never mattered to me and you.

remember jenny and johnnie,
whose dad had plenty of money,
they used to quarrel the whole day through.

you and me, we never had a penny,
never had and never wanted any,
we don't need the money, honey,
we got love.

can it make the sunshine any brighter?
can it make the heartbeat any lighter?
we don't need the money, honey,
we got love.

babe, loving you
i don't need the things that other people do.
i've never been a man for wheeling and dealing
no amount of money could give me this feeling.

i'd buy a kiss from you, honey,
but i don't have any money,
i guess i'd better have one for free.

you and me, we never had a penny,
never had and never wanted any,
we don't need the money, honey,
we got love.

ohhh, bababdadada,
ohhh, bababdadada,
ohhh, we got love.

we don't need the money, honey, honey,
we don't need the money, honey, honey,
we don't need the money, honey,
we got love.---Lyrics submitted by Bastian Fischer.
