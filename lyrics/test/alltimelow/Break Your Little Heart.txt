Wide awake, my mistake so predictable
You were fake, I was great nothing personal

I'm walking, who's laughing now?
(Who's laughing, who's laughing now?)
I'm wasted, wasting time
You talk for hours but you're wasting lines
A pretty face but the chase ain't worth the prize

I'm gonna break your little heart
Watch you take the fall
Laughing all the way to the hospital
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
When I break your little heart in two
I'm gonna break your little heart in two

Party queen, cause a scene so ridiculous
Little dress, maybe less so conspicuous

You're falling, who's crashing now?
(Who's crashing, who's crashing now?)
I'm wasted, wasting time
I'm moving on but you're left behind
A pretty face but the chase ain't worth the prize

I'm gonna break your little heart
Watch you take the fall
Laughing all the way to the hospital
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
I'm gonna break your little heart
Show you to the door sew yourself shut
Now you're begging for more
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
When I break your little heart in two

Don't be so sentimental, no
This love was accidental, so
Give it up, this was never meant to be more than a memory for you

I'm gonna break your little heart
Watch you take the fall
Laughing all the way to the hospital
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
(When I break your little heart in two)
I'm gonna break your little heart
Show you to the door sew yourself shut
Now you're begging for more
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
When I break your little heart in two ---Lyrics submitted by Gabriella.
