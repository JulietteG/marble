It's a long way home
When you're on your own
And your only friends are traffic lights
Speaking in Morse code
Yeah, the road is long
And I am tired
But you are my horizon
I will drive until it all breaks down

Cause I can't breathe without you near
You keep me safe, keep me sane
Keep me honest

You keep me alive
On the edge of tonight
Chasing tomorrow
With fire in my eyes, yeah
You're like a sunray in the dark
You're the beat playing in my heart
Keep me alive
On the edge of tonight, yeah

Spend my whole damn life
Trying to get things right
And for everyone, my mistakes
You gave me all these chances
But the road's too long
And I am tired
But you are my horizon
I will drive until it all breaks down

You keep me alive
On the edge of tonight
Chasing tomorrow
With fire in my eyes, yeah
You're like a sunray in the dark
You're the beat playing in my heart
Keep me alive
On the edge of tonight, yeah

You keep me safe
You keep me sane
You keep me honest, honest, honest, oh woah
You keep me safe
You keep me sane
You keep me honest

You keep me alive
On the edge of tonight
Chasing tomorrow
With fire in my eyes, yeah
You're like a sunray in the dark
You're the beat playing in my heart
Keep me alive
On the edge of tonight, yeah

We're on the edge of tonight
Edge of tonight
Keep me safe
You keep me sane
You keep me honest, honest, honest (standing on the edge of tonight)
On the edge of tonight
On the edge of tonight
On the edge of tonight---
