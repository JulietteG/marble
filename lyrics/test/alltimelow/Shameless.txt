Hips sway and lips lie
Like clockwork, she's in control
Of all the right guys
And I'm still waiting

Fitted hats and a car alarm
Wears high-tops with her favorite stone
She's showing off the way she walks
It's on

Take me, show me
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
The corners of your empty room
The trouble we could get in to
Just fake it for me
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
Disregard the footsteps
And we'll never tell a soul

Tonight I'm finding a way
To make the things that you say
Just a little less obvious

I walk a fine line
Between the right and the real
They watch me closely
But talk is cheap here

Like a weightless currency
Your words don't mean shit to me
I'm always cashing out

Take me, show me
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
The corners of your empty room
The trouble we could get in to
Just fake it for me
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
Disregard the footsteps
And we'll never tell a soul

Tonight I'm finding a way
To make the things that you say
Just a little less obvious
I confess
Tonight I'm dressed up in gold
You've got me fucked up and so
You talk like you're famous
You're shameless

Tonight I'm finding a way
To make the things that you say
Just a little less obvious
I confess
Tonight I'm dressed up and go
You've got me fucked up and so
You talk like you're famous
You're shameless

Tonight I'm finding a way
To make the things that you say
Just a little less obvious
I confess
Tonight I'm dressed up and go
You've got me fucked up and so
You talk like you're famous
You're shameless---Lyrics submitted by Stephanie.
