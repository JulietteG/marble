When will the princess figure out she ain't worth saving
Heavy the head that bears the crown
Of my mistaken apathy for sympathy

I was never good enough to be anything but remedy
To all of your constant pressing needs
And I never learned, so

I painted a picture of the things I wanted most
To color in the darker side of all my brightest hopes
But there's a monster standing where you should be
So I'll paint you wings (I'll paint you wings)
Now I'll set you free (I'll set you free)

I was a pawn in all of your plans, you kept me busy
Locked behind your chamber doors when you felt frisky
Until you got sick of me

I was never good enough to be anything but remedy
To all of your constant pressing needs
And I never learned, so

I painted a picture of the things I wanted most
To color in the darker side of all my brightest hopes
But there's a monster standing where you should be
So I'll paint you wings (I'll paint you wings)
Now I'll set you free (I'll set you free)

When will the princess figure it out, she ain't worth saving
And when will the world get over all her misbehaving
Will we ever learn?

I painted a picture of the things I wanted most
To color in the darker side of all my brightest hopes
But there's a monster standing where you should be
So I'll paint you wings (I''l paint you wings)
Now I'll set you free (I'll set you free)

(So she can fly away)

I painted a picture of the things I wanted most
To color in the darker side of all my brightest hopes
But there's a monster standing where you should be
So I'll paint you wings (I'll paint you wings)
Now I'll set you free (I'll set you free)

(So you can fly away)---Lyrics submitted by Kaitlin Burke.
