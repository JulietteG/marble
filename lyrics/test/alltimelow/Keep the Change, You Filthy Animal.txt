Are you having trouble
Finding sleep at night?
Or does your lack of conscious tell you
Everything's alright

I trust your good intentions
That your watching over friends
You must think that I'm crazy
If I don't see that plan

So tell me what your best friend knows
That I don't know
Tell me why you talk me down
Wherever you go
You're a saint, you're a queen
And I'm just another boy without a crown
Tell me why you sell me out everywhere you go
I just wanna know
What your best friend knows(what your best friend knows)

So vindictive
You'll say anything you like
The smile you fake, the steps you take
You know you never could get it right

And talk is cheap
So make believe your secrets fine and safe
It's too late, you gave up
Your last chance to walk away

So tell me what your best friend knows
That I don't know
Tell me why you talk me down
Wherever you go
You're a saint, you're a queen
And I'm just another boy without a crown
Tell me why you sell me out everywhere you go
I just wanna know
What your best friend knows

Stand a little to tall
Say a little too much
Gonna bite that know-it-all tongue
You tried a little too hard
Now I'm calling that bluff
Big plans are coming undone

That's just typical
You're so cynical
Couldn't have me
I didn't want you
Sell me out to the girl you fought to lose

Stand a little to tall
Say a little too much
Gonna bite that know-it-all tongue
You tried a little too hard
Now I'm calling that bluff
Big plans are coming undone

That's just typical
You're so cynical
Couldn't have me
I didn't want you
You set yourself up to lose

So tell me what your best friend knows
That I don't know
Tell me why you talk me down
Wherever you go
You're a saint, you're a queen
And I'm just another boy without a crown
Tell me why you sell me out everywhere you go
I just wanna know
What your best friend knows

What your best friend knows
I'm never gonna let this go
What your best friend knows---
