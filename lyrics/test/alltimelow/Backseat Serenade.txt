(feat. Cassadee Pope of Hey Monday)

Lazy lover
Find a place for me again
You felt it once before
I know you did
I could see it

Whiskey Princess
Drink me under, pull me in
You had me at come over boy
I need a friend
I understand

Backseat serenade
Dizzy hurricane
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away
To your radio

Backseat serenade
Little hand grenade
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the pain away
To your radio

You take me over
I throw you up against the wall
We've seen it all before
But this one's different
It's deliberate

You send me reeling
Calling out to you for more
The value of this moment lives in metaphor
Yeah, through it all

Backseat serenade
Dizzy hurricane
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away
To your radio

Backseat serenade
Little hand grenade
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the pain away
To your radio

Backseat serenade
Dizzy hurricane
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away
To your radio

Backseat serenade
Little hand grenade
Oh, aren't you sick of sleeping alone?
We're salty on a summer day
Kiss the pain away
To your radio

(Oh god I'm sick of sleeping alone) ---
