Well your a long walk from the street
and Im dying in this summer heat
I hope like hell your waiting(waiting)

Everybodys livin like their crazy in love 
Im a dizzy mess and everything is so above me
from the floor to any life i lead today

Well they can take take take the kids from the summer
but theyll never ever ever take the summer from me
It was the very first time
I lost my mind for the week
They can make make make me forget the weather
but theyll never ever ever wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time we said goodbye to the beach
showin off showin off our teeth

So make one last call back home
Cause tonight were goinging alon
and I hope that you know im waiting (waiting)

Everybodys singin like theyre crazy in love 
made a dizzy mess off everything
and it was enought 
to bring all the boys and all the girls
Together

Well they can take take take the kids from the summer 
but theyll never ever ever take the summer from me
it was the very first time I lost my mind for the week
they can make make make me forget the weather
but theyll never ever ever wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time we said good bye to the beach
showin off showin off our teeth

Your going out in style 
and Im getting tired off
all your lying
stop pretending
stop
the answers in the smile
and im getting tired of 
all your lying
stop pretending

Well they can take take take the 
kids fromt the kids from the summer but theyll
never never ever take the summer from me
it was the very first time I lost my mind for the week
they can make make make me forget the weather 
if theyll never ever ever wash the sand from my feet
it was the very last time we said goodbye to the beach
showin off showin off our teeth---Lyrics submitted by lucky.
