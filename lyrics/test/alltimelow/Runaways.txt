Only a quitter would let it go
I'll be your fool and one man show
I was so bitter till you came along
You set my sails when the tide was low
We're going down this road
With tears in our rear-view mirror
Far from home, but in the dark you know
With me you've got nothing to fear

So let's run away
They will have to find another heart to break
Why don't we just run away
Never turn around, no matter what they say
We'll find a way
When the sun goes down on this town
There'll be no-one left but us
Just like runaways
They will have to find some other hearts to break
Hearts to break

Out in the distance
Lost in the fold
We trace our steps to a great unknown
Bury our toes where the ocean meets the sand
We hide ourselves right where we stand

They won't catch us in the dark
Roll like thunder, burn like stars---
