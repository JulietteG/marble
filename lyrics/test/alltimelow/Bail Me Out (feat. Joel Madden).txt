What can I say? I fucked this up again
What can I do? I took it out on you
I ran around, messed up everything
I made a big mistake and now I'm wondering

Would you bail me out if I needed?
Help me down, would you catch me when I fall?
Another night I'm out here wasted
Another night you gotta take my call
Would you bail me out?
Say, are you gonna take my call?

So listen up, I know I'm out of line
Just settle down, you know it's gonna be alright
Please, come around and get, get me out of here
Just take me far away, I really want to disappear

Don't stop, ready or not
It's such a long way away from the top
And I know that you'll be there to catch me
If I stumble down this road---
