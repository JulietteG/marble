time to lay claim to the evidence 
finger prints sold me out 
but our footprints wash away 
From the docks downtown 
and its been getting late for days 
and I think myself deserving of 
a little time off, 
we can kick it here for hours and 
just mouth off about the world 
and how we know its going straight to hell 
pass me another bottle honey, the Jaeger's so sweet 
but if it keeps you around, then Im down 

Meet me on Thames Street 
Ill take you out, though Im hardly worth your time 
In the cold you look so fierce but Im warm enough 
Because the tensions like a fire 
Well hit 
South Broadway in a matter of minutes 
And like a bad movie, Ill drop a line 
Fall in the grave Ive been digging myself, 
But theres room for two 
Six feet under the stars 

I should have known better than to call you out 
[on a night like this, a night like this] 
If not for you, I know Id tear this place to the ground 
[but Im alright like this, alright like this] 
Im gonna roll the dice before you sober up and get gone 
[Im always in over my head] 

Thames Street 
Ill take you out, though Im hardly worth your time 
In the cold you look so fierce but Im warm enough 

Because the tensions like a fire 
Well hit 
South Broadway in a matter of minutes 
And like a bad movie, Ill drop a line 
Fall in the grave Ive been digging myself, 
But theres room for two 
Six feet under the stars 

time to lay claim to the evidence 
finger prints sold me out 
but our foot prints washed away 
Im guilty but Im safe for one more day 
overdressed and underage 
[what a let down] 
do you really need to see an id? 
This is embarrassing as hell 
[what a let down] 
but i can cover for it so well 
When were six feet under the stars 

Thames Street 
Ill take you out, though Im hardly worth your time 
In the cold you look so fierce but Im warm enough 
Because the tensions like a fire 
Well hit 
South Broadway in a matter of minutes 
And like a bad movie, Ill drop a line 
Fall in the grave Ive been digging myself, 
But theres room for two 
Six feet under the stars 

whaaaoooooo whaaaoooooo whaaaooooo
Six feet under the stars 
whaaaoooooo whaaaoooooooooooooo
Six feet under the stars---Lyrics submitted by Peter.
