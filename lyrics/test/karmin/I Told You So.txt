Aye, aye, aye
Is it time, green light
Egotistic, battle cry
I was right, you was wrong
Called you out, finished strong
Whiskey sour lemonade, fences at my barricade
I had heart, you had spades
I could see the color in your face as it fades
That's how it is, ain't no riddle
Crunchy on the edge but soft in the middle
I got a lot, you got a little
I'ma play war drum, you play the fiddle
Play it real slow, lean on the bow
Everybody's sad when they miss a free throw
Lost your control, I'm on a roll
Right all along and I knew it in my soul.

I told you so
Don't want to brag but you already know (Oh)
I told you so
Don't want to brag but you already know.
You already know.

I told you, I told you, I told you so oh.
I told you, I told you, I told you so oh.

F-f-f-feels so good, doesn't it?
Winnin' while they flubbin' it.
I was right, you was wrong.
Figured I'd write it in a hip hop song.
Was it so hard to believe?
I can make it, being me?
Drank too much Ouzo.
My gosh, you know.
People say a lot of things, make you feel real small.
Push them out the way, iced latte, tall.
I don't really care, I'm not really there.
Caffeinated up to my eyes, I swear.
I'm on the top, you on the flop.
Going so long and I'm never gonna stop.
Lost your control, I'm on a roll
Right all along and I knew it in my soul.

I told you so
Don't want to brag but you already know (Oh)
I told you so
Don't want to brag but you already know.
You already know.

I told you, I told you, I told you so oh.
I told you, I told you, I told you so oh.

Look at me now, fifteen rounds.
Bottle in my hand, pour a little on the ground.
Next time you wanna talk trash, I'ma put it on blast
You can get it if you ask for it
Put it onna middle finger of the fat lady singin' out
Shatter up ya glass house. Oops. Ni hao.
Meanwhile, I smile.
Then I go, animal style.

I be rackin' up another million,
Making me another killin',
Superwoman earnin' top dollar billin',
Yeah I muster up a lot of feelings
Tell me what you really think about it
Kiddin', I don't even care.
Nobody listens to a fool's gold covered hater,
Be a baller not a traitor please
Had me on my knees
Talk to you later,
Na-na-na-na
Whoop, there it go!
Right all along and I knew it in my soul.

I told you so
Don't want to brag but you already know (Oh)
I told you so
Don't want to brag but you already know.
You already know.
[x2]

I told you, I told you, I told you so oh.
I told you, I told you, I told you so oh.---Lyrics submitted by Connor Akins.
