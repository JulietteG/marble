Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Lets go...
Yeah
You're listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fucking hits than a disciplined child
When they see me everybody brrrrrap's, brrrrrraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to earth
I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming till they hear you out

[chorus:]
Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tip cause we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say the money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out

[chorus:]
Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way [x2]---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Tiepa.
