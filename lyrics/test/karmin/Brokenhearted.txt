This is more than a typical kinda thing
Felt the joints in my bones when you were touching me,
Oh oh, didn't want to take it slow
In the days, going crazy, I can barely think
You're replaying in my brain, find it hard to sleep,
Oh oh, waiting for my phone to blow

Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a little trouble, yep, but now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
Don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour
Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go

See, I've been waiting all day
For you to call me, baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right

Honest baby, I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

What's the time, such a crime
Not a single word, slipping on at the thrown
Just to call my nerves, oh oh
Poppin' bottles by the phone
Oh yeah

Act me up, pat me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, call me up
Maybe I'm in doubt, oh oh
And I don't even think you know, no no

See, I've been waiting all day
For you to call me, baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right

Honest baby, I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you say, it's like a gold with a view
Business on the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack
This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it so come and get it

Cheerio
See, I've been waiting on this
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight

Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

When you gonna call
Don't leave me broken hearted
I've been waiting up
Let's finish what we started, oh oh
I can't seem to let you go
Come on, that's right, cheerio---
