I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like,
Forget you!
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like,
Forget you!
And forget her too!

Yeah baby I'm sorry, i can't afford a Ferrari,
But that don't mean i can't get you there.
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari,
But the way you play your game ain't fair.
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(oh she's a gold digger)
Well, just thought you should know
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like,
Forget you!
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like,
Forget you!
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some sh*t?
(Ain't that some sh*t?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a...
Forget you!

Now I know, that I had to borrow,
Beg and steal and lie and cheat.
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya.
'Cause being in love with you ass ain't cheap.
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(oh she's a gold digger)
Well just thought you should kno
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little girlfriend

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like,
Forget you!
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like,
Forget you!
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some sh*t?
(Ain't that some sh*t?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a...
Forget you!

Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(so bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my mamma but she told me
"this is one for your dad"
(your dad, your dad, your dad)
Uh! Why? Uh! Why? Uh!
Why lady? Oh! I love you oh!
I still love you, Oooh!
I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like,
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo

I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like,
Forget you!
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some sh*t?
(Ain't that some sh*t?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a...
