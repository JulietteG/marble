When you find you can't go on,
Worrying 'bout what you have.

Call on me and if I'm free,
I'll try and add up the amount.

Don't you think I won't be fair?
I can see you're on the brink of despair.

I'm gonna help you all I can,
With a few more things than the average man.

I'll try to itemize all your bills,
Try to cure all you ills.

But, please don't ask too much of me.

Yesterday you called said, "Will you see me through?"
I said, "Sure, my friend, I'd love to help 'cause I'm watching after you."

Whatever it is you may need be it large or be it small,
There's nothing I won't do if you'll only call me.

Come and tell me 'bout your plans, all about your dreams.
I'll try and organize your thoughts and turn rivers into streams.

And if I go to fast for you, stop me for awhile.
'Cause all I want now in return is just to see you smile.

(Bridge)...

And now it seems so long ago,
That you were lost - just a part of the show.

But then again, we may never know.
As the old winds fly past our eyes we feel the new winds blow.

Please believe me when I tell you that these are brand new days.
All our plans are working well.  You could say we're through the pain.

And if you don't believe that all of this is real,
Come and take a look in the books and you'll see I cannot steal.---Lyrics submitted by Randy Dean.
