All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more in to laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Everybody just wants to go back home

I myself have seen my wilder days
And I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
Nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

Yeah, I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And old George Jones I'm glad to see is finally getting straight
And Waylon's staying home and loving Jessie more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

SOLO

And hangovers hurt more than they used to
And cornbread and ice tea took the place of pills and 90 proof
And it seems like none of use do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

Yeah, I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68'
And Chris he is a movie star and he's moved off to L.A.
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
Yeah, me and my rowdy friends done rowdied on down---Lyrics submitted by brian.
