I'm just a singer
Natural born guitar ringer.
Kind of a clinger to sad old songs.
I'm not a walk behind em', I'm a new note finder.
But my name's a reminder of a blue's man that's already gone.

So I started drinkin' . 
Took things that messed with my thinkin'
I was sure sinkin' when you came along.
I was alone in the hot life 
Not too much left in sight.
But she changed all that in one night
When she sang me this song

Hey Baby, I love you
Hey Baby, I need you
Hey Baby, you don't have to prove to me
You're some kind of macho man.
You've wasted so much of your life
Runin' thru the dark nights
Let me shine some love light
Down on the Blue's Man.

I got so sick from speedin'
All the stuff they said I was needin'
If I was to keep pleasin' all of my fans.
I got cuffed on dirt road
I got sued over no-show's
But she came and took all that old load
Down off this Blue's Man.

Hey Baby, I love you too
Hey Baby, I need you.
Hey Baby, I do get tired of this traveling band.
I'm thirty years old now, nights would be cold now
If you hadn't stuck it out with this Blue's Man.

I'm thirty years old now sure would be cold now
If you hadn't hung around with this Blue's Man.---Lyrics submitted by Missy.
