I mean this, I'm not sure if you could say the same.
Week after week after week
Idolatry is wasted reverence, idolatry is the yellow on your teeth.
Gasp for the truth you once lived.
Beyond this world is what is always breathing,
Beyond this world is worth dying for.
I remember what you used to claim,
you can't bury conviction with anything.
Our message will grow, 
no matter the mistakes made within construction.
Beyond this world is what is always breathing,
beyond this world is worth dying for.
Gasp for the truth you once lived.
I pray that the stolen glimpses do not subtract from what we've been building.
Keep stride persist in our march.---Lyrics submitted by makenna.
