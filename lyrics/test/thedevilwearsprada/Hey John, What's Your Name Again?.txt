The concept of fashion is the one to blame.
Painting the portrait of
Conviction-less existence.
Well, it must be difficult being so gorgeous.
Well it must be difficult claiming to be the kings and queens
but it's all.[x4] for nothing.

This shall pass. megalomania.[x2]

Congratulations on mutiliation
For a life. (x2)
Life! Life! Life! (x2)
I'm going to hope for you,
I'm going to pray
For you amongst the wreckless and the black.
Salvation lies within.
I'm going to hope for you,
I'm going to pray
For you amongst the wreckless and the black.
My time is your's my friend.
We all find ourselves so horribly weak.
(Oh God,) Here's an offering.---Lyrics submitted by Stormy.
