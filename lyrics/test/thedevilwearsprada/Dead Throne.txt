What you hold dear is a false account
what you hold dear offers no salvation
trust in that I'm not right for this
know that I'm not the one to hold you up
I can't hold you[x2]

Dead throne
we've put the world up onto a dead throne[x2]
she will slip away
you will see your downfall
dead throne
we've put the world up onto a dead throne[x2]

I am guilty
I have fallen
there are things that have come between you and me
I'm so sorry[x2]
let all be put to shame who serve carved images

We've put the world on a dead throne[x2]---Lyrics submitted by Eduardo.
