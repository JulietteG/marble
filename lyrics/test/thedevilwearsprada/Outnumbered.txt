Standing at accuracy's demise 
We have reached the new world 
Wasteland

Population converted, one by one (one by one)
Thousands upon thousands
Like scavengers on waste, like vultures on the sick
Zombies outnumber the living

We are the outnumbered 
We are the outnumbered 

Find your post, find your shelter in the hopes of outliving the undead. 
Build your walls, maintain protection with ambitions of beating the odds.

Find your post, find your shelter in the hopes of outliving the undead. 
Build your walls, maintain protection with ambitions of beating the odds.

In a sea of stinking rot, 
In a place where living humans are no longer, the hunters 
All the money in the world won't satisfy the enemy

Standing at accuracy's demise 
We have reached the new world
Wasteland
Mankind is the losing faction; retreat is eternally hopeless

Find your post, find your shelter in the hopes of outliving the undead. 
Build your walls, maintain protection with ambitions of beating the odds.

Find your post, find your shelter in the hopes of outliving the undead. 
Build your walls, maintain protection with ambitions of beating the odds.

With ambitions of beating the odds
We are the outnumbered---Lyrics submitted by trevor.
