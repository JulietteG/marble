[Rick Ross - Chorus]

Im smoking dope, Im on my cell phone
Im selling dope, straight off the iPhone
he wanna quote, he talking 9 zones
he bought four, I front him 5 more

9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls

[Rick Ross - Verse 1]
Suave house, still independent
distribution Mexican
he still sending
no contract, take my word
send a hundred packs bitch

shoe box, no shoes in em
in the two seater, me and two women
no Def Jam, went solo
took the custys prices solo

[Rick Ross - Chorus]

Im smoking dope, Im on my cell phone
Im selling dope, straight off the iPhone
he wanna quote, he talking 9 zones
he bought four, I front him 5 more

9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls

[T.I - Verse 2]
Its the king young gunna
hotter than suana in the summer
n-gga think Im playing round if you wanna
bring the thunder and the lightening
like a sighting if you try me
on that Warren Buffet sh-t
that monkey sh-t behind me
you want me square n-gga you know where to find me
dont call me on my cell
you tryna send a pimp to jail
if you buying 25 you can get it for the twelve
uncut, rocked up, got hand and pale yeah
hey let me send a little message to my enemies
you n-gga get to telling have em buried fore they sentence me
come to ATL, hit any trap they remember me
billionaire swag with a dope boys energy

[Rick Ross - Verse 3]
Soft white, I got that G-mix
Im going Gold, crumbs to the bricks
Im on the road, lets buy some new whips
trick a hundred hoes
spend a few chips
9 piece, straight 8 balls
got your bottom bitch going AWOL
n-ggas looking at ya like you fell off
no sir, not me
Im double platinum just like my Ferrari
bullet proof, n-gga teflon
why you snorting that
that shit stepped on
