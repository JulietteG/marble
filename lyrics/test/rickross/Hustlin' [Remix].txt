[Verse 1 - Jay-Z] 
Hold up 
Who you haters think you talkin' 
to, I'm the fuckin' boss 
White on white, G4, hater get lost 
I'm in the air I don't hear niggaz corny raps 
Yeah nigga Hov is back, that nigga Hov is back 
I got a honey bun, no not a chick 
I got a honey bun, millions nigga 
I got couple hundred 'em 
Ninety-nine problems prick, don't 
become the hundreth one 
'Less you got a hundred lives 
murder bout a hundred, uh 
We don't resort to violence, we 
on resorts and islands 
With linen shorts and shades, case 
they thought you was lyin' 
My Louis slippers, Polo top 
Linen shorts so my balls don't get hot, ha ha 
Yeah I balls a lot, nah I owns the team 
Ricky Ross, Roc-A-Fella, I owns the scene 
Stop playin' with me lames y'all not my equal 
It ain't no coincidence that my age is a kilo 
Which means that I'm pordo, 
which means that I'm gordo 
Which means that I use a G4, like an auto 
I'm a walkin' memorial 
I'm legendary for whippin' whippin' that hard 
So nigga just let that cause go

[Verse 2 - Young Jeezy] 
Hey, let's go 
Snowman bitch, I don't even wear the same draws 
Flat screens on my walls, floors 
look like bowling balls 
I know Big Meech, the real Big Meech 
It's over for you clowns soon as 
my nigga hit them streets 
I see you ridin' homie, but that ain't hard enough 
You know me I might pull up in an armored truck 
I stack big faces, I stack small faces 
I stack all faces, squares white as pillow cases 
I got a dirty mouth but my kicks is clean 
Them folks ridin' hid the pots and the triple beams 
Hit the Dodge spot I must've copped six Magnums 
Marriott suite, I must've used six magnums 
Feds on my tail, you know them boys'll six flag ya 
Testarossa ride, like I'm on a coaster ride 
Sheet mix, remix still talkin' white bricks 
Two million records sold and I'm 
still talkin' white shit
