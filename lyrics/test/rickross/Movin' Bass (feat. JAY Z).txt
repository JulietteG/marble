The pop wars, a hot boy 
Is the fat boy, skinny ties 
Don't empty mine nigga 
Tall ceilings, chandeliers, I'm authentic 
Gettin' long money, short winded 
Lets go and get it nigga 
Bang bang, bitch niggas caught drinkin'
Roll that double lip, get shot and your finger waves 
Twenty chickens watchin' and I still be movin' that base 
Gave a job to the children you scared to raise 
Chain swangin', name rangin' 
Shots fired, same nigga 
We movin' weight I'm at a different base 
I'm out at eighty with my lady screamin'
I'm hard to kill, Dade county, versace
Fourteen dollar bill 
Only one man got the combination to the safe 
Rammin once, but I still 

See them plaques on a nigga wall 
We still movin' base 
Got them records jumpin' off the start 
We still movin' base 
Coppas tried to knock us off 
We still movin' base 
Haters throwin' shots through a niggas door 
And we still movin' base 

Fallin' from the sky, the money bad the bigger 
Angels tatted all on me, pray for a lord sinner 
Rolls Royce Corniche, sweepin' me off my feet 
New bitches they by the fleet and we do em' all by the week 
Just wanna chill, just wanna meet 
Weed man expnsive, three trips a week 
Misses just wanna freak, feds stay up the street 
Know they tellin' the so we leak what we wanna leak
In the house of the lord, my niggas bearin' arms 
His eyes wide, nose runny got what he fiendin' for 
I'm movin' base, we outta state you know my speakers low 
Put the pistol to your mouth now show me to the safe 
Grammy nominated once, but I'm still movin' base 

See them plaques on a nigga wall 
We still movin' base 
Got them records jumpin' off the start 
We still movin' base 
Coppas tried to knock us off 
We still movin' base 
Haters throwin' shots through a niggas door 
And we still movin' base 

You see the plaques on the wall but the yayo still in the spot 
See me cousin off to college, I see that it costs alot 
Tallons fillin' the jammy my hammy still in my heart 
Niggas playin' the corner, guess their playin' their part 
Jump in the coupes, ladies stay on our feet 
Your brother went to the duplex 
My little dope from across the street 
Hoodies come in all flavors, all black if you think you're sweet 
Sellin' grenades by the box, you'll get it cheap 
Schoolin' the little niggas, kilos all in the campus 
A passport is necessary visa with all the
I beef with all of the, headshots
BR-80 just a plus don't mention the dust 
R-O-C double M kill anything we touch 

See them plaques on a nigga wall 
We still movin' base 
Got them records jumpin' off the start 
We still movin' base 
Coppas tried to knock us off 
We still movin' base 
Haters throwin' shots through a niggas door 
And we still movin' base ---
