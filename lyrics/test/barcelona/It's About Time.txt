One more day down these stairs
this room is cold now
and it hurts like hell
He holds tight 
he stares
It's almost over
and it's running through his head
they don't know me
They don't know more than I show

She's walking up to him so slowly
It's about time
It's about time
to fly away, but wait
this one is different cuz she's lonely
fold your wings 
you'll ned them more one day

One more smile
one more breath
her eyes are dark now
and they hurt like hell
she's so still, she's dead
she knows it's over
and she holds her head and says:
They can't run away
they can't know what i don't show

He's walking up to her so slowly
it's about time
it's about time
to fly away, but wait
this one is different cuz he's lonely
fold your wings 
you'll need them more one day

There have been too many times
when I've drowned you with these perfect lines
and you've heard me say:
I can cure you
this morning i woke up 
with this overwhelming fear of love
and i'm not sure if I can resurrect you

And now, I'm walking up to you so slowly
it's about time
it's about time 
to fly away, but wait
I swear it's different cuz I'm lonely
Fold your wings 
you'll need them more one day---Lyrics submitted by LinZ.
