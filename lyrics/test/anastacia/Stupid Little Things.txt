Stuck on the wrong side of heaven
But I did it to myself
I did it to myself
Traded in my forever
But I did it to myself
I did it to myself

When I get too close to my someday
Every time I blow it away
Praying I will come to my senses
Won't be my own worst enemy

And I put my heart back together
Yeah I put my heart back together

Now I know what love is worth in a broken world
But I can't get past the hurt
'Til I give up on these stupid little things
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things
That keep me from you

Treated love like a bad religion
Yeah I did it to myself
I did it to myself
But I won't stay here unforgiven
When I did it to myself
I did it to myself

When I get too close to my someday
Every time I blow it away
Praying I will come to my senses
Won't be my own worst enemy

And I put my heart back together
I said, I put my heart back together

Now I know what love is worth in a broken world
But I can't get past the hurt
'Til I give up on these stupid little things
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things
That keep me from you

Hey, hey

Living in a world of fantasy
There is nothing left of me
Now I gotta face reality
Hold on trying to believe
I don't want to give up on you

Now I know what love is worth in a broken world
But I can't get past the hurt
'Til I give up on these stupid little things
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things
That keep me from you
That keep me from you
That keep me from you
That keep me from you

'Til I give up on these stupid little things
I'm so hung up on these stupid little things

That keep me from you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
