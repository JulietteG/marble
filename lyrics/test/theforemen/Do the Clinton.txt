Come on everybody, get into the spin
Now that he's been in for however long it's been
Grin a good ol' grin, tuck in your second chin
And everybody do the Clinton

Come on and slide over to the middle
Straighten up and step light
Lean it to the left a little
Now lean a lot to the right

Come on and take a definite position
Now do a total turnabout
Shake your finger at the media
See how good they'll be to ya
Everybody do the Clinton

Come on everybody, join the promenade
When you start to fade and the public is swayed
Hustle free trade and stage a bombing raid
And everybody do the Clinton

Come on and slide over to the middle
Straighten up and step light
Lean it to the left a little
Now lean a lot to the right

Bend over makin' everybody happy
Now let the other guy lead
Try appearing Jeffersonian
Bring another crony in
Everybody do the Clinton

Now step up
Grandstand
Back down
It was harder than you planned
Do lunch
With Streisand
Shuck 'n' jive
Now jam with the band!

Come on and slide over to the middle
Straighten up and step light
Lean it to the left a little
Now lean a lot to the right

And now a little diplomatic sidestep
Stomp on the nominee
Start to feel a little ill at ease
With your own abilities
Everybody do the Clinton

Now do the old administrative shuffle
And the continental hop
Have another waffle
And try to flip your latest flop

Now hang in there and try to keep on truckin'
Take it one step at a time
Do just like your mama says
Make good on your promises
Everybody do the Clinton

Do just like your mama says
Make good on your promises
Everybody do the Clinton

Well, he either will or he
Won't, it's up to Hillary
Everybody do the Clinton

Do the Clinton, come on and do the Clinton . . .---Lyrics submitted by Tim Desmond.
