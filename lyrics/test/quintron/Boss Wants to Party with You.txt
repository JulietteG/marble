Lady, you might be a hustler
Hustle on, muscle on fool
Maybe, you might be a hustler at birth
The boss has fallen for you 

Down by the river
Hangin out with some guys
Pretty fellas, [unintelligible phrase]

I could never, ever avoid, 
Hold on, too
And lady, you might be a hustler
But the boss wants to party with you 

Down South, plus the windows out
[unintelligible phrase]
Strap it up, strap down
[unintelligible phrase]
The boss wants to party with you

Marble Walls and bathroom Stalls
Im the home, home of a hard-tack wall (?)
And maybe I might be a hustler, 
Hustler to you

And lady you might be a hustler,
The boss wants to party with you

Down South, plus the windows out
[Unintelligible phrases]

Lady, you might be a hustler
Hustle on, muscle on, fool
Lady, you might be a hustler
The boss has fallen for you

Down by the river hanging out with some guys
Pretty lady [unintelligible phrase]

But I could never, never hold on to
And lady, you might be a hustler
The boss wants to party with you
The boss wants to party, the boss wants to party with you

The boss wants to party with you
The boss wants to party with you
The boss wants to party with you---Lyrics submitted by Alex L.
