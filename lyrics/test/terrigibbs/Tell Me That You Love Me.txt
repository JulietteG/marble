So far away on a cold, lonely night
If I could only hear your voice,
then Id be alright
Tell me that you love me,
Tell me that you care
I just want to hear your voice
Come floating through the air
Telephones are lonely
Tell me youre alright
I just want to feel you near
When I lay down tonight.

Id give anything to see your face
Just to share the silence of your eyes
Your love is something no one can replace
While Im gone I dont want you to cry
Please dont cry.

Tell me that you love me,
Tell me youre okay
Telephones are lonely
It sounds so far away
Tell me that you need me
Tell me its alright
I just want to hear your voice
When I lay down tonight.

Id give anything to taste your kiss
Just to feel your body touching mine
It hurts me to be wanting you like this
So tell me that you love me one more time
One more time

Tell me that you love me
Tell me youre alone
I just want to hear your voice
Im so far from home
Tell me that you love me,
Tell me that you care
I just want to hear your voice
Come floating through the air.

Tell me that you love me,
Tell me that you care
I just want to hear your voice
Come floating through the air
Telephones are lonely
Tell me youre alright
I just want to feel you near
When I lay down tonight.---Lyrics submitted by Lorena.
