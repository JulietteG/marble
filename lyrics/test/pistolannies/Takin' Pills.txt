She's on the highest dose of Prozac a woman can take, 
She's likes to pop her pain pills with every little ache, 
She's got a Tennessee mountain point of view, 
If your gonna have one might as well have two 

Raised up right in the hills of Kentucky, 
No she ain't gonna smile til she lights up her lucky, 
No filter on her mouth or her cigarettes 
Oh baby what your lookin' at is what you get 

Ya we owe 400 dollars to the boys in the band 
Gas lights blinking on our broke down van 
We're living on truck stop burgers and fries 
Crossing our fingers for a vacancy sign 
Now who in the hell is gonna pay these bills 
When one's drinking, ones smoking, ones taking pills 

She's a root tootin' pistol from the Lone Star State 
She's mixes up a double at the break of everyday 
She might get crazy but she don't get mean 
Until some drunk cowboy asks her to sing 

Ya we owe 400 dollars to the boys in the band 
Gas lights blinking on our broke down van 
We're living on truck stop burgers and fries 
Crossing our fingers for a vacancy sign 
Now who in the hell is gonna pay these bills 
When one's drinking, one's smoking, one's taking pills 

Now we ain't ashamed of who we are 
We like fast men and cheap guitars 
Ain't trying to get rich just trying to get by 
By playing for tips on a Saturday night 

We owe 400 dollars to the boys in the band 
Gas lights blinking on our broke down van 
We're living on truck stop burgers and fries 
Crossing our fingers for a vacancy sign 
Now who in the hell is gonna be pay these bills 
When one's drinking, one's smoking, one's taking pills ---
