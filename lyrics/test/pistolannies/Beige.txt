Mama can't get off
Said it's pretty in the fall 
And the flowers would be
Roses and daisys

And she prayed nobody saw
The weight that i put on
The bride shouldn't be 
Four months and three weeks

Daddy's pride and joy 
Was marring some boy
And he looked afraid
The Preacher turned the page
And i was wearing beige

No where baptist church
Rinkles in his shirt
No ones having a ball
At the reception hall

And we didn't take no honey moon
With what we got ourselves into 
A quick i do and than
Back home again

Daddy's pride and joy
Was marring some boy
Now everyone in this place
Knows i didn't wait
Cause i was wearing beige
I was wearing beige---Lyrics submitted by Lacey Mancil.
