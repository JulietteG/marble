I'm hell on heels
Say what you will
I've done made the devil a deal
He made me pretty
He made me smart
And I'm going to break me a million hearts
I'm hell on heels, baby I'm comin' for you

This diamond ring on my hand
Is the only good thing that came from that man
Got a GTO from one named Joe
And a big piece of land down in Mexico
I'm hell on heels, baby I'm comin' for you

I got a pink guitar, a Lincoln Town Car
From ol' what's his name I met at a bar
Got a high-rise flat in Hollywood
From a married man who wasn't up to no good
I'm hell on heels, baby I'm comin' for you

Then there's Jim, I almost forgot
I ran him off, but I took the yacht
Poor ol' Billy, bless his heart
I'm still using his credit card
I'm hell on heels, Sugar Daddy I'm comin' for you

I'm hell on heels, say what you will
I've done made the devil a deal
He made me pretty
He made me smart
And I'm gonna break me a million hearts
I'm hell on heels baby I'm comin' for you

I'm hell on heels, say what you will
I've done made the devil a deal
He made me pretty
He made me smart
I'm gonna break me a million hearts
I'm hell on heels, Sugar Daddy I'm comin' for you! ---
