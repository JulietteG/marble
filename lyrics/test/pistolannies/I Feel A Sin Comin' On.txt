I feel a sin comin' on
I feel a right that's about to go wrong
I got a shiver down to the bone
I feel a sin comin' on

I gotta buzz in my brain
Drunk on a love goin' down like champagne
I got a feelin' it's gonna leave a lipstick stain
And I'd be the only one to blame

And you can see it
All over my face
Sweet temptation
All over the place
Give me tall dark and handsome,
Mix it up with something strong
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on

Please Jesus don't hold me back
I know it ain't mine but I want it so bad
The smoke in the whiskey
Got me feeling easy
And after I'll fade in the glass

And you can see it
All over my face
Sweet temptation
All over the place
Give me tall dark and handsome,
Mix it up with something strong
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on

And you can see it (and you can see it)
All over my face (all over my face)
Sweet temptation
All over the place
Give me tall dark and handsome,
Mix it up with something strong
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on ---
