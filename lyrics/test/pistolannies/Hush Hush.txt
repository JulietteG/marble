My brother got out of rehab
Right around Christmas time
Mama made a turkey
Daddy was worried he was gonna have to break up a fight

Everybody was walking on eggshells
Drinking eggnog instead of beer
We were holdin' our tongues, scratchin' our heads
Wonderin' how the hell we got here

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush.

We were sitting around the dinner table
And we were eating our pumpkin pie
While the sugar-coated pretty little secret was eating everybody alive

Well daddy's reading propaganda
And he's talking 'bout the end of days
Well cheers to the vodka mama's been sneakin'
Let's all gather 'round and pray.

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush.

So I snuck behind the red barn
And I took myself a toke
Since everybody here hates everybody here
Hell I might as well be the joke

I'm gonna dance up on the table
Singing "This Little Light of Mine"
God gave it to me, what good's it gonna do me
If I don't, by God, let it shine

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush.

Hide your tattoo, put on your Sunday best,
Pretend you're not a mess, be the happy family in the front pew

Hush, hush, don't you dare say a word
Hush, hush, don't you know the truth hurts
Hush, hush, when push comes to shove it's best to keep it hush, hush.

Best to keep it hush, hush.---
