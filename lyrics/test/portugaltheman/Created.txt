I don't know why were created. 
but i know that, i know we all die.
(know we all die)
Go pick up all your tools build a roof.
I'll pick up all mine and build one too. 

I just do as i do. 
Yea i do as i Please. 
And that's all. I can do. 

i don't know why were created.
but i know that. i know we all die. 
(know we all die)
listen to the cars just passing through. 
helpin all those friends that helped you too. 

Yea you do as you do. 
You just do as you please. 
and that's all you can do. 
(that's all you can do.)

I don't know why were created. 
but i know that. i know we all die. 
open up your arms and hold on too. 
every thing you own that owns you too. 
and just let it all go. 
cause we do as we please. 
and that's all we can do. 
(its all we can do)

i don't know why were created. 
but i know that. i know we all die. 
and that's all we can do.---Lyrics submitted by Chloe.
