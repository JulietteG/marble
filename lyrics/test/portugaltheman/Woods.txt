when i lived in the woods
when i lived in the woods
when i lived in the woods
everything was all right, everything
everything was all right

never knew where we are
never needed to know
never needed to know
just where we are
everything was all right
all the people
all the people were living it right

i breathe in time
to be where i was
if i need
baby, gimme all your love
if we need
to find the time
we'll never see
all your love

you find yourself in need
when we gotta go 
then we'll bring along some company
you find yourself in need
if we got it all 
then we got just what we need
why, why, why, why, why?

i breathe in time
to be where i was
if i need
baby, gimme all your love
if we need
to find the time
we'll never see
all your love

when i lived in the woods
when i lived in the woods
when i lived in the woods
everything was all right, everything
everybody was all right

well, you gotta get out
gotta make some money
baby gotta grow
baby gotta get bigger
all the people were all right
all the people
all the people were living it right

i breathe in time
to be where i was
if i need
baby, gimme all your love
if we need
to find the time
we'll never see
all your love, all your love
why, why, why, why?---Lyrics submitted by Dillon.
