If I could start all over with you again,
Id change the way the story ends.
Id try my best to help you along,
If ever theres anything wrong,
But I know you gotta be moving on.

Baby its gonna be fine if you have to go
And I always wish you well you know.
Its time for you to do everything
you always wanted to do.
So, Ill see you when you make it through

I couldnt do anything right.
I couldnt do anything right.
I was so far away and you shut me outside.
Shut me outside, shut me outside.

God I wish I was sleeping with you tonight,
We could listen to the rain outside,
Id tell you a story, sing you a song, promise you nothing is wrong
But I know you gotta be moving on.

I couldnt do anything right.
I couldnt do anything right.
I was so far away and you shut me outside.

Its time for you to do everything
you always wanted to do.
So, Ill see you when you make it through.
Yeah, Ill see you when you make it through.---Lyrics submitted by Randon.
