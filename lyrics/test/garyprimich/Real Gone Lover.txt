Im a real gone lover, Im hip, Im in the know.
Im a real gone lover, Im hip, Im in the know.
And if we love one time, youll sure come back for more.

Come over to my pad.
Come over to my pad and play.
Come over to my pad.
Come over to my pad and play.
Like the old saying goes, 
While the sun shines lets make hay.

Chorus:
Im a nervous fella.
Im a nervous fella. 
Im a nervous fella.
Im a nervous fella.
Im a nervous fella, so dont make me wait all night.

(Guitar solo)
