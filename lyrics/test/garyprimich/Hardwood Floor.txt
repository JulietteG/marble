Well I lost my mind
On a hardwood floor
Big chunk of my soul
Never made it out that door

Come shake the hand of a stranger
We never met before
Since I lost my mind
On a hardwood floor.

Dont tell my mother
Shape Im in
Livin in the shadows
Drownin in a bucket of gin
Im just a lonesome stranger
Walkin in your tavern door
Looking for the pieces
On that hardwood floor.
(harp solo)

Good good whiskey
And warm red wine
Used to understand me
Used to be good friends of mine
Now they just disappoint me
When I need em more and more
Since I lost my mind
On that hardwood floor.
(guitar solo)

This is my reward
For a life of sin
I sold my soul
And my heart caved in
Time slipped right through my fingers
Like sand it sifted out that door
Since I lost my mind
On that hardwood floor.
Since I lost my mind
On that hardwood floor.---Lyrics submitted by Chris Balding.
