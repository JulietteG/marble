I got you letter on the table.
The keys still in the car.
Your lipstick stained upon my pillow, 
From the night before.
I wish I knew my right from wrong, 
I wish I had affliction.
Since I read your letter, 
Girl, you been my new addiction.

Well I don't need you to be my stepping stone.
I just want you to come back home, 
And just breathe and believe
It will be alright.
But tonight for tonight, 
Just let it be.

I never was one for introductions, 
Till I first saw your face.
And blinded by my intuitions, 
I had to take my chance now.
And looking back, you had your reasons.
I couldn't read between the lines, 
And now you're gone.
Nothing else that I can do.

I don't need you to be my stepping stone.
Yeah, I just want you to come back home, 
And just breathe and believe
It will be alright.
But tonight for tonight, 
Just let it be.

All the years that I have spent on you, 
Does it really even matter?
Through the years, would we amount to something?
Does it really even matter?

I don't need you, 
I don't need you to be my stepping stone.
I just want you to come back home, 
And just breathe and believe
It will be alright.
But tonight for tonight, 
Just let it be.

Well I don't need you to be my stepping stone.
I just want you to come back home, 
And just breathe and believe
It will be alright.
But tonight for just one day.---Lyrics submitted by Autumn.
