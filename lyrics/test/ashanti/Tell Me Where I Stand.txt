[Chorus)
Tell Me Where I Stand
Are We Gonna Be Hand In Hand
Or Did I Just Fall In Love With A Friend
Tell Me Where I Stand
We Aint Gotta Move It No Where
I Just Gotta Kno Where I Am
[Verse 1)
You Gotta Kno What Im Feelin When I See You Babe
Its Been A While We Been Dealing With Each Other This Way-aay
And Im Always Here To Wipe Your Tears
Lying By Your Side If They Turn On You
I Wanna Be Your All Is What I Wanna Do
Im Giving You All I Can
I Gotta Righ To Kno Where I Stand
[Chorus)
Tell Me Where I Stand 
Are Be Gonna Be Hand In Hand
Or Did I Just Fall In Love With A Friend
Tell Me Where I Stand
We Aint Gotta Move It No Where
I Just Gotta Kno Where I Am
[Chorus)
Tell Me Where I Stand
Are We Gonna Be Hand In Hand
Or Did I Just Fall In Love With A Friend
Tell Me Where I Stand
We Aint Gotta Move It No Where
I Just Gotta Kno Where I Am
[Verse 2)
I Always Wanna See You Smiling Back At Me
And I Been Thinkin This Is Where I Wanna Be
If I Can Make It So You'll Never Hurt Again
I'll Do Whatever Say Whatever Give The Best I Can
Should I Have Another Waiting On The Side
Should I Have Another That I See At Night
I Wanna Be With You And This Is What I Planned
But I Gotta Kno Where I Stand
[Chorus)
Tell Me Where I Stand 
Are We Gonna Be Hand In Hand 
Or Did I Just Fall In Love With A Friend 
Tell Me Where I Stand 
We Ain't' Gotta Move It No Where 
I Just Gotta Know Where I Am 
[Chorus)
Tell Me Where I Stand 
Are We Gonna Be Hand In Hand
Or Did I Just Fall In Love With a Friend
Tell Me Where I Stand 
We Aint Gotta Move It No Where
I Just Gotta Kno Where I Am
[Bridge)
Tell Me Should I Care If You Stay Out All Night
Tell Me Should I Care If You Go Out With Another Girl
And If You Give A Damn Where Im At
And If You Give A Damn Where I Am
Then I Gotta Kno Where I Stand
[Chorus x4)
Tell Me Where I Stand
Are We Gonna Be Hand In Hand
Or Did I Just Fall In Love With A Friend
Tell Me Where I Stand We Aint Gotta Move It No Where 
I Just Gotta Kno Where I Am---Lyrics submitted by ashley.
