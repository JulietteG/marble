Verse 1
See my days are cold without you(here's anotha one)
But Im hurting while I'm with you(and anotha one)
And though my heart cant take no more,
I cant keep running back to you
See my days are cold without you 
But Im hurting while Im with you
And though my heart cant take no more
I wont keep running back to you

                                Ashanti
I think I found my strength yo finally get up and leave
No more broken heart for me
No more telling your lies to me
Im lookin like I got my head on right so now I see
 No more giving you everything
There's no more takin my love from me

Chorus

Glad to wake uo everyday without you on my brain
No more waiting late at night
No more havin to fuss and fight
Im proud to say that I will never make the same mistake
No more thinkin about what you do
There's no more of me running back to you

Chorus

Biggie

Some say the x make the sex spec-tacular
Let me lick from yo neck to yo back
Then ya shiverin tongue deliverin
Chills up that spine that a** is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight no Cristal tonite
If its alright wit you we F**in (that's cool)
Deja vu the blunts sparked finger f**in in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between you legs
you begged for me to stop b/c  you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bead
At the Marriot, we be lucky it we find a spot next to yo sister
Damn I really miss the way she used to rub my back when I hit dat
Way she use to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian. Trips to the carribean but tonights no end

Both
You must be used to me cryin
While you're out bumpin and grinding
but Im leaving you tonight

See my days are cold w/o you 
But im hurting while Im with you
And though my heart cant take no more
I cant keep running back to you

You must used to me crying 
WHile youre out bumping and grinding
But Im leaving you tonight(and another one)---Lyrics submitted by Latoya.
