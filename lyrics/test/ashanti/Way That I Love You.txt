[Chorus:]
After all of the times that we tried,
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made,
I Know Now you don't love me the same

The way that I love
(The way that I love you)

The way that I love
(The way that I love you)

The way that I love
(The way that I love you)

[Verse 1]
I woke up kinda early today, and something told me from that moment it wouldn't be the same
Felt like you were hidin' something, but I didn't push it,
I didn't complain or say nothing
I tried to act like I didn't see it,
'cause deep down I know I didn't wanna believe it
There it was, it was you and her,
you left your sidekick on the night stand and I read

[Pre-Hook]
Everything you did and everything you said,
now I'm standin' here lookin' like damn
I thought it was you and I,
now all I gotta say is why

[Chorus]

[x3]
The way that I love
(The way that I love you)

[Verse 2]
I noticed now that when I'm around, you be tryin' to lock the door, whispering on the phone
Now wait a minute,
since we been in this house you ain't never did this before, tell me what's this about..
(What's this about)
I tried to sit and say to myself,
this here is too good, he don't want nothin' else

There it was, it was you and her,
you left the credit card receipt inside the beamer with

[Pre-Hook]
Everything you bought
And everything you spent, now I'm standing here
once again I thought it was you and I,
now all I have to say is why

[Chorus]

[x3]
The way that I love
(The way that I love you)

Oh Oh
You lied
You lied
Oh why
Why
Yes
Why'd you have to lie to me
Why'd you have to lie to me-e
Why'd you have to lie to me
Why, why, why, why
You lied, you lied, you lied
We made, we made, we made
