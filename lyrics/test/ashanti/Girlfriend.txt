Boy, if I was your girl...friend. I would let you touch everything that I am
Boy, if I was your girl friend (ahh) I wouldn't mind gettin' crazy baby
It could be yours if I was your lady

I can see when you when I close my eyes
I can feel you, I can touch you, I can taste you babe
While I'm in between these sheets layin' wide awake
I'm here thinkin' bout this love I would love to make
Ooh, how can't I fantasize about you babe?
And there's no other way that I can say it, I just wanna be
You and me, you and me, you and me, hey baby, if I was your

Boy, if I was your girl...friend. I would let you touch everything that I am
Boy, if I was your girl friend (ahh) I wouldn't mind gettin' crazy baby
It could be yours if I was your lady

I could almost feel your body over mine, as you run your fingertips right across my spine
Ohh, ain't nothin' I won't do to make you mine
I will let you take control of what I have inside
And I can feel your heart beatin' right next to mine
And everything you feel, I see it right in your eyes
This could be, you and me, you and me, you and me...hey baby, if I was your

Boy, if I was your girl...friend. I would let you touch everything that I am
Boy, if I was your girl friend (ahh) I wouldn't mind gettin' crazy baby
It could be yours if I was your lady

If I was your girlfriend, ooh, ooh, I would give you everything boy
If I was your girl, girlfriend yeah, yes
I would give all of me to you

Boy, if I was your girl...friend. I would let you touch everything that I am
Boy, if I was your girl friend (ahh) I wouldn't mind gettin' crazy baby
It could be yours if I was your lady

If I was your lady baby, I could drive you crazy
If I was your lady baby, yeah yeah---Lyrics submitted by aleesha.
