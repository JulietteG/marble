[Verse 1:]

I search for love before
For a love that I thought I couldn't find
I searched day in and day out
For a love that was mine all mine

[Hook:]

I played around with love before
I was silly and you know that I played the fool
But then you came and took my life and you changed it
Cause I know what I want and where it's at Yeah

[Chorus:]

I found lovin'
Since I found you
I'm in love with you
I found lovin'
Since I found you
I'm in love with you
I found lovin'

[Verse 2:]

My sun rises on your face
When I see that certain glow
But picture that's so bright
You're my delight
And that's why I love you so

[Hook:]

I've played around with love before
I was silly and you know that I played the fool
But then you came and took my life and you changed it
Cause I know what I want and where it's at, with you

[Chorus:]

I found lovin' (Somebody to treat me right)
Since I found you 
I'm in love with you babe
I found lovin'
Since I found you
I'm in love with with you
I found lovin'
