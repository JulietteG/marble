You were all that I wanted
I fell in love with all of your heart and your soul
From that moment couldn't imagine
You ever hurting me or mistreating my love
I should have loved

Rivers of tear drops
These sharp pains in my heart
IF this was the way that you loved
You never should have loved me

You never should have loved me
You never should have touched me
You never should have
Never should have told me you loved me and you would never leave me.
'Cause everything that you would do
It made me fall in love with you
Until you left and you made that mistake
Now I can't take you back if I wanted to

(Ohh ohh ohh ohh...)

Balled up, laying in my bed
Thoughts racing through my head
How did we start out in love and end up here
You said you loved me and I believed you
Seems like you don't even mean what you say.

Rivers of tear drops,
This short pains in my heart
This was the way that you loved
You never should have loved me

You never should have loved me
You never should have touched me
You never should have,
Never should have told me you loved me and you would never leave me.
'Cause everything that you would do
It made me fall in love with you
Until you left and you made that mistake
Now I can't take you back if I wanted to

You were all that I wanted
I fell in love with you
'cause you loved me and I thought that you were ready
I thought that we were gonna be a family
And if you weren't then you should have let me
Keep all my love to give
To someone else

You never should have loved me
You never should have touched me
You never should have
Never should have told me you loved me and you would never leave me.
'Cause everything that you would do
It made me fall in love with you
Until you left and you made that mistake
Now I can't take you back if I wanted to

Yeah, yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm hmmm.---Lyrics submitted by Tamika.
