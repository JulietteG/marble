Whooo, no,no,no, ho, whoo, uhuhoh, yea, yea

Chorus
After all of this time that we tried,
I found out we were living a lie,
And after all of this love that we made, i know now you don't love me the same
The way that i love you......  * 6 times

1st verse
I woke up kinda early today..
Cuz somethin told from that moment it wouldnt be the same
I felt like you were hiding something, 
but i didnt push, i didn't complain or say nothing
I tried to act like I didn't see it 
cuz deep down i knew I didn't wanna believe it
but there it waz, it waz you and her
you left the sidekick on the night stand 
and i read....everything you did and everything you said
and now im standing here looking like ..DAMN

Chorus
I thought it waz you and I, now all I got to say is.. WHY?
After all of this time that we tried,
I found out we were living a lie,
And after all of this love that we made, i know now you don't love me the same
The way that i love you......  * 6 times

2nd verse
Whoooo, hooo, ohhhh, ooohh, woowoohooh, yea
I notice now that when Im around, 
you be  tryna lock the door wisperin on the phone,
now wait a minute, since we been in this house,
You aint never did this before , tell me what's this about?
I tried to sit and say to myself, this here is too good 
he dont want nothing else! But there it waz, it waz you and her 
you left the credit card to see, and inside the bill it read...
Everything you bought, and everything you spend 
and now im standing here once again,
I thought it was you and I , now all I have to say is....

Hooo, hooo, hoo, hoo, ohh, (huh, hoo,uhohh)Hooo, hooo, hoo, hoo, ohh

Chorus
After all of this time that we tried, ( why why why)
I found out we were living a lie, ( you Lie, You Lie, You lie)
And after all of this love that we made, i know now you don't love me the same
The way that i love you......  * 6 times
