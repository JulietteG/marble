He slipped the ring off his finger
when he walked in the room
and he found him some stranger
and he promissed her the moon

CHORIS (Vince and patty loveless)
How many lies
that you must have told
you think your a rich man
with your pocket full of gold

and for another mans treasure
youd say anything
but is one night of pleasure, worth the trouble youll bring?
dont look so suprised
for son i should know 
cuz i once was a rich man
with my pocket full of gold

CHORIS (Vince and Patty loveless)
some night your gonna wind up
on the wrong end of the gun
some day the skys gonna show us
and youll pay for what youve done

Vince and PATTY LOVELESS
and what will they see
on your tomb stone
that here lies a rich man
with his pocket full of gold

yea here lies a rich man 
with his pocket full of gold........---Lyrics submitted by Dustin.
