Sometimes a drifter
Sometimes a peaceful man
Years and years of talking
Though little to understand
Where does love go, when it flies away
I would think that it would last 'till the end of time

Sometimes a drunkard
Sometimes a holy man
Years and years of walking
With little to understand
Why do we think we are the only ones
That really matter to everyone in the whole wide world

Sometimes a husband
Sometimes a single dad
Years and years of trying
To not be so dark and sad
When does this life become easier
I would think all of this work would be worth something

Sometimes I'm happy
Often times, not so
Years and years of wandering
Not knowing where to go
How do you do
Good to know you
May we find in our togetherness
Honest joy---Lyrics submitted by G Morrocco.
