You and I
Two of a mind
This loves
One of a kind

You and I
Were drifting
Over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

You and I
Learning to speak
With kisses on cheeks

You and I
Were lifted
Over the edge

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?

And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?

Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?---
