I should ink my skin with your name
take my passport out again
and just replace it
see i could do without a tan
on my left hand
where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
i should run you a hot bath
and fill it up with bubbles

cause maybe you're loveable
and maybe you're my snowflake
and your eyes turn from green to grey
in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
and you should never cut your hair
cause i love the way you flick it of your sholder

and you will never know
just how beautiful you are 
to me
but maybe im just in love 
when you wake me up

and would you ever feel guilty
if you did the same to me
would you make me a cup of tea
to open my eyes in the right way
and i know you love shrek
cause we've watched it twelve times
but maybe your hoping for a fairytale too
but if your dvd breaks today
you should've got a vcr
cause I've never owned a blu-ray
true say

and I've always been shit at computer games
and your brother always beats me
and if i lost 
I'd go across
and chuck all of the controllers at the tv
then you'd laugh at me
and be asking me
if I'm gonna be home next week
then you'd lie with me
'till i fall asleep
and flutter eyelash on my cheek
between the sheets

and you will never know 
just how beautiful you are
to me
but maybe I'm just in love 
when you wake me up

i think you hate the smell of smoke
you always try to get me to stop
you drink as much as me
and i get drunk a lot
so i take you to the beach
and walk along the sand
and I'll make you a heart peandant
with a pebble held in my hand
and I'll carve it like a necklace
so the heart falls where your chest is
and now a piece of me
is a piece of the beach
and it falls just where it needs to be
and rests peacefully
so you just need to breathe
to feel my heart against yours now
against yours now

and you will never know
just how beautiful you are
to me
but maybe im just in love 
when you wake me up
maybe im just in love
when you wake me uuuup
maybe i fell in love 
when you woke me up---Lyrics submitted by Genevieve.
