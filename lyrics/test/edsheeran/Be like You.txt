And happy days
That left us on the floor
And you breathe me
Till youre not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton
Ill take you along the Pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened
Ill make it disappear, dear

Darling, dont be nervous
Ill understand
If you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, when Im missing you
Ill stop eating food
And Ill squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then Ill see your bitterness
And why youre leaving too
Maybe, Ill put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

And sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you squeeze me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
Ill give up and be frustrated
Can you see whats wrong?
If you feel like youve been hated
This loves too overrated
See whats going on, on

Darling, dont be nervous
Ill understand
If you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, when Im missing you
Ill stop eating food
And Ill squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then Ill see your bitterness
And why youre leaving too
Maybe, Ill put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road

Now Im missing you
Ive stopped eating food
And Ive squeezed into your dress
So I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought Id put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

And I stopped eating food
And I squeezed into your dress
So I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
Maybe Ill put you to a test
And say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me too---
