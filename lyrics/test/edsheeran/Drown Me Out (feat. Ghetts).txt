Im in so deep Omar Epps can relate to my situation on a real,
Pain aint the emotion I wanna feel but Im thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
Ill be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I cant afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
Its dark when Im about just me myself and my shadow
I'm parro, running out of ammo, and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so its narrow
The less then the better, a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess I'm clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my minds infected with terror
No wonder Im under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It easy when you look back, shoulda, woulda, coulda but I bet you cant bring should woulda could back
Back to fifteen I said to myself, that Im more than a hood track!

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You wont drown me out, out, out
You wont drown me out

You cant ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around about 6'1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without, a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like Im choking? Seriously, do I sound like Im joking?
Im floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's sunk many years, Im maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when its in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them Im broken
No real shit, throw my skin aint close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this ain't tug of war, still don't get roped in the open, I dont wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then Ima kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you dont wanna see this guy survive.

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You wont drown me out
You wont drown me out

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You wont drown me out
You wont drown me out.---
