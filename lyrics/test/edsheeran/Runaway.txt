Ive know it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I dont wanna know where hes been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morn-in go

How long you leaving
Well dad just dont expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
Its been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I dont wanna live in his home
Theres nothing to say cos he knows
Ill just runaway and be on my own

Ive never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
Ill tell you its about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what Im gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when its morn-in go
How long you leaving
Well dad just dont expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
Its been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I dont wanna live in his home
Theres nothing to say cos he knows
Ill just runaway and be on my own

Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasnt down with that plan to attack, intends to show love

I dont wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints I guess that god knows that
I dont wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces and hope that
Things change but for now Ill leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

I love him from my skin to my bones
But I dont wanna live in his home
Theres nothing to say cos he knows
Ill just runaway and be on my own---
