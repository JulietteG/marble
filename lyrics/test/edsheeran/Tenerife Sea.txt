You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cos all that you are is all that Ill ever need

So in love

You look so beautiful in this light
You silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
Just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear into the wilderness

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cos all that you are is all that Ill ever need

So in love

Lumiere darling, lumiere over me

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cos all that you are
Is all that Ill ever need

So in love

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment
I knew you, Beth---
