The only version they're released so far is their acoustic one which is just 
fingerpicking - and as the
fingerpicking isn't standard chords, these don't match the recording perfectly, but they 
do fit the vocals.
Well I'm sure I get under your skin
And I've tried almost everything

To catch your attention tonight                
You just turn a blind eye       
Turn a blind eye                         
Well I only wish I had something to give
So I'd stop aimlessly wondering
Maybe someday soon you'll know that
Every single word that you say

Every little thing that you do
It's like a hurricane
Cause I'm secretly crazy for you
Darlin' every time that you leave,
You're making me feel so blue
Hiding my heart away
Cause I'm secretly crazy for you
Yeah I'm secretly crazy for you
Ooooh.

Well I've tried to declare how I feel
Through flowers and cards surrounded in mystery
I could shout from the top of my lungs
But the cat's got my tongue
The cat's got my tongue
Well I only wish I had something to give
So I'd stop aimlessly wondering
Maybe someday now you'll know that

Every single word that you say
Every little thing that you do
It's like a hurricane
Cause I'm secretly crazy for you
Darlin' every time that you leave,
You're making me feel so blue
Hiding my heart away
Cause I'm secretly crazy for you
Yeah I'm secretly crazy for you
Oooh

Well I only wish I had something to give 
So I'd stop aimlessly wondering
How in the world can I make you see that
Every single word that you say
Every little thing that you do
It's like a hurricane
Cause I'm secretly crazy for you

Darlin' every time that you leave
You're making me feel so blue
Hiding my heart away
Cause I'm secretly crazy for you
Oh I'm hopelessly crazy for you
Oh I'm hopelessly crazy for you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
