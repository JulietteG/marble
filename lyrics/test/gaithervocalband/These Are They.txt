The oceans give up all the dead that are in them
The graves open wide to set captives free
And those who are roaming the earth rise to meet them
Abraham's Seed, as the sands of the sea.

These are they who have come out of great tribulation
They have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb
They have come through much sorrow into great jubilation
And they're redeemed by the blood of the Lamb

And like a strong and mighty army their voices are ringing
Oh, the great cloud of witnesses sing freedom's song
As they enter the country built by their own Father
The promised home land, they've looked for so long

And all the strangers and all the pilgrims,We will be no longer strangers
Oh the tired and the weary wanderers, they will wander no more
The table is spread for the great celebration
And the welcome home banner, it flies over the door

And these are they who have come out of great tribulation
They have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb
They have come through much sorrow into great jubilation
And they're redeemed by the blood of the Lamb

They're redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, The Lamb.---Lyrics submitted by Darin.
