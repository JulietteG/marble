No one said that this was a picnic
Bumpin' with you's like hittin' a wall
You knocked off some of my rough edge's
So I'm gonna hang for the long long haul.

I really need what you bring to the party
Differences here ain't no big deal
'Cause all this rub just makes us better
We sharpen each other like steel on steel.

Well, we're not known for holdin' back opinions
I've got my knack for invadin' your space
I ain't afraid of cleanin' your carpet
And I ain't afraid of gettin' your face.

I really need what you bring to the party
Differences here ain't no big deal
'Cause all this rub just makes us better
We sharpen each other like steel on steel
Yeah we sharpen each other like steel on steel.

When the smoke clears I know you're a brother
Follow this through to the bitter end
If we stick around we might learn something
Something about how to be a good friend.

I really need what you bring to the party
Differences here ain't no big deal
'Cause all this rub just makes us better
We sharpen each other like steel on steel.

I really need what you bring to the party
Differences here ain't no big deal
'Cause all this rub just makes us better
We sharpen each other like steel on steel
Yeah we sharpen each other like steel on steel.

We sharpen each other like steel on steel
We sharpen each other like steel on steel
We sharpen each other like steel on steel.---Lyrics submitted by Rita Tollini.
