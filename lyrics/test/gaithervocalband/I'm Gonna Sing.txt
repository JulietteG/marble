Chorus:
I'm gonna sing just as long
As it takes for a song
To make sad heavy spirits free
I'm gonna keep making music that carries
The secret that Jesus is liberty
I'm gonna turn off the sounds
That would drag people down to the pit of despondency
With a sweet happy tune, He is coming soon
For his children like you and me.

Verse 1:
It's a song that'll carry a message along
Through the densest of foggy nights
And the tune is a rope that can throw a man hope
When he's going down for the third time
It's a sweet melody that can cut your heart free
From the chains of a past defeat
You can suddenly see through the sweet harmony
A path for your wandering feet.

Chorus:
I'm gonna sing just as long
As it takes for a song
To make sad heavy spirits free
I'm gonna keep making music that carries
The secret that Jesus is liberty
I'm gonna turn off the sounds
That would drag people down to the pit of despondency
With a sweet happy tune, He is coming soon
For his children like you and me.

Verse 2: 
Don't tell me the world is a hopeless old place
And i might as well just give in
To the doom and gloom, life's a waiting room
For the blow that will do us all in.
I can't sympathize that before my eyes
Is a hope shining bright as day
I've gotta follow the song that keeps drawing me on
With my feet dancing all the way.


Chorus: Repeat 2x.
I'm gonna sing just as long
As it takes for a song
To make sad heavy spirits free
I'm gonna keep making music that carries
The secret that Jesus is liberty
I'm gonna turn off the sounds
That would drag people down to the pit of despondency
With a sweet happy tune, He is coming soon
For his children like you and me.

Yeah, with a sweet happy tune He is coming soon
For his children like you and me.---Lyrics submitted by Jack Comstock.
