Home is where the heart is, my heart's own home
Though I never really had one to call my own
I've been given a key by the Carpenter of Galilee
With interest paid the title's made to me

Home, where there is no night
Home, where the Son is the light
The place I've been dreaming of so long
Loved ones there to welcome me
But His sweet face will be the first I see
When my journey's over I am going home

Everybody dreams of going home it seems
Lately I am no exception to the rule
But home is so much more than windows, walls and doors
It's a warm embrace and smiling faces awaiting you

Home, where there is no night
Home, where the Son is the light
The place I've been dreaming of so long
Loved ones there to welcome me
But His sweet face will be the first I see
When my journey's over I am going home

Home, where there is no night
Home, where the Son is the light
The place I've been dreaming of so long
Loved ones there to welcome me
But His sweet face will be the first I see
When my journey's over I am going home
And when my journey's over I am going home---Lyrics submitted by Tonsing.
