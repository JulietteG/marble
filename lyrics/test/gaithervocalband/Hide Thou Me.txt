Oh, then I cry "Oh, Rock of Ages, Hide Thou Me"

Sometimes I feel discouraged and I think my works in vain
I'm tempted oft to murmur, to grumble and complain
Oh but then I think of Jesus and all He's done for me

Then I cry "Oh, Rock of Ages, Hide Thou Me"

Oh, Rock of Ages, hide thou me
There is no other refuge can save, Lord, but Thee
And through this dark world I've wandered far, far from Thee

Oh, Then I cry "Oh, Rock of Ages, Hide Thou Me."---Lyrics submitted by Darin.
