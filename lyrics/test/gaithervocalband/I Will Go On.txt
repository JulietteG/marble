I repent,
For moments i have spend,
Recalling all the pains,
And failures of my past,
I repent,
From dwelling on the things,
Beyond my power to change,
The chain that holds me fast,

I will go on,
My past i live be hide me,
I gladly take his mercy and his and love,
he his joy and he is peace,
He is strength and sweet release,
I know he is and i am his,
i will go on 

I give up,
The bitterness and hate,
The blaming men and fate, 
For all my discontent,
The guilt and pain i empty from 
I empty from my cup,
So that god can fill it up,
With peace and sweet content 

I will go on 
My past i live be hide me,
I gladly take his mercy and his love,
He is joy and he is peace,
He is strength and sweet release,
I know he is and i am his 
I will go on---Lyrics submitted by teria.
