Where're you going Rusty James?
To rumble on miles and change
What you doing Patty Sue?
She says "whatcha thinking?"

I'm coming with you
I'm coming with you

Rolling out of east L.A.
Making our way to Santa Fe
Man, sure do look pretty, she said
Feels so good to get myself out of the city

Through the airwaves
Can't you feel the fall out?
It's in the airwaves
Can't you hear me calling out?

(Help me, help me, jump and shout)
(Help me, help me, jump and shout)
(Help me, help me, jump and shout)
(Help me, help me, jump and shout)

Sitting on Landis Hill
Staring out at Beverly Hills
Everybody moving so fast
Makes you feel like you're already part of the past

Through the airwaves
Can't you feel the fall out?
It's in the airwaves
Can't you hear me calling out?

(Help me, help me, jump and shout)
(Help me, help me, jump and shout)
(Help me, help me, jump and shout)

Where're you going Rusty James?
So rumble on miles and change
What you doing Betty Sue?
She says "whatcha thinking?"

I'm coming with you
I'm coming with you
I'm coming with you

(Help me, help me, jump and shout)---
