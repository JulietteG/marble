Barfly
Just a Barfly, baby, uh huh,
Barfly 
Just a Barfly, baby, uh huh

Kiss me, before you go,
I'm going nowhere lately

Barfly
Just a barfly, baby, uh huh
Barfly 
Just a barfly, baby, uh huh

Slow Down, down
Slow down your movin to fast
Slow down, down
Slow down your movin' to fast

Kiss me, before you go
I'm going nowhere lately,
kiss me before uoy go,
I'm going nowhere lately,

nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

come on over a lil bit closer
cause you know what I need right now
so, come on over a lil bit closer
cause you know what I need,

lovin' lovin lovin lovin

hey hey hey---Lyrics submitted by Clare.
