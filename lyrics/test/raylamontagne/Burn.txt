Oh Mama, don't walk away
I'm a goddam sore loser
I ain't too proud to stay

But I'm still thinking 'bout you
And I'm so lonesome without you
And I can't get you out of my mind

Oh Mama, don't leave me alone
With my soul shut down so tight
Just like a stone cold tomb

Ain't it clear when I'm near you
I'm just dying to hear you
Calling my name one more time?

Oh, so don't pay no mind
To my watering eyes
Must be something in the air that I'm breathing

Yes and I try to ignore
All this blood on the floor
It's just this heart on my sleeve that's bleeding

Oh Mama don't walk away
You leave me here bereaving
From the words so hard and plain

Saying the love that we had
Was just selfish and sad
Yes, but to see you now with him is just making me mad

Oh so kiss him again
Just to prove to me that you can
I'll stand here and burn in my skin

Yes, I will stand here and burn in my skin---
