There comes a time, 
A time in everyone's life
When nothing seems to go your way,
When nothing seems to turn out right.

There may come a time.
You just can't seem to find your place.
And for every door you open,
Seems like you get two slammed in your face.

That's when you need someone,
Someone that you, you can call,
When all your Faith is gone
It feels like you can't go on.

Let it be me
Let it be me
 If it's a friend that you need
Let it be me 
Let it be me

Feels like your always coming up last
Pockets full of nothing, ain't got no cash
No matter where you turn, you ain't got no place to turn, yeah
You reach out for something and they slap your hand.

There may come a time
Just how if feels to be all alone
To feel like you've given everything
For just a little place you can call your own.

Thats when you need someone,
Someone that you, you can call,
when all your faith is gone,
it feels like you can't go on

Let it be me
Let it be me'
If it's a friend you need
Let it be me,
Let it be me

Let it be me,
Let it be me
If it's a friend  you need
Let it be me
Let it be me.---Lyrics submitted by jason.
