It was once only dining and dancing
Evening Kisses Morning Smiles
And than you said
Let's go off together
Alone for a while

And I loved you at first for your wicked eyes
and the laughter that loosens your bones
and your soft curls
And the passions I've never known.

My love was a love of the moment
of the strangeness the thrill
but moments deny a tomorrow
and yet I love you still

Well it seems like so little was spoken
Bout ending the games
We just kept waking up still together
And feeling the change

And I loved you for facing my crazy eyes
and using your strengths to build mine
and learning compassion 
And growing more mellow and kind

I've waited to long I've forgotten
what I waited for
Now when in our balance 
I have learned to uncovered all that I wanted
and more.

Yes we bonded for more doubtful tomorrows
but our past grows richer each day
and more and more I can't see me going away

With happiness here for our taking
Resting easy feeling strong
As I delight in this life we are making
I sing you this Valentine's Song---Lyrics submitted by RGrace Rodrigue.
