Writing here
Cause there's nothing left here
For me to do
But please know that
I'm trying to make up for my mistakes
And you're moving on 
With guilty memories
But I was wrong
To ever test us
This broken road is more than I can take

So this is the way that I'll tell you
That I'll leave you alone if you want me to
But I've had enough of this life alone
I'll give it up this time I know
I don't deserve to tell you that I love you
There's nothing in this world I'd take above you
I'm dead inside
Bring me back to life

I'll leave this note for you to read
So you won't forget that all I need is you
Is you!!
And the world is not so clear anymore
Since the day that you walked right out that door
I knew all I need is you

This is the way that I'll tell you
That I'll leave you alone if you want me to
But I've had enough of this life alone
I'll give it up this time I know
I don't deserve to tell you that I love you
There's nothing in this world I'd take above you
I'm dead inside
Bring me back to life

It's never too late to show you who I am
I know you want to love me
I know you understand that I could be your missing page

Bring me back to life 
Bring me back to life 
Bring me back to life 
Bring me back to life 

This is the way that I'll tell you
That I'll leave you alone if you want me to
But I've had enough of this life alone
I'll give it up this time I know
I don't deserve to tell you that I love you
There's nothing in this world I'd take above you
I'm dead inside
Bring me back to life---Lyrics submitted by Cie Cie.
