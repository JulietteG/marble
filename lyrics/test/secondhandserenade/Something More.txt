I lie awake again, my bodies feeling paralysed,
I cant remember when,
I didnt live through this disguise...
The words you said to me,
They couldnt set me free,
Im stuck here in this life i didnt ask for...

-[Chorus]
There must be something more,
Do we know what were fighting for?
 Breathe in, breathe out... (Breathe in, Breathe out)
And all these masks we wore,
We never knew what we had in store...
 Breathe in, breathe out... (Breathe in, Breathe out)


The storm is rolling in,
The thunders loud it hurts my ears...
Im paying for my sins,
And its gunna rain for years and years...
I fooled everyone and now what will i become?
I have to start this over,
I have to start this over...

-[Chorus]

I fooled everyone and now what will i become?
I have to start this over,
I have to start this over...

-[Chorus]

Breathe in, breathe out...
There must be something more,
Breathe in, breathe out...
There must be something more...---Lyrics submitted by Mist.
