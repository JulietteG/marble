Share with me the blankets that your wrapped in
Because its cold outside cold outside its cold out side
Share with me the secrets that you kept in
Because its cold inside cold inside its cold inside

And your slowly shaking finger tips
Show that your scared like me so
Let pretend were alone
And I no you may be scared
And I no were unprepared
But I don't care

Tell me tell me
What makes you think that you are invincible
I can see it in your eyes that your so sure
Please don;t tell me that I am the only one that's vulnerable
Impossible

I was born to tell you I love you
Its that a song already
I get a B in originality
And its true I cant go on without you
Your smile makes me see clear
If you could only see in the mirror what I see

And your slowly shaking finger tips
Show that your scared like me so
Let pretend were alone
And I no you may be scared
And I no were unprepared
But I don't care

Tell me tell me
What makes you think that you are invincible
I can see it in your eyes that your so sure
Please don't tell me that I am the only one that's vulnerable
Impossible

Slow down girl your not going anywhere
Just wait around and see
Maybe I am much more you never no what lies ahead
I promise I can be anyone I can be anything
Just because you were hurt doesn't mean you shouldn't bleed
I can be anyone anything I promise I can be what you need

Tell me tell me
What makes you think that you are invincible
I can see it in your eyes that your so sure
Please don't tell me that I am the only one that's vulnerable
