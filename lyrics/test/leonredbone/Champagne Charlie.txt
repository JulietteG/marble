I went to see young lady
I've been there before
Her shoes and stockings in her hand
And her feet all over the floor
Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name by golly
And rogueing n' stealing is a game

I went down to Louisville
I've been there before
Got kicked in up by a big fat mule
And ain't going back no more
Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name by golly
And rogueing n' stealing is a game

I went to see young lady
I've been there before
She put me out of an old big strump
& I ain't going back no more
Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name by golly
And rogueing n' stealing is a game

I got drunk last night
All the the night before
Ain't gonna get drunk no more
Ain't gonna... 
Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name by golly
And rogueing n' stealing is a game---Lyrics submitted by Sandy Batta.
