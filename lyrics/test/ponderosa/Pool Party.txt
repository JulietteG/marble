We wake up passed out in yards
On your floor, backseats of cars
Find a bed and never sleep
Awake at night and steal the sheets

I will never leave alone
'Cause I can never be alone

Take out the light and praise the moon
Fall from grace in vacant rooms
Pray that morning won't come soon

I will never leave alone
'Cause I can never be alone

Yours now
She's already played out
Burn down
The place where you were last found

Yours now
She's already played out
Burn down
The place where you were last found

We got lost in chandeliers
Drink in the wake of passing years
Speak with sharpest native tongue
You understood when you were young

I will never leave alone
'Cause I can never be alone

I will never leave alone
'Cause I can never be alone

Yours now
She's already played out
Burn down
The place where you were last found

Yours now
She's already played out
Burn down
The place where you were last found---Lyrics submitted by Hunter Stephens.
