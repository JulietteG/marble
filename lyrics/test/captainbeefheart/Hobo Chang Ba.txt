Strawwood claw rattlin' my jaw
I can't call it usin'
It's just something soothin'
Feather times a feather
Mornin' time t' thaw
Hobo Chang Ba
Hobo Chang Ba

Standing still is loosin'
Feather times a feather
Mornin' time t' thaw
Strawwood claw rattlin' my jaw
Hobo Chang Ba
Hobo Chang Ba
Hobo Chang Ba, oooh
Hobo Chang ba, oooh

Stand to gain my ground
Laid to rest the law
The ocean is my mother
Freight train is my pa
Hobo Chang Ba
Hobo Chang Ba, oooh
Hobo Chang Ba

The rails I ride are rustin'
But the new sunrise I'm trustin'
The rails I ride are rustin'
The new sunrise I'm trustin'
Strawwood claw rattlin' my jaw
Hobo Chang Ba, ooh
Hobo Chang Ba
