Pappy with the khaki sweatband, bowed goat potbellied barnyard,
the old fart was smart.
The old, gold cloth madonna, dancin' to the fiddle and saw.
He ran down behind the knoll, and slipped on his wooden fish head.
The mouth worked and snapped all the bees.

Back 't the bungalow, momma was flatten' lard with her red, enameled rolling pin,
when the fish head broke the window, rubber eye erect and precisely detailed.
Airholes from which breaths should come, is now closely fit,
with the chatter of the old fart inside.

An assortment of observations took place.
Momma licked her lips like a cat, pecked the ground like a rooster, pivoted like a duck.
Her stockings down, caught dust and doughballs,
she cracked her mouth, glazed, caught one eyelash,
rubbed her hands on her gorgeous gingham.
Her hands grasped sticky, metal, intricate latchwork.
Open to the room, aaah, smell, cold, mixed with bologna,
rubber bands, crumpled wax paper bonnets, fat goose legs and special jellies,
ignited by the warmth of the room.

The old fart smelled this through his important breather holes,
cleverly he dialed from within, from the outside we observed
that the nose of the wooden mask, where the holes had just been a moment ago,
was now smooth, amazingly blended, camouflaged in,
with the very intricate rainbow trout replica.

The old fart inside was now breathing freely,
from his perfume bottle atomizer air bulb invention.

His excited eyes, from with the dark interior, glazed,
watered in appreciation, of his thoughtful preparation.---Lyrics submitted by Rolf.
