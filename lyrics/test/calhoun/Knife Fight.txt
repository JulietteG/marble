You were blind
For a while, thats all right
Then the scales were falling off from your eyes
What do you see? that you still hate the light
And never choose, but always know what was right

Oh! my damaged dreamer
You will find the words
Just give it time
Give it time

I won't lie, that I lied, but only why
And then again, thats a lie you didn't buy
But kinda tell, all the kind, hurt and hell
The ones you love, the ones who stood with us so well

Oh! it should be easy
Everything is fine
And you were right
You were right

'Cuz i know, a part of you has changed
And I'd kill, you always stay the same
So I'd bravely grab my guns and
Brandish them at your knife
Fight!

I would pray, every night and every day
You're a sin like a mark fairly made
Taking stock, in the world's oldest charade
I'm a saint, so i'm used to never getting paid

Oh! it should be easy
Everything is fine
And you were right
You were right

'Cuz i know, a part of you has changed
And I'd kill, you always stay the same
So I'd bravely grab my guns and
Brandish them at your knife
Fight!

Lead the hosts to a horror
Lead the hosts to a horror
rise

You know the path that I'm walking
You know the path
You know the path alright!

So I'd bravely grab my guns and
Brandish them at your knife
Fight!

Everything is easy
Everything is fine
And you were right

I bravely grab my guns and
Brandish them at your knife
Bravely grab my guns and
Brandish them at your knife
Fight!---Lyrics submitted by Amara.
