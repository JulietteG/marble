If its not those cowboy boots in the summer 
Oh my God I pray for another 
Chance to drive down back highways 
Til I stumble upon your beautiful face 
Your presence isn't what kills me 
It's that artistic gleam 
That's taking over my scenery 
Dream by dream 

You might think I'm incapable 
Of loving a soul like yours 
You might think I'm a fool 
For you 

Girl you got style 
That what I love about you 
The way that you sit back, Oh how you sit back 
And watch this grow 
You got dreams 
And therefore I believe in you 
All the small town people with their big remarks 
They aint got jack to say about my movie star 

Shes got style, ba da da da,da da da-da da, 
Ba da da whooooooo, ohhhhh, oh, oh ho ho yeah, 
Shes got style ,ba da da da,da da da-da da, ba da da 
Whoooo who who youuu, oh oh oh 

If its not the fact that I'm a wee bit younger 
Or the truth that I'm so naive 
See,my heart keeps leaping back to you 
Like a dog tied to a tree 
I know it sounds crazy 
Its ridiculous to me 
But without you by my side girl 

You might think I'm incapable 
Of loving a soul like yours 
You might think I'm a fool 
For you 

Cause' girl you got style 
And thats what I love about you 
The way that you sit back, oh how you sit back 
And watch this grow 
You got dreams 
And therefore I believe in you 
All the small town people with their big remarks 
They aint got jack to say about my movie star 

Shes got style, ba da da da,da da da-da da, 
Ba da da whooooooo, ohhhhh, oh, oh ho ho yeah, 
Shes got style ,ba da da da,da da da-da da, ba da da 
Whoooo who who youuu, oh oh oh, 
All the small town people with their big remarks 
They aint got jack to say about my movie star 
She's got style---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
