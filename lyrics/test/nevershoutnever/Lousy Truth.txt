girl I been thinking a lot 
about who we coulda been
if I was back home just chillin
with you and all my friends
but dear im gone
and that's the lousy truth

for the past 3 years 
I swear ive been a better man
Than who I have become
I know I know I know I let ya down
But dear ive been gone for too damn long

So if you go away right now
Than I can guarantee that I wont break your heart
But if you go and stay then baby I will hope and pray
That you will run away
Cause dear it breaks my heart to see you here

So shine outward, not inward
You've been a selfish little girl for 
The past 3 years ive been through 
More than you could know
And god I don't want you to know
What I have been through
Cause you just wouldn't understand
Youre just a girl with some issues
As bad as it may sound
But youre the girl whos been drivin me mad


So if you go away right now
Than I can guarantee that I wont break your heart
But if you go and stay then baby I will hope and pray
That you will run away
Cause dear it breaks my heart to see you here

So go to school in Chicago
Find a new boy, a new life, a whole new set of friends
Cause all that I will ever do is break your heart
Dear it breaks my heart to see you here
Ya dear it breaks my heart to see ya here

but just so ya know 
I been thinking a lot about who we coulda been
If I was back home just chillin
With you and all my friends
But dear im gone, and that's the lousy truth---Lyrics submitted by Christian.
