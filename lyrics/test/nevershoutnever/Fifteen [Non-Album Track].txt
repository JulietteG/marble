Just the other she was little girl takin' over the world,
With her smile,
But just the other day I saw that little girl takin' a tongue down her throa,
t by boy that didn't give a damn, 

(Chorus)
But she was only fifteen 'cause she was more than willing to take a chance, to find romance, to grow up fast but I, 
know she is so much better, 
than to give it all away to the first guy, first try, first lie, first goodbye

Just the other day she was a little girl taking over the world,
With her laugh,
But just the other day I saw that little girl taking her time with him and I can't say, I've ever been so proud,

(Chorus)
'Cause she is only fifteen but she is more than willing to take a chance, to find romance, to grow up fast but I, 
know she is so much better,
 than to give it all away to the first guy, first try, first lie, first goodbye.---Lyrics submitted by Kiki Williams.
