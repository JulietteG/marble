Oh my god, I. 
Had the most amazing time 
last night,I dreamt I saw you again 
Thats when the flashbacks started to begin.. 

They started slow, 
But they picked up fast, 
So I got off my ass, And 
I ran away.. to Californ-i-a 
Lalalalalalalalala 
Californ-i-a

Oh My god I, 
Shouldve never let you leave 
My side should have never 
Left you alone, It probably 
seems like i'm never coming home 

But I'm so lost, 
Living life fast, 
Please get off 
your ass, so 
I Wont waste 
Away in Californ-i-a 
Lalalalalalalala 
Californ-i-a


Just so you know, 
I'm never coming home 
I'm having a great day.. 
In Californ-i-a 

Lalalalalalalalala---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
