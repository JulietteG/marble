I met a man of two feet tall
This man was quite ambitious 
In a world that is so vicious to us all
I said hi, as he replied
He said listen to these words that i have lived by my whole life

You're only as tall 
As your heart will let you be
And you're only as small 
As the world will make you seem 
And when the going gets rough 
And you feel like you may fall
Just look on the brightside you're roughly six feet tall.

I met a man of twelve feet tall
He towered like a giant 
In a world that was defiant of his height
I said hi, as he replied
He said listen to the words that i have dreaded my whole life.

You're only as tall 
As your heart will let you be
And you're only as small 
As the world will make you seem
And when the going gets roughA
nd you feel like you may fall, just look on the brightside 
You're roughly six feet tall

I am a man of six feet tall.
Just looking for some answers
In a world that answers none of them at all.
I'll say hi, but not reply 
To the letters that you write
Because I've found some peace of mind

Because im only as tall 
As my heart will let me be
And im only as small 
As the world will make me seem
And when the going get rough
And i feel like i may fall 
Just look on the brightside 
Im roughly six feet tall---Lyrics submitted by Heather.
