I got the concept and came to the conclusion
That the top floor was just an illusion
To the fact that I got this break in my back
That I can't get out; I can't figure out how
You appeared right in front of me
Before your marched down south a university
Is where you spend your daylight
We're both just waiting for this friday night

Although the distance is daring
We both know how to drive

Weekends make up for the lost times that we've both apologized for
And I can't stand the fact that this extremity is the center of my day

I see where you're coming from
We've been on the same boat since day one
I see how you like to run
Back to the things that got you here

Although the distance is daring
We both know how to drive

Weekends make up for the lost times that we've both apologized for
And I can't stand the fact that this extremity is the center of my day

Mondays I sleep away
Tuesdays I lay awake
Wednesdays, they are the worst
Thursdays I reminice
Fridays I see your face
And I can't breathe

Although the distance is daring
I sure know what it's like to be alone---Lyrics submitted by abby.
