 love you one, a two, a three shoobee-doo
I love you four, that's more than I can afford
And I can tell some day that I'm gunna' say the truth
I love you five

I've been walking around
Trying to figure out
Why I am feeling all the feelings that I'm feeling now
And I got more on my mind
Then I've got on my plate

[clears throat]
I love you one, a two, a three shoobee-doo
I love you four, that's more than I can afford
And I can tell, some day that I'm gunna' say the truth

I love you five times more than any boy from before
'Cause all they really cared about was whether you put out
And I truly believe [Truly Believe]
That this love could be

And I could count five times off the top of my head
Where I sucked it in
Cause' you were hanging with him
And I got something to say
I Love You all the same

[X2]
I love you one, a two, a three shoobee-doo
I love you four, that's more than I can afford
And I can tell some day that I'm gunna' say the truth

I Love You, 5 ---Lyrics submitted by nick.
