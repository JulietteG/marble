It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
Romeo and Juliet
In the summer time it got
He was so fine
He blew my mind
My friends got tellin me
Girl, he a loser
But they can't see
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
Romeo and Juliet
Romeo and Juliet
Romeo and Juliet
Hello!
From the first time i saw his sides there was sunshine everytime
He walks into the room i feel my heart go Boom!Boom!Boom!
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
Romeo and Juliet
Romeo and Juliet
Romeo and Juliet
There was a time when i was young and i lips felt so strong
Now he comes back to me whats goin on
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me
It's a lot like Romeo and Juliet
It feels like somethin is happenin to me---Lyrics submitted by Cherry.
