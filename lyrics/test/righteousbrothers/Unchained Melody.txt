Oh, my love
my darling 
I've hungered for your touch 
a long lonely time 
and time goes by so slowly 
and time can do so much
are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love 
Godspeed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea,
to the sea 
to the open arms of the sea
lonely rivers sigh 'wait for me, wait for me' 
I'll be coming home wait for me 

Oh, my love
my darling 
I've hungered for your touch 
a long lonely time 
and time goes by so slowly 
and time can do so much
are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love 
Godspeed your love to me---Lyrics submitted by Hanna.
