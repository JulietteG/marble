Ive lived, Ive breathed, Ive stalled
Im falling on my knees
I fought the cold in capturing the seasons
Ive lost between the ember leaves

Ived hurt, Ive lied, Ive cursed
Nothing till I cry the ones we hurt
The most I hold you closest
And I just dont know why

So can you relight the fire
Relight the fire, relight the fire
Can you relight the fire
Relight the fire, relight the fire

Oooh Oooh

I dream, I run, I wait
Im crossing out the days to begin again
Ive fallen with a lover
And crashed the other side

Im big, Im weak, Im tall
Im learning what it means to fight for a cause
I dont know who I can be
But I know who I was

So can you relight the fire
Relight the fire, relight the fire
Can you relight the fire
Relight the fire, relight the fire
So can you relight the fire
Relight the fire, relight the fire

Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh

So can you relight the fire
Relight the fire, relight the fire
Can you relight the fire
Relight the fire, relight the fire

So can you relight the fire
Relight the fire, relight the fire
So can you relight the fire
Relight the fire, relight the fire---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
