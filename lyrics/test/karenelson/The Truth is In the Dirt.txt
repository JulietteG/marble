The truth is in the dirt on the ground
The truth is in the dirt on the ground
Not in your gilded cage with your rusted spoon
When the ground splits open it will swallow you

The truth is in the dirt on the ground
The truth is in the dirt on the ground
Not in your poison tongue or your acid tears
Let the truth howl in your ear

(Here she comes it killin time
Flames are burnin 
Behind her eyes)-(x2)

The truth is in the dirt on the ground
The truth is in the dirt on the ground
Not in your your close drawn out scratched till it bleeds
Knocked down dead gets what she needs

The truth is in the dirt on the ground
The truth is in the dirt on the ground
Not on a blazing 
From the midnight sun
The fire will turn your bones to dust

(Here she comes its killin time
Flames are burnin 
Behind her eyes)-(x2)

The truth is in the dirt on the ground
The truth is in the dirt on the ground
Not in your gilded cage 
with your rusted spoon
When the ground splits open it will swallow you---Lyrics submitted by haley.
