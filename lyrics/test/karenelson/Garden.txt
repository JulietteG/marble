I went down to the garden
Saw the trees and the skies of grey
You were there crying
For you knew that the seasons had changed

Once we danced to the moonlight
Shared a kiss to the rising sun
Every day was dying
Fleeting moments lost under the gun

And you asked me
Why does love fade
Into darkness
Cause we cannot change
We cannot change

I went down to the garden
Saw the trees and the skies of grey
You were there crying
Understood that the seasons had changed

Screamed out to the thunder
Held our hands up towards the night
Why did we fall under
Now the candles don't burn so bright

And you asked me
why does love fade
into darkness
cause we cannot change
we cannot change
[2x:]

I went down to the garden
Saw the trees and the skies of grey
You were there crying
For you knew that the seasons had changed---Lyrics submitted by hayley tegg.
