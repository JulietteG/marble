Eyes as grey as concrete
Lips as dry as sand
Anger is an ocean
We cannot see dry land
Another one dies its an eye for an eye
Keep on battling each other until were blind
If you could see my side
If I could see your side
I guess it wouldnt kill us at all just to give it a try

Open your heart surrender and enemies will be friends
You can find me right here
Raising up the white flag waiting for the war to end
Give me your hands remember that enemies were once friends
You can find me right here
Raising up the white flag waiting for the war to end

Silence is a glacier
Wait for it to melt
When the arrow hit you
Tell me how it felt
We were just small we were building a wall
Between us was a rift we were bound to fall
You see you hurt my pride but why did we fight?
Its been so long you know I cant even remember why

Gone is the winter
Lay our weapons down
For I surrender
Gone is the winter
Lay our weapons down
Alright?---
