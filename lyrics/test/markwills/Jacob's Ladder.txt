Jacob was a dirt poor farm boy
Raised at the fork in the road in a clamp poor house
Rachel was a land bearers daughter
Born with a silver spoon in her mouth

Her daddy said he wouldn't stand 
Rachel to waste her life with a common man
He tried hard to keep them apart
But you can't draw lines, in a young girls heart

So late one night by the harvest moon
Jacob climbed a latter up to Rachels room
He knew his place, it was right beside her
Step by step into her world
Head over heals for a brown eyed girl
But getting caught, didn't seem to matter
Cause heaven was waiting at the top, of Jacobs Ladder

It'll be five years September
Since her daddy found a ladder and a note on her window seal
Swore he'd never forgive them
Nothin melts a heart like a grandchild will

Now she climbs up on his knee
Says grandpa tell the story, the one about me
He thinks back and his eyes shine
Says listen child once upon a time

Late one night by the harvest moon
Daddy climbed a ladder to your mommas room
He knew his place it was right beside her
Step by step into her world 
Head over heals for my little girl
Here you are, thats all that matters
Cause heaven was waiting at the top, of Jacobs ladder
Oh an angle was waiting at the top, of Jacobs ladder---Lyrics submitted by Dusty Rottingha.
