I'm all alone
Holding on to memories while you're moving on
Let me take you back to
When we first said good bye
Cause I need you

I try because
All that i can do is hope that loves enough
To pull you close enough to hold you
I'll close my eyes
And I see you

Chorus:
Even when the sky falls and I've lost it all
I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I'll keep looking
Cause I know I will Find you there
You know I will find you
I'll find you
I'll find you there
You know I will find you
I'll find you
I'll find you there

So tell me why
Why you want a world between us
Let me try
I know you know this time I mean it
Say you still care and you need me

So where'd you go
Something in your voice that says you're not alone
Do you remember when I said I'll always be there
Believe me

Chorus:
Even when the sky falls and I've lost it all
I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I'll keep looking
Cause I know I'll find you there
You know I will find you
I'll Find you
I'll Find you there
You know I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you there

We're timeless
We're fearless
We're always gone
We're brilliant
We're broken
We're burned and on

Chorus:
Even when the sky falls and I've lost it all
I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I'll keep looking
Cause I know I will find you there
You know I will find you
I'll find you
I'll find you there
You know I will find you
I'll find you
I'll find you there

Even when the sky falls and I've lost it all
I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I'll keep looking
Cause I know I will find you there
You know I will find you
I'll find you
I'll find you there
You know I will find you
I'll find you
I'll find you there ---
