Check yes Juliet
Are you with me
Rain is falling
Down on the sidewalk
I won't go until you come outside

Check yes Juliet
Kill the limbo
I'll keep tossing
Rocks at your window
There's no turning back for us tonight

Lace up your shoes
A-O-A-O-ah
Here's how we do

Run baby run
Don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart
If you give them the chance
{Give them the chance}
Don't sell your heart
Don't say we're not
Meant to be
Run baby run
Forever we'll be
You and me

Check yes Juliet
I'll be waiting
Wishing, wanting
Yours for the taking
Just sneak out
And don't tell a soul goodbye

Check yes Juliet
Here's the countdown
3, 2, 1
Now fall in my arms now
They can change the locks
Don't let them change your mind

Lace up your shoes A-O-A-O-ah
Here's how we do

Run baby run
Don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart
If you give them the chance
{Give them the chance}
Don't sell your heart
Don't say we're not
Meant to be
Run baby run
Forever we'll be
You and me

We're flying through the night
We're flying through the night
Way up high
The view from here
Is getting better with
You by my side

Run baby run
Don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart
If you give them the chance
Don't sell your heart
Don't say we're not
Meant to be
Run baby run 
Forever will be

Run baby run
Don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart
If you give them the chance
{Give them the chance}
Don't sell your heart
Don't say we're not
Meant to be
Run baby run
Forever will be
You and me
You and me

You and me---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
