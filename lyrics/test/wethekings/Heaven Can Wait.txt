Here's a song for the nights
I think too much and
Here's a song when I
imagine us together

Here's a song for
when we talk too much
And I forget my words

Heaven can wait
up high in the sky
It's you and I

Heaven can wait deep
down in your eyes
I'm yours tonight

Lay your heart
next to mine
I feel so alive

Tell me you want me to
stay, forever
'Cause heaven can wait

Here's a song for the the
one who stole my heart
And ran so far, that
cupid couldn't catch her

Here's a song for the
kid who aims so high
He shot her down

Heaven can wait
up high in the sky
It's you and I

Heaven can wait deep
down in your eyes
I'm yours tonight

Lay your heart
next to mine
I feel so alive

Tell me you want me to
stay, forever
'Cause heaven can wait

Here's a song for the
nights I drink too much
And spill my words

Heaven can wait
up high in the sky
It's you and I

Heaven can wait deep
down in your eyes
I'm yours tonight

Lay your heart
next to mine
I feel so alive

Tell me you want me to
stay, forever
'Cause heaven can wait

'Cause heaven can
wait
Waaaaiiiitttt
