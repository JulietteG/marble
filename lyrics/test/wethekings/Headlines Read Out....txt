Stay for a moment and I will promise that I will be different and youll see me

Wait, wait and ill show you there is more to this is you listen and you soon believe 

Extra, extra hear me now

I am not the kind that will hide beneath the lights and lyrical one letters I cant stand the hype 

And Im not the kind at that will hide between the lines of love and faking it all for these 
Headlines read outwhoa 

Stay for a moment ill be the biggest bet with greater odds than you have ever seen 

Wait, wait some one stop me now cause I dont think I can hold this down for you youll see me 

Extra hear me now

 I am not the kind that will hide beneath the lights and lyrical one letters I cant stand the hype 

And Im not the kind at that will hide between the lines of love and faking it all for these 
Headlines read outwhoa 

Cant you see that this is proof you need
Cant you cant you see that this is what we all need

I am not the kind that will hide beneath the lights and lyrical one letters I cant stand the hype 

And Im not the kind at that will hide between the lines of love and faking it all for these 
Headlines read outwhoa---Lyrics submitted by catrina.
