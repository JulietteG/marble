Hooo ooooooh (x2)
Hooo La da da
Hooo ooooooh (x2)
Hooo La da da

Lately I've been thinking of someone
Someone who just makes me feel like myself.
That one who picks me up when I'm feeling blue.
And let's me do whatever I want to.
I gotta find that girl.

With every single dollar I'll be sure to buy you flowers
Cuz money ain't no problem when love's free.
Oh I'd trade in all my years to spend with you a single hour
As long as you'll spend it with me.

Hooo ooooooh (x2)
Hooo La da da

Lately You're the only one I see.
I can't seem to get you off of my mind. 
My darling pick me up because I'm falling.
Crazy madly in love with you.
I gotta find that girl. 

With every single dollar I'll be sure to buy you flowers
Cuz money ain't no problem when love's free.
Oh I'd trade in all my years to spend with you a single hour
As long as you'll spend it with me.

Run away with me and I will take you to the island.
Anywhere you wanna go I'm down.
We could build a rocket and fly up to every planet now.
We'll spin the world around.

With every single dollar I'll be sure to buy you flowers
Cuz money ain't no problem when love's free.
Oh I'd trade in all my years to spend with you a single hour
As long as you'll spend it 
As long as you'll spend it 
So come on and spend it with me.

Hooo ooooooh (x2)

Hooo ooooooh (x2)
Hooo La da da
La da!---Lyrics submitted by Avery Keller.
