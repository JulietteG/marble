If only you could hear the beat, beat, beat
of my beating heart
then maybe we, we, we
would never be apart
it's a beautiful sky on a beautiful day
but only you can stretch a smile across my face

So I'm waiting, waiting, waiting
for you to be calling, calling, calling
cause its another drive
another day on the road
and honey I don't have the strength for another show, no

And I got it almost figured out
if I could you closer to me
'cause it's a good life for a short time
(whoa oh, whoa oh)
and you've got me almost figured out
you're bringing out the best in me
you're bringing out the best in me

And it's a long way back to the golden state
where the city's held in by a golden gate
like a giant jar full of fireflies
the yellow lights blinking on the mountainside
and I wish I had a plane or a cable car
'cause all I really want is to be in your arms

And I got it almost figured out
if I could you closer to me
'cause it's a good life for a short time
and you've got me almost figured out
there's almost nothing left to see
you're bringing out the best in me
you're bringing out the best in me

whoa oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh..
oh oh oh oh oh oh..
oh oh oh oh oh oh..
[x4]

And I've got it almost figured out
if I could you closer to me
'cause it's a good life for a short time
and you've got me almost figured out
(you've got me almost figured out)
you're bringing out the best in me
you're bringing out the best in me...
you're bringing out the best in me...

whoa oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh.. 
[x2]

you're bringing out the best in me...
(you've got me almost figured out..)
you're bringing out the best in me...
(you've got me almost figured out..)---Lyrics submitted by julie.
