Verse one:
Hop on a fast train out of town
Downside up and upside down
Going fast is going slow
What could have been wee'll never know
In this place that has no name
I cant remember why i came
Then i hear you whisper low
One more mile to jericho
Nothings ever what it seems
When you live inside your dreams

Chourus:
The walls will tumble
The walls will tumble
But im not gonna cry
My heart wont crumble
My heart wont crumble
If we ever say goodbye

Verse two:
Everybody gets the joke
Where's the fire?
Where's the smoke?
Money, love, and jealousy
Something's got a hold on me
But i will follow where yoou go
One more mile to jericho

Chourus:
The walls will tumble
The walls will tumble
But im not gonna cry
My heart wont crumble
My heart wont crumble
If we ever say goodbye
Goodbye now
Goodbye

Verse three:
One more mile
One more kiss
One more word
One more wish
And love will save us
This i know
From this place called jericho

Chourus: [2x]
The walls will tumble
The walls will tumble
But im not gonna cry
My heart wont crumble
My heart wont crumble
If we ever say goodbye

If we ever say goodbye [4x]

Goodbye. [2x]---Lyrics submitted by Miranda.
