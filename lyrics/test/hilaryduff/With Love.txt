(VERSE ONE)
I don't mind you telling me what's been on your mind lately
I don't mind you speaking up
I know sometimes I can be all wrapped up and into me
I can be in such a rush

(BRIDGE)
Just slow me down, slow me down
Tell me tomorrow everything will be around
Just slow me down, slow me down
You're the one who keeps me on the ground

(CHORUS)
Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You could even be blunt
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love.

(VERSE TWO)
I can take your honesty, all your words weigh heavily
Listening to you all the time (all the time)
I wanna be there for you, the way you've been there for me
Always help me walk the line (walk the line)

(BRIDGE)
Just slow me down, slow me down
I know you will always be around

(CHORUS)
Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You could even be blunt
Just do it with love, love, love, love


You could tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do it with love, love, love, love

(MIDDLE-EIGHT)
All this time we finally know each other
Now that I've been leaning on your shoulder
I can tell you baby that
You're right, when you're right
You're wrong, when you're wrong
And I can be weak 'cause I know you'll be strong

(CHORUS)
Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You could even be blunt
Just do it with love, love, love, love
You could tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do it with love, love, love, love

Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You could even be blunt
Just do it with love, love, love, ,love
You could tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love.

Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love.

Just do it with love.---Lyrics submitted by Aayushi.
