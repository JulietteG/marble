Hot sweats in cold sweaters
I feel a little lost since you've been gone
The blame helps you feel better
Until you run across the cloud I'm on

You're reaching for a hand that's in the past
And beaches where the sand has turned to glass
Your television life couldn't channel this love

You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
And now I'm wishing you were here
As much as I wish you would disappear
So will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
Can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
And will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)

A life boat in dead water
A ship inside, a battle that we broke
And we lost our true colours
We opened every door until we closed

And I could feel you in my air tonight
Coming through the waves in satellites
But our city skies will never light up

You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
And now I'm wishing you were here
As much as I wish you would disappear
So will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
Can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
And will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)

Hot sweats in cold sweaters
I feel a little lost since you've been gone---
