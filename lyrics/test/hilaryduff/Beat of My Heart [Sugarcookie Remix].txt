To the beat of my,
to the beat of my,
the beat of my heart

I'm thinking about letting it out
i wanna give in, i wanna go out
been looking around, i finally found
the rhythm of love, the feeling of sound

it's making a change the feeling is strange
it's coming right back, right back in my range 
no worries about, anything else

I'm waking up 
To the beat of my,
to the beat of my,
the beat of my heart

(Chorus)
The beat of heart,
the beat of my heart
the beat of my heart it tears us apart
The beat of my heart,
the beat of my heart
the beat of my heart now I'm back to the start.

To the beat of my,
to the beat of my,
the beat of my heart

I'm up from my down, I turn it around
I'm making it back, I'm not gonna drown
I'm taking a stance, I won't miss a chance
I want you to see, I'm not scared to dance.

The way that you feel could never be real
I want you to know I finished the deal
So I'm saying to you I'll always to be true to the rhythm inside

To the beat of my,
to the beat of my,
the beat of my heart

The beat of heart,
the beat of my heart,
the beat of my heart it tears us apart
The beat of my heart,
the beat of my heart
the beat of my heart now I'm back to the start.

To the beat of my,
to the beat of my,
the beat of my heart

Away, Away, Away, Away,

Away, Away Away Away

Away, Away, Away, Away,

Away, Away Away Away

The beat of heart,
the beat of my heart
the beat of my heart it tears us apart

The beat of heart,
the beat of my heart
the beat of my heart it tears us apart
The beat of my heart,
the beat of my heart
the beat of my heart now I'm back to the start.

Away, Away, Away, Away,

Away, Away Away Away

To the beat of my,
to the beat of my,
the beat of my heart---Lyrics submitted by Katie.
