[Hilary:]
Mood is right 
Spirits up
we're here tonight
and thats enough

Simply having a wonderful christmas time
Simply having a wonderful christmas time

The party's on
The feeling here
It's all because
It's time of year

Simply having a wonderful christmas time
Simply having a wonderful christmas time

[Choir:]
a wonderful christmas time
(a wonderful christmas time)
a wonderful christmas time
(a wonderful christmas time)

The choir of children sing their song

They practice all night long

[Choir:]
Ding Dong 
Ding Dong
Ding dong

[Hilary:]
the word is out
about the town
to lick your glass
I dont doubt

Simply having a wonderful christmas time
simply having a wonderful christmas time

Mood is right 
Spirits up
we're here tonight
and thats enough

Simply having a wonderful christmas time
simply having a wonderful christmas time
Simply having a wonderful christmas time
simply having a wonderful christmas time

Simply having a wondeful christmas time

[Choir:]
Simply having a wonderful christmas time
