Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa

I declare war on love
I declare war on love
Finally I'm burning the pages
And I declare a war on love
And it's not fair to put the blame on you
It's not fair to just blame you
I kept denying the sound of the sirens
So it's not fair to just blame you

For too long I played the pretender
But now I'll never surrender

I need it rain-rain-raining diamonds
I need the planets all aligning
I know that love is more than just surviving
I need it raining diamonds
Whoa whoa whoa...

I'm not scared, a little reckless maybe
Till I hold it in my hands
And when I fall madly deeply
I wanna fall and never land

I need it rain-rain-raining diamonds
I need the planets all aligning
I know that love is more than just surviving
I need it raining diamonds
Whoa whoa whoa...

I've heard it heard it heard it
All the lines and the imperfections
The perfect words are worthless
I'd rather go it alone
Whoa whoa whoa...

I need it rain-rain-raining diamonds
I need the planets all aligning
I know that love is more than just surviving
I need it raining diamonds
I need it raining whoa
Whoa whoa whoa...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
