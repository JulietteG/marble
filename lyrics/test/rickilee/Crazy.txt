I wanna see you getting nasty on the floor
Cuz the beat's vibrating through the floor
Throw your hands up in the air and dance some more

I wanna see you getting crazy, gimme more

Everybody on the floor
Ooo
I wanna see you jumping
Oooo
Cuz it's a party going on
Oooo
So everybody just go go go go go go go

Feel all over your body
Ain't no need to worry, tonight let's just party
Go crazy oooo
Feel all over your body
Ain't no need to worry, tonight let's just party
Go crazy oooo
Feel, take over your party
From the tip of your fingers
Right down through to your toes and shake it off and let it go
Oooo
Go crazy, go crazy
Oooo
Feel me, just feel me
Oooo
Go crazy, go crazy

Every grab somebody, make it hot
Flashing lights, action, you're a superstar
I like it like, show me, show me what you got
Cuz you're sexy and you know it's getting hot

Everybody on the floor
