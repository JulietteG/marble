All we need is love
All we need is love
Wanna shout it from the rooftops,
All we need is love!

I feel the LOVE under the stars, on the rooftop tonight
Here we come together AS ONE, can act by a beating heart
All around the world,
I'm coming now to you
A revolution of love,
Here we go, go, goooo!

All we need is love
All we need is love
Wanna shout it from the rooftops,
All we need is love!

Follow the LIGHTS all of the way,
On the freeway of love
We got it all if we got each other
And everything will be ALRIGHT!
All around the world,
I'm coming now to you
A revolution of LOVE
Here we go, go, gooo

All we need is love
All we need is love
Wanna shout it from the rooftops
All we need is LOVE!
We're on a one way ticket to Paradise
I'll kick it out the doors, and come alive
All we need is love
All we need is love!!

From the ground up, let's start a revolution of love!

All we need is love
All we need is love
Wanna shout it from the rooftops
All we need is LOVE!
We're on a one way ticket to Paradise
I'll kick it out the doors, and come alive
All we need is love
All we need is LOVE!!

From the ground up, let's start a revolution of love!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
