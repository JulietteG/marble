She's got a little house in town
I sometimes go around, there
To see her
And she let me deep inside
I sing her love songs
But shell turn them blind
Like she ain't the sentimental type
I keep my heart in my pocket and I hold
I hold it tight

I know that she don't mind if I,
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if Im absent through it all

I know that she don't mind if I,
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if Im absent through it all
Na, Through it all
Oh oh oh oh, Through it all

Her skin is softer than the bluest eyes
With the warmth that I need
Gives me a place
To hide from the streetlights burning through the bedroom window
In the shadows yeah there's loneliness we cling to
When the morning comes
We'll go, we'll go our separate ways
Ain't no magic my dear, ain't no reason to stay

I know that she don't mind if I,
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if Im absent through it all

I know that she don't mind if I,
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if Im absent through it all
Na, Through it all
Oh oh oh oh, Through it all

And we fall through empty corridors
And we talk in useless metaphors
Yeah we fall through empty corridors
And we talk in useless metaphors
And we fall through empty corridors
And we talk in useless metaphors

Only cause we're lonely (repeated)---Lyrics submitted by Mirjam Happel.
