Hold it in love
The river in your mouth is pouring out
Water takes the
Shape of all that it surrounds
Yeah I know
I've been trying so hard to keep in time
With all of the hours in your day

Hold it in babe
Who let you out among the crowd?
Not like that
These streets will tear you down
How it is
Under my skin, now you are
Pictures of all you'll ever be

Oh I am not myself
Today
I am not feeling
Okay

Hold it in love
The river in your mouth is pouring out
Water takes the
Shape of all that it's around
Yeah I know
I been trying so hard to keep in time
With all of the sounds that you make
Hold it in babe
Come at you from both sides of your mind
Thick and thin these
Walls you'll always stand behind
Are sick and tired
Oh I beg for the world to change
But it don't
No it ain't all you and that's the thing

Oh I am not myself
Today
I am not feeling
Okay

And you
Showed me hope amidst the harlequins in spring
And you
Told me life was learning how to be your friend---
