Down through the years the young men came west to play the game in Dodger Blue.
Through laughter and tears the young men came west and rose to fame in Dodger Blue.
And they stayed and they played and they made a dream come true.
So here's to the dream and here's to the team
In Los Angeles Dodger Blue.

from smokey Walt Alston
to sweet sweet Lou.
They all wore Dodger Blue.
Los Angeles Dodger Blue.

Some came up for just a cup of coffee.
While others stayed for many a season through.
But they all had a dream and they all made the team.
And they all wore Dodger Blue.

And they stayed and they played and they made a dream come true. 
So here's to the dream and here's to the team
In Los Angeles Dodger Blue.---Lyrics submitted by Joe Mrotzek.
