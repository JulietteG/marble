My truck bed cargo light
Is her spotlight any night of the week
Just crank the radio
Slide the rear glass and let her go

Ohhh I think its in her genes
Born a red light on the verge of green
Cause when shes feelin that beat, oh she's gonna

Dance, dance, dance
All night to the music
Move, move, yeah
Every move shes makin me lose it
All the girl wants to do is groove it
What her momma gave her shes gonna use it
Every time that she gets the chance
Yeah shes gonna dance, dance, dance

First thing slow it down
Make a little room drop the tailgate down
She dont mind puttin on a show
When nobody aint around nobody's gonna know

Oh and that lakeside fog
Fireflies shining for a disco ball
DJ keep spinnin those songs
Cause she's gonna

My truck bed cargo light
Is her spotlight, any night of the week
Just crank the radio

Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance---
