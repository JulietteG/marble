Wake up, wake up, wake up
Im alone its calling me again
Can you hear it,
or am I just acting strange
Its all that ever plays
Its the soundtrack to my brain,
telling me Im always wrong
But Im never going to change
And you worry
that youre not good enough
So you think and you drink
And you think and you drink
Now its coming back
It never goes away
Can you hear it, can you hear it
Here it comes again
It never goes away
Its just a part of me
It never goes away 
Its all that ever plays

Im fighting with my myself again,
Im fighting with myself again
But Im never going to change.---Lyrics submitted by Kristin.
