Im still running 33s up underneath this truck
Even though rush hour concrete is the only place Im getting stuck
Aint on the farm no more but on a stretch of sunny days
I still catch myself looking up at the sky
Praying for a little rain.

No I cant outrun these roots
Even if I wanted to
Cause they run too strong, run too deep
Cutting right through the heart of me
No it dont matter where I plant these boots
Cant outrun these roots
I cant outrun these roots.

Theres still that back-home part of me, that cant help but see things a little differently
Like how there aint no need to put a G on the end of huntin or fishin
And I still got granddaddys bible, his old rifle and his name
But I also got his pour a little more
Coarsin through my veins.

Thank God I cant
Theyre tangled up in every part of who I am
Without em I know I dont stand a chance
I cant outrun these roots.---
