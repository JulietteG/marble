Im leaving all my broken records with you
I hope you, you can find the time
to look them through
And show me, the one thats on your mind
And I will promise to it play like new
Wasted.
and she cant seem to take this anymore
Im pushed away and I leave her crying,
shes crying on the floor
This uneasiness is beginning to seem
a lot too familiar
And she cant seem to let it all go
Because theres problems in her mind
That I cant seem to loose
So its over now, but Im

Im leaving all my broken records with you
I hope you, you can find the time
to look them through
And show me the one thats on your mind
And I will promise to make it play like new

Im trying, but I never meant
to treat you that way
Cause Im without you,
left with errors of my ways	
And when I close my eyes,
I still see your face
Over and over
Because theres problems in your mind
that I cant seem to loose
So its over now.

Cause Ive been thinking about
how youve been
Have you cut me out,
where do I stand with you
And Ive been thinking about
how you felt next to me---Lyrics submitted by Kristin.
