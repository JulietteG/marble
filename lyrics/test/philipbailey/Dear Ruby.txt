Ruby, My Dear
Hold back that tear 
I know he's gone 
Your love has flown 
You are all alone 
I know you cry 
There's no reply 
Pain lingers on 
It doesn't go 
Cause you'll say so 

One day he came to you 
Made the music play 
His way 
You said you'd rather die 
Than to say goodbye
Than to say goodbye

But there'll come a day
Though he's away 
You'll sing his song 
You'll carry on 
Ruby, My Dear 

One day he came to you 
Made the music play 
 His way 
You said you'd rather die 
Than to say goodbye

Ruby My Dear
Dear Ruby
Ruby My Dear
Hold back that tear
Ruby my Dear
Dear Ruby
Ruby my Dear
Oooooo hold back the tear
Ruby my Dear
Your love has flown
Ruby my Dear
Youre all alone
Ooooooooo
I know you cry
Ruby my Dear
Oooooo Theres no reply
Oooooooo Ruby
My Dear
Ruby my Dear
Oooooooooo
Ruby My Dear
Oooooooooo
