Walking on the Chinese 
Walking on the Chinese wall
Watching for the coins to
Watching for the coins to fall

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Butterfly spread your painted wings 
For an answer from the Ching
By the stream stretching in the rocks
Tiger on the mountaintop

Walking on the Chinese wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Now the sun is rising in the east
Looking for my golden fleece
Ivory skin scarlet color deep
Lips that burn but do not speak

Three misty nights waiting by the shore 
Maybe that my lover comes no more
Red chamber dream from the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden Chinese love

On the Chinese wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Blue red silk burning on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Stepping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me

Come down the clouds to the sea of flames
From the mountain hear the cry of pain
Red chamber dream from the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden Chinese love

On the Chinese wall
Watching for the coins to fall

On the Chinese wall (oh yeah)
Watching for the coins to fall

On the Chinese wall 
spread your wings for an answer from the Ching
Go to sleep but not to rest
watching for the coins to fall
Watching for the coins to fall---Lyrics submitted by Patti Smith.
