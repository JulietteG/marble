They say love can take you far
Be yourself and there you are
Once in a lifetime
When will she be mine heaven knows
Love can take you
Up the mountains down below
Day or night she won't let go
Love's like a warm wind, sworn to the feeling, need to know

What does it feel like
When can I say
It's the furthest that I've ever been
And I've found a way
What does it sound like
When will I know
How does it feel like letting go
A memory of - I only know how to love

When I dream I'm in her arms
Feeling safe and far from harm
She knows where I've been
Places that I've seen
Need to know
Heaven tell me

What does it feel like
When can I say
It's the furthest that I've ever been
And I've found a way
What does it sound like
When will I know
How does it feel like letting go
A memory of - i only know how to love

Deep down inside
She's here tonight by my side

What does it sound like
When will I know
How does it feel like letting go
A memory of-I only know how to love

I only know how to love---Lyrics submitted by Zach O.
