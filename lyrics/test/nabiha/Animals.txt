I'm just busy dancing
I'm the boss man, I'm the head of the committee
Lay the love dong, got the keys to the city
Looking so sharp, I come like a machete
Done 12 rounds and I still look pretty

B-o-s-s m-a-n, listen to me now,
I'mma spell it out again
B-o-s-s m-a-n, like what you see
Come around, you're my friend
I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy

I like it loud and I like it raw
Hey pretties, what you're waiting for?
Run wild like animals
Turn it up till it overloads
I wanna feel those speakers blow
Run wild like animals
And we gonna start a riot
A riot,
Yeah, we gonna start a riot tonight
I like it loud and I like it raw
Hey pretties, what you're waiting for?
Run wild like animals
I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy dancing

I'mma get down, and get gitty
When you're aching 'cause the beat get sicky
See the golden ticking now
Gimme, gimme, gimme

Ripping it and jacking it
30 fingers grabbing it
I'mma razzle dazzle it
On my prettiest driving shit
I get you popping, make your body go ape
I get you popping, make your body go ape

I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy

I like it loud and I like it raw
Hey pretties, what you're waiting for?
Run wild like animals
Turn it up till it overloads
I wanna feel those speakers blow
Run wild like animals
And we gonna start a riot
A riot,
Yeah, we gonna start a riot tonight
I like it loud and I like it raw
Hey pretties, what you're waiting for?
Run wild like animals
I'm just busy dancing
I'm just busy dancing---
