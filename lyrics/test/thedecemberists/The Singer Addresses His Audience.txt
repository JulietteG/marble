We know we know we belong to ya
We know you build your life around us
And would we change? We had to change some
We know, we know, we belong to ya
We know you threw your arms around us
In the hopes we wouldnt change
But we had to change some
We know we belong to ya

Were aware that youve cut your hair
In a style that our drummer wore in the video
But with fame came a mountain claim for the evermore
You know, so when youre bridal processional is a televised confession
To the benefit of Axe shampoo, you know we did it for you
We did it all for you

We know we know we belong to ya
We know you build your life around us
And would we change? We had to change some
We know, we know, we belong to ya
We know you threw your arms around us
In the hopes we wouldnt change
But we had to change some
Ya know we belong to ya
Ya know to belong to you
Ya know to belong to you
To belong to belong to belong
To belong to belong to belong
To belong to belong to belong
To belong to belong to belong---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
