[Chorus:] 
I am a boy from the high country 
And I got a lil love for the offering 

[Verse:] 
I come down from the mountains, bow to the sea 
In Carolina Low I will carry thee 
Gonna take you up, gonna take you around 
Where your poor lil Pan lays, we'll drag him down 
Did you crack your laugh? Did you skin your knee? 
In Carolina Low I will carry thee 

[Verse 2:] 
What is sealed with a handshake - spoiled with a kiss 
You got an ugly lil mouth, boy, and it's come to this 
I'm bound for the hilltop, gonna make it, please 
In Carolina Low I will carry thee 

[Chorus:] 
I am a boy from the high country 
And I got a lil love for the offering 
And I got a lil love for the offering 
And I got a lil love for the offering---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
