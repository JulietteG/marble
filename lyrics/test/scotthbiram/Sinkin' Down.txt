Some day some how Im gonna make it go away
I been chasin these same old dreams around seems like forever and a day.
Slippin down an old road again seems like I been this way before.

This same old storys like an old broken record all the edges of my memories are worn.

Steppin out, and fallin down through all the misery and sin

Im sinkin fast in this old quicksand ground wish I could remember, what I had to do to live

Just like I did when I still had a handful of friends hey!

On the dawn theres a, brand new horizon it couldnt be any worse than yesterday.

Still in your heart its just, one more tomorrow you gotta keep on, beatin down the day.

I keep starin up at the judge, who says he wont let me find my way hey!

Steppin out, and fallin down through all the feel good and pain.

You take me in and you, spit me out drag it out just like a ball and chain.

Would you believe some of my so called best friends, dont even know my name yeah!

Some day some how Im gonna make it go away.

I been chasin these same old dreams around seems like forever and a day.---Lyrics submitted by blabla.
