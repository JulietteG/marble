You don't even know me
You don't even care
I've got something for you
You must this beware
Don't say that it's over
I'm still a part of you
Our love is eternal
Hope in tomorrow's world
Your life's getting closer
Will you make the grade
Slowly going nowhere
Will you die afraid?
Everybody dies---Lyrics submitted by elien.
