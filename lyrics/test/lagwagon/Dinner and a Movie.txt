Here we go again
Until one of us says when
Making old mistakes
The brake lights illuminate
Accidents repeat
You can count on me
Crushing you in vain
'Cause I will save you
You can hate me

We're so well adjusted, darling
it's pathetic justice

Find out where I breathe
Suffocate my needs
Van Gogh kept his ears
But I will love you
You won't save me

We're so well adjusted, darling
it's pathetic justice

It's already better than last time I ruined another girl's life
I am a portrait of serenity and desperate need
I'll hold you here until you cannot breathe

If I break up with you
You'll find someone new
So I'll choose misery
And I will save you
You can hate me

They'll all be disgusted, darling
it's poetic
it's pathetic justice---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
