I've already come to terms
with bridges I have burned
We all make mistakes

We keep preparing for the worst
So we won't seem adverse
Just like we rehearsed

Click, two, three
heartbreaking music
So close to loss we use it

How much honesty's healthy
Say what's on your mind
The only way to be

Drugs are only for dessert
do your homework first
We do not administer the cure for that thirst

Cause it's always been heartbreaking music
so close to death we use it
(killing)

writing this over and over
it'll never mend

I am the jest malignant cell
playwright to your hell
I think I knew you well

But I wish I were as smart as you
I could have changed your mind
Would have, should have, the question 'til I die 

But it's always been heartbreaking music
so close to life we abuse it
(killing)---Lyrics submitted by Barbara.
