I know it's hard to tell how mixed up you feel 
hoping what you need is behind every door 
each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change 
because everyone has hopes, you're human after all 
the feeling sometimes, wishing you were someone else 
feeling as though you never belong 
this feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy 
I truly understand. Please, don't cry now 

Please don't go, I want you to stay 
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here 
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel 
the world is just illusion trying to change you 

being like you are 
well this is something else, who would comprehend? 
but some that do, lay claim that 
divine purpose blesses them 
that's not what I believe. It doesn't matter anyway. 
a part of your soul ties you to the next world 
or maybe to the last, I'm still not sure 
What I do know is, to us the world is different 
as we are to the world but I guess you would know that  

Please don't go, I want you to stay 
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here 
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel 
the world is just illusion trying to change you 

Please don't go, I want you to stay 
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here 
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel 
the world is just illusion trying to change you---Lyrics submitted by tracy.
