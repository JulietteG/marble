I'll find a way
I'll search in every direction
I refuse to believe that this path is mine 

Worry free i go on, go on, go on
Step back, i know your name
Humor me, humor me 
And release the facts
Tell me why we're here
Cause i dont want to know what you live for

The traffic is blocking the exits
Get me out of here
And re-wash my brain through my ears
Re-wash my brain through my ears..oh! 
There is another highway that no one knows of
The lanes exist, the lanes exist

We are an empire 
Lied to about failure
Knowing only one, 
Knowing only one way to reach the future

These directions are headed to my dead end
(who are they to plan our every move?)
Ad i'll save myself while i still can, 
I think i still can
Not every step leads to another
I'm standing but i'm not breathing

My lungs are failing me
My lungs are failing me

The messenger, 
The messenger lies through his teeth

Brakes cut into rubber (as i see flames) 
Sailing the roadside
Heroes emerge from men (as they rush to the scene)
I fled the scene (fled the scene)
Two crashes and you can bet i am not one of them...---Lyrics submitted by !abby!.
