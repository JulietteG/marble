let's hope we call to them
our dreams and our fears
we'll reach out our arms
to try to find something to love
there's always something to love
you'll reach out your arms
and find something you love
i swear, i swear you'll find it

i swear we all have it in us
and right now it's all we have
this is your lifesaver
this is your lifesaver
this is, this is your lifesaver
this is, this is your calling

when the water is pulling you in
look to the clear skies above
when the water is pulling you in
take a deep breath
take a deep breath before you submerge

i swear we all have it in us
and right now its all we have
this is your lifesaver
this is your lifesaver
i swear, i swear we all have it in us
i swear, i swear we all have it in us

let's hope we call to them
our dreams and our fears
we'll reach out our arms
and find something to love

we open our eyes to stare at the sun
our ambitions should keep us turned away
our hearts will show the way

i swear we all have it in us
and right now it's all we have
this is your lifesaver
this is your lifesaver
stay awake
but don't stop dreaming
promise me you won't stop dreaming
stay awake
believe me when i say,
believe me when i say it's worth it
stay awake---Lyrics submitted by John.
