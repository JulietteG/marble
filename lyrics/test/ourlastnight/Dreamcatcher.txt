The wind carries dreams like they're feathers
While they're falling like a safe
I'm saving like a safe
Kiss the conscious while i kill the king

Can't we find a safe place to put ourselves?
We can't turn around, we can't turn around
We were hanging by a thread
That wouldn't give in (wouldn't give in) 
With a new set of arms the sky is reach

Opportunity rises as we close our eyes
We close our eyes, now we're living
Now we're living what was in the back of our minds
Now or never could be our last decision
So pull our dreams from our sleep
Kiss the conscious while i kill the king

Can't we find a safe place to put ourselves?
We can't turn around, we can't turn around
We were hanging by a thread 
That wouldn't give in (wouldn't give in)
With a new set of arms the sky is reach

Kiss the conscious while i kill the king

Can't we find a safe place to put ourselves?
To put ourselves
We were hanging by a thread
That wouldn't give in, wouldn't give in

We were hanging by a thread 
That wouldn't give in
Kiss the conscious
Kill the king
Kiss the conscious
Kill the..

We've struck gold where we wanted it to be
This is the fortune we've  found---Lyrics submitted by !abby!.
