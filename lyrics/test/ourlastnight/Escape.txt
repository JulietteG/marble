i hope you're comfortable
just sit down, sit down
where to start, i have no idea
we'll try to find shelter from this pouring rain
i think i see it
home isn't where you make it anymore

who would have thought we'd make it this far
now i don't know where to go

so i'll escape, escape to where i need to be
the water's getting higher and i need to breath
where do we go now, i'll ask you once again
with our lungs gone, our lives are gone

open up my chest, you'll find no heart for this
curiosity has taken over my insides
eating away at my bones
when does this end

who would have thought we'd make it this far
now i don't know where to go

so i'll escape, escape to where i need to be
the water's getting higher and i need to breath
where do we go now, ill ask you once again
with our lungs gone, our lives are gone

where do we go now
the windshield crashes in and our memory starts to sprint away
the dust kicks up and our site is gone, oh, i didn't know

show me that were living
show me what we're made of
show me where to go---Lyrics submitted by John.
