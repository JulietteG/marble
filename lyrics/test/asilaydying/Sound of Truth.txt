[Chorus]
We have all heard what we wanted to hear
"Truth" that sounds right to our ears

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
But what wisdom is there within us
To live based on the feeling of our hearts
How many times has instinct let us down
Never to be thought through
Never to be questioned
Say what you really mean
When your ambition calls you (calls you)
For what use is there, is there in praying
If you will only hear what you want to hear?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
We speak of fighting to resist this world
But what about the battle within us?
If we have chosen to live against the grain
Then why are we all facing the same way?
There is no difference between us and them
If we all blindly seek truth from sentiments

[Chorus] 3x---Lyrics submitted by Kory.
