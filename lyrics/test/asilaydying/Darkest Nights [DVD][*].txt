For so long I have felt alone
Content to live with unrest
Longing faded into countless nights
That buried my weary heart
But You brought an end
To this dead hour
And meaning to a calloused life

Held in Your arms
But too far from my heart

These thoughts will carry me through
The darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in

These thoughts will carry me through
The darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in mine

I remember the way You looked at me
And the way You drew
Dew me cose
With one deep sigh
Scattering pieces of my
My restless mind
Forgetting all that we have left behind

We have left behind
We have left behind
We have left behind

These thoughts will carry me through
The darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in

These thoughts will carry me through
The darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in

These thoughts will carry me through
The darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in

These thoughts will carry me through
The darkest nights
While Your eyes rest in---Lyrics submitted by jj.
