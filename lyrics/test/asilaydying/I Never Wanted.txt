I never wanted
And I never cared before

I never wanted
And I never cared before
Take it back
This is a new day

I never wanted
And I never cared before
Take it back
This is 

How I long to regress
To the days before I took upon myself
The obsession of this world (for tomorrow)
A day of innocence equating beauty (may fall)
For tomorrow may fall (and today)
And today is already (is already gone)

Tomorrow may fall
Today is already gone

Take it back
This is a new day

I never wanted, this is a new day
And I never cared before
I never wanted, I never wanted
And I never cared before

I've grown tired of chasing
Convinced I was in need
And now the years I've spent
Only a slave to this

Tomorrow may fall
And today is already gone
I will no longer adore these things
That will never satisfy me

I've seen my world change
And then go back to where it came

In this vicious circle
We are all brought back to life
Only to die
In this vicious circle
We are all brought back to life
Only to die (again)

In this vicious circle (I've seen my)
We are all (my world change)
Brought back to life (and then go back)
Only to die (back to where it came)
In this vicious circle (but without these)
We are all (barren obsessions)
Brought back to life (I am simply)
Only to die again (I am simply free)

I've seen my world change
And then go back to where it came---Lyrics submitted by Olivier.
