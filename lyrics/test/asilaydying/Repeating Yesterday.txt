[computer voice]
this is what i am
this is what i have become
repeating yesterday
drain me of my very essence
to form again what lasts
this is what i am
this is what i have become
repeating yesterday
drain me of my very essence

[screamo]
this is what i am
this is what i have become
what is love without sacrifice
my tears hold no weight
if my commitment is only failure
repeat yesterday
each day i am born again to be
a child in the eyes of love
repeating yesterday
repeating...
drain me of my very essence
to form again what lasts

this is what i am
this is what i have become
what is love without
what is love, without
