Even though I know it's wrong
It's time for us to get back home
Where have all the hours gone
I'd hate for you to be alone
Let's play scissors, paper, stone

Now there's only us two left
We lost a few good men on the way
Started out as quite a crowd
Let tomorrow wait another day
Let tomorrow wait another day

Didn't we all have such a good time?
Didn't we all have the greatest night
The greatest night, the greatest night?

(Live the night you can remember)
(Live the night you can remember)

Didn't we all have such a good time?
Didn't we all have the greatest night
The greatest night, the greatest life?

(You don't know what you do to me)
(You don't know what you do to me)

Here's the sunrise, how the time flies
Even though I know it's wrong
I know there's time for one more song
Let's play scissor paper stone
Let's play scissor paper stone---
