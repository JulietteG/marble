Forget the (facts?)
Forget the fighting
I have to trust
Trust my own truth
The gunshots chatter
The windows rattle
But all I can think about
Is you

All I ever wanted
Was to give my life to you
When we'd fly away together
High into the brightest blue

Behind these walls
Behind these whispers
I have to keep
Keep on breathing
Beyond this noise
Beyond these feelings
I have to keep believing
Someone's there

All I ever wanted
Was to spend my time with you
And we'd dream (you off?) together
You out of me, me out of you

All I ever wanted
Was to give my life to you
When we'd fly away together
High into the brightest blue
High into the brightest blue
High into the brightest blue---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.
