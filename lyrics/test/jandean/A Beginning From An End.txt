She looks like you in every way,
and I love her more with each passing day.

But that doesnt mean, I dont miss you.
Miss the way she cries
Miss you
Miss those wavy eyes	
Miss you
Miss her tender sighs
But that doesnt mean, I dont miss you

She reminds me of the morning,
when you left me without warning.
But that doesnt mean, I dont miss you.

Whenever Im holding her near,
I seem to sense your presents here.
I even get the feeling that I could reach out and touch your hand

She waits each morning, smiling bright.
She takes my hand and shell squeeze it tight.

But that doesnt mean, I dont miss you.
Miss the way she cries
Miss you
Miss those wavy eyes	

I could still remember that stifling antiseptic smell,
Of the hospital corridor
As you clutched my hand and hurried down the hall,
I think you knew as you looked up at me
that we would never see each other again.
And I felt so all alone as they wheeled you out the doors and told me to wait.
And then there was a cry.
And the doctor came out and showed me our baby girl.
You never saw her sweetheart,
but she must of known you somewhere,
Because she looks, and acts, and talks the way I remember you.

(Repeat 5x)
But that doesnt mean, I dont miss you.
Miss the way she cries
Miss you.
Miss those wavy eyes	
Miss you.
Miss her tender sighs---Lyrics submitted by tim k.
