Hawaii's got two or three of my good years

Hawaii
Is where I'm goin' from L.A.
Hawaii
Is the place I'd rather stay
The summer's vacation to the sea
I'll hop a plane that will fly just for me

Hawaii's got two or three of my good years

Hawaii
Is where I left my girlfriend
Hawaii
d
Riding 'round on our new motorcycle

Hawaii's got two or three of my good years

I'll grab my surfboard, make it to the sand
Take the waves, no matter how I land
Following wherever they will lead me

Radios blarin', people do love how
KPOI's always playin' music now
Rock 'n Roll blastin' all around me

Hawaii
I'm headin' back to find my life
Hawaii
On our isle of paradise
In evening the sun will set
And we will sleep, then release, and we'll find peace

Hawaii's got two or three of my good years---Lyrics submitted by Tim Kann.
