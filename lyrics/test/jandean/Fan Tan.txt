Fan Tan, Fan Tan, Tan Tan

Cruisin' Sunset's quite a trip
Whiskey's magic for the hip
But a strange thing I did find
Leaving trails of rainbow wrappers behind
I couldn't get her from my mind

Fan Tan in my I hand
You understand I do prefer
Once you try it you will find
The original perfume flavor

Fan Tan, Fan Tan, Fan Tan

Picked her up in my Stingray
Brought her home with me to stay
Though I know it seems absurd
While the flavor lasts she won't say a word
And all I've ever heard her say

Fan Tan in my I hand
You understand I do prefer
Once you try it you will find
The original perfume flavor

Fan Tan, Fan Tan, Fan Tan

How could love have been so wrong
When she hadn't known me long
Fan Tan never brought her down
But it's all she ever wanted around
And now I only think of her

Fan Tan in my I hand
You understand I do prefer
Once you try it you will find
The original perfume flavor

Fan Tan, Fan Tan, Fan Tan, Fan Tan
Fan Tan, Fan Tan
Fan Tan, Fan Tan, Fan Tan
