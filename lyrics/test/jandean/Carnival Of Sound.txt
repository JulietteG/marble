Life can have a higher meaning
In a Carnival of Sound
Release the thoughts inside your mind
Seek the truth, it's there to find

Search yourself, analyze
Thoughts just can't be compromised
Deepest meanings can be found
In a Carnival of Sound

Release yourself from thoughts of anger
In the Carnival of Sound
Peace of mind's not hard to find
If you'll only look around

You can see far above
If you look through eyes of love
Eternal wisdom's destined goal
Can be found inside your soul

Life can have a higher meaning
In a Carnival of Sound
Release the thoughts inside your mind
Seek the truth, it's there to find

Search yourself, analyze
Thoughts just can't be compromised
Deepest meanings can be found
In a Carnival of Sound

La-La La La La La La
Release yourself from thoughts of anger
In the Carnival of Sound

In the Carnival of Sound
In the Carnival of Sound

You can see far above
If you just look through eyes of love

Carnival of Sound
The Carnival of Sound---Lyrics submitted by Tim Kann.
