Can't compete with the campus kings
Ain't got my letter or a senior ring
Cheerleader with a football dude
When summer comes gonna hustle you

Friday night and I'm with the guys
Not with the girl that I idolize
Little girl if you only knew
When summer comes gonna hustle you

I see her shuffle from class to class
and watch her eyes when the big boys pass
Little girl if you only knew
When summer gonna hustle you ---
