We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
               We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones 
               We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
               We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones

          We all complain about the world and we it's headed. 
                   But where it's headed is up to you and me. 
    We could change the course of our own history with a million voices  
                                        [Inaudible] 
         We've had enough of the way you have born in to humanity 
              We are the young and we are changing every thing

             We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
             We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
             We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
             We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones

     They seem so high up on the pedestals our fathers build them. 
                        trust in them to save their sons 
              But the tyrants and the greedy will fall in time

        We've had enough of the way you have born in to humanity 
             We are the young and we are changing every thing

            We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
            We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
            We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
            We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones

       We've had enough of the way you have born in to humanity 
            We are the young and we are changing every thing

            We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
            We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
            We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones
            We are the chosen. We are the chosen ones---Lyrics submitted by Martin Martinez.
