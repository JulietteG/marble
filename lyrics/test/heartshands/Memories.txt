Speak nothing but a lie
Speak nothing but a lie to me
In a world where we are what we choose to see
I think I found the key

You lied
Don't try and tell me
That I'm the only one who sees
You were never there for me
You were never there
Don't try and tell me
That I'm the only one who sees
Don't try and tell me
You were ever there for me

I'm not the one who walked away
But I wasn't the reason that you didn't stay
You've got a thing or two,
You need to figure out, figure out about you
And you were the reason that I couldn't sleep
You're never coming back
And maybe we're all just better off this way

But you don't own my dreams
My thoughts were made for only me
Don't try and blame me for this
You couldn't understand
Our past is forever broken
My heart lies in my hands

I'm not the one who walked away
But I wasn't the reason that you didn't stay
You've got a thing or two,
You need to figure out, figure out about you
And you were the reason that I couldn't sleep
You're never coming back
And maybe we're all just better off this way

I am not broken, I won't be afraid
I'm burning every memory we made
I am not broken, I won't be afraid
I'm burning every memory we made
I am not broken, I won't be afraid
I'm burning every memory we made
I am not broken, I won't be afraid
I'm burning every memory we made---Lyrics submitted by Koree Wilburn.
