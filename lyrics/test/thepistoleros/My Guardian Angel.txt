And as I hurdle through the cold Nebraskan night
I hear your voice and know that I might e alright
And tough I once was rich, 
I know what it is to be hungry
And though I've nearly drowned
I know what it is to be thirsty.

Angel de mi guarda
De me dulce compania
No me disampares
Ni de noche, ni de dia

And as the dawn comes
and a brand new day begins
And day seems darker than the night have ever been
And though I once was rich
I know what it is to be hungry 
And though I nearly drowned
I know what it is to be thirsty

Angle de mi guarda....---Lyrics submitted by Jen Brown.
