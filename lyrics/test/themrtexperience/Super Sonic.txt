An ugly sound it's all around sound is pain won't go away a lot of noise a sonic scare makes you feel like you're somewhere we know we're nowhere we like to think we're somewhere supersonic idiotic brain-infected disconnected you're high got the evil eye and you're not preaching what I believe in you're always talking I'd rather be deaf and dumb I can't stop that ring I can't hear a thing I can't hear myself think supersonic casualty you think you're cool you make the rules cause you got action and you're in fashion you got ideas you got a theory but I don't hear it I've lost my hearing you're so pretentious I'd rather be daf and dumb it's more fun it won't start an earthquake maybe just give you a headache but we're pretty good at that ultra sonic sound attack.---Lyrics submitted by domingo.
