Send the caller
Gather round
Light the torches
Burn this ground

They've been
Waiting
For to long
Little kids
C'mon

Little doctor
Little say
Help me get this
On [fight?] day

They've been
Waiting
For to long
Little kids
C'mon

We won't say it now
We won't go (oh!)

Won't say it now
We gotta go yeah

You fix your (?)

Hey! Hey! Hey!
[We had a secret
But it (?)?]
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Revolution for a 
Salad vendor
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Get your [courage?]
Cause its fucked
Get your (?)
You'll get stuck

You can kick that
From the rail
Little kids
C'mon

Little doctor
Little say
Help me get this
On fight day

They've been
Waiting
For to long
Little kids
C'mon

We won't say it now
We won't go (oh!)

Won't say it now
We gotta go yeah

You fix your (?)

Hey! Hey! Hey!
