Here I am again
Singing the same old tune
Holding everything as close as I can to you
If love is anywhere
Mine still belongs with you
But Im holding it in my hand

She lays her head
Upon your shoulder
But all I see is the way that you hold her
You live in your house
With a beautiful view
And I live in an your apple tree

I am a songbird
Singing out your window
Telling stories in the shade 
And I cant fly away
I cant fly away

Imagine me
Flying around the world
Or Italy on a terraced hill
No matter where lifes taking me
I may still be up in your apple tree

I am a songbird
Singing out your window
Telling stories in the shade 
And I cant fly away
I cant fly away
No I cant fly away
I cant fly away
Ill follow wherever you go
Cause I cant fly away---Lyrics submitted by Vincent A.
