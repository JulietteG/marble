I wasnt born so long ago
But theres a lot I know I dont know
I never told a single lie 
I cross my fingers till I die
Oh

I have a secret little lie/life
That I come home from every night
I wash the makeup off my face
Then lie in bed where I feel safe

Ill tell ya somethin you dont know
Ill tell ya somethin thatll make you whole
Well Im tired

I caught a glimpse of you tonight
Yes I could see you through the light
You smiled behind those big blue eyes
You smiled away my lonely night 

So tell me something I dont know
Tell me something thatll make me hold on
Im tired
(Gotta get a hold, Im tired)

It seems my days are all the same
Cause Im twisting all that I can take/tame
But I dont think you play that game
I bet you dance out in the rain
So tell me something I dont know
Tell me something thatll make me hold on tight
Hold on tight---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Yeager.
