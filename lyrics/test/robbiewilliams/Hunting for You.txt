I walk around these empty streets
They say theres nothing left for me
I say theres no one here for you

Down in the land, the land of the blind
The one eyed king, he stole my mind
And I let him

Everything I likes illegal, seductive
Addictive in my world, corrosive, destructive
But Ive got kind words in my heart.
Its a passion
Your fashions, in fashion

Tonight Im hunting for you
Tonight Im hunting for you
Tonight Im hunting for

The stone is set, the dye is cast
I am the wreckage of my past
And I am not afraid to ask

I sail away my sanity just to find some company
Now darling

Everything I likes illegal, seductive
Addictive, immoral, corrosive, destructive
Your addiction to danger makes me no stranger
Its fashion, only fashion

Tonight Im hunting for you
Tonight Im hunting for you
Tonight Im hunting for you
Tonight Im hunting for

Ill be gone but I wont be cheap
There is no limit here for me
And Ill take everything I need
Ill need everything, everything

You can waste away in fashion
When you chase the daylight home
You can waste away in fashion
When you chase the daylight home

Tonight Im hunting for you
Tonight Im hunting for you
Tonight Im hunting for you
Tonight Im hunting for you
Tonight Im hunting for

You can waste away in fashion
(Tonight Im hunting for you)
Tonight Im hunting for you
When you chase the daylight home
(Tonight Im hunting for you)
Tonight Im hunting for you ---Lyrics submitted by Brunklaus.
