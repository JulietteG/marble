When karma reaches you I wanna be there just in case it needs help,
You made me be so cruel to myself,
The love of power or the power of love,
You need help.

When karma reaches you I wanna be there to catch that fall,
Get down beside you and watch you crawl,
How does it feel to be alone?
Down there.

When you wont fall apart again,
It won't break my heart.

If I told you my secrets,
Youd never look at me the same way,
Well I guess youre right, some things I cant change,
When karma reaches you I wanna be there just in case it needs help.

I wont fall apart again,
I don't test my heart

Is there any wonder,
With the sadness inside her?
Was it sent for the hunger?
Was it meant to divide her?

Into the silence.
Into the silence.
Into the silence.
Into the silence.

When karma reaches you I wanna be there to catch that fall,
Get down beside you and watch you crawl,
How does it feel to be alone?
Down there.

Don't fall apart again,
Don't test my heart.

Is there any wonder?
With the sadness inside her?
Was it sent for the hunger?
Was it meant to divide her?

Into the silence.
Into the silence.
Into the silence.
Into the silence.---Lyrics submitted by Kit Baker.
