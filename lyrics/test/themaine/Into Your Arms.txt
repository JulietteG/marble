There was a new girl in town
She had it all figured out
And i'll state something rash
She had the most amazing smile
i bet you didn't expect that
but she made me change my ways
with eyes like sunsets baby
And legs that went on for days

I'm falling in love 
But it's falling apart
I need to find my way back to the start
When we were in love
Things were better than they are
Let me back into
Into your arms

She made her way to the bar
I tried to talk to her 
but she seemed so far
Outta my league
I had to find a way 
To get her next to me

I'm falling in love
But it's falling apart
I need to find my way back to the start
When we were in love
Things were better than they are
Let me back into
Into your arms

Oh she's slippin away
I always freeze when i'm thinking of words to say
All the things she does
Make it seem like love
If it's just a game
Then i like the way that we play---Lyrics submitted by kaesie.
