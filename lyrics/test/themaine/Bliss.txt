This where we belong
This is where we long to be
Repose in hell
Just breathe

And I say
What doesn't kill you
Will keep you sane
Just go lift the veil
From your left brain

Is this not what you're here for?
Is this not why you came?
Buy a ticket to a place
That no one can explain
Just take the right
Allow yourself to give in to this bliss

A day late
Another dollar short
I had to burn the bills
To keep warm
I fear the disease they carry
But those paper cups
Don't scare me now
That I could see

Is this not what you're here for?
Is this not why you came?
Buy a ticket to a place
That no one can explain
Just take the right
Allow yourself to give in to this bliss

Is this not what you're here for?
Is this not why you came?
Buy a ticket to a place
That no one can explain

Is this not what you're here for?
Is this not why you stayed?
Find your way to feeling nothing
Can't replace
Well, Just take the right
Allow yourself to give in to this---
