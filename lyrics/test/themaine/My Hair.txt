My hair is tired and it's falling out
But before it all does I think I will let it down
I'll grow it out like it's the 60s, man
Because I feel young enough and just because I can

Grow your hair out, let your hair down while you still can
Because it'll fall out, you'll go bald like an old man
Put the top down, let your locks blow around
Driving through town without a care
Grow it to the ground, let it all down everywhere
Grow out your hair

The other morning as I rolled on out
Of my bed I got tripped up by something on the ground
My curls had down all the way to the floor
I kinda like the way it looks
I'll grow it out some more

Grow your hair out, let your hair down while you still can
Because it'll fall out, you'll go bald like an old man
Put the top down, let your locks blow around
Driving through town without a care
Grow it to the ground, let it all down everywhere

Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
Not my momma or a big wig millionaire
I'll let it all down anywhere
I'll let it all down everywhere
See I don't care if you all care
It's on my head and it's not your hair

Grow your hair out, let your hair down while you still can
Because it'll fall out, you'll go bald like an old man
Put the top down, let your locks blow around
Driving through town without a care
Grow it to the ground, let it all down everywhere
Grow out your hair

Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair

(Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair)

Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair

(Gotta cut loose!)

Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair

(Let it all down)

Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair

(Grow out your hair!)---
