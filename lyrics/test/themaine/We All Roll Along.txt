I remember every night we spent on weekends
with good friends
we did nothing 
but it seems like we did so much
back then

back then we were kicking and laughing 
all relaxing and taking things for granted
we did anything but just that little rush
oh yeah

just don't forget this 
we wont regret this 
we've got one chance 
to get it right

we're alive and we're 
tied to the center of it
where we know we're all fine
and this just can't be it
and in the end we all know 
we only breathe for so long

so tonight's the night
we all roll along

oh back to the first cigarette
and we cant forget 
all of the faces that we met
81, 23
means everything to me

take me back to the parking lots 
the sleeps we fought 
and all the places we got caught
this place will always be apart of me 
yeah you're all apart of me

just don't forget this
we wont regret this 
we've got one chance 
to get it right

we're alive and we're tied 
to the center of it
where we know we're all fine
and this just cant be it
and in the end we all know 
we only breathe for so long

so tonight's the night 
we all roll along

i remember everyday 
that i spent dreaming 
oh breathing
this place behind that i will 
run away from thinking

adding up all the days been wasted
chasing the girls we hated
somethings they, they never change

Take me back to the sleepless nights
stupid fights you know it never
mattered who was wrong 
or who was right and now you're 
all apart of me 

we're alive and we're tied 
to the center of it
where we know we're all fine
and this just cant be it
and in the end we all know 
we only breathe for so long

so tonight's the night
we all roll along---Lyrics submitted by Connor.
