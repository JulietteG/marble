24 floor
Up in some hotel room
Feeling solo
Thinking of jumping soon
I look up and see the stars
Look down at speeding cars
Think of my family
How they'll remember me
Eyes closed, I see your face
Breathe deep and hesitate
I hear the words you'd say
If you were here with me
You'd say,

"You don't wanna die tonight
Take one more breath to clear your mind
Every moment's relevant
Bittersweet and delicate
Tomorrow may not come again"

24 floors
Up in some hotel room
Feeling so low
And some kind of muted blue
The TV talks at me
Apocalyptically
Fosters the fear in me
But somehow I hear your plea
With eyes closed, I see your face
I breathe deep and hesitate
I hear the words you'd say
Feels like you're here with me
And you say,

"You don't wanna die tonight
Take one more breath to clear your mind
Every moment's relevant
Bittersweet and delicate
Tomorrow may not come again
Tonight is all there is"

Oh, if this is all there is
Yeah, if this is all there is

You don't wanna die tonight
Take one more breath to clear your mind
This moment is relevant
Bittersweet and delicate
Tomorrow may not come again
Tonight is all there is

If this is all there is

24 floors
Up in some hotel room---
