Well the sun came up 
A little too fast this morning
Just light that burned in my eyes
No there was no warnin'
No sweet birds sing
No church bells ring
Yes it took everyone by surprise
Too little time to say these last goodbyes

So if you must go
Baby please go slow
Just take your time
You don't have to hurry so
And I'll close my eyes
Cause I don't want to see you wave goodbye
Just leave me something
Something to remember you by

There's a picture I carry
Around in the back of my mind
It's of you and me 
But those were much happier times
Though a picture may be 
Worth a thousand words
Even Vincent Van Gogh
Would paint you back into my world

So if you must go
Baby please go slow
Just take your time
You don't have to hurry so
And I'll close my eyes
'Cause I don't wanna see you wave goodbye
Just leave me something
Something to remember you by

I know he's waiting
I'm gonna be waiting too
But what's a few minutes to him
Compared to a lifetime without you

So if you must go
Baby please go slow
Just take your time
You don't have to hurry so
Please close your eyes
If you don't wanna see me cry
Just leave me something 
Something to remember you by
Just leave me something
Something to remember you by---Lyrics submitted by Tanya McLauchla.
