Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Not be all else to me save that Thou art
Thou my best thought by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light

Be Thou my wisdom and Thou my true worth
I ever with thee and Thou with me Lord
Thou my Great Father, I thy true son
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one

Riches i heed not, nor man's empty gain
Thou mine inheritance, now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven, My treasure Thou art

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven Son
Heart of my own heart, whatever may fall
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all---Lyrics submitted by Penney.
