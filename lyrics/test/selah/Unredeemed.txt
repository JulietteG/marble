The cruelest word
The coldest heart
The deepest wound
The endless dark
The lonely ache
The burning tears
The bitter nights
The wasted years
Life breaks and falls apart
But we know these are

Places
Where grace is
Soon to be so amazing
They may be unfulfilled
They may be unrestored
But when anything thats shattered
Is laid before the Lord
Just watch and see
It will not be
Unredeemed

For every choice
That led to shame
And all the love
That never came
For every vow
That someone broke
And every life
That gave up hope
We live in the shadow of the fall
But the cross says these are all  just

Places
Where grace is
Soon to be so amazing
They may be unfulfilled
They may be unrestored
But when anything thats shattered
Is laid before the Lord
Just watch and see
It will not be
Unredeemed

Places
Where grace is
Soon to be so amazing
They may be unfulfilled
They may be unrestored
You never know the miracle
The Father has in store
Just watch and see
It will not be
Unredeemed---Lyrics submitted by josh.
