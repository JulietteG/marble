Before the throne of God above,
I have a strong and perfect plea.
Agreat high Preist whose name is Love
Who ever lives and pleads for me.

CHORUS 1
My name is graven on his hands.
My name is written on his heart.
I know that while in Heaven He stands.
No tongue can bid me thence depart.
No tongue can bid me thence depart.


When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made and end to all my sin.

CHORUS 2
Because the sinless Savior died, 
My sinful soul is counted free.
For God, the just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me.
To look on Him and pardon me.

Behold Him ther, the risen Lamb.
My perfect, spotless rightousness.
The great unchangeable I Am.
The King of glory and of grace.

CHORUS 3
One with Himself, I cannot die.
My soul is purchased by his blood.
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ, my Savior and my God.
With Christ, my Savior and my God.

CHORUS 3---Lyrics submitted by Michele.
