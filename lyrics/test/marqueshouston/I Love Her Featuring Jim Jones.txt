I love her
But I love you

  ( i know how you feel, crucial decisions to make)

Part 1

Don't know if i want Keisha, Felisha or anyone
There's something about each one of them, 
which make all of them special
Been all around the world
with so many girls
with different qualities
everyone seem to have something i want

Chorus

ooh i need that one 
couple days later 
I promise she's the one
things come true 
tell whats this grown man to do
i gotta have her, but i want you too 

I love her 
I love you 
but i love her and her too
they all could be the one
so find me only one one one one
(2x)

Part 2

I love her, but baby i love you 
going out my money they aint nothing really i can do 
get me did 
if only she can dress like you
if you can walk the way she does ohohh

(chorus)
ooohh i need that one
couple days later 
i promise she's that one 
things come true 
tell whats this grown man to do 
i gotta have her, but i want you too

Jim Jones

i i i  gotta have her but i want her too 
i gotta have her but i want her too
so now i need help with my obsession
im workin on my addiction
im stoppin for all the pretty girls in the cars i be whippin
and my positions 
i ballen like the pistons
im on fire i stop, drop and  i roll
i watch em get it 
they see im on it like the vampires been in my scoop
i hit em, i dip em, turn em into honey dippers
the money getters is what the ladies be callin us
actin like they ignoring us
and really they be on all of us
and all of us 
we can take a flight 
you you you and her 
we can make it bright

Chorus 
I love her
i love you  
but i love her and her too
they all could be the one 
but theres only one one one---Lyrics submitted by Cassie.
