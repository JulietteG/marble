Girl, you are the definition of a real woman
I can be all the man you need
Oh but there's just one thing
That I'm really tryin' to cope with
And girl, I want you to know that's all you need to know
Every time I'm with you I freeze up
Look what you do to me
Your beauty's got me all bottled up
I'm going crazy

Cause girl you got me
Speechless, speechless
(Speechless) speechless (speechless) speechless
(Speechless, speechless) speechless babe

So baby, I need your patience
Cause I need time to think
About what I'm gonna say to you
Because the next time that we meet
I wanna be so prepared
Cause girl I got a problem and I just gotta get over it
Cause whenever I'm with you I freeze up
Look what you do to me
Your beauty's got me all bottled up

Cause girl you got me
Speechless, speechless
(Speechless, speechless)
Oh you got me speechless
(Speechless) speechless (speechless)

Oh baby I'ma do my best
To get close to you
You're the perfect one for me yeah
The one I'm not gon' lose

Every time I'm with you I freeze, I freeze up girl
Cause beauty's got me all bottled up

Got me speechless (speechless, speechless)
Got me speechless (speechless, speechless)

Speechless, speechless
Speechless---
