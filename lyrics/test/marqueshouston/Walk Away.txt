Verse 1

i can truly say it's not everyday someone makes me feel this way
just like a star shooting past the moon
feels like a holiday
I wanna take you away to another place
where the love just overflows babe
you were like my rain 
that needed to fall
when the flowers would not grow

Chorus

has anybody ever told you
that your eyes shine like pearls
has anybody ever told you
that your one special girl
has anybody ever showed you
that love is here to stay
cause you stole my heart 
on this very day
and i cant let you walk away

Verse 2

you took me by surprise
and open my eyes
like a child with brand new toys
I never had so much inspiration
now my soul is filled with joy
i can feel my soul and feel my heart
even for the very first time
i knoe im not your man but im making plans
like your already mine

Chorus

has anybody ever told you
that---Lyrics submitted by Sharelle.
