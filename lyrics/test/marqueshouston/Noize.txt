Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This is mattress music
Hey, yeah

Oh, la, la, la, na, na, na
Now I'mma give it to you, baby, just the way you like it, aye
And I can tell by the way you holdin' on the bed that you like it
And you tryin' hard not to scream but your pillow biting
Girl, please don't fight it
(Yeah)

La, la, la, na, na, na
'Cause every time you push and pull it just goes deeper
(Deeper)
So open up nice and wide, baby, I'm gone feed ya
(Feed ya)
And we 'bout to make a movie, a double feature
(Ooh)
Scream if you need to

Tell the mattress to be quiet, I can't hear you
And I love it when you make that noize, noize, noize
Screamin' 'til you lose your voice, voice, voice
This so good you ain't got no choice
Baby, wanna make you moist, that's when you make that noize

So go a little loud for me
Ay, aye, ay, baby, baby
Go a little loud for me
Aye, aye, aye
(Ooh, ooh)
Baby, baby

Go and get loud for me
Aye, aye, aye
(Ooh, ooh)
Baby, baby

Go and get loud for me
Aye, aye, aye
(Ooh, ooh)
Yea
Said, I love it when you make that noize---Lyrics submitted by keisha.
