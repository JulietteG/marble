When we were together 
Those were the happiest time in all my life 
Now we`re separated I don`t know what I will do 

`Cause I can`t love another 
No matter how I try 
`Cause I know. It`s impossible 

Where ever you may be 
I hope you`ll hear my song 
Then maybe you`ll realise, my love
 that you were wrong 

`Cause I can`t love another 
No matter how hard I try 
`Cause I know. It`s impossible 

The sunset outside my window 
Has lost all it`s glow 
The rose in the garden, my love 
Doesn`t bloom any more 

Where ever you may be 
I hope you`ll hear my song 
Then maybe you`ll realise, my love
 that you were wrong 

`Cause I can`t ever love another 
No matter how hard I try 
`Cause I know. It`s impossible---Lyrics submitted by johnny vega.
