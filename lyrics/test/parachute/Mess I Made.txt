Should have kissed you there
I should have held your face, 
I should have watched those eyes
Instead of run in place, I should have called you out
I should have said your name, I should have turned around
I should have looked again 

[Chorus]
but ohh, I'm staring at the mess I made
I'm staring at the mess I made, I'm staring at the mess I made, as you
turn, you take your heart and walk away

Should have held my ground, I could have been redeemed
for every second chance that changed it's mind on me
I should have spoken up, I should have proudly claimed
that all my heads to blame for all my hearts mistakes

[Chorus]

And it's you, and it's you, and it's you
and it's you, and it's pulling me down 
as you walk away and it's for me now
as you goooo 

[Chorus]

and it's falling down as you walk away 
and it's for me now as you goooooooooo
but ohhhhh

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Jodie.
