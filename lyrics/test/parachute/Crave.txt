Who gave you moves, girl? 
Moves girl 
Moves girl 
I'm bound to lose you 
Sooner or later 
I watch your eyes 
Catch the light 
As we move, girl 
Your skin on my skin 
I feel it 

Oh, it made me want to spend some time 
Oh, it made me want to spend some time 
Oh, it made me want to spend some time

Oh Lord, gonna find somebody 
Find somebody 
Find somebody to love 
I try but I'm always running 
Can't stop running 
End up being alone 
But Lord, when I saw you coming 
Ooh, someone had finally done it 
You made me want to spend some time 
(Spend some time, spend some time) 

I crave your lovin' on
