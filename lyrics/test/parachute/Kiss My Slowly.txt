Stay with me
Baby stay with me, tonight
Don't leave me alone
Walk with me
Come and walk with me
To the edge of all we've ever known

I can see you there with the city lights
Fourteenth floor, pale blue eyes
I can breath you in
Two shadows standing by the bedroom door
No I could not want you more than I did right then
As our heads leaned in

Well I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed, all I see is the skyline through the window
The moon above you and the streets below
Hold my breath as your moving in. Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby don't run
Just kiss me slowly

Stay with me
Baby stay with me, tonight
Don't leave me alone
She shows me everything she used to know
Picture frames and country roads
Where the days were long and the world was small

Oh she stood by as it fell apart
Separate rooms and broken hearts
But I won't be the one to let you go

Im not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed, all I see is the skyline through the window
The moon above you and the streets below
Hold my breath as your moving in.
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby dont run
Just kiss me slowly

Don't run away
And it's hard to love again
When the only way its been
When the only love you know, just walked away
If it's something that you want, darling you don't have to run
You dont have to go

Just stay with me
Baby stay with me

Well I'm not sure what this is gonna be
But with my eyes closed, all I see is the skyline through the window
The moon above you and the streets below
Hold my breath as your moving in.
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby don't run
Just kiss me slowly

I'm not sure where this is gonna go
But in this moment, all I know is the skyline through the window
The moon above you and the streets below
Hold my breath as your moving in.
Taste your lips and feel your skin
When the time comes, baby don't run
Just kiss me slowly---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
