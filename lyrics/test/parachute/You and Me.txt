Hold my gun and watch the door
Pick the lock and cut the phone
Keep your head up, love,
Nobody here can stop us

Grab the bags when sirens call
We're out the window, through the yard
Keep it locked up tight
Nobody here can stop us

Baby, I've had this same dream
Where I wake up wondering
What it really means
If the world came running down

If it was you and me against the world
Baby, they've got us under but
We'll take whatever we want.
If it was you and me against the world,
You get the car, I'll get the cash,
We'll take the money and run.

They'll come running through the door
Shattered glass across the floor
Oh, they think they know but
We both know they don't.
Oh, we did our crime and got away,
We stole the gold and made the day
And we both smiling know they saying
Ain't nobody here can stop us.

Baby, I've had this same dream
Where I wake up wondering
What it really means
If the world came running down

If it was you and me against the world
Baby, they've got us under but
We'll take whatever we want.
If it was you and me against the world,
You get the car, I'll get the cash,
We'll take the money and run.

Oh, I keep waking up
In an empty bed
And it's reminding me of
All the things I should have said
And, oh, we could have had

If it was you and me against the world,
Baby, they've got us under but
We'll take whatever we want.
If it was you and me against the world,
You get the car, I'll get the cash,
We'll take the money and run.

If it was you and me against the world,
Baby, they've got our number but
We'll take whatever we want.
If it was you and me against the world,
You get the car, I'll get the cash,
We'll take the money and run.

You get the car, I'll get the cash,
We'll take the money and run.

It's you and me against the world.---Lyrics submitted by Rebekah Russ.
