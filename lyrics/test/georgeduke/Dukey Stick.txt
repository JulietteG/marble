Uhh, now that the bridge, is on this side of the border
Why dont ya'll come over here with us
You wanna walk the water?
And if you ever should see a skunk shake his rump
Tell him to come on over here for some (big funk in the dump)

Now, we got this stick, that will set you free
All you got to do is uhh, take a closer walk with me
Now we got this thang, that's full of magic tricks
So come feel if you will, the magic of the dukey stick

We want to play for you
We want to sing to you 
We want your hips to move 
We want your lips to groove (I feel a thrill)

Funky in the dunky

Uh ive got this magic wand that is guaranteed
To make you come, to me baby
To set yourself free (with the dukey stick)
Mmm, my magic wand can do almost anything, 
Spitting fire or making rings.
But most of all it will make you spread your wings 
And fly away (talk to me quick)

Let me know (let me know)
We want your mind to blow (my mind to blow, is that all?)
Let me know (Oohh)
We want your mind to blow (we want your mind to blow)

(Give it to me baby)

(Give it to me boo boo)

Let me know (oh, fly away baby, let me know)
We want your mind to blow (you got to blow)
Let me know (yeah)
We want your mind to blow

We want to play for you 
We want to sing to you
We want your hips to move 
We want your lips to groove

We want to play for you (oh yeah)
We want to sing to you
We want your hips to move
We want your lips to groove (uhh)

Uhh, if you think this sticks a trick
Then uhh, just step up to the funky chick mama
And get your wick uhh .. flipped a bit
Aend the jury, (with the dukey stick)
Cause the dukey stick 
Is aware of each and everyone one of yall
And beckons you to come on through
With the skunk with funks of a mare

Let me know (ohhh)
We want your mind to blow(you got to blow)
Let me know (let me know baby ohh)
We want your mind to blow (ooo)

We want to play for you (ooh father)
We want to sing to you (with the dukey stick)

We want your hips to move (move it to me baby )
We want your lips to groove (on me b)

We want to play for you (on me d, you need a dukey stick)
We want to sing to you (on me b , you need a dukey stick)
We want your hips to move (don't need to like your coltrane, you need a dukey stick)
We want your lips to groove (on the water, everyone)

We want to play for you (hey, you need a dukey stick )
We want to sing to you (yeah, you need a dukey stick )
We want your hips to move (ohh, you need a dukey stick )
We want your lips to groove (you need a dukey stick )

Now that you've seen the magic 
That this magic wand possesses
Let us all confess 
That we have seen what we do not believe in (dunky funk)
What you gonna do now angie v, (tell me about e, e? who's e, sheila)

At the bridge (she got dropped off )

Let me know (ohh)
We want your mind to blow (blow your mind)
Let me know (leave your troubles behind )
We want your mind to blow (yeah)

We want to play for you (ohh yeah, with the dukey stick )
we want to sing to you (oh)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
