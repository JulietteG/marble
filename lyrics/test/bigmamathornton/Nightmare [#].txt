Nightmare
Last night I had a nightmare
Nightmare
Last night I had a nightmare
I woke up screaming
Cause I was dreaming
That my man was gone
Cry
I just cant stop my cry
Cry
I just cant stop my cry
I feel so blue
My dream came true
Lone, my man is gone
Lone, is gone
Darkness
My whole life is fill with darkness
Darkness
My whole life is fill with darkness
All I do is cry
I wanna die
Woh! Since my man is gone
Lone, gone---Lyrics submitted by Dolores.
