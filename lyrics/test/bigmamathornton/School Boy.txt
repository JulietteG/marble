I'm a little school girl
Yeeeah
I'm a little school girl
And I want those boys
I want those boys
Take me out, yeah
And I want my little school boy 
Show me what it's all about
I told my mama
Told my mama
That he was a school boy
He was my friend
Yeah-hey
And told my mom and my brother that he was no kin
Talkin bout my school boy 
And I'm a little school girl
I want him to teach me the golden rule
Hey hey
That's my school boy
Hey hey I'm a school girl too (talkin bought my school boy)

Hey school boy!
Want everybody
Clap your hands 
We gettin married
Don't you understand?
No more school girl
No more play
All I do is hang around the house all day
Now I'm a school girl
He's my school boy
Talkin bout my baby
Fly on over
Gonna fly on over (x3)
Ooh yeah

Now listen
Gonna buy me an airplane (x2)
Fly all over 
Fly all over this town
Well I see my little old school boy
Gonna set this airplane down
Fly
Flyin
I'm flyin
I'm havin a good time
Bring me a ham hock
Collared greens
Black eyed peas
Hey hey
A little corn bread
A little crackling bread
Sauerkraut
A little will do
A hamburger
Ooooh
Fish and chips
Sardines
Hamburgers
How bout a little salami
How bout a cracker
A piece of bread
Cup of coffee
Oooh
Talkin bout my school days (x3)
I had a wonderful time
Ohhh-ohhh---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
