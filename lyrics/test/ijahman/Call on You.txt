When I need my love,
I call on you,
Cause you make me feel,
on top of the world.

Girl you make my heart,
beat so fast,
I know the reason,
our love is going to last.

Your loving ways,
and true devotion,
has got me,

There's gentleness,
in your every touch,
oh baby,

We pledge our love,
will always be,
true to each other,
until eternity.

I have you in my arms,
next to my heart,
I have the feeling,
our love is going to last.

Your loving ways,
and true devotion,
has got me,

There's gentleness,
in your every touch,
oh baby,

When I need my love,
I call on you,
cause you make me feel,
on top of the world.

we pledge our love,
will always be,
true to each other,
until eternity.

I have you in my arms,
next to my heart,
I have the feeling,
our love is going to last.

Your loving ways,
and true devotion,
has got me,

There's gentleness,
in your every touch,
oh baby,

When I need my love,
I call on you,
Cause you make me feel,
on top of the world.

Girl you make my heart,
beat so fast,
I know the reason,
our love is going to last.---Lyrics submitted by Craig.
