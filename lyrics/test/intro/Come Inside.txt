[Chorus}

If you let me
Let me come inside
I'll keep you
I'll keep you satisfied tonight (baby tonight)
If you want me, if you need me
If you let me
turn down all the lights
I'll make you
I'll make you feel alright tonight (come on)
Come inside, Come inside

[Verse 1]

I'm thinkin about cha', the last time we made love
and i fantasize. So many things that i dream of
i wanna do with you baby, and tonight won't be the same
i wanna come inside, i like to hear you call my name

Slowly i'll give it to you baby, only if you promise me you'll let your mind run free
grab a hold and love me totally.
i wanna slip and slide (oooo) dip and dive (ooo wee) do anything to make it alright tonight
I wanna make love to you (oh baby)

[Chorus again]


[Verse 2]

Baby just imagine, i can do anything you please
I'll set your body on fire, or sooth your soul with ease
Just a kiss, i'll taste your sweet sweet lips
All of the passion i have inside of me, i know you won't forget oh baby

Slowly i'll give it to you darlin, only if you promise me you'll let your mind run free
grab a hold and love me totally.
i wanna slip and slide (come on, aaaaa) dip and dive (wooooo) do anything to make it alright tonight
I wanna make love to you (oh baby)

[Repeat chorus]

Let me rub you down
let me caress you all over your body baby
move in closer now
feel my nature rise
Hold on tight and don't (no don't) let go..oh
I'm comin i'm comin oh hold on---Lyrics submitted by David.
