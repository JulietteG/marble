Oh so long for this night i prayed
That a star would guide you my way.
To share with.....me this special day.

            Where a ribbons in the sky for our love...

If allowed.......may i touch your hand?
and if pleased....may i once again?....
So that you too will understand......
Theres a ribbon in the sky for our love.

(Dooting)

This is not a coincidence....
And far more than a lucky chance....
But what it is.....That was always meant....
is a ribbon in the sky for our love!

We cant lose.....with god on our side....
we'll find strength in each tear we cry.....
from now on.....it will be you and I.....

and a ribbon in the sky.....
a ribbon in the sky......
a ribbon in the skyyyyyyyyy....
for our looooooooooooooooooove!

Dont you know theres a ribbon.......
in the skyyyyyyyyy!

listen........for so long this night i prayed.....that a star
will guide you my way!

its no coincidence
or a lucky chance!

But what it is......what it is.....was always meant......a ribbon in the skyyy!---Lyrics submitted by Nuni.
