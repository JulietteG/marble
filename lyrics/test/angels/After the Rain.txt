Who lies on sheets of ice?
Who pays for paradise?
After the rain    After the rain

Who suffers, fools and freaks?
Who hang in the guilty cliques?
After the rain    After the rain

Chorus:        
Somebody save me the waters rising
Sweet Jesus take the blame
Who knows whos star is falling
After the rain    After the rain

Who took the gold from their teeth?
Who take the ancient masterpiece?
After the rain   After the rain

Who throws the winning dice?
You lies beneath the ice?
After the rain   After the rain

Chorus
Solo
Chorus

After the rain
After the rain
After the rain , you had better look out!
After the rain
After the rain Yeah
After the rain---Lyrics submitted by Pat.
