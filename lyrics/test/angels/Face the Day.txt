I don't want to face the day   I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day  The dayToday

Long night leaves me stranded   Black vision danger sign
No love, need protection, Feels like I'm on production line
Daggers at dawn cold hearted day, Why does it have to be morning?
Cover my head  staying in bed, Too late for luckless warnings

C:  I don't want to face the day   The day  Today   (2X)

Outside, screaming city, red lights, and hungry eyes
Sucks like a space invader, the vacuum of it's lies
Stealing my strength, stealing my time, It's raining in a world of traders

C: I don't want to face the day   I don't want to face the day

Bridge:    Let me keep on sleeping, forget that I'm alone
              One day, of faceless living, is 24 hours too long!

I don't want to face the day  uh! I don't want to face the day!
I don't want to face the day      The day.The day
     (Solo)
Bridge 2:  Give me the night, it's more forgiving, hold back the light from my eyes
               Please stay, invisible darkness, can't see the tears I cry
               I know it's coming, loaded with nothing, trapped in a tunnel of time!

I don't want to face the day  I don't want to face the day
I don't want to face the day    the day   today
I don't want to face the day   the day   today
I don't want to face the day (keep repeating to fadeout)---Lyrics submitted by Pat.
