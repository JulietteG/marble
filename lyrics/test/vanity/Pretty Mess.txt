Ahh!...Here we go again falling on my bed and pulling on a pillow 
Well I think you got what it takes to get me boiling like a kettle 
Here everything's boiling up 
I boil to the maximum,yeah 
Well I do believe babe,you boil me bubbling 
You get me in so much trouble 

Ooh and baby someday soon 
I will take you there 
Promise you the moon 
And then he pulled a seam and it went all the way 

(chorus) 
Ooh yeah,such a pretty mess 
He made such a pretty mess on my dress 
Ooh yeah,such a pretty mess 
Such a pretty 

Here we go again,pulling on my hair 
I'm dripping like a hot tea 
I'm aware if you drip it too hot 
It just might spill all over this lovely 
Here everything's boiling up 
I boil to the maximum,yeah 
Well I do believe babe,you boil me bubbling 
You get me in double trouble 

Ooh and baby someday soon 
I will take you there 
Promise you the moon 
And then I took a drink and it went all the way 

(chorus) 
Ooh yeah,such a pretty mess 
We've made such a pretty mess of my dress 
ooh yeah,such a pretty mess 
Oh such a pretty 

Here we go again,crawling through the kitchen...oh ho ho hum 
I bet you got what it takes to get me into a living room position 


Ooh and baby someday soon 
I will take you there 
Promise me the moon 
And then he found a hallway that went all the way 

(chorus) 
Ooh yeah,such a pretty mess 
He made such a pretty mess of my dress 
Ooh yeah,such a pretty mess 
Oh it's such a pretty---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
