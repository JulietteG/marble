One smoking body 
Half a brain
Enought to drive the guys insane
And yeah your boobs are really ace
And so's your face

I'm sorry but I'm not your kind
Cause I don't stab friends from behind 
But when it comes to flashin' ass
Yes you are head of the class

Yet deep inside you feel the sting
Could they be more beneath your skin?
But guys don't want no part of that
They just want you on your back

Little princess got it made 
With your million dollar face
Yes you're hot and daddy's rich
But you're one shallow bimbo bitch

Little princess you damn bomb
Your priorities gone wrong
Everybody joins your dance
Just to get inside your pants

You just care about yourself
And all the rest can go to hell
Once again you cast your spell
You got the look, the hair, the cheeks 
that knock the guys right off their feet

You're like an angel at first glance
Get every guy to join your dance
But when you ask for more, for love
They just fuck off

Yet deep inside you feel the sting
Could they be more beneath your skin?
But guys don't want no part of that
They just want you on your back

Little princess got it made 
With your million dollar face
Yes you're hot and daddy's rich
But you're one shallow bimbo bitch

Little princess you damn bomb
Your priorities gone wrong
Everybody joins your dance
Just to get inside your pants

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest one of all

Little princess got it made 
With your million dollar face
Yes you're hot and daddy's rich
But you're one shallow bimbo bitch

Little princess you damn bomb
Your priorities gone wrong
Everybody joins your dance
Just to get inside your pan-ants

Little princess you damn bomb
Your priorities gone wrong
Everybody joins your dance
Just to get inside your pants---Lyrics submitted by Anne-Sophie.
