This song is for you baby for making a fool of me
Why don't you kiss my behind I really had faith in you
but you betrayed me to bad that love is blind

But now that i got you tied up I'm  quite sure that  
you know this aint gunna fly there is no need to try 
to kiss up on me your stupid lies wont save you this time
I hate you

              Shut up Shut up
Crying wont hep you get your sorry ass out of it
             Shut up Shut up
I don't want a part of your shitty pity me bit
             Shut up Shut up
I'm sick and tired of your wimpy ass bullshit
             Shut up Shut up
     Get the fuck out of my life

You are dismissed boy go find a new toy i don't give a shit
what you do, We are over and done mister hit and run
I aint going to cry over you i dont care no more im pretty much over you
so don't try to butter me up i am sick of your crap and you can stop all the yappin shut up i've had enough
    I hate you

           Shut up Shut up
Crying won't help you get your sorry ass out of it
          Shut up Shut up
I don't wanna part of your shitty pity me bit
         Shut up Shut up
I'm sick and tired of your wimpy ass bullshit
         Shut up Shut up
    Get the fuck out of my life

My soul is on fire
My heart is a ragin
you're history now
My fortunes are changing
I'm not even bothered
If you have another
I'm so over you or am i

      Shut up Shut up
Crying won't help you get your sorry ass out of it
      Shut up Shut up
I don't want a part of your shitty pity me bit
     Shut up Shut up
I'm sick and tired of your wimpy ass bull shit
      Get the fuck out of my life

      Shut up Shut up
Oh crying wont help you 
     Shut up Shut up
I don't give a shit about what you do-o
    Shut up Shut up
I-I'm sick of your bullshit
      FUCK YOU---Lyrics submitted by Anne-Sophie.
