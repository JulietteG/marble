We watched the sun gently fall into the sea
You whispered, "Sweet love lasts an eternity"
Diamonds on the road, miles making miles
And everything we thought we lost is all coming back to us

[Chorus]
Put your arms around the one you love tonight
Let her know that she's the only one
Put your arms around the one you love tonight
Let her know
Never let her go

Smile for me now and mend this heart again
Time after time, you remind me of what's real
We got this world tied up on a string
And everything I'll ever want is right here next to me

[Chorus]
Put your arms around the one you love tonight
Let her know that she's the only one
Put your arms around the one you love tonight
Let her know 

You hurt me
We get up again
We fall
We get up again
It goes wrong
We get up again
You love me right 'til the end

[Chorus]
Put your arms around the one you love tonight
Let her know that she's the only one
Put your arms around the one you love tonight
Let her know 
You'll never let her go

You'll never let her go 
(Put your arms around the one you love tonight)
You'll never let her go, no, no
(Put your arms around the one you love tonight)

Put your arms around the one you love tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Put your arms around the one you love tonight---Lyrics submitted by Jess.
