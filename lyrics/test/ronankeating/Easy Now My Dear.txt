It always hurts the same, 
it never goes away,
I'm in a mess for weeks,
I can not eat or speak

You'll never see me cry,
Cause you're up on the other side
You don't need to know how bad,
it's better off like that

But now that you're here and it's no one but us
Take the air and breath it in
Don't say a word just pretend that the world
Is easy now, my dear

Wish I had a weakning card,
I through it down so hard,
I wouldn't let you go,
But I looked everywhere I don't

I here you on the lane
Telling me all is fine
That's all I have those words
Everyone I had heard

But now that you're here and it's no one but us
Take the air and breath it in
Don't say a word just pretend that the world
Is easy now

How many times had we taking this round
Moving in circles up than we're down
My heart doesn't know why it hurts when you leave,
Though it perfectly speaks when you're near
Easy now

It always hurts the same, 
it never goes away,
I'm in a mess for weeks,
I can not eat or speak

But now that you're here and it's no one but us
Take the air and breath it in
Don't say a word just pretend that the world
Is easy now,
Easy now, 
Easy now,
My dear---Lyrics submitted by Juliane Sofie Norheim.
