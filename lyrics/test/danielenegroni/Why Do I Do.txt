Every time I rise and fall
When I thought I'd seen it all
But my back's still up against the wall
Yeah
At first you was good to go
Then you turned around and said no no
And as I'm walking out the door
She said
You love your life so well
Don't you go kiss and tell
Is it heaven or is it hell
Say it ain't true
I'm just a sucker for you

Why do I do
I get on the same old rhymes
Why do I do
The things that I know ain't right
Why do I do
I trip on the same old lines
Why do I do that to myself
Oh why

Here I go down this road again
Like a fool I keep jumping in
Must be lovin' this punishment
But the day's gonna come around
She'll be calling my name out loud
And the table's gonna turn around
And I'll say
You love your life so well
You'll feel the pain I felt
There ain't a hope in hell
Say it ain't so
But I'm helplessly, hopelessly wrong

Why do I do
I get on the same old rhymes
Why do I do
The things that I know ain't right
Why do I do
I trip on the same old lines
Why do I do that to myself
Oh why

Back to front and front to back
The way she's got my tightly wrapped
Around her finger, around her finger
Side to side and up to down
The way she got me spinning round
Falling down
I need her
I need her
I need her
Ah

(Yeah, who is to blame
Who's to blame now)

I give her all I have
I know it's bad, but ain't no turning back

Why do I do
I get on the same old rhymes
Why do I do
The things that I know ain't right
Why do I do
I trip on the same old lines
Why do I do that to myself
Oh why---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
