Lord if I find favor in your sight
Lord please hear my hearts cry
Im desperately waiting to be where you are
Ill cross the hottest dessert
Ill travel near or far

For your glory
I will do anything
Just to see you
To behold you as my King
(Repeat)

Lord if I find favor in your sight
Lord please hear my hearts cry
Im desperately waiting to be where you are
Ill cross the hottest dessert
Ill travel near or far

For your glory
I will do anything
Just to see you
To behold you as my King
(Repeat 6)

I want to be where you are
I got to be where you are
(Repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Celicia.
