We are here to address matters that certainly need addressing.
We will point out the points that you are sorely missing.
Right here.

It smells like something that certainly isn't spirit
It will contaminate you if you ever, ever go near it.
You're on

We are to address matters that certainly become oppressing
We will highlight the points that you are fucking missing
It smells like something that certainly isn't spirit
It will contaminate you if you ever, ever go near it.
But don't fear it.
You're on

This is just a faze.
I can quit whenever I want.
This is just a faze.
This is just a faze.
We're on.
