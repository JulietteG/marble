This vacation is over
I hate to see it go
I always laugh at the strange times
That's why you have to let me go

My salvation is coming
As soon as we can go
My redemption is pending
Pending on what you know

This vacation is over
I hate to see it go
I always cry at the wrong times
That's why I have to let you know

I've been grazed by bullets
The bullets in my mind
I've been grazed by bullets
The bullets of a different kind---Lyrics submitted by Brian McGraw.
