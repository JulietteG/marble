In the clouds of distant colors,
Rays of light,
They come to life.
Though we know know there is no other.
We are here.
Wrong or right.

Buildings near the highway
Sent in picture frames of sky.
Thought you dare to call me brother
Will you come to and join the fight?

The wind picks up
Everything seems to pull together
Only
To fall apart.

Gathering storm
Gathering together
Gathering storm
Gathering forever.

In the clouds of distant color
Our lives here, may come to life
Though we may come from different lovers
We are here every night

The wind picks up
Everything seems to pull together
Only
To fall apart

Gathering storm
Gathering together
Gathering storm
Gathering forever

There can be no life
There can be new life
There can be no life
There can be new life
There can be no life
There can be new life
There can be no life
Can you feel the light?
Can you feel the light?
Can you feel the light?
Can you feel the light?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?

Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it?---Lyrics submitted by Brian McGraw.
