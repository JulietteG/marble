Ive been waiting for you, just waiting for you
When you gonna turn?

Ive been tracing your spine, mixing your blood with mine
When you gonna turn?

When you gonna turn around and tell me how
all I want wont be
Coming down to where Im found, your silent vows
steal the life from me

Ive sentenced myself to the outskirts
Ive wandered the places wed go
I drank down the streets with a taste of defeat
til the sky turned to coral and gold

Youre further than the ocean goes, my love
Youre further than the ocean goes,
and my loves not enough
to reach you---
