Oh, I'm walkin' down that track
 And I'm never turnin' back
 Next time you'll see me I'll be home
 There's a train a comin' soon
 I'll be there next Sunday noon,
 Cause I'm 900 miles from my home.

Lord I'm hungry and I'm sore
 Like I've never been before
 Never have I been so all alone
 Now I'm on that one way track
 And I'm never turnin' back
 Yes I'm 900 miles from my home

I've been lonely, I've been blue
 Darlin' I've been true to you
 There's an achin' in my heart
 You'll never know
 Make my bed and light the light
 I'll be with you Sunday night
 Cause I'm 900 miles from my home.

Hear that whistle blow.
Can't you hear that whistle blow?

Won't you try to understand?
 I was born a rambling man
 Just like a gypsy I have roamed
 Now those days are all behind
 Got a woman on my mind
 And I'm 900 miles from my home.

Can't you hear that whistle blow?---Lyrics submitted by Dale Cottongim.
