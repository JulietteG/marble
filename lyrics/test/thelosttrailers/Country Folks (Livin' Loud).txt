Hey look at all those cowgirls tearin down the gravel roads on Saturday night,
Singing Summertime at the top of their lungs, sippin Dixie cups of strawberry wine,
All my boys are out, we holler and whistle and honk our horns in time
Were just country folks livin loud
Were country folks livin loud
Were just country folks livin loud...

Chorus
Were crankin Waylon Jennings in our pickup trucks
Clinkin beer bottles till the sun comes up
Mammas in the church choir, oh, what a sound
Were country folks livin loud
Were drivin tractors in the cotton till the cows come home
Boots on the dance floor, around we go
The Star Spangled Banner, we sing it proud
Were country folks livin loud

Interstates jammed with race fans, were heading towards a Talladega infield sign
Our tailgates are droppin and barbecues poppin, everybodys gonna have a good time
There aint nuthin like those engines starting and the crowd at the finish line
Were just country folks livin loud
Were country folks livin loud
Were just country folks livin loud...

Repeat Chorus

Bridge
Its a hoot and a holler on a touchdown pass
A George Strait crowd when he tips his hat
Lord, aint that what its all about

Repeat Chorus
Were country, and were livin loud---Lyrics submitted by alese.
