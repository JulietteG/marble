Verse 1
As I wake up, in the morning
As I look across the sky
This could be a brand new dawning
When I bid this world goodbye

Chorus
Heavenly sunrise, what glorious morning
When our Lord takes us home
What a great celebration
One like weve never known

Verse 2
I have read in the Bible
How the Savior He will appear
He will come in clouds of glory
And that day is very near

Chorus
Heavenly sunrise, what glorious morning
When our Lord takes us home
What a great celebration
One like weve never known

Heavenly sunrise, what glorious morning
When our Lord takes us home
What a great celebration
One like weve never known---Lyrics submitted by Lora.
