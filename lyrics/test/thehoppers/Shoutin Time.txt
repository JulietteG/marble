I will arise and go to Jesus
He will embrace me in his arms,
In the arms of Christ my Savior,
Oh there are ten thousand charms

(Chorus)
Its shoutin' time in heaven
A sinner once lost is found
Its shoutin' time in heaven
Salvation has been brought down,
No wonder the angels rejoice to know
My sins have been covered by the crimson flow
And now Im feeling fine
Im walking on the highway with my Lord
My name is written down in courts above
Its shoutin' time in heaven,
Oh yes, its shoutin' time.

Come ye weary, heavy laden
Lost and ruined by the fall
If you tarry till your better,
You will never come at all---Lyrics submitted by Shirley Wright.
