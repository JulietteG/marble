VERSE 1
We are living in a dry and thirsty land
Each day it's getting harder to cross this burning sand
Still I know there's cool, clear water up ahead
Where the dying soul of man shall soon be fed

VERSE 2
As the Bride adorned in garments white and clean
Waits with great anticipation to behold the King
The celebration has begun, and now's the time
He'll say, "Welcome, my Beloved, come and dine."

CHORUS 1
And then He'll spread the welcome table
And I'll feast on Heavenly manna
And my brand new wedding garment I shall wear
And I'll cry, "Holy, holy!"
And I'll tell the redemption story
Praise the name of the One who's worthy
And I'll shout "Hallelujah, glory!"
As we celebrate the marriage of the Lamb
And I'll cry, "Holy, holy!"
And I'll tell the redemption story
Praise the name of the One who's worthy
And I'll shout "Hallelujah, glory!"
As we celebrate the marriage of the Lamb

CHORUS 2
Then He'll spread the welcome table
I'll feast on Heavenly manna
And my brand new wedding garment I shall wear
And I'll cry, "Holy, holy!"
And I'll tell the redemption story
Praise the name of the One who's worthy
And I'll shout "Hallelujah, glory!"
As we celebrate the marriage of the Lamb
And I'll cry, "Holy, holy!"
And I'll tell the redemption story
Praise the name of the One who's worthy
Hallelujah, glory, glory
As we celebrate the marriage of the Lamb
Hallelujah, glory, glory
As we celebrate the marriage of the Lamb---Lyrics submitted by WADE L BROOKS.
