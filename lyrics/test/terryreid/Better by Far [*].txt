(Tony McCaulay , John McLeod)

It's better by far to turn and go your way with him
Stay with him and let him know the things
That I can never know the way things are ( Ooh Oh Ooh Oh )
I said it's better by far to tell myself it's been worthwhile
To try to smile and let him turn the key
To lock away this aching heart

Better by far to end this way, Call it a day with no regrets
Better by far to end it now, Forget somehow we never ever met
Whenever things are the way they are, It's better by far

Try as I may to make-believe my heart was wrong
The pain grows on, and as we say goodbye
I hold my head up high until you've gone

Better by far to end it now, Forget somehow we ever met
Better by far to stop and say, Call it a day with no regrets
While things are the way they are, It's better by far

Better by far to end this way, Forget the day with no regret
Better by far to stop and say, Call it a day we never met
While things are the way they are, It's better by far---Lyrics submitted by Stephen.
