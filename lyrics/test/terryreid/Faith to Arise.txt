Can you hear what I've been thinking
Do you hear my words out loud
Cause there's an echo that's insisting
That this here phone should ring about now
But when it does, it rings, no questions
Then when it don't, I wonder why
Maybe I'm somewhere you can't reach me 
On this dark and lonely night

But then, ooh, what a faith to arise, yeah
Feel that look in your eyes
You know a good thing could be bringing
At a time and place in your mind
You may need the laughter to hang on
To feel what it is that's alive
Well you know that it's only one more day
That I'm going to be this far away 
And now I'm sitting here on this phone
I've run out of things to say

Except it's gonna feel good just to get back home
How it's gonna feel good just to get back home
I've been out here stretching on my own
Oh, it's gonna feel good just to get back home

I take a plane out in the morning
It puts me in tomorrow night
I got something I've been saving
For the hours that I lose in this flight
There's a beauty about London
Though the rain's still falling down
It only makes me think of waking to the night 
Way the brakes could shake a ground

But then, ooh, what a faith to arise, yeah
See that look in your eyes
You know we'll be thinking of just singing
About a time and place in your mind
Your sun and your laughter growing on
To be what it is that's alive

You know that time she's a pageant of everyday
Oh what it is no one here can say
Just hanging here in the sky
With the curve of the earth in the night
Fatally seeing the return as being a reflection in your eye

That's how it's gonna feel good just to get back home
Ooh it's gonna feel good just to get back home
I've been out here stretching on my own
And now it's gonna feel good just to get back home---Lyrics submitted by David Eric.
