i can see it in your eyes, you're scared
all these things they force you to do aren't fair
i'm here to chase away these fears
baby we can chase away these fears



CHORUS
(because) sometimes baby you fall on your back
but girl you're three times the lady i'll ever have
and you know, you know it's true
this is a fight i refuse to loose

and i'll run (and i'll run)
have a little faith in me
you're scared and alone
and i'll run (and i'll run)
THis is where we both break free
i'll bring you home (you home, you home)



i can hear it in your voice, you care
let me run my fingers through your hair 
i'll keep you company at night
and baby i'm here to make this right


CHORUS
because) sometimes baby you fall on your back
but girl you're three times the lady i'll ever have
and you know, you know it's true
this is a fight i refuse to loose

and i'll run (and i'll run)
have a little faith in me
you're scared and alone
and i'll run (and i'll run)
THis is where we both break free
i'll bring you home (you home, you home)



believe me and don't think twice 
and don't leave me or say goodbye
believe me, believe me tonight
believe me and don't think twice
believeeeeee meeeeee 

and i'll run 
have a little faith in me
you're scared and alone



CHORUS
and i'll run (and i'll run)
have a little faith in me
you're scared and alone
and i'll run (and i'll run)
THis is where we both break free
i'll bring (i'll bring)  you home (you home, you home)



have a little faith in me
have a little faith in me (have a little faith, have a a little faith)
have a little faith in me (have a little faith, have a a little faith)
if you have a little faith in me---Lyrics submitted by Kristina.
