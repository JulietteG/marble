My girl wants to
Party all the time, party all the time
Party all the time
(Repeat)

{Asher Roth}
My girl, she drinks and smokes
Then she goes to fashion shows
Forth and back, back and forth
Takes the (uh) just like a pro
Try to keep on up with her but really why bother
Girls a super hottie plus she parties way harder
Still looking great with no make-up on
Keep going strong til the break of dawn
Eighth to the face, take it straight no chase
When she stray from the pace aint a damn thing wrong
Mother, sister, brother they insist on drinking water
But shes sipping on some liquor
Janice Dickinson had taught her well
Hammered, you can hardly tell
Stammered, but she hides it well
Hands up in the air and yells (party all the time)
She dance around me in her thong
Sing along, favorite song
Rip a shot, hit the bong going all night long

{Chorus}
My girl wants to
Party all the time, party all the time
Party all the time (4x)
My girl wants to

{Asher Roth}
Sorry little barbie who can hardly take a sip
Yeah, my chick be drinking whiskey just to chase it with a kiss
Then shell charge it to her card, whole bar, plus tip
Yeah for her and all her friends cause she never pays for shit
Kind of chick that you see on the TV, yeah!
Real high heels and her cleavage, yeah!
Rolling up some homegrown asking
Can we smoke some weed in here?
Isnt like she needed it but got diamonds and pearls
And definitely aint a lesbian but kisses other girls
Drives a car that isnt hers, keeps the keys up in her purse
Lipstick, red or pink, tell me which do you prefer?
Mini-skirts exotic furs wanna make the kitten purr
Try to go and buy a drink but split before you finish yours cause she

{Chorus}
My girl wants to
Party all the time, party all the time
Party all the time (4x)
My girl wants to

{Meek Mill}
Parties all the time, shorty she a dime
Ass like Nicki, barbie in her prime
Stripping on that pole, shorty on her grind
I meet her in the bathroom, dog her from behind
Its the red cup sipping, Ciroc boy mixing
Bottles of that peach got that pssy all dripping
Line goes down the street, room full of bad btches
Everybody super wasteful and them hoes is mad twisted
Asher Roth passed her off I had to ball, that ass was soft
Lyrics courtesy of Eliterics
I dribbled all on it like basketball
She nibbled all on it, I smashed Im gone
It last through the morning and on through the night
11am I was off to a flight
Land in your city its all of the lights
I got them hoes rolling like all of the dice

{Chorus}
My girl wants to
Party all the time, party all the time
Party all the time (4x)
My girl wants to---
