She struggled for most of her life
Always having to fight, and everyone has a point, when they feel like they're just breaking down.
She "I'm giving up on God, cause what has He done for me?"
She just said this because she was hurting and she knows God is forgiving.

But what if there were, no second chances?
What if "Forgive Me?" was never answered?
And what if God never sent, his Son Jesus.
If never loved us at all?

You forget that your on your own time
You act like your life is your home
Doing anything that you want to
When you know that what you have has been given to you
Yes I know God knows your heart, but when is it going to show?
I know He said, He'd always be with you, but just think if he was keeping score.

But what if there were, no second chances?
What if "Forgive Me?" was never answered?
And what if God never sent, his Son Jesus.
If never loved us at all?

Ohh, you don't have to-we don't deserve it!
But I'm so glad you do, I'm so glad He gives second chances.
And I'm so glad, my prayers were answered
And I'm so glad, He sent His son Jesus
So glad he loves me.---Lyrics submitted by Sewa.
