He is the same God
Who fights your battles
He is the same God
Who calms your fears
I will forever
Sing of His praises
Hes been that same God to me
Hes been that same God to me

When youre in trouble
He is your refuge
And when youre crying
He dries your tears
I will forever sing of His praises
Hes been that same God to me
Hes been that same God to me

And when youre lonely
He is your comfort
And when youre hurting 
He is your peace
I will forever sing of His praises
Hes been that same God to me
Hes been that same God to me

I lift my voice in
In adoration
I lift my hands in
In total praise
I will forever sing of His praises
Hes been that same God to me
Hes been that same God to me

Faithful
Lord You are
So Faithful 
Faithful to me

I will forever sing of His praises
Hes been that same God to me
Hes been that same God to me---Lyrics submitted by Carol Stephens.
