Lift your head up high and blow your brains out

do you still go to raves 
do you think Christ saves 
do you spend your days in a purple haze
do you contemplate what a grape- nut is 
or could you live drinkin' your own wiz
are you hooked on a feeling
are you hooked on gin and tonics 
are you hooked on fistin' 
are you hooked on phonix
did you ever have sex with a box of Kleenix
do you like the movie Malcom-x 
or do you own a record by Stryker
do you have a mongaloid cousin wearing diapers
where you born and raised in New Jersey 
do you like the taste of crystal Pepsi
Are you deaf
well if you are you can't hear me
but whats the use of livin' if your ears be
broken even if i spoke clearly 
you're still not able to hear me

cuz life is a game that no one wins 
but you deserve a headstart the way your lifes goin' 
so throw in the towel cuz your life ain't shit 
no take the towel and hang and hang yourself with it
lifes short and hard like a body-building elf 
so save the planet and kill yourself
if your feelin' down and out with what your life is all about 

lift your head up high and blow your brains out (x5)

does your girlfriend look like the chick from M.A.S.H.
Dead ringer for a Clinger with a thicker mustache
when you're at a get-together does everybody always ask
ain't no Halloween party why's she wearin' that mask
cuz she's got more chins than the Chinese phone-book
would you rather make out with a rusty fish hook
does she stick to linoleum when she squats
does she look pregnant although she's not 
did you first see your boyfriend on cops 
or at a star-trek convention or on top
of your best friend or maybe at Wendy's 
on a third shift late new-years eve
does he live under a bridge scare kids and kill squirrels 
does he do keg-stands until he hurls
could a blind man mistake his complexion for a Brail
does he have time to sit around and wait for the mail

cuz life is a game that no one wins 
but you deserve a headstart the way your lifes goin' 
so throw in the towel cuz your life aint shit 
no take the towel and hang and hang yourself with it
lifes short and hard like a body-building elf 
so save the planet and kill yourself
if your feelin' down and out with what your life is all about 

lift your head up high and blow your brains out (x5)

so take your life instead of takin' it for granted
I'm thinkin' you should can it
i think I'll help you plan it
live today like its gonna be your last 
hang out
with your mind
have yourself a gas

i hope you take this the wrong way and misinterpret what i say
rewind and let me reverse it backwards like Judas Priest first did

(?????????????????????????????)
(?????????????????????????????)
(?????????????????????????????)

cuz life is a game that no one wins 
but you deserve a headstart the way your lifes goin' 
so throw in the towel cuz your life ain't shit 
no take the towel and hang and hang yourself with it
lifes short and too hard like a body-building elf 
so save the planet and kill yourself
if your feelin' down and out with what your life is all about 

Lift your head up high and blow your brains out (x26)---Lyrics submitted by S.
