Watch what you say. I've got nothin' in my way.
Love what I do. What I don't do to you.

Lovely eyes they hide deep inside me!
Lovely eyes they hide deep inside me!

"Love" ain't a line, I drop often, but I've found.
That you only see, the coffin, not the seed.

I've been takin' all this time to define my mind and keep it quiet.
Right before my very eyes I looked to leap and took the dive.
Ahhh (ahhh) Ahhh (ahhh) Ahhhh 
Ahhh (ahhh) Ahhh (ahhh) Ahhhh.

It is, what it is. And you ain't on the list.
But I've, come to find, I'm often on your mind.

Lovely eyes they hide deep inside me!
Lovely eyes they hide deep inside me!

I've been takin' all this time to define my mind and keep it quiet.
Right before my very eyes I looked to leap and took the dive.
Ahhh (ahhh) Ahhh (ahhh) Ahhhh 
Ahhh (ahhh) Ahhh (ahhh) Ahhhh. X2

I've been takin' all this time to define my mind and keep it quiet. X5---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
