You need to find new ties, to cut your slow-mo.
Too quick to bind old lies, with thick as theives growth.
Quit chargin' up the credit line. And stick with what you know.
Three licks on a swingin' vine, you popped your tootsie roll.

Cuz, our love keeps our bodies movin' on.
Keeps us singin' mono-tone.
Keeps our love blood flooooow.

And I keep my legs restless, and my story untold.
No altar boy confessions, just a bright red nose.
But if you got a, new lesson? Well I'm in the need to know.
You hoot I holler blessings, from the old payphone. 

Because, our love keeps our bodies movin' on.
Keeps us singin' mono-tone.
Keeps our love blood flooooow.

Tell me, what you're thinkin' of me.
If you think you love me, keep your love lips sewwwwwn.

Ohh ohh, whatever...

You don't care about your new tattoos.
I just wanna ink beneath your tissue.
A single speed on your slow rewind who,
said our love was blind?

Because, our love keeps our bodies movin' on.
Keeps us singin' mono-tone.
Keeps our love blood flooooow.

Tell me, what you're thinkin' of me.
If you think you love me, keep your love lips sewwwwwn.

Ohhhhhhh!---Lyrics submitted by Cayson.
