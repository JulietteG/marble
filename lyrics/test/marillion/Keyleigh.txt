Do you remember chalk hearts melting on a playground wall
Do you remember dawn escapes from moonwashed college halls
Do you remember the cherry blossom in the market square
Do you remember, I thought it was confetti in our hair
By the way, didn't I break your heart
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart but you broke mine

Keyleigh, is it too late to say I'm sorry
And Keyleigh, could we get it together again
I just can't go on pretending that it came to a natural end
Keyleigh, oh I never thought I'd miss you
And Keyleigh, I thought that we'd always be friends
We said our love would last forever so how did it come to this bitter end

Oh oh yeah
Do you remember, barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars
Do you remember the loving on the floor in Belsize Park
Do you remember dancing in Stilletos in the snow
Do you remember, you never understood I had to go
By the way, didn't I break your heart
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart but you broke mine

Keyleigh, I just wanna say I'm sorry
But Keyleigh, I'm too scared to pick up the phone
To have hear you've found another lover to patch up our broken home
Keyleigh, I'm still trying to write that love song
Keyleigh, it's more important to me, now you're gone
Maybe it'll prove that we were right or it'll prove that I was wrong---Lyrics submitted by Rudy.
