You can't stop me

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Huh, can't stop won't stop, where the brakes at?
I give 'em that bee bop, like take that, take that, take that, take that
I'mma put in work, I'mma do that ASAP
Throw my faith in rap, but they say don't say that huh?
What I'mma turn down for, I feel like Shaq in nine four
Breaking glass in that backboard, or like Kobe in Toronto, huh?
Dropping 81, Yo I drop the 88, Ricky Bobby, shake and bake
Sleeping on us should have stayed awake, huh?
Everybody make mistakes like Vijay trying to say my name
It's Mineo, say it with me, Mineo - Okay great
Two forks high, raise the stakes, risk it all, I take the hate
It's the winning team, get the Gatorade
My God good, but he's not safe, nah

[Hook: Andy Mineo and Marty of Social Club]
They try to shut us down, and it ain't gon' slide
Only thing I fear is God and he on my side
That's the confidence of God, cause he got me
That's why I really feel like

You can't stop me
That's all you got? Come on with it
That's all you got?
You can't stop me

(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(Stop), that's not an option, I'm my biggest problem
(You) don't got the power, (can't) shut me down
(Stop), that's not an option
You can't stop me

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
You're my biggest opponent, you know me I know you we know it
Whenever I fail, you've always been there to simply remind me I've blown it
You don't see when I'm growing, you don't see where I'm going
You only see in the moment, you know my mistakes you never let go it
Huh, don't cease to amaze me, and it drive me crazy, huh
That you catch every detail that I miss in the songs I'm making, saying
You will never write a verse like Kendrick
Never be the rap or rock God from Hendrix
Top 10 alive you will never be mentioned
Why aim so high, won't survive the trenches
Plus, you a Christian Andy, they will never listen Andy
Plus, well your pigment Andy, huh, you don't got skill you a gimmick Andy
Well, if I listen to you, and everything you put in my ear
I'll be living like woulda, shoulda, coulda, I'll be paralyzed by fear
Huh, ain't that the truth, if I quit the only way I lose
I got two choices when I do this - make moves or make excuses
Huh, if you know who I'm talking about, then you got me
My biggest enemy is me - and even I can't stop me

[Hook]

[Bridge: Andy Mineo]
I said if I cannot stop me then you'll never stop me
Oh no, can't stop, oh no, won't stop
(x4)
