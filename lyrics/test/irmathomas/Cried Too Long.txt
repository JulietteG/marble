Theres nothing to do but walk away
Theres nothing but true, true words to say
But the truth isnt kind
It brings tears to sometimes
I may be sad but Im strong
I know Ive cried too long

Ive made up my mind
Its time to leave these tears behind
And start to believe
The bad times are gone
And Ill carry on
Though I cant right every wrong
I know Ive cried too long

Theres no place to go but up from the ground
And its gonna be harder to put me back down
But Ive found a way
To turn dark into day
Yes I knew it all along
Seems that Ive cried too long
(Repeat x2)---Lyrics submitted by B Severin.
