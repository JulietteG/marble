He's my guy...I don't care what they say about him.
He's my guy...I don't know what I'd do without him.
As long as he needs me---Right by his side I'll be
'Cause he's my guy.

I pray that we'll always be.....together.
I pray that he'll love me......forever.

No one else...could ever kiss me the way he does at night.
And no one else...could ever hold me the way he holds me tight.
As long as he wants me---Right by his side I'll be
'Cause he's my guy.

I don't care what they say
He's my guy.
I don't care what they say
He's my guy.
He's all that
He's my guy.---Lyrics submitted by Donna.
