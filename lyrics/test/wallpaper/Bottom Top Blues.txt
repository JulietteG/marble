GOT A TOLUENE TASTE
GOT A TOLUENE TASTE
GOT A VITAMIN 8
GOT IT STUCK ON YOUR FACE
NEED A SEA-SWIRL GIRL
AND ITS JUST LIKE THE OCEAN
ALWAYS IN MOTION

SEA-SWIRL AROUND N'AROUND N'ROUND N'ROUND
TILL YOU CANT TOUCH YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND
AND YOU HEAR NOTHING BUT SOUND
BOTTOM TOP BLUES DYED AND COLORED IN GOLD
POLISHED QUEEN SHIRLEY TEMPLE WAS MADE
BOTTOM TOP OUT INTO NOTHING
EVERYBODY'S WAITING FOR THE MELODY-MAN

IN A RE-RUN STATE
IN A RE-RUN STATE
GOT A MINERAL A
GOT IT SLAPPED ON YOUR FACE
NEED A SEA-SWIRL GIRL AND ITS JUST LIKE THE OCEAN
ALWAYS IN MOTION

SEA SWIRL AROUND N'ROUND N'ROUND N'ROUND
TILL YOU CANT TOUCH YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND
AND YOU HEAR NOTHIN BUT SOUND
BOTTOM BLUES DYED AND COLORED IN GOLD
POLISHED QUEEN SHIRLEY TEMPLE WAS MADE
BOTTOM TOP OUT INTO NOTHING
WELL EVERYONE IS WAITING FOR THE FATAL-TEEN-MAN.---Lyrics submitted by lonely.
