IM A BLOW TORCH TRIGGER, I AM
IM THE NEW CALIFORNIA
I AM GROWING UP
AND I HAVENT BEEN BORN YET
(HA HAAA..)

IM A BLOWN RADIATOR IN THE SUN 
YEAH IM OVERHEATIN' OVERHEATIN' 
OVERHEATIN'

ROOT ME ON RA RA
WITH THE POM POM POMPS YOURE HOLDIN
MAKE MY TONGUE TASTE NUMB 
MAKE ME STYROFOAM IN YOUR HANDS

CHORUS:
(PETE & REPEAT)---Lyrics submitted by lonely.
