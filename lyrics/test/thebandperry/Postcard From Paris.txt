I remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend, he was as sweet as he could be
One look at you and I was trough my heart switched up on me

Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from an old promise ring
Come back from your fortune teller she read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now I'm ruined, (yeah,yeaheh) I'm ruined

In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment seemed you real just like me
should've gone over, right over,
I should've never let you leave,
But it's the never knowing that keeps this going and drives me crazy

Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond was from an old promise ring
Come back from your fortune teller she read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around

Just when I thought things were alright
My eyes played tricks on my mind
Well, will I ever be satisfied cause all I seem to find

Is a postcard from Paris when I need the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond was from an old promise ring
Come back from your fortune teller she read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did, the cruelest thing, the meanest thing you ever did, is come around,
I am ruined, I'm ruined, I am ruined yeah
I'm ruined yeah---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
