Well, it's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
And keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walking

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiven
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup from some gurgling, crackling cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a roughening coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my memory
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind

Gentle on my mind
You are gentle on my mind---
