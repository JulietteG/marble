Through all of the change all stays the same
Monotonous patterns create the waves which take over shore
Leaving you lie in the wake
Through all of the change all stays the same

Your request for higher ground is everlasting
We dwell in the flatlands moving about as nomads
Higher ground is only found within
This arrives to no surprise

Still the night hears the cries of a man with a wounded passion

If this is what I seek
I shall seek no longer
The truth is wretched
The devil in disguise

Will I watch you die

If this is what I seek
Then I seek no longer
The truth is wretched
A devil in disguise

Will I watch you die

Will I watch you die

A devil in disguise

Still the night hears the cries of a man with a wounded passion

We dwell in the flatlands moving about as nomads
Higher ground is only found within
This arrives to no surprise
Still the night hears the cries

Failure is a lie---
