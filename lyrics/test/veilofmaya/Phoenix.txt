I've held it in my hands
My dismembered soul reassembles
I've held it in my hands
My dismembered soul reassembles

My dismembered soul

Take shape of which you desire
Evil lingers within each valley we pass through

I've held it in my hands

Evil lingers within everything

Hope has replenished my healing body relentless
Always in motion

Evil lingers within everything

I've seen it now, I've held it in my hands
My dismembered soul reassembles

Elevation is no escape
We send ourselves
To search for tranquility
A feeling that can't be found

Search for tranquility
A feeling that can't be found
It is fabricated through acceptance
Of a broken world

Evil lingers within everything---
