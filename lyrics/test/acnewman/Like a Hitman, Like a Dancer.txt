Like a hitman, 
oh like a dancer.
All muscle, 
all muscle.
Like the old champion, 
about to go under, 
I owe my soul,
owe my soul. 

Like a changed man,
but not a changed man,
you were gonna change sides,
but you wanted to wait, 
change sides but you wanted to wait. 

Like a fourth wall,
car chase on blue screen,
All eyes roll,
all eyes roll. 

Like a snowfall blankets the city,
swallow whole, 
swallow whole.

Like a changed man, 
but not a changed man,
you were gonna changes sides,
but you wanted to wait. 
Change sides,
but you wanted to wait.

Like a hitman, like a dancer, 
all muscle.
all muscle

Like a balancing act or a stage whisper, 
it's all I know.
it's all I know

Like a changed man 
but not a changed man,
you're gonna change sides but you wanted to wait.
change sides but you wanted to wait

Like a changed man 
but not a changed man,
you're gonna change sides but you wanted to wait.
change sides but you wanted to wait

Like a hitman, like a dancer.
Like a hitman, like a dancer.---Lyrics submitted by Kaley.
