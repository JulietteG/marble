Well I had a drink with a friend of mine 
A week ago today
We were celebrating a month and a half 
Too late St. Patty's Day
Well I bought him a round and he bought me a round
And the bouncer bought us another
What's an Irish boy from a good family 
Doing in the gutter?

Well we looked at each other and had to laugh 
Cuz we laid there in our stink
Well I would have cried if i would had thought 
But every time I thought I'd drink
And if his poor old greyed mad seen us there 
She would have shuddered
What's an Irish boy from a good family 
Doing in the gutter?

Well my Irish friend he liked to surf
But me I couldnt swim
And he said that he could teach me how 
And I swore I trusted him
He swore hed never let me drown 
He loved me like a brother
What's an Irish boy from a good family 
Doing in the gutter?

Well sure enough I drowned
And I wound up at the pearly gates
Where St. Peter said
Youre drunk as hell and son you shouldve ate
So he sent me back down to get a bite
But instead a bought another
What's an Irish boy from a good family 
Doing in the gutter? (3x)---Lyrics submitted by Antoine D.
