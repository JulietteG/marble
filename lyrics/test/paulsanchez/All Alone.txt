The emptiness is friendly and familiar
There's something broken lying on the floor
The suit of skin I'm living in from without from within
Is different than it was the year before

And I know it's not what it feels like now 
Cause it feels like I'm all alone
Yeah I know it's not what it feels like now
Cause it feels like I'm all alone
Yeah it feels like I'm all alone

Every evening waking up and waiting
To question answers given by a friend
A devil doll appears to me says life goes one way constantly
Try to keep yourself interested

And i know it's not what it feels like now 
Cause it feels like I'm all alone
Yeah I know it's not what it feels like now
Cause it feels like I'm all alone
Yeah it feels like I'm all alone

Like I'm all alone (2x)

Pouring out another cup of coffee
Lighting up the joint I left behind
The suit of skin I'm living in from without from within
Is something I will grow into in time

And I know it's not what it feels like now 
Cause it feels like I'm all alone
Yeah I know it's not what it feels like now
Cause it feels like I'm all alone
Yeah it feels like I'm all alone

Yeah i know it's not what it feels like now cause it feels like i'm all alone
Yeah it feels like I'm
Like I'm all alone like I'm all alone
That's what it feels like right now
Like I'm all alone like I'm all alone
 But it won't be that way long---Lyrics submitted by Antoine D.
