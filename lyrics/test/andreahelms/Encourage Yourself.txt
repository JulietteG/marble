Sometimes you have to encourage yourself
Sometimes you have to speak victory, during the test
And no matter how you feel, speak the word and you will be healed
Speak over yourself, encourage yourself, feel the lord

Sometimes you have to speak the word over yourself
The pressure is all around but god is present help
Enemy created walls, but remember joy ... you fall
So speak over yourself, encourage yourself, in the lord
As our minutes turn to youth, I administer to myself
Life get hard so tell your feel there's nothing left

And no matter how you feel, speak the word and you will be healed
Speak over yourself, when you're all that you have left
Tell yourself you can make it... speak over yourself
Speak over yourself...
I'm victorious...
I'm so encouraged, being ...
Just know that you can make it,
With the lord by your side you can't live
I'm encouraged, I'm encouraged
Say I am, I'm encouraged,
I am encouraged, I'm encouraged, I'm encouraged
Whoa, ... I am blessed beyond ...
The saints... has in me,
I'm encouraged, I'm encouraged, I'm encouraged...---Lyrics submitted by Cheryl Boyd.
