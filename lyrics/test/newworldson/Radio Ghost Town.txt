This is Radio Ghost Town.
Salvation plan in stereo sound.
This a rebel transmission, 
Can anybody hear me now?

Clever zombies, hidin' out in the open for all eyes to see
The resistance took a hit when our Leader was nailed to a tree.
They couldn't kill him so they're trying to tell us we're already free.

Standing outside the gate, 
Waiting in the shadows now.
No one's got time to waste,
But we don't know what to do and we don't know how
To get into that City of Gold; 
There's got to be some way around.
Trying to get out of the cold underground.

This is Radio Ghost Town
Salvation plan in stereo sound.
This a rebel transmission, 
Can anybody hear me now?

Wake up; do you know what's in your cup?
Do you know just what they're feeding you?
Mic check, I don't mean no disrespect, 
But is my transmission getting through?
I'm talkin' to you!

Standing outside the gate, 
Waiting in the shadows now.
No one's got time to waste,
But we don't know what to do and we don't know how
To get into that City of Gold; 
There's got to be some way around.
Trying to get out of the cold underground.

This is Radio Ghost Town
Salvation plan in stereo sound.
This a rebel transmission, 
Can anybody hear me now?

Standing outside the gate, 
Waiting in the shadows now.
No one's got time to waste,
But we don't know what to do and we don't know how
To get into that City of Gold; 
There's got to be some way around.
Trying to get out of the cold underground.

This is Radio Ghost Town.
Salvation plan in stereo sound.
This's a rebel transmission, 
Can anybody hear me now?

This is Radio Ghost Town.
Can anybody hear me now?

This is radio Ghost Town.
Can anybody hear me now?---Lyrics submitted by Megan Babb.
