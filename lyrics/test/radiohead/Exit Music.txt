Wake from your sleep
You're drying off your tears
Today we escape
We escape

Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell
Breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Dont lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I cant do this alone

Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
Theres such a chill, such a chill

You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom
Choke you
Now we are one
In everlasting peace

We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke---Lyrics submitted by Anahiza.
