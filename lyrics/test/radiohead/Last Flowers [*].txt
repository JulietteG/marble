Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little pond

And I can't face the evening straight
you can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief, believe, believe, believe

And I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

'Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief, believe, believe, believe
believe, believe

It's too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, hmmmm...---Lyrics submitted by Ivan.
