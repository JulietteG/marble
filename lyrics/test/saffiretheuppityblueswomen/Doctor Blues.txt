I went to see my doctor
To try to find what's wrong with me
Well I went to see my doctor
To try to find what's wrong with me
Because I got all these symptoms
And this thing is killing me

Well my doctor looked me over
To try to see what he could find
Well he really checked me out now
To try to see what he could find
When he finished up he told me
Said girl your trouble's in your mind

Well I know your heart is hurtin'
But a cardiologist won't do
Well I know you're crazy in pain girl
But no psychiatrist can help you
Well there is only one can help you
You've got to go find Dr. Blue

Well the Bluester looked me over
Checked me out from head to toe
Said I've made my diagnosis
And there's something you should know
Well the blues you've got will kill you
And they're gonna kill you slow
When it's such a bad way
Such a bad way to go

I went to see my doctor
To try to find what's wrong with me
Well I went to see my doctor
To try to find what's wrong with me
Because I got all these symptoms
And this thing is killing me

Well the Bluester looked me over
Checked me out from head to toe
Said I've made my diagnosis
And there's something you should know
Well the blues you've got are gonna kill you
And they're gonna kill you slow
When it's such a bad way
Such a bad way to go

I went to see my doctor
To try to find what's wrong with me
Well I went to see my doctor
To try to find what's wrong with me
Because I got all these symptoms
And this thing is killing me
Because I got all these symptoms
And this thing is killing me---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
