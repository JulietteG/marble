Oh there ain't no one
Who's immune to the blues
The more you get
Oh, that's the more you can lose
There's always some piece
Waitin to fall
Everybody's got his back
To some wall
There ain't no one
Who's immune to the blues

There's a Yup
Cruisin down the street
From here, you know,
His life sure looks sweet
But take a look,
Take a look at his nose
Oh I tell ya that's where
His money all goes

And there ain't no one
Who's immune to the blues

See his house
Sittin on that hill?
All those rooms
Ya wish you could fill
Six bathrooms have
Their very own phone
But that family of two
They're now sleepin alone

Hey, there ain't no one
Who's immune to the blues
The more you get
Lord, that's the more
You can lose
There's always some piece
Waitin to fall
Everybody's got his
Back to some wall
And there ain't no one
Who's immune to the blues

There that Yup pulls
His Saab in his stall
All his names
Painted right on his wall
You might think that
He's leavin his class
Well I think he's thinkin
How to cover his assets

There ain't no one
Who's immune to the blues---Lyrics submitted by Crystal Moore.
