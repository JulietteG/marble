Well I woke up this morning
I was feeling mighty bad
My baby said good morning
Hell it made me mad
Cause I'm evil hearted me
Well I'm downright evil
Evil as a woman can be

Well he even made me breakfast
Brought it right to my bed
I took a sip of coffee
Through the cup at his head
Cause I'm evil, evil hearted me
I just damn right evil
Evil as a woman can be

My soul just goes to the devil
Struggle's all I crave
I'd love to see you dead and lyin' in your grave
Cause I'm evil, evil hearted me
I just damn right evil
Evil as a woman can be

Well I don't even care if my baby leaves me flat
I got many many many others
If it comes to that
Cause I'm evil, evil hearted me
I'm just damn right evil
Evil as a woman can be---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
