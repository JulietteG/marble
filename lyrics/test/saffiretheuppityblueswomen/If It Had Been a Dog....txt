If it had been a dog
They would've gone to jail
If it had been a dog
They would've gone to jail
But when they kick and beat a colored man
Those mad men go unchained

So I say go down sunshine
See what tomorrow will bring
I say go down sunshine
See what tomorrow will bring
It might bring sunshine or fire
But if we're lucky
We gonna get rain

Now all my rage is rising
Violence, unemployment and disease
I say my rage is rising
Lynchin', rape, violence, drugs and disease
My momma's got scars on her knees
You know she's prayin'
She's prayin' for my rage to cease

She's prayin go down sunshine
See what tomorrow will bring
My momma's prayin' go down sunshine,
See what tomorrow, see what it will bring
It might bring more sunshine
It might bring fire
We pray, we pray we gonna get rain

So I say justice, justice, justice
Drop your blindfold, drop it down on the floor
I say justice justice, justice, justice, justice
Drop your blindfold down on the floor
But that lady won't be naked
A hood and a sheet will be her clothes

If it had been a dog
They would've gone to jail
I want you to see what I'm talkin' about now
I want you to picture a dog layin' on the ground
If they be kickin' on a dog
And beatin' on a dog
Kickin' on a dog
They would've gone to jail
But when they beat a colored man
This madness goes unchanged---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
