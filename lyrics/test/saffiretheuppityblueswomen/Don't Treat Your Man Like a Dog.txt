I woke up this morning
My dog was on my bed
My man was somewhere else
Just chasin' somethin' else instead
My pooch was sympathetic
He's always on my side
He's faithful and devoted
He's companion, friend and guide
Hey girl
Don't treat your man like a dog

If you need protection
If danger's lurking near
Your mutt would give his life for you
You'd never need to fear
But if your man is hangin' round
Your future may be grim
Statistics show you prob'ly
Need protection from him
Hey girl
Don't treat your man like a dog

If you treat your fellow
Like he was royalty
He'll just take you for granted you know
Most males of our species
Don't exhibit loyalty
They just tomcat wherever they go

And it's hard to find a human male
As charming as a pup
I know some who can speak and fetch
Roll over and sit up
Though they can't do tricks for you
With charm and dignity
And though they give great intellect
They lack nobility
Hey girl
don't treat your man like a dog

Well you can pamper your puppy
He'll love you just the same
He'll never ever make you pay
But if you spoil your man
You'll be chasin' after every bitch 
Who wags her tail his way

So feed your pooch Purina
And take him to the vet
Brush him when he's tangled
And dry him when he's wet
But if you want a sweetie
Who will never dog you round
Forget about the singles bars
You ought to try the pound
Hey girl
Don't treat your man like a dog
No girl
Don't treat your man like a dog---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
