I know a lot of you girls are gettin bored
You're sick and tired of being ignored
That man you've got don't appreciate you
Let me tell you honey what you oughta to do
What you need to do to get over the hump
Well don't you waste no time, you better dump that chump

Dump that chump
Dump that chump
Dump that chump
Dump that chump
Well now, lose that loser
You better listen to me

Whenever he gets ready well he goes outdoors
He don't come back but just to change his drawers
You're sittin' at home girl by yourself
While he's out with his buddies or somebody else
Your said it yourself girl more than once
You better drop that drip, you better dump that chump

Dump that chump
Dump that chump
Dump that chump
Dump that chump
Well now, lose that loser
You better listen to me

You know you're young and fine quit feeling old
That man you've got, he's got so cold
You keep on hopin' that man'll change
But the sucker hjust keeps on staying the same
Shake yourself up now, out of that slump
You gotta shad that smuck, you gotta dump that chump

Dump that chump
Dump that chump
Dump that chump
Dump that chump
Well now, lose that loser
You better listen to me---Lyrics submitted by Joel.
