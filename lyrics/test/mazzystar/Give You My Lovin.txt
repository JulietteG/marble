Give you my lovin seven days a week
I'll be your honey if you'll be sweet
I know I'm the only one for you
I know that you think this is not true
Man says it's rainin, rainin outside
I'll be out there in a little while
Cause you see, rain reminds me of you
And everything has turned to you
See you in places, I'm followin you
You'll be upstairs, and I'll be there to
Everywhere you go I will follow
I know it won't be the same tomorrow
People give me warnings, "Stay away from you
They say you'll hurt me, I don't think that's true
Discomfort arouses when I speak of you
As if you been sayin somethin bad about me
When I see you I wanna kiss you
But I know that ain't right so I'd ask if I can hold you
Oh babe, I need you so bad
Oh babe, I only wanna make you glad---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
