In the back of a car
On the road in the dark
In the stillicide, silently falling snow,
I've packed everything 
That I own in a bag
And I'm driving, I'm driving to Idaho

A poem for leaving,
A reason to go,
So I'm driving, I'm drivin' to Idaho

'Cause I can't be
Anyone but me
Anyone but me
And I can't keep
Dreaming that I'm free,
Dreaming that I'm free.
I don't want to fall asleep
And watch my life from fifty feet
My hands are on the wheel so
I'm drving to Idaho
'Cause I hear it's mighty pretty

And oh, I've been dumb
I've been prefectly beautiful
Lay on my back buying lovers with stealth
But I'm sick of you all
And I'm sick of opininon
I'm sick of this war that I wage on myself

And I don't know why
I'm so gripped to got there
A universe riddle that only I know
Mr Robert, he says
"It's all in the head,
Tell me Phaedrus, What's good? Is it Idaho?"

'Cause I can't be
Anyone but me
Anyone but me
And I can't keep
Dreaming that I'm free
Dreaming that I'm free
I don't want to fall asleep
And watch my life from fifty feet
My hands are on the wheel, so
I'm driving to Idaho
'Cause I hear it's mighty pretty
'Cause I hear it's mighty pretty

'Cause I can't be
Anyone but me
Anyone but me
And I can't keep
Dreaming that I'm free
Dreaming that I'm free
I don't want to fall asleep
And watch my life from fifty feet
My hands are on the wheel, so
I'm driving to Idaho

I don't want to fall asleep
And watch my life from fifty feet
My hands are on the wheel, so
I'm driving to Idaho
'Cause I hear it's mighty pretty---Lyrics submitted by Shannan.
