Like a shock, to my heart
When i saw, you tonight
Like a dream, come alive
For the very first time

When we touch, in the dark
Baby you live alone i my mind
Wish I could freeze you and me
In this moment in time

You got it, what I want
Give it up shawty
Step it up, for me
And i'll give you everything
All my life, all my love, ill give you my fortune and fame
I'd even give you my name

Girl you take me hiiiiiighhher
Then i've ever been before, my feet don't touch the floor
We'll flyyyyy, The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

Girl you take me up up up, uuuuup up up, uuuuup up 
Girl you take me up
You take me hiiiiiighhher, The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

When we dance, when we kiss
Doesn't get any better than this
How you shine, droppin the spotlight
Finally mine, yeaah

Baby lets go, lets get outta here
Baby let go, got nothin to fear
And now that we're here, lets disappear
Into the night

You got it, what I want
Give it up shawty
Step it up, for me
And i'll give you everything
All my life, all my love, ill give you my fortune and fame
I'd even give you my name

Girl you take me hiiiiiighhher
Then i've ever been before, my feet don't touch the floor
We'll flyyyyy, The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

Girl you take me up up up, uuuuup up up, uuuuup up 
Girl you take me up
You take me hiiiiiighhher, The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

(oooohwoooohwoooohwoooh)

My feet are on the ceiling 
And they dont wanna touch the ground anymore
Oh what a feel, i could feel, can you feel it feel it feel it

Girl you take me hiiiiiighhher
Then i've ever been before, my feet don't touch the floor
We'll flyyyyy, The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

Girl you take me up up up, uuuuup up up, uuuuup up 
Girl you take me up
You take me hiiiiiighhher, The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

oooooowooahh ohhh---Lyrics submitted by Lucy.
