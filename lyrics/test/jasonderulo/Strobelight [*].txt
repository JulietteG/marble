Like a Strobe Light Light Light Light x2
I can't see you babe,
I feel you,
Lost in this place till i found you,
Playin' hard to get, I I know this game,
Turning me on,
Switch it off again.

One moment your gone
The next you are here
Like smoke in my arm
You just disappear
One moment your here
Then you flash away
Let's just start again
I I want you to stay

Strobe Light
Drop in your arms
Like a strobe light
See like your doing me wrong
And if I can get for a second,
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light
Drop in your arms
Like a strobe light light light light x2

Is this a dream?
Are you really there?
A trick of the eye,
I I, I saw you, I swear,
One touch not enough,
Wanna dance with chu all night
But you keep me n keep me in the half line

Your running again,
Like thos in a race,
Is it love that you want?
Or just the thrill of the chase,
One moment your here,
Then you flash away,
Let's just start again,
I I want you to stay,

Strobe Light,
Drop in your arms,
Like a strobe light,
See like your doing me wrong,
And if I can get for a second,
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light,
Drop in your arms,
Like a Strobe Light light light light x2

If the lights were on
I hold you body
(If you get this moment)
Get thing sorted
(Would you take it off and)
Immmm
(Would you take it off)
Immmm
(I just want to tell you)
Immmm
(Take it off)

Like a Strobe Light
(Put your hands up x2)
Like a Strobe Light
(Put your hands up x3)

Strobe Light
Drop in your arms
Like a strobe light
See like your doing me wrong
And if I can get for a second,
All the sex you be getting like a strobe light
Drop in your arms
Like a strobe light light light light x2
(Put your hands up x2)---Lyrics submitted by Savie.
