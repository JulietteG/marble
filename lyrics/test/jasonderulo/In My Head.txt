Come on.

Everybodys looking for love. Oh. Oh.
Aint that the reason youre at this club. Oh. Oh.
You aint gonna find it dancing with him. No. Oh.
I got a better solution for you girl. Oh. Oh.

Just leave with me now. Say the word and well go.
Ill be your teacher. Ill show you the ropes.
Youll see a side of love youve never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
Youll be screaming out.
In my head, its going down.
In my head, its going down.
In my head. Yeah. In my head. Oh yeah.

Some dudes know all the right things to say.
When it comes down to it, its all just game.
Instead of talking let me demonstrate. Yeah.
Get down to business and skip foreplay.

Just leave with me now. Say the word and well go.
Ill be your teacher. Ill show you the ropes.
Youll see a side of love youve never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
Youll be screaming out.
In my head, its going down.
In my head, its going down.
In my head. 

Break it down. Ay-oh. Come on. Ay-oh. Ay-oh. 
You singing to me baby in my head right now. Ay-oh. Ay-oh. Come on.
Shell be screaming out when it all goes down.

Just leave with me now, Say the word and well go. We can go.
Ill be your teacher. Ill show you the rodes.

Youll see a side of love youve never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
Youll be screaming out.
In my head, its going down.
In my head, its going down.

In my head, I see you all over me. 
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
Youll be screaming out.
In my head, its going down.
In my head, its going down.
In my head.
