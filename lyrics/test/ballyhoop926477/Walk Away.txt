So here we are again  
In fisticuffs just like last week  
You got your brass knuckles and I got a machete  
Not too long ago we used to cuddle in our sleep  
Somehow this shit got turned around  
And now the words cut deep  

All the love letters  
Stuffed into a Molotov cocktail  
Sometimes it's easier to walk away (walk away)  
Call it what it is  
This is hopeless  
Well can't you see that girl, life goes on (life goes on)  
And we've seen better days  
And you know this  
Girl we just can't take much more   
You know we make each other miserable  
Let's just call it what it is  
Letting go  
Of all of this 

I remember asking all around to get your name  
And I wish I could find out that you were doing the same  
Now it seems as those old days have come and gone away  
But I would never call this a mistake  

All the love letters  
Stuffed into a Molotov cocktail  
Sometimes it's easier to walk away (walk away)  
Call it what it is  
This is hopeless  
Well can't you see that girl, life goes on (life goes on)  
And we've seen better days  
And you know this  
Girl we just can't take much more   
You know we make each other miserable  
Let's just call it what it is  
Letting go  
Of all of this 

All the love letters  
Stuffed into a Molotov cocktail  
Sometimes it's easier to walk away (walk away)  
Call it what it is  
This is hopeless  
Well can't you see that girl, life goes on (life goes on)  
And we've seen better days  
And you know this  
Girl we just can't take much more   
You know we make each other miserable  
Let's just call it what it is  
Letting go  
Of all of this---
