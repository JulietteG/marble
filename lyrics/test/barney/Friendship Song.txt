[Barney]
Friends are special, so important they make the world go 'round

[Kids]
We like helping one another at school or on the playground
Friends are there to help each other when one is feeling sad
Being friends is very special be a friend and you'll be glad

[Kids & Barney]
Friends are special, so important they make the world go 'round
We like helping one another at school or on the playground
Friends are there to help each other when one is feeling sad
Being friends is very special be a friend and you'll be glad [x2] ---Lyrics submitted by taylor howell.
