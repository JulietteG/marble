Well I know there's a reason 
And I know there's a rhyme 
We were meant to be together 
That's why ... 
We can roll with the punches 
We can stroll hand in hand 
And when I say it's forever 
You understand ... 

That you're always in my heart, 
You're always on my mind 
But when it all becomes too much, 
You're never far behind 
And there's no one that comes close to you 
Could ever take your place 
Cause only you can love me this way 

I could have turned a different corner 
I could have gone another place 
Then I'd of never had this feeling 
That I feel today, yeah.. 

And you're always in my heart, 
Always on my mind 
When it all becomes too much, 
You're never far behind 
And there's no one that comes close to you 
Could ever take your place 
Cause only you can love me this way 

Ooooh... 

And you're always in my heart, 
You're always on my mind 
And when it all becomes too much, 
you're never far behind 
And there's no one that comes close to you 
Could ever take your place 
Cause only you can love me this way 

Ooooh... 

Only you can love me this way.---Lyrics submitted by Spenser.
