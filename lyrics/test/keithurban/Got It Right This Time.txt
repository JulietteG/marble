She believes in me like I've been trying to do
And she'd think I've never seen the cold
Ever since she came into my life
I've been a better man

Run, run running, I was running scared
Always looking for a place to leave
Couldn't seem to find where I belonged
Til she took my hand

We can make this work out, baby
I know it's true
I picture myself getting old with you
And I think I got it right this time
Oh, yeah

All of my life I've been looking for someone
Who believes in love the way I do
Know I made several big mistakes

But girl I promise you

We can make this work out, baby
I know that it's true
I picture myself getting old with you
And I think I got it right this time

True believers always find each other and here we are
Always knew that you were out there just waiting on me
For me to find my way, find my way to your heart
Oh, yeah

We can make it work out, baby
I know it's true
Can picture myself getting old with you
And I think I got it right this time

Yeah, after all the crazy days
Made it through
I can't picture myself with no one but you
And I think I got it right this time---Lyrics submitted by Candy.
