Raise em' up 
I'm talkin' 'bout lighter on a Saturday night 
The band plays a song you like 
And you sing along 

Raise em' up 
I'm talkin' bout daddy's old pick up truck 
Shot gun seat there's the one you love 
And you're kissin' on 

Get those white sails flowin' down in Mexico 
It's just a whiskey glass 
If you ain't makin' a toast 
Lift those tear filled eyes 
Up to the sky 
Comin' home you've been gone too long 
Tonight we're gonna 
Raise em' up 

Raise em' up 
You've gotta voice, you've gotta choice 
Go make some noise 
Don't ever let em' tell you 
Who you are 

Raise em' up 
Fist black and blue 
Fight for the truth 
It's what you do 
Hand on your heart 
For the strips and stars 

Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain 
Sunday morning coming down 
Amazing Grace 
Lift those tear filled eyes up to the sky 
And as the flag flies say goodbye 
Tonight we're gonna raise em' up 

So you meet someone 
The only one 
You take her by the hand 
Make a stand 
By some land 
Make some love 
And then babies come 
Raise em' up---
