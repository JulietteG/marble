Alone in this house again tonight
I've got the tv on, sound turned down
And a bottle of wine.
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me.
The ways that it was and could've been surrounds me.
I'll never get over you walking away.

*Chorus*
And I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show.
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control.
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain,
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain from my eyes.
Tonight I wanna cry.

Would it help if I turned this sad song on?
All by myself would sure hit me hard now that you're gone.
Or maybe unfolds some old, yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way.

(*Chorus*)

'Cuz I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show.
And i thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control.
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain,
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain from my eyes.
Tonight I wanna cry.---Lyrics submitted by LESLIE.
