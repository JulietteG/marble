I used to cry out in the middle of the night
Baby hold me tight
But there was nobody beside me
When I opened my eyes
Now I've turned a corner on those days and nights
And something inside me is changing
I think I might be starting over
And I don't wanna run
Oh no 'cause you might be the one, baby

Chorus:
If ever I could love
I think it could be with you
If ever I thought I'd
Found somebody so true
I wonder if you feel 
The same way that I do
If ever I could love 
I think it could be with you

You know I can't read your mind my love
But it seems to me
That your heart and mine tonight are
Defying gravity
There's something so familiar and still so unknown
But the closer that we get I swear it feels like coming home
And I'm ready to be brave
Oh yeah then you look at me and say baby

Chorus

Hmmm, no
If ever I could love, baby
If ever I could love
If ever I could love, I think it could be
If ever I could love, oh yeah I know it baby

Chorus

If ever I could love (x4)

I was scared to love again
Feel the pain that came
When she walked out of my life
I hurt so bad I swore I'd never let another
Get inside this heart of mine
But you touched my hand and every plan that I had
Disappeared like a falling star
And there's a new beginning and I'm 
Movin to the rhythm of a beating braver heart, braver heart---Lyrics submitted by Treana.
