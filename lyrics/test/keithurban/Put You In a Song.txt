Well here you come again and you looking so fine
You don't know it's me but it's alright
I'm just a guy who wishes that I can be a man someday

Yeah, a picture paints a thousand words, it's true
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you
I want to put you in a melody
I gotta set you to a groove

I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up real loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I love this girl

If I could press play, repeat, how happy I'd be
Whenever I go out I'd have you there with me
You'll be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song.

Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight
And it would be so easy
I'd just write it from my heart

'Cuz I gotta tell the world what you mean to me
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be stuck in my head all day
'Cuz your already there anyway
Yes you are

I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up real loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I love this girl

If I could press play, repeat, how happy I'd be
Whenever I go out I'd have you there with me
You'll be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song.

And if I get it right everybody will be singing along
(Oh yeah)  And when they see you on the street, they'll say 
"Hey! Aren't you that girl in that song?"

I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up real loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out  
I'm in love with this girl

Yeah, if I could press play, rewind, a couple million times
Imagine for a moment that you're all mine.
Every night I'd drive you home
If I could put you in a...let me put you in a song

Let me put you in a song
Oh a pretty little song about you baby---Lyrics submitted by Lisa.
