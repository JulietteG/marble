What you heard is true
the disappointing truth is
I don't like to lose
Shame on me, shame on me
Promises I've made and bills I never paid
Another missed birthday,
Shame on me, shame on me.
Bridges that I burned and lovers that I hurt
Lessons never learned
Shame on me, shame on me.

(Chorus)
Hey, I'm not tryin to be perfect
It's not like it's worth it
Everyone hurts the same

Hey, I'm not tryin to be special
Cause I ain't no angel
Everyone hurts the same
What a shame.

I repeat my words
Sometimes they seem rehearsed
And I speak out of turn
Shame on me, shame on me

Bridges that I burned
And lovers that I hurt
And lessons never learned
Shame on me, shame on me

Repeat Chorus

That we're hiding underneath our skin
And we're scared of letting somebody in
Nobody showed us how to live

Or how to be perfect 
It's not like it's worth it

Repeat Chorus Twice---Lyrics submitted by Amelia Mohundro.
