Another long summer's come and gone
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides 
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight

But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out I kissed your mouth
No fourth of July has burned so brightly
You had to go I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander around this town 
Til summer comes around

I got a job working at the old Park Pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks
And I count the days til you just might come back

Then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out I kissed your mouth
No fourth of July has burned so brightly
You had to go I understand
But you swore that you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
Til summer comes around

And I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on the ferris wheel rocking with the motion
We're hand and hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl if only for a moment
"And maybe I'll be back again"
You whispered in my ear
And the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
Til summer comes around
Til summer comes around---Lyrics submitted by Steve.
