Oooh Ooh
Oooh Ooh
Oooh Ooh
....

Now that I'm wandering out and on my own;
Take more than a family for me to call this place my home.
A mother's ears hear a thousand miles so I do not make a sound.
Walk inside my own shadow with my hands over my mouth
And be quiet.

Now that the day is done, and the sun is on it's fall -
Wonder as I wonder, how am I alive at all?
What did it take to get me here? What will it take to leave?
Fall in love and then I hate everything I see.

When I'm tired I hit the floor; when I'm upset I go to the bar.
There's nowhere, nothing, and no one more
As warm as the strength of your arms.

Become what? Become what? Become who you are.
I remember you well beneath that silver bell,
The one that you wore around your heart.

Let us meet one day beneath that silver shade,
the one that was there at the start.
At the start.

Oooh Ooh
Oooh Ooh
Oooh Ooh
Oooh Ooh

Now that I'm wandering out and on my own -
Take more than a family for me to call this place my home.
