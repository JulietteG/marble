I know this place can often be a fucking drag
Hanging out with wusses everybody's trying to get laid
But that's the problem with everybody's head
They chew you up and then they spit you back out dead

Well, I know how it feels to be a guy who walks alone
When everybody wants to shut you down

I don't believe in anything you fucking say
Cause your opinion don't mean nothing to me anyway
But that's the problem with everybody's head
They chew you up and then they spit you back out dead

I know how it feels to be a guy who walks alone
When everybody wants to shut you down
I know how it feels when everybody says you're wrong
When everybody wants to shut you down

Hey, Don't need no one
Hey, Don't want no one
Hey, Don't need no one
Hey, Don't want no one

The next time someone tries to get inside your head
Just tell them to go to hell and kiss my fucking ass

Well, I know how it feels to be a guy who walks alone
When everybody wants to shut you down
I know how it feels when everybody says you're wrong
When everybody wants to shut you down
Everybody wants to bring you to your knees---Lyrics submitted by Thomas Adams.
