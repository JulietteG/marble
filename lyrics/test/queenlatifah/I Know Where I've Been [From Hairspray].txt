There's a light 
In the darkness 
Though the night 
Is black as my skin 
There's a light 
Burning bright 
Showing me the way 
But i know where iv'e been 

There's a cry 
In the distance 
It's a voice 
That comes from deep within 
There's a cry 
Asking why 
I pray the answer's up ahead 
'Cause i know where i've been 

There's a road 
We've been travelin' 
Lost so many on the way 
But the riches 
Will be plenty 
Worth the price the price we 
Had to pay 

There's a dream 
In the future 
There's a struggle 
That we have yet to win 
And there's pride 
In my heart 
'Cause i know 
Where I'm going 
And i know where iv'e been 

There's a road 
We must travel 
There's a promise 
We must make 
'Cause the riches 
Will be plenty 
Worth the risk 
And chances that we take 
There's a dream 
In the future 
There's a struggle 

That we have yet to win 
Use that pride 
In our hearts 
To lift us up 
To tomorrow 

'Cause just to sit still 
Would be a sin 

I know where I'm going 

And lord knows i know.. 
Where Iv'e been 

Oh! When we win, 
I'll give thanks to my god 
'Cause i know where Iv'e been---Lyrics submitted by Melody.
