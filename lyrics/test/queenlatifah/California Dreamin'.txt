All the leaves are brown
And the sky is grey
I went for a walk
On a winters day
I'd be so safe and warm
If I was in L.A.

California dreamin
on such a winters day

I stopped in a church, yes I did
That I passed along the way
And I got down on my knees, down on my knees
And I pretend to pray
You know the preacher like the cold
Cause he knows I'm gonna stay, cause he knows I'm gonna stay

California dreamin
on such a winters day O O yea

All the leaves are brown
And the sky is so grey
I went for a walk
On a cold winters day, yea
I'd be so safe and warm
If I was in L.A.

But california dreamin
On such a winters day
On such a winters day
On such a winters day

California, california dreamin
California dreamin

Play that for me

You know it's just a dream

Dream on
