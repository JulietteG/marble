Hey Mami x4
Hey Mami, You sexy x3
Hey Mami, you beautiful
Hey Mami you sexy x3
Hey Mami, can I get that number?
(repeat twice)

Big hot pockets, feya, ugly
Corny, busted, chopped, straight fugly
British guys playing rugby
Brooklyn boys who wanna thug me
Skanky, cranky, foogly, oogly
Slammin dudes who wanna do me
G'Doonk G'Doonk, skoonky, flavors
Bangin, mega hot, dumb haters

Country boys and them boys in the city
Buy me lunch and make me all giddy
Sparkling clean, dirty, grimey and gritty
Big muscle men and a little itty bitty
Some look so good and some need a little work
Some know what they gotta do to make me smirk
Ralph, Donna, Marc, and my man Tommy
Better go get that girl, Hey Mami

Hey Mami, You sexy x3

Yeah Yeah Thats what they shout
On the street when I strut when I walk to the store
They wanna turn me out
Hootin and hollerin
Ring around the collar and
This ain't Scores and
You ain't wavin a dollar and

You better tighten up that game
Theres a million other guys tryin to get with us
And you all sound the same
You should slow it on down papi
You sound like a carbon copy
I wanna a man whos smooth, got all the right moves 
But you're just plain sloppy

Repeat Chorus---Lyrics submitted by katie.
