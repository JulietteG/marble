We got money in our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on 
Red-bottom limping around this bitch 
What the fuck you tripping on? 
Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone 
And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong 
We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch 
We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English 
Let's toast it up to that life and I mean it 

We in this bitch, we in this ho 
I got the.40 on me now, who wants to Plaxico? 
Shout to Gangsta Gibbs, he the next to blow 
You should see my gangster grill, I light the shit from blow 
Snowy car transforming instead of transformer 
You ever cook the whole thing on a George Foreman? 
What about a nine on the gas grill? 
Four-fifty for the silk, pay my gas bill 
So many horses in the rari, park it in the barn 
Took the ice up out my cup and put it in my charm 
And this bad bitch with me from another planet 
Stay on the satellite phone, man, I can't stand it 
Hey baby girl, hang the phone up 
No talking with your mouth full, you's a grown-up 
What the fuck? Who the hell? 
Flashback in this bitch, thought I seen a scale 

You know how we handle shit, gangster gutter glamorous 
Zone One Atlanta shit, over all the amateurs 
I'm walking off in here, a boss so, dog, approach with caution though 
Disrespect is tolerated, that's some shit you ought to know 
Niggas say they ball, yeah, but I'm balling harder though 
Cold as the nose on a Appalachian Eskimo 
It finna go down, ho, popping bottles, drown hoes 
Paid niggas with us, ain't no broke niggas around so 
Excuse me, who is he? I don't do this usually 
But I'm too fresh to fight, somebody go and get security 
I'm buying this, buying that, getting that check and flyin jet 
Boucheron, Constantine, Puff like, where you find that? 
American at the nature, boy, a lot of nigga hate your boy 
Pocket full of money, got more paper than a paperboy 
Future, Jeezy, Cris, and Drama 
Tip say, let's go get it popping 

I'm popping plenty bottles, like I got plenty bricks 
Call me Mr. Marcus, I'm in this bitch 
Super drink, super smoke and some super hoes 
VIP looking like we won the fucking Superbowl 
Thirsty chicks trying to give it, I don't want it 
You been in more laps than the Indy 500 
Conjure's what we drinking, faded til the world end 
Never see me planking, unless I'm on your girlfriend 
Ludacris, I been a staple in this Southern game 
Got the best lines, so I guess I'm slinging Southern caine 
My money's louder, you rappers need to hush more 
My presidents rock, my accounts are Mount Rushmore 
On the island and my phone is hitting dead spots 
Altoid can of blue pills, that's my X-box 
You could hate, you could dis, you could make a wish 
But eight albums, and Luda's still in this bitch---
