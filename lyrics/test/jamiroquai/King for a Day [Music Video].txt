That's the way love goes
There's no way
I'm coming back to you
I've just got to say
That everything we did is through
You tried to undermine
The better ranges of my nature
But soon your going to find
You should have started talking straighter
Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
I'm in no hurry, baby
To see you go to ground
Because it's true what they say
You know it's true what they say
Your only king for a day
I guess your happy that way

Well there's no hope
For peace and reconciliation
You're quick to play your hand
But what you haven't learnt is patience
So look before you leap
To tell the world your coloured story
It's clear your talk is cheap
You'd do anything to get your glory
So spread your wings and fly
There is no doubt
You're so sorry inside you've got something to shout about
Because it's true what they say
You know it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way

And there's no love
Ever to be lost between us
I guess this is because
The damage that you've done is so grievous
So I hang my head
To dwell on what might have been
But what you left instead
Is pieces of a broken dream

Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
I'm in no hurry
To see you go to ground
Because it's true what they say
You know it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way

So spread your wings and fly
There is no doubt
You're so sorry inside you've
Got something to shout about

Because it's true what they say
You know it's true what they say
Your only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way

Don't you see that your only king for a day
You must believe that..---Lyrics submitted by C..
