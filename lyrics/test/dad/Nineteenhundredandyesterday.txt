I let a lie come true 
I even cared enough to lie 
Recieve what I transmit 
And slowly close your eyes 
Yeah, to unlock your locked up love 
And set it free 
You need a complicated key 
You need a key as big as me .. 

You were almost on my mind 
Yeah, and though I'm doing just fine 
I've hurt myself in many ways 
Back in nineteenhundredandyesterday 
Yeah, I think of you every time 
Every time I leave it behind - 
Back in nineteenhundredandyesterday 

And when I lie in bed 
And I'm going through the day 
What's been done and said 
It slips into my head 
You open up one door 
And then you're faced with many more 
Yeah, I know all of them well 
I keep my questions to myself 

You were almost on my mind ... 

Hey, I thought I wanted it 
I thought I needed it 
To unlock your locked up love 
You left the key and then you walked off 

You were almost on my mind ...---Lyrics submitted by Brian.
