[Refrain]:
So I sing you a song,
  Maybe I'll travel
Winds glide me over
  The Rockies 'twards home

And find me a lover 
  I can lay next to 
     And Maybe, then I'll lose the pain

Verse 1:
Loneliness is all that I'm feeling
  As I get older it visits more often
    Hiding when my friends are around

With laughter and drink,
  This feeling I'll drown
    This feeling, I'll drown

Verse 2:
Homesick for the warm sunny weather
  My family, the country, the Golden Gate bridge
    I think of the days I once lived there

I've spent too much time here,
  No more can I bear
    No more can I bear

Verse 3:
Anxious when I think of the future
  Afraid of mistakes I make in my life
    I'm moved by the planets and forces

Do I rule my own life
  Or is it destiny's course?
    Destiny's course...

So I sing you a song,
  Maybe I'll travel
Winds glide me over
  The Rockies 'twards home

And find me a lover 
  I can lay next to 
     And Maybe, then I'll lose the pain

That's makin' me blue, that's makin' me blue
  Ooo ooo ooo, ooooooooo, ooooooooo- ooo (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Greenie Glen.
