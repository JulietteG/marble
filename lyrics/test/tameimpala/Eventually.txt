If only there could be another way to do this
Cause it feels like murder
To put your heart through this
I know I always said that I could never hurt you
Well this is the very very last time I'm ever going to ...

But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too
Said, I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too

Eventually
Eventually

Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
Cause If I was never in your life
You wouldn't have to change this

But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too
Said, I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too

Eventually
Eventually

And I know just what I've got to do
And it's got to be soon
Cause I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too

Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually---
