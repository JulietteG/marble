It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, no no, not if it
Feels like we only go backwards darling

I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day 
Then I realize I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe your feelings don't show

It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, no no, not if it
Feels like we only go backwards darling

Sea of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
Cause I decided long ago if that's the way it seems to go
We draw us apart to get to something real, it feels

It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, no no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, no no, not if it
Feels like we only go backwards darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, no no, not if it
Feels like we only go backwards darling---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
