It's been a while since I've seen you're face
Gotta say that Im happy to see you come around my place 
Now I think we've talked about it, and I
I think I know what's comin up next
So lets put our minds away and let our horomones do the rest
Does it seem obseen? Does it seem like a bad thing?
Well if it is Im sorry, Miss but you know Im just 19.
So dont be afraid when my pants start to leak
You know damn well Im in my sexual peak well...

[chorus] Why dont you have some dirty hot sex with me?
It aint like im asking you to give it up for free
Oh we can start it right now, baby get on your knees
Dont make me beg again, well girl I just said please

Now when you look down, dont be misled
I've found my life's purpose and its getting upstairs
into your bed now
So there's the phone girl, go right on ahead
Im sure you'd rather be with your stupid boyfriend instead

[short skit]

...why you gotta... sleep with my dad??

[chorus]

Baby get on your knees.... oh yea, oh yea...
Im beggin you darlin, please... oh yea, oh yea...
please....please.....please me.---Lyrics submitted by allison.
