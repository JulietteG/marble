Your calling, your asking 
If things have changed 
Your sinking, and wishful thinking
So you'll unforget my name
Because I'v been a fool to all your rules 
Given all you asked me to
But the time apart has made me who I now am, Im not you
Cause all that you've done is undone 
And now Im just a shirt that you sleep in
Let go of me, of my friends, everything
Cause I'll never feel like I use too..... Like I use too

Im staying, not complaining 
The love is gone
Theres no use we both lose
And its time that you've moved on
Cause theres nothing more you can do 
And what stopped me is what stopped you
And the more you try, the more I knew who I am, Im not you 
Cause all that you've done is undone 
And now Im just a shirt you sleep in
Let go of me, of my friends, everything
Cause Ill never feel like I use too 

Here in the now if you look, yeah you wont find me
Time has a way to repair everything, so... oh
Cause all that youve done is undone
And now Im just a shirt that you sleep in
Let go of me, of my friends, everything, everything, everything
Cause Ill never feel like I use too
Cause all that youve done is undone (All that you've done)
And now Im just a shirt that you sleep in ( Now Im just a shirt)
Let go of me, of my friends, everything, everything, everything
Cause I'll never feel like I use too.. OH,oh,OH,oh,OH---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
