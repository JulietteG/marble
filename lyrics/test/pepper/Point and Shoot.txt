I'm exactly where I want to be
Like a theif inside a robbery 
Listening to pirate radio
Imagine that i'm in the show
Empty sky but im still composed
Take some time for these sexy episodes where

Pussy licking, pussy licking me oh I, I
I see a photo opportunity
Now lick your lips and shake your hips 
'cause thats the shit now lover
Let the liquor help you get on it

Now this room is getting loud
Must keep an eye now, three is a crowd so

Pussy licking, pussy licking me oh I, I
I see a photo opportunity
Now lick your lips, shake your hips
'cause thats the shit now lover
Let the liquor help you get on it, 
Let the liquor help you get on it 

If you wanted to, you could do like me
Several times, i know im lucky to be
In the mix but still composed
Lost inside these kicky episodes

Pussy licking, pussy licking me oh I, I
I see a photo opportunity oh
Now lick your lips, shake your hips
'cause thats the shit now lover
Let the liquor help you get on it, 
Let the liquor help you get on it oh

Woah you, you should imagine
All that these eyes yah, 
all these eyes have ever seen---Lyrics submitted by Joana Perez.
