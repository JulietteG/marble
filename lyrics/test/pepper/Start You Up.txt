There's always more than just one place to find me
And if you can't, all you gotta do is call
I can't sleep when I'm feeling that feeling
I know you know I want it all

Full top my mind, it won't stop, just keeps on knockin'
Can't shut it down with the push of a button
Cause I need that one thing I'm missing
So I won't you let me

Start you up
Move a little bit closer
If I start you up
And do whatever with me
When I start you up
Cause I know you'll keep on comin'
And comin' and comin'
Back for more

Just a matter of time to seal it
That's my answer waiting if you asked
A liquid measure could help reveal it
You know I know we'll make it last

It's time your mine, it won't stop, just keeps on knockin'
Cant shut it off with the push of a button
Cause you need that one thing you're needin'
And I'm here, if you want me to

Start you up
Move a little bit closer
If I start you up
And do whatever with me
When I start you up
Cause I know you'll keep on comin'
And comin' and comin'
Back for more

Start you up
If I start you up
When I start you up
I know you'll keep on comin'
And comin' and comin'
Back for more

Come on, girl
Start you up
Back for more
Come on, girl
Start you up
Back for more
Come on, girl
Start you up
(I'm comin')
Back for more
Come on, girl
Start you up
(I'm comin')
Back for more---
