its been so long
its hard to breathe when the trust is gone
your face is still
it just melts away
you've got a lot to wait
just wait 
if you've got a lot to say 
just say it
arnt you tired of wasting fuel
so now i hand the fuse to you
burn it up
let's burn it up
its done 
its done
its in the past
its ashes
im tired of you
you're tired of me---Lyrics submitted by Sonia.
