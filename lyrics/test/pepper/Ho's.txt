I've been
waiting all this time
so visiting is my one crime
take a step which way to go
with no premission from a ho
and i live with no disease
my bad seed's got remedies
i'll be part of history 
with 15 books on my story

and be a swift like roddigan
equipped with the best selection
wondering what you use 
slipping off the booze cruise
and your focus turns to blur
when you set your eyes on her
cause i turn away when 
she looks at me

and im  a-watchin watchin
you walik away
ho, i'll try to meet you by the old highway
ooh and if it's now i've gone to slack
with the sun shone across my back
and i'm confident to know 
that you're backstage at my show ahh

(melody)

why am i so short of your attention
having this discussion downtown
oooh 
no obligation 
it's a real hard emotion
now that you're gone
I'm moving right along as I...

run down the roots
still viewing sluts, bowcats 
these ho's tring to fool me
no promises you got hat one time slap
seductive sexy capers in the hilton tram
with this abuse of napkins
X-mount of Hieniken
waking up's so hard to do
when i'm lying next to you
so i'm knocking at your door complicates the night before
she says the joke is on me 
i said the joke is on her

mary oh mary still so
quite contrary
how could you
ever knooooowww ahhhhhh

and im a-watchin watchin you walk away
ho, i'll try to meet you by the old highway
oooh
and if it's now i've cut to slack
with the sun shown across my back 
and im confident to know
that you're backstage at my door ahhhh
and im a (now that you're gone) watchin watchin you walk away 
hhhhhmmmmmm
and im a watchin watchin (oh yeah) you walk away
oooohh
and im a-(now that you're gone)you walk away
hhhhhmmmmmm
and im a-watchin a-watchin (oh yeah)---Lyrics submitted by trevor.
