Girl you know I'll always be there
Despite the rumors you hear
I'll be by your side
And no one could ever break-up
Despite what they make up
No river runs dry

When we met last spring I said it was a good day
I acted a little shy but nothing foolish
Your friends said don't talk to me because I'm "no one"
Little did they know of me boy they were wrong

Don't you know
Don't you know said I really wont go 
Don't you know I'm staying for the long haul
Don't you know said I really wont go 
Don't you know I'm staying for the long haul
And as I see your face my temperature will rise 
And I cant say the words good bye
We can make it work as long as you try
You and me will be alright

We couldn't be apart we couldn't do it
I loved your from the start and wanted was to prove it
Your dad said done talk to me because I'm "no one"
He said the crush would be gone in a week
But he was wrong---Lyrics submitted by Nicolas.
