So I've been thinking
About my heart that's waiting
Just waiting to find a place
And I know you're out there
Just waiting to be found
I just want to see your face
Will your eyes be blue like the color of the sea
Or brown like the leaves that fall from the tree
Will you love me in the morning
Before I go to work?

I want to hold I want to kiss
I want to love I want to squeeze you
And in the bedroom girl you know I'm gonna please you
I want to hold I want to kiss I want to squeeze you
Yeah you 

Too many days and too many nights
Too many days and too many nights
Too many days and too many nights
Too many days and too many nights
Is much too many times

And I know from yesterday
Most things aren't here to stay
But with love will find a way
To weather through he seasons
After our first meeting
I love a girl I've yet to meet
For what but no good reason
Will your smile be so bright 
To light up my life?
Will your skin be soft when you clothes come off?
Will you love me in the morning
Before I go to work?

I want to hold I want to kiss
I want to love I want to squeeze you
And in the bedroom girl you know I'm gonna please you
I want to hold I want to kiss I want to squeeze you
Yeah you 

Too many days and too many nights
Too many days and too many nights
Too many days and too many nights
Too many days and too many nights
Is much too many times---Lyrics submitted by Nicolas.
