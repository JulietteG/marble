I feel I know you
I don't know how
I don't know why

I see you feel for me
You cried with me
You would die for me

I know I need you
I want you to
Be free of all the pain
You hold inside

You cannot hide
I know you tried
To be who you couldn't be
You tried to see inside of me

And now I'm leaving you
I don't want to go
Away from you

Please try to understand
Take my hand
Be free of all the pain
You hold inside

You cannot hide
I know you tried
To feel...
