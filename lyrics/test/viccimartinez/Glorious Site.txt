Our hearts collide
We become one
From the moment you looked through my eyes

Time has stopped
There's no one around
The words my lips speak my seem profound

I've thrown away fear
I see a new light
My future now holds a glorious site

Forgive my faults
Open your heart
Embrace my love as a new start
Breathe me in
I'll breathe you in
Can you hear me calling out?
For your love, I scream out loud
Do you hear the yearning in my voice?

The road ahead is meaningless
Without the taste left from your kiss
Will you be my glorious site?

Please believe, I need you here
My sun only shines when you are near
And don't forget, the times we've shared
The moments when I thought you really cared
Breathe me in
I'll breathe you in

Can you hear me calling out?
For your love I scream out loud
Do you hear the yearning in my voice?
The road ahead in meaningless without the taste left from your kiss
Will you be my glorious site?
Please be my glorious site
Breathe me in
I'll breathe you in---
