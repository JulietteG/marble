Oh what the hell she says
I just cant win for losing
And she lays back down
Man theres so many times
I dont know what Im doin
Like I dont know now

By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Says its funny how the night
Can make you blind
I can just imagine
And I dont know what Im supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

And she says ooh
I cant take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cuz I cant help her now
Shes down in it
She tried her best and now she cant win its
Hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration
But it dont feel right

By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And theres something less about her
And I dont know what Im supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
And dont let her see

And she says ooh
I cant take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cuz I cant help her now
Shes down in it
She tried her best and now she cant win its
Hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She shuts out the night
Tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Shell be all right
Shell be all right
Just not tonight

And she says ooh
I cant take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cuz I cant help her now
Shes down in it
She tried her best and now she cant win its
Hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
