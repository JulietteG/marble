Let it go
Let it roll right off your shoulder
Dont you know?
The hardest part is over
Let it in
Let your clarity define you in the end
We will only just remember how it feels

[Chorus]:
All lives are made in these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Time folds away
But these small hours
These small hours
Still remain

Let it slide
Let your troubles fall behind you
Let it shine
Till you feel it all around you
And I dont mind
If its me you need to turn to
Well get by
Its the heart that really matters in the end

[Chorus]

All of my regret
Will wash away somehow
But I cannot forget
The way I feel right now

In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Yeah these twists and turns of fate

[End]:
Time falls away
Yeah but these small hours
These small hours
Still remain
Yeah, ah, ah
Oh they still remain
These little wonders
Oh, these twists and turns of fate
Time falls away
But these small hours
These little wonders
Still remain...---Lyrics submitted by Andrew Wilson.
