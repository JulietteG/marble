Even with the walls around me 
I always miss the place where I grew up
it made us tough
the simple love, and wealth, and families
suicides, the kids who died too young
It broke us up

I remember laughing when we caught up
asking if that was still a part of me
is it a part of me?
at night we used to drive until we couldn't. 
all that we wanted was some company
and it was comforting

I'll carry on into the world
into the world
Innocence is hard to stand by
even with the catholic girls we loved
when they gave it up
life goes on

I remember laughing when we caught up
asking if that was still a part of me
is it a part of me?
at night we used to drive until we couldn't
all that we wanted was some company
and it was comforting

visit with the Virden families
Step inside the house where I found love
I earned that cut
Lori Anne I know you're out there 
watching us continue to grow up
you cared too much
life goes on

I remember laughing when we caught up
asking if that was still a part of me
is it a part of me?
at night we used to drive until we couldn't. 
all that we wanted was some company
and it was comforting.

at night we used to drive until we couldn't
all that you wanted was some company---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
