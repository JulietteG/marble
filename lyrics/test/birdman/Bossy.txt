[Verse 1:]
Yeah sun shinin doin it like this-a-way
5 star doin it like everyday
Pick mama up ridin with the paper plates
Big houses 20 mills own estates
Brought her to my town
Showed her my uptown, showed her my uptown
Show her where i stood my ground
How we did it how we put it down
New money and we blowin straight out the pound
To the mall let her do what she do
She grind cause she wanna
And she hustlin too

About 8, 9 o clock mama cookin my shit

I love it when she bossy
Sexy when she bossy

When we switch roles I let it be known

Been through a whole bunch of yall solo
You know its all good like i give it up

Bring her to an island let her piece it out
Lovin my gangster tatted out
