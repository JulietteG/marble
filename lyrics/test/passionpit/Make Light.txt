So now we see
Comes burying my burnt remains
These puddled clouds
Oh I,      
 I understand now

But darkness falls likes shattered pieces
Dangling, shimmering
Torn and tattered and crowned
Oh I'll not be told "No" to:

"No More!"

You must believe to hear me sing these
Messy morsels of my self-assuring love
Oh it's painful kneading
Yes, I lie and I wrangle with prospective angles
That glare me down and face me with all I do wrong
Why do they all look like me?

So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh
Just to prove I'm alive
And it's alright
Cause tonight there's a way I'll make light
Of my treacherous life

If I had hands I'd hold up high
My lofty dreams and my alibi's real name
But I have no strength
So I toss and I turn and I spit in the urn
There's a ghost in your eye
There is someone that knows more than I
But I'm quick to deny

So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh
Just to prove I'm alive
And it's alright
Cause tonight there's a way I'll make light
Of my treacherous life

Make light!---Lyrics submitted by Lydia.
