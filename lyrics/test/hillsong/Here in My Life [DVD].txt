I have never walked on waters 
Felt the waves beneath my feet but 
At your word Lord I receive your
Faith to walk on oceans deep 

And i remember how you found me
In that very same place
All my failings surely would have drowned me
Still you made a way

Chorus:
You are my freedom
Jesus your the reason
Im kneeling again at your throne
Where would I be without you
Here in my life
Here in my life

You have said that all the heavens
Sings for joy at one who finds the
Way to freedom
Truth of Jesus
Bought from death into his life

And I remeber how you saw me
Through the eyes of your grace
And though the cost was
Your beloved for me
Still you made a way

Chorus:
You are my freedom 
Jesus your the reason 
Im kneeling again at your throne
Where would i be without you 
Here in my life
Here in my life

You are my freedom 
Jesus your the reson
Im kneeling again at your throne
Where would i be without 
Here in my life
Here in my life

You are my freedom
Jesus your the reason (*repeat)---Lyrics submitted by germaine.
