Falling on my knees in worship 
Giving all I am to seek your face 
Lord all I am is yours.
My whole life I place in your hands 
God of Mercy Humbled I bow down 
Tn your presence at your throne. 

I called
You answered
and you came to my rescue and
I wanna be where you are. 

My whole life I place in your hands
God of Mercy Humbled I bow down
In your presance at your throne. 

I called 
You answered
and you came to my rescue and 
I wanna be where you are.

I called 
You answered
and you came to my rescue and 
I wanna be where you are.

In my life be lifted high,
In our world be lifted high, 
In our love be lifted high. 

Higher and higher. 

In my life be lifted high,
In our world be lifted high, 
In our love be lifted high.

Yeah higher

In my life be lifted high,
In our world be lifted high, 
In our love be lifted high.

I called 
You answered 
and you came to my rescue and
 I wanna be where you are.---Lyrics submitted by Brittany.
