all creation cries to you
worshipping in spirit and in truth
glory to the faithful one
Jesus Christ God's son

all creation gives you praise
you alone are truly great
you alone are God who reigns
for eternity(yeah..)

God is great and his praise
fills the earth,fills the heavens
and your name will be praise 
through all the world...
God is great sing his praise
all the earth,all the heavens
'cause we're living for the glory
of your name
the glory of your name

all to you oh God we bring
Jesus teach us how to live
let your fire burn in us
that all may hear
and all may see

holy is the Lord 
the whole earth sings
the whole earth sings
holy is the Lord
the whole earth sings
the whole earth sings---Lyrics submitted by rodelo.
