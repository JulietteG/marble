[Verse 1:]
In the Father there is freedom
There is hope in the name that is Jesus
Lay Your life down, give it all now
We are found in the love of the Savior

[Verse 2:]
We are sold out to Your calling
Everything that we are for Your glory
Take our hearts now, have it all now
Let our lives shine the light like the morning

[Pre-Chorus:]
We've come alive in You
Set free to show the truth
Our lives will never be the same

[Chorus:]
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way

[Bridge:]
Roll back the curtains from our eyes
And now we can see You
Shown us your way, your truth and life
We offer our lives to bring You fame
We're caught in Your freedom
We're caught in Your freedom ---Lyrics submitted by xavier granja.
