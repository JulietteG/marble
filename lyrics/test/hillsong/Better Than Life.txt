Better than the riches of this world
Better than the sound of my friends voices
Better than  the biggest dreams in my heart
And that's just the star


Better than getting what I say I need
Better than living the life that I want to
Better than the love anyone could give
Your love is


You hold me now in your arms
and never let me go


You oh Lord make the sun shine and 
the moon light in the night sky
You give me breath and all your love
I give my heart to you because

I can't stop falling in love with you 
I'll never stop falling in love with you---Lyrics submitted by Ryan.
