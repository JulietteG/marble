I'm still learning what love is,
Every day I wake up in your arms.
I'm still trying to figure out what works,
How to set off all your alarms.

I'm still learning what love is,
When I'm walking close to you,
The best way to hold your hand in mine,
The best ways to comfort you.

Guess it may
Guess it may
Guess it may
Guess it may
It may always be this way.

I'm still learning what love is,
Every time you look at me that way.
I'm still trying to figure out just how,
You can still look at me the same.

Guess it may
Guess it may
Guess it may
Guess it may
It may always be this way.

Even though I may not get it right all the time,
I will always try and I will always stand right by your side.

I'm still learning what love is,
Every day I wake up in your arms.
I'm still trying to figure out what works.

Guess it may
Guess it may
Guess it may
Guess it may
Guess it may
Guess it may
It may always be this way.---Lyrics submitted by Jeanne.
