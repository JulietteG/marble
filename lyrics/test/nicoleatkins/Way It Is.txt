Don't tell me
My love's not the one that I want
That he's not the one that I need
I'd rather 
find out for myself

You're the one
Who shakes at the touch of my hand
but can't decide where he should stand
If I was smart
I'd never call you, call you
ever again

Oh, in my ears 
my blood is just roaring
when he's the only one I've ever wanted
I suppose that's just the way it is

Just think this could be
The last time I hold you, hold you
ever again

Oh, I don't think I'll ever sleep till
morning
Coz he's the only one I've ever wanted
Oh, and in my ears
my blood is just roaring
Coz he's the only one I've ever wanted
I suppose that's just the way it is---Lyrics submitted by mffairy.
