We cut
The look
Now it stings in
Blinding light

Now it melts
At last
And flow in
Daylight

Now drag and stretch oneself
And drag out the arm
Try to receive
And brake over falling places (?)
Running blood in the veins

On the skin
All over
Hitch claws in
And scratch in

Now drag and stretch oneself
And drag out the arm
Try to receive
And brake over falling places (?)
Raise by the abdomen
Spine
Running blood in the veins

Don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

Don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

Don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

Now drag and stretch oneself
And drag out the arm
Try to receive
And brake over falling places (?)
Raise by the abdomen
Spine
Running blood in the veins---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
