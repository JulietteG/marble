Close your eyes, baby.  Follow my heart
Call on the memories here in the dark
We'll let the magic take us away
Back to the feelings we shared when they played.

In the still of the night
Hold me darlin', hold me tight
Say....
So real, so right
Lost in the fifties tonight

These precious hours we know can't survive
But love's all that matters while the past is alive
Now and for always til time disappears
We'll hold each other whenever we hear

In the still of the night
hold me darlin', hold me tight
Say....
So real, so right
Lost in the fifties tonight.

Say....
So real, so right---Lyrics submitted by Cathy.
