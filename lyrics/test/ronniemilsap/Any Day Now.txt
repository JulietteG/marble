Any day now, I will hear you say
Good bye, my love 
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild, beautiful bird, you will have flown, whoa
Any day now, I'll be all alone, whoa-oa-oa

Any day now, when your restless eyes meets someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows will fall all over town, oh 
Any day now, (any day now)
Love will let me down, (any day now), oh, oh, oh

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay-ay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holdin' on for dear life

Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now, when the clock strikes go  
You'll call it off
Then my tears will flow
Then my wild, beautiful bird, you will have flown, oh
Any day now, (any day now) 
Love will let me down, (any day now)
Cause you won't be around

(Harmonica Instrumental)

Oh, then the blue shadows will fall all over town, oh
Any day now, (any day now)
Love will let me down, (any day now)
'Cause you won't be around

Any day now, you won't be around
Oooooh
(Any day now)
No, no, no, no, no, no 
You won't be around
(Any day now)
