Give up, give in
Cause you know you'll never become something
Just the same as ever
You wont fit in that's just how it goes
Breathe in, walk out,
Will anybody ever know

I know you find it hard to shine
When every turn you take is lined
With the fear of never making it alive

Woah-oah

Never give in, hope is all we have
And all weve ever known (woah-oah)
Never fear it, but you gotta hear me out (woah-oah)
So scream it out loud
And scream it out loud

We will be big
Always standing proud
We will sing up
We will shout it loud
We can be strong
When it all comes down
We wont move on
We will always stick around

I know you find it hard on times
When everyone you see is blind
To the hopes that you still dream about inside

Woah-oah

Never give in, hope is all we have
And all weve ever known (woah-oah)
Never fear it, but you gotta hear me out (woah-oah)
So scream it out loud

Never give in, hope is all we have
And all weve ever known (woah-oah)
Never fear it, but you gotta hear me 
And all weve ever known

Never give in, hope is all we have
And all weve ever known
Never fear it, but gotta hear me out
So scream it out loud---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Willis.
