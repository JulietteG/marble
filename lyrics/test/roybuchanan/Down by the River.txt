Be on my side, Ill be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
You know its so hard for me bein' here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

Ooh, la la la la la la la
She could drag me over the rainbow and take me away
Down by the river, I shot my baby
Down by the river, dead, yeah
You know I shot her dead

Well, you take my hand and Ill take your hand, baby
Oh, together we may get away
All of this madness is too much sorrow, yes it is
And its impossible to make it today

Ooh, la la la la la la la la la la
She could drag me over the rainbow and take me away
Down by the river I, Lord I shot my baby
Down by, down by the river, I shot my baby---Lyrics submitted by Dale Wickliffe.
