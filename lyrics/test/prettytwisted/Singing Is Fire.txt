The birds are on fire
And I walk across the room
Hold back the shade
And they are out there now

Burning at 5:05am
The darkness lifting
Like horses falling through sand
They are out there now

I got a base full of whiskey left
And enough stretchers to carry the dead now
But I cant save the burning birds

And they are telling me
They are telling me
Singing is fire
(Singing)Is flame
And they are telling me
Singing is fire
Singing is flame
Singing is

Old trains move through desert
And the whores sleep John Doe now
School boys dream of leaving this love
Or whatever it is you call it this time of night
And its 5:36am
And I still got a little whiskey left
Yes, I still go a little whiskey left
I still have a chance now

Its really nothing new
Feeling so bad they used to call it the blues
But whatever it is you call it this time of night
And I still got a little whiskey left
Yes, I still go a little whiskey left
So I still have a chance now
I still have a chance now
I still have a chance now

And Im singing is fire
(Singing) Oh, oh, oh
Singing is flame
Oh, oh, oh (Singing)
Singing is fire
(Singing) Oh, oh, oh
Singing is flame

I am singing
(Singing) Oh, oh, oh
(Singing) Is flame
And I am singing (Singing) is fire
Oh, oh, oh
Singing is flame
(Singing) Is fire
Singing (Singing) is flame
I am singing (Singing) is fire
Singing (Singing) is flame
We are singing is fire
Oh, oh, oh
Singing is flame---Lyrics submitted by Pita.
