At first I am afraid, but not because of fear. 
But the Holy of Holies is drawing me near.
You voice like thunder shakes the ground Im on.
Hide my face in the shadow of your wings, O Lord.
Hide my sin from the beauty here before your throne, your throne.

Chorus: 
Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain, (2x)
And so we enter into see your face, we enter into see your face Oh God.

Im falling to my knees, I feel the earth beneath with the weight of my sin. And this crushing unbelief could you really love me with all that Ive done.
(O Lord hide my face in the shadow of your winds O Lord
Hide my sin from the beauty here before your throne. 2x)

Chorus 2x

You spread your hands and made a refuge for the weak and blessed the weary bruised and broken. Took us in inside your wounds we hideaway inside your wounds we hide. 2x

Chorus 2x---Lyrics submitted by Jen.
