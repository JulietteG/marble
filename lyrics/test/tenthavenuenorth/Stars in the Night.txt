No matter where you lead, we want to follow You
Trouble is we forget who we belong to
We chase the wind and tides
We chase the reasons why
Chase the spark inside each others eyes
Desires are a war, we want that final shore
Sailing on until we find what weve been looking for

Hallelujah, were running to You
On fire from the mercy in Your eyes
And through the dark, singing we are Yours
Your love will lead us through the fight
Like stars in the night
Stars in the night
Stars in the night
Lead us through the fight

We fix our eyes on what we know is true
Even in our shame, grace makes a way through
Be our obsession, our constellation
You are light in and out of every season
So we keep pressing on with our redemption song
No one can undo what Youve done

All our lives for the other side, where well never die
And in the darkest night, we will lift our eyes
The life that lies ahead is more than all we leave behind

Stars in the night---
