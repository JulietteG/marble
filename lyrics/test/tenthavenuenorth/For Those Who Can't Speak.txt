(feat. Derek Minor and KB)

I see the glory of the Lord every time the sun rises
I hear the unheard screams of a broken heart
Because every day a son dies
27 million slaves but no plantation
27 million slaves, all different races
This is not the picture the Lord painted in Genesis
Silence is our enemy, our voices can end it

I have dreamed of a kingdom coming where
Evil drowns in mercy streams
I want to see those rivers of justice
So I use my voice for those who cant speak
I will use my voice for those who cant speak

Yeah, yeah, when its all said and done
Yeah, I pray that everything we said is done
I dont want my son to say I was one of the ones
That watched 27 million suffer and never say
No, no, I wont be that
I dont deserve a mic if I aint got no feedback
Bring back every girl from the west to the east that
He crafted for His glory, not for making you green backs
I dream that
Every ounce of brokenness and disease that
Bring that to the cross, believe that He redeems that
Sees that type of world that my daughters can breathe in
Where the beautiful feet that go where the needs at

Come on, come on

Oh, none of us here are just a number
We all have a name like any other
Theres breath inside your lungs
And you are my brother
My God, when will we stand
Stand together

I want to be the kingdom coming where
Evil drowns in mercy streams
Oh, let me see those rivers of justice
So I use my voice for those who cant speak
I will use my voice for those who cant speak
I use my voice for those who cant speak---
