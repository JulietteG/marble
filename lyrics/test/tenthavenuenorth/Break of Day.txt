I watch the color leave the sky
It already feels like midnight inside
From the minute it begins
'Til the light comes back again
I, I will
I will tell my heart
I will tell my soul
Just keep waiting for the morning
I will tell my heart
I will tell my soul

That if the demons come at night
And I can't feel You by my side
Even if I fall a thousand times
I'll keep calling Your name
Waiting for the break of day

The evening lets the monsters in
I can feel them creeping in
And they're whispering, you
You made this all up in your head
Why don't you just give up and give in
But I will tell my heart

That if the demons come at night
And I can't feel You by my side
Even if I fall a thousand times
I'll keep calling Your name
Waiting for the break of day

I am waiting
I'm still waiting on You
I'm crying out
But I will tell my heart
I will tell my soul
Theres light on the horizon
I will tell my heart
I will tell my soul
Yeah, mercy meets the morning
I will tell my heart
I will tell my soul
Yeah

That if the demons come at night
And I can't feel You by my side
Even if I fall a thousand times
I'll keep calling Your name
Waiting for the break of day---
