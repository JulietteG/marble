Feel the breathing in your lungs
Lift your face warm against the sun
And be not blinded by what you see
Cause in this moment, we touch eternity

We are coming aware
We are coming aware

You are closer, closer
You are closer, closer
Come on, closer than my fear
You are closer, closer
You are closer, closer
Come on, let me know Youre near
And push away my fear
Push away my fear

Where can I go, where can I hide
You know my every thought and everything inside
Youre attracted to the weak
My prides the only thing that keeps You from me

Well, Im embarrassed to admit
The distance Ive been feeling
Has all been self-imposed
So now its time to quit
And let Your nearness in
No fear will go unopposed

I can feel You in the air
I feel You now---
