I've had better days than this
Words trip like untied shoelaces
Still you're worth falling down for once in a while

And I'm disinclined to admit
With you and I this could be it
And something's telling me we'll know before too long

Are you really going out there on your own
These tangled lines all come undone
How did it feel when you let go
You try your luck in your best suit
Tied to a broken parachute
It's the hole in my heart you fell through

Tried reading tea leaves and the stars in all the days we were apart
Maybe my mind wasn't made up, but I chose love
Still I'm inclined to admit, with you and I this might be it
These failed predictions kept us wondering all the time

I never wanna let you down
So why not cut these strings before we hit the ground

And now you're out there on your own
These tangled lines all come undone
Tell me how it feels letting go
You try your luck in your best suit
Tied to a broken parachute
It's the hole in my heart you fell through

If you say I'm wrong I'll say you're wrong
But no one has to be right
And if you say you're wrong I'll say I'm wrong
Nothing could be worth this fight

We try our luck not our strong suit
We can't give up this parachute
Oh the hole in my heart you fell through---Lyrics submitted by Daizy.
