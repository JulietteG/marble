say its alright (its alright)
say its alright (its alright)
have a good time
cuz its alright
whoa its alright

we're gonna move it slow
when the lights are low
when you move it slow 
its sounds like more 
and its alright
whoa its alright

now listen to the beat
and kinda pat your feet
you've got soul
and everybody knows
that its alright
whoa its alright

when you wake up early in the morning
feeling sad like so many others do
have a little soul
make life your goal
and surely somethings gotta come to you

and say its alright
say its alright
say its alright
have a good time
cuz its alright
whoa its alright

everybody clap your hands
now give yourselves a chance
you've got soul
and everybody knows 
that its alright
whoa its alright

-bridge-

someday i'll find me a woman
who will love and treat me real nice
then my roads got to go
and my love she will know
from morning noon and night
and shes got to say its alright
say its alright
say its alright
have a good time 
cuz its alright
whoa its alright

everybody clap your hands
now give yourselves a chance
you've got soul
and everybody knows 
that its alright
whoa its alright---Lyrics submitted by ANGELA ALDATZ.
