Verse 1:
I'm puttin' on pearls, I'm puttin' on pumps, got a little lace apron on me
Gonna make you stop, gonna make you wanna watch me do the laundry
Gonna put some fun back in this ho-hum honey
Gonna be so hot you think it oughta cost you money
You aint gonna wanna leave home, 'cause I got it goin' on
I will be most anything you want

Chorus:
I'll be your laughter
I'll be your drama
I'll be your best friend
I'll be your lover
You can be my baby, anytime you wanna
But I aint your mamma, no I aint your mamma

Verse 2:
I won't make you rules, I won't wipe your nose, I aint gonna check up on ya
Stay out all night long as that sunlight gonna tellin' on ya
I won't be your boss
I won't be the bad cop, baby
But I'll be the one you just wanna love.like.crazy.
'Cause I'll do all those things that make ya wanna sing, I'll say your name, make ya wanna do the same

Chorus:
I'll be your laughter
I'll be your drama
I'll be your best friend
I'll be your lover
You can be my baby, anytime you wanna
But I aint your mamma, no I aint your mamma

Oh come on honey
You aint gonna wanna leave home, 'cause I got it goin' on
I will be most anything you want

Chorus:
I'll be your laughter
I'll be your drama
I'll be your best friend
I'll be your lover
You can be my baby, anytime you wanna
But I aint your mamma, no I aint your mamma
I'll be your best friend
I'll be your lover
You can be my baby, anytime you wanna
But I aint your mamma, no I aint your mamma---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
