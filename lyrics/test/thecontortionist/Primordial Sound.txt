Your primordial sound, echoing out
Existence grows from itself, echoing out

What you seek, the obsolete
The answers are of no use to you now
Echoing out

All within, is all we know
All you know versus all you don't

Existence grows from itself, echoing out

All that you know versus all that you don't

You don't know
You don't

Yeah

All within, is all we know
All you know versus all you don't---
