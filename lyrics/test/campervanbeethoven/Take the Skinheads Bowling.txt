Every day, I get up and pray to Jah
And he increases the number of clocks by exactly one
Everybodys comin home for lunch these days
Last night there were skinheads on my lawn

CHORUS:
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowlng
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling

Some people say that bowling alleys got big lanes (got big lanes, got big lanes)
Some people say that bowling alleys all look the same (look the same, look the same)
Theres not a line that goes here that rhymes with anything (anything, anything)
I has a dream last night, but I forget what it was (what it was, what it was)

REPEAT CHORUS

I had a dream last night about you, my friend
I had a dream, I wanted to sleep next to plastic
I had a dream, I wanted to lick your knees
I had a dream, it was about nothing

REPEAT CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Chris Gimbrone.
