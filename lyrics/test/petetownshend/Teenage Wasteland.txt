Out here in the fields, I fought for my meals
I gave my back here to my living
I don't need to fight, to prove I'm right.
I don't need to be forgiven.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Silently take my hand, we'll travel south cross land.
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder.
The exodus is here, the happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older.

Teenage wasteland. It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland. Oh yeah, teenage wasteland.
They're all wasted.---Lyrics submitted by Theresa Kwechin.
