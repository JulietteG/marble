Lucky at love, well, maybe so
There's still a lot of things you'll never know
Like why each time the sky begins to snow
You cry...

You're faithful to her in your careless way
So you miss her when she's far away
But every time you think you've got it straight
You fall...

You face the future with a weary past
Those dreams you banked upon are fading fast
You know you love her but it may not last
You fear...

It's never easy and it's never clear
Who's to navigate and who's to steer
So you find yourself drifting ever near
The rocks...

It's hard to say where love went wrong
It's hard to say just when
It's hard to walk away from love
It may never come again

You do your best to keep your hand in play
And try to keep those lonesome blues at bay
You think you're winning but it's hard to say
Sometimes...

It's hard to say where love went wrong
It's hard to say just when
It's hard to walk away from love
It may never come again

Luck at love, well, maybe so
There's still a lot of things you'll never know
Like each time the sky begins to snow
You cry...---Lyrics submitted by Jodine M Kamler.
