Like a child, and your mother's gone away
When's she comin' back, when's she comin' back again?
Beautiful child, and your garden's growin' wild now
Growin' wild flowers
I know whatever's been said
Fall down and sing you praise
Will you be my saving grace?

Black and blue, you cover up the bruises
Underneath your blouse, your colors are runnin' wild
You try to hide, sister mercy, Mister
I don't know how you hit her
Don't know how you hit her
I'd like to take her away
This could be my saving grace
This could be my saving......
Now, now, now, now

Bleedin' sacred heart, breaks and falls apart
Why is it always the way? She said...
Foolish heart, made of paper, made of cloth
Says that alot of love, is a promise just enough
Whatever's been said, now I sing you praise
Will you be my saving......
Now, now, now, now---Lyrics submitted by Tom Smith.
