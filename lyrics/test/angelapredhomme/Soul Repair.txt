Soul Repair               

Say that you love me
You know just what I crave
Coax me so subtly
In your own special way
Feel my touch linger
Even when youre away   
 Cause you got the single
Bait thats keeping me crazed

(Prechorus)
And when life hunts you down
I can help you rebound

(Chorus)
Glide, slide your way to my lovin
Ill fix you up with such care
Fly to my shelter for cover 
Where its just you and I
for some soul repair

(Verse 2)
When youre surrounded
People pushing your space
You feel confounded
At the end of the day
Tune out that chaos
Know my love doesnt sway
 (cause) I got your flavor
Like a midnight buffet
When your mojos run dry
You know I can provide

(Repeat chorus)

(Bridge) 
Here, Ill cradle you softly
All night youre got my ear
Let your arms fall across me
Tell me all of your fears

(repeat chorus)
