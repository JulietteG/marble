You Make Me Sing

(verse 1)
You, you make me sing about happy things and
You make my heart ring 
I feel just like a spoonful of joy, I twirl like a toy, 
Rushing with sunshine, lifting my voice
You just make me want to sing

(verse 2)
I, Im taken in . . I feel warm and toasty
I just love it when 
you got this way of     
Bringing me up, smoothing me out,
rounding my edges, trashing the rut
You just make me want to sing

(bridge)
I see you here beside me
Its better than before
You sail me straight to happy
With/theres so much more in store
I cant contain this stirring urge of singing  (doo)

(verse 3)
You, you make me sing like daydream-inspired
Blue fresh morning wind 
each whisper of you
floats round my mind, drifts out of time, 
bounces through heaven cause youre so divine
You just make me want to sing

(repeat bridge)
