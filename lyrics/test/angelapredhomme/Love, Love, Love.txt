Love, Love, Love                    

Na na na . . . 4x
Love, love, love . .Oh, love, love love
Love, love, love . .Oh, love, love love  

Each and every day, Im gonna  
Do the things that say

(chorus)
Lets love each other, find the best of us, through love 
Lets love each other, Love is only good, so good, oh, so good

(verse 2)
Na na na . . . 4x
Love, love, love . .Oh, love, love love
Love, love, love . .Oh, love, love love  

Ill take the higher road
Cause Im in growing mode

(repeat chorus)

(bridge)
Songs have already been sung
About imagining living in peace
Yet it rolls off my tongue
Because love it still all we could need

(repeat verse)
(repeat chorus)
