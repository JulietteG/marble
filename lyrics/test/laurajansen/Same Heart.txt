I spent a long time hiding
Believing that I was alone
Under the surface I was stone

When the walls that I built in the end 
Just knocked me down
I let the earth pull at my bones

Closing the distance
I'm reaching out
It starts with a whisper
Can you hear me now?
All the lies we spoke
And dreams we broke
Underneath it all
Beats the same heart
Beats the same, same heart
Beats the same heart

We spent such a long time trying
Rolling the rock up the hill
With just a trail of dust behind
Oh that city we built is a song
That calls us out
And we will sing it as we climb

Closing the distance
I'm reaching out
It starts with a whisper
But becomes a shout
All the lies we spoke
And dreams we broke
Underneath it all
Beats the same heart
Beats the same, same heart
Beats the same heart

Ooooh

Beats the same heart

Underneath it all
Beats the same heart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
