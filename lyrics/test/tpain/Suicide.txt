[Verse 1:]
The world keeps spinnin, with or without me
And I know, that's hard to believe
And now I'm in a box, with nothin around me
Cuz I found a girl that'll get on her knees (at ease)
And all the while I'm knowin that my homies will clown me
Cuz I fucked her and didn't have a rubber on me
It seems I had to find out the hard way
That the girl that I found in the ground, she had HIV
Now she next to me like

[Chorus:]
Lalala lala la lalala (suicide)
Lalala lala la lalala (suicide)
Lalala lala la lalala (suicide)

[Verse 2:]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 million ways, to leave this whole wide world so cold
Stuck on my ass I been drinkin for days
And I got the nerve to put that Bonneville on the road
Got that thang on me and a couple kilos
A bag of ecstasy and a pound of that dro (whoa)
But I guess I had to find out the hard way
Cuz I done came to the end of the road
Now I'm in the mirror like

[Chorus:]
Lalala lala la lalala (suicide)
Lalala lala la lalala (suicide)
Lalala lala la lalala (suicide)

Lalala lala la lalala
Lalala lala la lalala
Lalala lala la lalala---Lyrics submitted by Jocelyn.
