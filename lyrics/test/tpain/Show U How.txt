Ohhhh Weeeeee!!
Man I gotta thing for a girl that I don't even know.
Everybody in the hood say she's a hoe.
But I don't think so.I'ma try her anyway.
I could turn a hoe into a housewife any day.
It can even go the other way around.
That's because of the pimping from teddy penderazzdown
OK here comes the manipulation
I ain't trying to please her with my money precipitation.
Aviona watch and the Aviona (PIECE!)
Yellow bracelet and the king Johny (TEETH!)
I could be like hey miss lady
I gotta black and grey Mercedes
I gotta Cadillac car a Cadillac truck.
Man but I got the feeling she don really give a fuck
I wanna get to know her.
And if I give her the keys to my crib I'ma sit her down and show her she can.

[Hook:]
Lay down and let me lay with you.
If you stay around then I'ma stay with you.
Ain't no way I'm leaving girl let's talk about it.
Come here, I'ma show you how to love somebody.

She's a cool super duper down ass bitch
If she was a cup of liquor I would down that bitch like
Dun dun dun dun dun dun duuuun! Nappy boy queen. God damn I done crowned that bitch. BITCH!
2 weeks and we done fell into it. And ain't nobody have to tell her to do it.
I'm asking some questions about before me. I had to make sho I knew she wasn't a hoe.
She just looking for a nigga that can treat her like pain.
Take her to the movies, buy her brand new things.
But niggas treat her like OH! SKEET! SKRRRRRRRR!
Never heard of them ripping up her phone number, never heard a word from them[hello?]
But she ain't gotta worry 'bout them niggas.
Live life shawty you can do without them niggas.
But what can I say
Tell them kiss your ass 'cause at the end of the day you gotta place to

[Hook]
Lay down and I'ma lay with you.
If you stay around then I'ma stay with you
Ain't no way I'm leaving girl lets talk about it.

Don't listen to them they just jealous of you and me.
I care less about what you did, that ain't got nothing to do with me.
I'm in love, you are too, so let's do what we do.
And baby girl I'ma show you how to love somebody.
Don't listen to them they just jealous of you and me.
I care less about what you did, it ain't got nothing do with me.
I'm in love, you are too, so let's do what we do.
And baby girl I'm gonna show you how to love somebody.

[Hook]
