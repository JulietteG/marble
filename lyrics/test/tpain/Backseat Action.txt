[Intro:]
(Oh, oh)
I'm about to pull over, and give you the business holla at me
(Oh)
Can I get a witness?
Now here we go
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Now here we go
Mmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Baby, I've been waiting for you to come home
'cause I done cleared off the backseat, cleaned the top and out some new 24s on the ??
Lately I've been waiting to try something new
'cause we done did every last one of your fantasies
But we ain't did nothing I wanna do
'cause we done did in in the elevator (been there done that)
Now it's time to do it my way (I know you want that)
And pulling your hair, won't even compare to what I'm about to do to you on this highway

[Chorus - T-Pain:]
I'm talking about that backseat action (oh)
Out in the middle of the traffic (oh)
I'm about to pull over, and give you the business
Holla at me, (oh) can I get a witness?
Now here we go

[Hook - Shawnna (T-Pain):]
Here we go, back and forth, (mmmm) break it down, or take it slow (mmmm)
Take control, make it roll, (mmmm) break it down, now here we go (here we go)
Here we go, back and forth, (mmmm) break it down, or take it slow (mmmm)
Take control, make it roll, (mmmm) break it down, now here we go

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Shawty, you can call me whenever you need
Working in the Excursion, kissing in the Expedition like yes indeed
Baby, it's all gravy; it's all good
'cause we're gonna need to open up the back door and let your legs out
Or I'm gonna put you right on the hood
I've been down like an elevator (been there done that)
I know you like to do it my way (I know you want that)
And pulling your hair, won't even compare to what I'm about to do to you on this highway

[Chorus - T-Pain]

[Hook - Shawnna (T-Pain)]

[Verse 3: Shawnna]
Face down, ass up, that's the way I like it rough
Cloud it up, back it up, driver's seat to the passenger
Back to the back, all in the act
Smack, smack, smack, smack
Shining like that that good old kid
Hands on the window, foot on the wheel
Face in the seat, wait for the beat
Rocking and rocking making in squeak
Stop, stop, stop, stop
What you gonna do? Somebody might see
So make it fast, take it slow
Break it down and make it roll
Take control, make it swoll
Now one more time, here we go
