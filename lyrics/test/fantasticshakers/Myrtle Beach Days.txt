I was dreaming last night, 
when I got the notion, 
to pack my bags 
and head out for the ocean. 
And I was thinking to-day, 
of good times last year, 
of lookin' at the ladies, 
and drinking cold draft beers... 

Myrtle Beach Days! 
We'll have some fun 
in the waves, 
I don't care what the 
West Coast says, 
But I love those 
Myrtle Beach, 
love those 
Myrtle Beach Days! 

Come on down this summer 
It's gonna be a good year, 
of ridin' on the coaster, 
or fishin' off of the Pier, 
And I was thinking to-day, 
When I got the notion, 
to pack my cooler, 
and some suntan lotion... 

Myrtle Beach Days! 
We'll have some fun 
in the waves, 
I don't care what the 
West Coast says, 
Cause I love those 
Myrtle Beach, 
love those 
Myrtle Beach Days! 

[Music] 

Myrtle Beach Days! 
We'll have some fun 
in the waves, 
I don't care what the 
West Coast says, 
Cause I love those 
Myrtle Beach, 
love those 
Myrtle Beach Days! 

How I Love them 
Myrtle Beach Days! 
Of watchin' all the ladies 
And drinkin' some 
Ice cold draft beers 
I'm gonna catch me a big one! 
But I feel those days 
Myrtle Beach Days! 
Myrtle Beach Days! 
Oh oh oh oh...---
