In my left hand there is the familiar
In my right hand theres the great unknown
I can see the madly different gross there
But Im drawn to wilder nights at home

Dont listen to your friends
See the despair behind their eyes
Dont listen to your friends
They only care and want to know why

I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
Its pulling me back
Its pulling me
I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
Its pulling me back
Its pulling me

Are you drifting way beyond whats normal
'Cause 'round your mind rings the words that they would say?
When you go home everything looks different,
And you're scared of being left behind.

Just listen to your friends
Trusted that fair look in their eyes
Just listen to your friends
They only care and hope you're alright

I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
Its pulling me back
Its pulling me
I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
Its pulling me back
Its pulling me

(whoa oh oh oh
whoa oh oh oh oh)

I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
Its pulling me back
Its pulling me
I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
Its pulling me back
Its pulling me

I can feel the draw
I can feel its pulling me back
Its pulling me back
Its pulling me
I can feel the draw
I can feel it pulling me back
Its pulling me back
Its pulling me
I can feel the draw
I can feel its pulling me back
Its pulling me back
Its pulling me
I can feel the draw
The draw
The draw
The draw
The draw ---
