The weight of living [x4]

All that you desired, when you were a child
Was to be old, was to be old
Now that you are here, suddenly you fear
You've lost control (lost control)
Do you like the person you've become, or....

Under the weight of living
You're under the weight of living
Under the weight of living
You are under the weight of living
The weight of living, the weight of living

It all crept up on you, in the night it got you
And plagued your mind, it plagues your mind
Every day that passes, faster than the last did
And you'll be old soon, you'll be old
Do you like the person you've become, oh....

Under the weight of living
You're under the weight of living
Under the weight of living
You are under the weight of living
The weight of living, the weight of living

Oh, tell yourself this is how it's going to be
Oh, tell yourself this is how it's going to be, oh....

Under the weight of living
You're under the weight of living
Under the weight of living
You are under the weight of living
The weight of living, the weight of living
The weight of living, the weight of living---
