There's an albatross around your neck,
All the things you've said,
and the things you've done,
Can you carry it with no regrets,
Can you stand the person you've become,
Ooh there's a light [x2]

Your Albatross, let it go, let it go,
Your Albatross shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake
The heavy weight of living

Stepping forward out into the day
Shrugging off the dust and memory
Though it's soaring still above your head
It is out of sight and none shall see
Oooh there's a light [x2]

Your Albatross, let it go, let it go,
Your Albatross shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake
The heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake
The weight of Living

It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes [x4]

Your Albatross, let it go, let it go,
Your Albatross shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake
The heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake
The heavy weight of Living

The Weight of Living [x4]---
