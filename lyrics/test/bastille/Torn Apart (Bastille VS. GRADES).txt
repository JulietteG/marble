I could only be myself with you around 
Oh, with you around 
And now theres nothing left for me to think about 
Whoa, to think about. 

And it hurts like hell 
To be torn apart 
And it hurts like hell 
To be thrown around 

We were born to be together 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 
We were born to be together 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 

You stepped with a heavy tread, 
And left your mark 
Oh, oh, oh 
Your mark on me 

The space you used to fill its now this great black hole 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Youre out of sight but not out of my mind 

And it hurts like hell 
To be torn apart 
And it hurts like hell 
To be thrown around 

We were born to be together 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 
We were born to be together 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 

We were born to be together 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 
We were born to be together 
Torn apart 
Torn apart 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 

My yin and yang is killin me 
gotta get back, back to the synergy  
dont forget where I been but youre gonna remember 
when I shake my ass like a leaf of September.  

I dont mean to kill your vibe  
but if you got it, you get it,  
and Ive been getting this shit for a long time  

Happiness only brings heartache Im so beyond naughty,  
and if you dont like it then why do you want me  
I see ya, dont front if I tickle the strings on your heart.  

You play second fiddle to my instrumental  
your critical nature departs in the middle of all of my riddles  
youve given up trying and now you just tear me apart---
