I can't complain. I ran away
After my big mistake, I can't complain
It was work-related. I killed a man
I knew his sister

Now I make calls to the USA
I order parts eight hours a day
For German cars made in here Mexico
"A NAFTA triumph", that's what I'm told

I'm Invisible
And if I'm fast enough
If I'm quick enough
I'm invisible - even to myself

I tried California right afterwards
But the West Coast wouldn't take
My mind was stuck deep in Ontario
On the frozen edge of the lake

So further down. You couldn't get to me
I'd pay my price. Death to memory
I wish I could get it back. I wish I could get it back

I'm Invisible
And if I'm fast enough
And if I'm quick enough
And if I'm fast enough

I'm Invisible even to myself---Lyrics submitted by Suavec.
