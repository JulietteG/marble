I've been trying to pretend 
That death is my friend 
Oh, this life 
Yes, this life ain't for me now 

I've been lying to myself 
Not to nobody else 
Oh, this life 
Yes, this life ain't for me now 
No 

LIAR 
I'm telling the truth to y'all 
HIGHER 
Gonna give a little proof to y'all 
HIGHER 
I'm gonna jump in the fire 

Well I walked into black 
Said I weren't coming back 
Saw my angel in blue 
She tell me "This life ain't for you" 
Oh, this life 
Tell it to me - this life ain't for me now 

I woke up feeling new 
'Cause now I know this life is for you 
Yes, this life 
Oh, this life ain't for me now 
It's for you! 

LIAR 
I'm telling the truth to y'all 
HIGHER 
I'm gonna give a little proof to y'all 
I'm gonna jump into the fire!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
