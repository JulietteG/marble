Morning comes and you awake
and think of her with every move you make.
Nobody knows that but me.

And when you're turning out your light
you dream the day you're gonna hold her tight.
Nobody knows that but me.

I'm the one that you tell.
You say I understand you so well.
Well, I understand perfectly.

Cause you don't know that every day
I'm wishing I could steal your heart away.
Nobody knows that but me.

(Piano solo)

You worry she
might suspect
that you're not actually perfect.
You are so perfect to me.

And you don't know that in the end
I was hoping we were more than friends.
Nobody knows that.
Nobody knows that.
Nobody knows that but me.---
