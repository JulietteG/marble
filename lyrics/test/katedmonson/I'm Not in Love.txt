I'm not in love.
 I havent got the world on a string
 I dont believe in Paris or spring and I dont wait for rings
 despite my youth I havent got a head full of clouds I dont take cues from horoscope hounds and I dont look around.
 Hey baby u had my heart but yours isnt mine to have. 
Forever will we never be together
 and the dreams when ill dream of you 
 just cut me like a knife 
youll haunt me 
if I cant be your wife
 ill go through life
 wearing entirely sensible shoes never to fear slippers or boots
  cause Im not in love 
Ill never be.
instrumental 
pretty baby you had my heart but yours isnt mine to have
 forever will we never
 be together 
 and the dreams I now dream of you just cut me like a knife
  oh dont haunt me if i cant be your wife 
Ill go through life wearing entirely sensible shoes
 never to fear glass slippers or boots because im not in love ill never be---Lyrics submitted by Quinn Hagen.
