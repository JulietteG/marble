Lately I've seen fear surrender 
To a dear and dying art 
So lets hold these leaves as if their branches 
And find holes to breath into our hearts 

So baby put your arms around me 
Lets make love a lucky charm 
And if you see my fear surround me 
Will you be my one good arm 

So ill bring the gun if you bring the money 
To the starting line 
And out in the cold I'm broke down on one knee 
And make you mine 
Well build a house together 
And bring the whole thing down 
As well stand together 
On and on and on and on and on 

So baby would I get a second chance 
Even if I had to crawl 

You know I've only got this song and dance 
To speak to you at all 
We put feet and hands together 
Right against the wall 

So ill bring the gun if you bring the money 
To the starting line 
And out in the cold I'm broke down on one knee 
And make you mine 
Well build a house together 
And bring the whole thing down 
As well stand together 
On and on and on and on and on 

Youll be around me 
Were lost in the cold and left with the hopeless 
But I believe I believe 

And over and over well see it 
And over and over well fall 
And over and over well never have enough 
And over and over well see it 
And over and over well fall 
And over and over well never be enough 

So ill bring the gun if you bring the money 
To the starting line 
And out in the cold I'm broke down on one knee 
And make you mine 
Well build a house together 
And bring the whole thing down 
As well stand together 
On and on and on and on and on 

Youll be around me 
Were lost in the cold and left with the hopeless 
But I believe I believe 
Youll be around me 
Were lost in the cold and left with the hopeless 
But I believe I believe 
But I believe I believe 
But I believe I believe---
