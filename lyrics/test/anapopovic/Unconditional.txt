Do you remember the time
way back in the day
when you were just right for me
and I was enough for you
back when our love used to be
Unconditional
When no questions were asked
no reasons to doubt
but an absolute truth

back when love used to be
Unconditional
With no intention to change
the initial thrill
spend hours to inhale
the irresistible you
back when love used to be
Unconditional
Yeah, back when love used to be
Unconditional---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
