This is my testimony everybody
How God favored me in spite of my enemies
And if God did it for me He'll do the Same thing for you.
Don't worry about your haters your haters
Can't do nothing with you
 Listen to these words

[Verse 1:]
Love is patient, caring.
Love is Kind.
Love is felt most when It's genuine, 
but I've had my share of love abused, manipulated
And it's strength misused, and I can't help but give you glory
When I think about my story, and I know you favored me
Because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me
Yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me.

I'm still here, I'm still alive, I'm still blessed, on my way to
My destiny, because the favor of God is on my life. 
Let me tell you about love.

[Verse 2:]
Love is patient, caring. Love is Kind. Love is felt most when
It's genuine, but I've had my share of love abused, manipulated
And it's strength misused, and I can't help but give you glory,
When I think about my story, and I know you favored me
Because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me
Yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me.

[Verse 3:]
They whispered, conspired, they told their lies (God favors me)
My character, my integrity, my faith in God (He favors me)
Will not fall, will not bend, won't compromise (God favors me)
I speak life and prosperity and I speak health (God favors me)
[x2]

Say Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes) God favors me
Say Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Say Yes (Yes) God favors me (God favors me)
[x2]---
