Nothing's left here but the sun
The human race is on the run
The ancient gods should have told
The earth has never felt this old

Countdown has begun
Apocalypse has got a son

Angels
Flying over the land of blood
Angels
Warriors that Heaven forgot

Read my bloodstained apoca-lips
21st century son of a bitch
Speaking with the mouth of a whore
Riding with the horsemen of four

Countdown has begun
Apocalypse has got a son

Angels
Flying over the land of blood
Angels
Warriors that Heaven forgot
Angels
Didn't come here for you and me
Angels
Why did you leave us her in misery---Lyrics submitted by Robbie.
