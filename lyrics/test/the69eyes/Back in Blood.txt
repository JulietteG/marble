2000 years city of hel 

Back in blood

Ive been so lonely lonely with out you
2000 years feel nothing but blue wake me take me
let me put my spell on you  moonlights turn over 
waiting is through

like romeo and juliet
will im feeling 

back in blood blacks the new black
back in blood blacks the new black

you keep me waiting waiting here for you 
2000 years baby what you gunna do 
wake me take me let me share this curse with you
moonlights turn over is through

like romeo and juliet
will im feeling 

back in blood blacks the new black
back in blood blacks the new black*4

Let me put my spell on you
im having the time of my life
let me share this curse with you

back in blood 
back in blood 
back in blood
back in blood

back in blood is the new black 
back in blood is the new black*4

back*6---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
