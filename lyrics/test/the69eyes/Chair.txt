Just walk
Away from these dreams
And talk
The pain what it seems
Angel of my revelation
I don't really wanna let you
Walk
Away from these dreams

You gotta turn it all over
You gotta turn it all over
All over again

Kick the chair right down under me
Leave me hanging alone in misery
Kick the chair right down under me
Leave me hanging alone in misery

Just walk
Away from these dreams
And talk
The pain what it means
Angel of my revelation
I don't really want to hurt you
So walk
Away from these dreams

You gotta turn it all over
You gotta turn it all over
All over again

Kick the chair right down under me
Leave me hanging alone in misery
Kick the chair right down under me
Leave me hanging alone in misery

Misery has gone ---Lyrics submitted by irakli.
