(Oooh) tell me what you think you're lookin at,
(Noo) so I think i'm Queen Elizabeth,
(Oooh) and now i'm stuck inside you're memory,
(So) that's why it's so hard to get rid of me,
i'm incredible, so unforgettable, So no one can take my place, 
I'm unbreakable, highly flammable, So girl get out my face,
Oh my god I'm going crazy Maybe cuz were so amazing 
Everbody in there dazin' That's the reason why they're hatin'
Treat us like some superstars and only cuz that's what we are 
You know we're going really far and ya'll ain't even heard it all

You hate cuz i'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem, uh-huh
Your hate cuz i'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem, uh-huh
You hate me cuz im everything that you ever wanted to be
And that i'm lying cuz i love it when you lookin at me
Cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
I said that i'm a rockstar, a rockstar
(Keep lookin at me)

(WOW) It seems to me like i was botherin'
(How) Cuz i make walkin look like modelin
(How) it ain't my fault the boys keep followin'
(Wow) if you were better he wouldn't be wonderin'
I'm inredible, so unforgettable, So no one can take my place,
I'm unbreakable, highly flammable, So girl get out my face,
Oh my god i'm going crazy Maybe cuz were so amazing 
Everybody in there dazin' That's the reason why they're hatin'
Treat us like some superstars and only cuz thats what we are 
You know we're going really far and ya'll ain't even heard it all

We're Prima J you know it
We're not afraid to show it
We hold our crown and that's right 
It can't stop us now
The cloud we're on is golden
They can't fix what's not broken
Don't act like ya'll don't know it

A pretty little problem, uh-huh
You hate me cuz im everything that you ever wanted to be 
And that i'm lying cuz i love it when you lookin at me
Cuz i'm a rockstar, a rockstar
I said that i'm a rockstar, a rockstar
