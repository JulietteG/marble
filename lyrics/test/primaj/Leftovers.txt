You want him that bad, then girl you can have him
You want him that bad, then girl you can have him
Say you want him that bad, then girl you have him
I ain't even trippin cause I already had him

You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers

[Verse 1]
I don't know if you know, but it's like this
I was his everything, you a side dish
Hung around like a stain on the carpet
You won his heart but I already got it
You thought it was a secret but I knew it all along (ay)
You were just an appetizer when I wasn't home (ay)
You come down with the games, time to get crunk (ay)
You were undercover 'til your cover got blown

[Pre-chorus]
So ima wash my hands from you (youuuu)
And you can do the things you do (doooo)
She can have you if she wants to...

[Chorus]
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers (Oh, Oh)
Since I'm done wit him girl you can come get him
He done got stale now, what I want wit him?
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers

(Woo)

[Verse 2]
He used to be my entre, 5 star dish
Now I did ya just heavy on my stomach
Thinkin back I wouldn't mind if I was starving
Now I had enough, so you in the garbage
I don't want watcha got cookin no more (ay)
You done expired, can't have it no more (ay)
And if I can't have it, wha whatcha here for (ay)
You look cross at a girl, gotta break farrr

[Pre-chorus]
So ima wash my hands from you (youuuu)
And you can do the things you do (doooo)
She can have you if she wants to:

[Chorus]
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers (Yea)
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers
Since I'm done wit him girl you can come get him
He done got stale now, what I want wit him?
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers
(Yea)
(ay, ay)
You can have him girl, You can have him girl
(ay, ay)
If you want him girl, If you want it girl

All them games just keep getting old by the hour
It's time to let it go cause this love got sour
I'm so done, movin' on to the next
I got what I needed, you can take what's left

[Chorus]
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers (oooooo)
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers
(You can take him you want him, take him if you want him)
Since I'm done wit him girl you can come get him (come get him)
He done got stale now, what I want wit him? (Yea)
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers (go on, go on:go on, go on)

You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers
You can have my leftovers, my leftovers, my leftovers
Oooo, oooo, oooo, Yea---Lyrics submitted by Kathy.
