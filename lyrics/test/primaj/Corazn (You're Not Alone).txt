don't worry your not alone
baby those days are gone
i promise you it'll get better,better
corazon a corazon

sometimes i just don't get it
and i don't know why
your heart all up in it
and it still don't fly

sometimes  you feelin' so low n you gotta maintain 
9 out of 10 and then run the same game
girl i know

don't worry your not alone
baby those days are gone
i promise you it'll get betta, betta
corazon a corazon..(2x)

he acts like your man but he got girls on the side
pain makes you hot but the truth don't lie 
girl i know 
yeah i know 

don't run away keep it real with yourself 
do it for you not for nobody else
girl i know [i know,i know]
yeah i know

don't worry your not alone
baby those days are gone
i promise you it'll get betta, betta
corazon a corazon

don't worry your not alone 
baby those days are gone[bye bye]
i promise you it'll get betta betta
