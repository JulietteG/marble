(Oooh) tell me what you think you're lookin at,
(Soo) so I think I'm Queen Elizabeth,
(Now) and now I'm stuck inside your memory,
(Soo) that's why it's so hard to get rid of me

I'm incredible, so unforgettable,
So no one can take my place
I'm unbreakable, highly flammable,
So girl get out my face

Oh my god I'm going crazy
Maybe 'cuz were so amazing
Everybody in there dazin'
That's the reason why they're hatin',
Treat us like some superstars
And only cuz that's what we are
You know we're going really far
And ya'll ain't even heard it all

You hate cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem, uh-huh,
You hate cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem, uh-huh,
You hate me cuz I'm everything that you ever wanted to be
And that I'm lying cuz I love it when you lookin at me
Cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
I said that I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
(Keep lookin at me)

(Wow) It seems to me like I was botherin'
(How) cuz I make walkin look like modelin
(How) it ain't my fault the boys keep followin'
(wow) if you were better he wouldn't be wonderin'

I'm incredible, so unforgettable,
So no one can take my place,
I'm unbreakable, highly flammable,
So girl get out my face

Oh my god I'm going crazy
Maybe 'cuz I'm so amazing
Everybody in there dazin'
That's the reason why they're hatin'
Treat us like some superstars
And only cuz that's what we are
You know we're going really far
And ya'll ain't even heard it all

You hate cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem, uh-huh,
You hate cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem, uh-huh
You hate me cuz I'm everything that you ever wanted to be
And that I'm lying cuz I love it when you lookin at me
Cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
I said that I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
(Keep lookin at me)

(Ladies) we're Prima J you know it
We're not afraid to show it
We hold our crown and that's right
It can't stop us now
The cloud we're on is golden
They can't fix what's not broken
Don't act like ya'll don't know
What's bout to happen now

You hate cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem uh-huh,
You hate cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem uh-huh
You hate me cuz I'm everything that you ever wanted to be
And that I'm lying cuz I love it when you lookin at me
Cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
I said that I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
You hate cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem uh-huh,
You hate cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
A pretty little problem uh-huh
You hate me cuz I'm everything that you ever wanted to be
And that I'm lying cuz I love it when you lookin at me
Cuz I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
I said that I'm a rockstar, a rockstar,
(Keep lookin at me)
