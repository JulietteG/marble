Hero
Villain
Even at my best I'm still my greatest enemy
Good intentions
Never saved a soul
They never changed reality
You had to die for me
Cause I'm only you mend me
Tried so hard and still get lost
Give our all, but nothing's complete
We need your love so strong
And I'm so flawed that you know I'm gonna fall
And you catch me
Your mercy
Your grace
My faith gives me strength to feel perfectly safe
Cause you'll catch me

Uninvited
Locked away from paradise a heart of golden dreams
Traded places
The walking in your steps creates the only hope for me
And you handed me the keys
Cause I'm only you mend me
Tried so hard and still get lost
Give our all, but nothing's complete
Cause we need your love so strong
And I'm so flawed that you know I'm gonna fall
And you catch me
Your mercy
Your grace
My faith gives me strength to feel perfectly safe
Cause you'll catch me

All of the time I couldn't do, I couldn't see, I couldn't read
You made me more than enough
And though I lose my step
I'm nothing less than yours
There's one thing I know
You'll catch me

We need your love so strong
And I'm so flawed that you know I'm gonna fall
And you catch me
Your mercy
Your grace
My faith gives me strength to feel perfectly safe
Cause you'll catch me X6---Lyrics submitted by Nekita Sharae.
