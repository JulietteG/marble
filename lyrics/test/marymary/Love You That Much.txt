Chorus: If you tell me to go, I'm gonna tell you I will
Cause I love you that much
If you tell me to stay and be still, I will
Cause I love you that much
Tell me what to say even if I'm afraid, I will
Cause I love you that much
It doesn't matter, whatever whenever I will
Cause I love you that much

Tina: Nowadays, everybody wants to be in control 
trying to be a leader when they've never really followed
got no information, I know direction and way too much pride
When men ain't that hard if you just ask the Lord to be your guide

Chorus

Erica: One love and one heart
One God who gives it away
Most folks, they don't wanna believe that today
But I'll take your love and I'll give my love all to you completely
Cause I trust in you and I believe that you will know what's best for me, yeah

Chorus

Bridge: I will always trust in the fact that you got me in the palm of your hand
Use me how you will, no matter how I feel
Cause there's no way that I can know you put the sun in the sky
and I can know you hung the moon for that night 
Still I wanna trust you or it wouldn't be right
So I'm sayin'
