I was now on the road and face someone new
Shape was her friend
And the color was few
We were down on the town /
Climbing into the with the begin
Go back down
Dont touch the ground
Go back down
Dont touch the ground
Go back down
Dont touch the ground
Go back down
Dont touch the ground
I was down on the road and I fix 
Took a .with a supply
You can never go home
never show
Sparks with remember above ..
Go back down
Dont touch the ground
Go back down
Dont touch the ground
Go back down
Dont touch the ground
Go back down
Dont touch the ground ---
