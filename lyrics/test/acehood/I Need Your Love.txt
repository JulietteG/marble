I need your love, need your love 
See me at the mall chillin with a lady 
So fine she my hey baby 
I need your love, need you love 
Just right my type what I like 
Youre dressed that nice and we kick it tonight 
Just tryna get right for the end of the night 
Shots of lean just to clear my mind 
Baby Im a sance, tell me what youre sign 
From the bottom to the top, girl youre just my kind 
I need your love, need your love 
Got my mind so blown blaze so what? 
Showin up, wait til we hold up 

Her love, I didnt know I really need that 
Cant live without it, I need rehab 
From the pretty lipstick, thinking how to waste it 
So fit but her ass need a D cal 
Main weather with the stake at the beat down 
Throw it back, Imma snatch you like a rebound 
Whats that? Yea shorty like a grayhound 
What up, do it there mama from the D town 
Girl I need your love its like fresh air 
Kick it with a young prince like Bel Air 
Its as strong but you never do a farewell 
They steal but they never keep in touch still 
See you bad as hell and they know it 
Fresh up out of the shower with that lotion 
Bend it over, you might cause a commotion 
Reminiscin how Im swimming in your ocean 
Go ahead lil mama cut the slack up 
On them with he fly red bottoms 
Me and you make sense, get them other boys pissed 
Cuz they already gatto 
Cuz I need that love 
Swear its something like a drug 
Come fucks with a thug 
From the bed to the top 

I need your love, need your love 
See me at the mall chillin with a lady 
So fine she my hey baby 
I need your love, need you love 
Just right my type what I like 
Youre dressed that nice and we kick it tonight 
Just tryna get right for the end of the night 
Shots of lean just to clear my mind 
Baby Im a sance, tell me what youre sign 
From the bottom to the top, girl youre just my kind 
I need your love, need your love 
Got my mind so blown blaze so what? 
Showin up, wait til we hold up 

Thats right shorty welcome to the good life 
We can do dinner time if the mood right 
Underwater with the stars and the mood right 
I deserve that love to the wife type 
Masons, Im a boss and you need that 
Upgraded, hand bastard, we burkin 
Credit cards going hard up in emans 
I cant wind B, I really mean that 
Thats my sense of humor eh 
See Im really like tryna pursue your boy 
I know your last boyfriend was a loser eh 
I aint lying if its way more cooler 
Im a fly young man 
Take you anywhere you wanna, Im the guy that can 
Hopin for the chance 
I can give you my time for your love in advance 
And its all at demand 
So shorty what you sayin? 
Money aint the same 
Leo mama you can trip to the land 
We aint even got a plan 
Put your feet in the sand 
And its back to the suite, go sleep in the bag 
Sweet freak in the sheets 
Im a beast with the gee so D 

I need your love, need your love 
See me at the mall chillin with a lady 
So fine she my hey baby

Aint that the reason why you love me baby? 

Girl you killin them hoes (I know it) 
Once your worldwide (wait for it) 
See I already know that I keep that shit on hanna 
Fuckin with my shades on, call me Stevie Wonder 
Put it so deep, she can feel it in her stomach 
Bitch so good, I can tell her when she run it 
Eyes rolled back, I can tell it when youre coming 
Song aint me, I can tell that she love 

Just tryna get right for the end of the night 
Shots of lean just to clear my mind 
Baby Im a sance, tell me what youre sign 
From the bottom to the top, girl youre just my kind 
I need your love, need your love

I need your love, need your love 
I need your love, need your love---Lyrics submitted by melanie.
