I'm in love with your brother
What's his name?
I thought I'd come by
to see him again
when you two dance
oh what a dance
when you two laughed
oh what a laugh

Does he mention my age, love?
or is he more into young girls with dyed black hair

I'm in love with your brother
I'd thought I'd come by

I'm in love with your brother
Yes I am
But maybe I
shouldn't ask for his name
and you dance
oh what a dance
And you laughed
oh what a laugh

Does he know what I do and
you'll pass this on, won't you and?
If I asked him once what would he say
Is he willing,
can he play?

He wasn't really looking for some more than
some company on the dancefloor and
Does he know what I do and
you'll pass this on, won't you and?

Does he know what I do and,
you'll pass this on, won't you?
And if I ask him once,
what would he say?
is he willing, can he play? ---Lyrics submitted by horacio matos.
