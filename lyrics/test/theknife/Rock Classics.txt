I'm coming over but I won't be long
I'm coming over
I'm making a new song

I pick a car and it's a fifteen minutes drive
Rock Classics on the radio
to clear my mind

Sometimes in the weekends
we meet up at our favourite cafe
I'll order a chai tea and you will have the usual au lait
and when the place get crowded
then they freak out
and they play the techno louder
yes, when the place get crowded
then they freak out
and they play the techno louder

Here comes another day in isolation
hold out your hand
feel my brain burns
you stuck and lick but you still don't know why
I could fuck your brains out
but I'm not interested in that life

Sometimes in the weekends
we meet up at our favourite cafe
I'll order a chai tea and you will have the usual au lait
and when the place get crowded
then they freak out
and they play the techno louder
yes, when the place get crowded
then they freak out
and they play the techno louder

I'm coming over but I won't be long
I'm coming over
I'm making a new song---Lyrics submitted by Ema.
