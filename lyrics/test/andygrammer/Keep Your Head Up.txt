Whoa, eh.
Whoa.

Ive been waiting on the sunset,
Bills on my mindset,
I cant deny that
They're getting high,
Higher than my income,
Incomes breadcrumbs,
Ive been trying to survive.

The glow that the sun gets,
Right around sunset,
Helps me realize,
This is just a journey,
Drop your worries,
You are going to turn out fine.
Oh, youll turn out fine.
Fine, oh, youll turn out fine.

But, you got to keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh,
Got to keep your head up, oh, 
And you can let your hair down, eh.
I know its hard,
Know its hard,
To remember sometimes,
But you got to keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh,eh,eh,eh.

I got my hands in my pockets,
Kicking these rocks,
Its kind of hard to watch this life go by.
Im buying into skeptics.
Skeptics mess with
The confidence in my eyes.

Im seeing all the angles,
Starts to get tangled,
I start to compromise.
My life and my purpose
Is it all worth it?
Am I going to turn out fine?
Oh, youll turn out fine.
Fine, oh, youll turn out fine.

But you got to keep your head up, oh, 
And you can let your hair down, eh,
Got to keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.
I know its hard,
Know its hard,
To remember sometimes,
But you got to keep your head up, oh,
And you cant let your hair down, eh,eh,eh,eh.

Only rainbows,
After rain.
The sun will always,
Come again,
Its a circle
Circling,
Around again,
It comes around again.

I said, only rainbows,
After rain,
The sun will always
Come again,
Its a circle
Circling,
Around again,
It comes around.

But you got to keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh
Got to keep your head up oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh,
I know its hard,
Know its hard,
To remember sometimes,
But you got to keep your  head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.

Keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh
Keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh
Keep your head up, oh,
And you can let your hair down, eh.
