I got my start on the street with the monkey next to me,
He'll shake your hand for a dollor 
If your nice kiss your cheek
To my left I could see Chinese flipping bowls
from their head to their feet

Yo

Strolling on the scene are my arch-enemies
break-dancers take your crowd,
your girl, your money
Balloon man telling me to turn down please
and the psychic agrees
I begin to see that

[Chorus]

Oh I'm home, I'm right where I belong
and there's no where else I'd rather be.
Cause those moments on the street
when the crowd would rock with me
I felt like the Biggest Man,
The Biggest Man in Los Angeles...
All I really need are some ears
to hear me dream I felt like
the Biggest Man,
The Biggest Man in Los Angeles
Standing on the street,
Just standing on the street


A trombone cuts deep
through the crowd
doing Motown moves 
with his hat tucked down,
A belly dancer passes around
the tip jar around
and the man are confused,
slightly aroused

Muslims, Christians preaching,
wishing I would shut up
so the people could listen
I'm supposed to cut through 
all this noise with my little voice,
I begin the see that..


[Chorus]

And the day goes dark,
I pack my car,
stare out at the ocean,
Take some time,
A quiet smile,
Let it all just soak in...


Cause those moments on the street
when the crowd would rock with me
I felt like the Biggest Man,
The Biggest Man in Los Angeles
'Cause all I really need for my life to be complete,
Are some ears to hear me dream,
Some ears to hear me dream

Yeah, those moments on the street
when the crowd would rock with me
I felt like the Biggest Man,
The Biggest Man in Los Angeles
All I really need are some ears to hear me dream
I felt like the Biggest Man,
The Biggest Man in Los Angeles

Standing on the street,
        Yeah,
Just standing on the street
Just standing on the street
Just standing on the street---Lyrics submitted by Savannah Golden.
