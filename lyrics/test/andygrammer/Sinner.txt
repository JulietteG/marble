Ive been throwing stones
Waiting by the river
Ive been on my own praying like a sinner
Youve been gone too long
Im waiting out the winter
Ive been on my knees
Praying like
Praying like a sinner

Well you built this city right in me
And brick by brick and piece by piece
And love in both in your hands tried to make an honest man
From when I woke until I went to sleep
You planned my life so carefully, sculpted me like clay
I could see you in my face
And I never thought Id live this life without your guiding light

Ive been throwing stones
Waiting by the river
Ive been on my own praying like a sinner
Youve been gone too long
Im waiting out the winter
And Ive been on my knees
Praying like
Praying like a sinner

And I heard the walls are paper thin from where you are to where I am
But I dont feel a thing, if you all keep pulling strings
Send on down a message please
Light a bull behind my dreams
Id just like to know that you hear me, that your close
And I never thought that Id live this life without your guiding light

Ive been throwing stones
Waiting by the river
Ive been on my own praying like a sinner
And Youve been gone too long
Im waiting out the winter
And Ive been on my knee
Praying like
Praying like a sinner
Youve been gone for too long
Oh ooo whoa
Youve been gone for too long
Oh ooo whoa

Ive been throwing stones
Waiting by the river
Ive been on my own praying like a sinner
Youve been gone too long
Im waiting out the winter
Ive been on my knees
Praying like

Ive been throwing stones
Waiting for the river
Ive been on my own praying like a sinner
Youve been gone too long
Im waiting out the winter
And Ive been on my knee
Praying like
Praying like a sinner
Praying like a sinner

Ive been throwing stones
Waiting for the river
Ive been on my own praying like a sinner
Youve been gone too long
Im waiting out the winter
And Ive been on my knee
Praying like
Praying like a sinner---
