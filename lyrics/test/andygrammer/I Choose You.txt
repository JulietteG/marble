When we're born into this world,
We don't really get a say
Little boys and little girls,
Handed their brand new families
There comes a time in life, 
When we finally get to choose
And I choose you, 
I choose you

We can't give our two cents,
On how tall we wanna be
We don't get an opinion,
On our ethnicity
But the one we get to spend our life with,
That we get to choose
And I choose you, 
I choose you

I choose you,
To be by my side
I choose you, 
To hold me at night 
It's the biggest decision,
I'm about to get right
Ad I choose you, 
I choose you

Everybody has one,
A choice they get to make
Half human half Heaven,
That decides the family tree
We all pick the branches,
That then become the roots
And I choose you,
I choose you

I choose you,
To be by my side
I choose you,
To hold me at night
It's the biggest decision,
I'm about to get right
And I choose you,
I choose you

And I was worried,
I would not know what to, do if I was in these shoes
But standing here it's clearer than the sky is blue
And I choose you,
I choose you

With so little we control,
Thank God it's in the rules
That we get to choose,
And I choose you

I choose you,
To be by my side
It's the biggest decision,
I'm about to get right
And I choose you,
I choose you---Lyrics submitted by Austin Buckley.
