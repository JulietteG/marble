Sometimes you need a reason
A bit of a love you can believe in
A little hug, a little big dreamin
Apparently theres some correlation between
Hearts and outer space
And all Im really trying to say is

That Im just a Sagittarius
And were kind of spontaneous
So lets head out to vegas and find an elvis to marry us
Dont try to argue with the moon

We can blame it on the stars
So cmon let your heart just breathe
Stars, oh cmon let your guard down
And we can blame it on the stars
(woo)

We like to think that well weigh in
On a previous reservation
Its all written in the constellations
Now I dont know, but either do you
Truth is, its a good excuse
For both our hearts to let loose

And I know that youre a cancer
Which means you like holding hands
So show me how to do this dance
And spin me like a ceiling fan oh
Dont try to argue with the moon

We can blame it on the stars
So cmon let your heart, just breathe
Stars, oh cmon let your guard down
And we can blame it on the stars

I read your horoscope
And baby you should know
Just what your future holds
Let your hands move
Let my fingers find you
Wrap my arms around you
Here we go

The stars,
Oh cmon let your heart just breathe
The stars, The stars, the stars

We can blame it on the stars
So cmon let your heart, just breathe
Stars, oh cmon let your guard down
And we can blame it on the stars

(woo)
We can blame it on the stars
(woo)
We can blame it on the stars---
