I lost perspective of who I was I hit the wall
I knew that it would take a lot but it took it all
No you dont come this far just turn around covered too many miles
No you dont get this close to breaking now, just to close your eyes

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
Im chasing myself in the sky
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
Ill be up here learning to fly
When you know what youre killing for
When you already know
Its sure to hurt but it worth every burn
Cuz one day youll be home
Till it feels like I, I am always on the red eye

This time around its not even about getting paid
Im just an addict for the moment when the magic is made
But when you are who you really are it can put you through hell
Just spend a day in the skin that you want to live in to see how it feels
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
Im chasing myself in the sky

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
Ill be up here learning to fly
When you know what youre killing for
When you already know
Its sure to hurt but it worth every burn
Cuz one day youll be home
Till it feels like I, I am always on the red eye

It feels like I, I am always on the red eye
Finding myself these days looking down from the window saying
Im counting lines on how just when I should just be counting sheep
Through days when I cant complain, do it over and over again
And over again

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
Im chasing myself in the sky
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
Ill be up here learning to fly
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
Im chasing myself in the sky
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
Ill be up here learning to fly
When you already know
Its sure to hurt but it worth every burn
Cuz one day youll be home
Till it feels like I, I am always on the red eye
It feels like I, I am always on the red eye---
