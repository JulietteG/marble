I know you didnt think loving me meant so much time alone
Dinner for one on the couch another movie on your own
You know that I am never going to be, a nine to five, that was never me
I was born with a compass in my head and a restless soul
But when it hurts, when you cant take it
And when the rubber band, feels like its breaking

Then hear the kick drum thats my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
And my vocal tickle your ear
And you almost can feel me here
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight

As far as ladies go, baby you should know youre so patient
Youre a thick skinned definition of low maintenance
But if enough time goes by, you cant help but dim your light
An empty house can make a cold heart feel so naked
But when it hurts when you cant take
And when the rubber band, feels like its breaking

Then hear the kick drum thats my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
And my vocals tickle your ear
And you almost can feel me here
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight

Yeah, let the the piano be your second home
For a while
And hold onto every note, and baby listen to close
For me inside

And hear the kick drum thats my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow

And hear the kick drum thats my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
And my vocal tickle your ear
And you almost can feel me here
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight

Will kiss you slow tonight
Will kiss you slow tonight
Will kiss your slow tonight---
