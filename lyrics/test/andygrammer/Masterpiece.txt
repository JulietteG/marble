Life is a canvas you paint in the mind
Colors dance, spill outside the lines
I refuse to settle, never the black and white
Rock the neons until the day I die

Im on a constant search to make my heart swell
Bite off too much, chew like hell
Half my nights spent in a hotel
Price I paid to escape the conveyor belt

One, you get one heartbeat so, take it seriously
This is your masterpiece, dont forget to dream
And taste the colors in the air you breathe
Its your masterpiece, go ahead and feel it all
Dont stop till it is beautiful
(Oh whoa)
Dont stop till it is beautiful
(Oh whoa)
Dont stop till it is beautiful

Close my eyelids, take a deep breath
Feel the lightening down to my chest
Im just a piece of art, and the paints fresh
Cuz Im not yet finished yet
Ive got a pregnant mind that wants to give birth
Breathe life into these big words
I can hear the universe in my ear

She whispers, you get one, one heartbeat so take it seriously
This is your masterpiece, dont forget to dream
And taste the colors in the air you breathe
Its your masterpiece, go ahead and feel it all
Dont stop till it is beautiful
Oh whoa)
Dont stop till it is beautiful
(Oh whoa)
Dont stop till it is beautiful
And you can settle for a normal life
Said that your afraid of heights
But you were meant to light the sky

This is your masterpiece
Dont forget to breathe and taste the colors in the air you breathe
This is your masterpiece go ahead and feel it all
Dont stop till it is beautiful
Oh whoa)
Dont stop till it is beautiful
(Oh whoa)
Dont stop till it is beautiful
(Oh whoa..)
Dont stop till it is beautiful---
