(Verse 1)
I was nearly a soul getting ready to go
Having one last talk with my maker
He said you're going to earth for better or worse
We'll see you back here sooner or later

So I said to him, as I spread my wings
Would you do one thing for me

(chorus)
Would you build me a girl from all over the world
I promise I will always adore you
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and smile from California
Brazilian walk, head from New York, pretty Parisian curls
Build me a girl
Build me a girl

(Verse 2)
Well the days went by
Wondering why, why it was I hadn't found her
I was staring at eyes
Smiling at smiles
Still I was none the wiser

And you know I don't
Don't mean to impose
But I thought we had a deal

(chorus)

(Bridge)
So calling all woman who fit this description
If I'm what you're missing
Then please just listen to the wind
The clouds they're all screaming out, they're trying to bring you to me
So please don't shut them out
Because there is a lady who is made for me
Yes, there is a lady who has been made for me

(chorus) x2---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
