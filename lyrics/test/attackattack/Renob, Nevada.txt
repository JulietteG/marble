Go 
Your words are just as simple as the next
You know my heart meant no disrespect
It seems that there is nothing left
(No honor, No respect!)

Your mind is just as confused as the next
Keep your opinion to yourself

Go!
Take your opinion
with you!
Cause I don't want to hear it!
Go!
Take your decisions 
With you!
Cause I don't need to her them
(You know exactly who you are)

Your voice is crawling at my ears all day
Leaving me restless and plaguing my mind
Your lies are clouding up my thought everyday
Seeing your motives realizing its jealousy

(No honor, No respect!)
(No honor, No respect!)
You know exactly who you are!


Your voice is crawling at my ears all day
Leaving me restless and plaguing my mind
Your lies are clouding up my thought everyday
Seeing your motives realizing its jealousy

I can see right through you
I can see right through you

Go!
Take your opinion!
With you!
Cause I don't want to hear it!
Go!
Take your decisions!
Cause I don't want to hear them!
Go!...---Lyrics submitted by Brooke Lynn.
