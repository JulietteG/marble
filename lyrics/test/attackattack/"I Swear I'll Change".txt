Seeing everyone's true face
It makes me wish they would keep their masks on
'Cause I don't wanna know, who you really are
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now

True face exposed, dark motives in the light
Was listening too scary for you?
You haven't changed, you never will

You and I will never be the same,
You say you try, but you never change
You can hide, and say you're not to blame
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now

I was wrong
Something in me still has some hope for you
But I don't know why
Everyone is not as good as they seem
Just trust in me,
Just trust in me, trust in me.

I never knew that lying came so natural to you
Cause I can't bear to see, the man you're gonna be
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now

You and I will never be the same,
You say you try, but you never change
You can hide, and say you're not to blame
I thought you have learned your lesson by now

You and I will never be the same,
You say you try, but you never change
You can hide, and say you're not to blame
And I thought you have learned your lesson by now ---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine Davis.
