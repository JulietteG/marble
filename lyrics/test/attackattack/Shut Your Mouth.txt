I don't give a.
Welcome to my party as I'm lettin' you in raise my hand
to the dj let the music begin McSwagger is the type man
to hold the world in his hand my name will be
on all your lips and typed by 
all your fingertips baby don't keep coming up to me I hope
you know you lack originality I don't drop my pants
that easily so baby, just get away from me, 
I don't wanna have to make you cry, 
I don't wanna leave with you tonight.
I don't give a.

Shut your mouth baby girl you're nothing new
I hate everything you do try to get away from you
I cant breathe when you're always close to me so go whoa.
Whoa.
It don't mean I'm from your future if I'm not
part of your past the feeling that you got,
you'll sober up and it wont last.
Swag-dad can see that your use to moving fast
but now I'm VIP I'm the lead in every cast baby,
I don't wanna talk to you all the thing that you're
doing ain't nothing new I can tell just what you want
to do so just get away from me,
I don't wanna have to make you cry,
I don't wanna leave with you tonight.

Mcswagger in your car
Mcswagger in your stereo
Mcswagger part oif every single bump and grind scenario
Mcswagger in your ear
Mcswagger in your head
Mcswagger is a super star that you dream of in your bed.
I don't give a.

Shut your mouth baby girl, you're nothing new, 
I hate everything you do
Try to get away from you I cant breathe when you're
always close to me so go whoa.
Whoa.---Lyrics submitted by janae.
