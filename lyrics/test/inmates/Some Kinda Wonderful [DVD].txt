Let's go!!

I said a 1,2,3, take my hand and come with me
 'Cause you look so fine 
And I really wanna make you mine. 
I said you look so fine 
And I really wanna make you mine.

Oh, 4,5,6 come on and get your kicks
 Now you don't need that money 
When you look like that, do ya honey?

Big black boots,  / Long brown hair, 
She's so sweet  / With her get back stare.

Well I could take,  / You home with me, 
But you were with another man, yeah!
 I know we ain't got, much to say, 
Before I let you get away, yeah!

 I said, are you gonna be my girl?

I could see, You home with me, 
But you were with another man, yeah!
 I know we, ain't got much to say, 
Before I let you get away, yeah!
Oh Yeah / Oh Yeah / C'mon

 Uh, be my girl. /  Be my girl.
 Are you gonna be my girl? Yeah!---Lyrics submitted by voxman.
