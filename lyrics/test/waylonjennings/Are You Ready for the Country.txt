Slippin' and a slidin' playin' Dominos
Leftin' and a rightin' ain't a crime you know
Well, I gotta tell the story
Before it's time to go.

Are you ready for the country
Are you ready for me
Are you ready for the country
Ain't that a sight to see?

Talkin' to a preacher
Said God was on his side
Talkin' to a butcher
They both were sellin' hides.

Well, I gotta tell the story boys
I don't know the reason why

Are you ready for the country
Are you ready for me
Are you ready for the country
Ain't that a sight to see?

Are you ready for the country
Are you ready for me
Are you ready for the country
Ain't that a sight to see?... ---
