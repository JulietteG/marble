It is the evening of the day,
I sit and watch the children play.
Smiling faces I can see, but not for me,
I sit and watch as tears go by.

My riches can't buy everything,
I want to hear the children sing.
All I hear is the sound of rain falling on the ground,
I sit and watch as tears go by.

It is the evening of the day,
I sit and watch the children play.
Doin' things I used to do, they think are new,
I sit and watch as tears go by.
Mm mm mm...

I sit and watch as tears go by,
I sit and watch as tears go by.---Lyrics submitted by Kay.
