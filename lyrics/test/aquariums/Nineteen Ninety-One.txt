The year nineteen ninety one;
That December, your last
I never really knew who you were
And I apologize for never really crying
I did not fully grasp the concept of dying
But now as I look back
I understand the feelings they had
Fifteen years later I go through your drawer
There are so many things still left to explore
Locked on my wrist, is a memory of you slowly passing time.---Lyrics submitted by Martin.
