Turn look, look out and see.
Do you see me? Cause I think I see you.
I've been some other place.
The wind that I chase, it all just leads back to you.
Oh how I'm still, so still it's sobering, but still I ran.
I knew you when I was young, but where am I now
That I'm a man?

Run to you, I will run, I will run
I will move, right on through all these things I have done.
And you'll take me back, I don't know why.
I wanna say I'll never do it again, but I can't
But I will try.

Turn and look, look out and see.
Do you see me? Cause I think I see you.
I've been some other place.
The wind that I chase it all just leads back to you.
Oh how I miss what you miss, but I will fall time and again.
And I will say, that I'm true to you, but I'm a cheat.
I don't understand.

So I'll run to you, I will run, I will run
I will move, right on through all these things I have done.
And you'll take me back, I don't know why.

I wanna say I'll never do it again, but I can't

I wanna say I'll never do it again, but I can't

I wanna say I'll never do it again, but I can't
But I will try.---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
