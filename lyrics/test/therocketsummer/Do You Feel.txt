I'm thinkin about other things I heard about today.
All this week and tomorrow.
And how these hands can create some better things for betterin.
But you see for now I got my own things.

I can't help it
I got too many issues I own
So I can not help I'm afraid, Yeah.
But keep on preachin, preachin and heal the world.
Lip service makes us look great.

Do you feel?
The weight of the world singin sorrow
Or to you is it just not real?
Cause you got you're own things
Yeah, We all have our things I guess

I guess my mind wanders off
From time to time
Sometimes I convince myself
That all is fine in the world
It's not mine
Why should I have to try to fix
Things I didn't create or contrive?

Do you feel?
The weight of the world singin sorrow
Or to you is it just not real?
Cause you got you're own things
Yeah, We all have so many things

Have the habits had you?
Has it been for long?
Can you feel the souls behind what's goin on?

Do you feel?
The weight of the world singin sorrow
Or to you is it just not real?
Cause you got your own things
Yeah, We all have our things

Do you feel?
The weight of the world singin sorrow
Or to you is it just not real?
Cause you got you're own things
Cause we all have so many things
And I can't get past these things

Oh Oh Oh Oooooooohhhhh!---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
