Now, Let's take it back to January.
An overflowin heart an empty wallet scene.
Some wheels and a guitar, yeah.
You think we're crazy.
Drivin on the ways of the hot and free.
And so we just hold on.

I remember rollin through some state into a hotel scene.
With pennies to my name.
I remember thinkin I can't sleep but she's lovin me.
And so we just hold on, Just hold on.

And here with you under these covers.
I'll stay with you, There is no other.
We share a name, We share a wonder.
And on the roads ahead.
We'll keep goin further, Yeah, Yeah.

And all the struggles and honorable mentions.
That pave our history we're all of my attention.
It's just surroundin you, I forget all that has used me.
Bruised me, Roamin on the thrill.

And here with you under these covers.
I'll stay with you, There is no other.
We share a name, We share a wonder.
And on the roads ahead.
We'll keep goin further

The rest is right, the rest is wrong.
The rest will come when it comes along.
The rest will find us, We belong here, Oh, Oh, Oh, Yeah!

And here with you under these covers.
I'll stay with you, There is no other.
We share a name, We share a wonder.
And on the roads ahead.
We'll keep goin further

And here with you under these covers.
I'll stay with you, There is no other.
We share a name, We share a wonder.
And on the roads ahead.
We'll keep goin further

The rest is right, the rest is wrong.
The rest will come when it comes along.
The rest will find us, We belong here.---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
