i'm an elf, a santa's helper, you see
i keep watch
while he's down the chimneys
and one night, i saw something so pretty
that i
i, i
i went through the window
and i,
i,
i hid in the shadows
my, my
my heart beat crescendoed
high, high
and i saw a... girl

for twenty years, i keep going on back (back, back)
i pay the reindeer to keep it under the wraps
i'm not a stalker (i promise)
i'm just a real big fan

high, high
i went through the window
and i,
i,
i hid in the shadows
my, my
my heart beat crescendoed
ah, ah
i just stood there

oh, how alone
how christmas comes
then christmas goes
and i'm all alone
left in my head
are images
three-hundred-sixty-four more days
until i'm watching her... sleep

i'm such an elf... creep
the time has come
the night is here
all the best lines and poems
i've rehearsed and rehearsed for years
i woke her up and said 'sugar, don't you fear'
she screamed so loud she busted the drums
in my pointy spock ears

i ran out
out, out
i ran out the window
and how, how
her screams sorely echoed
now, now
i'm banned for life from hot cocoa
but it's fine, yeah it's fine
cause she knows that i exist
she knows,
she knows that i exist
she knows,
she knows that i exist
she knows
she knows that i exist
she knows
she knows that i exist.---Lyrics submitted by Paul Herrin.
