I'm moved when I see it.
You gotta feel it, oh.
Troubled with the TV on.
Feel so devastated and activated.
Oh come on.
Come on lets see some action.
I say it's no secret, So don't you keep it.
Come on and get on the floor and just...

Break it out, Get it all out.
And start freakin out.
Just so we can make it out.
Get off your feet and make it count.
OHHH!

Oh, Friends please excuse me.
I put it loosely, Oh.
I'm sick and tired of sittin down.
I can't help but see the reasons to what I'm readin.
Oh, The coffee mornin's in this town.
I'm done with ignorance, Is bliss and for this.
I'm gonna hu, Hu, Hurry and get up, Get out.
Make this be for somethin or else it's all just nothin.

Break it out, Get it all out.
And start freakin out.
Just so we can make it out.
Get off your feet and make it count.
OHHH YEA!

When I started this, I knew it was not just for this.
Selfish pleasure of my own, Not for me, But for my oath.
My oath.
My oath.

Break it out, Get it all out.
And start freakin out.
Just so we can make it out.
Get off your feet and make it count.
OHHH...Yea!

Break it out, Get it all out.
And start freakin out.
Just so we can make it out.
Get off your feet and make it count.
OHHH!---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
