Can't you find something else to talk about?
Is this song the only one you sing?
Makes you look better when you put things down?
Value your opinion!

Don't criticize my friends
Criticize my ideas

Don't criticize my life style

I'm fed up 'cause all you want to do is criticize.

You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!
You don't realize, all you want to do is criticize.
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize.

Now can't we talk this over?
Cause your conversation ain't right.
We can make our love stronger
You don't have to think twice.

Don't criticize my friends
Criticize my ideas

You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!

Don't criticize my motive
Criticize my feeling

Don't criticize my business

I'm fed up 'cause all you want to do is criticize.

You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize!---
