**I'm Outta Here**

Mind if I sit down? 
Can I buy you a round? 
Haven't seen your face before 
Are you new in town? 
It's the same old line 
Oh every time 
Are you here alone? 
Can I take you home? 

Now every woman sees 
With every "pretty please" 
There's a pair of lyin' eyes 
And a set of keys 
He says come be a star 
In the back seat of my car 
Oh but baby slow down 
You're goin' way too far 

Let me make it clear 
To you my dear 

If you're not 
In it for love  
If you're not 
Willin' to give it all you got 
If you're not in it for life 
If you're not in it for love 
Let me make it clear 
To you my dear 
If you're not in it for love 
I'm outta here! 

Babe I can change your world 
Make you a cover girl 
Yeah you could be a beauty queen 
In a magazine 
Now tell me, what's your sign? 
Why always the same old line? 
I'll be in number 409 
If you change your mind 

Let me make it clear 
To you my dear 

If you're not 
In it for love  
If you're not 
Willin' to give it all you got 
If you're not in it for life 
If you're not in it for love 
Let me make it clear 
To you my dear 
you're not in it for love 
I'm outta here! 

If you're not 
In it for love.... baby
If you're not 
Willin' to give it all you got 
If you're not in it for life 
If you're not in it for love 
If your not in it for life 
If yor not in it for love

I'm outta here!---Lyrics submitted by Rosemarie.
