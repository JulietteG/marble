Let's Go
mmmm...
Don't wantcha for the weekend
Don't wantcha for a night
I'm only interested if i can have ya for life
Yea...
I know I sound serious
And baby I am
Yo... I found a piece of realastate and I'm going to get me some land
Oh... yea
So don't try to run hunny... love can be fun
There's no need to be alone... when you find that someone
I'm going to getcha while I gotcha inside (I'm going to getcha)
I'm going to getcha if it takes all night (you can betcha)
You can betcha by the time I say "go" you'll never say "no"
I'm going to getcha... It's a matter of fact (I'm going to getcha)
I'm going to getcha... don'tcha worry about that (I'm going to getcha)
You can betcha about a dollar in time you're going to be mine (I'm going to getcha)
Just like I should... I'll getcha good
Yea...
I've already planned it
Here's how it's going to be
Uh...I'm going to love you... and you're going to fall in love with me
Yea...
So don't try to run hunny... love can be fun
There's no need to be alone... when you find that someone
(I'm going to getcha) I'm going to getcha while I gotcha inside (I'm going to getcha)
I'm going to getcha if it takes all night (you can betcha)
You can betcha by the time I say "go" you'll never say "no"
I'm going to getcha... It's a matter of fact (I'm going to getcha)
I'm going to getcha... don'tcha worry about that (I'm going to getcha)
You can betcha about a dollar in time you're going to be mine (I'm going to getcha)
Just like I should... I'll getcha good
Uh...Uh... Yea I'm going to getcha baby... I'm going to knock on wood
I'm going to getcha somehow...hunny... yea I'm going to make it good
Yea...Yea...Yea...Yea...Yea
Oh...Yea
So don't try to run hunny... love can be fun
There's no need to be alone... when you find that someone
(I'm going to getcha) I'm going to getcha... It's a matter of fact (I'm going to getcha)
You can betcha about a dollar in time you're going to be mine (I'm going to getcha)
Oh..I'm going to getcha (I'm going to getcha) I'm going to getcha real good (I'm going to getcha)
You can betcha (I'm going to getcha) Oh... I'm going to getcha (I'm going to getcha)
Just like I should... I'll getcha good
Oh... I'm going to getcha good---Lyrics submitted by tierney.
