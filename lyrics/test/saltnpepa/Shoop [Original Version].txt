Hey, yeah - I wanna shoop, baby 

(Oooo, how you doin', baby? 
No, not you 
You, the bow-legged one, (ha-ha) yeah 
What's your name? 
Damn, that sounds sexy) 

Here I go, here I go, here I go again (again?) 
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!) 
Ok then, chillin', chillin', mindin' my business (word) 
Yo, Salt, I looked around, and I couldn't believe this 
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness 
The brother had it goin' on with somethin' kinda...uh 
Wicked, wicked (oooo) - had to kick it 
I'm not shy so I asked for the digits 
A ho? No, that don't make me 
See what I want slip slide to it swifty 
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks 
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks for him 
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked 
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit 
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do 
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop shoop shoop 

Shoop shoop ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop 
Shoop ba-doop ba-doop ba-doop

Ummm, you're packed and you're stacked 'specially in the back 
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (thanks, Mom) 
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie? 
If looks could kill you would be an uzi 
You're a shotgun - bang! What's up with that thang? 
I wanna know how does it hang? 
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover 
Like Prince said you're a sexy mutha- 
Well-a, I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile 
Smooth black skin with a smile 
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun 
Come (come) and (hmmm) give me some of that yum-yum 
Chocolate chip, honey dip, can I get a scoop? (please) 
Baby, take a ride in my coupe, you make me wanna... 

Shoop shoop ba-doop (Baby, hey)

Well let me bring you back to the subject, Pep's on the set 
Make you get hot, make you work up a sweat 
When you skip-to-my-lou, my darling 
Not falling in love but I'm falling for your (super sperm) 
When I get ya betcha bottom dollar you were best under pressure 
(Yo, Sandy, I wanna like, taste you) 
Getcha getcha lips wet cuz it's time to have Pep 

On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop 
To the next man in the three-piece suit 
I spend all my dough, ray me, cutie 
Shoop shoop a-doobie like Scoobie Doobie Doo 
I love you in your big jeans, you give me nice dreams 
You make me wanna scream, "Oooo, oooo, oooo!"

You make me wanna shoop

He's the cutest brother in here 
And he's comin' this way! Oooo!) 

S and the P wanna kick with me, cool (uh-huh) 
But I'm wicked, G, (yeah) hit skins but never quickly (that's right) 
I hit the skins for the hell of it, just for the yell I get 
Mmm mmm mmm, for the smell of it (smell it) 
They want my bod, here's the hot rod (hot rod) 
Twelve inches to a yard (damn) and have ya soundin' like a retard (yeah) 
Big 'Twan Love-Her, six-two, wanna hit you 
So what you wanna do?
