I would be you
you would be me
we would be one
we would be just fine
The ice caps wouldn't be melting and neither would I (hmm)
I would just drive my big old car and everything would be alright
And energy would just fall down right from the sky (yeah) 
Words would fly right from out of my mouth , out of mind into your heart, into your life and everything would sound just right and no one would stop me from drinking my wine

That's my dreamworld, That's my dreamworld, It's more than a dream, dreamworld that's my dreamworld and I wanna live in my dream (dream)

Oh the real world just don't feel right
I wouldn't spend my days, searching for,  searching for lost time (dream)
I wouldn't be so damn sensitive, I'd let things go by
No matter what the weather, I'd learn to change, I'd change with the time (yeah)
And everytime I'd meet a woman she would be right by me 
She'd hold me tight, treat me right and tell me that everything is gonna, is gonna be allright
allright

That's my dreamworld, That's my dreamworld

I would tell Van Gogh that he was loved there's no need to cry (hmm)
I would say Marvin Gaye your father didn't want you to die (dream)

There would be no black or white, the world would just treat my wife right. Hey Hey (dream)
We could walk down in Mississippi no one would look at us twice

That's my dreamworld, That's my dreamworld, It's more than a dream
Dreamworld that's my dreamworld. And I wanna live in the Dream
Let's Dream, Let's Dream, Let's Dream
Dream on (4 times)
Let's Dream (4 times)
Dream on (2 times)
Let's Dream (dream)
Let's Dream (dream on) Let's Dream 
Dream on Baby (dream) ohh (dream on) dream on---Lyrics submitted by brenda.
