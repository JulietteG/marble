I'm fascinated by your stare
I went through all your fancy clothes
I wanna shop for your underwear
I wanna do it all so cold

Do it do it in my dry cleaner
Do it do it in my dry cleaner

[Chorus:]
Why don't you take it easy on me
Take it easy on me, take it easy
Why don't you take it easy on me
Take it easy on me, take it easy
Do it
And take it easy on me
Do it
And take it easy on me

Baby, I can it worth your while
Don't need your telephone number
I'm right here now
I'm a line up like the 4th of July
When I look right through your dress
I want your cherry pie
Come here, but take your time
I know your time is valuable, baby
But so is mine
Don't let it, this chance go by
Baby, heard that you one badass chick
But so am I

[Chorus]

Baby, I ain't never been the type
To dance, but tonight may be the night
I get on it
A few shots of the Patron, might lose my mind
And I might lose my balance
Because I hit that blunt too many times
Come down is what I have to do myself
Cause when I get in my zone
I can't even see nobody else
I'm standing on furniture
And my outfit's so fly
They telling me I should relax
And I'm just like, why

[Chorus]

Do it, do it, come on ---
