Love after war [x4]

Ooh it's a knock-out baby, you won the fight
I said I'm sorry that I acted like a selfish child
Please forgive me baby, I was out of line
You know I can make it right
Don't you love it when we fight

(Love after war)
I need you tonight baby
(Love after war)
Come on and let me make it right baby
(Love after war)
I'm knockin' on your door
(Love after war)
You know I want it, you know I want that

Caught in lies, girl's cry, doors slam and broken lights
Bottles hit the TV screen
You gotta go, or I'm gonna leave
Throwing clothes into the yard
When we go we go so hard
It only makes me want you more, more, more

(Love after war)
I need you tonight baby
(Love after war)
Come on and let me make it right baby
(Love after war)
I'm knockin' on your door
(Love after war)
You know I want it,

Don't you leave
That's all we need
All we need
That's all we need
That's all we need

(Love after war)
I just wanna love you lady
(Love after war)
Wanna put down our weapons baby
(Love after war)
Lay your clothes down on the floor
(Love after war)
And give me some love after war

(Love after war)
You know it's gonna be your night baby
(Love after war)
You know the way that we fight baby
(Love after war)
Just drink this glass of wine
(Love after war)
And girl remember you're mine
(Love after war)
Remember you're mine baby, you're mine baby
(Love after war)
Come on and let me in
(Love after war)
Let me in, let me in, let me in...
(Love after war)
You know I want it, you know I want you baby
You know I want you baby
You know I want you baby ---Lyrics submitted by shirley david h.
