I want something else. I want something else

I'm a man, I love my drink
I like the girls, I've walked these streets
But I need a break,  some new town Cause the way it tastes
It is going down (I say)

I want something else yeah
I love the stuff It's never enough babe
I want something else you know what I need just give it to me please
Losing control, I'm about to explode tonight

I got a girl she's tired of this city
She wants to go where she feels pretty (yes)
She wants a new mind sexy all the time
In the middle of the dinner she whispers in my ear (says)

I want something else hey
I love the stuff It's never enough babe
I want something else you know what I need just give it to me please
Losing control, I'm about to explode tonight
I need to know [x8] It's never enough [x8] 

I want something else hey ehh
I love the stuff babe It's never enough babe
I want something else (more) you know what I need just give it to me please, please
I want something else ehh, ehhh
oh I love the stuff It's never enough sing
I want something else you know what I need just give it to me please
Losing control, I'm about to explode tonight---Lyrics submitted by Jacob.
