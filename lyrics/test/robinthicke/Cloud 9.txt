No hour of need

Don't you worry baby

Delusional people
Livin life too fast
So I'm takin my time
Sittin here livin here on cloud 9

Like a bird on a wire

Could'a ruled the world
And stuff like that
Never enters my mind
Sittin here livin on cloud 9
Oh livin on cloud 9 baby

Oh come and sit down right here next to me

Livin on cloud 9
