If it told that I love would you run away or would you run to me
I need to know it baby
If gave you all my loving would you give it back
What would you do with that
I asked a lot of that
And if gave you all my time when is the summer time
I know my down time, girl that's a lot of time
If I'm falling over you, then what you gonna do
I wanna cuddle you, I wanna run with you
I'd give you all my loving to you
I'd give you all my loving to you

If I partied till the morning would you stay with me
Girl would you play with me, or would you hate on me
If I ran all out of money, would you pay for me or would you stray from me
I need to know it baby
If there's something that I could do to make you cheat lie
Girl that I treat you right, id do it every night
Every second that I'm with you is a special world
Like I'm your only man, and your my only girl

I'd give you all my loving to you
I'd give you all my loving to you

Does it feel good
Oh babe oh darling
Does it feel good
Does it feel good

I'd give you all my loving to you
I'd give you all my loving to you
