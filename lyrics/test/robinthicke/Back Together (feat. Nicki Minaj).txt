Yeah
Hey Robin!

Didn't I rock with you all night?
Wasn't it good enough? Don't lie
Didn't you tell me that I blew your mind?
Brought out the animal in me
Nobody else can tame that beast
Why did you have to go and say goodbye?

Now all I wanna do is get, get you back (get, get)
Cause girl, you're still the best that I've ever had
A one, two, three, let's go

You used your love to tear me apart
Now fuck me back together (now fuck me back together)
You put a bullet into my heart
Now fuck me back together
Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart
Now fuck me back together

I wanna live between your legs
Hear all the freaky things you said
I don't like what you're turning me into, into
Baby, you left me on the floor
Now I keep driving past your door
I don't know why you gotta be so cruel (I dont know why)

Now all I wanna do is get, get you back
(Wanna get you back, yeah, yeah, baby, get you back)
Cause girl you're still the best that I've ever had
A one, two, three, let's go

You used your love to tear me apart (you used your love)
Now fuck me back together (now fuck me back together)
You put a bullet into my heart (straight into my heart)
Now fuck me back together
Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart (you used your love)
Now fuck me back together (together, baby)

Yo!
Ayo, Robin
I get more head than when they noddin
Kitty on fleek, its popping, Im Mary Poppins
Just for the record, that heart is what Im copping
Blasting 2Pac in some fishnet stockings
You know you miss this ride
M-I-S-S, miss this pie
Used to call me Hillary cause I ride em (Rodham)
I said, ring, ring, ring, ring, ra-ring, ring
Put a ring on it or ding, da-ding, ding
Boy your times up, whered you wind up?
Theres levels to this (uhh!), you shoulda climbed up
(Let's go)

You used your love to tear me apart
Now fuck me back together (now put me back together)
You put a bullet into my heart (right into my heart)
Now fuck me back together
Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart (you used your love)
Now fuck me back together (fuck me back together)

Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart (you used your love)
Now fuck me back together
Fuck me back together---
