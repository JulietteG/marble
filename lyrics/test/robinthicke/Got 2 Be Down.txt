All this love and aggravation
I wasted so much of my life
All this truth and separation
We work so hard 2 make things right

Got that lovin got that seed
Got that suga got that sweet
Got that money got that beat
Got that whatever u need
Oh I cant hide it ure my world
Got me thinking Im no good
Chocolate lover youre so sweet
Got me thinkin on my feet

Therell be no problems 2 get out of
I got 2 be down
And amazing or Ill go crazy
In this house
I got 2 be down

U were always number one 2 me
Even when I cursed your name
And if I could
I wouldve been gone
But nothings like being in love with u

Got that lovin got that seed
Got that suga got that sweet
Got that money got that beat
Got that whatever u need
Oh I cant hide it youre my world
Got me thinking Im no good
Chocolate lover youre so sweet
Got me thinkin on my feet

Therell be no problems 2 get out of
I got 2 be down
And amazing or Ill go crazy
In this house
I got 2 be down
We gotta get it together we gotta stick together
We gotta stay together we gotta get it together---Lyrics submitted by Shenieka.
