Cause she shakin' it for daddy
She shakin' it for me
She shakin' it for daddy
She shakin' for me
She liftin' up her ass
And she drop it to the beat
She shakin' it so fast for the cash
Ching-a-ling

She ready and and she lookin' for a bank roll
She move round and round like a merry-go-round
She be like, I be I be I be on that money shit
She be like, I be I be I be on that money shit

And yo,
I be I be I be I be I be on that money shit
Get that slappy stoppy
Ride you coppy, I be runnin' shit
Money in the air it's a festival
Cause I ba-ba-ball no testicles (ha)
I'm flier than an eagle that's balding
I throw it back like hair lines that's balding
I stay balling, I don't mean Spalding
I never answer when the referee's calling

She got me jerkin' the club
Think I'm bout to fall in look
Cause she make that booty role
When she's comin' down the pole
That's when she got my heart
From cash to credit cards
Got me spending all my money
Shit, I could've bought a car

You know you like it babe
You know you like it babe
Yeah I like it babe
Yeah I like it babe
You know you want it babe
Yeah you want it babe
Yeah I want it babe, oh-ooh

Cause she shakin' it for daddy
She shakin' it for me
She shakin' it for daddy
She shakin' for me
She liftin' up her ass
And she drop it to the beat
She shakin' it so fast for the cash
Ching-a-ling

She ready and and she lookin' for a bank roll
She move round and round like a merry-go-round
She be like, I be I be I be on that money shit
She be like, I be I be I be on that money shit

And then this other girl grabbed me
And she whispered in my ear
She said this other girl ain't doin' nothing
It's crackin' over here
She put my hand on her booty
And her jiggle made me woozy
Now we're bout to make a movie
And the club goin' stupid

You know you like it babe
You know you like it babe
Yeah I like it babe
Yeah I like it babe
You know you want it babe
Yeah you want it babe
Yeah I want it babe

Cause she shakin' it for daddy
She shakin' it for me
She shakin' it for daddy
She shakin' for me
She liftin' up her ass
And she drop it to the beat
She shakin' it so fast for the cash
Ching-a-ling

She ready and and she lookin' for a bank roll
She move round and round like a merry-go-round
She be like, I be I be I be on that money shit
She be like, I be I be I be on that money shit

You was sleepin' on me
Thinkin' it was slumber time
Now I'm a trending topic
Lil' Mama number sign
Wa-wanna play?
Meet at the fumble line
Cause I'm a ninja
C-cowabunga time
Buzzin' like a bee
But nope I don't sting-a-ling
Jing-a-ling-a-ling, I show him the middle finger ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling
School bell a-ring-a-ling
Stick shift the ding-a-ling
Ball like Yao Ming-a-ling

Excuse me, What happened?
I'm flier than a robin
I'm flier than an eagle, yea Donovan McNubban
And when I pop that pussy
I pop it on his Suzuki
I pop it so crazy cooky
I'm rockin them daisy dukies

I be shakin' it for daddy, he want more more more
Got that Bentley, Got that caddy and they're all 4 door
If I pull him by the collar, boy he gonna hollar
I be shakin' it for daddy, he want more more more

Cause she shakin' it for daddy
She shakin' it for me
She shakin' it for daddy
She shakin' for me
She liftin' up her ass
And she drop it to the beat
She shakin' it so fast for the cash
Ching-a-ling

She ready and and she lookin' for a bank roll
She move round and round like a merry-go-round
She be like, I be I be I be on that money shit
She be like, I be I be I be on that money shit

Yeah girl

She shake it for daddy

She shake it
She shake it
She shake it

I be on that money shit
I be on that money shit
I be on that money shit
I be on that money shit (OH! )---Lyrics submitted by Robyn.
