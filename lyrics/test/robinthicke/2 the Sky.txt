Its amazing the way the darkness falls
and the truth out there is cold
nothing will keep you warm

Jealousy lies within me
gotta feeling the sun wont shine today (ohhh)
and i gotta know right now (oow)
will i be rich? have everything i want?
i stop myself and look 2 the sky

oooh i gotta give myself up 2 the skyyy
 the only truth is in the skyyy

Nobody else can tell 
cuz im stuck in a spell
of greed, and anger, and hate
oh i tried,i tried, i tried, i tried to rise above it
it comes right back creeps up on me
and hits me double time

This cant be my faith 
its never too late
I wake up holding on to this place
and there's nothing else i can do
but to give my self up 2 the skyyyyyyyyy

Take me 
Take me, Take to the skyyyyyy

Take me 
Take me 
Take me
2 the skyy

oh its so wrong out here
i need the sky

so cold out here
come and save me
need to fly high

oh i gotta give myself 2 the sky

hooo hooo ooohh
oooooo
2 the sky to the sky 

when you ask urself
hey why me? and why not me? 
when ur down on ur knees
hey look 2 the sky wooo
just look 2 the sky

you dont need no faster car or no bigger house
all you really need is rest and love
hey 2 the skyyy
woooo
throw up ur hands 
just throw up ur heart
all u really need is looovee oohh
im coming home
come on home
oooooooohhh oooo---Lyrics submitted by govanna.
