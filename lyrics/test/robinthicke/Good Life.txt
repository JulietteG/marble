In my own town, there is no street with my name
No crown, I am no king and the kids they don't know my name
It's like nothing has changed

Life takes you up and down, and life spins you all around
The good life, I know I made it the good life
I know I've made it with you

In my own town, my friends are saying what happened to you
We thought you made it, and you'd be driving bentleys and living the good life over sun
My father says when will you ever make it
My mother says you'll learn to fake it
But I'm not you and you're not me
But I'm as good as I can be baby

Life takes you up and down, and life spins you all around
The good life, I know I made it the good life
I know I've made it
And life takes you up and down, and life spins you all around
The good life, I know I made it the good life
I know I've made it with you

Oh I know that this the good life
I can see
I know that this the good life
I can see
I wanna live...

And God say I know I made it the good life
Open your eyes, your friends, your lover, your soul, your mind
It's, it's right there baby all the time it goes like

Life takes you up and down, and life spins you all around
The good life, I know I made it the good life
I know I've made it
And life takes you up and down, and life spins you all around
The good life, I know I made it the good life
I know I've made it with you

Oh I know that this the good life
I can see it baby
I know that this the good life
I wanna live the good life
Oh I know that this the good life
I can see it baby
Now I see it baby
I wanna live the good life ---
