Sister where are you going?
I didnt think that you were unhappy
If youre looking for meaning I dont think
Youll find it out on the road.
What do you find so unpleasant 
About this side of the country?
Running away from the problem
Works a lot on the solution at all.
Oh no no no no

Sister come back to your senses
Dont stray too far from where you came from 
Pulling up your roots stir your foundationll
Spin you out of control
Whats so appealing about a place
Thats simply across the ocean?
There aint no reason to leave	
The situations just as bad abroad.

Oh the thought of you leaving is bad
But the suspense is even worse
Oh if you wanna go then go
If you wanna stay then do so
just dont leave me leave me leave me
In a limbo
Oh no no no no

Sister listen to yourself
Youre just running away
You gotta stick it out
It aint easy but you gotta stay
If you go the stars aint aligned no more
Yeah something will be wrong with the world
You gotta stick it out even though
The situation is gray

Oh the thought of you leaving is bad
But the suspense is even worse
Oh if you wanna go then go
If you wanna stay then do so
just dont leave me leave me leave me
In a limbo
Oh if you wanna go then go
If you wanna stay then do so
just dont leave me leave me leave me
In a limbo
Oh no no no no

If you only listen to your senses
Yeah baby they tell you to go
You gotta do what you gotta do
Even if it means going alone
But if you want some direction
 Think youre making a mistake
You cant fix anything 
by running  it away yeah

Oh if you wanna go then go
If you wanna stay then do so
just dont leave me leave me leave me
In a limbo
Oh if you wanna go then go
If you wanna stay then do so
just dont leave me leave me leave me
In a limbo
No no

leave me leave me
In a limbo
No no

leave me leave me
In a limbo
No no

leave me leave me
In a limbo
No no---Lyrics submitted by Karl Dickey.
