Love all over the world
Makin' love all over the world
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love all over the world
Makin' love all over the world
Oh, oh, oh, oh

In my dreams you're falling
You're falling, you're falling down
I'm breaking, I'm breaking your rules
I really believe you can try to change your way
'Cause by the time you'll know
I'm gonna take your hand, won't let you go
We'll lose our mind, we'll lose our mind

Why don't you dance, dance, dance
And fall in love with friends?
Let's start a new romance
Oh, oh, uh, oh
Why don't you dance, dance, dance?
And fall in love with friends?
Let's start a new romance
Oh, oh, uh, oh
Why don't you dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance?

Love all over the world
Makin' love all over the world
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It feels lost thinking there's nothing to bring you up
I'll show you, I'll show we're no fools
I'll make you believe you can turn your life around
'Cause by the time you'll know
I'm gonna take your hand, won't let you go
We'll lose our mind, we'll lose our mind

Why don't you dance, dance, dance
And fall in love with friends?
Let's start a new romance

Why don't you dance, dance, dance
And fall in love with friends?
Let's start a new romance

Why don't you dance, dance, dance
And fall in love with friends?

And fall in love with friends?
