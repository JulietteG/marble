Don't wait for an invitation 
No need for reservation 
This life is an exploration 
And you gotta see what I see in you 

I can't wait one minute more 
The sun does shine, the sun does shine 
We can't wait one minute more 
The Sun does shine, the sun does shine 

Just think of a destination 
I'll be your transportation 
We'll find there's a kind of place 
That could only be seen with the naked mind 

There's a key that opens the door 
Will you find it and turn it 
Take your time, don't take too long 
There's a map that's washed ashore 
Will you find it and burn it 

Unleash your imagination 
Two stars, one constellation 
Bright lights just to guide the way 
Can you see, what I see in you?---
