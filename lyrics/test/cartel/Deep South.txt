I was born in the south,
Given to a town raised on handsome mouth.
Born on the same day as the sun,
Holding in the earth, seen one by one.

A dot in the cold, waiting to rot,
Frozen like stone, all is for not.
All that I am is churning inside,
All that I am is screaming:

[Chorus]
Go and get my bones,
Bring 'em to the deep south.
Oh yeah, somewhere they can thaw out,
(Oh oh oh) Here in the deep south (Oh oh oh)
Go and get my bones,
Bring 'em to the deep south.
Oh yeah, somewhere they can thaw out.
Oh, oh oh, here in the deep south, (Yeah) oh oh, oh.

I feel it in my skin,
Coming undone again and again.
Torn at the seam, my heart is sewn.
Holding back the tears shed on my own.

If dying is bold, then courage I've got,
I could grow old, but I forgot.
All that I am is churning inside,
The voice in my head is screaming:

[Chorus]

I was born in the south,
Given to a town raised on handsome mouth.
Born on the same day as the sun,
Counting every heartbeat one by one.

[Chorus x2]---Lyrics submitted by Kya Britten.
