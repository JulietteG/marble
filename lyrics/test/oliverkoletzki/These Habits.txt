Between pleasure and pain exists a fluid line
Ive let it happen again
to fall in love
if you break someones heart they say that you are unkind
Ive let it happen again
to break my heart 

and even though I could loose my heart
to someone wrong
I know that Id do it, I know that I would do it again
I know that Id do it, I know that I would do it again

I guess you already know that old habits die hard
but I keep telling you though
that Im still that way
it takes me so long to learn from mistakes
I should have known better
before

and even though I could loose my heart
to someone wrong
I know that Id do it, I know that I would do it again
I know that Id do it, I know that I would do it again

what I tell you now is my secret secret
So dont tell anyone
that I am hurt
it takes me so long to learn from mistakes
I should have known better
before

and even though I could loose my heart
to someone wrong
I know that Id do it, I know that I would do it again
I know that Id do it, I know that I would do it again

cant you learn from mistakes
enough is enough 
and after a time soft hands are getting rough
cant you learn from mistakes
enough is enough 
and after a time soft hands are getting rough---Lyrics submitted by Giga.
