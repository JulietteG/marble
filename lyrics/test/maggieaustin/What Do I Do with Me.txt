What do I do with me by Tanya Tucker
What do I do now that I am on my own?
What we did together,
Beats anything I have done alone. 
Since the day that you left, 
I have been asking myself, 
Is this how it is gonna to be? 
With you, what do I do with me?

I dont want to go out, 
But I just cant stay home. 
I dont need company, 
But I sure dont want to be alone.
And if telling myself that Im doing well, 
Is only makin believe. 
Without you, what do I do with me? 

Without you where do I go? 
Where do I turn? Id sure like to know. 
What do I do with all of our things? 
And how do I spend all this time on my hands? 

I have tried everything,
 Ive been wracking my brain. 
It must be as bad as it seems, 
Without you, what do I do with me?
Without you, what do I do with me?---Lyrics submitted by Catherine DeMarsh.
