(|:Ba ba ba ba ba:|)

She knows that life won't wait for you
to make up your mind.
So she's already made a move,
while you still try to decide.

She pulls out a machete and begins to chop off
all the loose ends that were stopping us up.
She knows the life won't wait for you
to make up your mind.

So she moves
at speed of dreams
at speed of dreams
at speed of dreams
she moves
at speed of dreams
at speed of dreams
at speed of dreams

(|:Ba ba ba ba ba:|)

She's like a sweetness of a superhero,
picks me up when I'm at zero,
rescues me with her special powers.

Arrives just in the nick of time,
and always seems to hear my mind,
put sweetness in a life that's gone sour.

The villains had us cornered and our love was fading,
she kicked in the doors up with her guns a blazing.
I'm almost under water with just my head above,
when suddenly she appears

'cause she moves
at speed of dreams
at speed of dreams
at speed of dreams
she moves
at speed of dreams
at speed of dreams
at speed of dreams

she moves
