I've made more mistakes
than I can count upon my fingertips.
I have been ashamed
and I have felt as guilty as all sin.
Counting every tear that drops
And not account for any loss.
I'll let the past remain behind me now.
Fill it up with goodness,
I'll drink it down with love.

(Chorus)
Never give up on me,
I will never give up on you.
You're everything I need.
Just look at what we've been through.

So far, so good.

I have wished on every star,
Thats shot across my broken heart.
I am still amazed that you came true.
I have kissed a hundred lips,
But none of them compared to this.
I have found myself inside of you.
You forgive my sad regrets,
And I forgive myself.

(chorus)(x2)

I love you---Lyrics submitted by Alana.
