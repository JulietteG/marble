Time flies when you're having fun
the aborted babies are the lucky ones
we live in a cold hard world 
the future will be unfurled
but it's alright it's alright 
fate will get done
it's alright it's alright 
fate will get done
history repeats itself
there's a heaven and there's a hell
can't undo whats been done
my advise to you is to carry on
but it's alright it's alright 
fate will get done
it's alright it's alright 
fate will get done
can't stand in the sinking sand
can't see the fire without getting burned
is never too late to turn back
someday you may have a heart attack
but it's alright it's alright 
fate will get done
it's alright it's alright 
fate will get done
it takes a heart to understand
in the dark you're a desperate man
but love can free your mind
take it in let your ora unwind 
but it's alright it's alright 
fate will get done
it's alright it's alright 
fate will get done
earth is an old canvas paint it over many times
wind blows as the ages roll
and time takes its toll
billions and billions and billions sold
but it's alright it's alright 
fate will get done
it's alright it's alright 
but it's alright it's alright 
but it's alright it's alright 
alright alright it's alright 
alright alright etc.---Lyrics submitted by Marc Antoine.
