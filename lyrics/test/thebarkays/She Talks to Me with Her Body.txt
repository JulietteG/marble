She talks to me with her body
She says, what you want I got it
So come on boy take me home
I guarantee you'll be turned on
There's no doubt about it

She talks to me with her body
It says, now what you want I've got it
So come on boy take me home
I guarantee I'll turn you on
Even if it takes me all night long

She talks to me without ever saying a word
So better believe, that the girl is always hurt 
She's got amazing smile, but the devil's in her eyes
She's got a way of saying I'm available for anything you want to try

She talks to me with her body
She says, what you want I got it
So come on boy take me home
I guarantee I'll turn you on
There's no doubt about it

She talks to me with her body
It says, now what you want I've got it
So come on boy take me home
I guarantee you'll be turned on
Even though it may take me all night long

The way she walks
It just drives me off the wall
From her lips to her hips
Her body movement says it all
She gets me up
She really excites my love
She makes me tremble every move I remember
She's all that I'm thinking of

She talks to me with her body it keeps sayin
What you want I've got it
So come on boy take me home
I guarantee you can't go wrong
There's no doubt about it

She talks to me with her body
It says, now what you want I've got it
So come on boy take me home
I guarantee you'll be turned on
Even if it takes me all night long

She talks to me with her body (she talks to me)
She talks to me with her body (with the way she walks)
She talks to me with her body (yeah she talks to me)
She talks to me with her body (she gets me off)

She talks to me with her body (yeah she talks to me)
She talks to me with her body (she don't try to hide it)
She talks to me with her body (she talks to me)
She talks to me with her body (she said she want to try me)---Lyrics submitted by OG Adam.
