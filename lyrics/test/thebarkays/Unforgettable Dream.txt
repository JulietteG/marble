Woman
I wanna hold you and squeeze you like I used to do
And make believe that I'm the king
And you're the queen of this love we share

And time after time I get the feeling
That I'm so in love with
And just to look out my window each night
I see the stars in love above

Let me love you, please you
And do all the things that you want me to do
Let me touch you, yes, kiss you
And show you what I feel inside my heart

(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
You're the light of my life and you mean so much to me
(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
I wanna tell the world how much I love you (My unforgettable dream)

(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
You're the light of my life and you mean so much to me
(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
I wanna tell the world how much I love you

Lady
Only you can fulfill all my happiness
Late at night I hear your voice
Even though you're really not there

Over and over there's a vision of you
In my life
When I look out my window each night
I think about you more than twice

Let me love, please you
And do all the things that you want me to do
Let me touch you, yes, kiss you
And show you what I feel inside my heart

(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
You're the light of my life and you mean so much to me
(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
I wanna tell (Oh, darlin') the world how much I love you

(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
You're the light (Oh) of my life and you mean so much to me
(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
I wanna tell (Oh, darlin') the world how much I love you (I love you)

Whoa, whoa, darlin'
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, darlin'
Whoa, whoa, yeah

Whoa, whoa, darlin'
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, darlin'
Whoa, whoa, yeah

Let me love, please you
And do all the things that you want me to do
Let me touch you, yes, kiss you
And show you what I feel inside my heart

Let me love, please you
And do all the things that you want me to do
Let me touch you, yes, kiss you
And show you what I feel inside

(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
You're the light of my life and you mean so much to me
(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream (Oh...yeah)
I wanna tell the world how much I love you

(My unforgettable dream) Unforgettable dream
You're the light of my life and you mean so much to me
