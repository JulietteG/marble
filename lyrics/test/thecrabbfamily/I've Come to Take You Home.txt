Go plead with your mother, were the words of Hosea
As he sent his children to extend his mercy
So they journeyed down the old path that lead to much destruction
All the while their loving hearts were hurting
Their hope was crushed inside as their compassion was denied
The woman they so loved seemed like a stranger
Heartbroken and alone they took the long road home
For sin now reigned and all hope seemed gone to change her

One day the word was told, some slaves were being sold
A restless love sent Hosea seeking, one by one they brought them in
So beaten down with sin, within his chest his anxious heart was beating
All at once she caught his eye, from his lips the bids were high
She could not believe the voice that she could hear
Would he through judgment take her life, forever end his pain and strife
What would happen as she saw him drawing near her

Ive come to take you home, I know that youve done wrong
But for you Id give my life
Through the sorrow, pain and strife I couldnt let you go
Lets leave the past behind
Love conquers one more time
He took her hand and said, theres a new day just ahead
Ive come to take you home

Now Ive stood in that same place, bound by sin, a broken slave
From the depths of my despair Ive prayed for mercy
I heard His word the price was paid on the cross for you that day
Take My hand now child and welcome to the family

Ive come to take you home, I know that youve done wrong
But for you I gave My life
Through the sorrow, pain and strife I couldnt let you go
Lets leave the past behind
Love conquers one more time
He took my hand and said, theres a new day just ahead
Ive come to take you home---Lyrics submitted by Denny W Garrett.
