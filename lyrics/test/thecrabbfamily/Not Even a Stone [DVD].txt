The soldiers led Jesus form a courtroom of mockery and nailed him to an old cross to die, 
They laughed at his statement, 
I'll live again, 
you'll see, 
One pierced a sharp spear in his side, 
and his crying was finished he was heard from the hillside,
 He was placed in a tomb by his friends, 
his words were remembered by mary his friends, 
His words were remembered by maryas she cried,
I must die but i'll live again.

Not even the grave clothes, 
Not even a stone, 
Not even the soldiers that watched  all night long, 
Not even the great Roman seal at the door, 
all the powers of darkness couldnt hold down our Lord.

If you journey to Jerusalem to the grave that held Jesus
you'll find that his body is gone
there's still an echo that shouts at the devil
your're defeated, 
Christ Jesus has won
