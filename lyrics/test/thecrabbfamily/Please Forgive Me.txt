My sleep is gone, my heart is full of sorrow
I can't believe how much I've let you down
I dread the pain that waits for me tomorrow
When the sun reveals my broken dreams scattered on the ground.

CHORUS
Please forgive me.  I need your grace to make it through
All I have is you.  I'm at your mercy
Lord, I will serve you, until my dying day
And help others find the way at your mercy
Please forgive me.

I can't believe that God of earth and glory
Would even take the time to care for no sinner boy like me.
But you know I've read in the bible, that old story
How he plead for mine and your forgiveness 
While he was dying on that old tree

CHORUS

Lord, please forgive me.  I need your grace to make it through
Lord, all I have is you.  I'm at your mercy
And Lord, I will serve you, until my dying day
And help others find the way at your mercy
Please forgive me

Lord, all I have is you.---Lyrics submitted by Zech.
