Lookin for answers
You need a way out
Youve been trapped in that trial
Full of sorrow and doubt

You saw a trickle of sunlight
But you found no escape
Just hold onto His promises
He said that Hed make a way

Hell make a way
In the middle of nowhere
When it seems no one really cares
Hes there by your side
Hell make a way
When you feel satan close in
Dont give up, dont give in
Hell make a way right on time

Standin at the Red Sea
No place to go
Pharaohs army was closin in
Theyd soon overthrow
But right out of nowhere
Came a mighty strong hand
He rolled back the waters
And made a way out again

Hell make a way
In the middle of nowhere
When it seems no one really cares
Hes there by your side
Hell make a way
When you feel satan close in
Dont give up, dont give in
Hell make a way right on time

Oh Hell make a way
In the middle of nowhere
When it seems no one really cares
Hes there by your side
Hell make a way
When you feel satan close in
Dont you give up, dont give in
Hell make a way right on time

Dont you give up, dont give in
Hell make a way right on time---Lyrics submitted by Shelley Hunt.
