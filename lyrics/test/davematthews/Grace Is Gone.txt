Neon shines through smokey eyes tonight
It's 2 AM I'm drunk again
It's heavy on my mind.

I could never love again 
So much as I love you
Where you end
Where I begin
Is like a river goin' through.

So take my eyes, take my heart
I need them no more
If never again they fall upon 
The one I so adore.

'Scuse me please
One more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think 
She broke my heart
My Grace is gone
One more drink and I'll move on...
Hmm Mmmm

One drink to remember
And another to forget 
How could I ever dream to find
Sweet love like you again?
One drink to remember
And another to forget. 

'Scuse me please
One more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think 
She broke my heart
My Grace is gone
One more drink and I'll move on...
One more drink and I'll be gone...

You think a thing's impossible
and the sun refuse to shine
When I woke beside you
Your cold hand lay in mine

'Scuse me please
One more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think 
She broke my heart
My Grace is gone
One more drink and I'll go

Scuse me please
One more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don't need to think 
She broke my heart
My Grace is gone
One more drink and I'll move on...
One more drink and I'll be gone...
One more drink my Grace is gone.---Lyrics submitted by Nanci.
