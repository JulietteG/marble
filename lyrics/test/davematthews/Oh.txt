The world is blowin' up
The world is cavin' in
The world has lost her way again
But you are here with me
But you are here with me
Makes it ok...

I hear you still talk to me
As if you're sittin' in that dusty chair
Makes the hours so much easier to bear
I know despite the years alone
I still hear you singin' to me that sweet song
And if it's all the same to you

I love you oh, so well 
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow
I love you oh, so well
Like to fill up Heaven overflowin'
Fill Heaven
Love you oh, so well

When it's cold and darkness falls
As if you're in the next room so alive
Could swear I hear you singin' to me

I love you oh, so well
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow
I love you oh, so well
Like to fill up Heaven overflowin'
Fill Heaven

The world is blowin' up
The world is cavin' in
The world has lost her way again
But you are here with me
But you are here with me
Makes it ok...

Ah, girl you're singin' to me still

I love you oh, so well
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow
I love you oh, so well
Have to fill up Heaven overflowin'
Fill Heaven---Lyrics submitted by Nanci.
