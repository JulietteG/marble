Confess your kiss still knocks me off my legs
The first time I saw you was like a pulse right through my chest
And I will forever cause you'll forever be
My one true broken heart pieces inside of me
And you forever my baby

You will rest your head, your strength want saving
And when you wake
You will fly away
Holding tight to the legs
Of all your angels
Goodbye my love
Into your blue, blue eyes
Your blue, blue
You're my baby blue

Confess I'm not quite ready to be left
Still I know I gave my level best
You give, you give to this I cannot tell
You made me, you made me, you and me forever, baby

You will rest your head, your strenth want saving
And when you wake you will fly away
Holding tight to the legs of all your angels
Goodbye my love into your blue, blue eyes
In your blue, blue, blue
You and me forever---Lyrics submitted by Diana.
