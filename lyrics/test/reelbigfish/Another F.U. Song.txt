Hey kids,it's time to use the F' word.
Fuuu...fuuu...fuuu...FUUUUCK
Living Fuck dying Fuck laughing Fuck crying Fuck this song, but mostly Fuck you!
Fuck love & hate & friends Fuck following trends Fuck this song can't wait 'till it ends!

(CHORUS)

Fuck everything, but Fuck you the most!
Fuck everyone, but Fuck you the most!
Wit' a big rusty pole or a splintery post!
Yeah Fuck you the most! Fuck YOU!

Fuck old school Fuck new school Fuck not cool Fuck too cool Fuck hip & ironically lame!
Fuck givin' advice Fuck tryin' to be nice Fuck you & you know who you are!

(CHORUS)

FUCK YOU!x9
FUCK YOOOUUU! FUCK YOOUU!
Fuck yeah! Fuck you!---Lyrics submitted by Kenny.
