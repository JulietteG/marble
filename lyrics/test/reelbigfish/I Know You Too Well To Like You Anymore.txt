I know you too well to like you anymore
I know you too well to like you anymore
There's a nightmare where my dream girl was
My prince charming is a bore
And I know you too well and I don't like you anymore

When we first started, even if you farted, I'd laugh and ask for more.
And in the beginning we always were grinning, we didn't know what we were smiling for.
We'd hold hands and then break dance, or rap like Dr. Dre.
And side by side, we'd drink all night, disgusting all our friends with our PDA.
You felt so good deep in my heart, and that's for sure.
But now I feel sick when I'm around you.
It hurts my head to think of how

I know you too well to like you anymore
I know you too well to like you anymore
I'm stuck with someone I can't stand
I can't stand you even more
And I know you too well and I don't like you anymore

I hate the way you always say you could find somebody else.
And you've got me on such a tight leash that I'm starting to strangle myself.
You criticize, I know that I'll never be what you want me to be.
When you used to be such a sight for sore eyes, but now looking at you is like a knife in me.
Your heart is filled with daggers
Your kiss is like razor blades
You'd rather stroke that champagne bottle
I'll toss you a hand grenade!

I know you too well to like you anymore
I know you too well to like you anymore
You're mean and you're unfriendly
Well you're an attention whore
And I know you too well and I don't like you

But I love you. Please stay.
No one makes me more miserable so please don't go away.
'Cause I need you always.
I'll never be able to forget you.
I wish that I had never met you!

How did this all get so ugly, you became so strange.
You're always coiled back, ready to attack. Your lips curled over your vampire fangs.
They say be careful what you wish for, it just might come your way.
Well, I dreamed about you baby, but now I'm dreaming of my escape.
I knew you were a bad idea, but I had to have you anyway.
Now of all my worst mistakes this one is hear to stay!

You're a son of a bitch, you know that?

I know you too well to like you anymore
I know you too well to like you anymore
There's a nightmare where my dream girl was
My prince charming is a bore
And I know you too well and I don't like you
I know you too well to like you anymore
I know you too well to like you anymore
I'm stuck with someone I can't stand
I can't stand you even more
And I know you too well and I don't like you

You're a slut
You're a dick
You're a whore
You're a prick
You make me fucking sick
You've got no tits
Well, you're a needle dick
I'm so sick of your shit
Well you're a hag
And you're a drag
You drive me fucking mad
Well I wish you'd go to hell
But I love you
Oh well... ---Lyrics submitted by Spencer.
