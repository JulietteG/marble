What a surprise, another pack of lies. Someone fill me in. So I can play the game. Is it fun to break a promise that was given with hope? Or am I the only one, who doesnt get the joke? Give me a sign. Buy me a clue. I want to be just like you.

Dont need no fly in the ointment. A monkey wrench in the gears. To add to my already stumbling day. Did I miss the appointment? Lose my place in the line? When they passed out the guide book explaining your plan 
to screw up my mind.

When questions arise Im sure you devised a stain glass window grin. To set the mind at ease. A vintage blend of guilt picked grapes in a broken cup. 
Just pass it around and pray theres enough. 
Dinner is paid. Toss me a bone. Im sure I can find my way home.

Dont need no fly in the ointment. A monkey wrench in the gears. To add to my already stumbling day. Did I miss the appointment? Lose my place in the line? When they passed out the guide book explaining your plan 
to screw up my mind.

Feeling under the weather a bit, and I sleep too long in the daylight.
Should I touch the third railing? Break all the rules? 
Or just, book me a passage on the ship of your fools. 
Get me a ticket. Sneak me aboard. Ill make a good sidekick 
for the rest of the hoard.

Dont need no fly in the ointment. A monkey wrench in the gears. To add to my already stumbling day. Did I miss the appointment? Lose my place in the line? When they passed out the guide book explaining your plan 
to screw up my mind.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
