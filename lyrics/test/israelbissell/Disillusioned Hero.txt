The clasped cloak stiff on the shoulders of the disillusioned hero. 
His bronze gaze, sea fixed, oblivious to shopping carts passing.

Battling elements from the sky and sea spray. 
Sprinklers cued by hourglass days. 
Times erosion etching deep amid a garden of winters sleep.

The basilisk roars from platform three with 
ticket in hand tour the tombstoned city. 
Safe return a guaranty from the disillusioned hero.
Too slow for moving to tired to care.

Soiled sheets for sails raised. High over cardboard ships. 
Creating waves for a journey beneath the sea. 
Waterland grave a welcome rest for a disillusioned hero.

Name weather from a marble stand. 
Forgotten warrior of the misguided land. 
Rust is your new armor. 

The piper plays a dirge of reliance for 
guiding fellow patriots of purge to the 
unblemished shores of the disillusioned hero. 
To slow for moving to tired to care.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
