The Screamer and David walked down the halls of landscapes, 
portraits, colors brightly swirled. 

Created by inspiration divine, or deranged 
mind of a tortured soul.

Now nailed to walls for the blurry eyed. Teary eyed lesser talents, 
to view and critique, pretending theyre an equal.

With a scream, the fig leaf flew, exposing David for all to view 
and give fruitless hope to find flaw in perfection.

Brush strikes retreating, colors all bleeding. Brightness turned to shady. Placing a smile on a lady hanging, lonely on the wall.

The Screamer and David returned to their floors awaiting opening doors. 
Let those of the new age try their hand at creating a lasting impression.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
