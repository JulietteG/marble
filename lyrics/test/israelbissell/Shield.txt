I am your shield sword slashed battle worn 
forged by loves pledge sworn.
A barricade of strength when you are weakened.

The warriors of youth, untested in conflict, sit in their false armored courage.
It is the grey willing to protect. It is the dust tarnished friend who deflects the blows and arrows of enemies.

In case of emergency break the glass of your museum display. 
The battle horn blows against mighty foes as false hearted few 
hide in the shadows.

Stand tall on your rampart. Raise high the banner. It has a right to fly or the fortress. My bright shine has faded, rivets have loosened but hard hearted I stand, proud by your side.

I am your shield though aged still prepared to stand before you. 
The battle axe pounds the bolts from bows dent though stung 
I remain unyielding.

Young warriors flee, I drop to my knee showing all that youre not alone.
Not stormed a queen unrealized. It is my duty, sworn in past ages 
that none shall breach your defenses.

I am your shield, chipped and dull finished. Age is my weapon. 
Love is your talisman. Defeat not an option. 
Let me, take the blows.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
