Those who know, do not talk. For talkers do not know. 
Stop you senses, close the doors. Let sharp things be blunted, 
tangles absorbed. 

The light tempered and turmoil subdued, 
for this is the mystic unity in which the wise men move.

Neither by affection, Nor by estrangement. 
Or profit, loss, honor or shame.
It is hard to achieve what is easy, i
n the light is the key that unlocks the chain.

Take it slow, stop your thinking, focus on nothing 
and nothing will prove. That this is the mystic unity, 
in which the wise men move.

For all the world, the one held highest 
is the one who quests the clear lights flame.---Lyrics submitted by Chuck.
