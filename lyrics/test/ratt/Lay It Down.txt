I know you don't really know me
I know you don't really care to see me
I'm into total affection
Not bein' scared if you never please me

You know you really want to lay it down
Right now and how?
I know you really want to lay it down
Right now, lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down

Under the sheets you will find me
I know that nothin's for free
You take what's good for your pleasin'
I'll take what's good for the crazy evenin'

You know you really want to lay it down
Right now and how?
I know you really want to lay it down
Right now, lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down

Right now you only want romance
I'll give you all that I can
If you give me just one chance
To prove myself in love

Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
Lay it down---Lyrics submitted by Randall Bates.
