Listen to me
There's only one thing
You cannot see
Everytime you talk

Millions of things
There only one
You cannot see
Everytime you talk
You can stop the clocks forever

Listen to what I said
Stop the clocks for you and me
Listen to me again
Stop the clocks forever

Listen to me
There's only one thing
You cannot see
Everytime you talk

Millions of things
Could only but changes everything
Everytime you talk
You can stop the clocks forever

Listen to what I said
Stop the clocks for you and me
Listen to me again
Stop the clocks forever
Stop the clocks forever

Everything happens too fast
Now it's a part of the past
Everything changes so fast

Stop the clocks forever
Stop the clocks for you and me
Stop the clocks forever
Stop the clocks---
