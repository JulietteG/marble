Are we, are we just selfish
wanting to keep you where we are,
just where you left us.
you're seeing all the things i'd die to see.

Everybody finds it necessary to say how much you loved me,
as if i didn't know so deeply.

can you see evidence of perfection, evidence of perfection?
look past the circumstance
and find some meaning, find some meaning.

if only this song could capture
the peace you are seeing,
if only this song could capture
the hope we are seeking.

everybody finds it necessary to say how much you loved me,
as if i didn't know so deeply.

can you see evidence of perfection, evidence of perfection?
look past the circumstance and find some meaning,
find some meaning. (repeat 2x)

Just let me,
and let me sleep.
(repeat 3x)---Lyrics submitted by Danielle.
