My mind isn't quite sure
What it has bargained for
But my heart is time with
With the consistent beat

This dream
Is sneaking up on me
No matter how collected
I seem to be
Is anybody ever truly complete?
Or are the better ones
Just better at believing?

So I'll go and say you're with me
I know it's just the beginning

My mind isn't quite sure
What it has bargained for
But my heart is time with
With the consistent beat

At times
I feel cold and exposed
Under a microscope
But it has never felt much better to live
It doesn't matter if all my friends
Latch onto this
There's only one acceptance
That's not later dismissed

Just go and say you're with me
I know it's just the beginning

My mind isn't quite sure
What it has bargained for
But my heart is time with
With the consistent beat of yours

My mind isn't quite sure
What it has bargained for
But my heart is time with
With the consistent beat of yours

I'm not looking to music to complete me
I'm not looking for a new philosophy
I'm not waiting for somebody to swoon me
I'm not waiting to somebody to swoon me
I'm just searching for a better way
Into your love

My mind isn't quite sure
What it has bargained for
But my heart is time with
With the consistent beat of yours

My mind isn't quite sure
What it has bargained for
But my heart is time with
With the consistent beat

Can you feel
The only eyes that see inside?
Can you feel
Anything anymore?---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
