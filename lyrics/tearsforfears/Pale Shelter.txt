How can I be sure?
When your intrusion's my illusion
How can I be sure?
When all the time you change my mind
I ask for more and more,
How can I be sure?

When you don't give me love
You give me pale shelter
You don't give me love
You give me cold hands
And I can't operate on
This failure
When all I want to be is
Completely in command

How can I be sure?
for all you say you keep me waiting
How can I be sure 
When all you do is see me through? 
I ask for more and more
How can I be sure
When you don't give me love
You give me pale shelter
You don't give me love 
You give me cold hands
And I can't operate on
This failure
When all I want to be is
Completely in command

I've been here before
There is no why, no need 
to try
I thought you had it all
I'm calling you
I'm calling you
I ask for more and more
(ask for more and more)
How can I be sure
(How can I be sure)

When you don't give me love
You give me pale shelter
You don't give me love,
You give me cold hands
And I can't operate in 
This failure
When all I want to be is
Completely in command
Completely in command

You don't give me love
You don't give me love
You don't give me love
You don't give me love
You don't give me love
You don't give me love---Lyrics submitted by Eiranna.
