There's only need
I love your need
So much I'm losing me

I cannot see the reason for the pain
With hungry joy
I'll be your toy
Just hoping you will play
Without the hope my body starts to fail

Memories fade but the scars still linger
Goodbye my friend
Will I ever love again
Memories fade but the scars still linger

I cannot grow
I cannot move 
I cannot feel my age
The vice like grip of tension
Holds me fast

Engulfed by you
What can I do
When history's my cage
Look forward to a future in the past

Memories fade but the scars still linger
Goodbye my friend
Will I ever love again
Memories face but the scars still linger

The more I talk
The more I say
The less you seem to hear
I'm speechless in a most peculiar way

Your mind is weak
Your need is great
And nothing is too clear
For you to use to take the pain away

Memories fade but the scars still linger
Goodbye my friend
Will I ever love again 

Memories fade
No don't pretend you can justify the end

Memories fade but the scars still linger
Still linger..
Still linger..---Lyrics submitted by Eiranna.
