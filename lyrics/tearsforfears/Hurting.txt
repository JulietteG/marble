Is it an horrific dream
Am I sinking fast
Could a person be so mean 
As to laugh and laugh
On my own
Could you ease my load
Could you see my pain
Could you please explain 
The hurting

Could you understand a child
When he's cries in pain
Could you give him all the needs
Or do you feel the same
All along
You've been told  you've wrong
When you felt it right
And you've left to fight
The hurting

Get in line with the things you know
Feel the pain
Feel the sorrow
Touch the hurt and don't let go
Don't let go
Don't let go

Get in line with the things you know
Learn to cry
Like a baby
Then the hurting won't come back
Won't come back
Won't come back

Is it an horrific dream
Is it an horrific dream
Is it an horrific dream
Is it an horrific dream
Is it an horrific dream
Is it an horrific dream---Lyrics submitted by Eiranna.
