Took a long time to mend
Took a long time to make amends
Funny how the story goes
Strip a man bare and burn his clothes 

Time is all I crave
It comes in waves
I will be here until I drown

System's on overload
Goes to bed warm but wakes up cold
What a bloody cross to bare
Time on my hands but I don't care

Days are all the same
They wax and wane
I will be here until I drown

Time is all I crave
It comes in waves
I will be here until I drown  

Days are all the same
They wax and wane
I will be here until I drown

Time is all I crave
It comes in waves
Will be here until I drown---Lyrics submitted by Eiranna.
