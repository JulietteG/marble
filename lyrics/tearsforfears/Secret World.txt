This is the garden
This is the steeple
I hear the crowd before I ever see the people

Yours for the asking
And for the taking
There is a power in the vacuum we are making

You and I have a secret world
And we can keep it unfurled
And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave

And when were crossed
We can say that were lost
In the middle of nowhere (think youll like it or not)
And if were wrong
And we end up alone
Well light a candle for their innocent bones

You and I have a secret world
And we can keep it unfurled
And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave.  yeah

Someones knocking at the door
Somebodys ringing the bell
Someones knocking at the door
Somebody ringing the bell.



You and I have a secret world
And we can keep it unfurled 
And pay no attention

And when were crossed
We can say that were lost
In the middle of nowhere ..think youll like it or not
And if were wrong
And we end up alone
Well light a candle for their innocent bones


You and I have a secret world
And we can keep it unfurled
And pay no attention to the cradle or the grave

(guitar solo)

And when were crossed
We can say that were lost
In the middle of nowhere .. think youll like it or not
And if were wrong
When we end up alone
Well light a candle for their innocent bones

And when were crossed
We can say that were lost
In the middle of nowhere.. think youll like it or not
And if were wrong (gone?)
And we end up alone
Well light a candle for their innocent bones
