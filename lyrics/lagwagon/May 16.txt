No more waiting on them
And you rise inside new rooms
It's offical you've gone
you can live for no one else
Man the guilt must be huge
There's no gain in failure you succeed at being mine
Yeah, old friend, see you there I will be proud from afar
I can paint a picture in a moment of memories and there aren't many left
I am extradited, uninvited

It's just another saturday

Take a step to freedom
You and her loathing this cruel world
Take a breath of shelter and exhale
Trust and allegiance
Liberate yourself from hell

It's just another saturday---Lyrics submitted by Francine.
