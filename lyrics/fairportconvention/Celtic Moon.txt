There's a lady who carries a burden
And the lines on her face tell it all;
She remembers hearing sad stories
But still dances at Memory Hall.

And the stars would come out just to see her
And the clouds blew away all too soon,
Her face lit the heavens above her:
She was helped by the Celtic Moon

[The] Celtic Moon
[The] Celtic Moon

Once a young girl with rings on her fingers
Given to her by a boy she once loved.
Barefoot they sat by the river
Sharing secrets with God up above.

And the stars would come out just to see her
And the clouds blew away all too soon,
Her face lit the heavens above her:
She was helped by the Celtic Moon.

[The] Celtic Moon
[The] Celtic Moon
[The] Celtic Moon
[The] Celtic Moon

(instrumental jig)

On a cold night by the roadside she rested,
[And] Pale was her skin, tired and worn,
Her beauty had faded through [from] grieving,
She was too tired to weep, too tired to mourn;

And the stars would come out just to see her
And the clouds blew away all too soon,
Her face lit the heavens above her
[She was] Helped by the Celtic Moon.

[The] Celtic Moon
[The] Celtic Moon
[The] Celtic Moon
[The] Celtic Moon
