Shepherds gaze in wonder
While angel voices sing.
The night of nights has come
And brought the world
The long-awaited King.
The earth is filled with gladness
And yet the heavens weep.
For heaven's eyes can see
He was born to die for me.

Jesus, baby Jesus,
Is that a tear in Your eye?
Jesus, sweet baby Jesus,
You must know
That You were born to die.

It must have broken God's heart
For the future He could see.
Yet He formed the hands
And feet knowing one day
They'd be nailed to a tree.
So all the world could know Him,
A gift came from above.
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son.

Jesus, baby Jesus,
With a tear of love in Your eye.
Jesus, sweet baby Jesus,
You knew You were born to die.

So, Jesus, thank You, Jesus,
For Your gift of eternal life.
My Jesus, Jesus,
'Cause for me You were born to die.---Lyrics submitted by Cassie.
