He molded and built a small lonely hill
That he knew would be called calvary.
Then he made the seed that would grow to be
Thorns that would make his son bleed.
Then he made a green stem
Gave it leaves and then gave it sunshine and rain and
Sheltered it with moss.
He grew the tree he knew would be
Used to make the old rugged cross.

Ii
With tears in his eyes god looked down through time
Saw him spat upon rejected and mocked.
Still he knew the tree he knew would be
Used to make the old rugged cross.
Chorus

Nothing took his life with love he gave it.
He was crucified on a tree that he created.
With great love for man
God gave with his plan.
He grew the tree so that we might go free.

(ending)
Still he grew the tree he knew would be
Used to make the old rugged cross. ---Lyrics submitted by Sandi Edwards Godfrey.
