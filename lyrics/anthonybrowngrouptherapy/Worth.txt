You thought I was worth saving
So you came in changed my life

You thought I was worth keeping
so you cleaned me up inside

You thought I was to die for
so you sacrificed your life

So I could be free
So I could be whole
So I could tell everyone I know

Hallelujah
Glory to God who changed my life
Forever

Because I am free
Because I am whole
And I will tell everyone I know

You thought I was worth saving
So you came in changed my life

You thought I worth keeping
So you cleaned me up inside
You thought I was to die for
You sacrificed your life
So I can be free
End---
