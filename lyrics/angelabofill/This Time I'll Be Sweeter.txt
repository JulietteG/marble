Darling can't you see
What losing you has done to me
I'm not the same girl I used to be

Have a change of heart
Don't leave me standing in the dark
Don't let confusion keep us apart

Come back to me, And I'll guarantee
All the tenderness and love you'll ever need

This time I'll be sweeter
Our love will run deeper
I won't mess around, I won't let you down
Have faith in me...have faith in me

Since you've been away
I haven't seen the light of day
I'm lost without you, can't find my way

So won't you please be fair
And let me show how much I care
Say you'll be mine, and answer my prayer

Come back to me, and I promise I'll be
Everything that's bright, a knew your whole life through

This time I'll be sweeter
Our love will run deeper
I won't mess around, I won't let you down
Have faith in me...have faith in me

This time I'll be sweeter
Our love will run deeper
I won't mess around, I won't let you down
Have faith in me...have faith in me---Lyrics submitted by Andre Henry.
