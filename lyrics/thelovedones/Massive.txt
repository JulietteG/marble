Give me your heart, give me your head... or I'll keep coming back
give me your hair, give me your skin... or I'll keep coming back
I'll take your friends I'll take your kids... I'll keep coming back
I'll take away all your reasons to live... I'll keep coming back

what's the sense in praying when you already know the truth?
i'll keep coming back

I've taken your legs, I've taken your
spine... and I'll keep coming back
I've soaked up your blood, devoured your
eyes... and I'll keep coming back
you think you've got years, you think
you've got time? I won't hesitate
to take it away, no reason or rhyme... I'll keep coming back 

what's the sense in praying when you already know the truth?
you're disintegrating... it's heartbreaking
proof that I'll keep coming back

it keeps coming back, I guess we should
fight. we'll start fighting back
the irony is it can't take you alive... please start fighting back
I know you're scared, just take my hand...
we'll start fighting back
it keeps coming back, can't take you alive, just
take my hand, we'll keep fighting back

my knees are cut from praying to a god I don't even know
my soul ain't worth saving but if you're
there you won't let her go
we'll keep on fighting back---Lyrics submitted by Tony Bown.
