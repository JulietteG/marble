People stay together forever
In the light of a meaning, too
But no one does, 'I do' like we do
Fireworks fade and the fireflies
Once the honeymoon's through
They don't do 'I do' like we do

Nobody got a you like me
Nobody got this history
Of the good times, and the hard times
And the wild times they've been through
Nobody got a me like you
And I ain't much but this much is true
No one does 'I do' like we do

I tried to keep you guessin'
And you still got me confused
No one does 'I do' like we do
Everybody turns out the light, oh
The day is through
No one does 'I do' like we do

Nobody got a you like me
Nobody got this history
Of the good times, and the hard times
And the wild times they've been through
Nobody got a me like you
And I ain't much but this much is true
No one does 'I do' like we do

I ain't knockin' what the others got
Cuz they a good thing, too
But they don't do 'I do' like we do
Ramblin' down this same ol' road
We'll find our 'something new'
And no one does 'I do' like we do, yeah

Nobody got a you like me
Nobody got this history
Of the good times, and the hard times
And the wild times they've been through
Nobody got a me like you
And I ain't much but this much is true
No one does 'I do' like we do

No one does 'I do' like we do
No one does 'I do' like we do
No one does (no one does), no one does
No one does (no one does), no one does
No one does (no one does), no one does
(No one does) yea, yeah
No one does (no one does), no one does---
