Suddenly it appeared a week ago
A bold arrangement of cells
The cheeto loogies had attracted worms
And all my horses sat in hell

What about the gate with cheese made of cough phlegm?
What about the faces in the rain?
What about the people on that train that night?
What about this feeling I have pain?

The deal's in the flap on that thing of mine             
The deal's in the flap on my thing                                             X2

The mites on trigger's face had killed a cop
Our cat had flown to Abilene
The flakes on station three had failed the test
The tiny one was free

What about the trip that day to the grocery store?
What about the lipstick on the dog?
What about the retard on the bridge that night?
What about the headlights in the fog?

The deal's in the flap on that thing of mine             
The deal's in the flap on my thing                                             X2

Though I'm never gonna find the winner,
Am I ever gonna feel no better sometime?

Am I ever gonna be together?
Maybe somebody will change the weather
Until then just lonely pictures sitting in the back of my head

It took the sun about a week ago
The children had to run and hide
The spider-dogs had warned us that
The tiny one had lied

What about the fifteen negro cheerleaders?
What about a neosporin bib?
What about the tiny one encased in ice?
What about the lies we have to live?

The deal's in the flap on that thing of mine             
The deal's in the flap on my thing                                              X2

And so the moral of this story is
Never cross an angel with an asp
Never treat the shiny one to ice cream cones
Never pinch a sweaty mean cop's ass---Lyrics submitted by Lyall Erasmus.
