Reverend, reverend
Is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins
An image beneath me

Lost within my plans for life
It all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world
Left in my misery

The reverend, he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
It's nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why

I will remember
The love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see now is your (face)

Well, I guess you took my youth
And gave it all away
Like the birth of a new found joy
This love would end in rage

And when she died
I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul

You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories now unfold

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound

I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Let me set my soul free
Unto to me at last

Through all those complexed years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own

And when she died
I should've cried and spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery... gates

(Solo)

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates
Gates
