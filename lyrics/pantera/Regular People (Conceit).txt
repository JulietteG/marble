I've trampled on that road
That you think you own
You have that "smart ass" attitude
It's time to stop the fiction

I live it every day
While you're mind's far away
I'm out here putting pride on the line
And you case on me with pure respect
One chance at one thing
Hard time is coming
My time, your pain
I reign on you
You think you own
I take away
Take it with me
You think you own
I took away
Made it my own

Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this

The so many times
You practice in your mirror
To be just like me
But you just can't see
You ain't got the balls, son

I fight for love of brother
Your friends fight one another
You can't see because your head's up your ass
And just in cast you think you're bad
I crush your rush
I rule YOU fool
I'm immovable stone in your world of weak -- I speak---
