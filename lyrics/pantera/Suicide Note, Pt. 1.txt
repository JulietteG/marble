Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale, the pills that kill and take
the pain away
Diet of life, shelter without, the face that cannot
see inside yours and mine

Pre-chorus:
When I'm hiding, when I need it, it lets me
breathe, for our handle on this life, I don't believe
this time

Chorus:
Would you look at me now?
Can you tell I'm a man?
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
Try to die again, try to live through this night
Try to die again.....

Forever fooling, free and using, sliding down the slide that breaks a will
Mothers angel, getting smarter, how smart are
you to regress unfulfilled? It's a damn shame, but who's to blame?

Pre-chorus
