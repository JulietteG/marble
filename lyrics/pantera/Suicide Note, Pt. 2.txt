out of my mind, gun up to the mouth
no pretension execution live and learn
rape and turn

Fret not family nor pre-judged army
this is for me and me only cowards only
try it

Dont you try to die, like me
its livid and its lies
makes graves 
decending

Its not worth the time to try
to replenish a rotting life
i'll end the problem, facing nothing 
fuck you off, fuck you all

Tortured history
addict of misery
this exposes me 
for weakness is a magnet
wach me do it
do it

Dont you try to die,like me
its livid and its lies
makes graves 
decending
DOWN

Why would you help anyone who
dosent want it doesnt need it
doesnt want your shit advice
when a mind's made up to go ahead
and die
Whats done is done and gone
so why cry

tortured history
addict of misery
this exposes me
for weakness is a magnet
watch me do it
do it do it

Dont you try to die,like me
its livid and its lies
makes graves 
DECENDING DOWN---Lyrics submitted by dalton.
