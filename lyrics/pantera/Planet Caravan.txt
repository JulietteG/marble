we sail through endless skies
stars shine like eyes
the black night sighs
the moon in sync like trees
falls down in leaves
light up the night
the earth a purple place
of sapphire haze below them aways
while down below the trees
gale gentle breeze
silver starlight
rains down from high
in soul we pass on by
the quills of night
of grave gone by
as we travel the universe---Lyrics submitted by liza.
