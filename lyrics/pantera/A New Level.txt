Now a new look in my eyes my spirit rise
Forget the past
Present tense works and lasts
Got shit on
Pissed on
Spit on
Stepped on
Fucked with
Pointed at by lesser men

New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials

A new level of confidence and power

Demanding plea for unity between us all --
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar
Power
Impatient
Because time is shorter

A new level of confidence and power

No fucking surrender
Can't lose
Life kills---
