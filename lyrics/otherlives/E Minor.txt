I forgot something of younger days
When there were no cares
And clouds appear lit that
Made me ask how their
Lives could have been spent

Carelessly wasting our day
Inquires of what is the way
With no reply

And when you were young
There's a lightness surrounds you
The world turns
When you take back 
All the things that you've earned
You found nothing at all

Carelessly wasting our day
Inquires of what is the way
With no reply

Where did it go now
All that you thought was well defined
It's all but become just
A passing thought in spite

Don't let it go now
Our lives could be much more than this
Let go and find it---Lyrics submitted by John.
