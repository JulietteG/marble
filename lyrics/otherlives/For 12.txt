Oh I was in the dark age,
Searching for the ones in my mind.

But I had hit the ground runnin.
Steady as you go. I dont mind.

Im still here today.

Spouting hymns and buzzing rhymes,
And forever talking when it aint so kind.

But it feels like forever on the run.
When your mind turns to fiction.

I had took the long way.
I was in the heat. I dont mind

Im so far away.

But it feels like forever on the run.
When your mind turns to fiction.

Oh, nudging the ghost from the skull.
And a night without sleep.
Vibration comes,
First to the head and last to the feet.
Spouting hymns and buzzing rhymes,
And forever talking when it aint so kind.

But it feels like forever on the run.
When your mind turns to fiction.

Instrumental
