I wear my sunglasses at night
 So I can, So I can
 Watch you weave then breathe your story lines
 And I wear my sunglasses at night
 So I can, So I can
 Keep track of the visions in my eyes

 While, she's deceiving me, 
 It cuts my security (has)
 she got control of me
 I turn to her and say

 Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades; oh no
 Don't masquerade with the guy in shades;
 (oh no) (I can't believe it)
 You got it made with the guy in shades; oh no

 I wear my sunglasses at night
 So I can, So I can
 Forget my name while you collect your claim
 And I wear my sunglasses at night
 So I can, So I can
 See the light that's right before my eyes

 While she's deceiving me, 
 she cuts my security (has)
 She got control of me
 I turn to her and say

 Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades (oh no)
 Don't masquerade with the guy in shades
 (oh no) (I can't believe it)
 (cuz) You got it made with the guy in shades (oh no)

 While she's deceiving me, 
 she cuts my security (has)
 She got control of me
 I turn to her and say

 Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades (oh no)
 Don't masquerade with the guy in shades
 (oh no) (I can't believe it)
 don't be afraid of the guy in shades
 (oh No) (It can't escape you)
 (cus) You got it made with the guy in shades (oh no)

 I said
 I wear my sunglasses at night
 I wear my sunglasses at night
 I wear my sunglasses at night

 I say to ya now
 I wear my sunglasses at night
 I wear my sunglasses at night
 I wear my sunglasses at night

 I cry to you
 I wear my sunglasses at night
 I wear my sunglasses at night---Lyrics submitted by Delainey Conger.
