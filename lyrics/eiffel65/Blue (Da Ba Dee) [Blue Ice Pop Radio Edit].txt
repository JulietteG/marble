Im blue 
im in need of a guy (x7)

Yo listen up
Heres the story about a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue like him
Indside and outside
Blue his house with a blue little window and a blue corvette
And everything is blue for him and his-self
And everybody around cuz he aint got nobody to listen.

Im blue 
im in need of a guy (x7)

Im blue 
im in need of a guy (x7)

I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the color I thought that i'd wear
Blue are the streets and all the trees are too
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my corvette its standing outside
Blue are the words are I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me.

Im blue
im in need of a guy (x7)

Indside and outside
Blue his house with the blue little window and a blue corvette
And everything is blue for him and his-self
And everybody around cuz he aint got nobody to listen.

Im blue 
im in need of a guy (x7)
