Yo, listen up heres the story about a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue like him, inside and outside
Blue his house with a blue little window and a blue corvette and everything is blue for him
and hisself and everybody around
Cause he aint got nobody to listen

Chorus:
Im blue, I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die 
I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die 
I will bleed I will die

Im blue, I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die
I will bleed I will die

Verse 2
I have a blue house with a blue window
Blue is the color of all that I wear 
Blue are the streets and all the trees are blue
I have a girlfriend and she is so blue
Blue are the people here that walk around
Blue like my corvette its sitting outside
Blue are the words I say and what I think
Blue are the feelings that live inside me

Chorus
