overwhelmed with calculations
how much time i've truly wasted
spend it all anticipating
'til my blackened heart is faded
now i know how far I'd take it
now i know how far I'll take it
won't be lost in conversations,
headiness or accusations
now i know
now i know

It's far away from here
I file it down do anything
anywhere but here
burn it down and disappear
far away from here

I'm not fighting any longer 
nothing left for me to conquer
but my tired soul's on fire
if i don't move I'll surely die here
now i know
now i know

it's far away from here
i file it down do anything
anywhere but here
just far far away from here
won't you tell me dear
it's far far away from here
far away from here
now I know
the whole world could disappear
disappear

I'm not looking for approval
just the strength to finally move on
if i don't move I'm surely doomed 
and I'm the only one I'm foolin'

it's far away from here
file it down do anything
anywhere but here
just far far away from here
far away from here
burn it down and disappear
anywhere but here
just far far away from here
far away from here
file it down do anything
won't you tell me dear
it's far far away from here
it's far away from here---Lyrics submitted by Dick Johnson.
