I still care about Christian
Does he care about me?
When I see him around he looks down,
afraid of what hell see

And I know theres a heaven
that hes trying to find
But its hell that he makes, callous and afraid
of the ones hes left behind

And the touch of his body, so tender and cruel,
when he made me play girlfriend,
there wasnt much I could do

Hed come to my garret,
and wed make something like love
But the flowers he gave me have wilted,
but I keep them, like I keep him

He wants a life after life
But the world he didnt love,
and the one he didnt love
should have been

Night after night
But the world he didnt love,
and the one he didnt love
will never know
paradise

When he makes his confessions,
when he says his prayers
and kneels beside his bed in the moonlight,
is a part of me there?

Hes taken up with a new girl,
who keeps his conscience clean,
and tells him hes a keeper,
though I dont know if he knows what that means---
