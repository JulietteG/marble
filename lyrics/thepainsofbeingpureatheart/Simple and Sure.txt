Outside theres a man who cant make up his mind
looking for something he may never

And hes got a girl with blisters, who tries to understand
shes in love with a complicated man

But I never found it so hard
No I never was so confused
Cuz I never found anyone so absolutely right
as I found in you

It might seem simple but Im sure
I just want to be yours
It wont be easy but I know
I simply want to be yours

I know we live in complicated times
and its so difficult to decide
who should be our king and how low we should bow
to lick the boots of a sacred cow

I just want to be yours---
