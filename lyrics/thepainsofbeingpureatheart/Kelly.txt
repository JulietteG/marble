Hunt me with your blackened eyes,
would you run to the end of the world?
Tell me how you cant be kind,
would you run to the end of the world?

Cuz I know youre violent, and I know youre true,
and theres a thousand lives youd like to try
but never do
But if you come with me, we could find just two

Kelly tell me all you like
If its filthy films and swill I think we just might

Kelly tell me all youd live without
If its quotes as jokes and coke
we should hang around

Passed out on the train again,
woke up at the end of the world
So youre a lush with a healthy mistrust
of any man who says you must

be someones baby, or nobody at all,
with a thousand lives so circumscribed
theyre not lives at all
but if you come with me, we could lose them all

Tell me everything---
