See this ain't nothing that you use to
Out of the ordinary unusual
You gotta have the mind state like I'm so great
Can't nobody do it like you do
Miraculous, phenomenal and ain't nobody in here stopping you
Show no love cause you what's up
Look at ya self in the mirror like what the fuck

Damn I look good and cant nobody freak it like I could
Yea OK I got a little fat but
My shorty told me that he like it like that
I'm happy
Another nigga never can't be
I'm so outstanding
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sitting on top of the world like brandy

See I look to good for this necklace
And I look to good to be wearing this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look to good to be driving that
And I look to good to be buying that
You know I look way to good to be trying that
I'm conceited I got a reason

Now who's that peaking in my window
Nobody cause I live in a penthouse
Baby I'm sorry but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, lets see
This kid that I'm waiting on
He said he loves when my jeans look painted on
Wit a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always getting hated on
Now shorty tryna push up on me like a wonder bra
Listen when I speak out I wouldn't want you take it wrong
Now number one I don't need you
Ya names Q I only see you wen I see you
Listen two you never play me
Why is that?? why is that??
Cause I'm such a fucking lady
And three is all about me I don't want to talk about it
If you'd like to hear it here it go
Here you go I wrote a song about it

See I look to good to be fucking you
And I look to good to be loving you
You know I look way to good to stuck with you
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look too good to be getting with
And I look to good to be having kids
You know I look way to good to be in the crib
I'm conceited I got a reason

I don't know what I'm doing
I cant stop my body from moving
I'm bopping and poppin to the music
He's watching me and he's bout to lose it
I'm dropping that hotter den drop it like its hot
Face down ass up, on some new shit
I'm out of control wit it
Dip it low pick it up slow poke it out now roll wit it
My thong showing but its cool my shoes go wit it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it
See I look good and I'm knowing it
But I was never to proud to be showing it

See I look to good for this necklace
And I look to good to be wearing this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look to good to be driving that
And I look to good to be buying that
You know I look way to good to be trying that
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look to good to be fucking you
And I look to good to be loving you
You know I look way to good to stuck with you
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look too good to be getting with
And I look to good to be having kids
You know I look way to good to be in the crib
I'm conceited I got a reason---Lyrics submitted by Neya Seignious.
