Kiss Kiss Kill Kill

ooooooooooooooohhhhhh
In this shiver of symphony
the closing shadows turn like a still
a thousand feet across the floor
and in a second I'll never grow old
quiet now quiet now
crying I won't stop
the quivers running down my mind
A-a-a-a-a-o-o-o
close enough
close enough
and I'm feeling tired

(kiss kiss kill kill)
(kiss kiss kill kill)

Kiss kiss kiss me dantly
kill kill kill me quietly
chill chill chill me instantly
one kill one chill just one kiss

In this scaring demised time cries and grabs for reality
having co touch comforts me as a greeting in dead and despair
sinking down sinking down slipping my conscious knows hasn't into the pride
close and I'm close and I'm feeling tired

(kiss kiss kill kill)
(kiss kiss kill kill)

Kiss kiss kiss me dantly
kill kill kill me quietly
chill chill chill me instantly
one kill one chill just one kiss

Kiss kiss kiss me dantly
kill kill kill me quietly
chill chill chill me instantly
kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss

ooooooooooooooooooo

Kiss kiss kiss me dantly
kill kill kill me quietly
chill chill chill me instantly
one kill one chill just one kiss

Kiss kiss kill kill
kiss kiss kill kill
kiss kiss kill kill
kiss kiss---Lyrics submitted by Miriam.
