I know thats just the way it goes
and you aint right, for sure
You turned your back on love for the last time
It wont take much longer now
time makes me stronger
well, theres nothing more to say

One day in your life
said love will remind you
how could you leave it all behind
One day in your life
its gonna find you
with the tears you left me cry
and maybe Im stronger than before
you gotta play it on the lie
Maybe one day in your life

My love, did you think Id break down and cry
This thing we had it meant the world to me
guess I was blind
It wont take much longer now
see time makes me stronger, well
and I know youll be coming round some day

One day in your life
said love will remind you
how could you leave it all behind
One day in your life
its gonna find you
with the tears you left me cry
and maybe Im stronger than before
you gotta lay it on the lie
Maybe one day in your life

(Bridge:)
You call me in the midnight hour
with your velvet lies
so many sleepless nights
I wonder, is it time to say goodbye?

One day in your life
say love will remind you
how could you leave it all behind
(Could you leave it all behind?)
One day in your life
its gonna find you
with the tears you left me cry
and maybe Im stronger than before
you gotta play it on the lie
Maybe one day in your life

One day

One day in your life
say love will remind you
how could you leave it all behind
(how could you leave it all behind?)
One day in your life
is gonna find you
with the tears you left me cry
and maybe Im stronger than before
you gotta play it on the lie---Lyrics submitted by Anna Svensson.
