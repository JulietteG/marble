I've been thinking about it
Give some serious thought
And I made up my mind
And I have decided that I need a little more time to decide

We used to be happy
Loving being in love
But lately I came to find
That everyday there's something new about you that I just don't like

So now I'm, 

Absolutly positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you
Uh Uh
Anymore
Say Baby Baby I'm, 
Absolutle Positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you yeah
Anymore yeah

Now I can't deny
There'some feelings for you inside me
That's why I'm having the hardest time
Trying to just up and leave
But every time that you smile in my face
While lying to me
Packing my things and getting outta here
Suddenly seems so easy

So now I'm

Absolutly positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you
Yeah Yeah
Say Baby Baby Baby I'm

Absolutly positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you anymore

I been racking my brain over you baby
Trying to figure out just what to do
Don't think I love you anymore

Don't think I love you
Don't think I love you anymore

Absolutly positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you anymore

I'm absolutly positively
Certain that I'm not sure that I love you anymore
