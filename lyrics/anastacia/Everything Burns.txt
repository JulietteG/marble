she sits in her corner
singin herself to sleep
wrappted all of the promises 
that no one seems to keep
she no longer crys to herself
no tears left to wash away
just diary of empty pages 
feelings gone astray
and she will sing

till everything burns
while everyone screams
burning their lives 
burning my dreams
all of this faith
and all of this pain
burning all down
is my anger reigns
till everything burns

walking trough life unnoticed
nowing that no one cares
too consumed in their masquerade
no one sees her there
and still she sings

till everything burns 
while everyone screams
burning their lives
burning my dream 
and all of this faith
and all of this pain
burning all down
is my anger eigns
till everything

everything burns(everything will burn)
everything burns(watching it all faith away)
(all faith away)everyone scream
everyone scream(uwohhhhooooh)
everything burns everyone scream
burning their lives 
(burning my dreams)
and all of this faith 
(and all of this pain)
burning all down
is my anger eigns
ti everything burns(oooooooh)
everything burns (watching it all faith away)
(ooooooooooh)everything burns
(watching it al faited awaaaaaaaay(aaaay).---Lyrics submitted by agata.
