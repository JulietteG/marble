So baby when you looked at me
Yeah my world changed completely
You are the best thing that is on my mind
So baby its not hard to see
That I fell in love so completely
You are the best thing that I have in my life

(Corus)
I got the time, I got the place, I got this hurt for you
And this moment dont you feel it baby
I know that its gonna be the same way for me
So I say to you
Baby lets drive away
And leave this place not for 1 day
So baby lets move tonight
Its the 1st day of the rest of our lives
Yeah I just want to run away
Turn my back erase all this pain now
Wouldnt it just be nice to drive away
Start again every time

So baby we were meant to be
I can see when were together
You are the only one, the only one for me
You know it
So baby when you take my hand
We are on this road to forever
Youre the best thing that I have in my life

Corus repeat

So baby lets drive away
Leave this place not for 1 day
So baby lets move tonight

So baby lets drive away
Leave this place not for 1 day
So baby lets move tonight
Its the 1st day of the rest of our lives
Yeah I just want to run away
Turn my back erase all this pain now
Wouldnt it just be nice to drive away
Start again every time---Lyrics submitted by Katlin.
