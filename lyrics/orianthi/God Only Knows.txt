I feel so alone, Cant seem to find my out of this lone?
No, it dont seem right
I didnt have a chance to say goodbye.

In this this silent space, I close my eyes i can hear you say
That it's alright, but my world's such an empty place tonight.
Cause i know that, its all part of life.

[Chorus]
I wish i had the chance to say goodbye, yeah i still miss you.
so hard to see through the tears i've cried.
Yeah, i still need you.
Cause i dont want to, if i dont have to ever let you go.
The longest i'll hold on.. God only knows.

As the time goes by, it gets a little easier to smile.
I know i'll never forget everything that you said.
You said its alright, it's all part of life.

[Chorus]
I wish i had the chance to say goodbye, yeah i still miss you.
so hard to see through the tears i've cried.
Yeah, I still need you.
Cause i don't want to, if i don't have to ever let you go.
The longest i'll hold on.. God only knows.

{ The hard times} will never fade if you keep looking up
Right around there is a better place if you believe in love.
Cause i know that, its all part of life.

[Chorus]
I wish i had the chance to say goodbye, yeah i still miss you.
so hard to see through the tears i've cried.
Yeah, I still need you.
Cause i don't want to, if i don't have to ever let you go.
The longest i'll hold on, the longest i'll hold on.
The longest i'll hold on.. God only knows.
God only knows.
Ya, God only knows.
God only knows.---Lyrics submitted by Katlin.
