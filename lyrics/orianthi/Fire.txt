Hey!
Go on, light my fire
Hey!
Go on, light my fire
Hey!
Go on, light my fire
Hey!
Go on, light my fire

[Verse #2:]
Up here round the attic
All my toys are on the floor
I could hear somebody scratching
Scratching on my door
But I couldn't stand to open
To see who that could be
Well, I could hear it breathing
And the devil's here with me

[Chorus:]
Hey!
Go on, light my fire
Hey!
Go on, light my fire
Hey!
Go on, light my fire
Hey!
Light my fire

[Bridge:]
I was plinking my guitar
Like I was playing with fire
I didn't think that it would take me down
I thought it'd take me higher
It will take me higher

[Instrumental]

[Chorus:]
Hey!
Go on, light my fire
Hey!
Go on, light my fire
Hey!
Go on, light my fire
Hey!
Go on, light my fire---Lyrics submitted by andrew mcfadden.
