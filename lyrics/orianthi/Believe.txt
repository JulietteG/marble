You made it so easy to fall 
I had no fear at all 
I saw you beside me you never saw me there at all
I promised you all this  
I made plans thinking this was it 
But never imagined 
Id find you and lose myself instead 
I just never pictured this would end 

Chorus:
And I, I wanna believe in love 
I believe in something bigger than the two of us 
And I, I wanna breathe again 
I wanna go back to the days 
The days I had my innocence 
I wanna believe again 

I picked up the pieces  
And put them back where they belonged  
But somethings missing 
But part of me will carry on 
Im gonna learn to trust again 

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by David.
