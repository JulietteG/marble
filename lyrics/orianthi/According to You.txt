According to you 
I'm stupid, 
I'm useless, 
I can't do anything right. 
According to you 
I'm difficult, 
hard to please, 
forever changing my mind. 
I'm a mess in a dress, 
can't show up on time, 
even if it would save my life. 
According to you. According to you. 

But according to him 
I'm beautiful, 
incredible, 
he can't get me out of his head. 
According to him 
I'm funny, 
irresistible, 
everything he ever wanted. 
Everything is opposite, 
I don't feel like stopping it, 
so baby tell me what I got to lose. 
He's into me for everything I'm not, 
according to you. 

According to you 
I'm boring, 
I'm moody, 
and you can't take me any place. 
According to you 
I suck at telling jokes cause I always give it away. 
I'm the girl with the worst attention span; 
you're the boy who puts up with that. 
According to you. According to you. 

But according to him 
I'm beautiful, 
incredible, 
he can't get me out of his head.

Everything is opposite, 
I don't feel like stopping it, 
so baby tell me what I got to lose. 
He's into me for everything I'm not, 
according to you. 

I need to feel appreciated, 
I'm not hated. oh-- no--. 
Why can't you see me through his eyes? 
It's too bad you're making me dizz-ay. 

But according to me 
you're stupid, 
you're useless, 
you can't do anything right. 
But according to him 
I'm beautiful, 
incredible, 
he can't get me out of his head. 
According to him

baby tell me what I got to lose. 
He's into me for everything I'm not, 
According to you. you you

According to you 
I'm stupid. 
I'm useless; 
I can't do anything right.---Lyrics submitted by Bernice.
