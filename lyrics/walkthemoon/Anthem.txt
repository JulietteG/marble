I can still taste the rain that day 
When we said wed never change.
It only took you further away 
I was calling out your name
Oh, how things have changed 
How they have changed

And still I cannot help but pour like rain
Over and over and over it
I cant help but light the fire
Over and over and over again
And all the melodies like hands on me
Will ease my soul  

And its alright

Well since youve been gone
I found a brand new love in your place
But its been so long now
Would I even recognize your face?
Oh, its never the same
Never the same

And still I cannot help but pour like rain
Over and over and over it
I cant help but light the fire
Over and over and over again
And all the melodies like hands on me
Will ease my soul 

(Instrumental) 

Aint it funny how things change (change, change)
Things change
Things change (change, change)
Things change

And still I cannot help but pour like rain
Over and over and over it
I cant help but light the fire
Over and over and over again
And all the melodies like hands on me
Will ease my soul 

And its alright

(Instrumental) 

The love that you had is gone
You said it and you cant take it back alright
Your love is like a setting sun
Dont worry cause you cant go back its alright

The love that you had is gone
You said it and you cant take it back alright
Your love is like a setting sun
So dont worry cause you cant go back its alright
No you cant go back its alright
No you cant go back its alright

And all the melodies like hands on you
Will ease your soul  
And its alright---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
