I've been waitin' for you come around here.
Every moment passes by like a year,
Or so they say; and I,
I've been waitin' for you to call me up
And remind me that your mine before you show up.
Oh, in all this time,
I've been wondering how your mine, ooh.
And I confess, I never expected this.
But I,
Oh I,
I've been waitin' for you to pick up speed.
I've been waiting with everything I do,
With every deed,
And I won't get tired of waiting.
Won't you arrive?
No, I won't get tired.
But, baby, won't you try?
In all this time,
I've been wondering how your mine.
And I confess, I never expected this.
But I,
But you're higher.
Oh, Candycane Jane,
You showed me the sweetest sight.
Oh, Candycane Jane, you love me right.
And one of these days,
We're gonna' be side by side.
And during those sweetness,
I can't find in your Jane.
I've been waiting for you to turn me on.
I'm hanging on all up til' dawn.
But, baby, I'm waiting for you to come back home.
I'm waiting to tell you I'm yours, and yours alone.
Oh, in all this time,
I've been wondering how your mine.
Ooh ooh
I confess, it's much more than a kiss.
And when I kiss you,
Oooh, I miss you.
Oh, Candycane Jane,
You showed me the sweetest sight.
Oh, Candycane Jane, you love me right.
And one of these days, we're gonna' be side by side.
And during those sweetness,
I can't find.
There ain't no heights that I can't climb,
There are no secrets I can't find,
In your Jane.---Lyrics submitted by maria.
