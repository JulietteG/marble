Working hard and dreaming heavy,
So Sebastian waits with baited breath tonight. 

(Refrain)
Singing ooh, 
I am a man on the moon,
Oh yeah, and I'm gonna fly
If I can just jump high enough.

'Cause he's breaking his back just to see that day
And it's taking him back to his childhood days.
Never been so close to the stars before,
And they're all laughing 'cause they think he's crazy.
Did you know 'Bastian's talking in his sleep all night?

Singing ooh,
I am a man on the moon,
Oh yeah, and I'm gonna lift off
If I can just jump high enough.

Oooh, mmm

Oh, Mr. Jackson why don't you step away from the edge
Before you wind up dead?
But he says "Oh no, thanks for asking, I'd rather be the same, lad,
The same, so get out of my head."
He's wishing with his everything and breathing heavy,
And with one jump Sebastian Jackson takes his life,

Singing ooh, 
I am a man on the moon,
Oh yeah, and I'm gonna fly
If I can just jump high enough.

'Cause he's breaking his back just to see that day
And it's taking him back to his childhood days.
Never been so close to the stars before,
Wondering every day that he wakes, could this be the day?

Woahh, oh no.

Singing oooohh, the man on the moon,
I'm gonna lift off if I can just jump high enough.
Ohhhh,
The man on the moon, I'm gonna fly,
Just spread my wings and fly, I'll fly alright.

I'm gonna fly.---Lyrics submitted by Luke Lorfeld.
