You grip your hands around my throat
You strip the buttons off my coat
I choose the methods I do best
Thump, thump
The thumping in your chest

When you are close to me I shiver

You leave these marks up on my neck
Still there... I know but I still check
Thump, thump the thumping in my chest
As I loose the feeling in my fingertips

When you are close to me I shiver

Owly, you're dear to me
Please check your clothing at the door
And who you're supposed to be
You always leave me wanting more
Owly, you're dear to me
Shall we get intimate again?
Owly, you're dear to me
Shall we get intimate again?

Shall we get intimate again?
I think so
Shall we get intimate again?
Only, you're dear to me

When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver, shiver---
