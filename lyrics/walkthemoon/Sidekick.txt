We walk out the cinema about to go our separate ways, and I
I almost wave goodbye when you let your hair fall on your face
And I often wonder why things that I want are so hard to find
But I often fail to see the things I need are right here by my side

Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is giving me dangerous thoughts like
Why don't you stay at mine tonight
Why don't you stay at mine tonight
Why don't you stay with me and be my sidekick, sidekick
Do you, do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick

He's left hanging in the door a trail of shoes and winter coats
And we kissing on the kitchen floor
Press you up against the ropes
And don't you wonder why the things that you want are so hard to find
Well, it just occurred to me the one that I need could be right here by my side

Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is giving me crazy thoughts like
Why don't you stay at mine tonight
Why don't you stay at mine tonight
Why don't you stay with me and be my sidekick, sidekick
Do you, do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick

Do you, do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick
Do you, do you, do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick
Do you, do you, do you want to be my

Do you want to be my
Do you want to be my

Something in the air is giving me bad ideas
Something in the air is telling me you could be my sidekick, sidekick
Do you, do you, do you wanna be my sidekick, sidekick
Do you want to be my sidekick, sidekick
If so come on, let's go---
