The clock strikes one and youre already gone
The clock strikes two and it wakes you
The light is on and you turn it off
And thats the way it is.

The day is out but the night goes on
Fooling yourself into feeling
Making love to the ceiling
And thats the way it is.

The light is on and you burn it out
The girl is yours and you doubt
The light is on and you turn it off
And shes a stone cold fox
Stone cold, stone cold, 
Stone cold, stone cold

Youre passing her by and you dont ask why
Youre in "no questions asked"
Still it put you to the test
And are you looking around.

The light is on and you burn it out
The girl is yours and you doubt
The light is on and you turn it off
And shes a stone cold fox
Stone cold, stone cold, 
Stone cold, stone cold

The light is on and you burn it out
The girl is yours and you doubt
The light is on and you turn it off
And shes a stone cold fox
Stone cold, stone cold, 
Stone cold, stone cold---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
