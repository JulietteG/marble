Easy now, with my heart
Easy now, oh with my heart
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope
You walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope
But oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up

Careful now, with my head
I said careful now, what you do to my head
Make your mind up, make your little mind up
To each his own, each his or her own oh, oh, oh,
But oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this heart is burning up

In my head, I'm rolling over
I'm changing,
I've been the change on the swings on the set on the night that we met
And now the beads of water, move up the glass
You speak your mind, and you can not take it back
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope
Walk a tightrope, walk a little tightrope
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
I said oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, oh, oh this heart is burning up
Its, its burning up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...---Lyrics submitted by Courtney.
