Snap away she said
As they danced towards the moonlight
Run away he did
As she cast off another night
So intuned were we
By the thought of what could never be
So consumed were we 
By feelings felt between the sheets

What do they mean
Seamless dirty dreams
Why must you scream
Please don't make a scene
She thinks she plays
Is it all a game
No need to be tame
Sugar melts the acid rain

I saw you wading in the water
I saw you ride along the sea
Shine on a nightmare
Shine through the trees

Ahhh-ahhh. ahhh-ahhhh x4
