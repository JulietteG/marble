What have i said?
Give me a clue
What have i done to you?

Whenever i'm there
You give me a stare
Breaking my heart in two

I wanna be your friend 
Oh yeah
I wanna be your friend

I wanna be your friend
Oh yeah
I wanna be your friend

Wouldn't it be good?
Wouldn't it be great?
Wouldn't it be oh so fine?

If I was theirs
If they were yours
Maybe if you were mine?

I wanna be your friend
Oh yeah
I wanna be your friend

I wanna be your friend
Oh yeah 
I wanna be your friend

Ahh
Ahhh-Ahh
Ahhh-Ahh
Ahhhhhhhhhhh-
Ahh
Ahhh-Ahh
Ahhh-Ahh
Ahhhhhhhhhhh----Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
