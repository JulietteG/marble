we have all been wasting our time
for sunlight
there's only so much we'll take
far from the only light brown ocean

Find yourself a new boy

(unknown)

So put your hands on your wasteline
And move your body to the bassline
And get your hands on some cheap wine
And get out get out like a trout

(unknown)---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
