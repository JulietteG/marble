I'm so tired
I fall asleep when i speak to you
Tonight

Close my mind
In my dreams i am known by you
Alright

We've been dreaming differently
I said baby that's what you mean to me

Georgia
What's a girl to do?
Georgia
Still in love with you

Love and fear
They should not have been resting here
This year

Feel alright
When we both go our separate ways
Hold tight

We've been dreaming differently
I said baby that's what you mean to me

Georgia
What's a girl to do?
