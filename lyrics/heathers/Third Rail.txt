Ohhh
This is where we're all gonna go
Ohhhh
This is where we're all gonna go

Ohh ohhhhh
This is where we stand
Ohh ohhhhh
This is where we stand
Yeah this is where we stand

Cause we don't know
Many people see us when we go oh oh
Yeah, We don't know
Many people see us when we go oh oh

Ohh ohh
Don't be so shy, you're so beautiful ohhh
Noo ohhh,
This will pass
Someday we'll remember it all

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhoh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohhoh

You don't know anywhere better than I do
(No you dont)
You don't know anywhere better than I do

So we crawl
To the end
Of the tunnel hidden deeper oh
We will fight
To defend
or we crumble under up above
You can hold your breath until it lets
Everything end
We will pay for all the thoughts we've spent
Trying to forget

You don't know anywhere better than I do
You don't know anywhere better than I do

Cause we don't know
(You don't know anywhere better than I do)
Yeah we don't know
(You don't know anywhere better than I do)
Cause we don't know
(You don't know anywhere better than I do)
Many people see us when we go oh oh
(You don't know anywhere better than I do)
Yeah we don't know
(You don't know anywhere better than I do)
Many people see us when we go oh oh
(You don't know anywhere better than I do)---
