Money, money, chain, situation
Money, money, chain, situation

My current situation a lituation
My current situation a lituation
Don't keep that money waitin', it get impatient
You niggas get to hatin', you get ovations
Bottles on the way lituation
Models in the face lituation
When I come around it goes down
Money, money, chain, situation

It's a movie, get your Goobers, nigga
Yeah, it gets deep, get ya scuba, nigga
Uh, I got the swipers in the gun shop
Yeah, I got the shooters in the uber nigga
Wooh! Everything brand new my nigga
Lord Jamar, Grand Puba nigga
Uh, they callin' me Fidel cash flow
Yeah, and the link come from Cuba nigga
Team plastic like the ass shots
Plastic Glock 9 get ya ass shot
Dream team, gold chain, match watch
And the bad bitches be the mascot
Yeah, got your bm in my BM nigga
Yeah, she got taken, word to Liam nigga
Ha, we ain't gotta be a hundred deep
I'd rather 10 lions than a hundred sheep

My current situation a lituation
My current situation a lituation
Don't keep that money waitin', it get impatient
You niggas get to hatin', you get ovations
Bottles on the way lituation
Models in the face lituation
When I come around it goes down
Money, money, chain, situation

Yeah, this shit different nigga
Yeah, I can't explain it's just different nigga
Yeah, this is hood gettin' money rap
Yeah, this a million on a [?] nigga
Wooh! This is stuntin' at the baby shower
Yeah, and it all came from baby powder
I buy her Ros you buy your lady flowers
Special thanks goes to the haze and sour
Respect brought the money than it gave me power
Sneak dissin' always been a fav of cowards
Oh, you don't wanna take it there
Where I'm from all they do is take it there
I came from no space wasn't safe
Now it's like no space in a safe
I do it big and light skin my new faith
And we skip to my lou in that new Wraith, aaah

My current situation a lituation
My current situation a lituation
Don't keep that money waitin', it get impatient
You niggas get to hatin', you get ovations
Bottles on the way lituation
Models in the face lituation
When I come around it goes down
Money, money, chain, situation---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
