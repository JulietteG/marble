(Chorus:)
This is the last time
I know I'm about to drive you crazy,
Last time
But I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I'll never break your heart no more
Try to walk
But I just can't leave her alone girl
She keep calling me, calling me
I try to leave her alone but
She keep calling me, calling me
And I gotta go

(Fabolous:)
Damn here we go again
I just came back, girl don't make me go again
She say you been in the streets
You was with that hoe again
Money wrapped in rubber bands
Whatchu selling blow again
I see that you holding down
But you call that hoe your friend
You ain't 'pose to bring her home
Whatchu doing show her that
I was like show her that, never that
Oh no anybody in the streets know that's a no no
So no, I will never ever ever ever
Maybe I'm a g, yeah that's right the 7th letter
See one thing about the streets
I know where that heffer at
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her hat
But you know we had a bond
No ring no paper and I don't hear that shit when I'm bringing home paper

(chorus)

(Fabolous:)
Hi honey I'm home
She looked at me and said it's 5 some in the mon
You smell like you been drinking, the vibe from you is strong
I said baby that's cologne she said nigga that's patron
If you wanna keep with them bad habits, that's fine
You think I'm with it then you out your rabbit ass mind
They say Trix are for kids, most chicks with a Sid
But who ain't miss a visit through the 6 that you did
I'll be down if I do another 6 with some kids who only see they daddy in them flicks on the fidge
Them niggas that you thinking are in a mix with cha shit
They the same reason Michael Vick doing biz
I say hold up I met cha when I was thugging back then
And you was riding with me holding on a mac 10
But that was back then you ain't give whattt?
Now you standing here telling me to give her up

(chorus)

(Fabolous:)
Hold on baby please,
You can't leave now no john baby please
We gonna get you to the hospital as quickly as possible
Life is full of obstacles
We gonna get you through this one
You look at me in the eye when you told me you was done
But I played a full fool but I guess I was the foolish one
Remember when she told she know that she know hottest dream is late night
Phone calls from one of my close friends
Telling you that we are rushing to the E-R
By this time the mall we was supposed to be in D-R
Me blowing a cigar you sippin a tini
I told to pack a bag and don't forgot a bikini
Then just like a houdini it all disappeared
Thus skip the paradise, then live like this a swear
Sorry baby girl
I tried the best I could
If I can't be in the streets, I guess heaven is just as good
