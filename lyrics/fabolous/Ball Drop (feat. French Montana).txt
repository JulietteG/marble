When that hate don't work they start telling lies
Baby work, go on bust it wide
It's that new money, let the drugs dry
I cut my bitch off when the ball drop

Haan
(Whoa whoa whoa)
Haan
(Whoa whoa whoa)
Haan
(Whoa whoa whoa)
Haan
(Whoa whoa whoa)
I just don't know why

Hating hoes ain't happy
And happy hoes ain't hatin'
Better check the situation
I could fix your situation
Whoa whoa whoa
I cut them bitches off when the ball drop
New money, new year, then the call dropped
New money, new year, let them drugs drop
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Cause them real niggas ain't hate
And them hatin' niggas ain't real
And baby I could help your situation
No top smokin' medication

This the new year resolution
We gotta be the winners cause the rest is losin'
I told em get money, that's the best solution
When you do, wear your rocket like you rest in Houston
When niggas throw my style I ain't stressed to boostin'
It's time to make more money, less excuses
My old bitch on death row, it's time for execution
My new bitch is bad ass, she the best since Boosie

I just don't know why

12 o' clock in the car drop
Cut them niggas off when the ball drops
Young boy, hot head in the soft top
Cause when them shots ain't ringin' you can't call shots
Mix some white and brown on the corner strap
Might be the Mike Brown, where you rollin' at
V with a hundred on the Lincoln
3 quarter mag blew the tank off Lincoln
Niggas scared to play it like Richard Mellor
I hope I never Tom Heller, die
Scramble like a gold fiend (dope fiend)
Keep your head up like your nose bleedin'
But right here got 30 ounce left on
On that left lane nigga with a bitch form
I just don't know why

(Whoa whoa whoa)

Cuttin' off hoes when the ball drop
Ridin' with my woes til' the casket drop
Quiet for you suckas, hear a pin drop
I buy this mother fucker like the price drop
Shawty bag it up, let that ass drop
Mommy killin' em, [?] tear drop
Bitch I'm on fire, need to stop drop
Nigga this the flow that got your artist dropped
Heard he was a rat, heard he done dropped
Hit em in the head, watch the body drop
Dollars coming down like rain drops
New year, new money, nigga ball drop

Haan
