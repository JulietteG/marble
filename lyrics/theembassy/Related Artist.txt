I, have so many questions
The turn, Ill tell you one
Id tell you one, agenda
And race, I care

There are some things
I always raced through
And theyre not the same as you

Im watching you do, agend
And race, always

Your race, takes piece, again
And I, I wanna be a related
So I sound, a less like to you
Can I be related too
A young boy, Im real bad
A bye, bye.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
