anything, everything we had is over
i made mistakes, you said goodbye
don't let me catch you crying
anything, everything we had is over
when it falls apart i won't be there, i won't be there

the story starts at our first show
running the door dressed to impress a guy like me, looking good
the conversation started right, i had you laughing through the night
and i reeled you in, hooked and caught

one stab to the center of your heart
one cut is all you ever need
i don't want this anymore
but you'll never get me

anything, everything we had is over
i made mistakes, you said goodbye
don't let me catch you crying
anything, everything we had is over
when it falls apart i won't be there, i won't be there

fast forward just three days ago
i had it all and i let it go
another reckless night and i hurt you again
and after the fifth or sixth drink
i didn't care what you would think
am i guilty of lust? i'll plead the fifth

one stab to the center of your heart
one cut is all you ever need
i don't want this anymore
but you'll never get me

anything, everything we had is over
i made mistakes, you said goodbye
don't let me catch you crying
anything, everything we had is over
when it falls apart i won't be there, i won't be there---Lyrics submitted by benz.
