Did you think we'd let this slide
We tried to leave the past behind, but here we go again.
Keep on writing songs about us
(you could never be one of us)
You can run, but you can't hide from your lies.

(Chorus)
Without, without you, we are everything you said we couldn't be.
Without, without you, we're everything you'll never be.


We knew something wasn't right the first time 
We saw that look in your eyes, 
But there you go again
Thinking everybody owes you
(It's your ego that controls you).
You're whole persona is contriced, you're a lie. 

(Chorus)
Without, without you, we are everything you said we couldn't be.
Without, without you, we're everything you'll never be.

And if we see you on the street you better look down at your feet.
You need to understand that this is not a game. 
You'll feel the pain.

(Chorus)X2
Without, without you, we are everything you said we couldn't be. 
Without, without you, we're everything you'll never be.---Lyrics submitted by aaron.
