We parked our car on the lower east side 
And thats when she caught my eye yeah 
She dressed so scandalous 
But girls like that don't mess with guys like us 
But I need to know her name
When I hit that floor
Gonna give her more then she bargained for

(Chorus)
Hey! you know 
Love how your body flows
Hey! You know 
Lets see how far this goes
Tension so thick girl I can't wait 
To see how well your moves translate
Think your more then I can take

Now I'm staring so hard shes gotta feel it, 
Baby this ain't the look of love, no
Chassy like a Cadillac 
Curves so tight that I might crash but 
Hot Damn what a way to go 

We meet on the floor 
She never seen moves like this before 
Heading for the door 
Gonna give her more then she bargained for 

(Chorus)x3---Lyrics submitted by aaron.
