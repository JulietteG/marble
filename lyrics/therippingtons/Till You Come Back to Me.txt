Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I want to tell you Baby
The changes I've been going through
Missing you.
Listen you

'till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free oh baby
I'm gonna swallow my pride
I'm gonna beg you to (please baby please) 
baby won't you see me
I'm gonna walk by myself
Just to prove that my love is true
Only for you baby

'till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Oh yes I am

Living for you my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
In my plea, I've got to make you see
That our love is dying

Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp on your step
Until I get through to you
I've got to change your view
'till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

That's what I'm gonna do
'till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do
Gotta make you change your mind
'till you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
Tap on your window pane
I'm gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
