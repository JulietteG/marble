Minds, hearts, teeth, drive
Her quaint towns thrive
Minds, hearts, teeth, drive
Trash road swan dive
Think now us good
Most are
Filled up soul
Empty Jar

The controller.... control her....

Lips, milk, throat, trip
Kneel, bow, fall, skip
Lips, milk, throat, trip
Rope hung smile fit
Think us now fools
Most are
Filled up hard
Emptied what?

The controller... control her...

Minds, hearts, teeth, drive
Her quaint towns thrive
Minds, hearts, teeth, drive
Trash road swan dive
Think now us good
Most are
Filled up soul
Empty Jar

Controller... controller.. the controller---Lyrics submitted by Marth Guillemette.
