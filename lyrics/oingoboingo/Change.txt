DON'T YOU EVER WONDER WHY
NOTHING EVER SEEMS TO CHANGE?
IF IT DOES IT'S FOR THE WORSE
SEEMS IT'S JUST A MODERN CURSE
SOMETIMES WHEN I TAKE A PEEK 
OUTSIDE OF MY LITTLE CAGE
EVERYONE LOOKS SO ASLEEP
WILL THEY DIE BEFORE THEY WAKE?
HEY, DON'T YOU KNOW?
WE'RE JUST PRODUCTS OF OUR TIME AND 
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
SHOW ME YOURS AND I'LL SHOW YOU MINE
BETTER DUMB AND HAPPY THAN
SMART AND WITHOUT ANY FRIENDS
BETTER CUTE AND BETTER PROUD
BETTER JOIN UP WITH THE CROWD
PEOPLE FOR THE HAPPY TIMES
THERE'S A DUST STORM IN MY MIND
SEEMS I CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT THESE DAYS
DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAYS
HEY, DON'T YOU KNOW?
WE'RE JUST PRODUCTS OF OUR TIME AND 
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
SHOW ME YOURS AND I'LL SHOW YOU MINE
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
PLEASE DON'T EVER
OH GOD HERE'S THAT QUESTION NOW
THE ONE THAT MAKES ME GO INSANE
I'D GLADLY TEAR MY HEART OUT 
IF YOU NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER CHANGE
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE?
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE RIGHT NOW?
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE?
I LIKE MY STUPID LIFE JUST THE WAY IT IS
AND I WOULDN'T EVEN CHANGE IT FOR A THOUSAND FLYING PIGS
AND I LIKE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE
I LIKE YOUR FACE JUST THE WAY IT IS
AND I WOULDN'T EVEN TRADE IT FOR A HERD OF SCREAMING KIDS
AND I LIKE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE
I LIKE YOU THOUGH YOU MAY NOT LIKE ME BACK
I WOULD DAZZLE YOU WITH BRILLIANCE IF I ONLY HAD THE KNACK
CAUSE I LIKE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE
I LIKE THIS LIFE JUST THE WAY IT IS
AND THE CASTLES ALL AROUND ME
HAVE BEEN MELTING DOWN FOR YEARS
AND IT KILLS MY BRAIN TO THINK OF ALL 
THE TIME I'VE WASTED HERE
ALL THE EFFORT, SWEAT AND BROKEN HEARTS
THE SCREAMING AND THE TEARS
AND I'M DREAMING AGAIN...
AND I'M DREAMING AGAIN...
AND I'M DREAMING AGAIN...                         
FLOATING IN A POOL OF MUD
TRYING TO GET BACK WHERE I WAS AND
I DON'T REALLY CARE
DON'T REMEMBER WHO I'M TALKING TO
WHY, THE MIRROR IN MY ROOM AND
I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHISPERING VOICES FROM THE DEAD
COME FROM UNDERNEATH MY BED AND
I DON'T REALLY CARE
I LIKE MY STUPID LIFE, JUST THE WAY IT IS
AND THE CHAOS THAT SURROUNDS ME
LIKE A FLOCK OF SCREAMING PIGS
AND IT HURTS MY BRAIN TO THINK OF ALL THE STUPID THINGS I'VE SAID
AND IF I COULD CHANGE THE FUTURE, I WOULD CHANGE THE PAST INSTEAD
AND I'M DREAMIN' AGAIN (4X'S)
BABY, SOMETIMES I WORRY ABOUT YOU, SOMETIMES YOU'RE SO FAR AWAY
TELL ME WHAT TO DO, AND I SAY 
BABY, SOMETIMES I WORRY ABOUT YOU, SOMETIMES I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
EVERYTHING YOU DO, AND I SAY BABY, SOMETIMES I WORRY ABOUT YOU
EVERY DAY I FEEL THE SAME, CAN'T YOU FEEL IT TOO? I SAY
BABY, SOMETIMES I WORRY ABOUT ME, SEEMS I'M FALLIN' DOWN A LOT
BABY, SOMETIMES I WORRY ABOUT ME, GETTING HARDER ALL THE TIME
BABY, SOMETIMES I WORRY ABOUT ME, LIGHT ANOTHER CIGARETTE
HAVE ANOTHER DREAM....
IT'S THE SAME THING EVERYDAY, NOTHING EVER SEEMS TO CHANGE AND I.....
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO? REALLY WANT TO?
HEY, WHAT DO YA SAY? HEY, WHAT DO YA SAY? PLEASE DON'T EVER....
TESTAMENTS AND GROWING PAINS, TRANQUILIZERS FOR THE SOUL
NOTHING VENTURED, NOTHING GAINED, EVOLUTIONS CRUELEST JOKE
WHY IS EVERYONE UPSET? I ONCE KNEW BUT I FORGET
SOMETHING HAPPENED, SOMETHING STRANGE
SOMETHING IT APPEARS HAS CHANGED AND HEY, DON'T YOU KNOW?
WE'RE JUST PRODUCTS OF OUR TIME AND HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
IF I SHOW YOU YOURS WILL YOU SHOW ME MINE?
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY? HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
PLEASE DON'T, PLEASE..OH GOD HERE'S THAT QUESTION NOW
THE ONE THAT MAKES ME GO INSANE, I'D GLADLY TEAR MY HEART OUT
IF YOU'D NEVER CHANGE, NEVER CHANGE
NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER CHANGE---Lyrics submitted by steve.
