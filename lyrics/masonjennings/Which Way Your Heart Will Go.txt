Little airplane in the sky
You point up at.
I watch your face as you watch it go by.
Everything is perfect.

CHORUS:
Where would I be right now,
if all my dreams had come true?
Deep down I know somehow,
I'd have never seen your face.
This world would be a different place.
Gone and there's no way to know,
Which way to go.

Summer sun on a sandy slide,
Silver swingset shining.
How can life feel so alive,
and still feel like dying?

CHORUS

A stack of books beside our bed,
Living out of boxes.
Why does the empty space fill with dread?
Why does change still shock us?

Where would we be right now,
if all our dreams had come true?
Deep down I know somehow,
I'd have never seen your face.
This world would be a different place.
Darling there's no way to know
Which way your heart will go.
Which way your heart will go---Lyrics submitted by beverly.
