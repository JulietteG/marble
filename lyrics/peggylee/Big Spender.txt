The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real big spender
Good looking, so refined
Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind? 

So let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey, big spender!
spend a little time with me 

Do you wanna have fun?
How's about a few laughs?
I can show you a good time.
Do you wanna have fun, fun, fun...?
How's about a few laughs, lauhgs, laughs...?
I can show you a good time, good time.
Fun, Laughs, Goodtime!
What do you say to (how's abouta) laughs?
I can give you some (are you ready for some) fun?
How would you like a (I can show you a) good time

Hey big spender!
Hey big spender!

The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real big spender
Good looking, so refined
Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind? 

So let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey, big spender!
Hey, big spender!
Hey, big spender!
Spend a little time with me

Fun, laughs, good time
Fun, laughs, good time
Fun. laughs, good time---Lyrics submitted by Nicki.
