What if I'm wrong
Because I haven't been here for long
Will I learn from my mistakes?
What if I'm wrong
I'll know that I still belong
To the world around me

So much of life
Could never be explained
Evolve from the person that you are
Into the one that blinds you

Just know that losing control
Is all part of this
Losing control...

Sing with me
This is how we aspirate
Take your eyes off the noise
There's still progress to be made

What if I said that the water was over my head
Would you stand there watching me?
What if I said all of the blood I had shed
Was collecting by my feet
Create a masterpiece
With what you learn
Leave me to the lies surrounding you

We will all evolve
Into working machines
Controlling the world

Just know that losing control
Is all part of this
Losing control...

Sing with me
This is how we aspirate
Take your eyes off the noise.
There's still progress to be made
Take your eyes off the north
Sing with me
This is how we aspirate
There's still progress to be made
Take your eyes off the noise
It shouldn't take falling through the skies
To realize that we all did wrong
Sing with me
This is how we aspirate
There's still progress to be made---Lyrics submitted by Billy.
