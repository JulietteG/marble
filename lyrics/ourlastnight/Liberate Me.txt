You no faith 
You had no heart
You wanted war right from the start

We were not the same

You tried to find the demons inside of me
But little did you know I had set them free

We were not the same
You made me insane
We were not the same

There never any finger prints to hide
Because your death was a suicide
There was no evidence to find
Because it wasn't me who committed the crime

You took my voice
You took my pride
But now you're gone so both are mine

We were not the same
You made the wrong moves at the right times
Was it fate or was it just in your mind

We were not the same
You made me insane
We were not the same

There were never any prints to hide
Because your death was a suicide
There was no evidence to find
Because it wasn't me who committed the crime

You tried to lock me down
I found the key
Liberate Me
You tried to lock me down
I found the key

I said "You'll never take my freedom away"
And those were the words that made us separate 

There were never any finger prints to hide
Because your death was a suicide
There was no evidence to find
Because it wasn't me
There were never any finger prints to hide
Because your death was a suicide
There was no evidence to find
Because it wasn't me who committed the crime---Lyrics submitted by Brennan McCarty.
