I eat my dinner in the bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything I'm restless
Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Dazed and kinda lonely

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
I gotta stay high all my life to
Forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Pick up mommy's at the playground
How I spend my day time
Loosen up their frown, make them feel alive
Oh make it fast and greasy I'm
numb and way too easy

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryin to forget you babe, I fall back down
I gotta stay high all my life to
Forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
I gotta stay high all my life to
Forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh---
