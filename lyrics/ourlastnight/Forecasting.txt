And now were face first in a fist full of set backs

We'll make our way to the top
We'll pave the way to the top
We'll take this next step onward
Because we can't afford to look back now
Dont look back down

We'll take the next step onward
Listen in for the voices
Listen in for the voices

The forcast said the storm would miss
We knew they were wrong 
When the wind rushed in

We'll take the next step onward
Because we can't afford to look back now
Dont look back down

We'll take the next step onward
Listen in for the voices
Listen in for the voices

I'll be looking for
Whoa, medication
And while your looking for...---Lyrics submitted by !abby!.
