They will lock you up and throw away the key
where no one will ever find you.
You were send to destroy the world
you were meant to be the end of hope for all mankind

I'd been wasting away.
I let you get away so cleanly.
Without a trace, without a sound.
By now my hope for you has fleeted me.

They will dig a hole and bury you
I wasted away so many days in hell.
I wasted away so many days in hell with you.
I was a walking deadman
living the truth with a liar by my side.

I let you get away, without a sound.
You were sent to destroy the world.
