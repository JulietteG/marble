I love me better than that (Yeah)
Im going to get my life back
As I look (as I look) in the mirror
A broken woman I see
Broken down by the streets of lifes journey
That broken woman is me
So I take me a little ride
Back down memory lane
Past the verbal and the physical abuse and
All the drama and the pain
Ive got to flee from this crazy situation
Cause its driving me insane
Now Im packing up all of my broken pieces
And the little bit of strength that remains

Chorus

Cause
I love me (I love me better than that)
Than to lay here and cry
Wont just stay here and die
Im going to get my life back (Im gonna to get my life back)
I know I made my mistakes
But its never too late

Do I have any sisters
Who will agree with me
Its time to come to your senses
Its time to face reality
I hear you sister girl when youre saying
I just dont wanna be lonely
But its impossible to love somebody else when
You dont even love yourself
Its time to flee from this crazy situation
Cause its driving you insane
So come on and pack up all your broken pieces
And all the strength that remains
Pick up yourself and say

Chorus

I love me better than that (I love me so much better)
Than to lay here and cry (Yeah)
Wont just here and die
Im going to get my life back (Get my life back, yeah, yeah)
Im gonna get my life back
Get my life back
The enemy comes
To kill and destroy (But Im gonna get my life back)
To take your hopes and dreams
And to steal all of your joy (I said Im gonna get my life back)
But as a child of God
I hope you can see
That hell renew your strength
And he will give you victory

Chorus

I love me better than that (I love me better)
Im going to get my life back
Im gonna take it back
You see Im made up in my mind
I want my joy back
I want my peace back
I want my strength back
All my sisters help me sing
I want my joy back
I want my peace back
I want my strength back
I want my mind back
My self-esteem back
I want my keys back
Say it, say it, say it, say it
I want my mind back (Oh yeah)
My self-esteem back
I want my keys back
I want my hope back
I want my dreams back
So dont you come back (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

I want my hope back (I want my hopes back)
I want my dreams back (Dreams back)
So dont you come back
Im gonna get my life back
Cause I love me
I love me better than that (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
