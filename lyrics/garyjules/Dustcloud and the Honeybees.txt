You always say "Life is hard"
So it is
Then you disappear in a dust cloud
Spinning wheels and yarns
We sing a song
Then you disappear in a dust cloud
And I'm 

Hanging on
Hanging on
All the wiser folks are gone
And I'm hanging on

The news is bad
It always was
It always will be

And when you day you find me in a crowd
Say it's good to see me
But my eyes are stinging
And it's hard to breathe
For the dust cloud rising
And the honeybees

Hanging on
Hanging on for so long
And I'm hanging on
Hanging on
Hanging on---Lyrics submitted by Marco.
