rating agencies
financial markets
and the G20's
but who are these people
and why on earth do we care about their opinion?
what do we care about their self-proclaimed authority?

rating agencies
financial markets
and the G20's
were not elected by the people
in the name of what are we letting them govern our lives?
they are politically illegitimate 

enough already with the dictatorship, tyranny of money
we want a real, a real democracy
