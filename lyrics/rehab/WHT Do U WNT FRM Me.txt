I've tried it all twice or more
Told the lies and hit the floor
Broken down, what is real?
Hoping, doubt try to kill
Each other in the war that's in
My head I hurt from all my sins
Grin and bare the pain and angst
Sort thru all my brain's complaints
Ain't enough I need some help
What's it like to be myself
Hands are shaky, fuse is short
Starin' at the news report
To ignore the sound is hard
Bankrupt with a credit card
House I live in is a mess
Sqwermin in my flesh

What do you want from me?
I have given all I can
I don't know what it's gonna take
Can you make me understand?
What do you want from me?
Is it just no use to try?
I don't know what it's gonna take
Because I've no more tears to cry

Got no dough to pay the bills
Sanity ran for the hills
Sorta feels like comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down
Lightnin' flashing, poorin' rain
My reflection says you're in pain
You're insane, can't explain
Why I tend to think these things
Demons with there horns and fangs
Steal from you then call you names
Planes and trains, automobiles
Same thing as a bag of pills
Make it strong and make it fast
Ain't no way to make it last
Down and out, sick and tired
I wallow in the mire

What do you want from me?
I have given all I can
I don't know what it's gonna take
Can you make me understand?
What do you want from me?
Is it just no use to try?
I don't know what it's gonna take
Because I've no more tears to cry

Workin' hard may leave you broke
Gotta learn to steal from folks
Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie
Chevrolet not zenith skies
Sky's are full of poison air
Family photo, comb your hair
Wear a smile, wear a tie
Lie and don't be camera shy
Damn if I could be like you
I'd make the same mistakes you do
Murder people over seas
For the need to feed your greed
Nothing's free, a price was paid
With a rocket propelled grenade
Morning's purple, day is gray
Just wanted to say hey

What do you want from me?
I have given all I can
I don't know what it's gonna take
Can you make me understand?
What do you want from me?
Is it just no use to try?
I don't know what it's gonna take
Because I've no more tears to cry

What do you want from me?
I have given all I can
I don't know what it's gonna take
Can you make me understand?
What do you want from me?
Is it just no use to try?
I don't know what it's gonna take
Because I've no

Are you scared to death and do you count your breath
what's really going don't got much time left
the next
second is now and now was just then
and i'll never
get that moment back again
[twice]

We are running out of time
We are falling way behind
We are all loosing our minds
We are, We are, We are---Lyrics submitted by matt.
