I've gotta drinkin' problem man one mouth and two hands
And an empty can I ain't got no loochie loochie
And yall don't understand I'm just a simple man
Doin' the best I can without no loochie

I'm feelin' that funny feelin' again within walkin' me to the kitchen
For that early morning gin drink it in till my thoughts they become clear
Dress my naked ass and head the fuck up outta here fightin' traffic
The hot sun be causin' havoc ass stuck to the seaat window cracked can't see passed it the liquor store I just passed it
Lookin' back I gotta turn around 
I can't stop thinkin' exactly that u-turn the past I leave behind for the ill bumpin' two busted six by nines
And I feel this day to be a good one of plenty even if I'm thirsty and my pockets are empty

I've gotta drinkin' problem man one mouth and two hands
And an empty can I ain't got no loochie loochie
And yall don't understand I'm just a simple man
Doin' the best I can without no loochie

Come from a long line of alcoholics livin' from toilet to toilet you call it
I'm callin' hotlines swervin' all over yellow lines drinkin' moonshine
Damn was that a stop sign
I ain't doin' good but I'll be fine danno where's that cheap wine
Drunk since 9 guzzlin' boones farm
Trying to stop my shakin' arm
I'm here to stumble the earth and forewarn
7 weeks since I had had shower I black out like you pulled the plug on Georgia Power Southern discomfort baby
Seein' pink elephants on down the freeway the proof on the bottle 180 runnin' out of Loochiey
And I won't survive if you don't let me borrow another five I'm a do it anyway if I'm alive

I've gotta drinkin' problem man one mouth and two hands
And an empty can I ain't got no loochie loochie
And yall don't understand I'm just a simple man
Doin' the best I can without no loochie

Spent my last money on a pabst blue ribbon I be gulpin never sippin
Cuz I have to booted out the crib and that's cool
Lone as I have brew face flush stare at a lush I might bust you in the gums
I gotta problemo my life's too up tempo but yo I'm just simple man whose mind is crippled man it all started at a party
and I was only 15 now I can kill a fifth of Bacardi and I drink and pass out wake up ass out and start again 
I been to AA but hey hey gimme the bottle 12 steppers actin like they never took a swallow

I've gotta drinkin' problem man one mouth and two hands
And an empty can I ain't got no loochie loochie
And yall don't understand I'm just a simple man
Doin' the best I can without no loochie---Lyrics submitted by matt.
