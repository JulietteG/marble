An excess rules everything I do
So tell me how can I be more like you
Cause all of this don't seem to bother you
So tell me how can I be more like you

The lights are on but nobody's home
If I'm mad, well them my mouth foam
Cover my transportation in chrome
Under the sky dome
Pegasus flown over my skeletal features
But an opaque anatomy is all I'll ever be
For none to see

A numb teacher holding a counseling position
Posture remaining unchristian
Slouchin' down so low I'm missing
Caverns and taverns is where I sought my refuge
Stood in the foyer of the brothel meshing with sin
Grippin' a bottle
How many times I sat up in the night sky
Craving to die, wanting to fly
Knowing this was all a lie
The succubus French kissed me in the orafice
Complex as Oedipus left in my mouth a taste of distrust
Lust for flesh & bone, but ain't no angels in dust
Ain't no heroines in opium, word up I scoped 'em
There ain't no answers this is all random evolution
Best check the chemicals in your solution
You might be prostitutin'

An excess rules everything I do
So tell me how can I be more like you
Cause all of this don't seem to bother you
So tell me how can I be more like you

Why is everything so technical, got me thinkin' mechanical
Puffi' on those botanicals, every second so critical
Board with the human language
Anguish, beats on my mental, fuckin' with chemicals
Sick as the appetites of cannibals
Far away they shoot a laser from a computer
It ricochets off a satellite panel
To a missile silo in Cuba
Eyes behold catastrophe
Forseen by Nostradamus, the prophets peep the millennium
Age of the broken promise
More religions than park pigeons
The poor envy the rich and
Monetary decisions make pessimistic the vision
It's like the whole planet went off the deep end
While I was sleepin'
Men be leapin off ledges, when there women leave for the weekend
The human mind's an asylum, dialin' help lines repeatedly
Pushin' garbage down and putting more in so greedily
In the head of irate Babylonians
Everything is what it is, even when it's not

An excess rules everything I do
So tell me how can I be more like you
Cause all of this don't seem to bother you
So tell me how can I be more like you---Lyrics submitted by ethan.
