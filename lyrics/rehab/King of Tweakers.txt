Why do I feel so claustrophobic?
My heart jumpin 
Like I done did aerobics.
Three days pass 
And I barely notice.
Ice, ice baby,
Just cant control it.
Hold it,
I dont think Ive eaten neither.
Alcohol is gonna kill my liver.
Im scared to death.
How did I mettthhh
Up my life
And get short of breath?
Bad checks,
They bounced.
Drained my account.
Listen to the voice 
In my head, announce.
(Man quit this shit!)
Feelin down and out
Tired, but I'm wired.
Got fired about,
A week ago. 
Punched the boss,
In the mouth.
But, I was wrong.
I just wanna belong.
And, I got a pain,
In one of my lungs.
Man, what have I done?
Im still up at the dawn.

*Chorus*
Ive METH'd up,
Royally!
Im the King of Tweakers,
And Im sinkin deeper.
Ive METH'd up,
Everything!
Im the King of Tweakers,
Such an evil creature.

Monkey on my back, 
Done become King Kong.
Stopped at the pawn shop,
My rings gone.
Such a disappointment, 
To mom and dad.
My skin itches.
Crabs,
Grabbin at my nads.
Ive done become,
What Id be laughin at,
Back when I was sober,
With a sack of cash.
Take off the edge,
With a bag of grass.
Walk by the mirror,
Look at the jack ASS!
What did I miss? 
Sick of this abyss.
Diagnosis:
Terminal emptiness.
Grit my teeth,
And clinch my fists.
Hard to love anything,
When you stay pissed,
At yourself.
And, your health
Deteriorates, 
`Cause your face stays down,
On mirrors and plates.
If I let a tear drop,
I get hysterical.  
Im prayin, beggin,
For a miracle.

*Chorus X2* 

I really dont like this anymore!
Why did it have to happen to Danny for?
I did it to myself,
I cant ignore.
I beat myself up, 
Like a dirty whore. 
Help me.
I cant take it anymore.
Thank God,
I hide my four four.
Lordy, lordy
My nervousness is viscous.
Is this a sign?
Is that what this is?
