Bartender I really did it this time. Broke my parole to have a good time. When I got home it was six a.m.  The door was locked so I kicked it in. She was trippin on the bill's I think she was high on some pills. She through my shit out into the yard. Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard. And in my drunken stuper I did what I should have never done, now I'm sittin here talking to you, drunk and on the run. 
I'm sittin at a bar on the inside, waitin for my ride on the outside. She broke my heart in the trailor park so I jacked the keys to her fucking car, crashed that peice of shit, and then stepped away.
You know moe I'll probably get ten years; so just give me beers till they get here. Ya I know the sun is comin up, and ya'll are probably gettin ready for closin up. But I'm tryin to dry my soul, I'm tired of this life on a dirt road. Everything that I love is gone, and I'm tired of hangin on. 
I'm sittin at a bar on the inside, waiting for my ride on the outside. She stole my heart in the trailor park. so I jacked the keys to her fucking car, crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away.
I guess it's meant to be, romance is miserie. So much for memories and now I'm headed to the penitentiary. See me onT.V. the next cop series I am a danger I guess I should of did something about my anger, but I'll never learn. Real things I don't concern. I pour keorcene on everything I love to watch it burn I know it's my fault but I wasn't happy it was over. She through a fit so I crashed that piece of shit nova. And now I'm going back again, back to the pen to see my friends. When we all pile out that county van they'll ask me where i've been i've been at the bar on the inside waitin for my ride on the outside. She broke my heart in the trailor park so I jacked the keys to her fucking car I crashed that peice of shit and stepped away.---Lyrics submitted by kayla.
