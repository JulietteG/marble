I think about, you know life and what it really means,
I drink about it,
I think i'm busting at the seems,
Don't over think it,
I think somebody told me that before,
Yea whatever thats my attitude what can I say,
Evidently I was raised to be this way,
But incidently there's days I really want to change,
If heaven sent me,
Then why do I feel this crazy got a man down mayday mayday,
Bottles and Cans,
Seeds and stems,
Down to my last roach,
Here I am looking,
Caught between tomorrow and yesterday,
Tellin' myself it'll be okay,
Bottles and Cans,
Seeds and Stems,
Will I ever change, guess it all depends, feels like nothin' ever went my way, tellin' myself it'll be okay,
Broken-hearted, I've been listenin' to my head scream,
Got it spark it,
You hear that or is it just me,
What's the matter are you feeling just like me,
Has anybody seen my mind i cant find it,
Life is flyin',
Somebody rewind it, were all dying,
And just runnin' around buyin' it,
I think we've gotten a little too open minded, got a man down, mayday, mayday,
Bottles and Cans,
Seeds and stems,
Down to my last roach,
Here i am lookin', caught between tomorrow and yesterday,
Tellin' myself it'll be okay,
Bottles and Cans,
Seeds and stems,
Will I ever change, guess it all depends,
Feels like nothin ever went my way,
Tellin' myself it'll be okay,
Broke and lonely,
Chokin on dro can I borrow another tommorow dear lord,
I'm scopin' hopin' some door can open,
And my folks don't even know me no more,
My kids are growin' and my age is showin',
One of the seeds I sow gonna sprout i'm not sure,
The doubt and the lure is a couch of valour,
With a mirror and a blade and a pile of inpure,
Bottles and Cans,
Seeds and stems,
Down to my last roach,
Here I am lookin',
Caught between tomorrow and yesterday,
Tellin' myself it'll be okay,
Bottles and Cans,
Seeds and stems,
Will I ever change,
Guess it all depends,
Feels like nothin' ever went my way,
Tellin' myself it'll be okay,
Bottles and Cans,
Seeds and stems,
Down to my last roach,
Here I am lookin',
Caught between tomorrow and yesterday,
Tellin' myself it'll be okay,
Bottles and Cans,
Seeds and stems,
Will I ever change, guess it all depends,
Feels like nothin' ever went my way,
Tellin' myself it'll be okay,
Bottles and Cans.---Lyrics submitted by matt.
