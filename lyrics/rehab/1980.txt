Hey there pretty little girl,
With your long brown sexy curls. 
You a hottie body tight
Good God almighty, ahight! 

Son hold up you need to slow your roll
We been talking for awhile now she ain't no hoe
She got class, style, pazazz and jazz 
Each smile as a matter of fact she has me
Twisted just like she did back then 
When the game of gab wa played among friends 
That's all it was about and now ta represent 
We talked last night around 10 and I told her yo. 

Listen up cause I love you lady 
We go back like 1980, 
Lord knows your the one to change me 
You love me 'cause I'm so crazy 
You'll see it'll be you and me always, always. 

I told her look I know a lot of folks 'round town 
Probably been tellin' you, "Danny just a crook." 
I diffidently did some things that I shouldn't be proud of 
But we can do it by the book, 
We've known eachother for a long time 
I know your a strong kind of woman 
With a strong mind and that's what got me hooked.
I got some crazy homies 
What you talking 'bout you got some crazy homies 
Yo, quit frontin' and lolli gaggin 
We can have a baby daughter 
Maybe call her Maggie, 
We've known eachother since the 9th grade 
We make eachother laugh best friends 
Let's do this the right way!

Listen up cause I love you lady 
We go back like 1980, 
Lord knows your the one to change me 
You love me 'cause I'm so crazy 
You'll see it'll be you and me always, always. 

Listen up cause I love you lady 
We go back like 1980, 
Lord knows your the one to change me 
You love me 'cause I'm so crazy 
You'll see it'll be you and me always, always. 

I know I'm still crazy but I've changed alot, 
And I've cleaned up a little and your still hot 
But if I ain't the one I hope you find true love 
Then I'll be here when push comes to shove
Just know if you walk down that asile 
With another dude to take those vows, how i'll react aint no tellin' 
I might bust in the back of the church and start yellin. 

Listen up cause I love you lady 
We go back like 1980, 
Lord knows your the one to change me 
You love me 'cause I'm so crazy 
You'll see it'll be you and me always, always. 

Listen up cause I love you lady 
We go back like 1980, 
Lord knows your the one to change me 
You love me 'cause I'm so crazy 
You'll see it'll be you and me always, always. 
ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS!!!!!!! ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
