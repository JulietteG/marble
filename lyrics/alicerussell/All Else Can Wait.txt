Oh, oh, oh

So fair
Feelings way off the line
Suffer this together 
And its way off the line
Struggling together 
So much anger so much pain
To realize its all in vain

Slowly to learn
All these thoughts, all these things,
what they all seem to mean.
Will you always remind me
all the places we have seen,
so we may return and start again?

So fair,
loving way over time.
We forced the doors wide open,
and theres nowhere left to hide.
Run the roads together,
not stoping all the way.
The storm is strong,
Oh all else can wait

Oh, oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by Richard Trinkner.
