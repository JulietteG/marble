Verse 1
Been through some hard times looking back on my past
I ran from my mistakes to make good feeling glad
So many chances means that I'm certain of my past
I ran from my mistakes to make good feeling glad

Chorus
What does it mean
Why is it thin
Always so hard to reach my dream
Wondering why
Wherever I try
Cause me to find some kind of peace
(bis)

Verse 2
Been through some hard times looking back on my past
I ran from my mistakes to make good feeling glad
So many chances means that I'm certain of my past
I ran from my mistakes to make good feeling glad

Verse 3
Now moving on word (I trade a certain past ?)
You'll see the reason yet I'm blind to my task
Don't see the answers have stumbled but one fall
I'll face my mistakes to make good feeling glad---Lyrics submitted by Max.
