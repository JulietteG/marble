So I guess it's over, there's nothing left to say. 
Take the ring off my finger, and just call it a day.
Thought we had forever, but that was yesterday.
Your such a liar, wish I saw it on you face.
But you did it so well, could somebody just tell me how.

How can I remeber to for get, when my heart just won't me?
Make myself but love you, tell me that it's not true.
I know all the reasons, but I just can't beleive them.
And pretend we never met. How can I remember to forget.

Wish that I could hate you, so I could let you go.
Wish I never met, the one I want the most.
I could feel an ocean, with all the tears I've cried.
Tell me you were joking, just a dream I had last night.
But I'm wide awake and, I want you so much right now.

How can I remember to forget these emotions and all
the plans we made? Like we never happened, make my heart break and, though it's really over, but I, just don't, know how. 

How can I remember to forget, when my heart just won't let me, make myself but love you, tell me that it's not true.
I know all the reasons but I just can't beleive them. 
And pretend we never met. How can I remember to forget?

Forget, Ohhh---Lyrics submitted by Corjah Henderson.
