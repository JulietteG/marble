Had 'em dressed in their Sunday best calling me dirty words
Had a few drive by shootin' me the bird
Night-stalking me, callin' my phone blowing up
Going all Carrie Underwood on my truck
They get crazy and mean
And everything in between
You can't blame no one else
When you brought it all on yourself

Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you

I've had 'em burn my clothes in a barrel in the front yard
Revenging and binging up my credit cards
Post pictures of me naked with my ink showing through
In the places no one knew there were tattoos

Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you

They go out of their heads
Hell, yeah, they get all red
But you can't blame no one else
When you brought it all on yourself

Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
No telling what she might do
Maybe get half-drunk, half-wild and wanna fight
Keep yelling at you, cussing at you all night
Hell-bent on tearing you something new
When she goes all country on you

Don't tick her off, break her heart, tell her lies
Don't feed her any lipstick alibis
Ain't nothing she can't see through
When she goes all country on you
Come on---
