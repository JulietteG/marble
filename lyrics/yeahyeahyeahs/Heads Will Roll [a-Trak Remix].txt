Off with your head
Dance til youre dead
Heads will roll (4x)
On the floor

Glitter on the west streets
Silver over everything
The rivers all wet
Youre all chrome

Dripping with alchemy
Shiver stop shivering
The glitters all wet
Youre all chrome

The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
(repeat)
Yeah Yeah Yeahs Lyrics on http://www.lyrics-celebrities.anekatips.com/

Off with your head
Dance til youre dead
Heads will roll (4x)
On the floor

You can last
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Realize

Glitter on the west streets
Silver over everything
The glitters all wet
Youre all chrome
Youre all chrome

Oh oh

Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance til youre dead
Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance til youre dead
Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance til youre dead
