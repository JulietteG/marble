Pack up;
Im straight; 
Enough;
Oh say, say, say;
Oh say, say, say;
Oh say, say, say;
Oh say, say, say;
Oh say, say, say 

Wait, they dont love you like I love you;
And wait, they dont love you like I love you;
Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aps;
Wait! They dont love you like I love you.....

Lay off;
Dont stress;
Well, my kind's,your kind;
Ill stay the same!
Pack up;
Dont stray;
Oh say, say, say;
Oh say, say, say!

Wait! They dont love you like I love you;
And wait! They dont love you like I love you;
Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aps;
Wait! They dont love you like I love you!
And wait! They dont love you like I love you!
Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aps!
Wait! They dont love you like I love you 

Wait! They dont love you like I love you;
And wait! They dont love you like I love you;
Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aps;
Wait! They dont love you like I love you!
And wait! They dont love you like I love you!
Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aps!
Wait! They dont love you like I love you...---Lyrics submitted by kyante.
