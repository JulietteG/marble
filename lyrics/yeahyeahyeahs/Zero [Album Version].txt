shake it like a ladder to the sun
makes me feel like a madman on the run
find me never,never far gone
so get your leather,leather,leather,leather 
on on on on
(chorus)
your zero
what's your name?
no one gonna ask you
better find out where they want you to go
try & hit the spot
get to know it in the dark
get to know it whether you're 
crying crying crying oh oh
can you climb climb climb higher

shake it like a ladder to the sun
makes me feel like a madman on the run
find me never never far gone
so get your leather leather leather on on on on

(chorus)

was it the cure? shellshock!
was it the cure? hope not!
was it the cure? shellshock!
was it the cure?
was it the cure?

(chorus)

was it the cure? shellshock!
was it the cure? hope not!
was it the cure? shellshock!
was it the cure? hope not!

what's your name?(x7)---Lyrics submitted by amber.
