Verse 1:
Yeah I'm the centerpiece of the scene
Give em all the spins yeah yeah woah
We go round and round up and down
Carousel of sins yeah yeah woah

Pre-Chorus:
I'm breaking mirrors to reflect the room
Turn the lights out watch me shine for you
At my discotheque a kaleidoscope of lights

Chorus:
I'm gonna take you for the spin of your life
I'm gonna take you for the spin of your life
I'm gonna make you say
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you say
Oh oh oh oh
I'm your disco ball

Verse 2:
It's pushing 2 A.M. stop the spin
Again I'm all alone yeah yeah woah
You know It's lonely at the top
But it's all I've ever known yeah yeah woah

Pre-Chorus:
I'm breaking mirrors to reflect the room
Turn the lights out watch me shine for you
At my discotheque a kaleidoscope of lights

Chorus:
I'm gonna take you for the spin of your life
I'm gonna take you for the spin of your life
I'm gonna make you say
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you say
Oh oh oh oh
I'm your disco ball

End Chorus:
I'm gonna take you for the spin of your life
I'm gonna take you for the spin of your life
I'm gonna make you say
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you say
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

I'm gonna take you for the spin of your life
I'm gonna take you for the spin of your life
I'm gonna make you say
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I'm gonna make you say
Oh oh oh oh
I'm your disco ball.---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Levy.
