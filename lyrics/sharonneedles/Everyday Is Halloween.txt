Verse 1:
I live with snakes and lizards
And other things that go bump in the night
'Cause to me everyday is Halloween
I've given up hiding and started to fight
Yeah I've started to fight
Well any time any place anywhere that I go
All the people seem to stop and stare
They say "Why are you dressed like it's Halloween?
you look so absurd, you look so obscene" Oh

Chorus:
Why can't I live a life for me
Why should I take the abuse that's served
Why can't they see they're just like me
It's the same it's the same in the whole wide world
It's the same it's the same in the whole wide world

Verse 2:
Well I let their teeny minds think
That they're dealing with someone who is over the brink
Well I dress this way just to keep them at bay
'Cause Halloween is every day

Chorus:
Oh, why can't I live a life for me
Why should I take the abuse that's served
Why can't they see they're just like me
It's the same it's the same in the whole wide world
It's the same it's the same in the whole wide world

End Chorus:
Why can't I live a life for me
Why should I take the abuse that's served
Why can't they see they're just like me
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide
Why can't I live a life for me
Why should I take the abuse that's served
Why can't they see they're just like me
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world
The whole wide world
The whole wide world
