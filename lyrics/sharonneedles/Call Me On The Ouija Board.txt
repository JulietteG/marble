Verse 1:
It's just you and me baby.
We're trapped in two different worlds.
Now I know you're no downtown boy, well I'm no uptown girl neither.
We're trapped between two realms you see.
You wanna talk to me?
Well then drop the phone,
And pick up the board.

Prechorus:
I'll be your Carol Anne
I'll be your pentagram
Let's dabble in the black arts
This is not a game
Let me spell my name
Let's keep this in the dark

Chorus:
A-B-C-D-E-F-G
Call me on the Ouija Board
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P
Call me on the Ouija Board
Q-R-S-T-U and I
Call me on the Ouija Board
W-X-Y-and-Z
Call me on the Ouija Board
On the Ouija Board

Verse 2:
Place your fingers on the board
And tell me what you'll do to me.
I will spell a fantasy
And cast a spell of ecstasy.
A little touch of magic
In this world obsessed with science.

Prechorus:
I'll be your Carol Anne
I'll be your pentagram
Let's dabble in the black arts
This is not a game
Let me spell my name
Let's keep this in the dark

Chorus:
A-B-C-D-E-F-G
Call me on the Ouija Board
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P
Call me on the Ouija Board
Q-R-S-T-U and I
Call me on the Ouija Board
W-X-Y-and-Z
Call me on the Ouija Board
On the Ouija Board

C-Section:
Maybe yes and maybe no
We don't need no telephone
Maybe yes and maybe no
Let's see where this goes
Maybe yes and maybe no
We don't need no telephone
Maybe yes and maybe no
Let's see where this goes

Chorus:
A-B-C-D-E-F-G
Call me on the Ouija Board
H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P
Call me on the Ouija Board
Q-R-S-T-U and I
Call me on the Ouija Board
W-X-Y-and-Z
Call me on the Ouija Board
On the Ouija Board
Goodbye
G-g-g-g-goodbye
Goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Levy.
