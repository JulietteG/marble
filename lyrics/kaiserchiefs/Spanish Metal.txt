How could we not notice it before?
well you may as well have pinned it to my door
well lately I'm oh so slowly coming around
to the fat that this friend is a friend no more

and if you think you're right then you are wrong
no one ever really knew what's going on
now we're all so slowly coming around
and this friend of a friend was no friend all along

the penny drops from the top of tour eiffel
through the boulevards to taj mahal

a penny more through the floor of sacre coeur
from the spanish mane to the yorkshire moors---Lyrics submitted by judit.
