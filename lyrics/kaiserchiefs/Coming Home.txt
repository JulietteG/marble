Do you wish you hadn't stayed all night?
Do you wish you hadn't gotten so high?
Do you wish you hadn't come?
Oh no...
Gotta go...

Do you wish it wasn't half past gone?
Do you wish you didn't last that long?
Do you wish you hadn't come?
Oh no...
Gotta go...
Gotta run...

[Bridge]
May I remind you,
May I remind that you've got nowhere to go,
So I'm staying beside you,
I'm staying beside you 'til you find a way back home..

[Chorus:]
We're coming home,
We're coming home,
Light a fire
We're coming home.
We'll write it down,
We'll write it all down

And we're dancing on the finest line,
Between the chance of the time of our lives,
Wishing you were done, oh no, gotta run...

And we're choosing not to make that choice,
And we lose our shoes and voice,
But we have a lot of fun on the way, you wanna play?
You gotta come!

[Bridge]
May I remind you,
May I remind that you've got no where to go,
So I'm staying beside you,
Staying beside you 'til you find a way back home

[Chorus: x2]
We're coming home,
We're coming home,
Light a fire
We're coming home.
We'll write it down,
We'll write it all down

Then it all comes flooding back to me,
Like a forgotten melody from a dream
Then it all comes flooding back to me,
Like a forgotten melody from a dream
Then it all comes flooding back to me,
Like a forgotten melody

[Chorus: x2]
We're coming home,
We're coming home,
Light a fire
We're coming home.
We'll write it down,
We'll write it all down ---
