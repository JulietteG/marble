That was then but this is now
What's really changed?
Black is black and white's still white
And gray is a waste
I'll come back to my home town
And I'll see her again
Now I fall to her eyes
I'll see you on the way down

She's got me falling, ayo
She's got me crawling, ayo
She's got me falling, ayo
Falling awake

Pick it up, put it away
I'll never find it again
I would like to take you back
I'll see you at the haystack
Like the scene from the wild west
Firing off a salute
I hit the drug(?), clutching my chest
I'll see you on the way down

I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling awake
You got me falling awake
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling awake
You got me falling awake---
