Hold onto your hearts, if you can!
It's been the coldest year since records began
And now the sun is coming up again in no man's land

So let's go, into tomorrow
Together fighting
We're bows and arrows!

[Chorus:]
You and me on the front line
You and me, every time
It's always you and me, we're bows and arrows
You!

Well I'm not waiting for no one, I'm waiting for you!
Well I'm not waiting for no one, I'm waiting for you!
It takes the two of us to gather up, we'll make it through!

So let's go, into tomorrow
Together fighting
We're bows and arrows!

[Chorus:]
You and me on the front line
You and me, every time
It's always you and me, we're bows and arrows
You!
You and me when the sun goes down
It's always you and me when the whip comes round
It's always you and me, we're bows and arrows
You!

We the people, created equal
We the people, created equal
We the people, created equal
We the people, created equal
We the people, created equal
We the people, created equal
We the people, created equal
We the people, created equal
We the people, created equal
And if that's true then we're not the only ones
And if that's true then we're not the only ones
And if that's true then we're not the only ones
And if that's true then we're not the only ones

[Chorus x2]---
