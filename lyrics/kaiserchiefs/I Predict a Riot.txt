watching the people get lairy
is not very pretty I tell thee
walking through town is quite scary
and not very sensible either

a friend of a friend he got beaten
he looked the wrong way at a policeman
would never have happened to Smeaton
The old Leodienson

la ah ah la la lalala la
ah ah ah la la lalala la
I predict a riot I predict a riot I predict a riot I predict a riot

I tried to get in my taxi
a man in a tracksuit attacked me
he said that he saw it before me
wants to get things a bit gory
girls scrabble round with no clothes on
to borrow a pound for a condom
if it wasn't for the chip fat they'd be frozen
they're not very sensible

la ah ah la la lalala la
ah ah ah la la lalala la
I predict a riot I predict a riot I predict a riot I predict a riot

And if there's anybody left in here 
that doesn't want to be out there

watching the people get lairy
is not very pretty I tell thee
walking through town is quite scary
and not very sensible

la ah ah la la lalala la
ah ah ah la la lalala la
I predict a riot I predict a riot I predict a riot I predict a riot

and if there's anybody left in here
that doesn't want to be out there

I predict a riot I predict a riot I predict a riot I predict a riot---Lyrics submitted by Theresa.
