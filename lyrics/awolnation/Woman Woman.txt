Last night I fell apart
Broke from my swollen heart
Born in a simple time
Raised with a simple mind

You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman

I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman (oooooh)
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman,woman
Woman

You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman

Last night I fell apart
Choked on my drunken heart

I maybe worthless without you
I'll never decide never to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman
I may be worthless without you
I'll never decide never to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman
Woman.

You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman
You
(Ah-ah-ah)

Who's that woman, woman
Is that woman, woman
Be my woman, woman
Won't you see me in the dark

Who's that woman, woman
Is that woman, woman
Be my woman, woman
Won't you see me in the dark

I maybe worthless without you
I'll never decide to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman (ooooh)
I maybe worthless without you
I'll never to replace you
Amen, the worst is behind us now
Woman, woman
Woman, woman

You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman
You maybe a natural woman---
