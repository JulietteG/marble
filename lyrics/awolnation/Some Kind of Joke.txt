This day feels anything but difficult
Woke up choking on a miracle
I don't know why [x3]
I don't know why [x3]
My teacher told me what I'm made for
I beg to differ in the outcome
I don't know why [x3]
I don't know why [x3]

There's nowhere to run
When you're hiding from the truth
It's some kind of joke
When the tears are bleeding through
Looking glass fire
When the pain is caused by you
It's some kind of joke [x2]

Ooww yeah oww yeah
I'm almost done with all my secrets
I'll take my time to fake a deep breath
I don't know why [x3]
I don't know why [x3]
There's nowhere to run
When you're hiding from the truth
It's some kind of joke
When the tears are bleeding through
Looking glass fire
When the pain is caused by you
It's some kind of joke [x2]

Ah, wait a minute
In a room full of red pretend to be done
We fall on our face pretend to be gone
In a room full of red pretend to be done
We fall on our face pretend to be gone

Nowhere to run [screaming]
when you're hiding from the truth
It's some kind of joke [screaming]
when the tears are bleeding through
Aw look at that fire
Aw when the pain is caused by you
Sometimes we chock
And sometimes we chock

SING
SING
ALRIGHT
SING WITH ME
Sometimes we chock [x2]
[Scream]---
