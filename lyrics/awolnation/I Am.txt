These friends of mine will come and go
I'm the first to leave, the last to know
I'll be swimming in a face of flames
For these friends of mine don't know my pain
And I guess I wanted, I guess I wanted
I just want you to know

All of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
And I am only looking on it with my hands down

All of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
And I am only looking on it with my hands down

Things are glistening
So thanks a lot for listening
I guess I wanted
And I guess I wanted
I just want you to know

All of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
And I am only looking on it with my hands down
All these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
And I am only looking on it with my hands down

I guess I wanted
I guess I wanted
I just want you to know

Yeah, yeah
Someone left the lights on
Yeah, yeah
Ooo, someone left the lights on
Yeah, yeah
Ooo, someone left the lights on

All of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
And I am only looking on it with my hands down

All of these things made me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
Maybe, all of these things make me who I am
And I am only looking on it with my hands down

I guess I wanted
I guess I wanted
I just want you to know---
