I will fall asleep tonight
Against the will of the world
Because peace is not a gift
Nor a feeling
A feeling I deserve

Still it comes to me each night
Despite, a war inside our heads
And a sea between our bodies
Cold and old, inside this bed

And you were the mother to my love
But I grew up a runaway
When I was drowning in the storm
You reached out and pulled me ashore
Oh no, oh no, oh no...

And I will wake tomorrow
My arms dead by my side 
And if I wrap them around you
I'll wrap the truth in a lie

Because we both know the evil
The elephant
In our tomb
So let's just be lions for the cub in the other room

And I was the killer of your heart
But you thought it best to stay
When I left you drowning in the rain
Though I'll try
I'll never know your pain, Oh no..........---Lyrics submitted by Maria Melii.
