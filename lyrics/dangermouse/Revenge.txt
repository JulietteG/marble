Pain
I guess it's a matter of sensation
But somehow
You have a way of avoiding it all

In my mind
I have shot you and stabbed you through your heart
I just didn't understand
The ricochet is the second part

'Cause you can't hide
What you intend
It glows in the dark
Once you've sought
The path of revenge
There's no way to stop
And the more I try to hurt you
The more that it hurts me

Strange
It seems like a character mutation
Though I have all the means 
Of bringing you fuckers down
I can't make myself
To destroy upon command
Somehow forgiveness 
lets the evil make the laws

No, you can't hide
What you intend
It glows in the dark
Once we've become 
The thing we dread
There's no way to stop
And the more I try to hurt you
The more it backfires
The more it backfires
The more that it backfires---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
