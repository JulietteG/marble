I cry for the love in your eyes,
and I try to let you be free

If you're blue,
don't let it worry you,
we'll make it through
and if you don't believe me

Faith will come humbly down,
fear will come tumbling down
faith will come humbly down,
fear will come tumbling down

Cynics may fill the books,
critics may give you looks,
but i'll stand by you 'til you die
and i'll be wise in the afterlife

Faith will come humbly down
fear will come tumbling down
faith will come humbly down
fear will come tumbling down---Lyrics submitted by Ada Melo.
