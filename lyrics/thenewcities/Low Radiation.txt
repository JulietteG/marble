I curse this day
while you take over my time
not led astray, I hope you will change your mind
to realize we're blinded by
something you've said
are you tricked by your own lies?

Let's forget the mistakes we've made, cause time is passing by
enjoy the rest of your time with me, it's free but worth the price
we know, we can, hold on to all these things we had
don't think, don't doubt, it's early, let's just give it a try

don't follow me in this vacant mystery
now can't you see, there's no point in feeling down
so realize you shouldn't hide
resist your mind and leave the rest behind

now you care cause now you see (hold on)
and know you can if you really wanna make it
now you care cause now you see (hold on)
and know you can if you really wanna make it

let's forget the mistakes we've made cause time is passing by
enjoy the rest of your time with me, it's free but worth the price
we know, we can, hold on to all these things we had
don't think, don't doubt, it's early, let's just give it a try
cause time's still passing by---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
