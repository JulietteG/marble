I cannot forget those days heavy like my feet were stuck in
concrete locked into a life-delay where everything I'd see was blind ambition
just when this story seems to end
our world expands and then extends 
even if my words are faint you will always hear me say...

tell me more, tell me more why keep moving ahead when we both know
it's no way to go tell me have we become the leaders of the misled in the end?

let's hold on and take a breath take a step away and break transmission
we've walked into another mess cause I can never turn down propositions
just when our story seems to end you've gone and done it all again
and even if my words are faint you will always hear me say...

is this a chain of reaction? let's not fight it...

is this a chain reaction? let's not fight it 
this game is taking over, can't control it
let it go, we both know intentions are never quite what they seem
what can we lose? what can we gain?
lying to ourselves makes it easy to explain
what's there to prove? it's all the same
living in a past that you know will never last
you will always hear me say...---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
