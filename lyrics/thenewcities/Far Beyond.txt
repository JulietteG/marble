Black clouds over me, I'm paranoid
I can't shake the ground beneath my feet
stick in between the right and wrong
way of admitting my defeat
so much confusion, disillusion
of what we're supposes to be
there's no solution
it's the point of view we're all
too blind to see

all by myself I'm on my way
I'll never surrender
far beyond where all ambition's locked away

corruption in the streets, I'm terrified
the cracks in the windows are losing heat
so much I've seen the more I try
it keeps getting harder to believe
so much confusion, disillusion
of what we're supposed to be
we can't stop the motion with this notion
we're so used to living with

when did we become ashamed of what we've done
just like a loaded gun we've got the power
we'll fight back in anger

we're falling in deeper
deeper and deeper
we'll fight back in anger

all by myself I'm on my way, I'll never surrender
far beyond, where all ambition's locked away
all by myself, I'm on my way, I'll never surrender
far beyond is where my passion hides away---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
