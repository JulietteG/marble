Let's see how it feels
so tough to stick to what you've earned
what you believe in (what do you believe in?)
no matter what they say

you better board the right ship
cause sinking has never been so easy
like a stone in this sea of strangers

this time you better whatch out
out of the line, I won't be pushed around
cause there is one too many lessons
and far too many ways to learn
we'll make it make sense

let's see how it feels...
doing the dance to prove them wrong
is this even real? no doubt
it's bound to hit the ground

you better board the right ship
cause sinking has never been so easy
like a stone in this sea of strangers

can't you see that everything's wrong
time has come for us to move on
here's our chance to take it back
spread attack and make this world our own
I'll stick around and solve the problem
only now the clock is ticking 
out of time and out of breath
I'm out of breath but drowning won't take me away
let's see how it feels...---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
