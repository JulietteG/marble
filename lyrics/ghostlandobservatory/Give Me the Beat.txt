I'm strutting down the boulevard
I stop and grab a drink
The pusher man comes sliding up
Says 'Boy, got what you need'
I got ups and I got downs
The whites and the greens
Do you toke up? Do you smoke?
I said 'Man, that ain't for me'

Just give me the beat
That's all I need
(x2)

Bout that time, a Cadillac
Comes bumping down the street
Hits it's brakes and pops the trunk
Says 'This you got to see'
I got chains and diamond rings
8-tracks and LP's
Do you like my merchandise
Said 'Still, that ain't for me'

Just give me the beat
That's all I need
(x2)

He throws his cape around my back
Says 'Kid, just come with me'
You haven't seen my stable yet
Got every kind of breed
Step inside and meet the girls
Sheila and Janine
Legs for days, they go both ways
'Still, that ain't for me'

Just give me the beat
That's all I need
(x2)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
