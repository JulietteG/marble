Haha, It's Madcon, Ye-ea-ea-eah, Wo-o-o-oo
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me

It was early in the mornin'
I hear the shower runnin
I almost can't remember who this girl might be
And then she came back, I couldn't believe my eyes
This pretty young thang with her eyes on me
I know you like it when I put my hands like that
Whisper in your ear, tell me how you like that
Gettin' Freaky-eaky that's what I do best
So come a little closer, come a little closer

No ones gonna do you as freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me, No-oone
No ones gonna do you as freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me No-onee

No-onee

I'm feeling up her thighs
I'm running down her curves
I hear my kitty purr as she laid on me
We windin' and grindin', I (inaudible) advising
Baby like a fire burning all around me
I know you like it when I put my hands like that
Whisper in your ear, tell me how you like that
Gettin' Freaky-eaky that's what I do best
So come a little closer, come a little closer
No ones gonna do you as freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me, no-oneee
No ones gonna do you as freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me, no-oneee
Shawty, know I never ever ever could do
Do you as good as freaky as I do
Shawty, know I never ever ever could do
Do you as good as freaky as I do

You got me going crazy when you do me like that
Your freaky-eaky got me hooked your ridin track
Everytime you leave I wanna put you right back
Come back, I need that, no one can freak me like that
Mira, Madcon, Ey, no one can freak me like that, Come on

No ones gonna do you as freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me, no-oneee
No ones gonna do you as freaky like me, freaky like me, freaky like
Freaky like me, Freaky like me, Freaky like me-me-me no-oneee

Freaky, like me-me-me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
