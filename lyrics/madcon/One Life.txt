Its Madcon, Kelly Rowland
Living one life
Youre only getting one life, so live it up (One Life)
All you get is one life, so live it up (One Life)

Don't let nobody tell you otherwise
(Listen to your heart)
And let your dreams fly
(Never give it up, up, up)
And even when you fuck it up and give another try
(Never give it up, up, up)
You gotta beat it
(And when it rains it pours, just stay the course)
Yeah, and even when you think nobody cares
You gotta believe it gets better

[Kelly Rowland]
When nothings gone right
And the light just won't brighten up
You got nothing left in your fight
Don't you give it up, yeah

[Madcon (Kelly Rowland)]
Nobody's gonna hold me down (me down)
You gotta understand we only have one life (one life)
We only have one life (one life)
I keep my feet up on the ground, the ground
I gotta realize we only have one life (one life)
We only have one life (one life)
We're gonna make it
(We're gonna make it)
Yes we've gotta make it work
(Yes we've gotta make it work)
We're gonna make it
(We're gonna make it)
Yes we've gotta make it work
(Yes we've gotta make it work)

Ah yeah
While looking at the old me
And thinking back on stuff that all my teachers told me
You know it put that fire in my eyes
And though I'm blind to the future
I'mma do it 'cause I owe me
You know, this grind is my religion
Got tired of modest living
Survival was my upbringing
And my sky it has no limit
My time is all I'm giving

[Kelly Rowland]
When nothings gone right
And the light just won't brighten up
You got nothing left in your fight
Don't you give it up, yeah

[Madcon (Kelly Rowland)]
Nobody's gonna hold me down (me down)
You gotta understand we only have one life (one life)
We only have one life (we only have one life) (one life)
I keep my feet up on the ground (the ground)
I gotta realize we only have one life (we only have one life)
We only have one life (we only have one life)
We're gonna make it
(We're gonna make it)
Yes we've gotta make it work
(Yes we've gotta make it work)
We're gonna make it
(We're gonna make it)
Yes we've gotta make it work
(Yes we've gotta make it work)
