It seems to be the truth. (Seems to be the truth)
I guess she cheated on me too. (Cheated on me too)
She really got me good. (Really got me good)
I said she really got me good. (Really got me good)

Youre the first thing I would choose,
but the last thing I need.
Girl Im stuck on you,
its so hard to set me free.
Youre the first thing I would choose,
but the last thing I need.
Youre a liar.
Liar.

Youre the first thing I would choose,
but the last thing I need.
Girl Im stuck on you,
its so hard to set me free.
Youre the first thing I would choose,
but the last thing I need.
cause youre a liar.
Liar.

(The first thing Id choose, the last thing I need)
