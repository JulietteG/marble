I was dreaming of war
Saw that I wouldnt die
Was dreaming of choice
That my ship would fight
I was dreaming because
It made me feel so alive
Was dreaming it all
From my bed last night

You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, were staying young, yeah

Were gonna live, were gonna live forever

This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
Were gonna live, were gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
Were gonna live, were gonna live forever

I was feeling a storm,
But it wasnt outside
Was feeling a force
Im electrified
I was feeling my heart
There was thunder inside
Was feeling it all
From my bed last night

You will be my only one
Hold my hand so we can run
You and I, were staying young, yeah

Were gonna live, were gonna live forever

This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
Were gonna live, were gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
Were gonna live, were gonna live forever

All the things that I dont know
All the dreams that Ive been shown
All the ways that [?]
Tonight close your eyes

Were gonna live, were gonna live forever

This time, I want it all
I want it right now, feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
Were gonna live, were gonna live forever
This time, I want it all
I want it right now, wanna feel the fall
Go, go crazy, go, go, go crazy
Were gonna live, were gonna live forever---
