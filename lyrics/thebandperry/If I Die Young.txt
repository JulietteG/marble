If I die young bury me in satin 
lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh uh oh
Lord, make me a rainbow shine down on my mother
Shell know Im safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oooh and life aint always what you think it ought to be noo
Aint even gray but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well Ive had just enough time

If I die young bury me in satin 
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well Ive had just enough time

Ill be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
Im as clean as the ring on my little cold finger
Ive never known the lovin of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin my hand
Theres a boy here in town says hell love me forever
Who wouldve thought that forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well Ive had just enough time

So put on your best boys and Ill wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts Oh no Ill sell them for a dollar
Theyre worth so much more after Im a goner
And then maybe then youll hear the words Ive been singin
Funny when youre dead how people start listenin

If I die young bury me in satin 
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears keep em in your pocket
Save them for a time when your really gonna need them Oh
The sharp knife of a short life
Well Ive had just enough time
So put on your best boys and Ill wear my pearls
