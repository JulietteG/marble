I was meant to be by your side
And I have waited here for a long time
For you to turn around and notice me
But now you're here holding hands with me

Walk me down the middle of the county fair
walk me down the middle like you don't care
Walk me by the ferris wheel
And make sure that she sees
Let the whole world know you belong to me

I have heard about your bitter end
About how she stold your heart and 
Put it back again
Well i may not be the prettiest girl around
But I sure am a sight for sore, sore eyes

Walk me down the middle of Main Street,
Walk me down the where the whole town will be
I don't need no parade
But make sure that she sees
Let the whole world know you belong to me

I'd walk through fire for you
Walk through barbed wire for you
I'd walk for miles, its true
Just to be with you

If you walk me down the middle of my
momma's church
Walk me down that aisle in your finest shirt
Let the whole world know you will walk me down 
the middle of the county fair
walk me down the middle like you don't care
Walk me by the ferris wheel
And make sure they all see
Let the whole world know
You belong to me---Lyrics submitted by Aly Craig.
