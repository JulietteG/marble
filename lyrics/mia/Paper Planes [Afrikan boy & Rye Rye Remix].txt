I fly high like paper ,Get high like planes if you catch me at the border I got visas in my name if you come around hey! I make um all day ,I get one down in a second if u wait . cause somtimes I think sittin on trains everywere i go im clocking that game ,everyones a winner now we making that fame ,bon-a-fide hustlers just making my name (this 1 more time) pirate skulls and bones , sticks and stones and weeds .runnin when we hit um lethal poison for the system---Lyrics submitted by GABY.
