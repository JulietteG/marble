Jimmy, Jimmy
Come back Jimmy

When you go Rwanda Congo
Take me on ya genocide tour
Take me on a truck to Darfur
Take me where you would go

Got static on ya satellite phone
Got to get you safe at home
Got to get you some where warm
So you get me all alone

Jimmy Aaja

Time and time and time and time again
You keep pushing that button but I don't know what your sayin
You hit me on AIM tryin' flip me on some game
Are you coming are you going are you leaving are you staying

You told me that your busy
Your loving makes me crazy
I know that you hear me
Start acting like you want me

You told me that your busy
Your loving makes me crazy
I know you can hear me
Start acting like you want me

Time and time and time and time again
You keep pushing me, what you sayin
You hit me on AIM, flip me on some game
But I still don't know what you're sayin'

You told me that your busy
Your loving makes me crazy
I know that you hear me
Start acting like you want me

You told me that your busy
Your loving makes me crazy
I know you can hear me
Start acting like you want me
