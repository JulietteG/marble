Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
[x2]

My chain hits my chest
When Im banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When Im banging on the radio

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Dont go screaming if I blow you with a bang

Suki Zuki
Im coming in the Cherokee gasoline
Theres steam on the window screen
Take it, take it
Wheels bouncing like a trampoline
When I get to where Im going, gonna have you trembling

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
[x2]

My chain hits my chest
When Im banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When Im banging on the radio

Yeah back it, back it
Yeah pull up to the bumper game
Yeah with a signal
Cover me, cause Im changing lanes

Had a handle on it
My life, I broke it
When I get to where Im going, gonna have you saying it

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
[x2]

My chain hits my chest
When Im banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When Im banging on the radio
[x2]

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Dont go screaming if I blow you with a bang---
