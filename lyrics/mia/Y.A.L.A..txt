YALA
YALA

(Chorus x2)
Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo
A banana pole
Like youre goin up a yoyo

Yea yea, YALA
Yea yea, YALA

So the dance go off when I enter the building
So the dance go off when I enter the building

YALA
YALA
YALA
YALA

I dream some hancho came in my poncho
Run out like Castro
Blow up and get go

Pullin a cinco
Great like Canaveral
They love when Ill go
Hard like Im death row

Weighin kilo
Lies a pillow
Dont tell my tic-toe
Look how them buns go

(Pre-Chorus)
Come come come
When we comin some some
Yea a glass around
Yea I got me some pom pom
For fun for fun
Yea its getting undone
Weve been here, we move on
Its been so long since we hung

(Chorus x2)
Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo
A banana pole
Like youre goin up a yoyo

YALA
YALA

Empty wowo
And I am understood
I get the lolo
Searching for me unfold

Bankin offshore,
Got a trip to Singapore
And it could end like
Im doin the animal

For the oracle
Dont run the igno
Thats why I say shit
So they can explore

My baby, I am more
My mommy I adore
I take you stay and play
Cant take it anymore

(Pre-Chorus)
Come come come
When we comin some some
Yea a glass around
Yea I got me some pom pom
For fun for fun
Yea its getting undone
Weve been here, we move on
Its been so long since we hung

(Chorus x2)
Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo
A banana pole
Like youre goin up a yoyo

Yea yea, yo yo
Yea yea, yo yo
So the dance go off when I enter the building

YALA
YALA
YALA

(x2)
YALA, YALA
Im really so YALA
You can take a photo
Imma keep it wowo

YALA
YALA

(Pre-Chorus)
Come come come
When we comin some some
Yea a glass around
Yea I got me some pom pom
For fun for fun
Yea its getting undone
Weve been here, we move on
Its been so long since we hung

(Chorus x2)
Go low, go Shawty
Run like a polo
A banana pole
Like youre goin up a yoyo

YOLO?
I dont even know anymore
What that even mean though
If you only live once why we keep doing the same shit?
Back home where I come from we keep being born again and again and then again and again
Thats why they invented karma---
