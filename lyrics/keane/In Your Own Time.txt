You've got nowhere to go
Got no way out of this hole
Got no one to say it's all 
just the way things are
Wouldn't it be good
To look into a brighter day
It's just the way things are

In your own time
There's no map to guide our way
So I say nothing, you say nothing
In your own way
Thought I could help you find your place
But I'm as lost as you are lost these days
Oh wouldn't it be fine
To close your eyes and see something
Something more than this

In your own time
There's no map to guide our way
So I say nothing, you say nothing
In your own way
Thought I could help you find your place
But I'm as lost as you are lost
It's not the way

Things are going to change, you know
The battles you have fought 
won't go to waste, you know
The things are gonna change,
It just takes time

In your own time
There's no map to guide our way
So I say nothing, you say nothing
In your own way
Thought I could help you find your place
But I'm as lost as you are lost
It's just the way
It's just the way
It's just the way
It's just the way---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
