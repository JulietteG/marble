I dreamed I was drowning
in the river Thames
I dreamed I had nothing at all
nothing but my own skin

I dream i was drifting 
On a hawlling wind
I dream i had nothing at all
nothing but my own skin


Slipped away from your open hand
into the river
Saw your face looking back at me
I saw my past
and I saw my future

You take the pieces of the dreams that you have
cause you don't like the way they seem to be going
You cut them up and spread them out on the floor
You're full of hope as you begin rearranging
Put it all back together
but anyway you look at things and try
The lovers are losing

I dreamed I was watching
a young lover's dance
I reached out to touch your hand
but I was watching from a distance

We cling to love like a skidding car
clinched to the corner
I try to hold on to what we are
the more I squeeze the quicker we all are

You take the pieces of the dreams that you have
cause you don't like the way they seem to be going
You cut them up and spread them out on the floor
you're full of hope as you begin rearranging
Put it all back together
but anyway you look at things and try
The lovers are losing

I dreamed I had nothing at all (nothing at all)
I dreamed I had nothing at all

You take the pieces of the dreams that you have
cause you don't like the way they seem to be going
You cut them up and spread them out on the floor
You're full of hope as you begin rearranging
Put it all back together
but in the final reckoning
We're trying
The lovers are losing---Lyrics submitted by Ruby.
