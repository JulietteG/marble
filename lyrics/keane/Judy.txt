First sign of trouble on the double you got
cryin' like a baby all alone,
Five minutes later elevator brings you here
and you want a kid of your own.
Whats hap'ning in your mind?
Youre getting harder to find.
Spinning around and round.
Can't you just calm down?
(Chorus)
Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy, slow down.
Youre gonna break up on your wild
merrygo-round.
Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy, slow down.
Judy, Judy, woh!
You cant be trusted cause youre dusted
ev'ry night of the week.
Goin' out of your head.
In the confusion an illusion lights your eyes
and you
Forget all that l've said.
You just learned how to drive.
I wanna stay alive.
Give me the keys and we|l go.
You say yes, yes, yes, yes, No!
(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by tac.
