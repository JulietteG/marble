You've been watching dawn from the gutter
Trading one bad move for another
It's been a stormy night but it's almost through

Friends you once loved don't know you
Even your own eyes don't know you
You think this whole world's trying to bury you
But it's not true

So don't you say
There's something in your core that can't be saved
Cause it's not true
And every atom of my heart is missing you

Well it's OK to be scared when
You're stuck behind a door that won't open
The shadows in your dreams that are chasing you
They're not true

So don't you say
There's something in your core that can't be saved
Cause it's not true
And every atom of my heart is missing you

The good will come through
I wish that you could feel it the way you used to
I wish you could believe it the way you used to
The way you used to---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
