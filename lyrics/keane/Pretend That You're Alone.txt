We are just the monkeys who fell out of the trees
We are blisters on the earth
We are not the flowers, we're the strangling weeds in the meadow
And love is just our way of looking out for ourselves
When we don't want to live alone
So step into the vacuum, tear off your clothes and be born again

Pretend that you're alone now and everything's gone
Just animal reflexes no one looking on
Forget about fashion, forget about the law
Pretend that you're alone now

I wonder what I'd do if I could wake up every morning
With a clean slate
I'd burn through the cities and tear through the towns
'Cause there's no deals to make
So break out of the cages, the delicate structures
We cling to all our lives
'Cause we are just the monkeys who fell out of the trees
When we were trying to fly

Pretend that you're alone now and everything's gone
Just primal desire, no right and no wrong
Forget about the future, forget about blame
Pretend that you're alone now
Pretend that you're alone now

She's not waiting for tomorrow
And she has no love in her eyes

Oh no, I wanna come down right now
Pull over, I wanna get out right now

Ooh ooh!

Pretend that you're alone now and everything's gone
Just animal reflexes no one looking on
Forget about religion, forget about shame
Pretend that you're alone now

No numbers in your phone now there's nothing going on
Just primal desire, no right and no wrong
Forget about fashion, forget about fame
Pretend that you're alone now
Pretend that you're alone now
Pretend that you're alone now

Do do do do...---Lyrics submitted by JOHN.
