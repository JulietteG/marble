Hot and wet I sweat, when I watch the way
you walk.
And I heard dirty words, tell me who taught
you to talk.
Who? When?
Go straight to your room!
Yeah! Yeah!
You gonna get it soon!

(Chorus)

Bad little baby girl,
Youre messin' up my world.
Bad little baby girl,
My little precious girl.
I love you, It's true, even though youre only
a child.
Now go to your room, 'cause youre warm
and wicked, driving
Me wild,
Go! Now!
I gave you my command,
Yeah! Yeah!
Don't make me use my hand.

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by tac.
