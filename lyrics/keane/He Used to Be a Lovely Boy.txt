Time to leave this town
Now your dreams have all let you down.
No one here will  miss you now,
Time to wake up and look around.

He used to be a lovely boy, lovely boy,
lovely boy.
He  used to be a lovely boy.

Turn away and turn ahead.
Just a hopeless dreamer, she said.
Eyes of cloud and feet of lead,
Find a shore that needs you instead.

He used to be a lovely boy, lovely boy,
Lovely boy.
He used to be a lovely boy.
Time on your hands, world at your feet,
no adventure left incomplete.

La ra la la la la ra la la la la la la 

Find a place where you can hide
From the love that  holds you inside.
Time's so unkind, 
Like an old friend leaves you behind.

He used to be a lovely boy, lovely boy,
lovely boy.
He used to be a lovely boy.
Time on your hands . . .---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
