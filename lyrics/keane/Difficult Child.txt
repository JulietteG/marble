Baby, I've been travelling so long
Searching for the things for which you ask,
Trying to make you think I could become
The things you want

Baby I've been working so hard
Scratching in the dirt and in the fire
Begging for the beautiful life
That you require

I know I'm like a difficult child
Screaming through the night
So, help me find the light
Without you I'm a broken down car
Rusting in the yard,
Still waiting for the part

Now finally I'm back in our road,
Crunching on the shingle in the drive,
Hungry for your love as I return,
But there's no sign

I know I'm like a difficult child
Screaming through the night
So, help me find the light
Without you I'm a broken down car
Rusting in the yard,
Still waiting for the part

I thought that you'd be waiting like a soldier's queen,
Gazing from your window, holding out for me
What a fool I've been again.

I know I'm like a difficult child
Screaming through the night
So, help me find the light
Without you I'm a broken down car
Rusting in the yard,
Still waiting for the part---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
