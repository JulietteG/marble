Well, you could write it in the dirt girl
Write it on a ten pound note
Everything that I have learned so far
Nothing's worth knowing till you know your part.

Times are getting leaner
If ever you were on my side
Oh, how I wish that you were stood here now
Leading me to shelter when the night comes down.

"Baby", you said, "We're not ever gonna go home."
And "Baby, will you run with me wherever I go?"

Well, it's the pressure of the year girl
Burning little holes in love
Till we make every little thing so hard
Nothing comes easy to a cage-like heart.

Now the light is failing
If ever you were at my side
Then, love I need you to be stood there now
Down to the wire where the bad ones go.

"Baby", you said, "We're not ever gonna go home."
And "Baby, will you run  with me wherever I go?"
Well, maybe these words never really mattered at all
but lately those words run with me wherever I go.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

"Baby", you said, "We're not ever gonna go home."
And "Baby, will you run  with me wherever I go?"
"Baby", you said, "We're not ever gonna go home."
And "Baby, will you run  with me wherever I go?"---Lyrics submitted by Vesna Savic.
