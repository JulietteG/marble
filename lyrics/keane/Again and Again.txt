Was it all in real time or was it  just in my mind ?
Was I just a ghost passing through you
Clinging to the wreckage, till I got the message?
Hanging at the edge of the room

Give me something thats real
Give me half of your bitterest pill
Something from under the surface you actually feel

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
It was in your eyes, in your eyes
They were just easy lies

The little words are heavy and promises are easy
And no ones ever happy or sad for very long
Well just because I said it, it doesnt mean I meant it
I guess that was the way all along

Im just shaping the sound
Im just turning the syllables round
Dipping my toe in the water and watching you drown

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
It was in my eyes, in my eyes
They were just easy lies

And weve been a long time waiting
And its been a lifetime in the making

We said, "When you are alone and afraid
I will come to your aid"
Well was it just a dream, just a dream ?
Because it was real to me

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
We say these words again and again
And again and again---Lyrics submitted by Lari.
