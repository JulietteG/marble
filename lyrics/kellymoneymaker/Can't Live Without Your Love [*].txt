Sometimes I wonder how I ever got along
Without you
You're the best part of it all
Life is only as good as you make me feel
 I need you to hold me for a while
I can't live with your love
I'd be so lonely without you
I'd be nothing without you, baby
I can't live without your love

When the world casts a shadow
And I'm feeling so low
You are there
You have a way about you that makes it all seem right

I need you to hold me for a while
I can't live with your love
I'd be so lonely without you
I'd be nothing without you, baby
I can't live without your love

After all we've been through
You know I'll always love you
I want to share my life with my best friend
And I can't live without your love

 No, I can't live without your love
I'd be so lonely without you
I'd be nothing without you, baby
I can't live without your love
I'd be so lonely without you
I'd be nothing without you, baby
I can't live without your love
No, I can't live without your love
oh oooh ooh
I need you
I can't live without your love---Lyrics submitted by Vicky.
