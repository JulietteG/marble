Run
Run 'til you drop
Hide
Everyone knows

We all trade in never befores
Selling out for the score

Pray
Squeal when you're caught
Cry
It's not my fault

Time to trade in never befores
Selling out for the score

It seems you prophesized, all of this would end
Were you burned away, when the sun rose again

Hate
Long wearing thin
Negative
All you've been

Time to trade in never befores
Selling out for the score

It seems you prophesized, all of this would end
Were you burned away, when the sun rose again---Lyrics submitted by C.
