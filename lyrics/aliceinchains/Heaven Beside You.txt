Be what you wanna be
See what you came to see
Been what you wanna be
I don't like what I see

Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, Hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, Hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you, Hell within
And you think you have it still,
Heaven inside you

So there's problems in your life
That's fucked up
And I'm not blind
I'm just see-through, faded
Super jaded
And out of my mind

Do what you wanna do
Go out and seek your truth
When I'm down and blue
Rather be me than you

Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, Hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, Hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you, Hell within
And you wish you had it still,
Heaven inside you

So there's problems in your life
That's fucked up
But you're not blind
I'm just see-through, faded
Over-rated
And out of my mind

Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, Hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, Hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you, Hell within
And you know you have it still,
Heaven inside you

So there's problems in your life
That's fucked up
And you're not blind
You're just see-through, faded
Over-rated
And out of your mind---Lyrics submitted by Jack.
