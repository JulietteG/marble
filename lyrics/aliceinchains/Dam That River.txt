I broke you in the canyon
I drowned you in the lake
You, a snake that I would trample
Only thing I'd not embrace

Oh you couldn't dam that river?
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river?
And it washed me so far away

I pushed and then you stumbled
I kicked you in the face
You stared at me so hollow
Got to keep that killin' pace

CHORUS

I burned the place around you
I hit you with a rake
You piss up on my candle
So proving you're a fake

CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Thanatos.
