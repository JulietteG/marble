yeah ow,
I have never felt such
frustration,
or lack of self-control,
I want you to kill me,
and dig me under,
I want to live no more,
one who doesn't care,
is one who shouldn't be,
I try to hide myself from what is wrong for me,
for me,

I want to taste dirty,
the stinging pistol,
in my mouth on my tongue,
 I,want you to scrape me,
from the walls,
and go crazy
like you made me,
one who doesn't care ,is one who shouldn't be,
I tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me,
one who doesn't care,yeah,
is one who shouldn't be,
tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me,
for me....yeah...ow..

yeah...

you, you are so special,
you have the talent,
to make me feel like dirt,
you ,you use your talent,
to dig me under,
and cover me with dirt,
one who doesn't care ,
is one who shouldn't be,
I tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me,
one who doesn't care,yeah,
is one who shouldn't be,
I tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me,
yeah.............---Lyrics submitted by JOHN.
