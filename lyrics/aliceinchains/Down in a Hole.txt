Bury me softly in this womb 
I give this part of me for you 
Sand rains down and here I sit 
Holding rare flowers 
In a tomb...in bloom

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved 
See my heart I decorate it like a grave 
You don't understand who they 
Thought I was supposed to be 
Look at me now I'm a man 
Who won't let himself be 

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
Id like to fly, 
But my wings have been so denied 

Down in a hole and they've put all 
The stones in their place 
Ive eaten the sun so my tongue 
Has been burned of the taste 
I have been guilty 
Of kicking myself in the teeth 
I will speak no more 
Of my feelings beneath 

Down in a hole, feeling so small 
Down in a hole, losing my soul 
Id like to fly but my 
Wings have been so denied 

Bury me softly in this womb 
Oh I want to be inside of you 
I give this part of me for you 
Oh I want to be inside of you 
Sand rains down and here I sit 
Holding rare flowers (oh I want to be inside of you) 
In a tomb
Oh I want to be inside... 

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losing my soul
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, outta control
I'd like to fly but my 
Wings have been so denied---Lyrics submitted by Kevin B..
