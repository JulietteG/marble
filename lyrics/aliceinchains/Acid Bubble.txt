You tried to kill me off
Surprised I remain?
A scale tips impossible
Afraid of my own game

And I always paid attention to all the lines you crossed
Forgive this imperfection, it shows, and know
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner
Dies in a corner, unloved inside your mind

Intent obsolesence built into the system

I tried to shake it off
You can't remove the stain
A scale breaks impossible
Afraid we are the same

And you never paid attention to all the lines I crossed
Forgive this imperfection, it shows, and know
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner
Dies in a corner, unloved inside your mind

Intent obsolesence built into the system
Built into the system---Lyrics submitted by Thanatos.
