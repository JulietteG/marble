you insult me in my home
you're forgiven this time
things go well, your eyes dilate
you shake, and I'm high?
look in my eyes deep and watch
the clouds change with time
20 hours won't print
my picture milk carton size
carton size
carton size

call me up congratulations
ain't the real why
there's no pressure besides brilliance
let's say by day nine
endless corporate ignorance lets
me control time
by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way

once again you see an in 
discolored skin gives you away
so afraid you kindly gurgle out a date
for me

now the body of one soul I adore
wants to die
you have always told me you'd
not live past 25
I say stay long enough to repay
all who caused strife

once again you see an in 
discolored skin gives you away
so afraid you'd kindly gurgle out a date
for me---Lyrics submitted by jennifer.
