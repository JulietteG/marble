Began this take at 7:38
Head hit the board, enough that it aches
Wonder should I be workin' so late

Began this take at 7:38
Head hit the board, enough that it aches
Wonder should I be workin' so late
Wonder should I be workin' so late

Began this take at 7:38
Head hit the board, enough that it aches
Wonder should I be workin' so late
Wonder should I be workin' so late

Well, the nothin' song sticks to your mouth
Like peanut butter on the brain
Nothin' ever stays the same

Went outside to give all a break
Wearing cowhide steak on a skate
Back inside Sam, throw away your cake
Went outside to give all a break

Went outside to give all a break
Wearing cowhide steak on a skate
Back inside Sam, throw away your cake
Back inside Sam, throw away your cake

Well, the nothin' song sticks to your mouth
Like peanut butter on the brain
Nothin' ever stays the same

Well, the nothin' song sticks to your mouth
Like peanut butter on the brain
Nothin' ever stays the same

Nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin'

Gotta finish so I can awake
Feed the cat as she spreads all the waste
Snap her neck or trade in for new make

Gotta finish so I can awake
Feed the cat as she spreads all the waste
Snap her neck or trade in for new make
Snap her neck or trade in for new make

Well, the nothin' song sticks to your mouth
Like peanut butter on the brain
Nothin' ever stays the same
Well, the nothin' song sticks to your mouth

Nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin'---Lyrics submitted by daphne.
