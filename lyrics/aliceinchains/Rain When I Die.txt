Is she ready to know my frustration?
What she's slippin' inside, slow castration
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me
Did she come here to try, try to take me?

And did she call my name?
I think it's gonna rain
Oh, when I die

Was it somethin' I said held against me?
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing
I can help her but won't, now she hates me

CHORUS

She won't let me hide
She don't want me to cry

Yeah!

Will she keep on the ground, try to ground me?
Slowly forgive my lie, lie to save me
Could she love me again, or will she hate me?
Probably not, I know why, can't explain me?

CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by Thanatos.
