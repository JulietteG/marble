I'm, thinking its a sign,
That the Freckles in our eyes are mirror images,
and when we kiss their perfectly aligned.
And I, have to Speculate,
That god himself did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces from the clay
And true, It may seem like a stretch 
but its thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when your,away when I am missing you to death
When your out there on the road, 
for several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio, I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
come down now, they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come Down now, but we'll stay

I, tried my best to leave
a song on your machine, but that persistent beating sounded thin upon listening
and that frankly will not fly
you will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the wind
doze down when this is guiding your mind

They will see us waving from such great heights
come down now, they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now, but we'll stay---Lyrics submitted by natalia Urrutia.
