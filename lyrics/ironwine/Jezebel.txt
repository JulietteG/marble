who's seen jezebel?
she was born to be the woman i would know
and hold like the breeze 
half as tight as both our eyes closed

who's seen jezebel?
she went walking where the cedars line the road
her blouse on the ground 
where the dogs were hungry, roaming

saying, "wait, we swear 
we'll love you more and holy
jezebel, it's we, we that you are for 
only"

who's seen jezebel?
she was born to be the woman we could blame
make me a beast half as brave
i'd be the same

who's seen jezebel?
she was gone before i ever got to say
"lay here my love 
you're the only shape i'll pray to, jezebel"

who's seen jezebel?
will the mountain last as long as i can wait
wait like the dawn 
how it aches to meet the day

who's seen jezebel?
she was certainly the spark for all i've done
the window was wide
she could see the dogs come running

saying, "wait, we swear 
we'll love you more and holy
jezebel, it's we, we that you are for 
only"---Lyrics submitted by Jezsa.
