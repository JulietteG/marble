Will you say when I'm gone away
My lover came to me and we'd lay
In rooms unfamiliar but until now
Oh oh oh oh
Until now
Oh oh oh oh
Until now

Will you say to them when I'm gone
I loved your son for his sturdy arms
We both learned to cradle then live without
Oh oh oh oh
Live without
Oh oh oh oh
Live without

Will you say when I'm gone away
Your father's body was judgment day
We both dove and rose to the riverside
Oh oh oh oh
Riverside
Oh oh oh oh
Riverside

Will you say to me when I'm gone
Your face has faded but lingers on
Cause each light strikes a deal with each coming night
Oh oh oh oh
Coming night
Oh oh oh oh
Coming night
Oh oh oh oh
Coming night
Oh oh oh oh
Coming night---Lyrics submitted by Abby.
