And you can't do this and you don't do that[x3]

(David David Banner Banner)

Southside nigga that she wit aint shit
Southside nigga that she wit aint shit

And you can't do this and you don't do that
And you can't do this and you don't do that

Southside nigga that she wit aint shit
Southside nigga that she wit aint shit

And you can't do this and you don't do that
And you can't do this and you don't do that

Shawty say you dont beat it up no more
You dont come around here and throw dat ass on the floor
Don't spend her no time
Don't spend her no mind 
You dont take her out to eat
and you never treat her kind

Man... I ain't even touch her but another nigga
will come through and gonna fuck her
You need to get yo mind right
Mane go and raise your kids
Put a man in they life

Uhn, O I'm a put it in ya wife
Man I'm tryna tell you what the broad said last night

He don't stick it he don't lick it lick it
He don't take me out to the movies or buy me liquor

Southside nigga that she wit aint shit
Southside nigga that she wit aint shit

And you can't do this and you don't do that
And you can't do this and you don't do that

Southside nigga that she wit aint shit
Southside nigga that she wit aint shit

And you can't do this and you don't do that
And you can't do this and you don't do that

I walked in the spot
Gurl asked for my name
I looked back at her and I said T-Pain
I bought her a drank
She said she was a stripper
I'm making movie money like well so I tipped her

Now she grabbin' on my zipper
You know what happening next 
She say you don't listen to her life it was stress
Word to the wise go on keep it trill
Tell your old lady she gone get it how she lives

Southside nigga that she wit aint shit
Southside nigga that she wit aint shit

And you can't do this and you don't do that
And you can't do this and you don't do that

Southside nigga that she wit aint shit
Southside nigga that she wit aint shit

And you can't do this and you don't do that
And you can't do this and you don't do that

Now this is for my ladies lookin good in the club
That nigga ain't shit girl gone throw it up

And you can't do this and you don't do that

It's some niggas like me waiting for you in the back
Now this is for my ladies who lookin good in the club
That nigga ain't shit girl gone throw it up

And you can't do this and you don't do that

It's some niggas like me waiting for you in the back

Southside nigga that she wit aint shit
Southside nigga that she wit aint shit

And you can't do this and you don't do that
And you can't do this and you don't do that

Southside nigga that she wit aint shit
Southside nigga that she wit aint shit

And you can't do this and you don't do that
And you can't do this and you don't do that

[repeat both chorus above]

And you can't do this and you don't do that
