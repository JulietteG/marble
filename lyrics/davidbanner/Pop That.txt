Pop that thang, girl
 Pop that, pop that, pop that thang, girl

[Verse 1:]
 Pop that thang, gone shake it for daddy
 You looking good when you up in the Caddywe comin' down, uh (Down)
 Then we up in the club, high as hell, we ain't givin' a fuck, Mistress screamin' now (Oh)
 Name the pot for me
 Later on you can gone ride on top of me
 Now we can blow another sack (Sack) forget about the 'Lac ('Lac)
 Keep the block and breaddaddy a stack
 It's like that!

[Chorus:]
 Hey, baby girl
 What's your name? Who you with?
 Do you wanna get down with this pimpin lil chick?
 Pop that thang, girl
 Pop that, pop that, pop that thang, girl
 Hey, baby girl
 What's your name? Who you with?
 Do you wanna get down with this pimpin lil chick?
 Pop that thang, girl
 Pop that, pop that, pop that thang, girl

[Verse 2:]
 I ain't lying, I get weak for the freak
 She's so sweet the way she pop, pop, pop, her butt-cheek
 She got golds in her mouth, always hollerin' about the South
 If the boys came through, now she's putting up the house (Oh yeah!)
 It's true, boo, what I'm doing to you
 They way you come through the crib when the night is through
 And go down (Down) bitches say this' what they loving us now
 They really wanna be you, but they don't know how girl

[Chorus:]
 Hey, baby girl
 What's your name? Who you with?
 Do you wanna get down with this pimpin lil chick?
 Pop that thang, girl
 Pop that, pop that, pop that thang, girl
 Hey, baby girl
 What's your name? Who you with?
 Do you wanna get down with this pimpin lil chick?
 Pop that thang, girl
 Pop that, pop that, pop that thang, girl

[Verse 3:]
 She looks so good when she came to me
 Said, "Boy, you better pay. I don't pop for free!"
 Put it like this, you can suck my peter
 Or even go home cause I really don't need her!
 I like girls that'll pop it all night for me (Night for me)
 And, if another bitch trip, she'll fight for me (Fight for me)
 And, she'll ride on top like a rodeo (A rodeo)
 She be poppin' in the club 'til it's time to go (Time to go, time to go, time to go)

[Verse 4:]
 Uh, then it's straight to the 'Lac,
 Screaming, "Bitch better gimme my stacks, believe that!"
 If the boy started trippin, it's click-clack!
 Pimp grabbing my hand like they the Mack
 (From the mighty, mighty, Mississipp, don't trip! Just call me, and apply for a pimp)
 It's all love
 Coming back for you boy back of the club
 When it's over, then maybe you get a hug

[Chorus:]
 Hey, baby girl
 What's your name? Who you with?
 Do you wanna get down with this pimpin lil chick?
 Pop that thang, girl
 Pop that, pop that, pop that thang, girl
 Hey, baby girl
 What's your name? Who you with?
 Do you wanna get down with this pimpin lil chick?
 Pop that thang, girl
 Pop that, pop that, pop that thang, girl

Pop that thang, girl
 Pop that, pop that, pop that thang, girl

Pop that thang girl (Pop that thang for me)
 Pop that thang girl
 Pop that thang (Pop that thang for me)
 Pop that thang
 Yeah, yeah, Ohhhhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhh! Pop that, pop that, pop that thang!
