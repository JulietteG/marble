I wake up from an empty place
But I still cannot escape
It's like I'm lost in space 
Don't know which way to go
It hurts from head to toe

All I want is to last the day
Tears are raining on my face
I can't see my way
But I keep marching on until the tears are gone

I will press my feed against the sand
I will hold the sky up with my hands
I will make a world where days are brighter
And keep it under my heart, keep it under my heart

Hold on tight, I won't let you down 
I will go another round with the music loud
Blow the shadows away, cause I'm not afraid

I will press my feed against the sand
I will hold the sky up with my hands
I will make a world where days are brighter
And keep it under my heart, keep it under my heart

When the waves throw us back to shore 
We just swim some more
Carry on until we reach the other side 
Leave our troubles lying in the sun
Life has just begun, life has just begun

I will press my feed against the sand
I will hold the sky up with my hands
I will make a world where days are brighter
And keep it under my heart, keep it under my heart---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
