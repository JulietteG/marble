The sun sets - the night shines 
No more sweet sharade 
The sky falls - in your eyes 
Theres no haste to play 

I'm here to let you know 
You gotta go go go 

So don't move 
'cause your time has come 

Now the masquerade is over 
Gonna watch you come undone 

I got a heart shaped gun 
A heart shaped gun 
it's too late for bows and arrows 
You can't hide and you can't run 
I've got a heart shaped gun 
My deadly war - here I come 

You do fast - shot me down 
I fell at your feet 
Just one bullet 
I set fire 
To you make believe 

I'm here to let you know 
You gotta go go go 

Don't you move 
'cause your time has come 

Now the masquerade is over 
Gonna watch you come undone 

I got a heart shaped gun 
A heart shaped gun 
It's too late for bows and arrows 
You can't hide and you can't run 
I've got a heart shaped gun 
My deadly war - here I come 
Here I come 

Now the masquerade is over 
Gonna watch you come undone 
I got a heart shaped gun 
A heart shaped gun 

It's too late for bows and arrows 
You can't hide and you can't run 
I've got a heart shaped gun 
My deadly war - here I come---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
