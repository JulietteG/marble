I love to kiss you in summer rain
I love the smell of your bed
Theres something bout you I cant explain
Youre on a loop in my head

I love the sound of your voice at night
I love the taste of your lips
And when you look through me with your eyes
I can no longer resist

You leave me defenceless
As Im walking back home
You fill all my senses
So Im never alone
Im left feeling fragile
As you take me apart
Invasion of the heart

I love the way you keeping touching me
Feels like you enter my skin
Sometimes I think youre the enemy
Then I surrender within

You leave me defenceless
As Im walking back home
You fill all my senses
So Im never alone
Im left feeling fragile
As you take me apart
Invasion of the heart

Like a giant wave
Or a hurricane
You shoot me down with love
Again, again, again
Like a prisoner
Tries to break the chain
I free myself with love
Again, again, again

You leave me defenceless
As Im walking back home
You fill all my senses
So Im never alone
Im left feeling fragile
As you take me apart
Invasion of the heart---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
