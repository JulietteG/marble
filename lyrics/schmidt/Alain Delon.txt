Stranger you seem, lost on the street
What is your story, where will it lead?
Walk by my side, spend a little time
Love me like Alain Delon

Into your room, I spray some perfume
What is your pleasure, I dont assume
Shot in the dark, straight to my heart
Love me like Alain Delon

Last cigarette, nothing is said
Will you remember this when its dead?
I need the thrill, were in for the kill
Love me like Alain Delon

Ill be your dream girl
And Ill be the sunrise
If you dont kill me
I will survive

Stranger you seem, lost on the street
What is your story, where will it lead?
Walk by my side, spend a little time
Love me like Alain Delon---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
