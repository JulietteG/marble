Hes always around me
But not really here
If I try to catch him
He just disappears
He comes and goes
Like the day and the night
Just like a shadow
Here by my side

Hes the shadowman
The shadowman
Calling around at 3am
Seems he wants me back again
Says we are a perfect fit
Then puts me out 
Like a cigarette
His lips are wet

Im dreaming about
How hed once hold me tight
Didnt let go 
Till the end of the night
He talked so dirty
The walls would turn pink
I lied to his face
Called him Mr Big

Hes the shadowman
The shadowman
Calling around at 3am
Seems he wants me back again
Says we are the perfect fit
Then puts me out 
Like a cigarette
His lips are wet

Hes the shadowman
The shadowman
Calling around at 3am
Seems he wants me back again
Says we are the perfect fit
Then puts me out 
Like a cigarette
His lips are wet---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
