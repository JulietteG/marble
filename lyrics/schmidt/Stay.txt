Stay for a minute
Stay for an hour
Stay for the rest of my life
Cause I cant see a world without you
Its just not right

Stay till the morning
Stay through the weekend
Stay till the end of the year
Cause I dont want a moment without you here

If you should go
What would I do?
Id be a lyric without a tune

Stay for a minute
Stay for an hour
Stay for the rest of my life
Cause I cant see a world without you
Its just not right

I cant exist 
Without you near
Dont try to hide, Ill make it clear

Stay through the good times
Stay through the bad times
Stay when were down to the wire
When a love is built on forever
It will never expire

In a world that is full of deception
In a city, drunk with desire
Its so hard to find your own peace of mind
There must be something that is real---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
