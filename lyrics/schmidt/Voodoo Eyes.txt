Take, take another look and see
See what wicked hearts can make
Make a little room for me

Pray, praying you'll be on your knees
I need you like I need the pain
The pain is gonna set you free

Why'd you make me wait 
Avoid my gaze
Look into my voodoo eyes
Don't turn away come out and play
Look into my voodoo eyes

Stop, stop before I go too far
Far enough to make you break
Stop me from this sweet mistake

Why'd you make me wait 
Avoid my gaze
Look into my voodoo eyes
Don't turn away come out and play
Look into my voodoo eyes

Take, take another look and see
See what wicked hearts can make
Make a little room for me

Why'd you make me wait 
Avoid my gaze
Look into my voodoo eyes
Don't turn away come out and play
Look into my voodoo eyes---Lyrics submitted by Tyler Polzin.
