[Fergie]
Na Na NaNa Na Na NaNa
Na Na NaNa Na Na NaNa

Sound selector activate your transistor
transmitter audio wears through your system
sub-sonic mega bolt base from the kickin'

Na Na NaNa Na Na NaNa

ghetto blaster blatin' on your block
pumpin out megahurtz (mega-megawatts)
you can get electric shock from my flow
bitches on my dick (Oh No) They on my dildo
Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do
i get the money money, i get dough
EQ the equalizer for the stereo

Na Na NaNa Na Na NaNa

We the blast masters, the radiation
International coming to your nation
feel the feel the feel the feel the vibration
we killin killin killin radio station

[Chorus]
Kill em with the sound kill, em kill em with the sound
hit em with the frequency
shoot em with the bass shoot, shoot em with the bass
super mega frequency
kick em with the drum, kick em kick em with the drum
get em with the melody
beat em with the beat, beat em beat em with the beat
super mega frequency

In the Electric City, Electric City
Electric City, Electric City
Electric City

Kill em

[Taboo]
Step up in the par, step up in the party
sippin' on coke and baca bacardi
beat so dope...
lord have mercy lord have lord have mercy
la dee dee dee deedeedeedee la dee da
killer on the lose like i'm Jeffree...
ready to produce mega rhythm yes sir
call me mad scientist, the proffessor

[Will.I.Am]
i program the rhythm
ask em who killed em they say Will.i.am did em
boom boom pow let me style when i hit em
i know how to kill em when i kill em

[Chorus]
Kill em with the sound, kill em kill em with the sound
hit em with the frequency
shoot em with the bass shoot, shoot em with the bass
super mega frequency
kick em with the drum, kick em kick em with the drum
get em with the melody
beat em with the beat, beat em beat em with the beat
super mega frequency

In the Electric City, Electric City
Electric City, Electric City
Electric City

Kill em

[Apl.De.Ap]
Electric shock surgin' down your city
higher... B.E.P comity
transmitting sound got the girly's silly
bouncin' around tryin' to show me tittys
watch out now we about to blow
big...
energy got the whole system overload
got the ... got the eardrums about to explode
extra, extra... powerful
blow your mind its the incredible
Apl.De.Ap the original
im the thriller of Manila in the Filipino

[Chorus]
Kill em with the sound, kill em kill em with the sound
hit em with the frequency
shoot em with the bass shoot, shoot em with the bass
super mega frequency
kick em with the drum, kick em kick em with the drum
get em with the melody
beat em with the beat, beat em beat em with the beat
super mega frequency

In the Electric City, Electric City
Electric City, Electric City
Electric City
