Smile, baby. What happened to that smile, baby?
Ooh lay down baby- it's your turn, And I'll hold you tonight.
Sleep inside my arms baby. Can you feel my heart baby?
Listen to that sound, baby-- it's your song,
And I'm singing for you tonight.

CHORUS:
Baby blue eyes sleep all night.
Angel from heaven, you keep me alive.
I'll rescue your heart, and you rescue mine.
With no regrets let love take flight.
Baby blue eyes I'm by your side.
Nothing can harm you or scare you tonight.
I've never felt so in love in my life
Never so deep inside, my baby blue eyes.

Oh, my lover, baby, what you worrying your head for, baby?
Cause I'd walk through the fire baby, and I will, Save you tonight. 
Don't put up a fight, please baby.
Won't you let your heart keep melting, baby?
Cause I'd cross the widest desert, baby
Well, I would--Just to see you smile.

CHORUS:
Baby blue eyes sleep all night.
Angel from heaven, you keep me alive.
I'll rescue your heart, and you rescue mine.
With no regrets let love take flight.
Baby blue eyes I'm by your side.
Nothing can harm you or scare you tonight.
I've never felt so in love in my life
Never so deep inside.

CHORUS:
Baby blue eyes sleep all night.
Angel from heaven, you keep me alive.
I'll rescue your heart, and you rescue mine.
With no regrets let love take flight.
Baby blue eyes I'm by your side.
Nothing can harm you or scare you tonight.
I've never felt so in love in my life
Never so deep inside
Never so deep inside
Never so deep inside
My baby blue eyes

[You breathe out, I'll breathe in.
Baby, be my oxygen.

Baby, give me your hand.]---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
