This time it's for real, I know what i feel.
You're just so adorable, so non-ignorable to me.
I'll wait for the day you'll sweep me away.
We'll lay in the grass forgetting the past.

CHORUS:
I love your beautiful face, your beautiful heart.
Those lovely eyes like midnight skies for me.
Holding my hand, that's where we began.
You are the perfect everything for me.

And, I've never seen how good it could be.
And my heart is blazing, cause you're so amazing to me.
It's been awhile since I've seen such a smile.
And you'e so mysterious, I'm so delirious.

CHORUS:
I love your beautiful face, your beautiful heart.
Those lovely eyes like midnight skies for me.
Holding my hand, that's where we began.
You are the perfect everything for me.

Yeah...
Na na na na na na na na na Yeah...
Na na na na na na na na na Yeah...

CHORUS:
Your beautiful face, your beautiful heart.
Those lovely eyes like midnight skies for me.
Holding my hand, that's where we began.
You are the perfect everything for me. (2xs)
You are the perfect perfect everything (3xs)
Everything for me.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
