He was a sad man, too young to be a mad man.
A little bit hungry, a little bit lonely. Off to save the world.
Death rests on the shoulders of this homeless soldier.
And there's a haunting spirit. He always hears it.
So he'll never close his eyes.

CHORUS:
Freedom's out there somewhere. You will find it.
Oh, Marine. With your heartstrings you have freed this nation.
Oh, Marine. With your bravery you've conquered war.
Oh, Marine. With pictures flashing those photographs
Keep coming back and memories play.
'Cause you will find your freedom day.

As he grew older, he watched the world grow colder.
So all that he fought for and always longed for.
Dwindled in the cold.
And as he lay dying, he heard his country crying.
And that haunting spirit was right there with him.
Then he closed his.

CHORUS:
Freedom's out there somewhere. You have found it.
Oh, Marine. With your heartstrings you have freed this nation.
Oh, Marine. With your bravery you've conquered war.
Oh, Marine. With pictures flashing those photographs
Keep coming back and memories play.
But you have found your freedom day.

Every day a similar story ends. 
Every day the same old story ends!

CHORUS:
Oh, Marine. With your heartstrings you have freed this nation.
Oh, Marine. With your bravery you've conquered war.
Oh, Marine. With pictures flashing those photographs
Keep coming back and memories play.
'Cause you have found your freedom day.
You have found your freedom day.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
