I may be living in a fantasy.
Believing there is something between you and me, baby.
But judging by the way you look at me, 
I'd be a fool to deny chemistry.
I see you trying to fight it, but you cannot hide it.
Just let it be. 

CHORUS:
Let it all out. Soak it all in.
Indulge in the leisures of love;
Cause it is ready to begin.
Ready or not, I'm gonna blast
Right through the excuses you've made.
And I'm headed straight for your heart.

This may not be just what you had in mind,
But when you stop searching oh,it's what you find.
Yeah, yeah.
I promise that I won't demand much time,
Cause all I want is just to say you're mine.
This may not be perfect timing,
But there's no confining.
Just breathe.

CHORUS:
Let it all out. Soak it all in.
Indulge in the leisures of love;
Cause it is ready to begin.
Ready or not, I'm gonna blast
Right through the excuses you've made.
And I'm headed straight for your heart.

You've got meetings and appointments
And no time for real enjoyment.
Always planning for what happens next.
And oh if time is of the essence, 
I've been standing in your presence,
I can't wait around forever for this.
One day you'll wake up and you'll realize what you've left behind.
And then you'll see you're standing in the wake of your mess,
But you'll have yourself.

CHORUS:
Let it all out. Soak it all in.
Indulge in the leisures of love;
Cause it is ready to begin.
Ready or not, I'm gonna blast
Right through the excuses you've made.
And I'm headed straight for your heart. (2xs)

Go right through the excuses you've made
And I'm headed straight for your heart.
I'm headed straight for your heart.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
