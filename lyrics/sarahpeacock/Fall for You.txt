Strange things are happening.
My icy heart is melting.
For you to make a home inside of it, yeah.
There's nothing I could do.
You made me love you.
So you're the one to blame for all of this, yeah.

CHORUS:
If it's gonna be that easy,
I hope you can catch me.
When I fall for you.
You know how to drive me crazy.
Well I haven't felt that lately, no.
Yeah, mmm.

I lay awake in my bed thinking of what you said.
How you'd love to watch me.
Dream of you at night, yeah.
Well, I have felt like this before.
My heart was kicked out the back door.
But caution seems so silly now with you, yeah.

CHORUS:
If it's gonna be that easy,
I hope you can catch me.
When I fall for you.
You know how to drive me crazy.
Well, I haven't felt that lately, no.
Yeah.

It's been awhile since I've lingered with anyone.
But I love to watch you smile,
Oh it makes me happy, yeah.

CHORUS:
If it's gonna be that easy,
I hope you can catch me.
When I fall for you.
You know how to drive me crazy.
And I haven't felt that lately, no.
Yeah, mmm.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
