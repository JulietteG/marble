I want to know what the silence in the moonlight means.
I want to know the meaning of the song you sing.
And I want to know if we're thinking the same thing.
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

I want to know how my smile makes you feel.
I want to know if you've noticed something deeper here.
And I want to know if it's love that you fear.
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

Well, I know that this could all be nothing.
Your heart may be sold on someone else, someone else.
But I wish that I could crawl inside you.
Just to find a way that I could tell.
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

I want to know what your heart is telling you.
I want to know if clarity is peeking through.
Well, I want to know what my brown eyes say to you.
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
