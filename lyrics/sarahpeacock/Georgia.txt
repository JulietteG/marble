You cannot keep a heart where it doesn't belong,
You cannot build the Eiffel Tower where the soil isn't strong.
And if I fight the feelings deep inside my heart for very long.
It'll only be that much longer till this journey brings me home.
There is something deep inside of me; 
A space one thing will complete.

CHORUS:
Give me my Georgia. My heart is in your clay.
I've been gone for quite awhile, but I'm comin' back to stay.
Give me my Georgia. Your sun upon my cheek.
Time passed the test, it's laid to rest.
And I'm never gonna leave. Well. I'm never gonna leave.
Yeah.

I've been looking for answers only time could tell.
I've been doing all my dreaming from the bottom of a well.
Then I heard a whisper deep within the corner of my soul.
And I did not have to hide where I knew my heart must go.
There's a longing buried in her tone.
It's in the way she calls me home.

CHORUS:
Give me my Georgia. My heart is in your clay.
Well, I've been gone for quite awhile, but I'm comin' back to stay.
Give me my Georgia. Your sun upon my cheek.
Time passed the test, it's laid to rest.
And I'm never gonna leave. I'm never gonna leave.

Sometimes it hurts so bad.
And I just can't stand to be so far away.
I need your touch, I need your love.
But there will come a day.
When missing you is only just a memory I can say,
"Oh, I've got Jesus and Georgia, and it's all gonna be okay."

CHORUS:
Give me my Georgia. My heart is in your clay.
I've been gone for quite awhile, but I'm comin' back to stay.
Give me my Georgia. Your sun upon my cheek.
Time passed the test, it's laid to rest.
And I'm never gonna leave. I'm never gonna leave.(2xs)
