1 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
2 When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away

3 Some bright morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away
4 To a land* on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away

5 When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away
6 Like a bird from these prison walls, I'll fly, I'll fly away

7 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
8 When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away

9 Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I'll fly away
10 No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I'll fly away

11 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
12 When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away

13 Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away
14 To a land where joy will never end, I'll fly away

15 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
16 When I die, hallellujah by and by, I'll fly away

17 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
18 When I die, hallellujah by and by, I'll fly away

19 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
20 When I die, hallellujah by and by, I'll fly away

21 I'll fly away

22 Oh yeah, I'll fly away---Lyrics submitted by Red HoTT JuGGaLeTTe.
