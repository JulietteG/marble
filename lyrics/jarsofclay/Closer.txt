Well you thought you let go, but you're still hanging on
Mother earth's slowing down, she's still spinning around
And we are getting dizzy

I'll drop out of the race for more personal space
Cuz the rockets we're in, gets so cold and I miss your skin
It's just how I'm feelin.

If you need more love, well you've got to get close to me
If you want my love, well you've got to get closer to me

No unreachable itch, if you hemorrhage I'll stitch
You are tears, I'm a cheek, 
I'm a pail on your boat with slow leaks
out to sea for weeks

If you want my love, well you've got to get close to me
If you need my love, well you've got to get closer to me
Oh, if you want my love

I don't understand why we can't get close enough
I want your kite strings tangled in my trees all wrapped up
I don't understand why we can't get close enough
I'll be the comets that are fallin from the sky you light up

You're my shirt, I'm an arm
I'm the tick, you're the bomb
You're the L and the V, I'm the O and the E, and we
Am I speaking clearly?

If you want my love, well you've got to get close to me
Ooh, if you want my love

I don't understand why we can't get close enough
I want your kite strings tangled in my trees all wrapped up
I don't understand why we can't get close enough
I'll be the comets that are fallin from the sky you light up

Because I don't understand why we can't get close enough
I'll miss the shivers in my spine every time that we touch.---Lyrics submitted by vic.
