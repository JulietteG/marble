When the light sets the tune to emotion, it's hard
When my tongue trips me up in delusion, makes it harder still
Let's you and me dance now until we drop
And watch the sea lap on the shore

You're the one thing I need - guess you know it, 
Well, we've got our chance if you'd just let me show it.

I picture my world, you and me - 
I picture the whole damn thing, yeah
Are you too stubborn or blind not to know that
I picture my world, you and me
A place where our love can live forever

Not live a lie, never say die
Live the life, never say die

There's a place, I can go to - 
to clear the air as if you could ever believe me
I put shape in to my life
So many times I've fought these feelings of frustration
I've pushed our luck a little hard.

You're the one thing I need - guess you know it, 
Well, we've got our chance if you'd just let me show it.

I picture my world, you and me - 
I picture the whole damn thing, yeah
Are you too stubborn or blind not to know that
I picture my world, you and me
A place where our love can live forever, yeah

Not live a lie, never say die
Live the life, never say die

Do you understand?---Lyrics submitted by Nick.
