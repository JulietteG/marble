You set me free, under my father's dream
Gently left it all my shadows

Here where i stand with only a hand full of you
Weighing less than a sparrow,
Yet more than my life

First of my days you sent me of on to this journey
To become, the pilgrim on the path of love

You will be the mountains i will climb
You will be the rivers i will cross
I will be the voice to tell your tale

You will be the beggar i will feed
You will be the dragon i will calm
I will be the voice to tell your tale

And i shall not be sad.

In the garden of hope 
Far from sums of pride and victory
You kept a place 
For the simple melodies

Broken the wings, shattered the dreams 
And still you're walking strong
You've always been
The pilgrim on the path of love

You will be the blizzard i will cross
You will be the storm that i will ride
I will be the voice to tell your tale

You will be the rivers i will cross
You will be the mountains i will climb
I will be the voice to tell your tale

You will be the words that i will find
You will be the strength that still be kind

And i shall not be sad---Lyrics submitted by Eyal Sade.
