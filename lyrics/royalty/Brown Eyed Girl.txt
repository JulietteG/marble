Heyyyyy....
Aoooooo...

My Brown Eyed Girl...[2x]
Could you be my

[CHORUS]
Brown Eyed Girl
Baby ur a stunna'
Saw u from my humma'
You can have my numba'

Brown eyed girl...
Hotter than the summa'
Round you I get dumber
I can be ur wonda'
Brown eyed girl...

[Royalty]
Now..She's my baby beauty,
Such a cutie,
eyes look like a bag from Louie,
picture perfect she's a tan,
she's my lover she's my friend.

She's the other half no other girl can never match,
she's the lighter, I'm the flame,
she's the heartbreak, I'm the pain.

We just go together so forever,
nobody can know me better,
nobody can luv you better.

"L" has never been my letter,
till today, now I say,
I luv you, you luv me too.

She's my baby, I'm her boo.
Come here brown eyes,
I luv you...

[CHORUS 2x]
Brown Eyed Girl
Baby ur a stunna'
Saw u from my humma'
You can have my numba'

Brown eyed girl...
Hotter than the summa'
Round you I get dumber
I can be ur wonda'
Brown eyed girl...

I got it from her for me,
could u be my shawty, I could be ur god,
because that's my baby, she got me hypnotized.

The was she moves her body side to side,
never seems like its so fly
She the type I want to try
(Can I make you my)
Brown eyed baby, so crazy
u got me falling in luv.
I know u dangerous,
but I just can't get enough

The way you put it down (down)
Got me givin' you the crown (crown)
Ladies when I come to town (townnnn)
Holler if ur eyes are brown

[CHORUS 2x]
Brown Eyed Girl
Baby ur a stunna'
Saw u from my humma'
You can have my numba'

Brown eyed girl...
Hotter than the summa'
Round you I get dumber
I can be ur wonda'
Brown eyed girl...

[Royalty]
Te amo me amor,
never felt like this before,
she's the one that I adore,
she's the one for me I'm sure

(Te amo me amor,
never felt like this before,
she's the one that I adore,
she's the one for me I'm sure...)

[CHORUS]
Brown Eyed Girl
Baby ur a stunna' (baby ur a stunna...)
