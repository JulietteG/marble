Here in Milwaukee
We have a tradition
of great epicurian delight

We cook up that little fish
Till it's nice and brown and light

The little fishies taste so good
that we do it in every nook and cranny
of our fair city on Friday night

Regardless of the weather
or whether the beer's dark or light
Every Friday in Milwaukee is a 
Fish Fry Friday Night

Grandma and Grandpa are getting dressed up
Beause they're going out tonight
a run right down to the corner bar
to have a fish fry
Grandpa worked hard all of his life
and he wants to have fun tonight
Grandma's sick of cooking but she's feeling alright
because she knows it's Friday night

We've got all the fish you can eat
and lots of coleslaw too
Bread and butter with a pinch of salt
and lots of beer for you

(Don't forget the french fries and potato pancakes with the apple sauce)

I heard it all started 
sometime 
after w w 2
in a place called the Tanner Paul Restaurant
it's some kind of VFW
way out there in West Allis there
Thank you Louie Hersinger
for starting the fishy tradition
Its a real fine deal
Its a blue collar meal
so get a bar and start fishin'


It's the Friday Night Fish Fry
It's the Friday Night Fish Fry

It's the Friday Night Fish Fry
It's the Friday Night Fish Fry

It's the Friday Night Fish Fry
It's the Friday Night Fish Fry

It's the Friday Night Fish Fry
It's the Friday Night Fish Fry

Pass the tartar sauce please
And waitress, bring us another pitcher of beer
You know you have to have the perfect balance
The Beer
The coleslaw
The French Fries

Aahhh FISH---Lyrics submitted by Mike.
