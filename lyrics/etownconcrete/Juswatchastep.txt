Back in the day, when we had nothing, 
and shit was fucked up without a buck, 
but who cared, gave a shit
childhood lost and I grew up quick
Hope for the best but expect the worst
get mine survive the truth hurts
Things don't happen the way we want to 
can't understand why true friends are so few
Shit's at a standstill and just doesn't fit right
I'm getting tired of everything. of. 
try to impress you fake  guess it shows
fucked up and now your slipping
looking back you'll be alone and then you'll wish
you did things different
keep your head up son and watch your step
tables turn people learn 
no remorse no regrets
tables turn people learn---Lyrics submitted by Rita Atwist.
