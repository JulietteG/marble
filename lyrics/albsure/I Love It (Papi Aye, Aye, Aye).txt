(Verse 1)
I like when you receive me
You keep me save and warm
When your body starts to tremble its like a quiet storm
Girl i love it when you wait for me
And hold on til its time
Girl then we reach the peak and the explosion hits
Girl you blow my mind

(Chorus)
I love it when you talk to me and say (aye aye aye)
I love it when you close to me it (feels so right)
I love it when you creep with me (creep that way)
And i love it when we moan too (Ooh feels right)

(Verse 2)
All you want from me is just to love you right
And never do you wrong
I love playing in your box when its late at night
To our favorite song (when i get this feeling)
I watch your body in the shower
Step into the beauty light
Before you dry off, step into the room
Damn girl your body's so right
Girl I'm looking forward to tonight
Cause papi chuloo's gonna make you feel so right
Mami i don't think tonight i hesitate
Lady you should feel free tonight
Just scream my name
Ohhhh

(Chorus out)---Lyrics submitted by Tosha.
