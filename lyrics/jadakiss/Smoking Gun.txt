Jasmine Sullivan:
You're the only one I love, 
Jadakiss: uh huh
The only man I know that I can trust, 
Jadakiss: yup
And if I ever should need u, 
I know you'd come, 
Jadakiss: yea
Ready to kill with a smoking gun, 
Echo: (with a smoking gun)

Verse 1
Jadakiss:
Yo Shawty is courageous, 
Going through the stages, 
Of where her body is more mature, 
Than her age is, 
Far from the daddy's little girl type, 
Can't even imagine what her world's like, 
It all started off as a youngin, 
Stepfather used to touch her, 
And she couldn't say nothing, 
The more she held in the pain, 
It kept coming, 
Eventually it scarred her for life as a woman, 
And then he just kept touching her, 
Inside that was crushing her, 
I got something to discuss with her, 
I'm coming with the tech, 
With the ear holes and the mufflers.

Verse 2
Jadakiss:
Yo now she really stressed bad, 
Baby by her step dad, 
Her and lil man, 
All alone up in Westhave, 
Tough road, 
And without a car, 
It's a tough walk, 
Worse part about it, 
Is her mom think it's her fault, 
Word get around yall, 
Know how the town talk, 
Baby girl is innocent, 
Labeled ah the town whore, 
Suicidial thoughts on her mind, 
Even now more, 
First the abuse, 
Now she gotta raise her child poor, 
And that's why I feel for you, 
That's why I'm ready to kill for you, 
That's a black girl lost for ya, 
Call me, 
I'm come through and let it off for ya.

Verse 3
Jadakiss:
It aint your fault boo, 
I'm always here for you to talk to, 
Hold your head high when you walk through, 
Sometimes the devil's temptation would force you, 
One thing about the Lord, 
He'd never cross you, 
Look at all the bad things that they tried to do to you, 
And you're still queen of this earth and you're beautiful, 
Everything happens for a reason, 
If you ever need me, 
Call me, 
I'm coming through squeezing.
