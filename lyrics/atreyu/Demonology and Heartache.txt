So unaffectionate
So insecure
You claim to know, a thing or two about heartache
And what its like, to have your insides pulled out

And I believe you!

I see it every time, your pallbearers pallor is
Obscured by the darkness (The darkness)
Dancing across your face (Across your face)
And when the blackness veils, your eyes, in pain.
I know what its like when memories make you wince
And love letter read like obituaries
And photo albums, are the books of the dead
I need no reminders (No more reminders)
I'll forget the past and lay it to rest!

If I had my way Id cut
The calluses off your
off your breaking heart
If I could get past the sternum
Cauterize those wounds with every kiss I could give to you
Im holding your heart in my hands
The reason it still beats!

Am I being too cryptic?
Am I being too obscure?
Am I being too cryptic?
Am I being too obscure?

Love kills! Romance is dead!
And I dont even trust myself, but I love you!
And you can pull my wings apart
And pin me down under glass until the end of days!
If it can help you discover that we share the same pain!
I just hope you write your thesis before
Your subject is dead
No life after death!

If I had my way Id cut
The calluses off your
Off your breaking heart
If I could get past the sternum
Cauterize those wounds with every kiss I could give to you
Im holding your heart in my hands
The reason it still beats!

If I had my way Id cut
The calluses off your
Off your breaking heart
If I could get past the sternum
Cauterize those wounds with every kiss I could give to you
Im holding your heart in my hands
The reason it still beats!---Lyrics submitted by nicholas.
