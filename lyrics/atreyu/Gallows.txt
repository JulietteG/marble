This life starts with a heartbeat
Is it beat, beat, beat, beat, beating me down?

Like the loser I am?
I can't help, but to see
That success scares, the living shit outta me
Like the loser I am

Everytime I walk away, 
Every word I've ever said

Restless, chasing shadows
Choices, facing gallows pole

Are you hanging by a thread?
Or swinging from the ropes?

Don't think we don't see your scars
Are you afraid of who you are?

Are you afraid of who you are?

Denial, a subtle burn
Is it burn, burn, burn, burn, burning me out?
Or feeding the flames?

Spread out the ash 
Pretend to see,
That you can still find some value in me
Or just feed the flames?

Everytime I walk away, 
Every word I've ever said

Restless, chasing shadows
Choices, facing gallows pole

Are you hanging by a thread?
Or swinging from the ropes?

Don't think we don't see your scars
Are you afraid of who you are?

Oh my God what am I afraid of?
Success or not having what it takes

Oh my God are you afraid of me?
And everything that brings

Restless, chasing shadows
Choices, facing gallows pole

Are you hanging by a thread?
Or swinging from the ropes?

Don't think we don't see your scars
Are you afraid of who you are?

Afraid of who you are?

Are you afraid of who you are?---Lyrics submitted by DeathBecameMe.
