There is no light in sight 
Only a tunnel of pain 
Only your legs will carry you 
Carry you to the end 

Live your full for yourself 
Or live for the struggle at best 
Just don't let it strangle you 
Just don't let it strangle you 

And after all this 
No one will carry you home 
And without a thought 
You let your guard fall to the ground 
Thought you were the king 
But now it's gone 
Taste the air as you pull it in your lungs 
Try to savour it for one more song 

The thief of the battle 
A metaphor for this life 
You never see it hit you 
Until it smashes you in the face 

You try as best you can 
And life knocks you down again 
Just don't let it strangle you 
Just don't let it strangle you 

And after all this 
No one will carry you home 
And without a thought 
You let your guard fall to the ground 
Thought you were the king 
But now it's gone 
Taste the air as you pull it in your lungs 
Try to savour it for one more song 

Get up 
Get up now 
Get up right now 
I scream to myself 

Get up 
Get up now 
Get up right now 
I scream to myself 

And after all this 
No one will carry you home 
And without a thought 
You let your guard fall to the ground 
Thought you were the king 
But now it's gone 
Taste the air as you pull it in your lungs 
Try to savour it for one more song 
Try to savour it for one more song---Lyrics submitted by Amy.
