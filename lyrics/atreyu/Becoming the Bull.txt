Come on!!!
Grab the bull by the horns the old adage goes.
Nobody tells you where to go from here.
Seems like fates pulling you.
Decisions have to be made.
The the best path is the hardest earned.
Back and forth the struggle consumes us all.
Trying to keep a level head.
In the most unsettling of times.
Today I'll become the bull.
There is so much to stake.
I stumble, I lose my place.
Pride and arrogance surrounded by sin.
Destiny takes its hold.
Fight it or let it go.
But I choose how the day will end.
Back and forth the struggle consumes us all.
Trying to keep a level head.
In the most unsettling of times.
Today I'll become the bull. [x2]
This walk can get lonely
I lose myself inside my head.
No one can touch you when you're outside staring in.
Remove myself from this rat race.
Back and forth the struggle consumes us all.
Trying to keep a level head.
The most unsettling of times.
Today I'll become the bull. [x5]---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
