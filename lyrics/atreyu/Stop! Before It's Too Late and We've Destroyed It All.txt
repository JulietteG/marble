I live, I stalk, I hunt, I eat, 
With indifference for all.
I walk, I kill, I sleep, I breathe, 
Slowly taking control.

The sickest part of our species, 
Ravenous to evolve.
We spread like a fucking disease, 
No vaccine protocol.

And at the end of days, 
This will be our legacy we... 
Kill! Kill! Multiply! 
Till the skies are black and the rivers dry.
Take! Take! Take our time, 
We leave no one else behind.

Kill! Kill! Here tonight, 
Till the skies are black and the rivers dry.
Take! Take! Take our time, 
We leave nothing else behind.

I don't feel anything at all, 
As rats gnaw on my bones.
I'm not made of the same things at all, 
A mechanical heart.

The sickest part of our species, 
Ravenous to evolve.
We spread like a fucking disease, 
No vaccine protocol.

And at the end of days, 
This will be our legacy we... 
Kill! Kill! Multiply! 
Till the skies are black and the rivers dry.
Take! Take! Take our time, 
We leave no one else behind.

Kill! Kill! Here tonight, 
Till the skies are black and the rivers dry.
Take! Take! Take our time, 
We leave nothing else behind.

You cannot stop what never ends.
You cannot stop what never ends.
You cannot stop what never ends.
You cannot stop what never ends.

And at the end of days, 
This will be our legacy we... 

Kill! Kill! Multiply! 
Till the skies are black and the rivers dry.
Take! Take! Take our time, 
We leave no one else behind.

Kill! Kill! Here tonight, 
Till the skies are black and the rivers dry---Lyrics submitted by tony.
