Go
A rush of blood
To my head leaves me winded and wanting
To feel the weakness in my body
Beaten and crushed like my soul
I walked the streets flirting death
But I never kissed back
I'm so lucky so cursed so fucked up
But that's the way that it goes
Its the ebb and the flow
I wish that I could give you my time
Give you my time

Seems that doomsday has come early this year
The last angel has gone
I can't remember the last time I cried
The last angel has gone home

The memories stacking up
And they pull at my guts
What do I have to do to end it
The better days hacked away
Leaving me only pain
This regret is never ending
But in the blink of an eye
This life passes you by
I wish that I could give you my time
Give you my time

Seems that doomsday has come early this year
The last angel has gone
I can't remember the last time I cried
The last angel has gone home

I can't remember
I can't remember
I can't remember the last time I cried

Seems that doomsday has come early this year
The last angel has gone
I can't remember the last time I cried
The last angel has gone home---Lyrics submitted by Anna.
