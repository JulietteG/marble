Don't give a fuck about it
Curl up, I start to doubt this
Something has died in me today (smell the decay)
I need some room around me 
Carve walls until my nails bleed
Don't seal my coffin shut today

Coffin nails, so hard to pull
How can I break free?
From the ties that hold you down
From the grips of loneliness
There's something missing in my life
That I'm running after
Never meant to be held down
All I need is home right now
Cus there's something missing in my life
That I'm running after

Self-doubt breaks down my resolve
It cripples part of my soul
And masterfully I'll hide my pain(smell the decay)
Dead eyes and hollow smiles
Pitch-black my vision is gone
And masterfully, I'll hide my pain

Coffin nails, so hard to pull
How can I break free?
From the ties that hold you down
From the grips of loneliness
There's something missing in my life
That I'm running after
Never meant to be held down
All I need is home right now
Cus there's something missing in my life
That I'm running after

These coffin nails
Are keeping me
From the only thing I need
This monster's holding me
How will I break free?

From the ties that hold you down
From the grips of loneliness
There's something missing in my life
That I'm running after
Never meant to be held down
All I need is home right now
Cus there's something missing in my life
That I'm running after---Lyrics submitted by M..
