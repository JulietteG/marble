Blow the last candle out.
Let the wax harden.
I wish I could stop crying.
I wish that someone still loved me.(x2)

Just breathe and focus.
How can I when the air is so cold and empty,
that my lungs froze right in my chest?
I'll be honest 
the silver linings are getting harder and harder to manufacture, 
and the smiles are so difficult to fake.
I'll be honest 
the silver linings are getting harder and harder to manufacture, 
and the smiles are becoming so difficult for me to fake.

What do I have to do
or who do I have to kill, 
to get what I want... what I need?
What do I have to do
or who do I have to kill, 
to get what I want... what I need?

Happiness is an emotion
I was born to this world without.
Nothing pleases me.
I can never be satiated.
Through this toil I will breed my own distress 
and destroy my best hopes;
fuck up the only things (that I love).

I watched my aspirations crash into the ground 
on the backs of the angels that I've slain. 
But I meant so well;
I tried so hard;
gave every bit of my soul;
to what end?
TO WHAT END!?

Desolation, desire, exhale, pass away.
Desolation, desire, exhale, pass away.
Desolation, desire, exhale, pass on.---Lyrics submitted by Mark Horak.
