Verse:
Resolute a stance of defiance
Always teetering on the brink
Nothing can hold you back when
WHEN YOU'RE NOT HOLDING BACK A THING
Open arms we embrace tomorrow
Closed fists, tarnishing today
We're not afraid to open our mouths and scream:
WE BELIEVE IN WHAT WE SAY

Chorus:
Like a whisper to the dusk
An oath against the shadows, denying the dark
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn
Like a prayer unto the dawn
In arms against the shadows, destroying the dark
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn

Verse:
Covered in sweat and blood
Yet still our heads held high
Actions have consequences
When you live for foolish pride

Been careful not to lose ourselves
Stand together one passion, one hate
We believe in a better tomorrow
We believe in WHAT WE SEE

Chorus:
Like a whisper to the dusk
An oath against the shadows, denying the dark
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn
Like a prayer unto the dawn
In arms against the shadows, destroying the dark
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn

Bridge(x2):
We'll fight our battles
We'll wage our wars
Settle the score with honor and blood
We'll wear our scars like medals of hope
LIKE MEDALS OF HOPE, LIKE MEDALS OF HOPE

Chorus:
Like a whisper to the dusk
An oath against the shadows, denying the dark
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn
Like a prayer unto the dawn
In arms against the shadows, destroying the dark
In arms against the shadows, destorying the dark
In arms against the shadows, destorying the dark
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT 'til the break of dawn---Lyrics submitted by Mannangel.
