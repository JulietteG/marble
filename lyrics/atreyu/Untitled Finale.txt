Chorus: 
You put a bullet in my head
turned black thoughts to red
this could all end in tragedy 
I dream of your death, lay you down to rest 
I wont look back in fond memory

But time marches on, like a soldier, are you a killer 
I think I know what you are, a thief in the night 
and though it's taken me so very long to figure you out 
you're throwing stones, your glass castle is falling down 
on top of your good times, I'm not interested in working this out 

You put a bullet in my head
turned black thoughts to red
this could all end in tragedy 

and that's what you are, a sad plastic fucking mess
don't come to me with how you're
tired, used up and just barely getting by 
because I would walk on by and not even,
not even kick you when your down, 
though you would deserve it because you are lower than the lowest dog
but this is the part where I say good-bye
and let the sands of time blow over us 
Say good-bye, and let the sands of time blow over us 

You've never had to crawl, you've never had to see, 
what it feels like to be so trapped underneath 

the weight of someone's world, comes crashing down on me 

I was longing to be free, I put the bullet in you and me

This is my farewell to you and I, 
this will all end in tragedy (x5)

Woah, this will all end in tragedy. (x4 with fade out)

This will all end in tragedy (x3)

This will all end in tragedy.---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
