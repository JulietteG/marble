I've talked the talk
I've walked the walk
It's taken ten f****** years
For them to see I don't need their approval

I've paid the piper
I've stayed my course
Lived chomping at the bit
With only blood, sweat and tears to adhere to

Open your eyes and see
That it's so menacing
You need to realize
That bleeding is a luxury
Give till there's nothing left
Value in every breath
You need to realize
That bleeding is a luxury

Take it for granted
Forsake the costs
Wear a big shit-eating grin
With only blood, sweat and tears to adhere to

Now bear the burden
To chase your fate
Grind your teeth til' it f****** hurts
So they can see I don't need their approval

Open your eyes and see
That it's so menacing
You need to realize
That bleeding is a luxury
Give till there's nothing left
Value in every breath
You need to realize
That bleeding is a luxury

Seize the day
Take your beatings
Lead the way
Or decay as you fall down

As you fall down

Open your eyes and see
That it's so menacing
You need to realize
That bleeding is a luxury
Give till there's nothing left
Value in every breath
You need to realize
That bleeding is a luxury

It's a luxury

Bleeding is a luxury---Lyrics submitted by M..
