goooooooooooo
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
a wraith with an angels body
a demon with a smile of gold
you soul sucker i wont become like you
a killer with the perfect weapons
crystal eyes and a heart of coal 
you soul sucker i wont lose myself in you
look how pretty she is
when she falls down
no theres no beauty in bleeding mascara
lips are quivering like a withering rose 
shes back again
what the fuck do you think love means
its more than words and more than feelings
sucking me dry
is my marrow that sweet
your dead lovers have left a trail of
broken hearts and misspent hopes
sucking them dry
does their marrow taste of sweetness
sweetness i hope you choke
look how pretty she is
when she falls down
no theres no beauty in bleeding mascara
lips are quivering like a withering rose 
shes back again
shes back a-
shes back again
shes back---Lyrics submitted by Hipi.
