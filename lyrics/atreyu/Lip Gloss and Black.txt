If I gave you pretty enough words
could you paint a picture of us that works
an emphasis on function, rather than design
aren't you tired cause I will carry you
on a broken back and blown out knees
I have been where you are
for a while...

Aren't you tired of being weak
such rage that you can scream
all the stars right out of the sky
and destroy the prettiest starry night
every evening that I die

I am exhumed 
just a little less human
and a lot more bitter and cold

I am exhumed 
just a little less human
and a lot more bitter and cold

I am exhumed 
just a little less human
and a lot more bitter and cold

I am exhumed 
just a little less human....

after all these images of pain
have cut right through you
I will kiss every scar
I'm with you, your not alone
then I'll show you that place
in my chest where my heart
still tries to beat....
It still tries to beat

Aren't you tired of being weak
such rage that you can scream
all the stars right out of the sky
and destroy the prettiest starry night
every evening that I die

Live, love, burn, die
Live, love, burn, die
Live, love, burn, die
Live, love, burn, die.....
