Coward
the next time 
you want to fuck me over
stab me in the front

Can I still see my future in your eyes?

how can I picture myself
stone dead in your embrace
and your cold crimson smile
gives me all i need

no one  can help annul this
free from your withering touch
fuck off like your the only one
whose ever pried open the vault of my love

spare me your pity party
drunk off your own misfortune
by the way why's your voice so
melancholy

can you taste my blood
you knew that this would kill me
but you carried on and on 
with your selfish shit

every one who cared about you
why couldn't you? instead your greed
got both you to steal all the silver linings

burn down my world
you killed my hope
spread out the ash and walk away

how could you just 
close up your eyes
now hear my cry
you are the greatest coward...

common, damn right 
I'm still pissed
next time I see your face 
we'll see 
who has 
the upper hand
kiss my fist
taste the floor
tired of your games
fuck off goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Bert.
