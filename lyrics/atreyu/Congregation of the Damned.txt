I'm gonna give this monster life
I may not have the pieces
I'll keep on going through the night
To see you are left screaming

Face to face
The congregation of the damned
Face to face
Screaming while we can

I get carried away
Lost in a moment
Torn into pieces
A violent display
I'm carried away
Lost in a moment
Searching for answers
I'm lost in the fray

This life's a case of do or die
Sometimes I need no reason
To lose myself in you tonight
Right nows the time to season

Face to face
The congregation of the damned
Face to face
Screaming while we can

I get carried away
Lost in a moment
Torn into pieces
A violent display
I'm carried away
Lost in a moment
Searching for answers
I'm lost in the fray

The congregation of the damned
The congragation of the damned

Face to face
The congregation of the damned
Face to face
We're all screaming while we can

I get carried away
Lost in a moment
Torn into pieces
A violent display
I'm carried away
Lost in a moment
Searching for answers
I'm lost in the fray

I'm carried away
Lost in a moment
Searching for answers
I'm lost in the fray

I get carried away
Lost in a moment
Torn into pieces
A violent display
I'mcarried away
Lost in a moment
Searching for answers
I'm lost in the fray---Lyrics submitted by Marc.
