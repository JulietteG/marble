Almost every day we go to the park
And play the same old tape time and again
It seemed like so perfect at the time
As we sat there watching the boys skateboard by

Come rainy days and we would just stay in
And take your brother's record out for a spin
Music could really knock you over back then
So we would lie on the floor just to be safe

And we play it from the start
Let's relive just the chorus
Can we rewind to the part
Me on drums and you gitarr

I remember buying "Being Boring" back then
And that it was "Killing me softly" on my TV-shop stereo
Seven years on it seemed even Stardust new
Music just sounds better with you

We may just have been kids att the time
But then you had to learn to read between the linear notes
And things sure have changed alot since then
But we stayed on the floor though just in case

Can we play it from the start
Can we relive just the chorus
Let's go back to the part
We still know by heart

Can we play it from the start
Lets rewind to the chorus
Just take it from the part
Me on drums and you guitar

Play it from the start
Play it from the start
Play it from the start
Play it from the start
Play it from the start---Lyrics submitted by Simon.
