Saw you leaning against that old record machine
Saw the name of your band written on the marquee
Its a full moon tonight so we gettin rowdy
Yeah, we gettin rowdy, get-get-gettin rowdy

Feeling like Im a high schooler sipping on a warm wine cooler
Hot cause the party dont stop, Im in a crop top like Im working at Hooters
We been keepin it PG but I wanna get a little frisky
Come gimme some of that, yum like a lollipop, let me set you free

[Chorus:]
Cmon cause I know what I like
And youre looking just like my type
Lets go for it just for tonight
Cmon, cmon, cmon
Now dont even try to deny
Were both going home satisfied
Lets go for it just for tonight
Cmon, cmon, cmon

Write our names on the wall in the back of the bar
Steal some bubble from the corner meximart
Yeah, we laughing like kids causing trouble in the dark
Causing trouble in the dark, tr-tr-trouble in the dark

Feeling like a sabertooth tiger sipping on a warm Budweiser
Touch me and gimme that rush, better pack a toothbrush, gonna pull an all-nighter
We been keepin it Kosher, but I wanna get it on fo sure
Come gimme some of that, yum like a lollipop, baby, dont be scurred

[Chorus:]
Cmon cause I know what I like
And youre looking just like my type
Lets go for it just for tonight
Cmon, cmon, cmon
Now dont even try to deny
Were both going home satisfied
Lets go for it just for tonight
Cmon, cmon, cmon

I dont wanna go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around
I dont wanna think about
Whats gonna be after this
I wanna just live right now

I dont wanna go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around
I dont wanna think about
Whats gonna be after this
I wanna just live right now

Cmon

[Chorus:]
Cmon cause I know what I like
And youre looking just like my type
Lets go for it just for tonight
Cmon, cmon, cmon
Now dont even try to deny
Were both going home satisfied
Lets go for it just for tonight
Cmon, cmon, cmon---
