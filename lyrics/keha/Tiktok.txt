Wake-up in the morning feeling like P-Diddy(Hey what up girl)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gunna hit this city
Before I leave brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
Cause when I leave for the night,
I ain't coming back

I'm talking-- pedicures on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop toping 
Playing our favourite CDs,
goin out to the parties
Trying to get a little bit of tipsy

(CHORUS)
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ Blow my speakers up tonight
Imma fight, til we see the sunlight
Tik Tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop 
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh (x2)

Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up, cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick to the curb unless they look like McJagger
I'm talking about- everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys try to touch my junk, junk
Gunna smack em if he getting to drunk, drunk

Now, now- we go til they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us down

(CHORUS)
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ Blow my speakers up tonight
Imma fight, til we see the sunlight
Tik Tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop 
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh (x2)

Dj--
You Build me up
You break me down
My heart it pounds
Yea you got me
With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound 
Yea you got me

Now the party don't start til I walk in


(CHORUS)
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ Blow my speakers up tonight
Imma fight, til we see the sunlight
Tik Tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop 
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh
Whoa-Oh-Oh-Oh (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
