Dance

Back door cracked, we dont need a key
We get in for free,
No VIP sleeze

Drink that Kool-Aid follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're coming with me.

It's time to kill the lights and
Shut the DJ down.
This place's about to blow - oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Tonight we're taking over
No one's getting out!
This place's about to blow - oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Blow-oh-oh-ho
This place's about to blow
[X3]

Now what? Taking control
We get what we want; 
We do what you don't.
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored
It's time to lose your mind
And let the crazy out
This place's about to (blow)
Tonight we're taking names
'Cause we don't mess around
This place's about to blow - oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This place's about to blow
[X3]

Go
Go go go insane go insane
Throw some glitter
Make it rain on 'em
Let me see them hands
Let me let me see Them hands
Go insane go insane
Throw some glitter
Make it rain on Him
Let me see Them hands
Let me let me see Them hands, hands

We are taking over (blow-oh-oh-oh)
Blow-oh-oh-oh
Get used to it
Blow-oh-oh-oh
This place's about to blow-oh-oh-ho [X3]---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
