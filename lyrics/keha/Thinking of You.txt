Can I hit you later?
Cause its my jam.
Rollin in my beat up,
Gold Trans Am.

Sorry, I cant hear you,
And I got plans.
You wont get me naked,
You had your chance.

I know I said I wouldnt,
Talk about you publicly but,
That was before I caught you,
Lyin and cheating on me, slut!

I was down for you hardcore,
While you were out trying to score,
Found out youre full of it,
Im over it, so suck my dick.

I heard our song on the radio,
And I see your face everywhere I go,
I thought Id call just to let you know,
Ive been thinking of you,
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh.

But now my songs on the radio,
And you see my face everywhere you go,
I thought Id call just to let you know,
Ive been thinking of you,
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh.

So Ive got your message,
Are you having fun,
With your fugly girlfriend?
Ive moved on.

Can I hit you later?
Gotta get to stage,
In a brand new city,
Gettin laid.

I know I said I wouldnt,
Talk about you publicly but,
That was before I caught you,
Lyin and cheating on me, slut!

I was down for you hardcore,
While you were out trying to score,
Found out youre full of it,
Im over it, so suck my dick.

I heard our song on the radio,
And I see your face everywhere I go,
I thought Id call just to let you know,
Ive been thinking of you,
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh.

But now my songs on the radio,
And you see my face everywhere you go,
I thought Id call just to let you know,
Ive been thinking of you,
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh.

Oh! Heard our song on the radio,
And I see your face everywhere I go,
I thought Id call just to let you know,
Ive been thinking of you,
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh.

But now my songs on the radio,
And you see my face everywhere you go,
I thought Id call just to let you know,
Ive been thinking of you,
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh.
