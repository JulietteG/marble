Im in love alri-i-i-ight with my crazy beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends all pretty and plastered
Every night were down to go out
Wakin up on a different couch
Till the next night on the next flight
Yeah I guess were doin alright.

Oh oh ohh
Were fallin in love
Oh oh ohh
Till the suns comin up
Oh oh ohh
Just living the life
Oh oh ohh

Every single night we fight to get a little high on life
To get a little something right, something real, at least we try
Time after time, try dodging all the douche bag guys
Try trading all the wasted times for something real in this crazy life

I just hope some people see theres nothing that Im trying to be
Lettme just stop all the sh*t talk, I know Im the new b*tch on the block
Ive been through my sketchy phases, been broke, been a sh*tty waitress
But im not know, guess it worked out, got here by running my mouth

Every single night we fight to get a little high on life
To get a little something right, something real, at least we try
Time after time, try dodging all the douche bag guys
Try trading all the wasted times for something real in this crazy life

Every single night we fight to get a little high on life
To get a little something right, something real, at least we try
Time after time, try dodging all the douche bag guys
Try trading all the wasted times for something real in this crazy life
