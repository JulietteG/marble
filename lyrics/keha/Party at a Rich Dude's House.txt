swimmin pool, limousines (C'mon let's do it) 
C'mon let's cause a scene (C'mon let's do it) 
Cigar in the caviar (C'mon let's do it) 
I'm pissin' in the Dom P'rignon (C'mon let's do it now) 

C'mon let's do it

C'mon on let's do it 
C'mon on let's do this 

Whoa oh oh oh oh 
There's a party at a rich dude's house 
Whoa oh oh oh oh

So lets whoa oh oh oh oh

No, we are not on the list (C'mon lets do it) 
No, we don't give a shit (C'mon lets do it)

Tonight 

wake up in the front yard 
(We don't care) 
Wine stain on the sofa 
(We don't care) 
I threw up in the closet 
but I don't care 

Cuz we're young 
and we're broke 
and I can't find my coat 

And the sun is coming up 
and oh my god I think 
I'm still drunk. 
Where's my coat? Where? 

There's a party at a rich dude's house 
There's a party at a rich dude's house 

Whoa oh oh oh oh 
There's a party at a rich dude's house 
Whoa oh oh oh oh 
There's a party at a rich dude's house 

If you wanna go 
Then you know, oh 
We're gonna fight till we do it right 

So let's whoa oh oh oh oh 
Tonight---Lyrics submitted by ana.
