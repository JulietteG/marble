I am in love, 
With what we are, 
Not what we should be. 

And I am, 
I am starstruck. 
With every part, 
Of this whole story. 


So if it's just tonight, 
The animal inside, 
Let it live and die. 

Like it's the end of time, 
Like everything inside, 
Let it live and die. 


This is our last chance, 
Give me your hands. 
'Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light. 
The night is fading, heart is racing. 
Now just come and love me like we're gonna die. 

Oh. 


I'm not asleep, I'm up for the fight 
Into the magic. 
And I don't want the concrete. 
I am alive. 
Comes with the tragic. 

So if it's just tonight, 
The animal inside, 
Let it live and die. 


This is our last chance, Give me your hands. 
'Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light. 
The night is fading, heart is racing. 
Now just come and love me like we're gonna die. 

Oh. 


Oh. 
Da da da da da da. 
Oh. 


This is our last chance, Give me your hands. 
'Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light. 
The night is fading, heart is racing. 
Now just come and love me like we're gonna die. Oh. 


Oh. Oh. Oh.---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
