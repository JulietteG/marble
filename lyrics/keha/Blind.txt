[Verse 1]
I think you got the best of me
Youre sleepin with the enemy
You left me all alone alone alone alone

The beat drops; Im so low
My heart stops; I already know
You left me all alone alone alone alone

[Chorus]
Im sick and tired of the mess you made me
Youre never gonna catch me cry (oh whoa)
You must be blind if you cant see
Youll miss me till the day you die (oh whoa)

Without me
Youre nothing (oh whoa)

You must be blind if you cant see 
Youll miss me till the day you die (oh whoa)

[Verse 2]
Ive let go; finally over you
This drama that you put me through
Im better all alone alone alone alone

The beat drops; youre so low
Its last call and its gotten old
Now look whos all alone alone alone alone

[Chorus]
Im sick and tired of the mess you made me
Youre never gonna catch me cry (oh whoa)
You must be blind if you cant see
Youll miss me till the day you die (oh whoa)

Without me
Youre nothing (oh whoa)

You must be blind if you cant see 
Youll miss me till the day you die (oh whoa)

[Bridge]
I trusted you
You were the first
Then you lied
And it gets worse
You broke me down
Now just look around
Whos all alone?
Whos all alone now?

[Chorus]
Im sick and tired of the mess you made me
Youre never gonna catch me cry (oh whoa)
You must be blind if you cant see
Youll miss me till the day you die (oh whoa)

Without me
Youre nothing (oh whoa)

You must be blind if you cant see 
Youll miss me till the day you die---Lyrics submitted by Megan.
