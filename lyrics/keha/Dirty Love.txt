[Intro]:
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
It's Iggy Pop!
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Yeah, and Ke$ha.
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh!
All right!
Get up!
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Yeah!
Rah!

[Verse 1]:
Dont want your money,
I got my own.
Youre not my daddy,
Baby, Im full grown.
Dont complicate it.
Dont tell me lies.
Im not your girlfriend.
I aint never gonna be,
Oh, your wife.

[Chorus]:
Oh whoa,
I just want your dirty love.
Oh whoa,
I just want your dirty love.
All I need is to get,
In between your sheets.
Oh whoa,
I just want your dirty love.
(I just want your dirty love.)
I just want your dirty love.
(I just want your dirty love.)

[Verse 2]:
Cockroaches do it,
In garbage cans.
Rug merchants do it,
In Afghanistan.
Santorum did it,
In a V-neck sweater.
Pornos produce it,
But wild child can do it better.

[Chorus]:
Oh whoa,
I just want your dirty love.
Oh whoa,
I just want your dirty love.
All I need is to get,
In between your sheets.
Oh whoa,
I just want your dirty love.
(I just want your dirty love.)

[Bridge]:
Oh whoa,
I-I-I dont want your fancy things.
I just want your love.
(I just want your love.)
Oh whoa,
Champagne tastes like piss to me.
I just want your love.
(I just want your love.)
Oh whoa,
Keep your leopard limousine.
I just want your love.
(I just want your love.)
Oh whoa,
I just want your fucking filthy love.

[Chorus]:
Oh whoa,
I just want your dirty love.
Oh whoa,
I just want your dirty love.
All I need is to get,
In between your sheets.
Oh whoa,
I just want your dirty love.
(I just want your dirty love.)
I just want your dirty love.
(I just want your dirty love.)
I just want your dirty love.
(I just want your dirty love, dirty love, dirty love.)---Lyrics submitted by Matt J.
