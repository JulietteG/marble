There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free for all

When the dark
Of the night comes around
That's the time
That the animal comes alive
Looking for
Something wild

And now we lookin' like pimps
In my gold Trans-Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag
My drunk text on
I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight
I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

There's a place downtown, 
Where the freaks all come around.
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free for all

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody take it off

Lose your mind
Lose it now
Lose your clothes
In the crowd
We're delirious
Tear it down
'Til the sun comes back around

N-now we're getting so smashed
Knocking over trash cans
Errybody breakin' bottles
It's a filthy hot mess
And im gonna get faded
I'm not the designated
Driver so
I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free for all

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show.
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor.

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody take it off

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Everybody take it off
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Everybody take it off

Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Ohh
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off

Everybody take it off

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free for all

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody take it off---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
