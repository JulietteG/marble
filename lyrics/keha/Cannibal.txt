I have a heart, I swear I do
But just not, baby, when it comes to you
I get so hungry
When you say you love me
Hush, if you know what's good for you

I think you're hot, I think you're cool
You're the kind of guy I'd stalk in school
But now that I'm famous
You're up my anus
Now I'm gonna eat you, fool

[Pre-Chorus:]
I eat boys up
Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty
I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal
I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run

[Chorus:]
I am cannibal
I am cannibal
I'll eat you up
I am cannibal
I am cannibal
I'll eat you up


Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
That's when the hunger really hits me
Your little heart goes pitter patter
I want your liver on a platter

Use your finger to stir my tea
And for dessert I'll suck your teeth
Be too sweet, and you'll be a goner
Yep, I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh
Oh ooh whoa oh

[Chorus]

I love you
I warned you
