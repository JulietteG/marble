last night i had enough of you, i put on the brakes 
and i could tell you took it hard, it was all over your face 
that you were slippin and flippin, but here is the sitch 
i signed up for a man but you are just a bitch 

you should know that i love you a lot 
but i just can't date a dude with a vag 

when we fell in love you made my heart drop 
and you had me thinkin bout you nonstop 
but you cried bout this and whine about that 
when you grow a pear you can call me back 

yeah i think you're hot, i think you're alright 
but you're actin like a chick all the time 
you were cool and now you're not, just like that 
when you grow a pear you can call me back 

when i first met you (panties droppin) 
every time i saw you (it was on and) 
one day you asked if we could just talk 
and that's the reason why i'm walkin 

if i am honest, i'm just not hooked on your phonics 
i'm not tryin to be rude or crude 
i just wanted one thing from you 
and you got confused 

you should know that i love you a lot 
but i just can't date a dude with a vag 

when we fell in love you made my heart drop 
and you had me thinkin bout you nonstop 
but you cried bout this and whine about that 
when you grow a pair you can call me back 

yeah i think you're hot, i think you're alright 
but you're actin like a chick all the time 
you were cool and now you're not, just like that 
when you grow a pear you can call me back 

when you grow a pear you can call me back 
when you grow a pear you can call me back 
grow a pear you can call me back 
when you grow a pear you can call me back 

grow a pear you can call me back 
and no, i don't want to see your mangina 
when you grow a pear you can call me back 

when we fell in love you made my heart drop 
and you had me thinkin bout you nonstop 
but you cried bout this and whine about that 
when you grow a pear you can call me back 

yeah i think you're hot, i think you're alright 
but you're actin like a chick all the time 
you were cool and now you're not, just like that 
when you grow a pear you can call me back---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Nicole.
