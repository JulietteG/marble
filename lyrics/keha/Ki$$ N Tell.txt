Listen to yourself
You're a hot mess
St-t-stutter through your words
Breaking a sweat
What's it gonna take to confess
What we both know
Yeah, I was outta town last weekend,
You were feeling like a pimp round your lame friends
Now your little party's gonna end
So here we go

Woohha-a-ohooh
You got a secret
woohha-a-ohooh
You couldn't keep it
woohha-a-ohooh
Somebody leaked it,
And now some sh*ts about to go down

Never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't
Kiss 'n' tell
You really should've kept it in your pants
Hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't
Kiss 'n' tell

Your looking like a tool not a bawler
Your acting like a chick, why bother?
I can find someone way hotter
with a bigger wow... well
'Cause I'm done with the ways thats you've messed up
You weren't smart enough to keep your stupid mouth shut
I'm so sick of it
I've had enough
I hope you cry

Woohha-a-ohooh
You got a secret
Woohha-a-ohooh
You couldn't keep it
Woohha-a-ohooh
Somebody leaked it
And now some sh*ts about to go down

Never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't
Kiss 'n' tell
You really should've kept it in your pants
Hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't
Kiss 'n' tell

Kiss 'n' tell (x8)

I hope you know
You gotta go
You
Get up and go
I don't wanna know
Or why your gross
You gotta go,
You
Get up and go
'Cause i dont wanna know

I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't
Kiss 'n' tell
You really should've kept it in your pants
Hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't
Kiss 'n' tell

Maybe you shouldn't
Kiss 'n' tell---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
