I was a just a young kid,
With time to waste.
Living out of my car,
Those were the days.

We were all the wild ones,
The wasted youth.
Other than a dream,
Had nothing to lose.

Aint it funny how time flies?
Fades into gold.
Now I wanna do a drive-by,
But I cant find the road.

Back to wonderland,
Where it all began.
Everything was so simple then,
Living life like our last weekend,
Wish I could find my way,
Back to wonderland.

Carries in the valley,
Shes got a kid.
Julies still a waitress,
Livin' on tips.

Sometimes we get together,
And shoot the shit.
But its not the same now,
No, nothin' is.

Feels like it was a movie,
That plays in my mind.
Shadows of a past life,
Wish I could rewind.

Back to wonderland,
Where it all began.
Everything was so simple then,
Living life like our last weekend,
Wish I could find my way,
Back to wonderland.

Didnt have a clue,
What we were doing,
Or where we would end up.
Living off of nickels,
And dimes and our,
Young reckless love.

We didnt ever think,
That time would,
Ever come to an end
Now if I could,
You know Id run.

Back to wonderland,
Where it all began.
Everything was so simple then,
Living life like our last weekend,
Wish I could find my way,
Back to wonderland.---Lyrics submitted by Tiffani Carter.
