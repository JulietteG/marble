Hot and dangerous 
If you're one of us then roll with us 
'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love 
When we got our hot pants on and up 

And yes of course we does 
We runnin' this town just like a club 
And no you don't wanna mess with us 
Got Jesus on my necklace (uz-uz) 

Got that glitter on my eyes 
Stockings ripped all up the side 
Looking sick and sexy-fied 
So let's go uh oh 
Let's go 

Tonight we're going hard hard hard ha ha hard 
Just like the world is our our our ah ah ours 
We're tearing it apar par par pa pa part 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are 

We're dancing like we're dumb dumb duh duh duh dumb 
Our bodies going numb numb nuh nuh nuh numb 
We'll be forever young young yuh yuh yuh young 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are 

DJ turn it up 
It's about damn time to live it up 
I'm so sick of being so serious 
It's makin' my brain delirious 

I'm just talkin' true 
I'm tellin' you 'bout the shit we do 
We're selling our clothes 
Sleepin' in cars 
Dressin' it down 
Hittin' on dudes 
Hard 

Got that glitter on my eyes 
Stockings ripped all up the side 
Looking sick and sexy-fied 
So let's go uh oh 
Let's go 

Tonight we're going hard hard hard ha ha hard 
Just like the world is our our our ah ah ours 
We're tearing it apar par par pa pa part 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are 

We're dancing like we're dumb dumb duh duh duh dumb 
Our bodies going numb numb nuh nuh nuh numb 
We'll be forever young young yuh yuh yuh young 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are 

DJ turn it up 
DJ turn it up 
DJ turn it up 
DJ turn it up 

Tonight we're going hard hard hard ha ha hard 
Just like the world is our our our ah ah ours 
We're tearing it apar par par pa pa part 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are 

We're dancing like we're dumb dumb duh duh duh dumb 
Our bodies going numb numb nuh nuh nuh numb 
We'll be forever young young yuh yuh yuh young 
You know we're superstars 
We are who we are
