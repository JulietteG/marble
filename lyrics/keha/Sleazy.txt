I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends.
I don't need love, looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

(Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy,
Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy,
Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy
Ima get,
Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy,
Ima get,
Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy, Oh!)

[Chorus:]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
And I don't need love, looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
And I don't need love, looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

You can't imagine the immensity of the fuck
Am I kidding about you money and man servant and the mansion you live in
And I don't wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle, some boys and let's take it back to my basement
And get Sleazy
Sick of all your lines, so cheesy!
Sorry daddy, but I'm not that easy!
I'm not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it on my tit
Ima take it back to where my man and my girls is

(Sleazy, Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy,
Get Sleazy,
Cause ima get Sleazy,
Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy, Get Sleazy,
Cause Ima get)

[Chorus:]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
And I don't need love, looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
And I don't need love, looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

Rat tat tat tat on your dum dum drum
The beat so phat, gonna make me cum, um, um um, um
(Over to your place!)
Rat tat tat tat on your dum dum drum
The beat so phat, gonna make me cum, um, um, um, um
(Over to your place!)

I don't mean to critique on your seduction technique
But your money's not impressing me, it's kinda weak
That you really think you're gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off
But showing me that dollas in your drop box
Me and all my friends we don't buy bottles, we bring em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave em
And I don't care if you stare and you call us scummy
Cause you ain't a figure of affection
And sure as hell not your money hunny

[Chorus:]
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
And I don't need love, looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
And I don't need love, looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

Rat tat tat tat on your dum dum drum
The beat so phat, gonna make me cum, um, um um, um
(Over to your place!)
Rat tat tat tat on your dum dum drum.
The beat so phat, gonna make me cum, um, um um, um
(Over to your place!)---Lyrics submitted by Hilary.
