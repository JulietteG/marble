I lie awake at night consumed by tragedy
I feel depression's cold hand reaching out for me
All I've ever wanted was your honesty
But now the words, become the blade that you have driven into me

I don't need your sympathy

I know you're alone tonight, with tears you cry
I hope you're satisfied, and yeah I'm doing fine
Now baby it could be fun, to fire your gun
I promise not to run
You can't kill me

I feel your venom as it's flowing to my brain
Weak in the knees but I am loving all the pain
Look into your eyes, I let the trigger rest the blame

I don't need your sympathy

I know you're alone tonight, with tears you cry
I hope you're satisfied, and yeah I'm doing fine
Now baby it could be fun, to fire your gun
I promise not to run
You can't kill me

You can drain my blood, but you, you can't kill me (kill me)
You can steal my heart (my heart), but you (but you), you can't kill me
Tonight I sleep, I dream of anything but you, you

You are alone tonight, with tears you cry
I hope you're satisfied, and yeah I'm doing fine
Now baby it could be fun, to fire your gun
I promise not to run
You can't kill me---Lyrics submitted by janet.
