She drips down the walls while I unravel like a web
My body quivers in the silence as she chains me to the bed

Sit back, let the, chemicals find their way into my head tonight
She's my lover, and I'm a victim
I'm not an addict, and I hope I can shake it

She'll scream my name
She'll take everything
If I can play her game
I can stay

She drips down the walls while I unravel like a web
My body quivers in the silence as she chains me to the bed
She wants all of the glory
The latest story of my life, is that the devil's at my door tonight

Get down, let's dance, while I melt in your hands
Take back everything you said tonight
She's my angel, and I'm the wicked
I've got a feeling and I hope I can fake it

She'll scream my name
She'll take everything
If I can play her game
I can stay

She drips down the walls while I unravel like a web
My body quivers in the silence as she chains me to the bed
She wants all of the glory
The latest story of my life, is that the devil's at my door tonight

It's not what I expected
I'm too young to disappear
If I don't turn around and try to fight this never-ending fear
I've lost this battle but I'm still in the war
And I'm trying, but the devil's at my door

She drips down the walls while I unravel like a web
My body quivers in the silence as she chains me to the bed
She wants all of the glory
The latest story of my life, is that the devil's at my door tonight---Lyrics submitted by janet.
