Listen to me cause I'm not faking
This time it's real and I can't take it
Hold me gently cause I might fall apart
There were no bullets so stop searching
The cause is you and all your making
Stop pretending that you're innocent

Cause now I remember that...

I saw you with the murder weapon
You see me as an enemy
Choke on your tongue as you pray that this is all just a dream
And fall before me

I'm down but I can still comprehend 
How this broken two step dance went
You shot me
I couldn't remember who told me what you were after
I'm seeing red now, the world is blurry
Tonight will be my last for turning
How does it feel to know

Cause now I remember that...

I saw you with the murder weapon
You see me as an enemy
Choke on your tongue as you pray that this is all just a dream
And fall before me

I'm on a search for the arsonist
Who set me ablaze and thought they'd escape
Put me out, put me out I'm begging
Make your move, you know I'm waiting
My strength comes from my memories

I'm on a search for the arsonist
Who set me ablaze and thought they'd escape
Put me out, put me out I'm begging
Make your move, you know I'm waiting
My strength comes from my memories

And now I remember that...

I saw you with the murder weapon
You see me as an enemy
Choke on your tongue as you pray that this is all just a dream
I saw you with the murder weapon
You see me as an enemy
Choke on your tongue as you pray that this is all just a dream
And fall before me---Lyrics submitted by janet.
