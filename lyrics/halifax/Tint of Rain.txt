If I could make it to my funeral, I'd scan the crowd for you
While all the speeches spill my life as suicide
I'd buy a ticket from the scalper just to show I hate the system
And you soon know I didn't really care at all

Now I'm alive

So you can watch me from the heavens as I rain down on your head
Tell me what you've always wanted and I'll give you love instead
And when I wake up from this dream, it's you that I'll regret
If I have to break a promise to you, I'll break my hand instead

You thought that I'd put down my pen but instead
I put down the pills that keep me from the edge of breaking down 
in the back of this hotel room
I saw you standing in the corner of court
With a fist full of evidence that led to this 
whole situation of me and my plea for insanity

I'll take you on
Now I'm alive
I'll take you on

So you can watch me from the heavens as I rain down on your head
Tell me what you've always wanted and I'll give you love instead
And when I wake up from this dream, it's you that I'll regret
If I have to break a promise to you, I'll break my hand instead

If I could make it to my funeral, 
I'd smile to the crowd and say to dry your tears cause I'm finally alive

So you can watch me from the heavens as I rain down on your head
Tell me what you've always wanted and I'll give you love instead
And when I wake up from this dream, it's you that I'll regret
If I have to break a promise to you, I'll break my hand instead---Lyrics submitted by janet.
