Remember remember the times when we were younger, 
when we shed our tears many times close together. 
Remember remember the days left behind, 
and the words lost between us in the valleys of time. 
Remember my friend now remember my lover, 
when I told you that I'd never recover. 
And remember the cold stormy weather, 
and the promise I made I'd love you forever. 
I meant it I swear that I meant it forever. 

If my eyes are the oceans that put your head in the clouds then your heart is the reason I keep my feet on the ground. 
I've just watched the world turning, kept my head held up high, kept my feet on the ground, kept the hope in my eyes. 

I mean't it I swear that I meant it and mean it, 
and after that time I will always repeat it, 
I love you I swear and I won't let you go, 
that's something I really need you to know. 
Remember my friend now remember my lover when I told you that I would never recover? well... 

If my eyes are the oceans that put your head in the clouds then your heart is the reason I keep my feet on the ground. 
I've just watched the world turning, kept my head held up high, kept my feet on the ground, kept the hope in my eyes. 

I love you I swear and I won't let you go, 
that's something that I really need you to know. (x2)
And then you embraced me with your entire being, and we were carried away off to a peaceful sea...

If my eyes are the oceans that put your head in the clouds then your heart is the reason I keep my feet on the ground. 
I've just watched the world turning, kept my head held up high, kept my feet on the ground, kept the hope in my eyes.---Lyrics submitted by Elwin Hu.
