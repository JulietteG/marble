Well I know there's been times when I wished I would die, 
but I swear yeah I swear oh I swear I'm past that, 
and I'll swear if you will that I will not look back, 
yeah I swear if you will that I will not look back. 

Take a deep breath now, pass the shallows, 
stay steady and hold on, through the darkness we all know. 

And I swear yeah I swear yeah I swear if you will, to hold onto life, yeah I'll hold on if you will...

So on to the ocean and into the sea, so balanced and calm now, that's where I will be. 
So on to the ocean and into the sea wash away all my problems wash away memories.

Back then - always through the shattered glass 
I stared at my life, and oh I wished I would die, 
but I swear yeah I swear oh I swear I'm past that - is this all what it seems - 
I cant believe that I made it. 
Take a deep breath now, pass the shallows, 
stay steady and hold on, through the darkness we all know - 
And I swear yeah I swear yeah I swear if you will, to hold onto life, 
yeah I'll hold on if you will...

So on to the ocean and into the sea, so balanced and calm now, that's where I will be. 
So on to the ocean and into the sea wash away all my problems wash away memories.

Take a deep breath now, pass the shallows, 
stay steady and hold on, through the darkness we all know.

And I swear yeah I swear yeah I swear if you will, to hold onto life, yeah I'll hold on if you will...

So on to the ocean and into the sea, so balanced and calm now, that's where I will be. 
So on to the ocean and into the sea wash away all my problems wash away memories.---Lyrics submitted by Elwin Hu.
