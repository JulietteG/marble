i didnt grab my pen tonight
to reck your name or start a fight
its just a couple things i want to say to you
and i knew you wouldnt sit downjust to hear
but let me spell it out for ya deaf ears
it sad to say that the hear says more then truth

your everything that everybody warned about
who am i to tell you what to do 
your not the type to do what your told 
but let me tell you your gonna miss this heart of gold
you seem to breath for bitter endings
the only time that you hands can hold 
but let me tell you your gonna miss this heart of gold

shut up long enough
to hear what i have to say just once
we're not gonna talk about it later now is the time
theres nothing every where you've been
you run from nine to nine again
i wont be here tomarrow but you just might

your everything that i can live my life without
who am i to tell you what to do 
your not the type to do what your told 
but let me tell you your gonna miss this heart of gold
you seem to breath for bitter endings
the only time that you hands can hold 
but let me tell you your gonna miss this heart of gold

your gonna miss this
yeah you gonna miss this face 
gonna miss these kisses

who am i to tell you what to do 
your not the type to do what your told 
but let me tell you your gonna miss this heart of gold
you seem to breath for bitter endings
the only time that you hands can hold 
but let me tell you your gonna miss this heart of gold

yeah yeah
who am i 
oh your gonna miss this
heart of gold yeah 
heart of gold
the only time that ypur hand can hold 
let me tell you your gonna miss this heart of gold---Lyrics submitted by lizzie.
