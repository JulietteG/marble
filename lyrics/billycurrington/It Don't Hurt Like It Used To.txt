I had a couple beers with one of my friends
Told him just how our story ends
Did all I could to try to make it work
But you drug my heart through the Alabama dirt.

I've been out the house, climbin' them walls
Checkin' that calendar, exin' days off
Hit another bar, call another friend
Throw a few down, tell the story again.

Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay.
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.

I'm finally gettin' out back into the world
Life is good, I'll marry a girl
She got a beautiful heart, eyes are blue
I don't hardly ever think about you.

Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay.
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.

Sometimes I find peace of mind in a bottle of wine
Sometimes I break down and cry.

Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay.
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you.

Hey, hey, what can I say?
I can just lie and say it's all okay.
Oh-ho, what can I do?
Been goin' through Hell gettin' over you
But it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.
No it don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.

It don't hurt, it don't hurt like it used to.---
