A woman is mystery
 A man just can't understand
 Sometimes all it takes to please her
 Is the touch of your hand
 And other times you gotta take it slow
 And hold her all night long
 Heaven knows there's so many ways
 A man can go wrong

[Chorus:]
 Must be doin' something right
 I just heard you sigh
 You leaned into my kiss
 And closed those deep blue need you eyes
 Don't know what I did
 To earn a love like this, but baby, I
 Must be doin' something right

Anywhere you wanna go 
Baby, show me the way
 I'm open to suggestions
 Mmm, whatever you say
 Tonight's about giving you
 What you want, whatever it takes
 Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
 And judging by the smile on your face

[Repeat Chorus]

Ah, Baby
 Mmm...

I don't know what I did
 To earn a love like this, but baby, I
 Must be doin' something right
 Must be doin' something right---Lyrics submitted by lorin.
