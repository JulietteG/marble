Use a lighter hand, I've got bruises you can't see
you can take your time, your love is all I need
They say time is a healer
but it's been no friend to me

I've had my share of heartache, I've had my fill of pain
Girl you took away the hurt and stopped the falling rain
I know you walk on water
I know that you can heal me

Heal me with your sweet and sexy ways
Feel me, your touch is all I crave
I've been waiting for so long for you to come along 
and heal me

Girl don't cut yourself on my broken heart
Watch the jagged pieces they might tear you apart
Oh once you touch my soul
I know you can heal me

Heal me with your sweet and sexy ways
Feel me, your touch is all I crave
I've been waiting for so long for you to come along
And heal me
Oh, heal me
Won't you heal me
Oh, heal me

Stars are all aligned, they're in perfect harmony
Love is the potion that you pour on me

Heal me with your sweet and sexy ways
Feel me, your touch is all i crave
I've been waiting for so long for you to come along
And heal me
I've been waiting for so long for you to come along
And heal me
Oh heal me, won't you heal me---Lyrics submitted by angela.
