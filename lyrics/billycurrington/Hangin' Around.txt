You're the last thing that I cling to
Before I fall asleep at night
You're the first thing that I reach for
In the early morning light

Chorus:
You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh,I wish you could have been more like
Your memory and kept hangin' around

You're that tap on my shoulder
You're that voice in the crowd
You're that constant distraction
You're that book I can't put down

Repeat Chorus

You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh,I wish you could have been more like
Your memory and kept hangin' around

It keeps haunting me,I still want and need you,always will
You're every thought I think,every sight I see
Every feelin' I have

Repeat Chorus

You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh,I wish you could have been more like
Your memory and kept hangin' around

You're the last thing I wish for
When I lay down at night---Lyrics submitted by Amanda.
