Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's a bad night
To go downtown
Amateur night
Too many tourists around

It's a bad night
To go for a drive
Speed traps
Don't wanna get a DUI

It can just be you and I
Kicking our shoes off
Listening to some Clapton yeah

Do-do-do-do-do-yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-yeah

It's a good night
For falling in love
It's the right time for sipping
A little bit of whiskey
And it's a good night
For slowing it down
Throw some wood on the fire
Let the flame burn higher, yeah

It's the perfect night
For dancing in the kitchen
If you're hungry
We'll make a little breakfast
For dinner

It's just about to get good
You don't wanna leave now
(Come over)
Come a little closer
Let me show you how

It's a good night
For falling in love
It's the right time for sipping
A little bit of whiskey
It's a good night
For slowing it down
Throw some wood on the fire
Let the flame burn higher

Mmmm, oooo, oh

It's a bad night
(It's a bad night)
For breaking hearts
(For breaking hearts)
You gonna break mine
If you leave me alone
In the dark

But it's a good night
For falling in love
It's the right time for sipping
A little bit of whiskey
It's a good night
For slowing it down
Throw some wood on the fire
Let the flame burn

It's a good night
For falling in love
It's the right time for sipping
A little bit of whiskey
And it's a good night
For slowing it down
Throw some wood on the fire
Let the flame burn higher, yeah

(It's a good night baby)
(For falling in love)
Yeah, it's a good night
For falling in love
Ooo-woah-woah-woah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah---
