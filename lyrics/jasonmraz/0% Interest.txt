well our friends on the front porch,
where they're telling jokes and they swing on,
swiftly towards happier times
they're expending the lines
and finding more energy for the effort
and getting distance from that front porch spotlight

but us, we found peace in the shadows
long enough to see the monsters rise
candy's got some space to fill in her daydreams
living high on yesterday's lies
talking to me about some 0% interest
and how she got a better deal than the next guy

and the way the lightning shocked us,
when we were lost and we were looking
down that long missouri highway
your hair was longer then and now I can remember
see, now well i remember oh, so well

oh, the roads unencumbered by cats
they're burning like wet matches through my miracle mile mind
you left your thumbprint inside me now for months it seems
but mine only brushes your soft surface
and somehow, somehow it leaves me listless,
my tongue curls under my lips, oh yes

so I cant speak to tell you of the months before I met you
and the way the truth it locked us
right about the time after the lightning shocked us
when we were young, when we were young and missing

round that small new england byway
our lives they were sheltered then
and I now I can remember
say now, i remember so well
almost too well

well its not even being about that anymore
I gotta get you down
those tiny fragments of perfection, they please me in a time
unchanged, when its not the same beginning
or along awaited end

if I knew all the words, I would write myself out of here
if I was all the colors, I would paint you pretty in gold in a picture
so I'm told little sister
so now I'm sold little sister

why don't you tell me about the sunsets in sweden,
and the laws of eden
and how you were the rock of gibraltar,
and how they called you foxy

well that's another whole box of pandoras,
that's another whole box of them ties

slide your foot off the gas
before we crash right back into the median
right back into the median, the median
it separates our house
from the middle of the street

it separates our house
on the middle of the street---Lyrics submitted by Lea.
