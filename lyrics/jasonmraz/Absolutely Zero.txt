You. You were a friend. You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night
You see how it was my fault. Of course it was mine.
Im too hard at work. Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life.
Im sorry for wasting your time.

Who am I to say this situation isnt great? Its my job to make the most of it
Of course I didnt know that it would happen to me. Not that easy.

Hey whats that you say? Youre not blaming me for anything thats great
But I dont break that easy. Does it fade away?
So thats why Im apologizing now for telling you I thought that we could make it
I just dont get enough to believe that weve both changed.

Who am I to say this situation isnt great? Its my time to make the most of it
How could I ever know that this would happen to me, not that easy, no

All along the fault is up for grabs why dont you have it
Well its for sale go make your offer, Ill sell it for no less than what I bought it for
Pay no more than absolutely zero.

Well neither one of us deserves the blame because opportunities moved us away
And its not an easy thing to learn to play a game thats made for two thats you and me
The rules remain a mystery. See it can be easy.

Who am I to say this situation isnt great? Its our time to make the most of it
How could we ever know that this would happen to me, not that easy, no
All along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it
Well its for sale go make your offer, Ill sell it for no less than what I bought it for
Pay no more than absolutely zero.---Lyrics submitted by ando.
