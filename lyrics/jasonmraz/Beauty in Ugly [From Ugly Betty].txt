She's so big-hearted
But not so remarkable.
Just an ordinary, humble girl;
Expecting nothing as we're made to think
It's a pretty person's world.

But you are beautiful and you better go show it,
So go look again.
You gotta be true to your own
If you really wanna go to the top,
Do you really wanna win?
Don't believe in leaving normal
Just to satisfy demand.

(Chorus):
Well if you wanna get free
And if you wanna do the passionate thing
And if you wanna get smart for the sake of your heart and all,
You should own your name and stand up tall.
So get real,
And see the beauty in ugly.

You are fresh
Your face is fabulous.
Don't forget, you're one of a kind.
When nobody's checkin' the deeds you've done
And nobody's hearing your cries.
You make all the fashion statements just by dressing up your mind.

And if you wanna get free
And if you wanna do the passionate thing
And if you wanna get smart for the sake of your heart and all,
You should own your name and stand up tall.
And get real,
And see the beauty in ugly.
And see the beauty in ugly...

Well if you wanna get free
And if you wanna do the passionate thing
And if you wanna get smart for the sake of your heart and all,
You should own your name and stand up tall.
And get real,
And see the beauty in ugly.
And see the beauty in ugly.---Lyrics submitted by Jordy.
