Courage is the triumph of the soul
I know where I wanna walk; I know where I wanna go
So come put your hand in mine
Everybody's welcome

Music is what God wants us to do
Sing a song for me; I'll sing a song for you
When we put our voices together,
We create a harmony

And we create the love a love a love; love a love a love a love a love a love
Its love a love a love, love a love a love a love a love a, la la love
All I want to share with you is all my love, its all I really care to do

Champion the idea of one love
All people the same
One beautiful race
Making a home of this beautiful place
And be grateful for the precious gifts of life
Sunshine and Water
Food from the greatest giver

Anything you want can be yours at anytime
Anything you want can be yours at anytime

Its love a love a love, love a love a love a love a love a love
-It's what I got to give you now-
It's love a love a love, love a love a love a love a love a, la la love
All I want to share with you, it's all I know, it's all I really care to do
Anything you want can be yours at anytime
All I want to share with you is all my love, its all I really care to do
Anything you want can be yours at anytime
Anything you want can be yours at anytime

Champion the idea of one love
All people the same
One beautiful race
Making a home of this beautiful place
And be grateful for the precious gifts of life
Sunshine and Water
Food from the greatest giver

Anything you want can be yours at anytime
Anything you want can be yours at anytime

Its love a love a love, love a love a love a love a love a love
-It's what I got to give you now-
It's love a love a love, love a love a love a love a love a, la la love
All I want to share with you, it's all I know, it's all I really care to do
Anything you want can be yours at anytime
All I want to share with you is all my love, its all I really care to do
Anything you want can be yours at anytime
Anything you want can be yours at anytime
