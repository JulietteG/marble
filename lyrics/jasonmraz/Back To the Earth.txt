Whenever my head starts to hurt
Before it goes from bad to feeling worse
I turn off my phone, I get down low
And put my hand into the dirt

I try to stop the world from moving so fast
Try to get a grip on where I'm at
To simplify this dizzy life
And get my feet in the grass

I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to work her
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back

The only explanation for a high rise
Must that everybody wants to get high
Move on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky

The higher we go, the taller we grow
We lose sight of our land below
You can have you place, up in outer space
Cause my home is where my food is grown

I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to work her
I'm going back to the earth

We are animals
We are wild
We started with a motion at the bottom of the ocean
now its ringing from the tops of the trees

We are animals
We are wild
And to truly be forgiving we must all get back to living
with the land in harmony

I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back

I listen to the whistle in the wind
Its blending in with the song of the birds
The messages remind me who I am
That I'm a child of the earth

It's where I found spirituality
It's in everything that surrounds me
I can't spell God G-O-D
I spell it N-A-T-U-R-E

I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back to work her
I'm going back to the earth
I'm going back---
