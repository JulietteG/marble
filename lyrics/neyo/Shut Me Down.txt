May not be what you think you want
I dont fit your mode of affection
Using me breaks so many hearts
Which explains your constant rejections

But I know
When its real
And I wanna show you girl
But everytime that I try
Shut me down
Shut me down

Shut me down down down
Shut me down down down
Shut me down down down
Shut me down down down

For what its worth Im in love with you
Said for what its worth Im in love with you
For what its worth Im in love with you
Said for what its worth Im in love with you

You believe that Im messing around
That it cant be real what Im saying
But Ive never felt what I feel right now
So believe me girl I aint playing

But I know
When its real
And I wanna show you girl
But everytime that I try
Shut me down
Shut me down

You shut me down down down
You shut me down down down ---Lyrics submitted by catia.
