The way you switch little mamma so thick I'm so sick
Body like a shotgun (bang) she's  hot one clock ohh click
And she knows it measurement 36 24 45 (wooo) and your aware 
you a problem girl i'm tired of hearin it yeah (yeah)

Shorty I don't wanna waste your time
It ain't no secret baby girl you fine
And you can have anybody here that you want thats right
Includin this fella cause your a diamond and I dig your shine

But i don't gotta tell u that
you know you look good(girl u know u fly)
so i don't gotta tell u that (nooo) cause i know u hear it all the time

Don't wanna gas u up but it ain't like can just pass u up
so mean ur strut u make a dude wanna cash u up
but that ain't how i do u look good but i ain't gon buy u
said i just wanna try u hit my cell if its cool to slide through

Shorty i don't wanna waste your time
It ain't no secret baby girl u fine
And you can have anybody here that u want thats right
Includin this fella cause ur a diamond and i dig your shine

But i don't gotta tell u that 
you know u look good(girl u know u fly)
So i don't gotta tell u that(nooo) cause i now u hear it all the time

Shorty i don't got no games
Ain't got no false or playa way for me to say
That girl u are off the chain
But i'm sure (baby) 
I'm sure u knew that anyway
