Verse 1:
42nd street, 4am
I'm rolling slowly no
destination in mind
Driver looking at me strange cuz I got in (in)
Handed him a lot of cash
Sat back and told him just drive (drive)
I'm thinkin bout the day 
you packed your things and left
Sayin you knew all about Chanel,
Tiffany, Tracy, Stephanie
You went away, 
so I'm writing in the fog upon the window to express myself 
and how I'm feelin

Chorus:
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely (lone)
Y, L, E, N, O, L
As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all
That means I'm lonely

Verse 2:
I see a woman walking with her man (man)
man with his woman
Smiling as they stroll into this little bar (Bar)
As they kiss each other holding hands
I get sick to my stomach
So jealous of how f*ing happy they are
lucky B*stards
There's a couple different people I could call right now
But the one I'm wanting don't want me at all right now
And that hurts
through my heart, my mind, and my soul (soul)
Rolling in this cab 
writing on the window
Singing Y

Chorus:
Y, L, E, N, O, L
(Y,y) As I roll past you in this taxi cab
If you care at all
(what it means is I'm)
that means I'm lonely (lonely)
Y, L, E, N, O, L (O,L,O,L)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab (in this taxi cab)
If you care at all (if you care at all)
That means I'm lonely 

Bridge:
What am I supposed to do now
Rolling round, feeling like a fool now (ha ha hoo)
Cryin like a b*it*h in the back of this taxi cab
So used to it (ha ha hoo)
Driver tries to ask if I'm alright
I say "Never mind, mind your business and just drive dammit (haha hoo)
You don't know nothing about how I feel right now, let me spell it out"
(Y)

Chorus:
Y, L, E, N, O, L (O, L)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab (Past you in this taxi cab)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely (Means I'm lonely, means I'm lonely baby) (Ohh)
Y, L, E, N, O, L (O, L)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab (in this taxi cab)
If you care at all (If you even give a damn baby)
That means I'm lonely (That means I'm lonely, it means I'm lonely, oh)

Y, L, E, N, O, L (What it means baby)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab (Said I'm sorry that I did you wrong)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely (And I'm lonely without you, I miss you baby) (Ohh)
Y, L, E, N, O, L (L)
As I roll past you in this taxi cab (Taxi cab)
If you care at all, that means I'm lonely (That means I'm lonely baby, lonely baby, oh oh oh)---Lyrics submitted by allie.
