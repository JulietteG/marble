(Ooh)
For the way you changed my plans
For being the perfect distraction
For the way you took the idea that i had
Of everything that I wanted to have
You made me see there was something missing
(Oh yeah Oh)
For the ending of my first begin
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
And for the rare and unexpected friend
Oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
For the way you're something that I'd never choose
But at the same time something I don't wanna loose
I don't ever wanna be without ever again

Chorus:
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So, when you appeared, I had no idea
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
See now it's so clear I need you here always
(Oh yeah)

My accidental happily ever after (Woah)
The way you smile and how you comfort me
With your laughter
I must admit you weren't a part of "My Book"
But, now if you open it up and take a look
You're the beginning and the end of every chapter
(Ooh)

Chorus:
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So when you appeared, I had no idea
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
See, now it's so clear (its so clear) I need you here always

Who knew that I could be? (Who knew that I could be?)
So unexpectedly (so unexpectedly)
Undeniably happy. Oh so with you
Right here right here next to me!

Chorus:
You're the best thing I never knew I needed (Woah)
So when you appeared, I had no idea
You're the best thing I never knew I needed (I needed, woah)
See now it's so clear, I need you here always

Now it's so clear, I need you here always!---Lyrics submitted by raven.
