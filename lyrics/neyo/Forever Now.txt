Was gonna give you these flowers tonight
Was gonna ask you to stay
Practiced so that I would say it just right
But now there are no words to say

As I watch you kiss him softly
The same way you kissed me
I scream what am I gonna do with forever now
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?

All the plans we made don't work if you're not around
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?

What do I do now?

What do I do now?

In slow motion I led these flowers in the ground
And right before I turn to leave 
I watch you kiss him softly 
Then look up and see me
I scream what am I gonna do with forever now
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?

All the plans we made don't work if you're not around
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?

What do I do now?

Everything you said we would be
All the things you said we'd do
I had all my life around the thought of me and you

And I scream what am I gonna do with forever now
What do I do? What do I do now?
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do? What do I do now?

All the plans we made don't work if you're not around
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?

What do I do now?

What do I do now?

What do I do now?

What do I do? What do I do now?

What do I do now?

What do I do? What do I do now?

What do I do now?---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
