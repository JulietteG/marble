Close the doors
Lay down
No, no, no, not like that
Like this, yea... I like that
OK, now here's what I want you to do
I want you to look me right in my eyes
And I want you to tell me exactly what you want me to do to you
You ready?

Your body whispering from under the sheets
I hear it moaning begging loud and clearly
I'm rather fluent in the language it speaks
But it's your mouth I want to tell it to me

Girl, why don't you
Tell me what you want me to do to you
Say it, say it, say it...
Girl why don't you tell me what you want from me
Girl won't you
Say it, say it, say it...

It's not as if I'm not totally aware
That you want my hands right here and my mouth right there
Girl don't play shy, show me how bold you can be
Open your mouth and tell me where you want me

Girl, why don't you
Tell me what you want me to do to you
Say it, say it, say it...
Girl why don't you tell me what you want from me
Girl won't you
Say it, say it, say it...

Tell me what you want.
Oh, you want that?
Say the word.
Turn around

Anything that you want baby tell me you want it
I got it babe
Tell me what you want
No more hoping and wishing
Name your position
I got it babe
Tell me what you want and I got it babe
Anything that you want baby tell me you want it
I got it babe
Tell me what you want
No more hoping and wishing
Name your position
I got it babe

Girl, why don't you
Tell me what you want me to do to you
Say it, say it, say it...
Girl why don't you tell me what you want from me
Girl won't you
Say it, say it, say it...---Lyrics submitted by Shela.
