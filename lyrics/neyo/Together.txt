Since the day that we met girl
I've never had anyone make me feel this way
And my heart is sure it wants to be with you
Wanna give you the whole world ohh
If you make the promise to me, your gonna stay
Without you guiding me, I'm lost and so confused

What will it take to show you I'll be by your side
Girl I got you and I want to give you what you never had
Girl everyday I hope to make you part of my life
Cause you know me and I know you
Girl your love is where it's at..ohhh

I'm gonna be the love that's gonna last
And be the one that got your back
Ain't nothing never that bad
That we will be together
Girl we both made our mistakes
And some we never wished we made
But we'll be okay if we just stick together

Oooh..I know he left you stranded
And you paid the price when you messed up your life
Girl I know you're so afraid but I can't right the wrongs he did
I know you saw the lipstick on my window
And wonder how many chicks been to my home
I done my share of playing games
But for you I given up that life

What will it take to show you I'll be by your side

Girl I got you and I want to give you what you never had
Girl everyday I hope to make you part of my life
Cause you know me and I know you
Girl your love is where it's at..ohhh

I'm gonna be the love that's gonna last
And be the one that got your back
Ain't nothing never that bad
That we would be together
Girl we both made our mistakes
And some we never wished we made
But we will be okay if we just stay together

Baby you're the one I'm waiting for
Because you give me what I needed more
girl its clear that we are meant to be
Together we should be together
Eternally..Ooohh
And I'm gonna be.

I'm gonna be the love that's gonna last
And be the one that got your back
Ain't nothing never that bad
That we would be together
Girl we both made our mistakes
And some we never wished we made
But we'll be okay if we just stick together

I'm gonna be the love that's gonna last
And be the one that got your back
Ain't nothing never that bad
That we would be together
Girl we both made our mistakes
And some we never wished we made
But we will be okay if we just stick together ---Lyrics submitted by Ariibah syifaa.
