Hey, Im not the one to start no trouble
Im not one to throw no salt
But you standing out here crying
I watched as that dude drove off
Assuming that thats your man
Assuming that youre just fault
I dont know the whole story, but assuming it wasnt your fault

[Chorus] x2
Baby since he just wont do it right, oh
Let me be the one, let me show you what real love is like
And do the things he should have done

Let me be the one
Now I know that you dont know me
But hear what Im talking bout
Cause when I look at you what I see
Is worth tryina work it out
Now I dont know him so I cant say that hes a bad dude
But is he really trying, I think not
And all Im saying is if he wont make the effort
Let me give it a shot

[Chorus] x2
Baby since he just wont do it right, oh
Let me be the one, let me show you what real love is like
And do the things he should have done

Uhu, uh, let me be, what you want
Let me be, what hes not
Let me show, you real love
Cause real love is all I got
Uh, come on in, out the rain
Come let me, do it right
Come let me, change your heart
And change your life, whoa
Girl let me be, the one, be the one
Girl let me be, the one, be the one
Girl let me be, the one, be the one
Girl let me be, the one, be the one
Uh la la, la la la la, la la la la la
Uh la la, la la la la, la la la la la

[Chorus] x2
Baby since he just wont do it right, oh
Let me be the one, let me show you what real love is like
And do the things he should have done---
