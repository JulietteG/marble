she looks so cute in that white dress
at the far end of the asile
standing where i should be standing
some other man know his face and his smile 
i jus walked in sat down silent
i stood outside for a while
wonderin why did i come here
face it you messed up and now she's with somebody else( yeah yeah)

and now all i can do is smile and fade into the background(ho,oh,ho,oh)
ill say congradulations and ill fade in the background

such a lovely reception
i sit and sippin Rose'
then we catch eyes for a second
both of us smiled and then we looked away
its funny you dont know what you got(you dont)
til you aint got it no more(mm)
put down my glass grabbed a bottle
i thorw it back and i shout "she's with somebody else"

and now all i can do is smile and fade into the background(ho,oh,ho,oh)
ill say congradulations and ill fade in the background(background,
background,background,background,background)
sure hate to fade into the background(ho woh woh, ho woh woh,ho woh woh)
ho woh woh woh woh(ho woh woh)
ho woh woh(ho woh woh)
ho woh woh(ho woh woh)
shes with somebody else

and now all i can do is smile and fade into the background(ho,oh,ho,oh)
ill say congradulations and ill fade in the background---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
