Hello (hello), good evening (yeah)

Came in here, shut the world out
Nothing to get into, nothing to be about
Just grab a little bite, quiet little night
By no means looking for miss right
But hello (hello), good evening
Clearly she was out with her girls alone (that I could tell)
Beautiful without any make-up on (so natural)
The kind that make you wanna put the games away
Think about the future but first Ill say
Hello (hello), good evening

Oh miss right (miss right)
What are you doing here
Oh miss right
Wasnt expecting you tonight (oh oh)
Oh miss right (miss right)
How bout we disappear (yeah)
Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life
Oh miss right (yeah yeah)

But aint it amazing
Spend forever looking, all the time wasting
Soon as I throw my hands up and say I quit
Turn the corner and there my future sits
Hello (hello), good evening (good evening)
Clearly she was out with her girls alone (that I could tell)
Beautiful without any make-up on (so natural)
The kind that make you wanna put the games away
Think about the future but first Ill say
Hello (hello), oh good evening

Oh miss right (miss right)
What are you doing today
(what are you doing baby)
Wasnt expecting you tonight (oh oh)
Oh miss right (miss right)
How bout we disappear
Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life

Please forgive me if Im forward
But this chance wont pass me by
See Im looking at forever
And its the most beautiful thing Ive seen in my life

Ooh ooh miss right (miss right)
What are you doing here
(Said what are you doing here baby)
Wasnt expecting you tonight
(I wasnt expecting you tonight)
Oh miss right
How bout we disappear (disappear babe)
Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life

(The rest of my life ai ai, life ai ai)
Miss right
What are you doing here
(The rest of my life ai ai, life ai ai)
Wasnt expecting you tonight
Miss right
How bout we disappear
Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life

Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life---Lyrics submitted by tiana mitchell.
