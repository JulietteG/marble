[Fabolous:]
You know things dont ever go as they should, (oh oh no, oh oh no)
dont you hater coot her with a shooter nigga, (oh oh no, oh oh no)
coot the day what a day why you shoot her nigga, (oh oh no, oh oh no)

If I had a dollar for every shoot beat you know how reach I would be
like they say it is what it is, now what it could be,
cant cry feel guilt over spilt milk,
Im too fly, Im too cool, word to Versace silk,
and my watch be filled with mad diamonds
I got good watches just bad timing
the chick I met at the club was cute,
still feel like Im game brain from the substitute,
cause this aint you and I aint me,
plan you happy then why youre so mad at me,
cant hold on of what you had just what you got,
you should be here, but youre not.

[Chorus - Ne-Yo:]
Im doing here, oh yeah, what I do myself I would not do, oh
its 4.15 am I shouldnt have drink in reminiscent on you, oh
and how I used to let you smoking then no I dont
you get blow then we both get low
as I lay with them girl I dont know
cause the back of my mind one million time
I tell myself it should be you, should be you
right now, tell it should be you, should be you,
should be you and me right now uhh.
Should be you, ahh.

As I watch her sleep, all that I can think
she is beautiful but shes not you
love is just a night, then out of my life
damn why can I just do right, when you told me you want easily
I pretended it didnt hurt me,
but ever late here I can hardly breathe,
laying next to she when in reality, it should be

[Chorus - Ne-Yo:]
It should be you, oh, should be you, should be you
should be you and me, right now, right now
said it should be you, should be you,
should be you and me, right now aha
uhh uhh should be you, should be you baby ahh

Uh it shine the day when I know now and there was always somehow,
wish that was somewhere that I could go bad,
its obvious and theres no doubt,
made a mistake and Im down and now,
uh girl it should be.

[Diddy:]
You try to south,
my life lights camera fame in action,
feeling dreams from all this proper planes Im cashin
willing to trade all the flashy chains Im flashin for a night
back up for us, exchangin pain in passion,
romances, tryin to like the fame of those he used to ride,
cause its tryin to open up and slice suicide,
God teaches lessons every day,
use all I needed like met them every day,
the sun dont shine forever
any time that we fall I just need to climb together,
guess we avoided when we couldnt went through
that dont change the fact that it shouldbe been you.

Girl its should be you

[Chorus - Ne-Yo:]
It should be you, oh, should be you, should be you
should be you and me, right now, right now
said it should be you, should be you,
should be you and me, right now aha
uhh uhh, I said it should be you, it should be you baby ahh

Should be you, should be you, should be you oh---
