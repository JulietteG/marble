[Spoken]
Let me talk to 'em
I guess you know you made it when they start talking 'bout you, right?
Welcome to fame
You all don't pay me no mind, I just gotta get some stuff off my chest
Listen

Young, energetic, famous but don't really sweat it
Rich enough, fairly hot - so basically sex is not:
Difficult to get
That ain't my fault, naw naw
Listen

And just 'cause I might take advantage once or twice
People tell me I'm not right, thinking that sex was my life
But that just ain't me
So let me clear it for those who have obviously misread the code
Listen to me now

NO
I
AM
NOT
I'm not ADDICTED TO SEX
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be

NO
I
AM
NOT
I'm not ADDICTED TO SEX
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be yeah

I won't 'pologize for being just a little freaky
I can't help it, it's just in me
But a problem it is not
I'm just fine you all
Don't worry bout me
Listen
And I won't 'pologize
For being blessed with the ability to satisfy accurately
And quickly find the spot
It's a gift and a curse
Don't mess around - find my number
In your girlfriend's purse
NO
I
AM
NOT
I'm not ADDICTED TO SEX
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be

NO
I
AM
NOT
I'm not ADDICTED TO SEX
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be yeah

I never been shy 'bout my self and sexuality
Never been taboo (never been taboo but if I)
Have to live without
I know it's something I could do
But I just really don't want to

NO
I
AM
NOT
I'm not ADDICTED TO SEX
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be

NO
I
AM
NOT
I'm not ADDICTED TO SEX
But girl I guarantee that if you lay with me
You just might be yeah---Lyrics submitted by Shela.
