Caught up in the whirlwind, Im just a dragonfly and
And my wings aint helping me
Im in a little trouble, sure didnt see this coming tonight
Have no clue what Im gonna do now
And ask me who put me in this way
Ask me whos responsible for this, she is
She is, everythings all her fault
Caught up in the whirlwind and no one can help me
Ask me whos responsible for this, she is
She is, everythings all her fault
So now Im in love and I didnt wanna be
And all because of she, whoa
And all because of she, whoa

Days aint long enough, nights are even shorter
This aint fair
Time dont wanna give me what I need
All Im asking is forever, forever and a moment
Listen to me this aint how I turned
I dont know what she done to me
But I like
And ask me whos put me in this twist
Ask me whos responsible for this
She is, everythings all her fault
Caught up in the whirlwind and no one can help me
Ask me whos responsible for this, she is
She is, everythings all her fault
So now Im in love and I didnt wanna be
And all because of she, whoa
And all because of she, whoa

Said its getting hard for me to picture me without you
For every passing day baby
But its easy to win to whos the owner of my heart
Sent me look at you and say, she is
She is, everythings all her fault
Caught up in the whirlwind and no one can help me
Ask me whos responsible for this, she is
She is, everythings all her fault
So now Im in love and I didnt wanna be
And all because of she, whoa
And all because of she, whoa---
