Okay
I woke up in heaven today
She kissed me I floated away, away
Never felt anything so great, mmm

Alright
Now I'll brace myself for the fights
Something must go wrong cause it's way to right
I'm light as a feather tonight, yeah yeah

Cause I can't feel the ground
Someone let me down
I've never felt so high as I do now
It's too good to be true
I don't deserve you
I've never felt a love strong enough to
Stop this world from spinning
Stop this world spinning, yeah yeah

And I see
Heaven when she looks at me
In her smile is the most amazing dream
And in her eyes I fall asleep, oh whoa

And i hope, oh
Hope that she can see through the smoke
Of my imperfections into my soul
And my heart where she has control
She has control

Cause I can't feel the ground
Someone let me down
I've never felt so high as I do now
It's too good to be true
I don't deserve you
I've never felt a love strong enough to
Stop this world from spinning',hey hey hey
Stop this world spinning


Happiness like this can never last ( can never last)
turns into the memories of the past (turns into the memories of the past)
Here today and gone just as fast (oh, gone just as fast)

And I can't feel the ground
Someone let me down
I said I've never felt so high as I do now
It's too good to be true
I don't deserve you ooh
I've never felt a love strong enough to
Stop this world from spinning, hey hey hey
Stop this world spinning---Lyrics submitted by ray.
