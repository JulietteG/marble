(I asked you a question)
I feel a rise burning in the back of my head
If she could kill me with a look, I'd already be dead
Excited at the thought of possibly two in my bed
I said some shit that I instantly regretted I said
I hid my deception with absolute discretion
Wanted to turn around and give up an accidental confession
I turned to look at her and she's just standin' there
Facial expression says it all, war has been declared

She said, is there anything you wanna tell me?
I'm standin' there with my head down and I'm thinkin'
Oh no, here we go
What the hell was I thinkin'? Man I wish I was drinkin'
So I could blame it on the liquor, why did I paint the picture?
Why did I think it was something that she wouldn't even consider?
Now I'm avoidin' eye contact as if I owe her money
Tryna laugh it off, clearly she don't think it's funny

And then she stepped to me, comin' so steady
Looked at me like she knew already
I betrayed her trust, it weighs heavy
On my head, and then she said
Why can't I be loved?
Why can't I feel love?
Why am I not worthy of
Oh why can't I feel love?

All she wanted was somethin' real, somethin' true
With tears in her eyes she said, "I believed in you"
I said, "Please don't leave, please don't go away"
She said, "You broke my heart. How could I stay? "
It'd be a year before I'd see integrity again
(Over there, they said he's over there
I see him, there he is
Ne-Yo! Is this dude what are you doing?
Bruh don't you know you got a show in 10 minutes from now?
You drinking before, what is you doing?)
Relax, I'm not drunk
Guess who I ran into today---
