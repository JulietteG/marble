Marie, 
it's hard to see you give 
yourself away 
like that
even though 
I'm one of those
who chooses to take

No, it ain't right
but what's done is done

There will be no riots
in the streets
no one to scream 
your name
cause you have always
been there
and you will remain 
Marie

Marie, 
the trees have stopped growing
and the water's turning black
they might call it love
but they want you for something
you'll eventually lack 
I hear the sound
of steel slowing steel
the platform comes in view

They're taking you away
on that evening train

But there will be no riots
in the streets
no one to scream 
your name
cause you have always
been there
and you will remain 
Marie

Oh, sweet Marie
Sweet Marie
Oooh,
Sweet Marie,
sweet Marie---Lyrics submitted by Maria.
