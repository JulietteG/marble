Cheater man
Cheater where did you sleep last night
Cheater man, who was holding you tight now, I want to know
Ill be glad when all your wild oats are sown
And maybe then you will bring your sweet lovin home, now
oh bring it on home to me baby

Cheater man
Im gonna burn your little black book
Cheater baby, Im gonna learn how to cook now, yes I am
Im gonna feed you them cornbread and peas
And keep you home so I can love you til youre weak in your knees, yeah
Thats what Im gonna do baby

Cheater man
Honey we can patch it up
Cheater baby, you got to do some catching up now, yes you have
You been spinning your wheels, and gettin no traction
Brilliant idea, come on home to the action, yes
you got to come on home baby

Cheater man!
Oh where you been!
Cheater man!
Just bring it on in!
Cheater baby!
You know I love you!
Cheater baby!
Oh come on home!
Cheatin on me!
Thats what you been doing!
Cheatin on me!
But come on home---Lyrics submitted by Abbie Barrett.
