Never Quit until the clock stops
And never die out until your heart drops
Successes what separates you from the have-nots
And have all of these haters at your neck like an ascot

You can do it too young world
I remember being exactly like you young girl
But wait, you can do it to young man
See you'll be fine as long as on your own two you stand

Keep on living
Keep on breathing
Even when you don't believe it

Keep on climbing
Keep on reaching
Even when this world can't see it
No, impossible is nothing

Even when you don't believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world can't see it
Impossible is nothing

Got to hate to not have it
More than you'd love to obtain it
Your future's around the corner
So close you can almost taste it

It get worse before it's better
That storm you gon' have to weather
Either be a busted pipe
Or a diamond due to this pressure

25 hours 8 days out the week
Focus, keep eyes open, victory never sleeps
My prayer for you is that you hit all them goals you tryna' reach
I even hope at one point that you take it further that me

Keep on living
Keep on breathing
Even when you don't believe it

Keep on climbing
Keep on reaching
Even when this world can't see it
No, impossible is nothing

Even when you don't believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world can't see it
Impossible is nothing

I shall never let them see me sweat
Promise to want for more until my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trial for the next
And never sell out my soul for any number on a check

I shall never let them see me sweat
Promise to want for more until my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trial for the next
Just promise me when I'm gone you wont forget

Keep on living
Keep on breathing
Even when you don't believe it

Keep on climbing
Keep on reaching
Even when this world can't see it
No, impossible is nothing

Even when you don't believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world can't see it
Impossible is nothing---
