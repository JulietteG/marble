(feat. M)

Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it

Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby
High price, but Im worth it, baby
Cant play with ya, Ive been busy workin, baby
Gettin faded in the European swervin night
Look, describe Iggy, groundbreaking what the word is
Hit the stage, yeah, shake it like Im nervous
When in New York got me parking right on Madison
This aint no accident, Im killing them on purpose
I-G-G-Y, think she just had to do it better
Ride with me, fly livin, there aint nothin to it
Am I waist slim ass fat you gotta have it
Get my bake on, cake long
Thats automatic

I know you like the way I turn it on
Im out here with my friends
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it
If you dont do this right, youre going home alone
I guess youll have to beg
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it

P-p-pussy power, pay me by the hour
I need me a Braveheart, cant deal with a coward
I tell him if he aint ballin, he should hit the showers
If I peek and you lucky, baby, theres money hours
All yellow gold on me, like Im Trinidad, James
Sittin drop top wonder where the students at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new thang, baby, I aint feeling that now
Iggy Iggy Iggy, cant you see?
That everybody wanna put their hands on me
See I be on this money why your man on me?
And I need another hand with all these bandz on me

I know you like the way I turn it on
Im out here with my friends
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it
If you dont do this right, youre going home alone
I guess youll have to beg
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it

Get up out my face like who dyou think you are
Talking all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah
(Oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh)
Get up out my face like who dyou think you are
Made me wanna laugh like har-de-har-de-har
(Oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh) na ha

I know you like the way I turn it on
Im out here with my friends
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it
If you dont do this right, youre going home alone
I guess youll have to beg
Imma make you beg, Imma make you beg for it

Beg for it, boy, Im like a drug
If you want my love better smoke it up
(Make you beg for it, Imma make you beg for it)
You can look, boy, but dont you touch
If you want my love make me give a fuck
(Make you beg for it, Imma make you beg for it)---
