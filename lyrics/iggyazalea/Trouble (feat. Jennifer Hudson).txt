Right, I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
Cuz most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, tryna figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
Cuz oo you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

Don't you come here thinkin' you ballin'
Ain't down for it, you seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean, and the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn so fresh and clean, smells like trouble to me

Opposites attract, I guess this is that
Good girl, bad guy waht a perfect match
And if we ooo, you gon' want to pay back tithes
Cuz when you finish you gon' feel like you was baptized
See baby now you fiendin' for a test drive
Cuz you don't wanna lose your ride to the next guy
And baby trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

Don't you come here thinkin' you ballin'
Ain't down for it, you seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean, and the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn so fresh and clean, smells like trouble to me---
