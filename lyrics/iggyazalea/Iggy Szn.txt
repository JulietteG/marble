(Hey hey, wait, could you hold on)

Everywhere I go they say its Iggy Szn
Til I get what I want, baby I aint leaving
Everytime I go out everybody wanna show out
I just see a girl in the mirror
Told her, you the reason

Simmer down bitch, its Iggy Szn
Simmer down bitch, its Iggy Szn
I aint worried bout shit, its Iggy Szn
Bad bitches scream Yas
Its Iggy Szn

Every man needs some Azalea
You want it, you do what I tell you
You play on my team and get a ring back
You dont, you gon end up a failure
I look like a fantasy, your wifey mad at me
Just cause hubby is a fan of me you wanna stand me
So skip the talking baby, we too busy balling baby
Pedal to the metal and my engine never stalling baby
Bitches gon hate, while the critics critique
I paid them no mind whenever they speak
What they make a year, I can make in a week
I know you cant stand it just get you a seat
See the sky be the limit when you dealing with me
Im stunting this hard, and I aint even reached my peak
I just get money to spend it, let the cycle repeat
Im feeling like I got this world on my feet
Hm, Iggz

Everywhere I go they say its Iggy Szn
Til I get what I want, baby I aint leaving
Everytime I go out everybody wanna show out
I just see a girl in the mirror
Told her, you the reason

Simmer down bitch, its Iggy Szn
Simmer down bitch, its Iggy Szn
I aint worried bout shit, its Iggy Szn
Bad bitches scream Yas
Its Iggy Szn

(Go Iggy, go Iggy, go Iggy, go Iggy, go)

You aint down to make a purchase, tell me whats your purpose?
Go out and play somewhere, the grown folks busy working
Iggy independent whether they know that for certain
You be on the internet, thirsty, prolly worse in person
Down payment for a car, I dropped that on a Birkin
You dont sit in VIP cause you aint no important person
Money wrapped around my mind like a turban
Iggy got them pop titties but that ass on that urban
If I told you what Im worth, you would throw up
So have my money on time before I show up
Im drinking PJ on a PJ in my PJs
Thinking money 25/8, no free days
If your girl down bout it, I recruit them
They ask me who you do it for, me say they
Damn right, I like the life I live
Who else you know that slay like Iggz, little bitch

Everywhere I go they say its Iggy Szn
Til I get what I want, baby I aint leaving
Everytime I go out everybody wanna show out
I just see a girl in the mirror
Told her, you the reason

Simmer down bitch, its Iggy Szn
Simmer down bitch, its Iggy Szn
I aint worried bout shit, its Iggy Szn
Bad bitches scream Yas
Its Iggy Szn

Drop down on em, bring em back up
Iggy Igg in the building, call for backup
See I dont want nothing but them stacks
So if you see a bad bitch
Point her out, where she at though?
Im clap, clap, clap, clapping on em
Im clap, clap, clap, clapping on em
So we dont ever wanna turn down
So go ahead and get ratchet on em

Everywhere I go they say its Iggy Szn
Til I get what I want, baby I aint leaving
Everytime I go out everybody wanna show out
I just see a girl in the mirror
Told her, you the reason

Simmer down bitch, its Iggy Szn
Simmer down bitch, its Iggy Szn
I aint worried bout shit, its Iggy Szn
Bad bitches scream Yas
Its Iggy Szn---
