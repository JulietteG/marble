Break down the walls
Let love prevail.
Pour out Your truth.
Teach us Your ways oh God.
Teach us Your ways oh God.
All Your sons and daughters reaching out

[Chorus:]
Let us rise, Let us rise
Make us one, we cry.
Let us love like You love, let us rise.
Every tongue, every tribe
Every heart unified, let us rise.

Humbly we stand
Longing for change.
Bring us to You.
Show us Your heart oh God.
Show us Your heart oh God.
All your sons and daughters reaching out

[Repeat Chorus:]

Let us rise unto the nations
With the story of a Savior
Who has come to bring His children home.
Let us sing across the waters
With a voice in one accord
We are Yours, we are Yours, we are Yours.

[Repeat Chorus:]---Lyrics submitted by liz.
