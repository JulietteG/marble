Time is running out,
Come save.
Death is creeping in,
Come save.
We humble ourselves and seek your face
Pour out your mercy like rain

Your sons and your daughters
Cry for you.
The waves of the waters
Reach for you
And all of creation rises up
And screams out your name
Oh Lord, come save

Addicted to our pride
Come save
Consumed in self delight
Come save
Break us and free us
From these chains
We desperately need your grace

Your sons and your daughters
Cry for you.
The waves of the waters
Reach for you
And all of creation rises up
And screams out your name
Oh Lord, come awaken us from our sleep
Come bring us to our needs
Come whisper truth in our ears
Come save

Your sons and your daughters
Cry for you.
The waves of the waters
Reach for you
And all of creation rises up
And screams out your name
Oh, Lord,
Your sons and your daughters
Cry for you.
The waves of the waters
Reach for you
And all of creation rises up
And screams out your name
Oh Lord, come save.
Come save.---Lyrics submitted by liz.
