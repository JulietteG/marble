[Verse 1]
E-e-e-extra, extra
E-e-extra, extra, extra, e-e-extra, extra, extra, e-e-e-extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra
You got this issue girl
With the things that you've been sayin'
Ain't tryna diss you girl
But I'm done with the games you're playin'
I tell you all the time
Stay up out my biz'
But you can't mind your own
And thats what the issue is

[Chorus]
So when you see that its all good
And act like everything's gonna be fine
But when you see me with my boy
You do the same thing you do all the time
You be like
'Where he at? And where you go? And who's that textin' and who you callin'?'
And I won't take it personally cause you just hate on eveythin'
She's on the extra, extra
You can read all about it
She's got an issue
With me bein' wit you
She on the extra, extra
Why you gotta be so extra, extra
She on the extra, extra
Why you gotta be so extra, extra

[Verse 2]
You make excuses sayin'
That he doesn't love me
I'm on the phone with him
And you're behind me sayin'
'You act like you're the police of our love
But you're tryna mess it up
You let us fall back, get off of my back'

[Chorus]
So when you see that its all good
And act like everything's gonna be fine
But when you see me with my boy
You do the same thing you do all the time
You be like
'Where he at? And where you go? And who's that textin' and who you callin'?'
And I won't take it personally cause you just hate on eveythin'
She's on the extra, extra
You can read all about it
She's got an issue
With me bein' wit you
She on the extra, extra
Why you gotta be so extra, extra
She on the extra, extra
Why you gotta be so extra, extra

[Verse 3]
Jacque Nimble, Jacque Nimble
Let me put these chicks in their place real quick
Uh, instrumental, instrumental
Is what I'm about ta pick (?) when I spit on this
Extraordinary flow, hysterio everywhere we go
I'm the track, Jacque, Mandy, Mo
Is like go-go gadgets inspect the show
We bout to blow, respect the dough
Cause its so incredible, when the School Gyrls comin' to the party yo
Its just one thing that we got to know
Why you gotta be so extra, extra (x3)
Always so extra

[Chorus]
She's on the extra, extra
You can read all about it
She's got an issue
With me bein' wit you
She on the extra, extra
Why you gotta be so extra, extra
She on the extra, extra
Why you gotta be so extra, extra
She's on the extra, extra
You can read all about it
She's got an issue
With me bein' wit you
She on the extra, extra
Why you gotta be so extra, extra
She on the extra, extra
Why you gotta be so extra, extra---Lyrics submitted by brianna.
