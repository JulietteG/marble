12 days, Oh Oh Oh
12 days (to fall in love)

(Chorus)
12 days ain't enough for us to fall in love
I'm dreaming of you day and night
Tell me baby what we didn't do right
Cause' we were kissing under the mistletoe
But lonely when we had to go

Baby 12 days (12 days)
12 days, (aint enough) aint enough to fall in love

Verse 1

On the 1st day of christmas, 
I was by myself, It was only me
On the second day of Chistmas, 
I met you downtown
By the Christmas Tree

On the 3rd and 4th day of christmas,
You were on my mind
By day 6, I got to admit
I wanted to give us a try (Oh Boy)

(Chorus)
12 days ain't enough for us to fall in love
I'm dreaming of you day and night
Tell me baby what we didn't do right
Cause' we were kissing under the mistletoe
But lonely when we had to go

Baby 12 days (12 days)
12 days, (aint enough) aint enough to fall in love

Verse 2 

On the 7th day of Christmas, 
Boy, I swear, we were both feeling like 
were both skating on ice
Me and You
You and Me
Kissing under the red and green lights

By day 10, I knew then
You would soon be gone
Baby, this can't be
Why this had to happen to you and me

(Chorus)
12 days ain't enough for us to fall in love
I'm dreaming of you day and night
Tell me baby what we didn't do right
Cause' we were kissing under the mistletoe
But lonely when we had to go

Baby 12 days (12 days)
12 days, (aint enough) aint enough to fall in love

Bridge

The time moves on and so will we
Until next Christmas, I'll see you in my dreams
I will hold on (hold on)
To our memories (our memories)
Memories (Nooooo)

(Chorus)
12 days ain't enough for us to fall in love
I'm dreaming of you day and night
Tell me baby what we didn't do right
Cause' we were kissing under the mistletoe
But lonely when we had to go

Baby 12 days (12 days)
12 days, (aint enough) aint enough to fall in love
