[Verse 1]
Only been fourteen days since I met him
I've been tryin' thirteen days to forget him
But we're stuck together like the up and the 7
Feels like something bit me and I think I like the venom
My friends all say he's trouble
Put him on my myspace comments double, double, double, double
Why they tryna burst my bubble?
Don't they know I just can't leave him alone

[Chorus]
So tell me what I gotta do to get this boy's attention
Now I'm in trouble from the text message I sent him
Only just one more thing that I forgot to mention
Where'd you meet him
I met him in detention
I-I-I met him (x3)
I met him in detention
I-I-I met him (x3)
I met him in detention

[Verse 2]
Six classes a day not a single one wit him
Tell me how am I supposed to have fun wit him
Always was a good girl, now I've gone bad
Interupting teachers in the middle of the class
Fightin' back a smile but she give me that slip
Money in the bank that I'm leavin' on my trip, trip, trip
When Mom and Dad find out, they're gonna flip
Don't they know I just can't leave him alone?

[Chorus]
So tell me what I gotta do to get this boy's attention
Now I'm in trouble from the text message I sent him
Only just one more thing that I forgot to mention
Where'd you meet him
I met him in detention
I-I-I met him (x3)
I met him in detention
I-I-I met him (x3)
I met him in detention

[Verse 3]
Tell me what I gotta do, do, do, do detention
Now I'm in trouble, trouble, trouble, I sent him
Only just one more thing, thing, thing, thi-thi-thing, to mention
Where'd you meet him
I met him in detention

[Chorus]
So tell me what I gotta do to get this boy's attention
Now I'm in trouble from the text message I sent him
Only just one more thing that I forgot to mention
Where'd you meet him
I met him in detention
I-I-I met him (x3)
I met him in detention
I-I-I met him (x3)
I met him in detention---Lyrics submitted by brianna.
