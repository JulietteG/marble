Incredible
School Gyrls
Let's go, go
Cheater, cheater, you're a, you're a cheater, you're a cheater (x3)
Cheater, cheater, you're a, you're a, you're a, you're a cheater
You thought that I would just be another one of your toys
You thought I wouldn't find out, but you went and told your boys
Your boys told my girls, and my girls they put me up on game
See the plan that you had ended up being super lame
So you called me last night acting like you were extra sorry
Then you pass me a letter today as soon as you saw me
Saying 'Baby, I know that I did you wrong'
But I promise I'm done, I'm done
But its not that I don't wanna believe you because I do
But every time I try to you give me a reason not to
This is gonna be the easiest song that i have ever sung
All my girls sing along
It goes like

[Chorus]
Ooh, you won't get another love song, you're a cheater
After everything that you've done wrong, you're a cheater
No you won't get another word out of me
You're a che-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cheater
Cheater, cheater, you're a, you're a cheater, you're a cheater (x2)

[Verse 2]
I bet you thought that I wouldn't bounce back, but I did
Not stronger than I was before you ever cheated
Why would I yell, why would I waste a minute on you
When I look this cute (look this cute)
Still I can't check my voicemails without hearing your voice
And you send me messages through every one of your boys
I think you're obsessed with me
This is ridiculous, please
I don't need you in my world
I'm fine chillin' with my girls
And its not that I don't wanna believe you because I do
But every time I try to you give me a reason not to
So incredible, play the song we just knew that it would be the one
All my girls sing along
It goes like

[Chorus]
Ooh, you won't get another love song, you're a cheater
After everything that you've done wrong, you're a cheater
No you won't get another word out of me
You're a che-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cheater
Cheater, cheater, you're a, you're a cheater, you're a cheater (x2)

[Verse 3]
This could have been another love for you
But you went and messed it up, so now we're through
So I'm startin' over, just like I told ya
I'm gonna be fine now that everyone knows, you're a cheater

[Chorus]
Yeah, ooh, you won't get another love song, you're a cheater
After everything that you've done wrong, you're a cheater
No you won't get another word out of me
You're a che-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cheater
Cheater, cheater, you're a, you're a cheater, you're a cheater (x2)---Lyrics submitted by brianna.
