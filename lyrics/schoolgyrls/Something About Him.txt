i dont know the first thing about
love havent really reached that
chapter yet but it's all the little things 
that he does i'm about to fall no safety net

Somebody catch me losin my breath
hes got a little spell worked up on me
Baby i'm fallin Mandy dont call him they
tellin me but theres

Chorus
something bout him i cant lie hes on  my mind
something about him somebody like him is
hard to find hes like the star of my movie he
just does something to me can explain it cant
contain it i dont know what it is theres something about him

Maybe cause he looks so innocent
i just wanna mess him up a bit
they know that im all rapped up in it
even if i tried i couldnt quit everyones
watching gotta use caution people
wanna chat so aimlessly whenever
we're talking im gettin lost in everything
but theres

Chorus

let me tell you quick about him
all these other gyrls say its something
slick about him why? cause his swag
at 100 and climbing and he got me in
this mike booth ryming

chorus(2x)---
