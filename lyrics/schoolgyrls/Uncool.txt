Hey!
Aw yeah!
Uh huh!
Oh yeah!
Everybody wanna be a leader
But they followin' and its okay to be uncool
You wouldn't believe it if I told you everytime I wish that I could stop and press undo
Its not a race I've done before
You run yourself through that door
Just be yourself if you're not sure
Just look inside

[Chorus]
Fall into being you
Its okay to be uncool
And if you are, then you're a star
Just know that everyones not you
And if you dance to a different beat
Its okay cause its all unique
You can be anything you wanna be
Even if thats uncool

[Verse 2]
Its impossible to focus on what you should do
When everybody after you
You build a magic castle
And you hide yourself from battle
So then nobody can shatter you
Find the space you need to breathe
Wear your heart across your sleep
Navigate at your own speed
Just look inside

[Chorus]
Fall into being you
Its okay to be uncool
And if you are, then you're a star
Just know that everyones not you
And if you dance to a different beat
Its okay cause its all unique
You can be anything you wanna be
Even if thats uncool

[Verse 3]
Even if its uncool to dance
So what?
You're just not listenin'
Even if its uncool to dance
So what?
You're still not givin' in
You can be anything you wanna be
Even if thats uncool
Everybody wanna be a leader
But they followin' and its okay to be uncool
You wouldn't believe it if I told you everytime I wish that I could stop and press undo

[Chorus]
Fall into being you
Its okay to be uncool
And if you are, then you're a star
Just know that everyones not you
And if you dance to a different beat
Its okay cause its all unique
You can be anything you wanna be
Even if thats uncool---Lyrics submitted by brianna.
