Little baby in the black cabaret
With your long drawn heels and the the long bird neck
legs a chain link fence and shes always under mine
well at least that's what she cries
haunted by the roses when you look into her eyes
and she likes to tight rope dance she says
alone in the room on a piano string
and her horses may be hungry but they won't eat your hay
we'll teach *****
And if you don't love me just tell me so
I take all my pills from the coffee table
And I run through the streets, I run through the snow
One more smoke before I go
Just give me one more smoke before I go---Lyrics submitted by Zach.
