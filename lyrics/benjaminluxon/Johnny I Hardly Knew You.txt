Along the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo
Along the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo
Along the road to sweet Athy
A stick in me hand and a spot in me eye
I heard a doleful damsel cry,
Johnny I hardly knew ye.
With your guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
With your guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
With your guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy nearly slew ye
and Ye look so queer my darling dear,
Johnny I hardly knew ye.

Where is the eye that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo
Where is the eye that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo
Where is the eye that looked so mild,
That my poor heart you first beguiled
Why did ye skedaddle from me and the child
Johnny, I hardly knew ye
With your guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
With your guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
With your guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy nearly slew ye
and Ye look so queer my darling dear,
Johnny I hardly knew ye.

Where is the leg with which you run, hurroo, hurroo
Where is the leg with which you run, hurroo, hurroo
Where is the leg with which you run,
When first you left to carry a gun
Oh I feel your dancing days are done
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
With your guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
With your guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
With your guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy nearly slew ye
and Ye look so queer my darling dear,
Johnny I hardly knew ye.

Ye haven't an eye, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo
Ye haven't an eye, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo
Ye haven't an eye, ye haven't a leg,
Ye're an eyeless, boneless, chickenless egg
and Ye'll have to put with a bowl out to beg
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.
With your guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
With your guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
With your guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy nearly slew ye
and Ye look so queer my darling dear,
Johnny I hardly knew ye.

Well I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
I'm happy for to see ye home
All from the island of Sulloon
So low in flesh, so high in bone
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye
(They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo
They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo
They're rolling out the guns again
But they never will take our sons again
No, they never will take our sons again
Johnny I'm swearing to ye.)---Lyrics submitted by Harshad Garje.
