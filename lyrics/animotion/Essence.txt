Every man has a hunger
It can overcome the strongest will
Especially if the woman is younger
And she has a tender dream to fill
Youth and beauty have a magic charm
And it's so hard to leave her alone
But like the blazing fire in Medusa's eyes
She can turn a man into stone 

Reaching for the essence in a younger woman's heart
Knowing adolescence is the finest form of art

Back in the days of cavemen
Women learned how to capture power
By taking back what they often gave men
The sweet nectar of a passion flower
The powerful prince that owned your lands
Could determine if you live or die
But he'd get down upon his knees and hands
If the princess would only fly

Reaching for the essence in a younger woman's heart
Knowing adolescence is the finest form of art
Reaching for the essence in a younger woman's heart
Glowing with fluorescence she's a neon candle in the dark

(Long instrumental bridge)

Youth and beauty have a magic charm
And it's so hard to leave her alone
But like the blazing fire in Medusa's eyes
She can turn a man into stone

Reaching for the essence in a younger woman's heart
Knowing adolescence is the finest form of art
Reaching for the essence in a younger woman's heart
Glowing with fluorescence she's a neon candle in the dark
(repeat "in the dark" a few times and fade out)---Lyrics submitted by figoyed.
