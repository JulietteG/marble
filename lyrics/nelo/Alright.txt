Ive seen the eyes of a fading man- he brought it back again
 How come here tears only dry up, when they can wash his hands
And down, down, down theyre rolling down- see her faith divide
And to say shes mistaken- it keeps the time alive

And I Im sorry for tonight

I know the voices of your heart- they spoke of love the same
And echoed their dreams of mine to me, of which were mine to live
And down, down, down, I set you down- I turned the dreams to pain
And you should know I mean to take it all away

And I Im sorry for today

Well, I never shed the skin I know
Id rather watch myself than be exposed 
And since I chose the way that you know, well Im not there, not there
Whoever said that love turns cold when an angry heart is all we know?
If we break the fallen angels hold, then the rest is far from ever told

But Im okay, Im alright tonight
Im okay, Im alright tonight
Well, Im alright

Ive tasted every bit of your world- theres not a sweeter thing
And if my debt runs so dry to you, I see a brighter day
And Im dying for your heart right now to lift me up again
Hold your blessings in my hand for a time

Because I Im sorry for tonight

Well, I never shed the skin I know
Id rather watch myself than be exposed 
And since I chose the way that you know, well Im not there, not there
Whoever said that love turns cold when an angry heart is all we know?
If we break the fallen angels hold, then the rest is far from ever told

But Im okay, Im alright tonight
Im okay, Im alright tonight
Yeah, yeah, Im okay, Im alright tonight
Im okay, Im alright tonight

Yeah, yeah, well Im alright---Lyrics submitted by jay.
