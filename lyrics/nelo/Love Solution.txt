Oh the blessed water
Oh the blessed taste
I can't wait for the world to come to me
Oh the drunk man's daughter
Living in my dreams
I am here with my words and company

Give me life illusion
Give me time confusion
Give me love solution
If the world's stuck on my back, God set me free

I must thank my father
For giving what I need
I've been living in the walls of my dream
So spill the holy water
Spill it over me
I must drink and cleanse my soul of many things

Give me life illusion
Give me time confusion
Give me love solution
If the world's stuck on my back, God set me free

Give me life illusion
Give me time confusion
Give me love solution
If the world's stuck on my back, God set me free
Give me life illusion
Give me time confusion
Give me love solution
If the world's stuck on my back, God set me free
