I dont ask for much, I really feel the cold inside the touch of every single playful story told, Im bold and I know it. 

I came from a place Id like to be at - tasting every day a little bit of sun that sets and sees, oh, everything around it.  

And there is a reflection that I know.  And there is no presence in the gold.  Let the flame burn loud in your soul.  

I woke up today and I felt the faintest little taste of a needed change in my hometown and it sounds like I like it.  I live for the day, in a little bus is where I stay and my message glows like love and wine doin time for the runnin.  

And there is no reflection that I know.  And there is no presence in the gold.  Let the flame burn loud in your soul.

And I listen to all the ones who say Im troubled and say Im broken down.  And I wont listen to all the ones who told me stories, told me I was loud. 

Im about to break on through.  
Im about to break on through.  
And I can feel it, I can feel it, oh.

Rain came today and every drop that fell upon my face was a million people in my mind and I sighed, Im above it.  

High waters high and broken crooked kind of smile, Im living with the sun that shines, Im alive and I love it!  

And there is a reflection that I know.  And there is no presence in the gold.  Let the flame burn loud in your soul. 

Im about to break on through.  
Im about to break on through.  
Im about to break on through  
And I can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it, oh. 

Im about to break on through. 
Im about to break on through. 
Im about to break on through.  

Yeah! Oh.---Lyrics submitted by John.
