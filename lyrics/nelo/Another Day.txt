Hey man, you heard a tune
You say your heart was racing
Today I see the truth, and I dont know what, and I dont know why
Tempting to hold on to such kisses dropped down on me
Im going to follow through what Im tasting, what Im making, yeah

And I say another day is all I need to come my way
(Im) breathing in new light to keep my world a sacrifice
You see no differently to watch the best come over me
And keep my ageless eyes awake

Well, its something to miss my friend-
If you say that youre not needing
Why dont you look again, well youll see the door, its slowly closing
Its easy to wash away, yeah, when your world seems overflowing
Might as well just walk away
Well, some day look the other way

And I say another day is all I need to come my way
(Im) breathing in new light to keep my world a sacrifice
And you see no differently to watch the best come over me
So, keep my ageless eyes awake

But when were falling and the worlds crashing down, look inside for life
And when all is breaking and your hearts aching, believe- there comes a time
When you know your waiting to play the odds, to share your light
When you know your blessing was dreamed to fly, to wake our eyes
Theres no difference, and Im not wasting time for life, yeah

Well, Ive seen the darkest day
And I swear the sky was falling
Leave it to fall away, when the best, of course, the best is coming
A sweetness so riveting, when I know my blood is flowing
The lightest touch of life to give me, to lift me up

And I say another day is all I need to come my way
(Im) breathing in new light to keep my world a sacrifice
You see no differently to watch the best come over me
And keep my ageless eyes,
Keep my ageless eyes awake---Lyrics submitted by jay.
