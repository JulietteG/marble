Wake up to the problem from another point of view
I got one thing left, and I got something left to do
And so I, I wont stop until you get up, when youre laying next to me
Because my whole worlds in front of me in your simple little tease

And I say:
I say its okay, youre my little baby
(Were) climbing up on our way
(Im) hoping youll find the time
And I know were not the same, (but) you could really save me
No way Im slipping away- (It) feels too alive this time

It seems hard to forget things, we were playing in the streets
You know I cant do much for you when youre curling next to me 
And so I, I know what youre tasting from the kisses on my cheek
Why dont you turn around for me now (and) feel a second breeze?

And I say:
I say its okay, youre my little baby
(Were) climbing up on our way
(Im) hoping youll find the time
And I know were not the same, (but) you could really save me
No way Im slipping away- (It) feels too alive this time

Youre all I need to spin me round when I need to satisfy you
Youre the waves above my head and the surfaces inside me
We could light a candle here, my love- Im in love with your enticement
You complete the love in me, in this place I recognize in time

So on wed never get caught- we were running in the wind
Its no funny thing now to just spin around again
And so I, Ill hold on to the feeling comes spilling out of you
And take it out of here now- Take it to the other room

And I say:
I say its okay, youre my little baby
(Were) climbing up on our way
(Im) hoping youll find the time
And I know were not the same, (but) you could really save me
No way Im slipping away- (It) feels too alive this time

And I say:
I say its okay, youre my little baby
(Were) climbing up on our way
(Im) hoping youll find the time
And I know were not the same, (but) you could really save me
No way Im slipping away- Im taking it all in stride---Lyrics submitted by jay.
