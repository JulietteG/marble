Wake me, wake me up if you want to live
And keep me on top of love- I still believe that
I need more than a little something here
Why keep it down?  It brings me up again

And I want to fall in love
And I dont want to give it up

I have an eye to a mind that says
I need to feel me need again
Oh, Ive got a lot to say tonight
I want to breath on the inside
To make a claim I made you strong
You should know theres nothing wrong
Ive become accustomed to help me stand again

See me, your worried eyes awake to me
And Ill be undone to all my waiting
And youll see the strongest love burns deep in me
And I wont burn out- No, my heart will bleed again

And I want to fall in love
And I dont want to give it up
And I want to fall in love
And I dont want to give it up

I have an eye to a mind that says
I need to feel me need again
Oh, Ive got a lot to say tonight
I want to breath on the inside
To make a claim I made you strong
You should know theres nothing wrong
I have a thought to make my way
We can push this all away because

I see your broken love
And I know my life, I know Im right
Were gonna shake this thing tonight
Because Ill bleed you love, and Ill give you life
Because Ive seen your heart in a tainted light ---Lyrics submitted by jay.
