Hey, boy come and save it up
You dance for a girl
You stop and turn your world around
You watch the faces go
You bring in the missing ones
Your heart feels like the sun
You see the flowers in your hand
You stop and let it go

I walked today- it was just the same
Because I remember everything
When the words were spoken at my feet,
They seemed to say: Lets get back to our roots

Rain come, come and wash me out
I sit and think of her
 My sun is burning out my eyes
So I bathe in the snow
She comes to me at night
I see her in the hall
I walk closer, closer to the light
I reach but she is gone

I walked today- it was just the same
Because I remember everything
And when the words were spoken at my feet,
They seemed to say: Lets get back to our roots

Yeah, oh lets get back to our roots

Angel, you guide my hand- Im opening up my eyes to feel you 
I know that I can see this girl
You swim in my soul when I am sleeping
You are my love, my love Im dreaming, yeah, yeah
Oh, you know Im waiting, yeah, yeah
Oh, you know Im waiting

Well, I know the patience surely goes
I guess that you must know
I see the perfect kind of light
And Ill sit and watch it glow
Well, I know the seasons change,
But I dream through them all
Well, Ill sit and think about my light
And Ill wait for the call

I walked today- it was just the same
Because I remember everything
Well, I dont know what youve been told 
But I must say: Lets get back to our roots!
Yeah, lets get back to our roots---Lyrics submitted by jay.
