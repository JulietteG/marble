I know where the rain doesnt play
And I know where the shadows roll away
And I know where the spaces divide
And I go to the sunny place sometimes
Its something to realize,
Something to replace your time
And I know where the rain doesnt play
And Ill go where the shadows roll away

And I guess that my fortunes within
And I guess that the running makes me thin
And I say that its for you to take
And I say that its all that I can make
Its something that the people say,
Something that will make you stay
And I know where the rain doesnt play
And Ill go where the shadows roll away

Im breathing
And Im feeling

Well, I know how to make your day
And I know how to take it all away
And Ive seen these things all around
And I hear when they make their sound, sound, sounds
So I bring a little more to see,
Another thing to fill me
And I know where the rain doesnt play 
And Im looking at a sunny day

Im breathing
And Im feeling

Morning is coming out
The sun is dancing wildly in and out
Oh, and morning, yeah it takes the pain
Oh, and I am swimming in a love of nothing
Yeah, nothing

So I sit with my mind in the air
And I think of a place thats oh-so fair
And I sing of the perfect town
And I smile when she moves her feet around
An open hand, a jumping bean
A little curl, youll all be smiling at me
And I know where the rain doesnt play
And Ill go where the shadows roll away

Morning is coming out
Oh yeah, the sun is dancing wildly in and out
Oh, and morning, yeah it takes the pain
Oh yeah, and I am swimming in a love of nothing
Yeah, nothing
Oh, nothing
Oh, yeah---Lyrics submitted by jay.
