Driving south on Highway 1 with the top down and the setting sun
You've got that blue bandana on
This'll Be a Memory
Singing along with the radio at the top of your lungs to "Billy Joel"
Making up the words that you don't know
This'll Be a Memory.

This'll be a broken blanket on a cold, cold night
Flatting me up and holding me tight
A moment I keep in the back of my mind that never fades away
This'll be the truth I need that love exists
And one more thing I'm gonna miss when the years find me whispering your name.
Ooo, ooo, ooo, This'll Be a Memory.

Soft moonlight falling on your face
Don't know how to tell you I just can't stay
So I let you sleep as I walk away
This'll Be a Memory.
Maybe I'm running, maybe I'm not but I'm loosing this battle I've always fought
And by the time I figure out what I've lost
This'll Be a Memory.

This'll be a broken blanket on a cold, cold night
Flatting me up and holding me tight
A moment I keep in the back of my mind that never fades away
This'll be the truth I need that love exists
And one more thing I'm gonna miss when the years find me whispering your name.
Ooo, ooo, ooo, This'll Be a Memory.

This'll be the truth I need that love exists 
And one more thing I'm gonna miss when the years find me whispering your name.
Ooo, ooo, ooo, This'll Be a Memory

Come morning it'll be hard to see
But you'll find a love I couldn't be
And there won't be any tears when you think of me
This'll Be a Memory
This'll Be a Memory.---Lyrics submitted by Lizzie.
