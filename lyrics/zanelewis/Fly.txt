Some people think I'm crazy,
A little loud,
A little lazy.
Well, I don't know.

I always did things my way.
Just living for today,
Everywhere I go.

Home is anywhere that I lay my head down.
My feet are never planted on the ground.

I'm gonna Fly!
Always headed down some highway!
Some lost highway.
Good-bye is something I find hard to say,
As I fade away.
This old gypsy soul is all I've ever known.
Baby, I'll see you somewhere down the road.
But I'm gonna Fly!
Yeah! I'm gonna Fly!

I'll always love you, baby,
But this is how the good Lord made me.
So don't hold on tight.

You know I'm gonna miss you,
So come here and let me kiss you,
Just one more time.

Tomorrow begins another day.
I know you'll be alright.
So let me wipe that tear from your eye,
Before I Fly!

I'll be headed down some highway!
Some lost highway.
Good-bye is something I find hard to say,
As i fade away.
This old gypsy soul is all I've ever known.
Baby, I'll see you somewhere down the road.
But I'm gonna Fly!
Yeah! I'm gonna Fly!

This old gypsy soul is all I've ever known.
Baby, I'll see you somewhere down the road.
But I'm gonna Fly!
I'm gonna Fly.
I'm gonna Fly.
Ouh! I'll miss you, baby!
Ouh!
Fly!
Ouh!---Lyrics submitted by Skye.
