Hear a song, you sing along.
The words you identify,
like you don't feel so alone, tonight.

(Chorus)
And rest your soul now,
cause music saves your life.
Rest your soul now,
cause music save your life.

(piano)

Lay your head, down in bed.
And the tune it spins on and on.
As you drift, drift along, so long, so long.

(chorus)

(guitar)

(chorus)

Hear a song.---Lyrics submitted by karli.
