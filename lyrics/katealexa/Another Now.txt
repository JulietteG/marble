!st STANZA

Was only just the other day,
When all this felt so real,
Like nothing could go wrong.
Was like a never ending dream,
Nothing ever changed,
For so long.

But now you've, gone away
and i tried, turning the page
And its just, not the same

CHORUS

But I'm breathing in,
And I'm breathing out,
I'm wide awake,
but i can't hear a sound

Though I'm breathing in,
I can't think about,
another you, another me, another now.

2nd STANZA

Where do I go from here,
I've never felt so strange,
I've never felt so torn,
Cause ever since you came my way,
I learned to live by you,
And now I'm on my own,

I know I need some time,
To leave all this behind,
Cause I'm still hanging on, 

CHORUS

But I'm breathing in,
And I'm breathing out,
I'm wide awake,
but i can't hear a sound

Though I'm breathing in,
I can't think about,
another you, another me, another now.

BRIDGE

Sitting here, all alone,
Don't wanna move, nowhere to go,
Nothing's real, just wanna hide, 

Cause your not here 

CHORUS

But I'm breathing in,
And I'm breathing out,
I'm wide awake,
but i can't hear a sound

Though I'm breathing in,
I can't think about,

Another you, another me, another now---Lyrics submitted by Arvian Cunan.
