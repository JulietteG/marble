Now everything inside my lifes become a mystery
And all the things that Ive held dear have lost reality
I cannot go I do not know if you are really here
Just let me know

I need a friend to depend on
I need so much more
Another reason to live my life is knocking on my door

I need to know if I can go
All the way down and back again
I need to know if I can take another leap of faith today

Someone tell me so I can figure it out
Somethings wrong nothings right 
My life is filled with doubt
Lost the only really thing Ive ever known
Lost it all and now my hope is gone---Lyrics submitted by jennifer.
