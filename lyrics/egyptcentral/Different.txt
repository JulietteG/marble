Used to live my life for you
Until my soul got tired
Did all I was supposed to do
I could fool a liar

(Pre-chorus)
Threw it all away
Through it all to find redemption
Gave it all away
Gave it all to who would listen

(Chorus)
Thats the price I paid
For being different
And I walk this road alone
Thats the price I paid
For being different
I can call this life my own

Used to be a part of you
Until that part was taken
I used to see your point of view
Until my faith was shaken

Running in the sun to seek what Ill find
Crossing your path that intersects mine
Trapped in a scene that only seems real
Confronted by dreams that I can now feel
My fronts have all failed and been stripped away
We all look the same at the end of the day
Given up once Ill take it back twice
Will it ever cease this is my flight 

Slow me down to breathe
Never will I break this fate could not faze me
Never could I shake the things that you gave me

My heart does not see
Concrete burns and skies will come down
But nothing can take the focus Ive found---Lyrics submitted by jennifer.
