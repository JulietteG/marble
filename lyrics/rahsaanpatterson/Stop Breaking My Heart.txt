Why do u keep
Stressin' me I'm 
Not into those
Kinds of things
Like arguing, and fighting
I'm all about loving, yes loving So...Chorus:
Stop breaking my heart baby 
It's not supposed to be that way (yeah)
Cuz I know that you love me
At times it's hard to see
Why you break my heart baby

Often I sit
Wondering why 
Love hurts and
Makes u cry
It's not easy, or should be
It's all about loving, yes loving So....

chorus

- guitar... -

Don't take this the wrong way
Baby I love you - will always
If we want this to last - we gotta make changes fast
Cuz livin' with a broken heart {is all far too bad?}
