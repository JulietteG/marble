You wouldn't know me depression kicks in, when panic's attacking and I miss medicine
When my neck can't hold up my head and I just can't get out of bed
When you see me uncomfortably chain smoking, trying to force up a smile
Then I'm slippin' (slippin') again

And I don't wanna drag no one down with my problem
That's in my head
I'll probably snap out but I just don't know when

Apologies from me
This is nothing that I want you to see
Trying to drown out that ringing voice
Mike, give it up, give it up
Like a pick in a hollow body
Give it up, give it up, give it up down
Into the sea, tentacles got me by the neck and they're pulling me down

I try to keep in check
Stay on top, teeter tot won't balance I guess
Every time I get one under control the rest start rising and then
I stay shut up in my home
Agoraphobic and alone
'Til with bit lip, fuck it, I gotta try
Hands clenching, sweating,
Don't want no one to see in my mind
It's not a pretty sight
The right half don't work and the screws aren't tight

Apologies from me
This is nothing that I want you to see
Trying to drown out that ringing voice
Mike, give it up, give it up
Like a pick in a hollow body
Give it up, give it up, give it up down
Into the sea, tentacles got me by the neck and they're pulling me do---Lyrics submitted by kevin.
