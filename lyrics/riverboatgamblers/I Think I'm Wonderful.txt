Maybe It's cos' of the way that I dress
They say I look out of place
And my taste is a mess
And there ain't
No point in trying
Cos' I know what they're dying to do
Some stupid opinions
on the way that I am
They can look at me
and I don't give a damn, damn, damn
They got no sense of humour
They only spread the rumour
They say I'm just misguided
I don't agree

I think I'm wonderful
I think I'm wonderful 

Sometimes I have a couple, over the eight
When I go over the top
Get in a hell of a state
And there ain't
No point in trying
Cos' I know what they're dying to do
Stick them, their feelings, what a way to behave
You say I'm crazy but you can't look away
It's just a noise they're making
Whose got the time to take it?
They think I'm nothing special
I don't agree

I think I'm wonderful
I think I'm wonderful
I think I'm wonderful
I think I'm wonderful 

The one mistreated
I won't be beaten
I can't be beaten now
And I'm mistrusted
I won't be busted
They call me bastard yeah

I think I'm wonderful
I think I'm wonderful
I think I'm wonderful
I think I'm wonderful 

Hey! hey! hey!........---Lyrics submitted by Zsi.
