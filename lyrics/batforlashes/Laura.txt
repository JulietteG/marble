You say, that theyve all left you behind
Your heart broken, the party died

Drape your arms around me and softly say
Can we dance upon the tables again?
When your smile is so wide and
your heels are so high
You cant cry, get your glad rags on
And lets sing along
To that lonely song
youre the train that crashed my heart
Youre the glitter in the dark
Uh, Laura youre more than a superstar
And in this horror show
Ive got to tell you so
Uh Laura youre more than a superstar
Say that youre stuck in a pale blue dream
And your tears feel hot on my bed sheets
Drape your arms around me and softly say
Can we dance upon the tables again?
When your smile is so wide
Your heels are so high
You cant cry but youre glad
rags on and lets sing along
To that lonely song
Youre the train that crashed my heart
Youre the glitter in the dark

Uh, Laura youre more than a superstar
Youll be famous for longer then them
Your name is tattooed on every boys skin
Uh, Laura youre more than a superstar
youre the train that crashed my heart
Youre the glitter in the dark
Uh, Laura youre more than a suerstar
And in this old horror show
Ive got to let you know
Uh Laura youre more than a superstar---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
