Sometimes, I get to thinkin' I've been aiming too high
Could be that I know what happens when I lower my sides
Looks for the moment no longer appeals
I wanna know how it feels to be

Wanted for just what I am
Not one single ulterior motive in mind
Just wanted
Completely unselfishly 100 percent all the time

There's one I know when I see 'em
And there was a time
I'd be makin' his kind of trouble
Temporarily mine

I guess my heart's growin' up
All that he wants is to loved and be

Wanted for just what I am
Not one single ulterior motive in mind
Just wanted
Completely unselfishly 100 percent all the time

I won't stop, till I get it emendated
It seems like a lot but it's not, I just wanna be

Wanted for just what I am
Not one single ulterior motive in mind
Just wanted
Completely unselfishly 100 percent all the time

Wanted, just wanted
I wanna be wanted---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
