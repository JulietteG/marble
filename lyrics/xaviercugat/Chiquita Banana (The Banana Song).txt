I'm Chiquita banana and I've come to say 
Bananas have to ripen in a certain way
When they are fleck'd with brown and have a golden hue Bananas taste the best and are best for you 
You can put them in a salad 
You can put them in a pie-aye 
Any way you want to eat them 
It's impossible to beat them 
But, bananas like the climate of the very, very tropical equator 
So you should never put bananas in the refrigerator---Lyrics submitted by Marie.
