You may land in the water next to the bridge
Which is instant death, but that's okay
You may land in the water next to the bridge
Which is instant death, but that's okay

Cobra matte, cobra matte

It's okay if you fall off the platform
I've died quite a few times trying to do this
It's okay if you fall off the platform
I've died a few times trying to do this

Cobra matte, cobra matte

You can just jump off and miss everything
If you're trying to do it faster
You can just jump off and miss everything
If you're trying to do it faster

Cobra matte, cobra matte

Go back to the area with the bridge but don't cross it
Go back to the area with the bridge but don't cross it
Instead go right and go through the gates

Matte, matte
Cobra matte, cobra matte
Cobra matte, cobra matte ---Lyrics submitted by Derek Wilson.
