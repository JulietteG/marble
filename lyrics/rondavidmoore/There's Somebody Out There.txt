There's somebody out there hurt and confused
An innocent child being abused
There's somebody out there whose heart is
Breaking in two
There's somebody out there feeling alone
A husband, a wife being done wrong
There's somebody out there shattered from
A broken home

[Chorus:]
But there's Somebody out there with arms open wide
Who longs to embrace you, dry the tears from your eyes
He's hope for the hopeless
He'll carry the burdens you bear
When you don't have a prayer
There's Somebody out there

There's somebody out there who thought it was cool
To keep taking chances thinking they'd never lose
Now they're hooked on a feeling that's
Left them empty and fooled
There's somebody out there who can't quite decide
Whether to live or whether to die
They're searching for strength to get
Through their crisis in life---Lyrics submitted by Karleigh.
