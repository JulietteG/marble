I've heard it called by different names
All over the world, but it's all the same
Now there's so many ways to make love
A million ways I been thinking of, oh yeah

But there's only one way
There's only one way to rock, yeah

So many things can get you high
I'm gonna try 'em all just once before I die
And you can analyze this situation
To me it's all just mental masturbation, huh

There's only one way
There's only one way to rock
There's only one way
There's only one way to rock, ow

Now quickly, check the hands on the clock
It's 8:05, it's time to rock

And this world can disagree
They don't understand how it can be
And it's not my point of view
It's a fact and you know that it's true, huh, oh yeah

There's only one way
There's only one way to rock
There's only one way
There's only one way to rock, yeah

Crank up the drums, crank out the bass
Crank up my in your face, yeah

There's only one way
There's only one way to rock
There's only one way
There's only one way to rock
There's only one way
There's only one way to rock

There's only one way
There's only one way
There's only one way to rock
Yeah, to rock
To rock, ow
One way to rock, ah, huh---
