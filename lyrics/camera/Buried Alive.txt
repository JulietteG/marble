Hello, my love, Hello
Hello, my love, Hello

Hello, my love, I know
We are all here alone
If you could see
what's meant to be
We are all here alone, alone, alone
Let Go!

She was buried there alive
For everyone to see
No glory in her life
Cause she was meant to be

When you make big plans,
when you make big plans,
when you make big plans with me.
When you make big plans,
when you make big plans,
when you make big plans you'll see.

Woah oh oh oh! Woah!  
Woah oh oh oh! Woah!  
Woah oh oh oh! Oh No!

She was buried there alive
For everyone to see
No glory in her life
Cause she was meant to be

In the colors that surround
And those that will never be
No glory in her life
No glory in her life

When you make big plans,
when you make big plans,
when you make big plans with me.
When you make big plans,
when you make big plans,
when you make big plans you'll see.

Woah oh oh oh! Woah!  
Woah oh oh oh! Woah!  
Woah oh oh oh! Woah!  
Woah oh oh oh! Oh No!---Lyrics submitted by Brian McGraw.
