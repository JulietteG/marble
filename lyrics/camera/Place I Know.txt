Take me to a place I know.
Where everything is far away.
The walls in here are following me.
So take me to a place I know.

And as we stand in line.
Soldiers march all of the time.
And I know that's it's just us.
We're now two of a kind.
I never would change your mind.
cause I know that it's all right.

Take me to a place I know.
Where I can rest my head and lay.
The floors in here are swallowing me.
So take me to a place I know.

And as we stand in line.
Soldiers march all of the time.
And I know that's it's just us.
We're now two of a kind.
I never would change your mind.
cause I know that it's all right.---Lyrics submitted by Brian McGraw.
