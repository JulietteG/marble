Are we ever getting out of here?
I just wanna be anywhere tonight.
Will we ever be free from fear?
Why are things so unclear?

I don't wanna be caged by fear
Can't you tell me if I'll ever be alright?
I just wanna be far from here.
Why are things so unfair?

Am I ever getting out of here?
I just wanna be anywhere tonight.
Will we ever be free from fear?
Without ever going nuclear.---Lyrics submitted by Brian McGraw.
