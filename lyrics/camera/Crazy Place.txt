It's the most beautiful thing I think Ive ever seen
A homeless child playing with something as simple as a cardboard box and he seems so happy
with that smile on his face like nothing matters hes so serene
when he doesnt even know if hes gonna live through another day worrying about what hes gonna eat

when I look at that it kinda makes me feel guilty
cause the world that Im living in only seems to care about having enough money
to buy luxurious things that we dont even need
I'm not trying to be the good girl to save the world cause I do the same damn thing


(Chorus)
isn't it a shame, but we only have ourselves to blame
but love is the most beautiful thing
but its a lost somewhere along the way to money and fame ( to money and fame)
Isnt the world a crazy place

we were all brought up with different dreams and beliefs
but the one thing we all need is to be loved by friends and family
and when a child like that with no parents around is able to smile makes me feel very weak, small, and vulnerable

when I look at that it kinda makes me feel guilty cause the world that Im living in only seems to care about having enough money, to buy luxurious things that we dont even need
I'm not trying to be the good girl to save the world cause I do the same damn thing


(chorus)
isn't it a shame, but we only have ourselves to blame
but love is the most beautiful thing
but its a lost somewhere along the way to money and fame (to money and fame)
isnt the world a crazy place

it makes me conscious of all of the things I have and makes me feel oh so fast
it makes me want to follow my dreams
and tries to be a better person
it takes me to a higher level
it makes me wipe away all a my tears
it helps me put a smile on my face
cause everything I need is right here

isn't it a shame, but we only have ourselves to blame
but love is the most beautiful thing
but its a lost somewhere along the way to money and fame ( to money and fame),

isn't it a shame, but we only have ourselves to blame
but love is the most beautiful thing
but its a lost somewhere along the way to money and fame
isnt the world a crazy place ( isnt the world, .. isnt the world..)---Lyrics submitted by anna.
