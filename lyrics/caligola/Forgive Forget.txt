Dreaming about the good old times
You need to forgive forget
You need to forgive forget

Dreaming about the good old times
You need to forgive forget
You need to forgive forget

I was working in the kitchen
Try to earn my lovely hood
Mama told me be a good boy
Mama, Im sorry, but I couldn't
I was drowning in temptations
I'm a sinner to the bone
(Thought) I was flowing on the surface
I was sinking like a stone
I dont need your lie
I dont need your help
I just need myself and my gun in my hand

Dreaming about the good old times
You need to forgive forget
You need to forgive forget

Dreaming about the good old times
You need to forgive forget
You need to forgive forget

Oh believe me when I tell you
That life ain't but a sin
Too many walls without
Too many walls within
So walk with me through the valley of (hope)
Don't forget your love
Don't forget your soul
You dont need your parents
You dont need my help
You just need yourself and a god in your head

Dreaming about the good old times
You need to forgive forget
You need to forgive forget

Dreaming about the good old times
You need to forgive forget
You need to forgive forget---
