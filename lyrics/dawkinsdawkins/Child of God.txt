Rap: 

Tick tock can't you hear the clock 
So what cha wanna do 
Time to rock and roll 
Get cha Bible 
Cause if He locked the door, 
Gotta drop and roll, 
With flocks that go the wrong way 
Heart cold, don't slip and you betta be bout 
When the trumpet's sounded 
You might be grounded 

Verse: 

It concerns me when you do what you wanna do 
Ignoring the voice of the Father 
It's time for you to jump on the wagon 
And stop all your slackin', 
Cause you're a child of God and He loves you! 

Hook: 

You're a child of God no matter who you are 
Come as you are, find your ladder to the stars 
Child of God, trust and He'll understand 
Cause you don't wanna miss your chance 
To dance in the promised land 

Verse: 

Tomorrow is a day that you don't control, 
So you don't know what entails the future, oh 
Jump in the race, there's no need to hate 
Ensure your fate 
Cause you're a child of God and He loves you! 

(Repeat Hook 2X) Rap: 

I done told you before 
For the P.A.J.A.M. has no time for show 
Go for what we know 
So why you worried about us, 
Thinkin' that we caught up 
But you're right He's like a magnet 
He's pullin' us up 
Now put your mind to work, 
Cause if we grind the dirt 
Without the Lord, meet the fireworks 
1 ain't talkin' bout July the 4th 
You'll be shakin ' hands with the fool Lucifer 

(Repeat Hook/Vamp)
