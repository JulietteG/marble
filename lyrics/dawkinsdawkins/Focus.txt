Hook: 
I can see clearly now, walking in the light nothing can stop me now, I got my focus right, Moving to higher ground, I see my future bright, Nothing can hold me down, I got my focus 

Verse: 
After all this time I finally see the truth, Since I fixed You in my gaze, 
Got my mind made up, affections set on You ,I'll let nothing ever separate 

(Repeat Hook)

Verse: 
Vision sometimes seems a little less than clear, Can't see my hand before my face, 
Lord You know all things, that's why I keep You near, 
Guide me when I lose my way

(Repeat Hook)

Bridge: 
I keep thinking about Your love, Thinking about Your grace, 
How You opened up my eyes to see a brighter day, Life is renewed, past is erased, 
It all came together when I looked at things Your way 

All Instruments: Fred Jerkins III
