Verse: 

May be in the middle of a desert, 118 fahrenheit
As long as You're by my side 
May be on a raging sea, 
Waves crashing down on me, 
Long as You're with me 1 know I'll survive 

Channel: 

Because it's in You I live 
And it's in You I breathe 
And it's in You I move and I have my being 

Hook:

I'd rather be with You, just for a moment or two 
I'd rather be with You, follow You anywhere 

Verse:

May not be a superstar,
May not drive no fancy car 
But I know You'll supply my needs 
May not go 'round the world 
May not have diamonds and pearls,
But it really don't matter to me 

(Repeat Channel)
(Repeat Hook)
