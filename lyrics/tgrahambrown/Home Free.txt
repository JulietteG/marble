I have been all around the world
Just to see what I could see
And everywhere around every turn
Are people living life differently
I have stood on the wall of China
Sailed around the African horn
But every night when I lay me down
I thank God Im American born
And

Chorus:
I am home free Living in the land of opportunity
Just give me that old time liberty I am home free

Verse 2:
This land is a pot of gold
With a written guarantee
You can go where you wanna go
You can be who you wanna be
And its giving you one condition
That you promise to pass it on
Yeah, every night when I lay me down
I thank God Im American born

Chorus refrain 

Verse 3:
Keep that freedom torch burning
For the whole world to see the light
Let me live under Old Glory
Till the day that I die

Chorus refrain x2

I am home free
Yeah, I am home free---Lyrics submitted by Elisha R. Henry.
