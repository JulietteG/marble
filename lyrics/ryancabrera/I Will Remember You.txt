Eight years later 
Time goes by fast 
Got my memories 
And they will last 
I try to keep it simple 
Cause I hate goodbyes 
I try to keep it simple 
By telling myself 

That 
I, I will remember you 
And all of the things that we've gone through 
There is so much I could say 
But words get in the way 
So, if we're not together 
I will remember you 
I will remember you 

We're a picture 
In my mind 
And when I want to find you 
I just close my eyes 
You'll never be that far from me 
So don't say goodbye 
Cause you'll never be that far from me 
I'm telling myself 

That 
I, I will remember you 
And all of the things that we've gone through 
There is so much I could say 
But words get in the way 
So, if we're not together 
I will remember you 

You were there when 
I needed a friend 
Thank you, thank you 
I never told you 
How much that meant 
Yeah thank you, thank you 

I will remember you 
And all of the things that we've gone through 
There is so much I could say 
But words get in the way 

So, I.. I will remember you 
And all of the things that we've gone through 
There is so much I could say 
But words get in the way 
So, when we're not together 
I will remember 
When we're not together 
I will remember you 

I will remember you---Lyrics submitted by Chantel.
