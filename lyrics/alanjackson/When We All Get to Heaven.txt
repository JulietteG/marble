Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace:
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He'll prepare us a place.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will overspread the sky:
But when travling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving everyday;
Just one glimpse of him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold; 
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold.

When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.---Lyrics submitted by Julie.
