This old bar stool is feeling high
As I started sinking low
The minute she waltzed right through that door

Not long ago I held her
Like a fool I went and left her
Now she's with somebody new out on that floor

And she's got the rhythm 
And I've got the blues
And she's showing me how much I had to lose

With her every little move
She's telling me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm
And I've got the blues

Well that musics getting louder
As my hearts keeps beating faster
And she spells out regret in perfect time

Well I thought I wanted freedom
But that ball and chain I need
When you choose sometimes you lose the prize

Cause she's got the rhythm
And I've got the blues
And she's showing me how much I had to lose

With her every little move
She's telling me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm
And I've got the blues

Yeah, with her every little move
She's telling me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm
And I've got the blues---Lyrics submitted by T J Autry.
