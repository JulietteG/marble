Hey you were standing by the screen door slamming
Rather clear whats taking place.
You were holding on to Louie
He was packing, he was heavy that plastic handle just about to break

Well then you picked up Chloe.
She knew yall were going
She started barking like a tank.
I was shocked and I was joking,
But I would not be longing.
Cause I got Jim and Jack and Hank

Take your string bikinis, your apple martinis
Take whats left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me youre just a total blank,
go on and leave me baby
I dont need you, I got
Jim and Jack and Hank

Well now you left screaming and your tires screeching
That little dog right in your lap
I have become a little sad and I called up my old dad
He said son you just woke me from my nap
I told him you had left me.
He said now son dont you hate me
You know exactly what I think.
You know youre better off
You can fish and you can golf.
You still got Jim and Jack and Hank

Take your string bikinis, your apple martinis
Take whats left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me youre just a total blank,
go on and leave me baby
I dont need you, I got
Jim and Jack and Hank

Thats right

So I got out the whiskey I began to listen to songs out in my truck you couldnt crank
I started feeling empty, then again it hit me. I got Jim and Jack and Hank

Take your string bikinis, your apple martinis
Take whats left there in the bank
Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me youre just a total blank,
go on and leave me baby
I dont need you, I got
Jim and Jack and Hank
Yeh now go on and leave me baby
I dont need you
I got Jim and Jack and Hank

Thats right, you go ahead, Ill be a okay
Cause I got Jose, Captain Morgan
Not to mention Old George and Tammy, Loretta, Merell, Willie Nelson, Big John Cash
How about Old Jimmy Buffet bring him in there when its sun shining,
George Strait an old friend
Cant forget Hank Jr and all his rowdy friends
Im gonna clean out the whole closet, baby
All yeah... Goodbye---
