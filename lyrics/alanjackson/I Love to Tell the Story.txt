I love to tell the story of unseen things above of Jesus and his glory 

of Jesus and his love I love to tell the story because I know it's true

It's satisfies my loneliness as nothing else can do I love to tell the story

to be my name in glory to tell the old old story of Jesus and his love

I love to tell the story for those who know it best same hungering and

thirsting to hear it like the rest and when it seems a glory I sing a new new

song twil' be the old old story that I have loved so long I love to tell the 

story twil' be my name in glory to tell the old old story of Jesus and his love

to tell the old old story of Jesus and his love.---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.
