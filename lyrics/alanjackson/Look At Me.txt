I would bet my life like I bet my heart
That you were the one baby
I've never been so sure of anything before
It's driving my heart crazy, I can't hold out
I can't hold back now like I've done before

Darlin' look at me, I've fallen like a fool for you
And darlin' can't you see I'd do anything you want me to?
I tell myself I'm in too deep
Then I fall a little farther every time you look at me

How do you do that girl?
Make me feel like I'm the only man alive for you
I guess that's what it is that makes me fall like this
The first time in your arms I knew
The way you held me, it overwhelmed me
I went out of my mind

Darlin' look at me, I've fallen like a fool for you
And darlin' can't you see I'd do anything you want me to?
I tell myself I'm in too deep
Then I fall a little farther every time you look at me

Every time baby
Every time you look at me---
