Oh soul, are you weary and troubled? 
No light in the darkness you see?
There's a light for a look at the Savior,
And life more abundant and free
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace
Through death into life everlasting
He passed and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conquerors we are
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely and dim
In the light of his glory and grace
His Work shall not fail you---He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well:
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in his wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim 
In the light of His glory and grace
And the things of earth will grown strangely dim
In the light of His glory and praise.

                                           "We must keep our eyes on Jesus, 
                                    who leads us and makes our faith complete..."
