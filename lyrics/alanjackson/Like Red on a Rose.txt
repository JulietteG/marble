Like red on a rose
when your lips first smiled at me
i was captured instantly
to each his own

like blue in the sky
the gaze of your willing eyes
touched something deep inside
let truth be known
that i love you like only 
little children love pennies
and i love you cause i know i 
cant do anything wrong
your where i belong
like red on a rose

and i love you like only 
little children love pennies
and i love you like good times
of which ive known many
and i love you cause i know you
give me a heart of my own
you make my blood flow
like red on a rose---Lyrics submitted by samantha.
