So incredible

So incredible baby

[Dustin:]
Baby you're so fly (fly)
Got me tryna figure out 
How I can be your guy
Cause I
Saw you from across the room
I'm like "Oh My God"
She's fine
Lookin at you all grown up
Them jeans fit you right
So could I
If you let me baby

[Bryan:]
The way you walk around
Act like you own the town
Knownin this my town
Go head girl put me down
Baby you're just my type
I gotta make you mine
Show you what loves feels like

[B5:]
You're so incdredible
Babygirl I can't explain
I just wanna know your name
Let me see your face again
You're so incredible
Girl your body's off the chain
Can't let you get away
Girl I need you here with me
You're so incredible

[Patrick:]
Baby I'm confused
You sayin you got a man
But he ain't here with you
Not cool
How can he make other plans
He don't deserve you
But it's cool
Cause Imma be the one 
To show you, show you what to do
If you let me baby

[Bryan:]
The way you walk around

And I just can't see why you were here by yourself
