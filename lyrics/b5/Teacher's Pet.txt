can i be your teacher's pet?

it was just another monday.
i can't wait for this day to end yeah.
i was walkin down the hallway.
to class but as i walked in.
that's when i saw this girl so beautiful.
from her head to cuticles.
but what i didn't know was.
see this girl that had me out of breath.
was a substitute i guess.
cause she told me take my test.

[HOOK:]
(there goes my heart.)
there goes my heart.
(i guess we were meant to be apart.)
i guess it wasn't meant to be.
(sure that morning star.) 
give her a love she can't forget if i could be her teacher's pet .

[Chorus:]
(if i could only one chance.)
to show you that i understand what it takes to be a man.
(so baby please come take my hand.)
we can keep it on the low.
girl nobody has to know.
(if i could only be with you.)
anything you wanna do.
i'm not afraid to try with you.
(i may be young but you can bet.)
you can give me any test if i could be your teacher's pet.

as she was writing on the chalkboard.
what i saw made a playa's eye sore.
i know.
there's no way i could, shake this.
can't take this.
caught off in the matrix.
oh, no.
(the way her dress fits.)
firmly on her waist.
made that coca-cola shape .
made me wanna get a taste and.
soon as the bell rang .
i know i gotta let you know.
i just can't let you go.
my feelings are out of control.
(i've been a bad boy) 
detention with you is something i'd enjoy.
give me your lesson plan girl.
i'll pass your course.
i promise you won't regret.
making me your teacher's pet.

[CHORUS]

said hold up miss, said where you think you going?
(WHY?)
Cause i wanna go too.
(YOU KNOW YOU TOO YOUNG FOR ME) 
aw come on, baby, age ain't nothin but a number.
so tell me what you gon' do.
(YOU TRYNA GO TO THE OFFICE?)
if it's for you.
(BOY YOU SO CRAZY!)
only for you

i really wanna be yo man.
Why won't you give me a chance?
