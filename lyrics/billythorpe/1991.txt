Bullhorn: There is plenty of time. There is no need to panic. Please go directly to your shelters. There is plenty of time. I repeat, dont panic, there is plenty of time.

In nineteen ninety one the big war had begun
2 billion people lost their lives in the heat of the man made suns
The things that people tried to keep the earth alive
But Mother Earth was dyin from the ????? that was ?????

(Chorus)
In 1991, in 1991, in 1991
Nineteen hundred and ninety one

Gigantic ships arrived to save the millions that survived
And the entire population left with these children from the sky
Now travelers in time their journey had begun
The left the Earth forever for the Kingdom of the Sun

To the Kingdoms of the Sun
Now their journey has begun

Mothers fathers sons and daughters of the world your time has come
Leave the planet Earth forever for the Kingdoms of the Sun
Mothers fathers sons and daughters of the world your time has come
Leave the planet Earth forever for the Kingdoms of the Sun---Lyrics submitted by DR Hudspeth.
