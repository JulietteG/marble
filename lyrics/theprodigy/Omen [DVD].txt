It's an omen!

Now!

It's an omen!
Now!

Now!
The writing's on a wall
It won't go away

It's an omen!

It's an omen!

It's an omen!

Now!
The writing's on a wall
It won't go away

It's an omen!
You just run out of automation
Now!

Now!

Now!
The writing's on a wall
It won't go away

It's an omen!
You just run out of automation
Now!

The writing's on a wall
It won't go away
It's an omen (x3)

Now!

It's an omen!

Now! Now! Now!---Lyrics submitted by Ayesha.
