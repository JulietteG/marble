I read on your letter the other day
You don't care if crime don't pay
You got my girl now you're on the run
You won't come back, having a whole lotta fun

Kidnapper bring my baby back to me
Kidnapper you've got me in misery

The FBI is on your trail
Elliot Ness won't let you rest
Have Gun Will Travel is in the race
Said he'll get you if it takes all day

Kidnapper bring my baby back to me
Kidnapper you've got me in misery

Route 66 in the race
Perry Mason is gonna take my case
Hawiian Eye's got you on the run
He'll bring you in said Peter Gun

Kidnapper bring my baby back to me
Kidnapper you've got me in misery

Kidnapper you'll never never never be free
Kidnapper bring my baby back to me---Lyrics submitted by BILL BOUDREAUX.
