Taking all my bags, taking on the westbound line
Every time I loved, I always seemed to end up crying
So this is my goodbye, rolling all the way back home
You said you never loved me, I wish somehow I could have known

One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights (2x)

Back in Massachusetts, walking by the old high school
Just the way I left it, except this town is without you
Sulking under starlight, just cant keep you from my dreams
My motorcycle red light is ripping right down its seams 

One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights (2x)

One more tear to cry, here come the lonely nights (6x)---Lyrics submitted by Alan Loosbrock.
