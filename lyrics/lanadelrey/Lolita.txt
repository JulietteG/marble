Would you be mine, would you be my baby tonight
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got, don't you know
It's you that I adore, though I make the boys fall like dominoes

Kiss me in the d.a.r.k dark tonight
D.a.r.k do it my way
Kiss me in the p.a.r.k park tonight
P.a.r.k let them all say

Hey lolita, hey
Hey lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey lolita, hey
Hey lolita, hey
Whistle all you want but I'm not gonna say

Maybe was skipping love, skipping heart beats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat even when the sun goes down

I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky forty stories high
Shining like a god, can't believe I got you inside
Look at what I bought, not a second thought, oh romeo

Kiss me in the d.a.r.k dark tonight
D.a.r.k do it my way
Kiss me in the p.a.r.k park tonight
P.a.r.k let them all say

Hey lolita, hey
Hey lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey lolita, hey
Hey lolita, hey
Whistle all you want but I'm not gonna say

Maybe was skipping love, skipping heart beats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat even when the sun goes down

I want my cake and I want to eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair and my sun tan,
Short dress, bare feet
I don't care what they say about me, what they say about me
Because I know that it's l.o.v.e
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
Let them all say

Hey lolita, hey
Hey lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey lolita, hey
Hey lolita, hey
Whistle all you want but I'm not gonna say

Maybe was skipping love, skipping heart beats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat even when the sun goes down---Lyrics submitted by EvelinaEvelina.
