Elvis is my daddy, Marilyns my mother,
Jesus is my bestest friend.
We dont need nobody, we got each other,
At least I pretend.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancin and grindin in the pale moonlight.
Grand all the prayer, feelin alright,
She prays the rosary for my broken mind.

[Chorus:]
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric.
Im on fire, baby, Im on fire.

Whitman is my daddy, Monacos my mother,
Diamonds are my bestest friend.
Heaven is my baby, suicides her father,
Opulence is the end.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancin and grindin in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, feelin alright,
She prays the rosary for my broken mind.

[Chorus:]
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric.
Im on fire, baby, Im on fire.

My clothes still smell like you,
All the photographs say, that were still young.
I pretend Im not hurt,
I walk about the world like Im havin fun.
We get crazy every Friday night,
I drop it like its hot in the pale moonlight.
And when I pray, Im feelin alright,
Shes swayin softly, to her heart's delight.

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric.
Im on fire, sugar, Im on fire.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.---
