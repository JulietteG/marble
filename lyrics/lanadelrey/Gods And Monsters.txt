In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel
Living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

You got that medicine that I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing

No one's gonna take my soul away
Living like Jim Morrison
Heading towards a fucked up holiday
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing

Fuck yeah, give it to me
This is heaven
What I truly want
Is innocence lost?
Innocence lost?

In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel
Looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito
Posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

You got that medicine that I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'Baby that's alright with me'

No one's gonna take my soul away
Living like Jim Morrison
Heading towards a fucked up holiday
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing

Fuck yeah, give it to me
This is heaven
What I truly want
Is innocence lost?
Innocence lost?

When you talk, it's like a movie and you're making me crazy
'Cause life imitates art

If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard

No one's gonna take my soul away
Living like Jim Morrison
Heading towards a fucked up holiday
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing

Fuck yeah, give it to me
This is heaven
What I truly want
Is innocence lost?
Innocence lost? ---Lyrics submitted by lukas.
