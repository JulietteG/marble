You're no good for me,
baby you're no good for me. 
You're no good for me, 
but baby I want you, I want. 

Diet mountain Dew,
baby New York City.
Never was there ever a girl so pretty.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet Mountain Dew, 
baby New York City.
Can we get it now low, down and gritty.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Baby put on your heart shape sunglasses, 
cause we're gonna take a ride.
I'm not going to listen to what the past says,
I've been waiting up all night. 
Take another drag, turn me to ashes.
Ready for another lie?
Says he's going to teach me just what fast is.
Says it's gonna be alright.

Diet mountain Dew,
baby New York City.
Never was there ever a girl so pretty.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet Mountain Dew, 
baby New York City.
Can we get it now low, down and gritty.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Lets take Jesus off the dashboard,
got enough on his mind.
We both know what just we're here for,
saved too many times.
Maybe i like this roller coaster, 
maybe it keeps me high.
Maybe the speed it keeps me closer,
I could sparkle up your eye.

Diet mountain Dew,
baby New York City.
Never was there ever a girl so pretty.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet Mountain Dew, 
baby New York City.
Can we get it now low, down and gritty.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

You're no good for me,
baby you're no good for me. 
You're no good for me,
but baby I want you, I want you. 

You're no good for me, 
baby you're no good for me.
You're no good for me,
but baby i want you, i want you.
I want you.

Diet mountain Dew,
baby New York City.
Never was there ever a girl so pretty.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Maybe stop at 7-11,
There in his white Pontiac heaven.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you thin We'll be in love?

Diet mountain Dew,
baby New York City.
Never was there ever a girl so pretty.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet Mountain Dew, 
baby New York City.
Can we get it now low, down and gritty.
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

You're no good for me,
baby you're no good for me. 
You're no good for me, 
but baby I want you, I want. (3x)---Lyrics submitted by Madison King.
