Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment
You for the moment, Boy Blue, yeah you

You're feelin' hot at the show, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you'll miss me the most, I say I'll miss you so much
Something keeps me real quiet, I'm alive I'm a-lush
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigon
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock and roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

You push it hard up all the way, Im feeling hot and on fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel Im a child
They all say "oh, cario", boy, its you I desire
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love ---
