Darling, oh darling, 
won't you come back my way?
It's been ever so lonely 
since you went away. 

My heart is a breaking
I miss your sweet face
My arms are an aching
for your sweet embrace. 

Winter lies thick 
on the rooftops and streets. 
A wasteland of white
has buried us deep. 
I'm cold all the time 
from my head to my feet, 
but my heart is the coldest
now that you left me to weep. 

Lonely, this world feels so lonely
now that you've up and left me
with the snow coming down.

Well I'm hoping and praying 
for you to return. 
Bring warmth to my heart
and spring to this town. 

Empty, this world feels so empty
Now that you're nowhere near me, 
nowhere to be found. 

Well I'm hoping and praying
for you to return. 
Melt the ice around my heart
and the snow on the ground. 
Melt the ice around my heart
and the snow on the ground.---Lyrics submitted by Paige Dakota.
