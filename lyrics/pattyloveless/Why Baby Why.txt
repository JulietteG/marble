Tell me why baby why baby why baby
 why you make me cry baby cry baby cry baby cry,
Well, I gotta a crow I wanna pick with you just like last time when the feathers flew 
your running wild kickin up your heels  and leavin me home with a handful of bills,
 I can't live with out you and you know that its true but theres no livin with you so what do I do I'm going honky tonkin  get as tight as a spring maybe by then you'll appreciate a good thing,

Chorus:
Tell me why baby why baby why baby 
why you make me cry baby cry baby cry baby cry,
I can't live with out you till the day that I die so tell me why baby why baby why baby why

 Well I don't know but i've heard say, every little dog is gonna have his day, so you better pay attention don't ya dare forget cause I'm just a little bitty puppy yet,
I caught you honky tonkin with my best friend the thing to do was leave ya I should've left then you know I still love you but I still get sore when you come home feelin for the knob on the door.

Repeat Chorus

oooooh why baby why baby why baby 
why you make me cry baby cry baby cry baby cry.---Lyrics submitted by Sophia.
