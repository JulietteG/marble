Latley things haven't been goin' our way
And this road seems to get steeper every day
You crawl inside yourself
When I pull you out we fight
Seems like you've forgotten
I'm on your side 

Do you think it makes you more of a man
To shoulder the worry and shield me if you can
But its this wall of silence
That's enough to make me scream
Tear it down and you'll find out
We're on the same team 

I'm on your side when you don't know where to turn
Look to the left or just to the right
Turn to me when you can't turn off the lights
I'm on your side 

Don't you remember how close we used to be
When you come home and vent your heart and soul to me 

I'm on your side
When you don't know where to turn
Look to the left or just to the right
Turn to me when you can't turn off the lights
I'm on your side 

Turn to me when you can't turn off the lights
I'm on your side---
