Say it's alright
Say it's alright
It's alright, have a good time
Cause it's alright, whoa it's alright

Were gonna move it slow
When lights are low
When you move it slow
It sounds like more (?) 
Cause it's alright
Whoa it's alright

Now listen to the beat
Kinda tap your feet
You got soul
Everybody knows that it's alright
Whoa it's alright

When you wake up early in the morning
Feeling sad like so many of us do
Hum a little soul
Make life your goal
And surely something's gotta come to you

And say it's alright
Say it's alright
It's alright, have a good time
Cause it's alright
Whoa it's alright

Now everybody clap your hands
Give yourself a chance
You got soul
Everybody knows that it's alright
Whoa it's alright 

Someday I'll find me a woman
Who will love and treat me real nice
Where my road has got to go (?) 
My love she will know from morning, noon
Until the night

And she's gotta say that it's alright
Say it's alright
It's alright, have a good time
Cause it's alright
Whoa it's alright
Everybody clap your hands
Now give yourself a chance
You got soul---Lyrics submitted by Barrie.
