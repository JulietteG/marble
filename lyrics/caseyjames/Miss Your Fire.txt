Its 3 a.m. and Im wide awake
I keep wondering where you are
This empty ache, it cuts through me
Like a piece of glass in the heart

Oh, I miss your fire
Oh, I miss your fire

Your passion made me feel alive
Like the blue inside of a flame
Well, I cant get you off my mind
It burns me when I hear your name

Oh, I miss your fire
Oh, I miss your fire

This bed is freezing cold
I never felt so alone
And I cant get you off my mind
Theres so much that we left unsaid
So much that I cant forget
I just wanna hold you tonight

Im tossin, turnin in these sheets
You still keep me up all night
I miss the way you werent ashamed
The way you never closed your eyes

Oh, I miss your fire
Oh, I miss your fire
Miss your fire
I miss your fire---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
