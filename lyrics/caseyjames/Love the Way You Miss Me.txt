Girl, the way youre talking now
And everything were talking bout
There aint no way, no how
That I can put this phone down
Even though were miles apart
I can feel you touching my heart
Lying here in the dark
Wishing I was where you are

Baby, youre driving me crazy
Girl, if I could, you know I would
Id be right there, right now
Oh, baby, youre making me lose my mind
And Im counting down the days til I get home
I love the way you miss me when Im gone

You know what I wanna hear
Girl, youre coming in loud and clear
Its sweet music to my ears
Oh, what Id do if you were here

Baby, youre driving me crazy
Girl, if I could, you know I would
Id be right there right now
Oh, baby, youre making me lose my mind
And Im counting down the days til I get home
I love the way you miss me when Im gone

Girl, I hate these nights
When I cant hold you tight
Cause I know by your side
Is right where I belong

Baby, youre driving me crazy
Girl, if I could, you know I would
Id be right there right now
Oh, baby, youre making me lose my mind
And Im counting down the days til I get home
I love the way you miss me when Im gone---Lyrics submitted by Jen Lloyd.
