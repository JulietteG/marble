To prove to you my love. is so deep within
Its even getting deeper
Since I reach prison

When when when when?
Can we see each other again
When when when when?
Can we see each other again
I know there's someone, must be there comforting you
Whenever you need a friend
I'll make you mine, give me some time, I'll surely make you mine
It may be long but not forever.
I vow, to get myself together
I love you baby, always on my mind, No matter the time.
