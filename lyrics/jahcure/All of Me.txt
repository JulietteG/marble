What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in then you kicking me out
Got my head spinning, no kidding
I cant pin you down
Whats going on in your beautiful mind
Am on your magical mystery rhyme
And am so dizzy, than no addict mi
But Ill be alright

My heads on the water am breathing fine
Your crazy and am out of my mind

Cause all a me, loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfection

Give your all to me, I give my all to you
Your my end and my beginning
Even when I lose am winning

Cause I give you all of me
You give me all of you

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when your crying your beautiful too
The world is beating you, now am around
For every mood, your my downfall
Your my amused, my worst distraction
My rhythm and blues
I cant stop sing and its ringing in my head for you

My heads on the water am breathing fine
Your crazy and am out of my mind

My heads on the water am breathing fine
Your crazy and am out of my mind---
