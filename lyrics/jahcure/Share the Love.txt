Theres a light that cannot shine
Until you come into my life
And love reveals you will be the one
The one for me

And Ill give you all I have to give
All the love, all the joy my heart can give
Hoping you will share the same with me

(Come share my love) Come share my love {Come on share my love}
(Come share my joy) Come share my joy {Come share my joy}
(Come share my joy) Come share my love
Wont you come share with me, pretty baby
Come into my life, share my love

Theres a peak on every mountain, a shore for every sea
Its hard to under stand, were you meant for me
Theres an answer to the question
But theres no guarantee

And Ill give you all I have to give
All the love, all the joy my heart can give
Hoping you will share the same with me, ooh, hoo

(Come share my love) Come share my love {Come on share my love}
(Come share my joy) Come share my joy {Come share my joy}
(Come share my joy) Come share my love
Wont you come share with me, pretty baby
Come into my life, share my love

Oh...
(Come share my love) Share my love, wont you share my love
(Come share my joy) Wont you come on and share my joy
(Come share my love) Share my love, share my love
(Come share my joy) Share my, my joy

(Come share my love)
(Come share my joy) Come on and share my joy
(Come share my love) Come on share my love
(Come share my joy) Wont you come on and share my joy

(Come share my love) Come share...
(Come share my joy) My-my-my-my-my-my-my love, come on, baby
(Come share my love) Share, share my love
(Come share my joy) Ooh doo doo doo doo doo doo

(Come share my love)
(Come share my joy)
(Come share my love) Come on, baby, share my love
(Come share my joy) Ooh...ooh...come on, baby

(Come share my love) Share my love
(Come share my joy) Share my-my-my-my-my joy, come on
(Come share my love)
