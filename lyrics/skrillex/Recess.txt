Fight till we can't fight
Everybody's alright
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop
D-don't let it stop, make it to the daylight

Turn it up!
Turn it up!
Harder!
Harder!
T-turn it up, t-t-t-t-turn it up
T-turn it up, t-t-t-t-turn it up

Bass drop!

Everybody listen to me
On the count of three
We gon' go all together
Right here, right now
1... 2... 3 Everybody just
Everybody just
Everybody just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
J-j-just bounce
All the ladies, put your hands in the air
Say we don't care (We don't care!)
All the fellas, put your hands in the air
Say we don't care (We don't care!)

Fight till we can't fight
Everybody's alright
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop
D-don't let it stop, make it to the daylight

T-turn it up, t-t-t-t-turn it up
T-turn it up, t-t-t-t-turn it up

Bass drop!

Take it to the daylight!
Everybody alright---
