(feat. Niki & The Dove)

In a, in a deep sleep
Awakened, by the trackers
Kept you hidden, here with me
Was not prepared, for a dead end

Take me, take me downtown
Tonight, I want to forget
I want lights to, blind me
I want beat, want to disappear (to dissapear)

Oh DJ, ease my mind will you
Play that song again, cause we were in love
Before, before the rain began
And if I cry, I cover my ears

Oh DJ

Oh DJ

[DROP]

Play that song again, cause we were in love
Oh

[DROP]

Pla-pla-pla-pla-play that song again, cause we were in love

Take me, take me downtown
Tonight, I want to forget
I want lights to, blind me
I want peace, want to disappear

Oh DJ, ease my mind will you
Play that song again, cause we were in love
Before, before the rain began
And if I cry-y, cover my ears

Oh DJ

Oh DJ

[DROP]

Pla-pla-pla-pla-play that song again, cause we were in love

Oh DJ
Ease my mind, will you?
Play that song again
Cause we were in love
(DJ)

Oh DJ ---
