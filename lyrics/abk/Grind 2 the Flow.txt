Yo, im a little hipper than the average hop, 
I'm the type of motha fucka you cant stop
Especially those that make me mad 
Cause i can be the worst enemy that you ever had
So if you knew me then, then  you know me now
And for all the virgin ears its our plan to bust you out
I'll be all in your face but hard to find 
Underground livin so this killa can hustle and grind

The life that you live, is it real or are you fakin
Those moves you make, are they from your heart or were you persuaded
So imma grind to the flow, grind to the flow, grind to the flow
So imma grind to the flow, grind to the flow, grind to the flow

You know everytime i spit it people get it 
Cause we connected and everytime we get
Together we wreck shit ill pay dues to make 
Moves just like the next man soul of a warrior 
Come and catch me if you can some of yall 
Recognize real shit while others are influenced 
They just take it like a bitch so if you real with 
The words that you spill aint no reason you
Should feel anything you do is ill 

The life that you live, is it real or are you fakin
Those moves you make, are they from your heart or were you persuaded
So imma grind to the flow, grind to the flow, grind to the flow
So imma grind to the flow, grind to the flow, grind to the flow

I got some courage and a heavy hittin heart beat
I got the attitude to survive in the streets
I got the wisdom of an old school cat 
With my mind set on one thing TAKING IT BACK
I got the nerves to go do watever cause there 
Really aint too many out here doin it better
So when you see me keep one thing in mind that 
This muthafuckin killa is always on his grind

The life that you live is it real or are you fakin
Those moves you make are they from your heart or were you persuaded
So imma grind to the flow, grind to the flow, grind to the flow
So imma grind to the flow, grind to the flow, grind to the flow

The life that you live is it real or are you fakin
Those moves you make are they from your heart or were you persuaded
So imma grind to the flow, grind to the flow, grind to the flow 
So imma grind to the flow, grind to the flow, grind to the flow

Alright y'all hold up        Hey, Hey MaMa---Lyrics submitted by Jonathan.
