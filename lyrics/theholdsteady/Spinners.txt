Before she figures out what's wrong
They put another record on.
She picks it up and she carries the cross.
Heartbreak hurts but you can dance it off.
Sure some nights she'll curse these clubs
Shes two years off some prairie town
She goes out most every night.
She dresses up and she spins around.

The same guy buys another round
To let her know he's interested.
The nights go on forever now
But the morning comes up quick.
You've got to loosen your grip.

Never let them tie you up
It's a big city, there's a lot of love.
Salted rims and frosted mugs.
You gotta get back out there.

Flat champagne and inbound trains.
Soft hands and phantom pains.
Never let them tie you up.
It's a big city, there's a lot of love.

Once she's pretty sure it's safe
She goes to a different place.
Decides she's gonna get some guy
Before she even finds him.
Then she's got him if she wants him
But she cant decide if she wants him.
She goes out almost every night.
She cuddles up and she spins aside.

Never let them tie you up
It's a big city, there's a lot of love.
Salted rims and frosted mugs.
You gotta get back out there.

Flat champagne and inbound trains.
Soft hands and phantom pains.
Never let them tie you up.
It's a big city, there's a lot of love.

She's two years off some prairie town.
She dresses up and she spins around.
Little looks and smaller talk.
Heartbreak hurts but you can dance it off.

She's two years off some prairie town.
She dresses up and she spins around.
She never lets them tie her down.
Its a big city and there's just so much love.

Once you're out there everything is possible.
There might be a fight. There might be a miracle.
Loosen your grip, it feels so incredible.
Let the city live your life for you tonight.

Once you're out there everything is possible.
Even the bad nights they aren't all that terrible.
Loosen your grip, it feels so incredible.
Let the city live your life for you tonight.

Never let them tie you up.
It's a big city, there's a lot of love.
Salted rims and frosted mugs.
It's a big city there's a lot of love.
Tavern wine and tiny bugs.
It's a big city there's a lot of love.
Never let them tie you up.
It's a big city.---
