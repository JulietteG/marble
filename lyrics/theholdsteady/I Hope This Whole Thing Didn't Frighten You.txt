I heard the Cityscape Skins are kind of kicking it again
heard they finally got some discipline
running up the score and stocking up
like its World War IV
I heard that some are getting sprung
and some are back in
you know it's always back and forth
and some of them are dead and most of them
don't even live here anymore

So when I brought you back here for Christmas
I didn't think we would see them
I guess I should've explained

(Chorus)
There was a side of this city I didn't want you to see
There's just these guys that I know we go back pretty deep
and I hope this whole thing didn't frighten you
there were times that it terrified me
I know what they said, I don't know if its true
I hope this whole thing didn't frighten you

They're building a bunker down by the river
someone said that's where they've been getting together
they've got masks for the gas
they're sleeping in bulletproof vests
I guess Shepard came out of St Cloud with a little ideology
its a different way of thinking, man
a view to the future
Jesus, this might be a mess

For me it was mostly the music
a crew to go to the shows with
I guess I should've explained

(Chorus)

They never care if it's true
as long as they got something to prove
and they always got something to prove

and they run from the dudes
and they cranked up the tunes
I can tell this whole thing kind of frightened you

(Chorus)
I saw you look at their shoes
I saw you look at their teeth
I can tell this whole thing kind of frightened you
saw you tappin' your arm like
you wanted to cruise
I can tell this whole thing kind of frightened you---
