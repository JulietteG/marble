Some days I sit around and I wonder what goes on outside my door
Some days this crazy world I don't wanna be part of anymore
Outside far away, everyone in emergency
But outside of my window everything looks just perfect to me
So why can't the rest of the world be more like the corner of my street?

Where the troubles are of a simple kind
Where people don't mind who you are, where you're from
They're colorblind
Colorblind
At the corner of my street

On a beautiful day like this,I wish everyone would just share my view
Out of the people I see, everyone knows exactly what to do, mm
More than a block away, people they say are crying for help
But out here we cant hear them, everyone's just enjoying themselves, yeah
So why can't the rest of the world be more like the corner of my street?

Where the troubles are of a simple kind
Where people don't mind who you are, where you're from
They're colorblind
Colorblind
At the corner of my street
We're all colorblind
At the corner of my street

Why can't the rest of the world be more like the corner of my street?
Why can't the rest of the world be more like the corner of my street?---Lyrics submitted by Litza.
