It's been different since you're gone
Oh, but one thing never changed, (yeah)
I still hate to say I'm wrong,
Girl, but I'm tellin' you, (yeah yea)

Baby, come back in my world now
Cause lately, it's been kind of lonely
Baby, I've got to be honest
That maybe, I can't live without you

If I open up my door,
Oh, would you please, consider looking in, (yeah yea)
And if I do you can be sure,
That I'll be there, on my knees, begging you

Baby, come back in my world now
Cause lately, it's been kind of lonely (oh)
Baby, I've got to be honest
That maybe, I can't live without you (oh)

Everyone, I say, deserves a chance
To make up for their mistakes, (yes they do now)
And my biggest one, was to let you go
I'm gonna do, whatever it takes
Baby, hey
(Baby, come back into my world)

Baby, come back in my world now
Because lately, it's been kind of lonely lonely lonely (yeah)
Baby, I've got to be honest
That maybe baby, I can't live without you by my side

Baby, come back in my world now
Cause lately, it's been kind of lonely (it's been kind of lonely girl)
You got to come back, baby (back in my world)
Cause lady, I can't live without you, by my side---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
