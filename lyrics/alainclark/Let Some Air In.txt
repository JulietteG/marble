Hey there girl, here's a little song for ya 
Keep in mind that it's only my words 
I want to tell you a little bit about me 
I was once lost, gone from the centre 
couldn't tell what direction I was going in 
Followed the signs of another man's promise 
Yeah another man's promise 

Oh I turn to the outside for answers 
But I knew I could only find within 
And the question grew like a cancer 
Making my mind and my body lame (?) 
I wish there was a backway out 
I wish there was a backway out 

I turn to the mirror to find me 
Then close my eyes again 
then I open the window behind me and let some air in 

Held my breath as I swam to the surface 
The higher I got the stronger the current 
I was so afraid that I'd drown 
As I was slowly sinking back down 

I look to the sky for the answers 
that I knew I could only find within 
And I put all my hopes in tomorrow 
as I didn't know where to begin 
I wish there was a backway out 
I wish there was a backway out 

I turn to the mirror to find me 
Then close my eyes again 
then I open the window behind me 
and let some air in 
Oh let some air in 
let some air in (7x) 

I turn to the outside for answers 
that I knew I could only find within 
and the question grew like a cancer 
making my mind and my body lame (?) 
I wish there was a backway out 
I wish there was a backway out 

I turn to the mirror to find me 
Then close my eyes again 
then I open the window behind me 
and let some air in 

Then I turn to the mirror to find me 
Then close my eyes again 
then I open the window behind me 
and let some air in 
Let some air in (4x)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
