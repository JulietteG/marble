Call of a dog, cry of a bitch
Cream of a dream is the cause of the itch
Call of the doctor, cash on demand
If you get enough rope, might even hang

CHORUS:
C.O.D. - care of the devil
C.O.D. - the devil in me
C.O.D. - care of the devil
Care of the devil in me

The curse of love is the cause of the pain
The crime of the day is when you do it again
Call of the doctor, cash on demand
If you give them a finger, they'll take off your hand

CHORUS
(Down to the devil with me)

Call of a dog, cry of a bitch
The sign of the sinner is the size of his itch

CHORUS

I'm paying, paying, I'm paying C.O.D.
Care of the devil, care of the devil in me
It's the curse of love---Lyrics submitted by Matt.
