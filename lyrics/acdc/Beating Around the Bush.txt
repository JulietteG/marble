Smilin' face and laughin' eyes
But ya can't keep on tellin' me all those lies
How'd you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive
Baby I got my eye on you
Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your cryin' and dry your tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears

You can throw me lefts, you can throw me rights
But where was you last night
Beatin' around the bush

Wish I knew what was on your mind
Why you bein' so unkind
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talkin' on the telephone
Thoughts of you goin' through my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You said that you loved me too
But tell me who was there with you

I was talkin' birds, and you was talkin' bees
And was he down on his knees
Beatin' around the bush

You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You've eaten your cake you want some more
I'm gonna give you just a one more change
Try to save our romance
I've done everything I'm gonna do
The rest is up to you

And you can chew it up, you can spit it out
You can let it all hang out
Beatin' around the bush

And you can chew it up, you can spit it out
You can let it all hang out
Beatin' around the bush---Lyrics submitted by David.
