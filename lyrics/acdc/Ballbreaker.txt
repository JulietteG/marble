Breakin' balls, Bangin' walls

Work hard and tough, and I want some rough
Unpack my bags, and take a drag
When bang on nine, and [I'm] dead on time

Open up the door
And lay upon the floor
She open her overcoat
Livin' out her dreams
Rippin' off my jeans

You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

Engine roll, and time to go
A razorback, a hog attack
[I'm] Buildin' steam, [for] whippin' cream
She likes a fat, smokin' stack

Hangin' off her legs
She threw me on the bed

Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
She said, Honey shoot your load [Honey shoot your load]

You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

Yeah
Wreckin' ball, let it roll
You are a Ballbreaker
Buildin' steam, for whippin' cream
You are a Ballbreaker

Hangin' off her legs
She threw me on the bed

Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
Honey shoot your load
You are a Ballbreaker
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
