If you're,
havin' trouble with the high school head,
he's givin' you the blues.
You wanna graduate but not in his bed,
here's what you gotta' do.
Pick up the phone, I'm always home,
call me anytime,
Just ring 36,24,36, hey!
I lead a life of crime,

Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap.
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap.
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap.

Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap. Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.

You got problems in your life of love,
you've got a broken heart.
He's double dealin' with your best friend, thats when the teardrops start, fella'.

Pick up the phone, I'm here alone,
oh make a social call.
Come right in,
forget about him,
we'll have ourselves a ball.

Dirty deeds,Done dirt cheap.
Dirty deeds,Done dirt cheap.
Dirty deeds,Done dirt cheap.

Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap. Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.

If 'ya,
got a lady and 'ya want her gone,
but you ain't got the guts.
She keeps naggin' at 'ya night and day,
enough to drive you nuts.

Pick up the phone,
leave her alone.
It's time you made a stand.
For a fee,
I'm happy to be,
your back door man.

Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap.
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap.
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap.

Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.


Concrete shoes,
cyanide, TNT!
Done dirt cheap!

Neckties, contracts,
high voltage!
Done dirt cheap!

Dirty Deeds,
done dirt cheap!
Dirty Deeds,
done dirt cheap!

Dirty deeds!
Doin' what I think you want me to!
Done dirt cheap!
Dirty deeds, dirty deeds.
Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap!

Yaaahhhhh!---Lyrics submitted by Jerry.
