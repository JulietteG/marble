He be the count of Monte Cristo
Could be a quake any day
Maybe somebody from Siam
Begin the era of a new rage
Keeps lickin' all the honey
Chewin' up the fat he rakes
Instead of sending to the lions
They cover him with praise
All hail Cesar, Hail, Hail!
All hail Cesar, Hail, Hail!
Down at the epicenter
Things started heatin' up
Rockin' on the richter scale
Swinging in the chariot
Around and around we go
The senators rehearse the tale
Starring in the coliseum
Tied upon the rack
Up comes the thumb of Cesar
To stab you in the back
All hail Cesar, Hail, Hail!
All hail Cesar, Hail, Hail!
Down at the epicenter
Things started heatin' up
Rockin' on the richter scale
Swingin' in the chariot
Around and around we go
the Senators rehearse the tale
"Watch out Cesar, watch out Cesar"
[I said hail, I said hail!
I said Hail, I said Hail!
Hail
Hail
Hail
Hail
Hail
Hail
Hail
Hail
Hail ]
[All hail Cesar, hail, hail!
All hail Cesar, hail, hail!
All hail Cesar, hail, hail!
All hail Cesar, hail, hail!
You need eyes in the back of your head boy,
or you're dead.]---Lyrics submitted by Lisa.
