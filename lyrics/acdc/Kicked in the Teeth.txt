Two faced woman with your two faced lies
I hope your two faced livin' made you satisfied
Ya tell me baby I was your only one
While you been runnin' round town with every mother's son, hey!

Two times told about a woman like you
Two times told about the things you do
I used to think that you were sugar and spice
I should have listened to my Ma's advice

Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain't this misery ever gonna end?
I been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again

Two faced woman such a cryin' shame
Double or nothin' you're all the same
You run around hope you had your fun
You never know who's gonna win 'til the race been run

Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win, I know
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain't this misery ever gonna end?
I been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again---Lyrics submitted by David.
