Take up all your time,
Kick up your heels, lookin fine,
And you come riding blind,
You come rollin back a while,
Wind blowin on ya,
Were gonna move on and on,
Sweating heat, soak you all,
Being out will make you crawl all night,

Decibel, decibel,

Has you from deep inside,
You were waving then you smiled,
Give me rock and roll,
Theyre in love,
Love, in the rain,
Theyre in there rocking standing proud,

Decibel,
Thats the history of rock and roll,
Decibel,

(Guitar Solo)

Rain is coming on,
Were gonna ride along,
A hundred miles in all,
Getting in night til dawn,
Spread the joy going on,
Yeah, hard and long,
Staring down, with a shock hit the ground,

Decibel,
Decibel,
Decibel,
You come rolling back a while,
Decibel,
Decibel---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
