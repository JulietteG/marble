It is my mission
To seek you out
You up for grabs honey
Well then don't make a sound

Getting it up
Get high off the ground
Giving it up
Not fooling around
Rigging it up
You can't be here and be shy
Raising it up
Six guns to the sky

Calling emission control
Emission control
Calling emission control
Emission control
It's good for the soul

Turn on emission
The engine comes alive
She takes to pairing mama
Like a lion ready to strike
Ready to strike
Hey ya

Fire it up
Take full flight and fly
Fire it up
You got to raise it on high
Rigging it up
You can't be here and be shy
Raising it up
Six guns to the sky
Giving it up
Keeping it up

Calling emission control
Emission control yeah
Calling emission control
Emission control
It's good for the soul

Giving it up
Getting it up
Raising it up
Just giving it up
Keeping it up
Giving it up---
