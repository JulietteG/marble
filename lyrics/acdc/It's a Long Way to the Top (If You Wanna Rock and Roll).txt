Ridin down the highway 
goin to a show 
stopin all the by-ways
playin rock n roll
getting robbed 
getting stoned
getting beat up
broken bone
gettin had
gettin took
I tell you folks
its harder than it looks

Chorus:
Its a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll (+2)

If you think its easy doin one night stands
try playin in a rock roll band

Chorus (+1)

(Instrumental)

Hotel motel
make you wanna cry
lady do the hard sell
Know the reason why
gettin old
gettin grey
gettin ripped off
under-paid
gettin sold 
second hand
thats how it goes
playin in a band

Chorus (+2)

If you want to be a star of stage and screen
look out its rough and mean 

Chorus(+4)


Its a long way (+4)
