I used to walk this town
With my head hanging down
I felt so alone
I was so close to giving up
Lost all hope in love
So far from home
Oh, oh,

Thank You for finding me when You did
You changed my life, now I believe
That love is all, that I'll ever need
I promise my heart and all that I am
I'm Yours forever my love

You came and You rescued me
Showed me life as it's meant to be
So beautiful
You love me so differently
Chase all my fears away
I'm finally whole
Oh, oh,

Thank You for finding me when You did
You changed my life, now I believe
That love is all, that I'll ever need
I promise my heart and all that I am

I'm with You
You're right beside me
I feel You near
Right here to guide me
I'm with You
You're right beside me
To guide me home

Thank You for finding me when You did
You changed my life, now I believe
That love is all, that I'll ever need
I promise my heart and all that I am
I'm Yours forever my love---
