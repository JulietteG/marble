How can you move, when theyre weighing you down? 
What can you do, when youre tied to the ground? Yeah.
You carry your burdens, heavy like gravity.
Just let them go now; theres freedom in release.

Chorus: 
You cant run when youre holding suitcases, 
Its a new day; throw away your mistakes,
And open up your heart, lay down your guard.
You dont have to be afraid.

Just breathe; your love can be lifted
Theres a better way when you know youre forgiven
Open up your heart, lay down your guard
You dont have to be afraid.


Can you imagine what its like to be free? Oooh.
Well send those bags packing; theyre not what you need. Oooh.
Abandon your troubles, by the side of the street.
Just let them go now, believe me. 

Chorus:
You cant run when youre holding suitcases, 
Its a new day; throw away your mistakes,
And open up your heart, lay down your guard.
You dont have to be afraid.

Just breathe; your love can be lifted
Theres a better way when you know youre forgiven
Open up your heart, lay down your guard
You dont have to be afraid.

Bridge: 
Theres nothing holding you back now.
Just run. Oooh. 

Chorus:
You cant run when youre holding suitcases, 
Its a new day; throw away your mistakes,
And open up your heart, lay down your guard.
You dont have to be afraid.

Just breathe; your love can be lifted
Theres a better way when you know youre forgiven
Open up your heart, lay down your guard
You dont have to be, you dont have to be afraid.

You dont have to be afraid.---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
