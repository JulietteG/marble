On the quiet night I met you
The wind swam through your hair
It was dancing at my eyelids
And I know you saw me there

I was standing in the low light
As you sang into the room
And I was lonely as a tombstone
You were holy as a tomb

On the night I met your lover
He held his body close
He knew my bones were howlin'
But I blamed it on the ghosts

I chose my words like sunday dress
My truth could not be found
But the truth is I will take his love
And lay her body down

On the frigid night I met you
I tried to hold my tongue
My body was evoked with
The weakness of the young

I felt our heat connected
Through the thick haze of the room
I was lonely as a tombstone
You were holy as a tomb

On the night I left my lover
He held his head down low
My skin was cold and silver
But I blamed it on the snow

As slippy signed the fire
But the warmth will not be found
Till you take me in your sun kissed arms
And lay my body down---Lyrics submitted by Matt Skanderup.
