Once I was straying in sin's dark valley
No hope within could I see;
They searched thru heaven, and found a Savior
To save a poor lost soul like me.

CHORUS:
O what a Savior, O hallelujah,
His heart was broken, on Calvary;
His hands were nail-scarred, His side was riven,
He gave his life blood for even me.

He left the Father, with all His riches
With calmness sweet and serene;
Came down from heaven, and gave his life blood
To make the vilest of sinners clean.

Death's chilly waters, I'll soon be crossing
His hand will lead me safely o'er;
I'll join the chorus, in that great city,
And sing up there forever more.---Lyrics submitted by Leon.
