Don't you ever, be sad
Lean on me, when times get bad
When the day comes, and youre down
In a river of trouble, and about to drown

Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming

I'm on my way, your lover 
If your get cold yeah, I will be your cover
Dont  have to worry, because I am here
Dont need to suffer baby, cause I am near

Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming

Look it here!
Reach out to me, for satisfaction Yeah
Look it here babe, heres all ya got to do 
Call my name yeah, for a quick reaction
Yeah, yeah, yeah, YEAH!

(Solo)

Now dont you ever, be sad,
Lean on me, when the times are bad,
When the day comes, and youre down baby
In a river of trouble, and about to drown

Hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, cause I'm coming
Just hold on,  (Dont you worry) cause I'm coming (Here we come)
Hold on, (I'm like a train) Im coming (Yeah)
Hold on, (Dont you worry) I'm coming (Here I come)
Hold on, (For satisfaction) I'm coming (Dont you worry)---Lyrics submitted by Tony.
