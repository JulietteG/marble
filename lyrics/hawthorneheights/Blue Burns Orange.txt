Bleed these colors open wide
Burning blues from butterflies
(Tonight we, Tonight we fly)
Flying faster through the night
Until the orange of morning light
(Dear black goodbye, Dear black goodbye)

I know it's hard to make this work
When you're all alone (Alone)

And I've been waiting for so long
To hold you in my arms
Embrace forever my sweet girl

Water fills these open eyes 
(Tonight we fly)
Still frames and valentines
Won't keep me in her mind
(Dear black goodbye, Dear black goodbye)

I know it's hard to make this work
When you're all alone (Alone)

And I've been waiting for so long
To hold you in my arms
Embrace forever my sweet girl
[x2]

You are the ghost of everything 
that I'm not and I want to be
[x2]

Dear black goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't forget to write 
Your name inside (Goodbye) 
Of my life

And I know it's hard to make this work
When you're all alone

I've been waiting for so long
To hold you in my arms
And I've been waiting for so long
To hold you in my arms
Embrace forever my sweet girl---Lyrics submitted by Ronnie.
