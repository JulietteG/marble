Let's go down now
into the darkness
of your thoughts 

hurry up now
we're waiting for
us to fall
fall to pieces now 
a broken mirror 
in your life

Silence in black and white
falling forward as she 
walks towards the light

RIGHT NOW,
I'm outside of your window 
with my radio 

I sleep with one eye open so I can
see you breathing 
I follow your chest bone 
Until I, 
I can see you, 
I can hear you 
breathe in... 
exhale

Silence in black and white

RIGHT NOW, 
I'm outside of your window with my radio
RIGHT NOW, 
I'm outside of your window with my radio

I'm outside of your window with my radio(x3)

I'm outside of your window with my radio
you are the only station
you play the song I know
you are the song I know.---Lyrics submitted by Eileen.
