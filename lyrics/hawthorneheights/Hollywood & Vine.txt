The Clouds Settle on the city 
its a canopy for movie scenes
a backdrop full of hope and dreams

the harder they try the further they fall
their learning their lines and waiting for calls
to be the next face that takes the place 
of the one you used to love

here we go, here we go again this time
did you leave your heart tonight
on hollywood and vine
in the corner of your mind, shes waiting for a ride
to the other side of hollywood and vine

no longer anonymous
the shine of fame has turned to rust
and you're the one whos wasted
every single chance you never took

the longer they wait the further they are
[| From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/h/hawthorne-heights-lyrics/hollywood-&-vine-lyrics.html |]
they got what it takes no matter the part
to be the next face that takes the place
of the one you used to love

here we go, here we go again this time
did you leave your heart tonight
on Hollywood and vine
in the corner of your mind, shes waiting for a ride
to the other side of Hollywood and Vine

in the corner of your mind (woah)
shes waiting for a ride (woah)
(woah)
(woah)


here we go, here we go again this time
did you leave your heart tonight
on Hollywood and vine
in the corner of your mind, shes waiting for a ride
to the other side of Hollywood and Vine...---Lyrics submitted by thomas sands.
