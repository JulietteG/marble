I had a dream last night
when I awoke the sky was on fire
there was a war outside 
but on the death of our own desire
history repeats itself
we are a people in need of help
with fragile lives and brittle bones
we all fall down
my memories of misery wont save me from the storm
I lie awake till the sun comes up
and the water breaks on the shore
a bond is unbroken 
alot of words are left unspoken
your left out in the freezing cold 
I'll fight for you and streets fight with gold
in our fragile lives with brittle bones
we all fall down
my memories of misery wont save me from the storm
I lie awake till the sun comes up 
and the water breaks on the shore
dont leave me now im drowning
and all I have has been lost
these memories of misery are all I've got
tomorrow has left me behind
now im stuck in yesterday
your attic is flowing like wine
from all the choices we make
I know that times no longer on our side
but our skeletons will remain
my darling i wont let this die
and our voices can not be chained
my memories of misery wont save me from the storm 
I lie awake till the sun comes up 
and the water breaks on the shore
don't leave me now I'm drowning 
and all I have has been lost
these memories of misery are all I've got---Lyrics submitted by RyanB.
