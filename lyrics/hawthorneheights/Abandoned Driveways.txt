Breathe me in I am your nicotine 
I'll fill your lungs until you cannot breathe
Swallow me down I am your alcohol
I'll fill your gut with all the pain and loss

When you pass out so you can sleep it off

Bloodshot eyes don't tell the truth
Abandoned drives lead to abuse
But I won't let you get away so soon

Roll the dice you'll either win or lose
Your alibi has gotten me confused
But I won't let you get away so soon

Crush me up I'm your amphetimine
I'll keep you up so you cannot dream
Start with me I am your gateway drug
Turn to me when you don't feel loved

Listen once and you can't turn me off

Bloodshot eyes don't tell the truth
Abandoned drives lead to abuse
But I won't let you get away so soon

Roll the dice you'll either win or lose
Your alibi has gotten me confused
But I won't let you get away so soon

Breathe me in, breathe me in

Swallow me down and listen once
I am your gateway gateway drug
I am your gateway gateway drug
I am your gateway gateway drug

If you open your eyes
I know you'll find yourself in me

Bloodshot eyes don't tell the truth
Abandoned drives lead to abuse
But I won't let you get away so soon

Roll the dice you'll either win or lose
Your alibi has gotten me confused
But I won't let you get away so soon---Lyrics submitted by thomas sands.
