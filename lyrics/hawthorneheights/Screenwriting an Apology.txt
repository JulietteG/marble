She Called Last Night
Still Waiting For A Reply
The Static Contact,
Pulling Us Apart,
Please Hang On Tight
I See You Through The Night

You Have Me Still Because I'm Breathing, 
Although It Has Slowed Down
Please Don't Cry Because I'm Leaving,
I Hope I See You Soon

Exchange The Sunshine For Brown Eyes And Dark Skies,
Replace This Dull Life, With You,
I Know It's Tomorrow, She's Waiting, 
For Something To Feel Alive

(Chorus)
You Know Me, Too Well
She's Sorry I Can Tell
Scene Missing, Fade To Black
Your Acting All This Out Again

Just Wake Me When It's Over
When The Curtains Raise
It's Time To Move On
Exit Now, Credits Rolling The Girl Who Stole My Heart
The One That Got Away

(Chorus)
You Know Me, Too Well
She's Sorry I Can Tell
Scene Missing, Fade To Black
Your Acting All This Out Again

You Have Me Still Because I'm Breathing, 
Although It Has Slowed Down
Please Don't Cry Because I'm Leaving,
I Hope I See You Soon

(Chorus)
You Know Me, Too Well
She's Sorry I Can Tell
Scene Missing, Fade To Black
Your Acting All This Out Again---Lyrics submitted by Aron.
