In my arms you lie
You're sleeping and your still
Im wide awake because i cant take it
and this is how i feel

set my mind at ease (set my mind at ease)
im worried and im sad (im worried and im sad)
my front door isnt home anymore
i'll be living with regret

so listen up
and just let the music play
if you listen hard enough
you can hear me say

this is the sound 
of desperation
this is the sound 
of me wearing thin

this is the sound
of desperation (desperation)
this is the sound
of me wearing thin

you've hear it all before
now you'll hear it all again
i never said i would rather be dead
but i've thought about the end (thought about the end)

as soon as its starting over and over
and the nights keep blending in
the only way i can get through the day
is to try to make ammends

so listen up
and just let the music play
if you listen hard enough (listen hard enough)
you can hear me say (hear me say)

this is the sound 
of desperation (desperation)
this is the sound 
of me wearing thin

this is the sound
of desperation (desperation)
this is the sound
of me wearing thin

(wearing thin, wearing thin, this is the sound)

so listen up
and just let the music play
if you listen hard enough
you can hear me say

this is the sound 
of desperation (desperation)
this is the sound 
of me wearing thin

this is the sound
of desperation (desperation)
this is the sound
of me wearing thin (wearing thin)

this is the sound 
of desperation
this is the sound 
of me wearing thin---Lyrics submitted by Alesha.
