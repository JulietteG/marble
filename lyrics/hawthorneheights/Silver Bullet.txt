Tonight, we fly away so high.
Our first full moon sky.

I'll breathe you in,
I won't let you down,
I won't hold you back,
I won't make a sound.

I know what scares you the most.

Being Alone,
Just like them,
Being Alive,
Feeling so... DEAD.

At least you'll have my... HEART.
You know you shine so bright.

Got a single Silver Bullet
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can't survive,
Without you.
Got a single Silver Bullet,
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can't survive,
Without you.

Can you sleep at night,
If I hold you tight.
I won't let you go,
This feels so right.

Please don't leave this... TIME.

At least you'll have my... HEART.
You know you shine so bright.

Got a single Silver Bullet
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can't survive,
Without you.
Got a single Silver Bullet,
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can't survive,
Without you.

Tonight, we fly away so high,
Tonight, We fly away.
You know the moon is full and,
I can't live without you.

Tonight we'll fly away
(Got a single silver bullet, shot right through my heart)
Tonight we'll fly, tonight...

Got a single Silver Bullet
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can't survive,
Without you.
Got a single Silver Bullet,
Shot right through my heart.
To prove I can't survive.

Got a single Silver Bullet
(Tonight we'll fly away so high)
Shot right through my heart.
(Our first full moon sky)
To prove I can't survive,
Without you.

Got a single Silver Bullet,
(Tonight we'll fly away so high)
Shot right through my heart.
(Our first full moon sky.)
To prove I can't survive,
Without you.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
