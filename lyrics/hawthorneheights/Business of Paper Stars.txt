Don't hesitate to remember everything
From this never ending drama monolouge 
Don't leave your hate in surrender
Try to save all the friends that you have lost

Save yourself 
From everything that you have learned
Save yourself 
From all the trust you never earned

We will all learn from the burning alley
We will all learn from the liar's mouth
Save yourself from everything
You have learned

It's easy to forget
Where you are and where you've been
So far in this business of 
Inconsistent paper stars

So let us die or let us live
If you want more, there's none to give
So just stop asking for the right
Betrayed us all if we tried tonight

Save yourself 
From everything that you have learned
Save yourself
From all the trust you never earned

We will all learn from the burning alley
We will all learn from the liar's mouth
Save yourself from everything
You have learned
(You have learned)
(You have learned)

Ahh.
Ahh.

It's easy to forget who you are 
In this business of 
These paper stars

It's easy to forget who you are
In this business of
These paper stars

It's easy to forget who you are 
In this business of
These paper stars

It's easy to forget who you are
In this business of 
These paper stars---Lyrics submitted by Meghan.
