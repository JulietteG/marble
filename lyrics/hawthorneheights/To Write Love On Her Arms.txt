She`s upset, bad day 
Heads for the dresser drawer to drive the pain away
Nothing good can come of this
She opens it there`s nothing there, it`s only left over tears
Mom and Dad have no right, she screams, anger runs down both of her cheeks
And then she closed her eyes and found relief in a knife
But with closed eyes, she cries

All alone the way she feels
Left alone to deal with, all the pain drenched sorrow relief
Bite the lip just forget the bleeding
And then she closed her eyes and found relief in a knife
But with closed eyes, she cries
Woah, oh

And then she closed her eyes and found relief in a knife
But with closed eyes she cries
Ooooh, oh

Curled up, she`s on the floor, relief left her she had hoped for something more from it
Hoped for something for from it
He leans down to comfort her
She is weeping as he wraps his arms around, and around, and 
The deeper you cut, the deeper hurt
The deeper you cut, it only gets worse
The deeper you cut, the deeper I hurt
The deeper you cut, it only gets worse

Gets worse
But she`s slowly opening
She`s slowly opening
New eyes
Then she opened her eyes
Found relief in his life
And put down her knives
Woah, ohh
Then she opened her life
Found relief through his eyes
And put down 
She put down, her knife---Lyrics submitted by Diana Huynh.
