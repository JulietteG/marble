There's a girl next door
she's got holes in both sides of her heart.
She's been crying while lying in the dark
But I think I can save her.
Oh, I think I can save her.

There's a girl next door 
She's got cuts up both sides of her arms
she likes the pain cause the pain don't break her heart
but I think I can save her
oh I think I can save her.

If I leave, will you follow 
me; out of the hallows,
if our empty hearts collide, we can fill them up tonight.  
Oh, hollow hearts unite.

There's a girl next door
her daddy lost his job and now he drinks too much.
her momma left a year ago when daddy got too tough
but I think I can save her
oh I think I can save her.

If I leave, will you follow
me; out of the hallows
If our empty hearts collide, we can fill them up tonight.  
Oh, hollow hearts unite.---Lyrics submitted by Cody Peterson.
