The distance and my  
heart's to sand
flowing through the hourglass

Time to let go of all we know 
and break our hearts in stride
I need you now more like yesterday,
the last day I could see you smile

For the last time 
Turn out the lights my life on standby
So standby and 
watch this fall away and fall apart

Just say that it's over
It's over and she's gone 
(NOW . . . SHE'S . . . GONE)

Don't worry he said
and she's not coming home
(SHE'S . . . NOT . . . COMING . . . HOME)

It's over and she's gone

The distance and my 
heart's to sand 
flowing through the hourglass

I fall to pieces 
I can't let go of all the times 
I never said goodbye

Just say that it's over
It's over and she's gone
(NOW . . . SHE'S . . . GONE)

Don't worry he said
and she's not coming home
(SHE'S . . . NOT . . . COMING . . . HOME)
It's over and she's gone

WAKE UP!
WAKE UP!
WAKE UP!

(WAKE UP!) wake up 
now it's over
(WAKE UP!) just tell 
me it's ok to die

Wake up now it's over . . . 
just tell me it's ok to die . . .
Wake up now it's over . . . 
just tell me it's ok to die . . .---
