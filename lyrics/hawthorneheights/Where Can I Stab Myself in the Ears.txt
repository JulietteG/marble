I guess I could have sent a letter from the road,
with words that always meant more than updates on the phone.
The signal's fading fast and the ink is running out.
The words look good in pen, but sound better from my mouth.

Please hold me tightly, I don't care if I can breathe tonight.
Forget these lungs, their jealousy
I'm burning out, but I can't leave this all behind (leave this all behind)
Leave this all behind (leave this all behind)
Forget these lungs, their jealousy
I'm burning out, but I can't leave this all behind

Behind your back, talking like knives
And I can hardly breathe.
Sharpen your tongue the rest of your life,
like I cannot believe anything that you say.

Please hold me tightly, I don't care if I can breathe tonight.
Forget these lungs, their jealousy
I'm burning out, but I can't leave this all behind (leave this all behind)
Leave this all behind (leave this all behind)
Forget these lungs, their jealousy
I'm burning out, but I can't leave this all behind

So you're the fire and I'm the water.
I am the balance and you are the color.
I won't forget you when we're not together.
This is the ending, here's my surrender.

So you're the fire, I am the water.
I am the balance, you are the color.
I won't forget you when we're not together.
This is the ending, here's my surrender.

Please hold me tightly, I don't care if I can breathe tonight.
Forget these lungs, their jealousy
I'm burning out, but I can't leave this all behind (leave this all behind)
Leave this all behind (leave this all behind)
Forget these lungs, their jealousy
I'm burning out, but I can't leave ---Lyrics submitted by nadia.
