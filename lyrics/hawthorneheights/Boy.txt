One sad and lonely boy
who could not fill the void
in his hollow and empty chest
his head is such a mess
she can never find the time
to try and clear his mind
it's as cloudy as the sky
without a ray of light

he never thought she said "I love you like a son"
I know your father's gone and the damage has been done

tonight, never let me hold you tight
never got to say goodbye
on our one and only, one and only night

every time he cried
he held it deep inside
so no one would ever know
the boy felt so alone
he can never find the time
to untie all the lies
she's worried about herself
he's crying out for help

he never thought she said "I love you like a son"
I know your father's gone and the damage has been done

tonight, never let me hold you tight
never got to say goodbye
on our one and only, one and only night
never let me hold you tight
never got to say goodbye
on our one and only, one and only night

heart of gold with a soul to match
I never thought anything could hold me back
I'm waiting, I'm always waiting
I packed my bags, and never looked back
I didn't know this would be the last I saw you
I never called you
I packed my bags, and never looked back
I didn't know this would be the last I saw you
I never called you

tonight, never let me hold you tight
never got to say goodbye
on our one and only, one and only night
never let me hold you tight
never got to say goodbye
on our one and only, one and only
night ---Lyrics submitted by nadia.
