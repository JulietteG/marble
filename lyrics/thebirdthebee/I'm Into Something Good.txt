Woke up this morning feeling fine
There's something special on my mind
Last night I met a new boy in the neighborhood
Oh yeah, something tells I'm into something good

He's the kind of boy who's not too shy
And I can't help but tell him he's my guy
He danced close to me like I hoped he would
Something tells me I'm into something good

We only danced for a minute or two
But then be stuck close to me the whole night through
Can I be falling in love?
He's everything I've been dreaming of

He walked me home and he held my hand
I knew it couldn't just a one night stand
And he asked to see me next week
And I told him I could

Something tells me I'm into something good
Something tells me I'm into something good

He walked me home and he held my hand
I knew it couldn't just a one night stand
And he asked to see me next week
And I told him I could

Something tells me I'm into something good
Something tells me I'm into something good
Something tells me I'm into something good
Something tells me I'm into something good---
