My songs are good.
My voice is strong.
I've never been alone before...
So,
How am I doing?
How am I doing?
How am I Doing?
The road is long.
The road is tough.
I didn't think I'd have to work this hard...
So,
How am I doing?
How am I doing?
How am I doing?
As I stand, 
Here on,
My own two feet.
As I look,
At how,
Are my friends so sweet.
Like you,
And You,
And you, 
And you,
Like you,
And you.
You.
So, 
How am I doing?
How am I doing?
How am I doing?---Lyrics submitted by Lindsey.
