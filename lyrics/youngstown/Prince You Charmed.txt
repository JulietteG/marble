i've heard time and time again
how all things fall apart
how nothing lasts forever 
well they're wrong
cause through the thick and thin
and the nights that seem so long
you were there without a worry 
you stood strong

chorus

you've got the key to my heart
right here in my arms i'll keep you safe and warm
and you'll never have to worry
never want for nothin'
cause i, 
i'm the prince you charmed

it seems so long ago
when my world was upside down
when my life was filled with tears 
and the skies were gray
but then you came around
i never felt love so profound
i never knew that happiness could feel this way
you got the key babe

chorus x2

i'll shout it out to the heavens
thank god for your love
all the things that you do

chorus x2---Lyrics submitted by virginia.
