We shared the summer we go down to Cancun
No money makes that kind of hard to do
Forget the beach Id rather be here with you playing Croquet okay thats not true

But you make it easy easy
Easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drink beer all day

Yeah you make it easy easy
Easy the rain away
Baby lets stay home

Well put on bug spray and lose our clothes
Put out the lawn chair and turn on the hose
Well play Jack Johnson hes the new Don Ho
And well go surfin surfin surf the radio

You make it easy easy
Easy to get away
Sit in the sun and drinking beer all day

Yeah you make it easy easy
Easy the rain away
Baby [?] Mexico

Dream margaritas and take in the sunset
Later on slip into our king size bed
and make love oh sweet love

You make it easy easy
You make it easy easy

Hey
You make it easy easy
Easy to get away
Sit in the sun and sip tequila all day

Yeah you make it easy easy
Easy the rain away
Baby [?] Mexico
Who needs Mexico
Lets stay home
Baby lets stay home
Lets do it baby
Oh oh
Lets do it baby

A little holiday ---
