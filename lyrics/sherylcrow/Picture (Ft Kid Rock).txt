[Kid Rock]
Livin' my life in a slow hell 
Different girl every night at the hotel 
I ain't seen the sun shine in 3 damn days 
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whisky 
Wish I had a good girl to miss me 
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways 
I put your picture away 
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to her 
I put your picture away, sat down and cried today 
I can't look at you, while I'm lyin next to her

[Sheryl Crow]
I called you last night in the hotel 
Everyone knows but they wont tell 
But their half hearted smiles tell me 
Somethin' just ain't right 
I been waitin' on you for a long time 
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine 
I ain't heard from you in 3 damn nights 
I put your picture away 
I wonder where you been 
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him 
I put your picture away 
I wonder where you been 
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him 
I saw ya yesterday with an old friend 

[Kid Rock]
It was the same ole same "how have you been" 

[Both]
Since you been gone my worlds been dark & grey 

[Kid Rock]
You reminded me of brighter days 

[Sheryl Crow]
I hoped you were comin' home to stay 
I was headed to church

[Kid Rock]
I was off to drink you away 

[Both]
I thought about you for a long time 
Can't seem to get you off my mind 
I can't understand why we're living life this way
I found your picture today 
I swear I'll change my ways 
I just called to say I want you to come back home 
I found your picture today 
I swear I'll change my ways 
I just called to say I want you to come back home 
I just called to say, I love you come back home---Lyrics submitted by Karisten Royal.
