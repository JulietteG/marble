The bags are packed
No more to say
Nobody thought it would end this way
But once the trust is gone, it won't return
Love is built, on give and take
But how things change with one mistake
The hard way is the only way, he'll learn

You don't mess with the girls out here
It's a wide and crazy chick frontier
We tell it straight
Don't take a backwards step, from anyone
We're graduates at heart not school
Button beer flows like rocket fuel
Say it loud and clear
You don't mess with the girls out here

We're not your adverage beauty queen
You won't find us in magazines
Those movie stars don't know how much they miss
When on out, to change the world
We're just hard living country girls
If you don't like that, you know what you can kiss

You don't mess with the girls out here
It's a wide and crazy chick frontier
We tell it straight
Don't take a backwards step, from anyone
We're graduates of heart not school
Button beer flows like rocket fuel
Say it loud and clear
You don't mess with the girls out here

Well we don't try, to pick on men
But they haven't learned since time began
There's only a few things they're good for
You don't give a second chance
If he's no good, throw him his pants
And kick his sorry ass right out the door

You don't mess with the girls out here
It's a wide and crazy chick frontier
We tell it straight
Don't take a backwards step, from anyone
We're graduates of heart not school
Button beer flows like rocket fuel
Say it loud and clear
You don't mess with the girls out here

You don't mess with the girls out here
It's a wide and crazy chick frontier
We tell it straight
Don't take a backwards step, from anyone
We're graduates of heart not school
Button beer flows like rocket fuel
Say it loud and clear
You don't mess with the girls 
Don't mess with the girls out here---Lyrics submitted by Ashleigh Johns.
