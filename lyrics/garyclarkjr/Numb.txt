Well, I'm numb 
Yeah, woman I can't feel a thing
Well, I'm numb
Yeah, woman I can't feel a thing

She give me a hard time in the day
A hard time at night
She can be so sweet
Till she wanna fuss and fight

Till I'm numb
Yeah, woman I can't feel a thing
Well, I'm numb
Yeah, woman I can't feel a thing

Ain't passin' from the right
I ain't passin' to the left
Burn this whole thing down
I'll ride myself

Till I'm numb
Yeah, woman I can't feel a thing
Till I'm numb
Yeah, woman I can't feel a thing

Well, I'm numb
Yeah, woman I can't feel a thing
Well, I'm numb
Yeah, woman I can't feel a thing---Lyrics submitted by Mark Sporle.
