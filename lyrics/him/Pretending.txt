Love is a flame that
Can be tamed
And though we are It's willing 
prey, My darling
We are not the
Ones to blame

Trust is a word
All lovers know
The glorious Art Of staining 
Souls, My Darling
We are not the 
Ones to blame

The more we have
The more we want
And the more it hurts Our 
hearts, my baby
It always ends up
In tears, 

so keep On 
pretending Our
Heavens worth the
Waiting, Keep on
Pretending it's
Alright, 

So keep on 
Pretending It 
Will be the end 
Of our craving Keep 
On pretending it's
Alright

When doubts arise
The game begins
The one we will
Never win, my baby
It always ends up
In tears,

So keep on
Pretending our
Heavens worth our
waiting, keep on
Pretending it's
Alright

So keep on 
Pretending It
Will be the end
Of our craving Keep 
On pretending it's
Alright....

...So keep on 
Pretending our 
Heavens worth our
Waiting, keep on 
Pretending it's 
Alright

So keep on
Pretending it
Will be the end
Of our craving keep
On pretending it's
Alright...

Love is a flame that
Can be tamed
And though we are It's willing 
prey, My darling
We are not the
Ones to blame---Lyrics submitted by Desiree.
