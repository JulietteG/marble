For a moment the world turned it's back,and you let me come closer,both our hearts we're filled with fear,from this dark secret love,I'll let the world turn it's back,and please let me come closer,both our hearts are filled with fear from this love.

Our six six six has gone away,we beg in his face again and again,for it is our dark secret love.
(I love you x6)

For a moment the world turn it's back,and you let me come closer,both our hearts grows with fury.

our six six six has gone away,we beg in his face again and again,for it is our dark secret love,and our six six six has gone away,we beg in his face again and again,for it is our dark secret love,---Lyrics submitted by Tabitha.
