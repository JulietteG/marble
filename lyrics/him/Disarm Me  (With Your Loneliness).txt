The promise of heaven
pushed us right back to hell
Turn three sevens
into three sixes again

And you laughed at my face
when I told you how much it hurts
and said

Disarm me with your loneliness
just like always before
And deceive me out of my emptiness
telling me how you love

You keep on tempting me
to go on whatever the cost
To witness the prettiest flower
in bloom wither to dust

So I'll break all the rules in this endless game
once called love, for you

Disarm me with your loneliness
just like always before
And deceive me out of my emptiness
telling me how you love
me with all your heart, no more

Disarm me with your loneliness
just like always before

Disarm me with your loneliness
just like always before
And deceive me out of my emptiness
telling me how you love
me with all your heart, no more

(Tell me how much it hurts, my warmth)
no more
(Tell me how my kiss can change your world)
no more
(Tell me how much it hurts to be alone)
no more
(Lie to me that you love me with all your heart)
no more---Lyrics submitted by Brad.
