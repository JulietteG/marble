You missed the winter and it followed you back home
Where sun kissed the crimson footsteps in the melting snow
We are doing our best to disown the golden mean
By these acts of cruelty in the name of beauty to be free

The acoustic funeral for love in limbo
We're dancing with tags on our toes
I save my last breath for your window
To write you this song, for the acoustic funeral

On the verge of a vow to kill all reason
Locking that door to a nightmare within a nightmare
We are bound to adore
Let the planchette in the shape of a heart glide to oui
And finally confirm all fears to be so real
(Be so real)

The acoustic funeral for love in limbo
We're dancing with tags on our toes
I save my last breath for your window
To write you this song, for the acoustic funeral

Underneath the ice so thin I am turning blue
the one last thing I know to be real is the shadow of you
killing love with a kiss

The acoustic funeral for love in limbo
We're dancing with tags on our toes
I save my last breath for your window
To write you this song, for the acoustic funeral
Let's re-enact the fall, for the acoustic funeral 

Killing love with a kiss---Lyrics submitted by Brad.
