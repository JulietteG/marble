Yeah.

Well, let's go back to the day.
When I saw your face for the very first time.

Well let's go back again when I held your hand.
Stare into your eyes.
Cause I knew you were the one.
But my life has just begun.

Baby, you can count on me.

Cause your heart-t-t is in my hand.
Cause your heart-t-t is in my hand.
Oh woah-oh oh oh.
Yeah.

Well let's go back in time on this.
Always knew that you'd be mine.
And I'm never gonna find someone as beautiful as you, girl.

Got my hand right your waist.
Look in your eyes.
Kiss your lips, touch up on your face.

Can't forget the way I see you smile.
Cause I knew you were the one.
With you, my life has just begun.

Baby, you can count on me.

Cause your heart-t-t is in my hand.
Cause your heart-t-t is in my hand.
O-o-oh yeah. ---
