(S-say my name, Say My Name
 Say My Name, Say My Name
 S-say my name, Say My Name
 Say My Name, Say My Name)

 Stop
 I'm starting to think that you're all talk 
 We both know why you're here and what you're waiting for
 Tonight (Yeah)

 Wait
 It's getting kinda late and you should stay
 You're nervous I can tell by looking in your eyes
 It's alright (Yeah)

 (We're talking 'bout it, don't talk about it, no talking 'bout it no more)
 (Let's be about it, we'll get it popping girl, get it started let's go)
 And I'll give you whatever you like (ohhh)

 Say My Name
 Ain't no time to play
 It's not a game
 I feel some type of way
 And I don't want nobody's body baby if its not your body on mine

 Whatcha say 
 Ain't no time to waste
 Another day
 I can never wait 
 'Cause the time is right, there's nothing like when your body is right next to mine 
 Say My Name tonight

 (Say My Name, Say My Name
 Say My Name, Say My Name
 Say My Name, Say My Name
 Say My Name, Say My Name
 Say My Name)

 Oh 
 Baby, cut the lights down low
 And I'm gon' treat ya like you never felt before
 Tonight

 Breathe
 Baby girl, I know you got your needs
 And I'll make it my mission to make sure you're pleased 
 It's on me
 Oh

 (We're talking 'bout it, don't talk about it, no talking 'bout it no more)
 (Let's be about it, we'll get it popping girl, get it started let's go)
 And I'll give you whatever you like (ohhh)

 Say My Name
 Ain't no time to play
 It's not a game
 I feel some type of way
 And I don't want nobody's body baby if its not your body on mine

 Whatcha say 
 Ain't no time to waste
 Another day
 I can never wait 
 'Cause the time is right, there's nothing like when your body is right next to mine 
 Say My Name tonight

 Let me hear you say (Just say my name)
 Hands wrapped around your waist (We're face to face)
 Won't let this moment fade (Won't let it fade no)
 Won't let it fade 
 Just say my name 
 Say my name

 I won't let it go (Won't let it go)
 But let me take control (It's not a race no)
 I'm gon' love you so 
 I love you baby
 I love you baby

 Just say my name (Say my name)

 Say My Name
 Ain't no time to play
 It's not a game
 I feel some type of way
 And I don't want nobody's body baby if its not your body on mine

 Whatcha say 
 Ain't no time to waste
 Another day
 I can never wait 
 'Cause the time is right, there's nothing like when your body is right next to mine 
 Say My Name tonight

 (S-say my name, Say my name
 Say my name, Say my name
 S-say my name, Say my name
 Say my name, Say my name
 Say my name, Say my name
 S-Say my name, Say my name
 Say my name, Say my name
 Say my name, Say my name)---Lyrics submitted by tori williams.
