You walk into the room
So perfect but unaware
Making me stop and stare
Every time I heard he broke your heart
Can I just fix you girl?
Show you a different world?

I'll take you anywhere
I'll put you on a throne
I'll lay down my heart, I swear
And I'll make sure that you'll never be alone

Only my shadow knows
How I feel about you
Only my shadow goes
Where I dream of you and me
Should I go or wait?
Is it too soon, too late?
Only my shadow knows

I've been loving you so long
And now that I got the chance
I see you need to dance on your own
So I'll wait another day
Maybe another year
I'm gonna be right here, oh

I'll take you anywhere
I'll put you on a throne
I'll lay down my heart, I swear
And I'll make sure that you'll never be alone (alone)

Only my shadow knows
How I feel about you
Only my shadow goes
Where I dream of you and me
Should I go or wait?
Is it too soon, too late?
Cause only my shadow knows

I wish I could say all these words
All these things that your heart never heard, yeah
But I saw the pain in your eyes and it sealed my lips

Only my shadow knows
How I feel about you
Only my shadow goes
Where I dream of you and me
Should I go or wait?
Is it too soon, too late?
Only my shadow knows, ey
Only my shadow knows, oh oh

Only my shadow knows ---
