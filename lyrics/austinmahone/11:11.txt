Its 11:11 make a wish and make a wish and say [x2]
Its 11:11 make a wish make a wish and say
I hope you come true
Yeah, 1 2 3 4 soon as you walk through the door
Counting 5 6 7 8 9 one million thoughts quick hit my mind
(have you been running)
Where have you been lately
Ohh, you know it drives me crazy
You know I miss your kiss
Hate to let you see me like this
Because I know when she's on my mind
She's got me all worked up inside
And I know it's going down tonight
Because she's moving and its feelin right
Girl you got me feelin right
And I know that you've been hatin me
Let the things I say be history
You can move like that, I can move like this
Girl you know its time to make a wish
Make a wish girl

Its 11:11 make a wish and make a wish and say [x2]
Its 11:11 make a wish make a wish and say
I hope you come true
Its 11:11 make a wish and make a wish and say [x2]
Its 11:11 make a wish make a wish and say
I hope you come true

Yeah 8 7 6 to the 5 I'll be singing your song and I'll sing it all night
Cause 4 3 2 1 I don't wanna be singing alone
You are the perfect melody but now my harmonys feelin outta key
And I just wanna feel your love again (I wanna feel love)
Why don't you say that we're more than friends
Because I know that when she's on my mind
She's got me all worked up inside
And I know it's going down tonight
Because she's moving and its feelin right
Girl you got me feeling right
And I know that you've been hating me
Let the things I say be history
You can move like that, I can move like this
Girl you know its time to make a wish
Make a wish girl

Its 11:11 make a wish make a wish and say [x3]
I hope you come true

Because your everything I'm looking for
I know cause I'm not looking anymore
And I'm so lucky with the love I found
Make a wish so tomorrow comes around

Its 11:11 make a wish and make a wish and say [x2]
Its 11:11 make a wish make a wish and say
I hope you come true
Its 11:11 make a wish and make a wish and say [x2]
Its 11:11 make a wish make a wish and say
I hope you come true
Its 11:11 make a wish and make a wish and say [x2]
Its 11:11 make a wish make a wish and say
I hope you come true

And I'm so lucky with the love I found, love I found, lolove I found [x2]---Lyrics submitted by Haley Key.
