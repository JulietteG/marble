Don't the water grow the trees?
Don't the moon pull the tide?
Don't the stars light the sky?
Like you need to light my life?

If you need me anytime
You know I'm always right by your side!
See, I've never felt this love
You're the only thing that's on my mind

You don't understand how much you really mean to me
I need you in my life
You're my necessity
But believe me you're everything
That just makes my world complete
My love is clear, the only thing that I love

You're all I ever need, baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me
You're all I ever need, baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me

Don't the water grow the trees?
Don't the moon pull the tide?
Don't the stars light the sky?
Like you need to light my life!

We can do anything you like
I know we both can get it right tonight
You got your walls built up high
I can tell by looking in your eyes

You don't understand how much you really mean to me
I need you in my life
You're my necessity
But believe me you're everything
That just makes my world complete
My love is clear, the only thing that I love

You're all I ever need, baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me
You're all I ever need, baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me

When it comes to you
Baby I'm addicted
You're like a drug, no rehab can fix it
I think you're perfect baby, even with your flaws
You ask what I like about you
Ooh, I love it all
When it comes to you
Baby I'm addicted
You're like a drug, no rehab can fix it
I think you're perfect even with your flaws
You ask what I like about you
Oh, I love it all

You're all I ever need, baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me
You're all I ever need, baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me---Lyrics submitted by Alicia Maria.
