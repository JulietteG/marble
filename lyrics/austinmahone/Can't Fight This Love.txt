Can't fight this love

I've been hit by a train
It came out of the blue
What a beautiful pain
When I fell so hard for you
I just can't look away
When you walk in the room
There's no way to escape
There's only one thing I can do

Don't let it take control
There's no way I'll let you go
And the one thing that I know

Can't fight this love
Can't fight this energy
It's natural
It's taking over me
Can't fight this love
Flowing straight through my veins
Can't fight this love
Can't fight this, can't fight this
Can't fight this love

I don't know what it is
I'm down on my knees
I've been trying to resist
I can't take it anymore
It gets harder to breathe
Girl I'm hooked for sure
I can't hide what I feel
Cause you opened every door

Don't let it take control
There's no way I'll let you go
And the one thing that I know

Can't fight this love
Can't fight this energy
It's natural
It's taking over me
Can't fight this love
Flowing straight through my veins
Can't fight this love
Can't fight this, can't fight this
Can't fight this love

It took one look
And it was all over
One smile, and I was lost
You broke through my defenses
So I'm yours

Can't fight this love, yeah
Can't fight this love, oh
Can't fight this love, yeah yeah
Can't fight this love

Can't fight this love
Can't fight this energy
It's natural
It's taking over me
Can't fight this love
Flowing straight through my veins
Can't fight this love
Can't fight this, can't fight this
Can't fight this love ---
