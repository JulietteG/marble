Every time I think about a zero,
It's me with my eyes X'ed out with a Sharpie
And if I'm gonna try to keep it near though
There's only two dimensions to this rainbow

Its not me its a hologram (x4)
I get my information form of two,
I'm living on the station without you
You ask me for dimensions, I got two
I am a hologram

Everytime the curtains part a little
Your face comes out then like a frame, like a video game
Your bones are creaking like a fiddle
But in the end its only gonna be myself to blame

Its not me its a hologram (x4)
I get my information form of two,
I'm living on the station without you
You ask me for dimensions, I got two
I am a hologram (x5)---Lyrics submitted by M.
