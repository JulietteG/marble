I don't need explanations
In the end. baby we, are locked in
We're on the same page
You're never too soft for me
The super things, me and her
Everything ain't got to be tough
Can't stop us, we're supposed to be together
So go ahead and talk a little jaw
I know she fight for me, just like family
She give her right hand to me, to face the family
She still stands with me

Don't matter what nobody say, about the things I do for you
Tell your brother and your mama and them, how I feel for you
Don't matter what nobody say, about the things I do for you
Don't matter, don't matter what they say
Don't matter what they say about the things I do for you

Girl, we, what we got is really unbreakable
Any questions about your worth
I tell them I paid in full
I'm bent up on the highway was traveling long ago
Anybody asking about my girl, and I tell them my girls a gold

Oh, I know she fight for me
'Cause like family, give her right hand for me
Whenever the drama isn't right for me

Don't matter what nobody say, about the things I do for you
Tell your brother and your mama and them, how I feel for you
Don't matter what nobody say, about the things I do for you
Don't matter, don't matter what they say
Don't matter what they say about the things I do for you

Everybody has a mouth, everybody has something to say
If they feeling me and you, tell them don't even walk this way
Ain't worry about the words I believe in
You and me, we were meant to be
I know that it might get hard, but we stay anyway

Oh, I know she fight for me
Because like family, she give her right hand to me
Whatever the problem is, always stands with me

Don't matter what nobody say, about the things I do for you
Tell your brother and your mama and them, how I feel for you
Don't matter what nobody say, about the things I do for you
Don't matter, don't matter what they say
Don't matter what they say about the things I do for you---
