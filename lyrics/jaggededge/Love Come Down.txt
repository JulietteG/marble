Why cant I control my hands, love?
'Cause every time that Im around you, girl
My body go open madness
It's like it's got a mind all of it's own
Baby, excuse my madness
I dont know that you make me see like I'm an animal

I need what you got, I see where's your spot
Feel free on your time
Dont you wanna get em and make love come down
Love come down
Love come down

I need what you got, I see where youre spot
You and me in the back
Ill do what it get till make love come down
Love come down
Love come down

When your love come down
Ill be looking like crazy
When your love come down
Im like I told you so baby
When your love come down
When your love come down

Girl, when your love come down
And your body get you shaking
When your love come down
Hey pause get you braking
Your love come down
Your love come down

I need what you got, I see where youre spot
You and me in the back
Ill do what it get till make love come down
Love come down
Love come down yeah yeah

If these walls they could talk in this room
They speak all love and passion
All before your love come down
Your love come down
Make your love come down

I need what you got, I see where youre spot
You and me in the back
Ill do what it get till make love come down
Love come down
Love come down yeah yeah

I need what you got, I see where youre spot
You and me in the back
Ill do what it get till make love come down
Love come down
Love come down yeah yeah---
