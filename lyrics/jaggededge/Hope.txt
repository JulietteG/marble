Man, I've been playing around these streets so long 
I know my girl think that I'd never be ready 
But I'mma do all I can to let her know I'm ready 
'Cause really, she is worth it! 

From now on I'm takin' all it costs 
From now on we won't get lost at all 
My time is running out, I know 
And now I'm tryina restore her hope in me, 
It's clear for me, somebody had hurt her 
I just wanna be the one who stands between 
Anyone who don't do her right 
I'd be there like there tonight 
Tryina make this girl see the light 

I hope that she sees the love when she sees me 
I hope that she sees all this love I'm filled with 
All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is 
Came up with this little plan, 
Put her hope back in me! 
I hope that sure she sees the love when she sees me 
I hope that she sees all this love that we should be 
All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is 
Came up with this little plan, 
Put her hope back in me! 

I see her pain deep within her face 
She yells out Lemme put him back in this place 
Don't tryina bone dawg, with this girl I know 
That is a gain back to put her hope in me 
'Bout a time they will be like everyday 
And birthdays will came around like everyday 
Now I'm starting to built her a home, start to built a home 
I just hope she sees me. 

I hope that she sees the love when she sees me 
I hope that she sees all this love I'm filled with 
All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is 
Came up with this little plan, 
Put her hope back in me! 
I hope that sure she sees the love when she sees me 
I hope that she sees all this love that we should be 
All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is 
Came up with this little plan, 
Put her hope back in me! 

Tryina love you better than you've ever been loved 
Tryina touch you the way you've never been touched 
When it keeps on sexin' you know I'm only turning you up 
To a place you've never been, girl! 

Hope that she see his love now 
Hope that she see all this love 
Hope that she see his love now 
Hope that she see all this love 

I hope that she sees the love when she sees me 
I hope that she sees all this love I'm filled with 
All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is 
Came up with this little plan, 
Put her hope back in me! 
I hope that sure she sees the love when she sees me 
I hope that she sees all this love that we should be 
All I wanna do is, all I wanna do is 
Came up with this little plan, 
Put her hope back in me!---
