Girl if you want love 
And you need it now girl
I'm the one you call
Name on the speed dial girl
Want love 
Dont look no further 
You always watchin me
And never hit the curb girl
I see when you come
And you want that real sh-
Same place you come 
When you want one real quick
Oh uh uh oh uh uh oh
You know thats how it go, thats how it go

You're my love angel
Swooping down on me
Keep you in my life just to whip that thing on me
Then so, shawty I know (shawty I know)
And you no no no noooooo

[Chorus]
When you need someone to love on
I'm the one you call on
When you need someone to love on, girl
When you need someone to hold on
I'm the one you hold one 
When you need someone to love on, girl
When you need someone to love on
I'm the one you love on
When you need someone to love on, girl
When you need someone to rub on
Touch you and love on
I'm the one you love on girl
I'm the one you love on [x2]
I'm the one you love on girl
I'm the one you love on [x2]
I'm the one you love on girl


My car cream, my wheels mean
Just cause I know you love it when I'm ridin clean
Got big dreams, she fit right in
She single lady, waste no time just gettin' in
And my lover (sooo) 
And I'll be right there when she need just a hug of some love
Your family knowss, that you're in good hands with this man and
Here's where I make a standing

You're my love angel
Swooping down on me
Keep you in my life just to whip that thing on me
Then so, shawty I know (shawty I know)
And this my chance to really let you no, no baby

[Chorus]


You'll never have to wonder where the love went (love went)
If you need it girl I'm like an automatic button
We're going somewhere we can have fun in the sun and
Been goin' at it two weeks girl, thats really somethin
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I know it might sound cheesy, but girl you complete me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah that's how you're making me looovee
