Well, goin' see my long hair...
Well, goin' see my long hair...
Well goin' tell her 'bout my trouble

Well, goin' get up early in the...
Well, goin' get up early in the...
Well goin' see my long hair Doney

Well, my trouble soon'll be...
Well, my trouble soon'll be...
Well my trouble soon be over

Trouble will make you sad fo' yo'...
Trouble will make you sad fo' yo'...
Trouble will make you sad fo' yo' Mama---Lyrics submitted by Juba.
