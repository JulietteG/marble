There's a front row scarecrow pickin' through Hogan's crops
There's a Trans-Am cute thing taking off her t-tops
There's a whole lot of honeys and they make a sweet backdrop
To a sunset banjo tunin' up to rock

Hey baby, wanna make a little music
Pull out your twang and show me how you use it
(Oh-oh-oh)
C'mon

Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
It'll do you good to let loose a little
Let me hear you scream right there in the middle
(Oh-oh-oh)
Holler if you're with me

We're all free-fallin' in this field of country love
It's a head-bobbin' hand waving' sea of solo cups
Sweat drops rollin' off, mixin' in the moonshine mud
From all of the bumping and grinding, I just can't' get enough
Oh, can't you get enough?

Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
It'll do you good to let loose a little
Let me hear you scream right there in the middle
(Oh-oh-oh)
Holler if you're with me

Holler if you're with me
I said, holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me, c'mon
Holler if you're with me

Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
It'll do you good to let loose a little
Let me hear you scream right there in the middle
(Oh-oh-oh)
Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me
Holler if you're with me

Holler if you're with me---
