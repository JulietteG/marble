As much as I love the sunshine
Looking at the world through a pair of ray bans
As much as I love a blue sky
The wind in my face with that top down feeling
It dont compare to this
So if the sun never came back up again Id be alright with it

Cause the drinks get stronger
The music gets louder
The dresses get shorter
Oh my, oh my
Stars catch fire
We keep getting higher
And everybodys feeling
Alright, alright
You get that drive me crazy come and get me baby look in your eye
Yeah the days just better at night

Yeah, The mood gets a little bit looser
When the buzz kicks in and the moon takes over
And life gets that much sweeter, just like your kiss
Oh, baby come a little closer
Tomorrow we can sleep, however long til the headaches gone
Yeah, we aint gonna miss a thing

As much as I love the sunshine
And lookin at the world through a pair of Ray-bans

Cause the drinks get stronger
The music gets louder
The dresses get shorter
Oh my, oh my
Stars catch fire
We keep getting higher
And everybodys feeling
Alright, alright
Yeah, the hip gets hoppin
The country gets rockin, pop gets poppin
You get that drive me crazy come and get me baby look in your eye
Yeah the days just better at night

Yeah, the days just better at night
Yeah, the days just better at night---
