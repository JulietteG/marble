It can make you cry, it can make you laugh
Give you feelings that you've never had
Make the worst of times just fade away
Help you find the words that you don't know how to say

The power of a love song
Can make you believe
The power of a love song
It can change everything
It can right every wrong, help you hold on
Even when all hope is gone

It can take you back to that first time
When you both looked in each other's eyes
You say I do, then take her hand
Slowly start to sway for that first dance

The power of a love song
Can make you believe
The power of a love song
It can change everything
It can right every wrong, help you hold on
Even when all hope is gone
The power of a love song

The power of a love song
Can make you believe
The power of a love song
It can change everything
It can right every wrong, help you hold on
Even when all hope is gone

It's the power of a love song

It can make you cry, it can make you laugh
Give you feelings that you've never had---
