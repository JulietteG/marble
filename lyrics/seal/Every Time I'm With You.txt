Are we going insane?
Do we need to explain?
I feel like we know it
Am I doing it right?
Cause when you show me that candlelight
I don't wanna blow it

Coming in, let me know if you like it
Show me you like it, show me excited

I can lose it all, it won't be daunting
Somehow I don't think I'd even care
Cause every time I'm with you, I feel wanted
We could make believers if we dare, yeah

There is so much at stake
Hearts too soft to break
But we don't need to go there
Cause we're like summer and rain
You and I are not the same
That's what makes it perfect

Coming in, let me know if you like it
Show me you like it, show me excited

I can lose it all, it won't be daunting
Somehow I don't think I'd even care
Cause every time I'm with you, I feel wanted
We could make believers if we dare, yeah

Coming out, show me you like it
Show me you like it
Coming out, show me you like it
Show me you like it

I can lose it all, it won't be daunting
Somehow I don't think I'd even care
Cause every time I'm with you, I feel wanted
We could make believers if we dare, yeah
We're just two believers if we dare, yeah

Coming out, show me you like it
Show me you like it
Coming out, show me you like it
Show me you like it---
