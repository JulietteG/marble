Hmmmmmmmmmmmm
I,
I am
So unsure
Every minute that waits
Every second that I'm away
From you
And love
Is a way that
Has no rules
Know that I'm loving you
Even if it's
A fool that waits in vain
Waits in vain
Yesterday it hit me
I felt we were slipping away
Say you if you can it's okay
Just like you said way then
Sometimes I fall
And I feel like
I don't know the way
Say if you can it's okay
Just like you said then
Just like you said
Now
Now my days become long
Okay
I know I'll never feel the same again
So please
Don't let
My lows bring you down
Always know that
I need you
Yes I do....oh
Yesterday it hit me
I felt we were slipping away
Say if you can
It's okay
Just like you said way then
Sometimes I fall and I feel like
I don't know the way
Won't you say if you can
It's okay
Just like you said then
Just like you said.... oh
Ohhhhhh .....
My my my my my again
Yesterday it hit me
I felt you were slipping
Away
Say if if you can it's okay
Just like you said way then
Sometimes I fall and I feel
I don't know the way
Won't you say if you can
it's okay
Just like you said then
Just like you said.... oh
Just like you said then
Just like you said.... oh
Just like you said way back then
Just like you said---Lyrics submitted by Ankica.
