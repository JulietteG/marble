I've been loving you too long 
to stop now 
You're tired and you wanna be free 
My love grows stronger  you become a habit to me 

I've been loving you for too long 
I don't wanna stop now 
with you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now

You're tired and your love is growing cold 
My love is growing stronger as our affair is growing old 
I've been loving you  too long 
To stop now 

I've been loving you just little too long 
To stop now ,no,no,
Please don't make me stop now
No please no

I don't wanna stop now
'cause i lose my mind
please i don't wanna stop now no,no,no
No,'cause i lose my mind,lose my mind..mind..mind..---
