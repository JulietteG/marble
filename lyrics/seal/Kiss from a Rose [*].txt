There used to be
a graying tower
alone on the sea

You became
the light on the
dark side of me

Love remained a
drug that's the high
and not the pill

But did you know,
that when it snows,

My eyes become large
and the light that you shine
can be seen
baby,

I compare you to a
kiss from a rose
on the grave

Ooh,
The more I get of you,
the stranger it feels,
yeah

And now that your
rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom
on the grave

There's so much a
man can tell you,
so much he can say

You remain
my power,
my pleasure,
my pain,
baby

To me you're like a 
growing addiction
that I can't deny

Won't you tell me
is that healthy,
baby

But did you know
that when it snows

My eyes become large
and the light
that you shine
can be seen
baby

I compare you to a
kiss from a rose
on the grave

Ooh,
The more I get of you,
the stranger it feels,
yeah

Now that your
rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom
on the grave

I've been
kissed by a rose
on the grave

I've been
kissed by a rose
on the grave

I've been
kissed by a rose
on the grave

And if i should fall
along the way

I've been
kissed by a rose
on the grave

There's so much a
man can tell you,
so much he can say

You remain
my power,
my pleasure,
my pain,
baby

To me you're like a 
growing addiction
that I can't deny

Won't you tell me
is that healthy,
baby

But did you know
that when it snows

My eyes become large
and the light
that you shine
can be seen
baby

I compare you to a
kiss from a rose
on the grave

Ooh,
The more I get of you,
the stranger it feels,
yeah

Now that your
rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom
on the grave---Lyrics submitted by none.
