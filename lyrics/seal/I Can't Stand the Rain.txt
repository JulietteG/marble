Rain, against my window, sweet memories. 
I cant stand the rain 'gainst my window 
Bringing back sweet memories 
I cant stand the rain against my window 
coz youre not here with me 
Hey, window pain, do you remember 
How sweet it used to be 

When we were together 
Everything was so grand 
now that weve parted 
You know theres one thing 
that I just cant stand 

I cant stand the rain against my window 
Bringing back sweet memories 
I cant stand the rain against my window 
How sweet it used to be. 

'Lone with the pillow 
Where our heads used to lay 
Well, I know youve got some sweet memories 
But like a window you aint 
got nothin' to say 
I cant stand the rain 

I cant stand the rain 
against my window, oh 
bringing back sweet memories 
I cant stand the rain 
against my window, 
coz shes not here with me. 

I cant stand the rain [x3] 
I said, I cant stand the rain 
Oh no, 
I just cant stand the rain, the rain, the rain. 
I cant stand the rain 
I cant stand the rain.---
