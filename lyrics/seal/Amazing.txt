Everyone says youre amazing 

Say you dont know how to do it now 
So you run 
Its not that youre bleeding, but youre through with it now 
So you run, so you run 

I know that you need it, you cant live alone 
So you run, so you run 

Everyone says youre amazing now that youre clean 
Only you know the real ones are cause youve seen 
Theres only one question I want to ask is it here and 
When you hear everyone say youre amazing 
Des anyone ask you? 

Do you cry in your sleep and do you feel ok? 
When you run 

Thinking its Doomsday you got to let it go 
So you run, so you run 

Pretend you dont see it, that we can live a lie 
So you run, so you run 
Everyone says youre amazing now that youre clean 
Only you know the real ones are cause youve seen 
Theres only one question I want to ask is it here and 
When, when you hear everyone say youre amazing 
Des anyone ask you? 

Cause I know that youre real, amazing, amazing, amazing 

Everyone says youre amazing now that youre clean 
Only you know the real ones are cause youve seen 
Theres only one question I want to ask is it here and 
When you. 
Everyone says youre amazing 

Everyone says youre amazing 
(I want you to always feel youre amazing) 
Everyone says youre amazing 
(I want you to always feel youre amazing) 
Everyone says youre amazing 
(I want you to always feel youre amazing) 
(I want you to always feel youre amazing) 

Youre amazing---Lyrics submitted by kate.
