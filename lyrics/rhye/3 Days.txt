OooOooh im famished
So Ill eat your minerals
Grab a beast out of foolish fierce
Ill steal your breath
Twisted thief with a mangled glove
Just my nature of ruined love x2

Stealing kisses in those misses within us??
Stealing kisses in those bloody sheets
Im killing you x2
Stealing kisses in those misses within us
Stealing kisses in those bloody sheets
Im killing you x2

Mmmmmm
Theres a window in time
3 days to feel each other
Crack this vine
Its going to break; cave in on its side
Love is terminal not that it lasts?
Burn bright burn fast x2

Stealing kisses in those misses within us
Stealing kisses in those bloody sheets
Im killing you x2
Stealing kisses in those misses within us
Stealing kisses in those bloody sheets
Im killing you x2

oooh So many ways x2
Go for days to feel each other
Go for days to set aside
Go for days to feel each other
Go for days to set aside
Go for days to feel each other
Go for days to set aside
Go for days to feel each other
Go for days to set aside---Lyrics submitted by agustina.
