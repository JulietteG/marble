One time a man felt like something, working for honest pay
But when you've got nothing, no one gives nothing,
not even the time of day.

Chorus: 
Homeless and hungry: I've done everything that I could
Heart broke and homeless and hungry, I will work for food.

There's her ramshackle shack in the mountains, 
where the bank nailed a note to the door, 
Now I wandered the streets of your city, no home in this world no more

The policeman asked me this morning, to pack up and be on my way
Begging ain't no part of nothing;  guess hard times are here to stay---Lyrics submitted by Tom Sproger.
