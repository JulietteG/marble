It's uncertainty killing me
you're certainly fast asleep
maybe I've gone way too deep
maybe I'm just far too weak
And thats the last place
yeah and thats the last place

and when you forgive our regrets
and when you regret

Thousands are lost, maybe more
the question remains what is this for?
maybe it came unexpected
maybe im left unprotected
oh and thats the last place
yeah thats the last place

and when we forget our regrets
and when we remember our dreams
and when we forget our regrets
and we regret

shes holding on until the last
shes holding on until theres nothing left
shes holding on until the last
shes holding on until theres nothing left---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
