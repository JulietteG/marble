Figure since I'm so far gone, oceans away, I can lay my sabre down today. I miss the words I love the words, you did not say. I miss the kiss you never, never gave away. 
There goes the sun, oceans away 
And days die young when you're gone and you're gone 
There goes the sun, oceans away 
And leaves the day for someone else 
Honestly I thought that we could make it all the way, Barefoot on beaches dancing against the gray. But stone by stone the castle crumbled to the ground, I stood and stared as you started to fall into the waves. 
There goes the sun, oceans away 
And days die young when you're gone and you're gone 
There goes the sun, oceans away 
And leaves the day for someone else 
Here's to the man of your dreams. I take it all in a box and make my way down to the shore, Throw it in and begin to leave it to the waves---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
