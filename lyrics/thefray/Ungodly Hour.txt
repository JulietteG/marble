Don't talk, don't say a thing
Cause your eyes they tell me more than your words
Don't go, don't leave me now
Cause they say the best way out is through

And I am short on words knowing what's occurred
She begins to leave because of me

Her bag is now much heavier
I wish that I could carry her
But this is our ungodly hour

I know you're leaving now
Cause I held on to my way tightly
Stay still until you know
Tomorrow finds the best way out is through

And I am short on words knowing what's occurred
She begins to leave because of me

Her bag is now much heavier
I wish that I could carry her
But this is our ungodly hour

And I am short on words knowing whats occurred
she begins to leave because of me

Her bag is now much heavier 
i wish that i could carry her 
but this is our ungodly hour
ungodly hour
ungodly hour

her bag is now much heavier 
i wish that i could carry her
but this is our ungodly hour
ungodly hour
ungodly hour---Lyrics submitted by hjk.
