She doesn't look, she doesn't see
Opens up for nobody 
Figures out, she figures out

Narrow lines, she can't decide
Everything short of suicide
Never hurts, nearly works

Something's scratching its way out
Something you wanna forget about

A part of you that'll never show
You're the only one that'll ever know
Take it back where it all began
Take your time, would you understand
What it's all about, what it's all about

Something's scratching its way out
Something you wanna forget about
No one expects you to get up
All on your own with no one around

Something's scratching its way out
Something you wanna forget about
No one expects you to get up
All on your own with no one around---Lyrics submitted by Catherine B.
