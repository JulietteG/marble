She's so fierce and full of fire
What's the boy to do?
She doesn't act fumble
She's got the power
She's barely 5 foot 2
She's a hurricane

I see the waves
Crashing the harbor
Just beyond the break
I should run and hide with filters
But I can't look away
She's a hurricane

And I hear thunder

But I won't run, I won't run

I wanna meet her
I wanna see her
Dancing in the street
I wanna feel her
I wanna hold her very close to me

She's a hurricane
Hurricane

Lost in the riot
Peace and quite
End the world in lust
I'll be your cousin
She'll be mine from dust to dust
She's a hurricane

And I hear thunder

But I won't run, I won't run

The sun is rising
The rain is falling
I'd give you all that's left of me

I will run
I will run until your hurricane
I will run,
I will run
I will run,
I will run

You're my hurricane
You're my hurricane

Hurricane

She's a hurricane---
