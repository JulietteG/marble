In the night, I hear 'em talk, 
the coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless... 
How could you be so heartless? 
Oh... How could you be so heartless? 

[Verse 1] 
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo 
Just remember that you talkin' to me though 
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo 
I mean after all the things that we've been through 
I mean after all the things we got into 
Yall know of some things that you ain't told me 
Yall did some things but that's the old me 
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me 
So you walk around like you don't know me 
You got a new friend, well I got homies 
But in the end it's still so lonely 

[Chorus] 
In the night, I hear 'em talk, 
the coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless... 
How could you be so heartless? 
Oh... How could you be so heartless? 

[Verse 2] 
How could you be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I dont know... 
I decided we weren't gon' speak so 
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone 
Why does she be so mad at me fo' 
Homie I dont know, she's hot and cold 
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up 
'Cause I already know how this thing go 
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me 
They say that they don't see what you see in me 
You wait a couple months then you gon' see 
You'll never find nobody better than me 

[Chorus] 
In the night, I hear 'em talk, 
the coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless... 
How could you be so heartless? 
Oh... How could you be so heartless? 

[Verse 3] 
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk 
Baby let's just knock it off 
They don't know what we been through 
They don't know 'bout me and you 
So I got something new to see 
And you just gon' keep hatin' me 
And we just gon' be enemies 
I know you can't believe 
I could just leave it wrong 
And you can't make it right 
I'm gon' take off tonight 
Into the night.... 

[Chorus] 
In the night, I hear 'em talk, 
the coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless... 
How could you be so heartless? 
Oh... How could you be so heartless? ---Lyrics submitted by Bethany.
