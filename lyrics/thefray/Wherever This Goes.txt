I could slow down
Waste away in this town
Standing on the sidewalk
Watching this parade
Or we could get out
Pack our suitcase right now
Find ourselves a bus stop,
Make our own way!

Cause it feel like Ive been here forever
Afraid to be my father, and afraid to leave him too!
But its my name I painted on the doorway
Tells me where I came from and what I gotta do!

Whatever this goes (goes)
No matter how far (far)
Baby, you are the song thats written in our heart
Whatever we stand, wherever we fall
Dont matter at all, cause I will be forever yours
From this moment till the day curtains close
Dont matter at all, cause I will be forever yours
Wherever this goes!

So were here now
Finally found our way out
On the road to some place,
Some place that we dont know!
But its alright, keep on driving all night
Straight on to till morning, I know its a way to go

Cause it feel like weve been here forever
I dont how much further and where were going to
But its our name I painted on the doorway
It doesnt say where we came from, and what we gotta do

Oh, oh, oh whatever this goes (goes)
No matter how far (far)
Baby, you are the song thats written in our heart
Whatever we stand, wherever we fall
Dont matter at all, cause I will be forever yours
From this moment till the day curtains close
Dont matter at all, cause I will be forever yours
Wherever this goes!
No matter how far, baby you are the song its written on my heart
Wherever we stand, wherever we fall
Dont matter at all, cause I will be forever yours
From this moment till the day curtains close
Dont matter at all, cause I will be forever yours
Wherever this goes ---
