I found a picture in my basement
My face a hundred years ago
But I don't wanna do like he did
So full of pride and all alone

Escape is in my blood
The fear is in my bones
But I don't wanna walk that road
Please, help me?

Hold my hand,
I hear ghost calling.
Help me stand,
Even if the sky is falling.
And I want you to know,
I can't do it alone.
Hold my hand, my hand, my hand.

This is the burden that I carry
And it goes back a hundred years
The lovely shit I did,
I am done with it
He's got every right to leave
But stay with me

Hold my hand,
I can hear the ghost calling.
And help me stand,
Even if the sky is falling.
And I want you to know,
I can't do it alone.
Hold my hand, my hand, my hand

Hold my hand, hold my hand [2x]

You're the reason why,
I can write a different story
Lift me up, lift me up
I'm falling on my knees again, baby

Hold my hand,
I feel the ghost calling
Help me stand,
I can see the sky falling

Hold my hand,
I can hear the ghost calling.
Help me stand,
I can see the sky falling
And I need you to know,
I can't do it alone.
Hold my hand, my hand, my hand

Hold my hand, hold my hand
I need you now
Hold my hand, hold my hand
I need you to
Hold my hand, hold my hand
I can hear the ghost calling
Hold my hand, hold my hand ---
