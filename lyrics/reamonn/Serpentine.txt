Lost on a road going nowhere
Trying to take on the world
Searching for someone who understands
Sweet girl, sweet girl
Walking through fields of fire
Hopelessly reaching for the skies
Watching the flames growing higher
Tonight

And she danced like serpentine
Shes my burning desire
She mystifies
Her loves sets me on fire
Oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh oh oh.

Caught in a fear of embracing
Waiting for the beauty to arrive
All of the fears that youre facing
Sweet child sweet child
No one can stop us from reaching
Who says the Innocent survive
One more step into nowhere
goodbye

She danced like serpentine
Shes my burning desire
Shes mystifies
Her loves lifting me higher than high

No one can stand in our way
Nothing can stop us on this day
Ive never felt like this way

Cant let you slip away
Oh oh, Oh oh oh.
Cant let you slip away
Oh, oh, Oh oh oh.
Cant let you slip away
Oh oh ,Oh oh oh

She danced like serpentine
Shes my only desire
She mystifies
Her loves taking
Me higher---Lyrics submitted by Jay.
