When youre here
every thought I ever had becomes clear
But when youre far
the only light I ever see is the Stars
And when you go,
the feelings burn as they grow
Cause to me, to me youre Beautiful

But when youre here Josephine the stars dont shine so bright
But yeah with me Josephine Youd never sleep at night
But when youre here Josephine the stars dont shine so bright
But yeah with me Josephine Youd never sleep at night
But when you go I never sleep as I do

And in my dreams
I hold you like I never will release

But when youre here Josephine the stars dont shine so bright
But yeah with me Josephine Youd never sleep at night
But when youre here Josephine the stars dont shine so bright
But yeah with me Josephine Youd never sleep at night my Josephine
Im dreaming of you
Are you dreaming it too Im dreaming of you
I scream your name my Josephine

But when youre here Josephine the stars dont shine so bright
But yeah with me Josephine Youd never sleep at night
But when youre here Josephine the stars dont shine so bright
But yeah with me Josephine Youd never sleep at night my Josephine
Im dreaming of you
Are you dreaming it too Im dreaming of you
I scream your name---Lyrics submitted by Jay.
