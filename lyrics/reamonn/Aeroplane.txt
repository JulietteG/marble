I saw your name in a telephone book
As someone unlisted someone unknown
I guess you want to disappear
To another world
Where youre left on your own

And I know we could close our eyes
And fool ourselves
With nowhere left to hide
I thought that giving up
Would be easier
But its harder not to try

Cause in your heart is a hurt thats growing
Youre like a window to my world
Where no begin is where you are

(chorus)
I love you like an aeroplane
Thats taking me home again
Cause Im standing here in line
Cause some love just takes time

I love you like an aeroplane
Thats taking me home again
If youre searching for the truth
Its in the feelings I have for you
Its in the feelings I have for you

They say
Some things are forever and
Some things they only last a day
It its not getting better
If its difficult
Doesnt mean you turn away

I know you live your life
Like a melody
A song that wants to grow
I thought that giving up
Would be easier
But its harder letting go
Cause in your heart is a hurt thats growing
Youre like a window to my world
Where to begin is where you are

(chorus)
I love you like an aeroplane
Thats taking me home again
Cause Im standing here in line
Cause some love just takes time

I love you like an aeroplane
Thats taking me home again
If youre searching for the truth
Its in the feelings I have for you

I saw your name in a telephone book
As someone unlisted someone unknown
I guess you want to disappear
To another world
Where youre left on your own

And I know we could close our eyes
And tell yourself
Thats theres not much we can do
But Im not giving up
Im not giving up
On these feelings I have for you
Yeah these feelings I have for you
These feelings I have for you
These feelings I have for you
These feelings I have for you---Lyrics submitted by Jay.
