To walk this streets without you
I hate being on my own
So many souls around you
But it never feels like home
Home is where my heart is aching
Home

Home is where there's no mistaking
All this space between us
Isn't going anywhere
But it's ok to be us
Cause you 're far from being here
Here is where the sky gets lonely
Here
Here I dissappear

(chorus)
I'm a million miles from you
But if we hold on
Gotta hold on
I'm a million miles from you
But if we stay strong
I know we'll make it through

And all this time is passing
But every day's the same
So much shadow casting
I don't wanna place the blame
Cause the blame is just a mixed emotion
Blame
Blame it on the fear

(chorus)
I'm a million miles from you
But if we hold on
Gotta hold on
I'm a million miles from you
But if we stay strong
I know we'll make it through

Now the distance alone can change us
I've been lying to myself
Lying to myself
It's the moments apart that make us
See who we both really are

And I'm a million miles from you
But if we hold on
Gotta hold on
I'm a million miles from you
But if we stay strong
I know we'll make it through

I know we'll see it through
I'm a million miles from you
But if we stay strong
I know we'll make it through
I'm a million miles from you
I know we'll make it through
Gotta stay strong
Gotta be strong
You're a million miles away---Lyrics submitted by Jay.
