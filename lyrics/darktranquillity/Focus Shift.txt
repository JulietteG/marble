I think I just forgot
To pick up the shells
From a recent discharge
And you took the blame
Explanations falter
To ears fallen deaf
Wherever I go I get lost

A reference to something
That both of us knew
A nothing that favors the few
In the darkness electric we see
Of the silence that's spoken tonight

I think I have lost my language
Whatever I've said I deny
I think I have lost my way
Whatever was missing is gone

I let my focus shift

Your face is a map I fail to discover
Drowned in the sound, so lost in the order
It's an understated word, the un-breaking knowledge
Interlocked and holding, a stalemate to break
I take hold of the flame that unites
In the silence that speaks to me now

I think I have lost my language
Whatever I've said I deny
I think I have lost my way
Whatever was missing is gone

I let my focus shift

I struggle to find the words that negate my meaning
I fail to comprehend what message is given

I decline the slight of hand that leads to rejection
An attempt to find closure with no sense of pride
Drown the fury and swallow the fire
Drown the fury. Swallow the fire

I think I have lost my language
Whatever I've said I deny
I think I have lost my way
Whatever was missing is gone

I let my focus shift---Lyrics submitted by Alexander.
