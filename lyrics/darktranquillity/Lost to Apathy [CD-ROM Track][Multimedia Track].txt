Beyond the total weak despair?
Fail to resonate
Frailness of our body breaks
We'll disintegrate

No

By locks our filthy states?
Failure to communicate
None to secular?
Where no see no virtuous magic
Against the motions

I go inside as the trials will end
filter the nonsense and laugh at what's left
indecision - beyond vision
What matters taken away

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak,
Soon the battle is over,
Lost to apathy

So overcome with pointless tears
To retest pain receptors
Nothing matters ever here
Put up another reaction

These eyes will never see
Covered up from reality

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak,
Soon the battle is over,
Lost to apathy

The unknown world that you deny
No priority
Cannot fail if you never start
Unpredictable
I want to know
where did it end
For madness to start
Always the skeptic and never the part
The end of virtue , non-descriptive
It matters not
Not!

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak,
Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak,
Soon the battle is over,
Lost to apathy

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak,
Now the battle is over,
Lost to apathy---Lyrics submitted by Alexander.
