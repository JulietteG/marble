We're not alone
We're not alone

She's got the rays of the sun now
Flowing through her hair as she turns around
And the waves of the sea rising up underneath

We've got the way to a lovin age
Pourin out my skin like a lover's face
To the ground, let it seep into the clouds oh

Don't try and fly, no we need a ladder
Up to the sky, where we're climbing higher up
And let the love on my hand take your side, yeah yeah yeah
If you look into my eyes you will see I'm alive

Woah oh oh oh oh oh x4

We've got the way to a lovin age again
We've got the way to a lovin age again
(We're not alone x2)

If you hold back you won't know that thrill
If you come back you'll see me, I'm living my life again oh

Don't try and fly, no we need a ladder
Up to the sky, where we're climbing higher up
You let the love on my hand take your side, it's alright yeah
If you look into my eyes you will see I'm alive
If you look into my eyes you will see I'm alive

Woah oh oh oh oh oh x12

If you hold back you won't know that thrill
If you come back you'll see me, I'm living my life again oh

If you look into my eyes you will see I'm alive yeah x4---Lyrics submitted by raychelle.
