Well I've been in love with love
And the idea of
Something binding us together
You know that love is strong enough.
And I've seen time tell tales
About that systematic drug
Yeah, that heart that beats as one,
It's collectively, unconsciously composed.

I lost my head in San Francisco
Waiting for the fog to roll out
But I found it in a rain cloud, it was smiling down.
Do you feel the love, I feel the love.
C'mon, c'mon let's start it up,
Let it pour out of your soul. ---Lyrics submitted by Austin Lane.
