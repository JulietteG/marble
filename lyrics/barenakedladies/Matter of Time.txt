Time heals when both wheels
Slide off the shoulder
The car flips, your heart skips
And I'm sad and sober

I forfeit
To you for the moment
Swore this
Wasn't gonna go bent
More fits
Guess it was a matter of time
At war with anything and anyone
That you're with
I really got to hand it to you
For this
I guess it was a matter of time
I guess it was a matter of time

Time flies
And goodbyes
Pile up behind you
You release
You make peace
They come back to find you

I forfeit
To you for the moment
Swore this
Wasn't gonna go bent
More fits
Guess it was a matter of time
At war with anything and anyone
That you're with
I really got to hand it to you
For this
I guess it was a matter of time
I guess it was a matter of time

Was it just a matter of time? (time, time, time)
Maybe it was all in your mind (time, time, time)
Tell me was that over the line? (time)
'Cause everybody's doin' just fine (time, time)

I forfeit
To you for the moment
Swore this
Wasn't gonna go bent
More fits
Guess it was a matter of time
We're at war with anything and anyone
That you're with
I really got to hand it to you
For this
I guess it was a matter of time
I guess it was a matter of time

I guess it was a matter of time
I guess it was a matter of time
(More fits)
(Swore this)
(Forfeit, time)

I guess it was a matter of time
(Forfeit)
(You're this)
(For this time, time)

I guess it was a matter of time---
