[Verse 1]
Moving at the speed of sound, you think Id be slowing down
But Im not losing my momentum
There are ways to turn around, so I dont crash into the ground
I wish someone would invent them

[Bridge]
Despite the pretty dress and curls
You dont throw like other girls
You follow through

[Chorus]
But I come on back, cause I know
That though you meant to let me go
I could always be your boomerang
I come on back, you will see
That all you said got through to me
And I would like to be your boomerang

[Verse 2]
Goin down but no one knew, I was losing altitude
I shouldve landed and I tried to
I never took my eyes off you, but I got dizzy and you threw
Me, you were right to

[Chorus]
But I come on back, cause I know
That though you meant to let me go
I could always be your boomerang
I come on back, you will see
That all you said got through to me
And I would like to be your boomerang

[Middle 8]
I flew apart but they reattached me
Im coming in hot, hope you catch me

[Chorus X2]
But I come on back, cause I know
That though you meant to let me go
I could always be your boomerang
I come on back, you will see
That all you said got through to me
And I would like to be your boomerang

Yeah, I would like to be your boomerang
Let me be your boomerang
I would like to be your boomerang---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
