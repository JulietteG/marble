Don't the hours grow shorter as the days go by?
You never get to stop and open your eyes
One minute you're waiting for the sky to fall
And next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all.

Lovers in a dangerous time (X2)

These fragile bodies that touch and taste
This vibrant skin this hair like lace
Spirits open to the thrust of grace
Never a breath you could afford to waste

Lovers in a dangerous time (X4)

(musical bridge)

When you're lovers in a dangerous time
Sometimes you made to feel as if your love's a crime
Nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight
Gotta kick at the darkness til it bleeds daylight

Lovers in a dangerous time (X4)

We were lovers in a dangerous time
We were lovers in a dangerous time
La lovers, la lovers la lovers
La lovers in a dangerous time.---Lyrics submitted by C.
