Struck by lightning, sounds pretty frightening
But you know the chances are so small
Stuck by a bee sting, nothing but a B-thing
Better chance youre gonna bite it at the mall
But its a twenty-three four-to-one 
That you can fall in love by the end of this song
So get up, get up
Tell the bookie put a bet on not a damn thing will go wrong

The odds are that we will probably be alright
Odds are we gonna be alright, odds are we gonna be alright tonight
The odds are that we will probably be alright
Odds are we gonna be alright, odds are we gonna be alright for another night

Hit by the A-Train, crashed in an airplane
I wouldnt recommend either one
Killed by a Great White or a meteorite
I guess there aint no way to go thats fun
But somewhere in the world someone is gonna fall in love by the end of this song
So get up, get up
No its never gonna let up so you might as well sing along

The odds are that we will probably be alright
Odds are we gonna be alright, odds are we gonna be alright tonight
The odds are that we will probably be alright
Odds are we gonna be alright, odds are we gonna be alright for another night

Sure things go wrong, but Ill take my chances
Odds are long, so why not play?

Struck by lightning, sounds pretty frightening
But you know the chances are so small
Hit by the A-Train, crashed in an airplane
Better chance youre gonna bite it at the mall
But its a twenty-three four-to-one 
That you can fall in love by the end of this song
So get up, get up
No Im never gonna let up so you might as well sing along

The odds are that we will probably be alright
Odds are we gonna be alright, odds are we gonna be alright tonight
The odds are that we will probably be alright
Odds are we gonna be alright, odds are we gonna be alright for another night

The odds are that we will probably be alright
Odds are we gonna be alright, odds are we gonna be alright tonight
The odds are that we will probably be alright
Odds are we gonna be alright, odds are we gonna be alright for another night---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
