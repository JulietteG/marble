It was in pieces til this adhesive
Stuck it together, now it beats again
Its working alright, and it looks tight
A little miracle Id recommend

I could use another roll, another roll
I could use another roll right now

Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Your best wont make it fall apart
Because Ill always have enough, enough
For when I gotta tape it up, it up
Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Cos no ones ever gonna tear that thing apart

A million uses, you know the truth is
There isnt any heart that it cant fix
When you went through one, just make a new one??
And make a wallet out of extra bits

I could use another roll, another roll
I could use another roll right now

Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Your best wont make it fall apart
Because Ill always have enough, enough
For when I gotta tape it up, it up
Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Cos no ones ever gonna tear that thing apart

Woohoo, woohoo
Woohoo, woohoo

Polyethylene gold, pressure-sensitive tape
Its tried, its true, nothing it cant do
Fixed the Fender on the rover that was left on the moon
Its good enough for you

Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Your best wont make it fall apart
Because Ill always have enough, enough
For when I gotta tape it up, it up
Stop messing with my duct tape heart
Cos no ones ever gonna tear that thing apart---
