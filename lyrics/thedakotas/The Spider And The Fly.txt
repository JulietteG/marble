Tell the tale of a poor boy
Kind of plain and shy
There was nothin' that could save him
Just like the spider and the fly

It's like living in a nightmare
Please sympathize
It's so easy to get caught there
Just like the spider and the fly
Just like the spider and the fly

She's the spider and the fly
Makes me wonder why
I stay here even though she's insincere
I stay here 'coz I love her
I stay here even though she's insincere
I stay here 'coz I love her

Guitar Break

She's the spider and the fly
Makes me wonder why
I stay here even though she's insincere
I stay here 'coz I love her
I stay here even though she's insincere
I stay here 'coz I love her

You see the fate of a poor boy
Caught in a web of lies
See the thread all around him
Just like the spider and the fly
Just like the spider and the fly
Just like the spider and the fly
Just like the spider and the fly---Lyrics submitted by Andrew Hetherington.
