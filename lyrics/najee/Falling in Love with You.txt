Oooohhh

(Verse 1)
I didn't mean to make you cry
I never meant to make you sad
I apologize for treating you that way
But there's something that I really need to say

(Verse 2)
I thought it over in my mind
I wanna make it right this time
Ain't it funny how the heart can make you do silly things?
And now that we're alone, I wanna say to you

(Chorus) 
I'm falling in love with you
I'm crazy about you
(Can you find it in your heart to please forgive?)
I wanna spend my life with you
Cause I'm falling in love with you

Oh oh, oh whoa oh oh
Ooooh

(Chorus)
I'm falling in love with you
I'm crazy about you
I wanna spend my life with you
Cause I'm falling in love with you

My love for you
My love for you grows stronger everyday

Don't you ever go no where
My love is here to stay

(Chorus) 
I'm falling in love with you
I'm crazy about you
I wanna spend my life with you
Cause I'm falling in love with you x2

Cause I'm falling in love with you---Lyrics submitted by Aly.
