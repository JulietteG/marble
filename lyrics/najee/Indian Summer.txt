(Verse 1)
It was around a year ago
About this time, I know 
All the leave were brown and gold
It was the day you said to me
Our love was no more

(Chorus)
So when you  cross my mind
I think about that Indian Summer
Cause that's around the time you made me cry
And when you cross my mind
I think about that Indian Summer
Remembering the time you said goodbye

(Verse 2)
As I look back on you and I
A tear comes to my eye
On this warm October night (ahh oohh)
In my poor heart I'll hide away
It's gone with yesterday

(Chorus)
So when you  cross my mind
I think about that Indian Summer
Cause that's around the time you made me cry
And when you cross my mind
I think about that Indian Summer
Remembering the time you said goodbye

(Bridge)
And even though I try to carry on as though
Our love is nothing more than a memory of ours (?)
But you will always be the one my heart belongs to
Still there's nothing I can do (oooh)
