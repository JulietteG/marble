I open my eyes i try to see 
but i'm blinded by the white light
I can't remember how
 I can't remember why
I'm lying here tonight
And i can't stand the pain 
and i can't make it go away no i can't stand the pain

CHORUS
How could this happen to me
 i made my mistakes
i've got nowhere to run
the night goes on as i'm fading away
i'm sick of this life, i just want to scream
how could this happen to me

Everybody's screaming 
I try to make a sound but no one hears me
I'm slipping off the edge
I'm hanging by a thread
I wanna start this over again
so i try to hold
onto a time when nothing mattered
and i can't    erase the things that i've done
no i can't 

CHORUS

how could this happen to me---Lyrics submitted by Kayleigh.
