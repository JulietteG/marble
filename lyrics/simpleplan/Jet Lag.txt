What time is it where you are? 
I miss you more than anything 
Back at home you feel so far 
Waitin for the phone to ring 
It's gettin lonely livin upside down 
I don't even wanna be in this town 
Tryin to figure out the time zones makin me crazy 

You say good morning 
When it's midnight 
Going out of my head 
Alone in this bed 
I wake up to your sunset 
It's drivin me mad 
I miss you so bad 
and my heart heart heart is so jetlagged 

What time is it where you are? 
5 more days and i'll be home 
I keep your picture in my car 
I hate the thought of you alone 

I've been keepin busy all time 
Just to try to keep you off my mind 
Tryin to figure out the time zones makin me crazy 

You say good morning 
When it's midnight 
Going out of my head 
Alone in this bed 
I wake up to your sunset 
It's drivin me mad 
I miss you so bad 

and my heart heart heart is so jetlagged 
heart heart heart is so jetlagged (x2) 
is so jetlagged 

Oh oh 
Oh oh 

I miss you so bad(x4) 
I wanna share your horizon (I miss you so bad) 
And see the same sunrise (I miss you so bad) 
And turn hour hand back to when you were holding me 


You say good morning 
When it's midnight 
Going out of my head 
Alone in this bed 
I wake up to your sunset 
It's drivin me mad 
I miss when you say good morning 
When it's midnight 
Going out of my head 
Alone in this bed 
I wake up to your sunset 
It's drivin me mad 
I miss you so bad 
and my heart heart heart is so jetlagged 
heart heart heart is so jetlagged (x2) 
is so jetlagged---Lyrics submitted by Akshay.
