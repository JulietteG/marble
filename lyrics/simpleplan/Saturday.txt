S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y

Ticking like a time bomb, waiting for the weekend
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
People throw their hands up higher than the ceiling
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
I can see the line up running 'round the whole party
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Coming through the window, I can hear the bass drum
(Saturday night, Saturday night)

We don't have to go, we can stay right here

We can go get drunk, staying up all night
Singing "Don't Stop Believing" til the morning light
We can line up shots til it all goes bad
And we're passed out and puking in a taxi cab
When you're lying here by my side (Oh yeah!)
Nowhere else feels right (Oh yeah!)
I'd rather be alone with you on a Saturday night

S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y

This is gonna be a night so epic
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
You and me baby, nothing but Netflix
(Saturday night, Saturday night)

We don't have to go, we can stay right here

We can go get drunk, staying up all night
Singing "Don't Stop Believing" til the morning light
We can line up shots til it all goes bad
And we're passed out and puking in a taxi cab
When you're lying here by my side (Oh yeah!)
Nowhere else feels right (Oh yeah!)
I'd rather be alone with you on Saturday night

If we ever get bored, if we get restless
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
We can get dressed up, let's get epic

S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y

We can go get drunk, staying up all night
Singing "Don't Stop Believing" til the morning light
We can line up shots til it all goes bad
And we're passed out and puking in a taxi cab
We'll stop on every bar on the boulevard
Til we max out the limits on my credit card
When I've got you here by my side (Oh Yeah!)
Everything feels right (Oh yeah!)
As long as it's me and you on Saturday night

S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y---
