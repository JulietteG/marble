Stop being such a freak
Nobody wants you here
That's what they said to me

There's something wrong with you
Why don't you disappear?
That's what they said to me

Why should we all be stereotypes?
Why don't we all just stand up and fight?
In my blood
In my veins
In my heart
I know whats right for me

So I refuse
To apologize for who I am
And I refuse
To ever let somebody say I can't
I refuse
So I refuse
To let the words you say get to me
And I refuse
To keep on suffering quietly
I refuse
So I refuse

You'll never make it far
You're just a hopeless case
(That's what they said to me)

How can I make it clear?
You're just a big mistake
(That's what they said to me)

You don't control me this is my life
When will you wake up and open your eyes?
In my blood
In my veins
In my heart
I know whats right for me

No matter what you think
You wont decide my fate
I can do anything
No matter what you say
Cause In my blood
In my veins
In my heart
I know whats right for me---
