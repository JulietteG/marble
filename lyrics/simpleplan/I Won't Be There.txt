I don't wanna make this
Harder than i have to
This is how it has to be
There's so many things i want to say
But you just don't listen to me

I don't want to hurt you
You don't want to hurt me
I can't stand you
And you can't stand me
We can't rearrange
You can never change me
Say goodbye
Nothing i say could change your mind

Because
I can't stay
Tomorrow i'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there
I won't be there

Everything i say
You find a way to make it
Sound like i was born just yesterday
And everything you taught me
Doesn't mean a thing
So i'm going my way

I don't want to hurt you
You don't want to hurt me
I can't stand you
And you can't stand me
We can't rearrange
You can never change me
Say goodbye
Nothing i say could change your mind

Because
I can't stay
Tomorrow i'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there
I won't be there

This is the last night
Thet i spend at home
And it won't take too long
For you to notice
Won't take long for you to find out
That i'm gone

I can't stay
Tomorrow i'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake
I won't be there

I can't stay
Tomorrow i'll be on my way
So don't expect to find me sleeping in my bed
'Cause when you wake up
I won't be there
I won't be there
I won't be there
I won't be there
I won't be there---Lyrics submitted by May.
