i know a girl whos obsessed with a guy
she talks for hours and still tomorrow
she'll call again and when he thinks that this could be the end,
she calls again
at six in the morning she waits at the door
he tells her to leave but still tomorrow shell be there again 
she wont let go

cant you just go somewhere on vacation?
i could book your flight
and pack your bags
if you want
a one way ticket out of my life
watching you fly away
i never liked you

she doesnt care if he tries to ignore
he runs away but still she follows
shell try again
she likes to think shell get him in the end
yeah

cant you just go somewhere on vacation?
i could book your flight
and pack your bags
if you want
a one way ticket out of my life
watching you fly away
i never liked you
i never wanted you
i never liked you
i never wanted you, whoa

cant you just go somewhere on vacation?
i could book your flight
and pack your bags
if you want
a one way ticket out of my life
watching you fly away
i never liked you
i never wanted you
i never liked you
Im not in love with you---Lyrics submitted by unknown.
