Im reading through the Sunday paper and its all bad news
Im looking for a smile on the streets but its just no use
Sing with me now

I jump into my car, turn the key, but it just wont start
I got a text from my ex, its official she just broke my heart

Storm clouds are circling around
But I wont let that shit drag me down

So Ill be singing (Ill be singing)
Ill be singing (Ill be singing)
Ill be singing in the rain (Singing in the rain)
Ive got a song in my heart and Im bulletproof
Theres nothing in the world thats gonna kill this mood
No matter what life wants to throw my way
Ill be singing, Ill be singing in the rain

I went to see a fortune teller and she said Im doomed
But what the hell does she know
Why she trying to break my groove

All of lifes colors turn to gray
Then you turn around and you smile my way
Suddenly all my problems disappear on cue
(All because of you)---
