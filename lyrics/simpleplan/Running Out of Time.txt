It's just another day,
And it feels like you're still running late
'Cuz the times are gonna change,
And you're stuck in your old mentality

You can try to lead us on,
But there's no one else to blame
Won't be left to clean the mess when you're gone

We're running out of time!

We're running out of time,
And you just don't get it
Now you're watching people die,
And you still don't care
We're running out of time,
And you just don't get that this is how I feel
There's a million things I hate about you

It's just another battle,
When you exercise your authority
When the dust is finally settled,
Will you catch up with reality?

You've been waiting way too long
Now it's time for us to pay,
And we won't be looking back when you're gone

We're running out of time!

We're running out of time,
And you just don't get it
Now you're watching people die,

And you still don't care
We're running out of time,
And you just don't get that this is how I feel
There's a million things I hate about you (about you)

About you
About you (about you)
About you

I don't wanna hear the same excuses (don't wanna hear)
I don't wanna here the same excuses (don't wanna hear)
I don't wanna hear your story

We're running out of time,
And you just don't get it
You're watching people die,
And you still don't care
We're running out of time,
And you just don't get it
If everybody dies,
Will you still don't care?

We're running out of time,
And you just don't get it
Now you're watching people die,
And you still don't care
We're running out of time,
And you just don't get that this is how I feel
I don't wanna think about...
This is how I feel

There's a million things I hate about you
There's a million things I hate about you---Lyrics submitted by Pham.
