So you think you got me figured out
Why don't you go ahead and tell me what I'm all about
You know I'm dying to hear it
I'm gettin' sick of all the sticks and stones you throw
Now it feels like it's opinion overload
I can take it but I'd rather leave it

Get out of my face
Quit bringing me down
I don't care what you say
So what part of that don't you understand

Hey!
I'm doing things exactly like I want to
What part of that don't you understand
Hey!
And I don't give a damn if you don't approve
What part of that don't you understand
Hey!

You're so tough throwing punches with your words
You think you're clever, let me tell you that you're not the first
Say something I haven't heard yet
Disrespectful, always quick to judge
I kind of wonder if you're doing it just because
It must be nice being perfect

Get out of my face
Quit bringing me down
I don't care what you say
So what part of that don't you understand

Hey!
I'm doing things exactly like I want to
What part of that don't you understand
Hey!
And I don't give a damn if you don't approve
What part of that don't you understand
Hey!

I won't apologize for what I feel inside
I won't be pushed around
I won't be backing down
Not doing what you say
I'll never change my ways
Get out of my face

Hey!
I'm doing things exactly like I want to
What part of that don't you understand
Hey!
And I don't give a damn if you don't approve
What part of that don't you understand---
