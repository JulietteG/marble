Promised the world
Surrender your heart to the girl
But it's, never enough
There's always something pulling ya

Wander around
Down in the old part of the town
In the streets you used to run
Chased by the sun and moon
Now you found your way there
How long will you stay here

Don't look back
The paint is faded and cracked, baby
You can't hold on when it's gone

Tell her a lie
Follow that look in her eyes she knows; it's over
The way that you hold her she can tell
Now your days are racing by
There's no more time to wonder why

Don't look back (dont' look back)
The paint is faded and cracked, baby
You can't hold on when it's gone 

ohh ohh ohh

Don't look back
Time has covered your tracks girl
Standing still for so long
For so long; yeah

Yeah; Don't look back (dont' look back)
The paint is faded and cracked, baby
You can't hold on when it's gone

Don't look back (don't look back)
Time has covered your tracks girl
Standing still for too long
For to long OHH OHH

Don't look back (dont' look back)
The paint is faded and cracked baby
You can't hold on when it's gone

Ohh ohh---Lyrics submitted by Xero.
