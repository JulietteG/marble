Once in your life
You find what your looking for
A feeling you can't ignore
So right

Welcome to love
Welcome to paradise
Easy yet, very nice, alright

Even though you are having your doubts
We can still work it out
Sometimes its easy
Sometimes its not
But its still worth a shot

Don't walk away
Listen to your heart
Hear what it says
Cuz your heart won't lie, ooooh

Tears in your eyes
Frozen upon your face
Memories we can't replace...disappear

Nowhere to run
This time there is no place to hide
You are running but your hands are tied
by fear, oh yeah

Even though your are having your doubts
we can still work it out
sometimes its easy
sometimes its not
But its still worth a shot

Don't walk away
Listen to your heart
Hear what it says
Cuz your heart won't lie

Don't walk away
Love never let you down
Don't be afraid
It will be alright
Yeah, it will be alright.

Ooooh
Even though you are having your doubts
we can still work it out
somtiems its easy
sometimes its not
But its still worth a shot

Don't walk away
listen to your heart
hear what it says
Cuz your heart won't lie

Don't walk away
Love never let you down
don't be afraid
It will be alright
yeah, it will be alright

oooooooh
be alright
don't walk away---Lyrics submitted by Courtney.
