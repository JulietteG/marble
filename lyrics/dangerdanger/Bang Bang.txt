(Bang Bang)

It was a warm nite
On the south side of town
They said they'd seen ya
You were sneakin' around
with a stranger
Girl these rumors are drivin'
me mad.

All my good friends
turn their face to the wall
when they see me
What the hell's goin' on
am i so blind
That I can't see when i'm being had

I know it's silly
But girl I really thought we had a chance
I musta been crazy!

Chorus: 
(Bang Bang)
What's that sound
I gave you my love
And you shot me down

(Bang Bang)
You're so cool
Playin' a game
Someday you're gonna lose
(Bang! Bang!)

Girl you told me
You were not like the rest
then you showed me
Now you're failin' your test
It was easy
Just an urge in the heat of the nite

I believed you
now that's all in the past
Yeah I made some mistakes
But I'm learnin' fast
Never put your heart on the line!
Never put your heart on the line!

I know it's silly
But girl I really thought we had a chance
I musta been crazy

(Bang Bang)
What's that sound
I gave you my love 
And you shot me down

(Bang Bang)
You're so cool
Playin' a game
Someday you're gonna lose...

What's that sound
I gave you my love
And you shot me down

(Bang Bang)
You're so cool
playin' a game
Someday you're gonna lose

(Bang Bang)
What's that sound
I gave you my love
And you shot me down

(Bang Bang)
You're so cool
Playin' a game
Someday you're gonna lose

(Bang Bang)
What's that sound
I gave you my love
And you shot me down

(Bang Bang)
You're so cool
Playin' a game
Someday you're gonna lose

(Bang Bang)

You shot me down..
(You shot me down)

(Bang Bang)
Oh, oh, oh..oh, oh..Oh, oh, oh..

(Bang Bang)
