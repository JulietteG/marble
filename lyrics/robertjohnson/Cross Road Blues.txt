I went down to the crossroad
Fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroad
Fell down on my knees
Asked the lord above "Have mercy now
save poor Bob if you please"

Yeeooo, standin at the crossroad
Tried to flag a ride
Ooo ooo eee
I tried to flag a ride
Didn't nobody seem to know me babe
Everybody pass me by

Standin at the crossroad babe
Risin sun goin down
Standin at the crossroad babe
Eee eee eee, risin sun goin down
I believe to my soul now,
Poor Bob is sinkin down

You can run, you can run
Tell my friend Willie Brown
You can run, you can run
Tell my friend Willie Brown
(Th)'at I got the crossroad blues this mornin Lord
Babe, I'm sinkin down

And I went to the crossroad momma
I looked east and west
I went to the crossroad baby
I looked east and west
Lord, I didn't have no sweet woman
Ooh-well babe, in my distress---
