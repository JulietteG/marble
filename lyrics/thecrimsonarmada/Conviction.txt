MOVE!

Search your feelings
You know you've got that light in you
It shines through your eyes
Make no mistake
No sin can put out that flame

So let it burn
Let the spirit take a hold
Be at peace as you leave behind
The life that only held you down

You should know
That this love is unconditional
You should know that this love is unfailing

I raise my fist in conviction
The light I know is the only thing that sets me free

Not a chance could I call my faith perfect
But the perfection I serve is beyond worth it

So tell me what are you so afraid of?
God never gave up on you so come on and get your fist up!

I raise my fist in conviction
The light I know is the only thing that sets me free---Lyrics submitted by carlos castillo.
