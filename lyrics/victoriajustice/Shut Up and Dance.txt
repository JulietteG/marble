1st Verse:
It's nine on the dot
and we just talk and we talk
and I just wanted to stop
cause aren't we here for the music?
and if you dare, just get up out of your chair
cause we ain't going no where
we've gotta move or you lose it.

Bridge:
All I wanna know (know) 
Is when we're letting go so
we can get this record to break
what we waste to top (top)
we never can rewind 
all I'm really trying to say

Chorus:
Is shut up and dance show me what you got
shut up and dance are you in or not
your moving your mouth, baby don't speak
so shut up and dance if you're into me
Cuz I can wait no more, to get off the floor
don't stop now is your chance
Shut up and dance (dance)

2nd Verse (added verse):
The heat of the night
and we can do what we like
so don't you put up a fight
cuz I'll be driving you crazy
what would you do, if I get up next to you
you like the way that I move
I'm not your girl, but I could be

Chorus:
All I wanna know (know)
is when we're letting go so
we can get this record to break (break)
what we waste to top (top
we never can rewind 
all I'm really trying to say

Is shut up n dance show me what you got
shut up and dance are you in or not
you're moving your mouth baby don't speak
so shut up and dance if you're into me
Cuz I wait no more to get off the floor
don't stop now's our chance
Shut up and dance, dance, dance yea
Shut up and dance, dance, dance, yea

Verse 3:
Shut up and dance till we drop cause I'm sick of the space in between
You and me, lying up, till we're making a scene
Quit the talk, let it rock if you know what I mean.

Chorus:
Shut up n dance show me what you got
Shut up n dance are you in or not
Your moving your mouth baby don't speak
Shut up and dance if you're into me.
Cuz I can wait no more to get off the floor
Don't stop now's our chance
Shut up n dance, dance, dance yea
Put up your hands, hands,hands yea
Shut up and dance, dance, dance yea
Shut up and dance! ---Lyrics submitted by Jalissa.
