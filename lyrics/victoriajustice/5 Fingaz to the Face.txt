You know I flaunt cha, cuz girl I really want cha
 and you lookin' nice, got me cooler than a bag of ice
 Now freeze, freeze, freeze, now go
 Drop it fast and move it real slow, oh!
 What?!

You smell so fruity
 I'm a pirate and you're my booty (arg)
 So move it in close
 and let me have my daily dose (uhhh)

Girl, I havta think about you, think about me,
 Whatcha think about it?

Five fingaz to the face (eh eh eh-ehh)
 Five fingaz to the face (oh its like that)
 Five fingaz to the face (rip rip rip-rear)
 Five fingaz to the face (eh eh eh-ehh)

I love Martina, Vanessa, and Georgina
 It's a ladies choice, Ima make sure to make some noise (oh)
 And now we're sweatin', got my turbo engine reevin', vroom
 They stop and stare, all the haters think it's just not fair,
 That I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun
 And I'm about to put this club in gear
 So fellas grab a cup, what
 all my ladies you know what's up, yeah
 put your hands to the sky if you're feelin' fly, and tell me that you, what?!
 Cuz I'm the man in charge, and ya know I'm livin' large
 I got a big white house and a fancy yacht, and a garage full of classic cars
 what you talking bout' boy?, oh calm down
 I know you don't think you can just come up in here and buy me!
 come on, you know what I got for you

Five fingaz to the face (rip rip rip-rear)
 Five fingaz to the face (eh eh eh-ehh)
 Five fingaz to the face (rip rip rip-rear)
 Five fingaz to the face (eh eh eh-ehh)
 OH!!!---Lyrics submitted by Kelcie Widcamp.
