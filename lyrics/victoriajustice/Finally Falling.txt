Suddenly, 
My choice is clear
 I knew that only you and I were standing here
 And beautiful, 
Is all I see
 It's only you I know it's true, 
It has to be

That money isn't worth a thing if you didn't earn it, 
You don't deserve it
 True love doesn't cost a thing
 And if you try to buy it, 
You can't return it
 No, no, no woah
 Your friends doing all the same things
 And my friends
 Look at what you're wasting
 It doesn't matter if you change their minds

 Suddenly I can see what I didn't before
 And I don't care what they say anymore
 Cause I'm falling 
 I'm finally falling

I don't need all the finer things, diamond rings are nothing
 So show me something
 Cause love is all I need and all I ever wanted
 And now I got it
 Eh, eh, eh, eh
 My friends wonder what you're thinking
 And your friends will
 Probably think the same thing
 It doesn't matter if we change their minds

 Suddenly I can see what I didn't before
 And I don't care what they say anymore
 Cause I'm falling, falling
 I'm finally falling, falling

If you can't find love when your in it
 Just forget it
 It would change your mind once you get it
 Don't you get it?
 Cause we did it
 Yea we did it
 Well we did it

 Suddenly I can see what I didn't before
 And I don't care what they say anymore
 Cause I'm falling
 I'm finally falling 

Suddenly I can see what I didn't before
 And I don't care what they say anymore
 Cause I'm falling
 I'm finally falling 

Finally falling
 I'm finally falling---Lyrics submitted by Holleigh Baker 15.
