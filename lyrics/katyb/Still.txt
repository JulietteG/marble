[Verse 1:]
You chose the simple life
My love was way too much for you to bear
And left our world to end right there
But I still hear you whispering my name
Surely there's a part unchanged
How could you be so far away
When I still see your face like it was only yesterday
And although you're out of sight
Would you still be the same if I was next to you tonight?

[Chorus:]
Still
Still on my mind now, still
You still know how to make me feel
How come these wounds won't heal
You're still on my mind now, still

[Verse 2:]
Now how could I compete
With something bigger than the both of us
Why were we not good enough
We gave it all and watched it burn away
But the ashes still remain
I wonder what it is you say
When you close your eyes, what do you ask for when you pray
What do you need to sooth your soul
Why can't I find something else to make sense of it all

[Chorus:]
Still
Still on my mind now, still
You still know how to make me feel
How come these wounds won't heal
You're still on my mind now, still

[Bridge:]
I can't let go, don't wanna let go
I can't let go, don't wanna let go

[Verse 3:]
Still
Still on my mind now, still
You still know how to make me feel
How come these wounds won't heal?
You still have the power
Still, when we walked away
I thought we'd fade to gray
Thinking if you feel the same
If I don't want to heal
Why won't this heart beat still?
You're still on my mind now, still
You're still on my mind now, still---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
