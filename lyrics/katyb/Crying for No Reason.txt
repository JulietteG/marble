I pushed all my problems to the back of my mind
Then they surfaced in my dreams, vague on the light
I sweep all my issues to somewhere I can find
In hope that I'll forget but there's just so many times

Why can't I be strong and just confront all my fears?
When my fear is hurting you I'm being sincere
But how many more days can I run? How many years?
Emotions flooding and I was so soon and so clear

Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking down?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force

I pushed all my problems to the back of my brain
A darkness deep inside where I can't find my way
How can I walk with a smile? Get on with my day
When I decieved myself pretending it's all okay

I tried my best to hold it all together, I know
The strings have worn away and now I'm all exposed
I try to hide it all away on top of the shelf
I can lie to everyone but not to myself

Crying for no reason feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking down?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force

Forgive me now 'cause I said that I'll be there for you, care for you
I let you down, I walked away
'Cause there were things I couldn't say to you
I'm breaking now

[x2]
I burned some bridges down
There must be some way out
The voices speak so loud
Will you forgive me now?

Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking now?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force---
