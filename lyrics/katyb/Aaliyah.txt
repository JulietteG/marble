(feat. Jessie Ware)

He only plays for you
He likes to watch the way you move
And I can see it on his face
Desire burning like a furnace

Aaliyah, please don't take my man
Although you know that you can
I never met a boy so true
But there's just something that you do

Aaliyah, please, this is green envy
Why must you taunt me, girl?
Aaliyah, please, this is green envy
Why must you taunt me, girl?

Aaliyah, please, this is green envy
Why must you taunt me, girl?
Aaliyah, please, oh this is green envy
Why must you taunt me, girl?

Another poor excuse
Another bending round the truth
And I'm so tired of pretending
I don't believe in the defend here

All I want is this
Woman to woman, no promise
Give me your word that you will free him
No more games and all your teasing

Aaliyah, please, this is green envy
Why must you taunt me, girl?
Aaliyah, please, this is green envy
Why must you taunt me, girl?

Aaliyah, please, this is green envy
Why must you taunt me, girl?
Aaliyah, please, oh this is green envy
Why must you taunt me, girl?

With every move you make
You know you've got him transfixed
But you can't get past me, Aaliyah
I won't fall for your tricks

There's no stopping him
As the beat rolls on
I watch from afar
And watch you sing along

With every move you make
You know you've got him transfixed
But you can't get past me, Aaliyah
I won't fall for your tricks

There's no stopping him
As the beat rolls on
I watch from afar
And watch you sing along

And watch you sing along
And watch you sing along
And watch you sing along
And watch you sing along
And watch you sing along
And watch you sing along
And watch you sing along
And watch you sing along

Why can't he play a song for me?
Why can't he play a song for me?
Why can't he play a song for me?
Why can't he play a song for me?
Why can't he play a song for me?
Why can't he play a song for me?
Why can't he play a song for me?
Why can't he play a song for me? ---
