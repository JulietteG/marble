Where was I when your tears were falling?
Where was I when you needed a friend?
Where was I when your heart was calling?
Do you not remember
Well Ill tell you then

You know I remained right by your side
Push through the rain and into the fire
Coz when I said I loved you
Thats just what I meant
So when you asked me where was I when
Every time I was right by your side

Where was my love when your heart was bleeding?
Was it not enough just to be your man?
When you had no feeling where were my hands?
If you dont remember well Ill tell you then

You know I remained right by your side
Push through the rain and into the fire
Coz when I said I loved you
Thats just what I meant
So when you asked me where was I when
Every time I was right by your side

Well dont you know that Ive given the best of me
Ive done it all but you still dont want to see
That I remained by your side

Push through the rain and into the fire
Coz when I said I loved you
Thats just what I meant
So when you asked me where was I when
Every time I was right by your side

Right by your side
Right by your side
I was right by your side ---Lyrics submitted by Betty Dickie.
