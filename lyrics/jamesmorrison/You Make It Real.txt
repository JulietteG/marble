There's so much craziness, surrounding me,
So much going on, it gets hard to breathe,
And all my faith has gone,To bring you back to me,
You make it real for me. 

Now I'm not sure of my priorities,
When I've lost sight of where I'm meant to be.
Like holy water, washing over me,
You make it real for me. 

And I'm running to you baby,
'Cause you are the only one that saves me.
That's why I've been missing you lately,
You make it real for me. 

When my head is strong but my heart is weak,
I'm full of arroganceand uncertainty.
I can't find the words you teach my heart to speak.
You make it real for me. 

And I'm running to you baby,
'Cause you are the only one who saves me.
That's why I've been missing you lately,
You make it real for me. 

Everybody's talking in words I don't understand,
You've got to be the only one who knows just who I am.
You're shining in the distance, I hope I can make it through
'Cause the only place I want to be is right back home with you. 

I guess there's so much I have to learn,
But if you're here with me, I know which way to turn.
You always give me somewhere, somewhere I can run.
You make it real for me. 

And I'm running to you baby,
'Cause you are the only one who saves me. 
That's why I've been missing you lately, 
You make it real for me.

You make it real for me.
