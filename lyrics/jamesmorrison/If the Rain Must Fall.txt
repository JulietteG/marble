Oh life can be strange
Good and bad in so many ways
And in time you will find
That things are not always what they seem

Well i've got something to say
But you might laugh, joke or run away
Cuz i'm awkward and nervous
Sometimes i don't say much at all

But if the rain must fall
If i lose it all
If the world comes down
and takes my soul
If the sky turns black
And there's no, no way back
It won't matter much to me
If i had you

All i need is your love
That's all i need
All i need is your love

Oh well dreams can come true
If you know inside you really want them to
Or you can sit you can wait
You can leave your fate in someone else's hands

Oh but I, I want you
And nothing else can make me feel the way you do
So I'm waiting, I'm wishing
That it's me you'll be holding tonight and every night

But if the rain must fall
If i lose it all
If the world comes down
and takes my soul
If the sky turns black
And there's no, no way back
It won't matter much to me
If i had you

All i need is your love
That's all i need
All i need is your love, your love

If the rain must fall
If i lose it all
If the world comes down
and takes my soul
If the sky turns black
And there's no, no way back
It won't matter much to me
If i had you

All i need is your love---Lyrics submitted by Elbert.
