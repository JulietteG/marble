Like a Western town, no sheriff around
You're an outlaw, a thief in the night
I kept up my guard, but you're making it hard
For an honest man to give a good fight

[Chorus]
I see you, and I'll raise you
And I'll call your bluff
I see you holding aces
It ain't enough
When it comes down to love
When it comes down to love

This frontier is wild
This trail leads for miles
Simple and free are the days
I sleep under stars
While time heals these scars
A fire keeps the darkness away

[Chorus]

When the morning breaks
And the clouds give way to blue
Just know, yeah just know
I'm thinking of you

[Solo]

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Alex Johnston.
