[Chorus]
If I could have a nickel
For every time I think of you
Or one for every ache that's in my heart
Or even one for miles between
Your heart and this lonesome fool
I'd have enough to get me back to you

If I didn't need the money
I sure wouldn't take this job
For one day soon I'm sure I'll have enough
To get me back in your arms
Back to where my heart belongs
Who was the fool who said money can buy love

[Chorus]

A few cents for this letter
Is all that I can spare
To let you know I'm saving every dime
For the day I pack my kids
And leave them all behind
I keep tellin' myself you'll be mine

[Chorus]

All that glitters, all that shines
Don't mean nothing in this life
If I can't hold you

[Chorus]

(If I could have a nickel)

If I could have a nickel
For every time I think of you---Lyrics submitted by Alex Johnston.
