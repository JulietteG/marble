Don't judge me
By my weight in gold
You can see
What my heart holds
Yeah, I can't give you 
Treasures found of this world
Whoa, what I'll give you's
Worth more than a pile of pearls

Don't judge me
By these clothes I wear
You can see
How my heart shines
Oh, I can't give you 
Treasures found of this world
Oh, what I'll give you's
Worth more than a pile of pearls

I can't give you 
Treasures found of this world
What I'll give you's
Worth more than a pile of pearls

Oh, I can't give you 
Treasures found of this world
Oh, what I'll give you's
Worth more than a pile of pearls---Lyrics submitted by Alex Johnston.
