On my way to Birmingham
That sad and still town
Your home where you learned to love
Yeah, you're home forever now
Your home forever now

[Chorus]
And I do know, and I do know, where to go
And I do know, and I do know, where to go
I'm goin' to Birmingham

On my way to Birmingham
To say my last goodbye
Yeah life it just comes and goes
But I know you're happy now
Yeah I know you're happy now

[Chorus]

Oh your shining star
Is burning bright tonight
It's there to guide me home
And lead me through... life

[Solo]

And I do know (I know)
And I do know (I know)
Where to go (I know where to go [2X])
And I do know (I know)
And I do know (I know)
Where to go (I know where to go [2X])

I'm goin' to Birmingham [4X]
I said
Na na na na na na, na na na na na [4x]

[Solo]

Na na na na na na, na na na na na [8x]---Lyrics submitted by Alex Johnston.
