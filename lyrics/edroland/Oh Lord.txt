Oh Lord, where ya runnin' to
Oh Lord, I'm not done with you... yet.

Oh Lord, I'm broken as can be
Oh Lord, mm hmm, give me words of strength
Oh Lord, I'm in need of a friend
Oh Lord, I am a man stained with sin

Oooo ooo, sha la la la, sha la, sha la [4X]

All these days they just float away
Like a cloud that I once did see
So come on, yeah come on Lord, and just save me

Oh Lord, just a moment of your time
Oh Lord, forgiveness would do me fine
Oh Lord, I'm on my bended knee
Oh Lord, can you save a wretch like me

Oooo ooo, sha la la la, sha la, sha la [4X]
Oh Lord, don't forget about me
Oh Lord, have mercy on me
