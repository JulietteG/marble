Try and put your arms around a hundred year old tree
climb up on a horse and let him run full speed
take a look down at the world at 30,000 feet on your next flight

watch a flock of birds against the morning sun
close your eyes and listen to the river run
catch a firefly in your hand or a rain drop on your tongue 
thats right

[CHORUS]
there is a God
there is a God
there is a God
how much proof do you need

plant a seed and see what comes out of the ground
find a heart beat on your babies ultrasound
in a few years hear him laughing dont it sound like a song

stop and think about what you dont understand
things like life and love and how the world began
hear a doctor say we cant explain it but the cancers gone

[CHORUS]

science says its all just circumstance
like this whole worlds just an accident
but if you want to shoot that theory down
look around
just look around 

[CHORUS]x2---Lyrics submitted by Amber.
