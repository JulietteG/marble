This mornin' is Monday
Where are you now
Teasin' my memory
Teachin' me how
To lay low
When I don't want to

Your love is elusive
This I know now
It's makin' me crazy
Leavin' me out
In the open
When I don't want to

Baby, 
I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down
More than I've already been
Just like a wild fire
You're runnin' all over town
As much as you burn me baby
I should be ashes by now

The moments of pleasure
Just never do last
Gone like a suitcase
Full of your past
Long gone
And in a hurry

Baby, 
I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down
More than I've already been
Just like a wild fire
You're runnin' all over town
As much as you burn me baby
I should be ashes by now

You're runnin all over town
As much as you burn me baby
I should be ashes by now

Just like a wild fire
You're runnin' all over town
As much as you burn me baby 
I should be ashes by now
As much as you burn me baby
I should be ashes by now

Ooh, ooh, oooh
Ashes by now
Ooh, ooh, oooh
Ashes by now

As much as you burn me baby
I should be ashes by now---Lyrics submitted by Jammie.
