Ain't it just like one us to pick the phone and call after a couple of drinks
and say how you been i been wondering if maybe you've been thinking about me
and somewhere in the conversation an old familiar invitation always arrives
and I may hate myself in the morning 
but i'm gonna love you tonite
Everyone's known someone 
that they just can't help but want
and even tho we just can't make it work out
well the want to lingers on
so once again we whine up in each others arms pretending that it's right
and i may hate myself in the morning 
but i'm gonna love you tonight
I know it's wrong 
but it ain't easy moving on
so why can't two friends 
remember the goods times once again

And tomorrow when i wake up 
i'll be feeling little guilty, a little sad
thinking how it use to be before everything went bad
i guess that's what it is
and only late night calls like this
that we try to find
and i may hate myself in the morning 
but i 'm gonna love you tonigt
and i may hate myself in the morning 
but i'm gonna love you tonigt---Lyrics submitted by Nadine.
