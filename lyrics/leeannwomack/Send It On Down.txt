Dad used to own the hardware store
But now it and him aint around no more
Dont know the whole story but Ive overheard some
I know hes who I got my drinking from

Jesus can you save me
From going crazy
I need some help getting out of this town
Are there any answers
Up in the hereafter
Oh if you got something wont you send it on down
While Im still able to be found

Guys around here want a girl whos rich
Even if I was I wouldnt be no catch
But this aint where Ill be settling down
I wanna be gone when the fall rolls around

Sitting in the bleachers at the football field
Got a pretty good buzz from a quart I just killed
its a cold Sunday morning and the church bells ring
I can just about hear all the good folks sing

Oh if you got something wont you send it on down
While Im still able to be found---
