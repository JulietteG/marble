Everybody needs a reason to believe
Something to keepem going
To set their soul on fire
Makeem feel alive
Its their inspiration

Some find it in living of the land
Some find it in working for the man
Some find it with a bottle in their hand
Thats what gets them through
Some find it in a shiny limousine 
Some find in the magazines they read
Some find happiness is out of reach
No matter what they do 
Baby thats not me 
I found it in you

I always wondered when my search was gonna end
And Id find what Ive been missing
Now everything you are 
It goes right to my heart
And it feeds this passion

Some find it in living of the land
Some find it in working for the man
Some find it with a bottle in their hand
Thats what gets them through
Some find it in a shiny limousine 
Some find in the magazines they read
Some find happiness is out of reach
No matter what they do 
Baby thats not me 
I found it in you

Youre my journeys end, my solid ground
Youre what I could never live without

Some find it in living of the land
Some find it in working for the man
Some find it with a bottle in their hand
Thats what gets them through
Some find it in a shiny limousine 
Some find in the magazines they read
Some find happiness is out of reach
No matter what they do 
Baby thats not me 
I found it in you
I found it in you---Lyrics submitted by ruth.
