I ain't your front man
cuz I ain't frontin', man
I just wanna flow like a stream
And when I let it go you know I sound like a dream
I ain't got styles,
Just got my soul
You know a train couldn't stop me when I'm on a roll
I just close my eyes
And I'm one with a lover mix
Open my mouth
and let it go like this

Same flannel shirt,
same pair of jeans,
since I was sixteen
settin' on your fence,
now I'm the scene
Dat's all right
Bend my hat like a trucker
Side-burns burnin' like a Kentucky Headhunter.
Still longing for the cheap thrill
Still sketchin like a black crow
cuz the fuzz is out ta kill
New sun risin'
You know we ain't afraid to die
New voice multiplyin'
So how's your world
You need a lift?
Come ta daddy.
Take your hit

Crazy laid back
Natural psycho
when I pick up the pen
I don't think
I just let it go
and make you realize,
ain't no jive
So baby bring on the waves and watch me ride
I do the shit for all
I give it all y'all
Cuz my mind and my soul is on call fo y'all

I ain't your front man,
I ain't you back man
I'm just a man, man
I'm just a man, man

I ain't your front man,
I ain't you back man
I'm just a man, man
I'm just a man, man
I'm just a man, man
I'm just a man, man
I'm just a man, man
I'm just a man, man

I ain't your front man,
I ain't your front man,
I ain't your front man,
We ain't your front men---Lyrics submitted by The Guvnah.
