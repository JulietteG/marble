I'm lost in sound as I lay my head
I'm a thousand miles from the home we've made
I heard your words as the call came through from that house of cards that I share with you

And I believe we both decide to take a stand or run and hide
And if you disagree them I'm the fool
And I always have to much to say
And lucidly I found my way
But it served me well
Coz I found you

And I won't let go on the heart I know
I see your smile in an open door as you wait for me and my return
With my feet here on this foreign soil
You know I'd walk those thousand miles so you and I we could be oh be together now

Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love we could be
And oh my love am I loud enough
Can you hear me where you are
And oh my love am I loud enough
Can you hear me where you are

Coz I won't let go on the heart I know
I see your smile in an open door as you wait for me and my return
With my feet here on this foreign soil
You know I'd walk those thousand
So you and I we could be oh be together now

Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love we could be oh be together now
Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love we could be

And when the nights are bitter cold
And the loneliness is out that door
Remember how we fought it off before
The candlelight you watch it burn
Like sailors wives 'til their men return
The ocean skies bring the home once more

And I won't let go on the heart I know
I see your smile in an open door as you wait for me and my return
With my feet here on this foreign soul you know I'd walk those thousand miles so you and I we could be oh be together now

Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love we could be oh be together now

Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love oh my love
Oh my love we could be
And oh my love am I loud enough
Can you here me where you are
And oh my love am I laud enough
Can you here me where you are---
