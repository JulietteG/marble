Shes the heart of an enemy
Youll find
Stationary by your side
Yeah shell search for a remedy
Last of her kind
As she breathes love into your life
Whats the price of a memory?
Broken lives
Scattered here by the graveside
Are we late for the ceremony?
Who decides?
Pray for time
Pray for time

Cause we all need a safe place to hide
Yeah we all need some love in our lives
And you know if they come for you
Ill be right here by your side
Cause we all need a safe place to hide

She stands for the innocent
Inside
Her heart beats
A crowd unknown
A scream breaks the interval
Of time
And one last words been thrown

And you know if you come for you
Ill be right here by your side
Cause we all need some love in our lives
Yeah we all need some love in our lives

Shine a light on your love
You be strong dont give up on your life
Shine a light on your love
You be strong dont give up on your life
Shine a light on your love
You be strong dont give up on your life
Shine a light on your love
You be strong dont give up on your life

Cause we all need a safe place to hide
And we all need some love in our lives---
