[Verse 1:]
Me and you
She says: "we're like an odd pair of shoes,
One slightly stylish and one slightly plain
one for the nightlife and one for the rain"

[Pre-Chorus:]
i never argue cause you never give in
no use in fighting cause I never win
there's no rules on this ship of fools
only lifeboats, survivors who know what to do

As I hold her tight
she trys to fight it
as she rolls her eyes
a slow submission
cause she knows I'm right
she dances
dance in the broad daylight

[Chorus:]
cause I can't say no
No I can't say no
I'm ten feet tall when she's by my side
but I can't say no 
to her smile

[Verse 2:]
Me and you
I think we found something old and new
Something ??? 
we're bulletproof
yet ???
never gonna end

[Pre-Chorus:]
i never argue cause you never give in
no use in fighting cause I never win
there's no rules on this ship of fools
only lifeboats, survivors who know what to do

As I hold her tight
she trys to fight it
as she rolls her eyes
a slow submission
cause she knows I'm right
she dances
dance in the broad daylight

[Chorus:]
cause I can't say no
No I can't say no
I'm ten feet tall when she's by my side
but I can't say no 
to her smile

can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no
(I can't say no) to her smile

[Bridge:]
why would want to not give you all that you need
love's unconditional without room for greed
so many ships before us have sunk to the ground
if you're afraid of heights, my friend
then don't look down

[Chorus:]
cause I can't say no
No I can't say no
I'm ten feet tall when she's by my side
but I can't say no 
to her smile---Lyrics submitted by L..
