I take you top down slowly I
I wanna see inside
See what makes you wild
See what drives me wild

Come a little closer to the other side
I love it when you go wild
I love it when you go wild

I said hey (hey)
I'm never wanna get enough
I'm never gonna get enough
Enough of you I love

I said hey (hey)
I'm never wanna get enough
I'm never gonna get enough
Enough of you I love

Your sweet caress 
What do you make me crawl
You know that I want it all
You know that I want it all

No words express these thoughts
that are in my mind
I love it when you go wild
I love it when you go wild

I said hey (hey)
I'm never gonna get enough
I'm never gonna get enough
Enough of you I love

I said hey (hey)
I'm never gonna get enough
I'm never gonna get enough
Enough of you I love
La
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Enough of you I love

You're bated breath 
You'll know it trust me in
I love that love within
I love this love within

I know there's a God above and she won't mind
'cause she's make you wild
yeah, she's make you wild

I said hey (hey)
I'm never gonna get enough
I'm never gonna get enough
Enough of you I love
(x2)

La
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Enough of you I love 
(x2)

I take you top down slowly I
I wanna see inside
See what makes you wild
See what drives me wild.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
