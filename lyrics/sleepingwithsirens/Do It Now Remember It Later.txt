Whoa oh oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh

Seen this place before
back when I was young and I had something more to prove
Now that I'm older I've seen all the things that I want
and I'm ready to make my move

We'll stare straight-faced, don't hesitate
See, why would we want to make you bastards wait
Thank god, I got this chance, now I can say
So now we'll say, we'll say
We're gonna do what we want

Remember when they said that what we want can never be done
When it all comes falling down
We'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Remember when they said that what we want can never be done
Well look who's laughing now
We'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Whoa oh oh, whoa oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh

Oh my, don't they hate to see us try
Come on say what you think
It won't mean a thing
In the end we're gonna be just fine

We'll stare straight-faced, don't hesitate
See, why would we want to make you bastards wait
Thank god, I got this chance, now I can say
So now we'll say, we'll say
We're gonna do what we want

Remember when they said that what we want can never be done
When it all comes falling down
We'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Remember when they said that what we want can never be done
Well look who's laughing now
We'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We'll do what we want
Right now
Come on, come on
With or without you
We will never regret that
Don't you cross the line
Don't you cross that line

We'll do what we want
Right now
Come on, come on
With or without you
We will never regret that
Don't you cross the line
Don't you cross that line

Remember when they said that what we want can never be done
When it all comes crashing down
We'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Remember when they said that what we want can never be done
When it all comes falling down
We'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Remember when they said that what we want can never be done
Well look who's laughing now
We'll do what we want to
Said we'll do what we want to
Yeah, yeah, yeah
