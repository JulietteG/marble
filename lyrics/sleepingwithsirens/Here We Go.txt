So here we go
You got one more chance to make it
Better not lose control, before everyone forgets your name.

This will always be mine 
So much more then just a dream to me 
I will never be fine, with letting you ruin everything
I will never fucking follow your lead
Give up on you, so you can take it out on me
I'm sorry that you had to watch your life come tumbling down.

Now it's my time and I'm ready to go.

Here we go, we got one more chance to make it
Better not lose control
Before everyone forgets your name.

Here we go, we got one more chance to make it
Better not lose control
Before everyone forgets your name.

You've always been the one to criticize
Me, because I'm not like you, you see 
The way you've been living your life
There's nothing there worth holding onto.

I will never fucking understand the hate you have for me
I only have one shot at this
The past is past, move on to better things.

Now is my time and I'm ready to go.

Here we go, we got one more chance to make it
Better not lose control
Before everyone forgets your name.

Here we go, we got one more chance to make it
Better not lose control
Before everyone, everyone forgets your name!

This is your time, you better take it
You better never let it go
This is your time, you better make it
It could be gone before you know.

So here we go, you got one more chance to make it
You better think before
You go and throw it all away!

Here we go, we got one more chance to make it
Better not lose control
Before everyone forgets your name.

Here we go, we got one more chance to make it
Better not lose control
Before everyone forgets your name---Lyrics submitted by Sabrina Quinn .
