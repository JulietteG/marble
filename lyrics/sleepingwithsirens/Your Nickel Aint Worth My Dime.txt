I found a love
That swept me off of my feet.
Found a baby, she's the finest thing
this boy has ever seen

She'd pick you up
and make you wanna fall hard
When i step out on the scene they shout,
"Oh my God!"

She's so unreal
She lets me take her home
Let my body love your body, baby
All night long!

I wanna write a song about you now!
yeah!
Something that would make you wanna start
I wanna write a song about you now!
yeah!
Something from the bottom of my heart!

I wanna take yuh home
I wanna take yuh home

Damn, This girl, Can't find nobody like her
She is everything i want
and i'd do anything for her.

I beg and beg and BEG
Make me believe that there is no one else i need
When you satisfy me

I'll take yuh home
we can be alone
And let my body show you lovi'n like it's never ever known!

I wanna write a song about you now!
yeah!
Something that would make you wanna start
I wanna write a song about you now!
yeah!
Something from the bottom of my heart

I wanna take you home tonight, alone
Take you places you've never known
Keep you coming right back for more
Keep you coming right back for more!

I wanna take you home tonight, alone
Take you places you've never known
Keep you coming right back for more
Keep you coming right back for more, more, more
yeah!!

I wanna write a song about you now!
yeah!
Something that would make you wanna start
I wanna write a song about you now!
yeah!
Something from the bottom of my heart

 I wanna take you home tonight, alone
Take you places you've never known
Keep you coming right back for more
Keep you coming right back

I wanna write a song about you now!
from the bottom of my heart
from the bottom of my heart---Lyrics submitted by Olivia.
