Yeah, yeah

Dont wake me up if Im sleeping this life away
Tell me that Ill never be good enough
Sometimes it hurts to think it could really be that way
It wont be that way

Im tired and Im lost
I dont wanna be found
I put my heart and my soul
And strength in this now

So forgive me cause I wont forget that
Yeah, this world has changed me
So you know when you ask me

Who are you now?
Did you say what you want?
Dont go back to the start
Im asking, who are you now?
Did they break you apart?
Wont you fight back for what you want?

Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly
Were gonna work it out

Yeah, yeah

Dont, dont, dont wake me up
Cause I hate who I am today
So come on, come on
And just take, take, take what you want
Is it now what were living for?
Were always wanting more

You made me hate my own reflection
Question every choice I make
So I could try to be perfect
But I will try to be fake

So forgive me cause I really could care less that
This world has changed me
So you know when you ask me

Who are you now?
Did you say what you want?
Dont go back to the start
Im asking, who are you now?
Did they break you apart?
Wont you fight back for what you want?

Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly
And sometimes you really live, youve gotta try
We can change it all together, in the end youre gonna find
That what we felt in our hearts was real the whole time
When you open up your eyes, I hope that you find
Who you are, who you are

Who are you now?
Who are you now?

Who are you now?
Did you say what you want?
Dont go back to the start
Im asking, who are you now?
Did they break you apart?
Wont you fight back for what you want?

Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly
Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly
Were gonna work it out---Lyrics submitted by Alexis Giganti.
