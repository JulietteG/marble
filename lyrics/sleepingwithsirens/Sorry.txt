I've been thinking lately about you and me,
And all the questions left unanswered,
How it all could be.

And I hope you know,
You never left my head,
And if I ever let you down,
I'm sorry.

Woah-ohh

Oh NO NO NO!

Woah-ohh

I see you around here lately,
You smile brighter than you should.
And me I've been so lonely,
I'm glad you're doing good.

Cause' I can't forget,
The way you used to be,
And if I ever let you down,
Well I'm sorry.

Woah-ohh

No I cant let you go...

And you know that you can take all of me,
I swear I will be better than before,
So sing it back.

Woah-ohh

I'm sorry for the things I've done,
Things I've done.

I'm sorry for the man I was,
and how I treated you.

I'm sorry for the things I've done,
Things I've done.

I'm sorry for the man I was,
and how I treated you.

Woah-ohh

No I can't let you go...

And you know that you can take all of me,
I swear I will be better than before,
So sing it back.

Woah-ohh

No I can't let you go...

I've been thinking lately about you and me,
And all the questions left unanswered,
How it all could be.

And I hope you know,
You never left my head,
And if I ever let you down,
I'm sorry. ---Lyrics submitted by Savacool.
