..In this place I'm so afraid of,
Bring me back to life, I swear I wont let you down,
Just one more chance I swear its all that I need,
Help me to wake up,

Is this really you?
I cant help but see no pretty things
In this dirty business that we do
Help me believe or make me better off
Help me to see, I'm better than I thought I was

Set me free oh

There's no safety this time,
I fall apart and it figures,
It's just the way I've always been,
There's no saving me this time,
I fall apart and it figures,
It's just the way I've always been,

Lets set the pace come on,

I'm on my knees praying for something,
Hoping for a change
I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees,
Wont you show me how to be?

Father set me free oh,

There's no safety this time
I fall apart and it figures
It's just the way I've always been
There's no saving me this time
I fall apart and it figures
It's just the way I've always been

Oh it just goes to show, how fragile this heart can be,
You'll put me back, you'll put me back,
All these pieces, these pieces of me

These things I'm so concerned with
They don't mean anything
These things I'm so concerned with
They don't mean anything
These things I'm so concerned with
They don't mean anything

My heart is with you, I'll love you til the very end

There's no safety this time
I fall apart and it figures
It's just the way I've always been
There's no saving me this time
I fall apart and it figures
It's just the way I've always been

These things I'm so afraid of they don't mean anything
These things I'm so afraid of they don't mean anything
They don't mean a thing---Lyrics submitted by Savannah.
