True friends lie underneath,
Their witty words I don't believe,
I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore,

Lie lie liar,
Liar you'll pay for your sins,
Lie lie liar,
Liar you'll pay for your sins,

So tell me how does it feel,
How does it feel to be like you,
I think your mouth should be quiet,
'Cause it never tells the truth now,
So tell me so tell me why,
Why does it have to be this way,
Why can't things ever change,

I'm falling over and over again,
From all the words that you have said,
It's written on my heart for everyone to see,
From the place I was,
To the place I am,
To the place I want to be,
From the mountains I've been climbing over and under and over,

So tell me how does it feel,
How does it feel to be like you,
I think your mouth should be quiet,
'Cause it never tells the truth,
So tell me so tell me why,
Why does it have to be this way,
Why can't things ever change,

So come down now,
Come down from your tower now,
Come down now,
From your tower oh,
Come down,
Come down from your tower,
Come down,
Come down from your tower,
Oh oh oh oh oh oooooh,
Come down,
Come down from your tower,
Oh oh oh oh oh oooooh,
(Come down come down from your tower),
(Oh oh oh oh oh oooooh),
(Come down come down from your tower),
(Oh oh oh oh oh oooooh).---Lyrics submitted by Layla Sykes.
