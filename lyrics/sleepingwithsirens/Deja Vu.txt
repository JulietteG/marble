You know I love it when your hair's pulled back
Ugh, it drives me crazy
You know I love it when you look like that
Tell me what you want to do.

You know I love to get the sheets messed up
Put your hands on my chest because it might get rough
Don't stop me baby 'til you've had enough
Come on, come on, come on!

With my hands all over you
There's nothing I can do
Feels like were having dj, dj vu
Got my hands all over you
There's nothing I can do
It's like we're having dj, dj vu!

Won't you tell me baby, what's your type?
Kiss you soft and slow, turn off the lights
I know sometimes you like to lose control
You love to rock and roll, yeah.

You know I love it when you talk like that
Just when I think that we're through you make me come right back
You're like a drug and I can't relax
I need more, more, more... Yeah!

With my hands all over you
There's nothing I can do
Feels like were having dj, dj vu
Got my hands all over you
There's nothing I can do
It's like we're having dj, dj vu!

Yeah, you make me feel so good!
Yeah, you make me feel so good!

Baby give me more, won't you give me more?
Won't you give me more! 
Oh, you know I need more, more, more!

With my hands all over you
There's nothing I can do
Feels like were having dj, dj vu
Got my hands all over you
There's nothing I can do
It's like we're having dj, dj vu!

Baby, give me more, wont you give me more?
Won't you give me more! 
Oh, you know I need more, more more!---Lyrics submitted by Summer Carlisle.
