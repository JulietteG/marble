A taste for blood
Wont hold them back
With nails that cut like razors
Hungry for flesh
See the undead hot on our trails they chase us
We need a place
Somewhere to hide
Where they wont think to go inside
Watch as your darkest fears return to life (your sins will find you out)

Dont bother sleeping without one eye open wide
There are creatures in the night to haunt you
Their arms are reaching out to hold you tight
Your demons come alive to chase you
(Ba dada dada da da da da da, dadda da da dadda da da)

No where to run theyre closing in on us
I can see the faces in the windows staring in at us

Theres no way to stop
What has been done
You felt the bite now youll be one
Dont tell your friends what youve become

Youre not the same
You can see it in your eyes
I can see it on your face
Your hoping for a taste

Do you feel your blood starting to boil beneath your skin?

Why is your stomach turning?
You know that it's the end!

This is the end

(No turning back now your under its spell)
(We have no choice, but to send your body back to hell)---
