Father, Father, Tell Me, Where have you been?
It's been hell not having you here
Ive been missing you so bad
and you dont seem to care
when I go to sleep at night, 
youre not there
when I go to sleep at night,
do you care?

Do you even miss us?
Your bottles, your mistress

I need to know, I need to know
why are you walking away?
Was it something I did? 
Did I make a mistake?
Cause, Im trying to deal with the pain	
I dont understand this, is this how it ends?

I will try to understand 
(Father, father, father...)

Father, Father, Tell Me, Where are you now?
It's been hell not having you
Last thing I heard, 
you were fed up, 
youre skipping town
with no note telling where

When I go to sleep at night, 
youre not there
when I go to sleep at night,
do you care?

I need to know , I need to know

why are you walking away?
Was it something I did ? 
did I make a mistake?
Cause, Im trying to deal with the pain	
I dont understand this, is this how it ends?

Why are you running away?
I dont understand this, is this how it ends?
Why are you running away?
Tell me please, tell me please, I need to know

Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?

Its been seven years wishing that youd drop the line
But I carry the thought along with you in my mind
but Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?

Family!

Why are you walking away?
Was it something I did ? 
Did I make a mistake?
Cause, Im trying to deal with the pain	
I dont understand this, is this how it ends?

Why are you running away?
I dont understand this, is this how it ends?
Why are you running away?
Tell me please, tell me please, I need to know

Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?---Lyrics submitted by Tashi.
