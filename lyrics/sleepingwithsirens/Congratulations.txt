Welcome to a brand new generation 
You don't know 
So let me help you understand 
You see, you try to build yourself a reputation 
So you can prove to everyone 
That you're the man 
So why is it us that make you feel so helpless? 
You better get it out while you still can 
Cuz when those lights go on around you 
And nobody gives a damn 
You're gonna wish that you had taken our advice 

I've been down, I've been out 
Now I can't keep my face off a cover 
That ain't what it's about 
You still have so much left to learn 

Congratulations 
They say you're the man 
Congratulations 
You see I do what you can't 
And until they go and take my name off of the shelves 
Congratulations, we're gonna give you hell 

(Get 'em Matty) 

They try to do it like me 
But they do it all wrong 
I'll pass the torch when someone better comes along 
Congratulations to every label that ever turned me down 
Me and my top 20 record aren't too worried about it now 
I hope this lesson taught is a lesson learned 
Now go and bury your head while me and Kell rule the world! 

Congratulations 
They say you're the man (yes I am) 
Congratulations 
You see I do what you can't 
And until they go and take my name off of the shelves 
Congratulations, let's give 'em hell 

Could you please give us the spotlight 
Cuz I have something to say 
You may not like the subject 
But I'll say this anyway 
We're so sick of all this so-called 
Shitty music that you play 
So could you please do us a favor 
Stay the fuck out of our way 

Congratulations 
They say you're the man 
Congratulations 
You see I do what you can't 
And until they go and take my name off of the shelves 
Please, cuz I need to make more room for myself 
Congratulations---Lyrics submitted by Savacool.
