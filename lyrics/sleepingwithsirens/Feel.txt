And I feel
I feel so alive again 
Yeah, oh I feel 
I feel so alive again 

I used to be a ghost 
Floating aimlessly
So they couldn't see
What I think hurts the most 
I felt like it made me, hate me 
But I won't apologize for being different 
I can be who I am, and yeah
I felt so dead inside 
But now I feel so alive, for the first time

And I feel
I feel so alive again 
Yeah, oh I feel 
I feel so alive again 

Is there somewhere I could go?
Oh, I would go there
Take me anywhere 
Cuz this person I don't know 
The one that's staring back at me 
It's not who I wanna be
But I won't apologize
For being different 
I can, can be who I am 
While they cover up the dead inside 
I feel so alive, for the first time

And I feel
I feel so alive again 
Yeah, oh I feel 
I feel so alive again 

Could you help me find 
Could you help me find a way?
Could you help me find
Help me find a way 

And I feel
I feel so alive again 
Yeah, oh I feel 
I feel so alive again 

You'll never bring me down
You'll never tear me apart 
I am alive
I am alive again---Lyrics submitted by Ivette.
