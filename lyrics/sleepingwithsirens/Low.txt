Should I trust my heart or my head?
I wish that I could just replay the thoughts of things I never said.
Should I use my heart or my head?
I wish that I could just turn back the time and start over again.
Ive waited on the longest time I better say this now.

You make me feel low.
Dont make me feel low.
Cause Ive tried so hard to convince myself its okay that I feel this way. You make me feel low.
Dont make me feel low.
If I cant have you Id be by myself cause you know I need you so.
Dont make me, dont make me feel low.

So tell me what do you say?
I spent six years to figure out how to love, just to throw it all away.
And she said maybe if you been a little bit smarter.
Maybe if you tried hard enough I wouldnt question why I should have stayed. You expect me to come back around.
Make sure you understand.

You make me feel low.
Dont make me feel low.
Cause I tried so hard to convince myself its okay that I feel this way.
You make me feel low.

Dont make me, dont make me, dont make me walk out the door dont you throw it away.
Dont make me, dont make me, I'm leaving for good and Im not coming back again.
Im not coming back again.

When I said it was over I meant it!
But now I cant let you go!
Still I cant except that you make me feel so!
You make me feel so!
