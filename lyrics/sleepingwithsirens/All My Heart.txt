There's so many things that I could say
But I'm sure it would come out all wrong
You got something that I can't explain,
Still try and try and let you know

That first summer we spent's one we'll never forget,
Looking for any kind of reason to escape all the mess that
We thought was what made us 
Ain't it funny now? We can see 
We're who we're meant to be

You still have all of my
You still have all of my
You still have all my heart

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh...

There's too many times I have to say
I could have been better and stronger for you and me
You always make me feel okay
Those late summers we spent, stay up talking all night
I'd ask "you think we'd ever make it?"
You'd say "I'm sure if it's right"
Ain't it funny to think just how stupid I used to be
Hope you always believe

You still have all of my
You still have all of my
You still have all my heart

You still have all of my
You still have all of my
You still have all my heart

Let them talk and talk and talk
Let them say what they want
We will laugh at the thought they don't know what we've got
Every year that goes by, a year older we are
You'll still be beautiful then, bless your beautiful heart

They'll talk and talk and talk
How crazy is it?
Someone could waste their whole life, helplessly,
Just patiently waiting for a love like you and me

You still have all of my
You still have all of my
You still have all my heart

You still have all of my heart
You still have all of my (you still have all of my heart)
You still have all of my (you still have all of my heart)
You still have all of my heart (you still have all of my heart)

You still have all of my(I've been waiting my whole life) 
You still have all of my
(For someone to save me still can't believe that you're mine)
You still have all of my heart---Lyrics submitted by Melissa.
