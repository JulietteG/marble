I've got the whole world in front of me
I'm not letting go till I say

This is my life
I've got it all right in front of me
I won't let it go
There's no way
This is our time
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

I'm losing control
My head is alright
I can't shake the thought
Of me losing my mind

Been away for three days
Won't sleep till I've done
All it is I'm living for
Now I will show you
All that I'm made of

This is my life
I've got the whole world in front of me
I'm not letting go till I say
This is my life
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

I made up my mind
This time I know, know
It all comes down to this
This is our time
This is our time
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

For all of the times I spent waiting
For all of the long nights alone
I finally know what it means to
Have something I can call my own

The show must go on
So we'll show you
All that we're made of

This is my life
I've got the whole world in front of me
I'm not letting go till I say
This is my life
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

I made up my mind
This time I know, know
It all comes down to this
This is our time
This is our time
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

Your soul is down!
I'll break the dawn!
I took the stage!
And now we're taking back tonight!

I made up my mind!
This is my life!

This is my life
I've got the whole world in front of me
I'm not letting go till I say
This is my life
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

I made up my mind
This time I know, know
It all comes down to this
This is our time
This is our time
Don't slip away
Don't slip away

I made up my mind!
This is my life!---Lyrics submitted by Alexis Giganti.
