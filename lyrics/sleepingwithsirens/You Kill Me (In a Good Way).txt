I know that hope weighs on your mind, lost within the seams,
it seems like we lose ourselves in between.
But the harder things become, the harder you push away.
Oh baby, yeah baby, it kills me.

You said it, you said it
I'll take you at your word.
These promises that you can't keep,
it's getting harder to hold on.
You said it, you said it
don't ever let me fall.
Don't give up because you're losing
(you haven't lost).

In time you'll find that we can sober up,
clean up any dirt so we can open up.
These wounds have been open for forever now.
Come on, be strong.
Your mind has gotten the best of you.
You've done enough and you are enough.
Let's fall asleep tonight,
I'll hold you close and show you you're not broken.

You said it, you said it
I'll take you at your word.
These promises that you can't keep,
it's getting harder to hold on.
You said it, you said it
don't ever let me fall.
Don't give up because you're losing

(Hold on)

Don't you think if it's meant to be, it will be?
Don't you think things will work out eventually?
Hold on.

You said it, you said it
I'll take you at your word.
These promises that you can't keep,
it's getting harder to hold on.
You said it, you said it
don't ever let me fall.
Don't give up because you're losing.---Lyrics submitted by Savannah.
