Even if there's no where left to go 
I'll take you there, I'll take you there 

And if it ever feels like there is no where left to turn 
I'll take you there 
Always be there 
Please take me there 

I've watched myself struggle with this fear of falling down 
Cus I've seen a silhouette of me who is this stranger I've become 
Who is this man that I've become? 

Even if there's no where left to go 
I'll take you there 
I'll take you there 
And if it ever feels like there is no where left to turn 
I'll take you there 
Always be there 
Please take me there 

I lost myself 
I questioned if I had the strength to move 
Cus I get up and then I fall back down 
I look up and there's nobody around 
It's quiet and I hate the sound 
So quiet and I hate the sound 
How could I let myself come to this? 
I'll take one more drink and then I'll be dismissed 
I'm left to walk this world alone 
I like it better on my own 
For all the things I've done 
Who is this man that I've become? 

Even if there's no where left to go 
I'll take you there 
I'll take you there 
And if it ever feels like there is no where left to turn 
I'll take you there 
Always be there 
Please take me there 

I'll take you there 
I'll take you there 
And if it ever feels like there is no where left to turn 
I'll take you there 
Always be there 
Please take me there 

Even if there's no where left to go 
I'll take you there 
I'll take you there 
And if it ever feels like there is no where left to turn 
I'll take you there 
Always be there 
Please take me there---Lyrics submitted by Savacool.
