Oh, my stomachs tied in knots
Im afraid of what Ill find if you want to talk tonight
Ooh ooh
See the problem isnt you, its me, I know
I can tell, Ive seen it time after time
And Ill push you away (mmm)
I guess you're afraid, oh, no

And I can't live without you now
Oh-oh
I cant even live with myself
Oh-oh-oh
And I can't live without you now
Oh-oh
And I dont want nobody else
Oh-oh-oh

I only have myself to blame
But do you think we can start again?
'Cause I can't live without you

Oh, my stomachs tied in knots
Im afraid of what Ill find if I see you again tonight
Ooh ooh
See the problem isnt you, its me, I know
I do this every single time
Ill push you away (ooh)
I guess you're afraid, oh, no

And I can't live without you now
Oh-oh
I cant even live with myself
Oh-oh-oh
And I can't live without you now
Oh-oh
And I dont want nobody else
Oh-oh-oh

I only have myself to blame
But do you think we can start again?
I only have myself to blame
But do you think we can start again?
I only have myself to blame
But do you think we can start again?
I only have myself to blame
Let's start again
Let's start again

I can't live without you
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

And I can't live without you now
Oh-oh
I can't even live with myself
Oh-oh-oh
I can't live without you now
Oh-oh
And I don't want nobody else
Oh-oh-oh

'Cause I can't live without you now
Oh-oh
I can't even live with myself
Oh-oh-oh
And I can't live without you now
Oh-oh
'Cause I don't want nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else

I can't live without you
Oh oh ---Lyrics submitted by Bailey Rogers.
