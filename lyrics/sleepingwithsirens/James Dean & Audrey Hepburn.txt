Stay for Tonight
If you want to, I can show you
What my dreams are made of, As I'm dreaming of your face
I've been away for a long time, (such a long time)
And I miss you there, I can't imagine being anywhere else
I can't imagine being anywhere else but here~

How the hell did you ever pick me?
Honestly, cause I could sing you a song, 
But I don't think words can express your beauty!

It's singing to me,
How the hell did we end up like this?
You bring out the Beast in me
Fell in love from the moment we kissed,
Since the we've been history~

They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need 
Please stay as long as you  need.
Can't promise that things won't be broken,
But I swear that I will never leave
Please stay forever with me

(If you want to I could show you,
(If you want to I could show you)

It goes to show, I hope that you know that you are,
What my dreams are made of
And I can't fall asleep, I lay in my bed awake at night.
And I'll fall in love, You'll fall in love, 
It could mean everything, everything to me

(Oooo,ooo, oo)

This could mean everything to me~

They say that love is forever,
Your forever is all that I need.
Please stay as long as you need,
Can't promise that things won't be broken.
But I swear that I will never leave,
Please stay forever..

The way that we are,
Is the reason I stay
As long as your here with me
I know I'll be okay.

(small guitar part)

(La, da, da, 
La, da, da, 
Da, da x3)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohohh~)

(Dida La Duda La La La dada x3)

(Oh Oh Oh Ooooooooohohoh)

They say that love is forever,
Your forever is all that I need
Please stay..Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken,
But I swear that I will never leave
Please stay forever with me

~It goes to show, 
I hope that you know that you are 
what my dreams are made of~ (x2)

Please stay...Please stay as long as you need

~They say that love is forever, 
Your forever is all that I need~(x2)

Please stay forever with me.---Lyrics submitted by Mika Flower.
