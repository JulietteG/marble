Aahhh yeah !
I can't believe what is in front of me
The water's rising up to my knees 
And I can't figure out
How the hell I wound up here
Everything seemed okay when I started out the other day 
Then the rain came pouring down
And now I'm drowning in my fears
And as I watch the setting sun 
I wonder if I'm the only one 

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody tries to put some love on the line
And everybody feels a broken heart sometimes 
And even when I'm scared I have to try to fly
Sometimes I fall
But I've seen it done before 
I got to step outside these walls

I've got no master plan to help me out 
Or make me stand up for 
All the things that I really want
You had me to afraid to ask
And as I look ahead of me
Cry and pray for sanity

[chorus]

These walls can't be my haven
These walls can't keep me safe here
Now i guess I've got to let them down

'Cause everybody tries to put some love on the line
And everybody feels a broken heart sometimes, yeah, and
Even when I'm scared i have to try to fly
Sometimes I fall
But I've seen it done before

I got to break out...
I got to break out...
I got to step outside these walls
Love outside these walls
I feel my heart breaking
But its a brand new day
And I'm going down
'Cause I'm stepping out
I'm stepping outside 
These walls
{I've seen it done before..and I'm walking on, I'll walk it on, oh I'm moving on, hoooo, give me some room , climb outside these walls , right outside these walls. ) ---Lyrics submitted by katie.
