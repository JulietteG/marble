You seem so afraid,
Afraid you'll regret, regret getting closer and connected,
To me,
And I feel like that too but I'm scared,
Scared you'll leave while you still feel you can,
So I'll just wait and see,
So I'll just wait and see,
And see...yeah.

[Chorus]

That our eyes say worlds we'll leave unspoken
When we're trying to be careful,
And words can be so confusing when were trying to be careful,
But not too careful.

Fear, it has its place,
Folded in squares,
Squarely tucked in the pack pocket of our minds,
And yes its reckless to laugh
Pointless to decided,
Just let your world collide,
With mine,
Lets not wait and see,

[Chorus]
That our eyes say worlds we'll leave unspoken,
When we're trying to be careful,
And words can be so confusing,
When we're trying to be careful,
But not too careful,

What's the average number of times people feel this way in a lifetime,
Lets not waste more time,

[Chorus]
Let our eyes say worlds we'll leave unspoken,
When we're trying to be careful,
And words can be so confusing,
When we're trying to be careful,
Not too careful,
Not too careful.---
