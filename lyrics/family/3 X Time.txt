There have been many blue yesterdays
Passed me by
And as I sit here my time goes fast
As I re-enact the past
The past is gone but always very near
Memories good and bad that I know dear

There have been many long nights
Awake after days
And thought of time and all of its ways
And the melody that it plays
The things I've done and all the friends I've met
Now looking back there's nothing I regret---Lyrics submitted by Dempsey.
