There's a place that I love to run and play
There's a place that I sing new songs of praise

Dancin' with my Father God in fields of grace
Dancin' with my Father God in fields of grace

There's a place that I lose myself within
There's a place that I find myself again

Dancin' with my Father God in fields of grace
Dancin' with my Father God in fields of grace

There's a place where religion finally dies
There's a place that I lose my selfish pride

Dancin' with my Father God in fields of grace
Dancin' with my Father God in fields of grace
Dancin' with my Father God in fields of grace
Dancin' with my Father God in fields of grace

I love my Father, my Father loves me
I dance for my Father, my Father sings over me
I love my Father, my Father loves me
I dance for my Father, my Father sings over me
And nothing, nothing, nothing can take that away from me---Lyrics submitted by Brooke.
