Let me get that
Let me get that, oooh
I get it when I get that, ooh
I spend it when I whip that

Flossin' on them haters
Its that boss - the bitch, that caker
Tricks thats born to tip that shaker
He's forfeiting all that paper
Niggas coughing off that 8th of-
I want to hit them vapors
Its that sporty bitch that game 'em
They calling me Super Sega, hit that

Im just really out here livin'
Something like the new edition
They say Im poison, whats the difference?

Holla playa hello

Pretty eyes and long extensions
They smiling in all them pictures

It's diamonds, we diamond district
Get that ice, nigga, ice, nigga
Bitch want to freeze like white winter
She need the G's, that price went up
She need to see that bright shimmer
He want to see that nice
Want to fit that slice, want to see that spice simmer
She want it with that white nigga
Peachy-pinky-piped nigga
Be's what it be's, little breeze by the sea

XOXO fine, scissor sister, 69 whip that
I get it when I get that
I spend it when I whip that

Let me get that

When I hit that, let me hit that, oooh
I get it when I get that, oooh

Im just really out here living
Something like a New Edition
They say Im poison, whats the difference?
