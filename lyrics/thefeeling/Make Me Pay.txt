The days fly by
Just like birds in the sky
And I can't take it anymore
No, I can't take it anymore

So I smile, smile, smile
'Cause you think it's my style
But I won't fake it anymore
No, I won't fake it anymore

'Cause I am on fire but it feels so cold
I couldn't be higher but I feel so low
And I don't know why I got to feel this way
And I don't know why they've got to make me pay
See, honey I know that I'm all alone
And honey that's fine 'cause I made it so
But I don't know why I got to feel this way
And I don't know why they've got to make me pay
Make me pay

See I got shoes in greens, greys, yellows and blues
Got the full moon shining through the window in my room
But that can't help me anymore
No, that can't help me anymore
See I've got friends that I would die for
A home that I would die for
All the stuff a fine lady could require or desire for
But that can't help me anymore
No that can't help me anymore

So I smile, smile, smile
'Cause you think it's my style
But I won't fake it anymore
No, I won't fake it anymore

'Cause I am on fire but it feels so cold
I couldn't be higher but I feel so low
And I don't know why I got to feel this way
And I don't know why they've got to make me pay
See, honey I know that I'm all alone
And honey that's fine 'cause I made it so
But I don't know why I got to feel this way
And I don't know why they've got to make me pay
Make me pay

'Cause I am on fire but it feels so cold
I couldn't be higher but I feel so low
And I don't know why I got to feel this way
And I don't know why they've got to make me pay
See, honey I know that I'm all alone
And honey that's fine 'cause I made it so
But I don't know why I got to feel this way
And I don't know why they've got to make me pay
Make me pay---Lyrics submitted by Natasha.
