You could have bowed out gracefully 
But you didn't 
You knew enough to know to leave well enough alone 
But you wouldn't 
I drive myself crazy trying to stay out of my own way 
The messes that i made 
But my secrets are so safe 
The only one who gets me 
Yeah, you get me 
It's amazing to me 

How every day 
every day 
every day 
You save my life 

I come around all broken down and crowded out 
And you're comfort 
Sometimes the place I go is so deep and dark and desperate 
I don't know 
I don't know 

How every day 
every day 
every day 
You save my life 

Sometimes I swear I don't know if I am coming or going 
But you always say something without even knowing 
That I am hanging onto your words with all my might 
And it's alright 
Yeah I am alright 
For one more night 
Every day 

Every day 
Every day 
Every Every Every day 
You save me 
You save me oh oh oh oh 
Na na na na na na-ah 
Every day 
Every day 



Every day 
You save my life---Lyrics submitted by Jill.
