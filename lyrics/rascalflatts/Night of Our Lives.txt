Seventeen don't seem that far
I'd pick you up in my old car
And I still see us, there we are
Fallin' hard like a couple of stars
On the night of our lives

We parked it down in that empty lot
Drank that beer your brother bought
Your kiss was cool and that air was hot
We pondered life and tied the knot
On the night of our lives

My little blue eyed blue jean girl
We took that Chevy for a whirl
Innocence and butterflies
We left them both behind
On the night of our lives

We were young and we were green
But we grew up fast in that back seat
The sweetest eyes I'd ever seen
Tellin' me this was gonna be
The night of our lives

Now we knew tomorrow I had to fly
Off to Nashville to say goodbye
Those tears were real in my eyes
We held each other one last time
On the night of our lives

My little blue eyed blue jean girl
We took that Chevy for a whirl
I look back and I still see
The way you looked at me

Oh, hello kisses sweet as wine
I was yours and you were mine
Innocence and butterflies
We left them both behind
On the night of our lives

My little blue eyed blue jean girl
We took that Chevy for a whirl
I look back and I still see
The way you looked at me

Hello kisses sweet as wine
I was yours and you were mine
Do I ever cross your mind
Do you think of me sometimes
On the night of our lives

Seventeen don't seem that far
I'd pick you up in my old car ---Lyrics submitted by Tamra.
