Come on ladies, it's time to
Pop that top
And fellas, I know you're
Ready to rock
We went crazy, cooped
Up all winter long
And school is out so let's 
Get it on
Flip flop tan and some white sand
I know the perfect spot

Well, the sunset better set soon
So we can get in the mood
Things start getting all heated up
When it starts getting cool - yeah

Summer nights
Everybody are you with me
Let that igloo cooler
Mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feelin sexy
Holler if you're ready
For some summer nights

Come on - Oh, yeah, yeah

Now fellas, you better watch your step
Don't them teeny french bikinis
Make you lose your breath
Back to the ladies
Y'all keep doin y'alls thing
'Cause everything about you
Makes me wanna scream

The sun is getting low
There it goes
Here we go, here comes the moon
Things start getting all heated up
When it starts getting cool - yeah

Summer nights
Everybody are you with me
Let that igloo cooler
Mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feelin sexy
Holler if you're ready
For some summer nights

Oh, it's a party down in Padre
Big bonfire on the beach
It's Coronas in Daytona, Y'all
Well, it's wild and it's free

Summer nights
Everybody are you with me
Let that igloo cooler
Mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feelin sexy
Holler if you're ready
For some summer nights

Summer nights
Everybody are you with me
Let that igloo cooler
Mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights
Everybody's feelin sexy
Holler if you're ready
For some summer nights

Yeah, yeah are you ready
For some summer nights
Everybody's feeling sexy
Summer nights---Lyrics submitted by Arielle.
