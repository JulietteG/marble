What'd you say girl we do somethin' crazy 
Quit putting it off, you know what I'm sayin' 
Ain't like it ain't gonna happen, forever's a given 
It's already written, who we kiddin' baby, c'mon 
The stars can't line up any straighter 
Let's do it now and think about it later 

Why wait another minute 
For somethin' we should've done yesterday 
I know a little church 
With a preacher who can hook us up right away 
Love don't need a reason 
Baby, I don't see how I could love you any more than I do today 
So why wait 

Now I love your mama, let's save her some trouble 
And your daddy won't mind if we save him a bundle 
Girl it just so happens that ring that you wanted 
Well guess what, I bought it, it's in my pocket baby, c'mon 
Let's get it done, let's get it on your left hand 
This is me, girl, poppin' the question 

Why wait another minute 
For somethin' we should've done yesterday 
I know a little church 
With a preacher who can hook us up right away 
Love don't need a reason 
Baby, I don't see how I could love you any more than I do today 
So why wait 

Let's do somethin' crazy 
As crazy as what you make me 

Why wait another minute 
Wait another minute, c'mon 
I know a little church 
With a preacher who can hook us up right away 
Love don't need a reason 
Baby, I don't see how I could love you any more than I do today 
So why wait 

Why wait 

What'd you say girl we do somethin' crazy---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
