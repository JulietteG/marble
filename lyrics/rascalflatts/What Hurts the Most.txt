I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house 
That dont bother me 
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out 
Im not afraid to cry every once in a while 
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me 
There are days every now and again I pretend Im OK 
But thats not what gets me 

What hurts the most 
Was being so close 
And having so much to say 
And watching you walk away 
And never knowing 
What could have been 
And not seeing that loving you 
Is what I was tryin to do 

Its hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go 
But Im doin It 
Its hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and Im alone 
Still Harder 
Getting up, getting dressed, livin with this regret 
But I know if I could do it over 
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart 
That I left unspoken 

What hurts the most 
Is being so close 
And having so much to say (much to say) 
And watching you walk away 
And never knowing 
What could have been 
And not seeing that loving you 
Is what I was trying to do, oh. 

What hurts the most

Not seeing that loving you 
Thats what I was trying to do---
