When I lose my smile
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Cant take a breath without getting sick
Ive had enough with this concrete jungle
I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go beyond the pavement

[Chorus]
You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah youre gettin close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
Til you hear a banjo

It aint on no map
And Im glad it isnt
Leave the phone and the GPS,
Those satellites aint found it yet,
Got our own little piece of heaven hidden

[Chorus]
Yeah, you gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah youre gettin close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
Til you hear a banjo

You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah youre gettin close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go and you go and you go

Oooh hoo

Til you hear that banjo
Kick it

You gotta go deep
Way on back
Oh oh oh
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
Oh oh oh
Four wheel drive when you run out of road
Oh oh oh
And you go and you go, and you go
Til you hear that, til you hear that
Til you hear that banjo ---
