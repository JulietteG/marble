Starin' at you takin' off your makeup 
Wondering why you even put it on 
I know you think you do but baby you don't need it 
Wish that you could see what I see it when it's gone 
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova 
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder 

Wait, baby don't move, right there it is 
T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch 
That river was cold but we gave love a chance 
Yeah, yeah for me 
You don't look a day over Fast Cars and Freedom 
That sunset river bank first time feeling 

Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me 
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back 
I'm on that gravel road, look at me 
On my way to pick you up you're standing on the front porch 
Looking just like that remember that 

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova 
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder 

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova 
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder 
You don't look a day over Fast Cars and Freedom 
That sunset river bank first time feeling---
