Front of the line, straight past the bouncer
Lookin' so fine that the band announced ya
Gotcha tight jeans on and your hair done right
All your girlfriends say we throwin' down tonight
Let me guess, somebody done you wrong
And you're lookin' for a way to get your feel good on
Get some pictures on the Instagram and show him what he's missin'
Straight no chaser, girl on a mission

Mmm, baby I could be your payback
Hey, gonna help you get your sway back
Take ya to the dance floor, I'ma lean ya way back
Yeah, I'ma lean ya way back

Gonna have a real good time
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl, put it on mine
We can show him what he can't have
If you wanna play that game
Yeah, baby I can be your payback

Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

I bet he's sittin' at home all alone in the dark
Probably textin' like mad, wants to know where you are
'Cause he didn't even know what he had 'til he lost it
Should have known runnin' around was gonna cost him
No way that girl is as pretty as you
I never even seen her but I know that it's true
If he was even half a man he wouldn't have blown it
Thinkin' 'bout it that way feels good don't it

Mmm, baby I could be your payback
Hey, gonna help you get your sway back
Take ya to the dance floor, I'ma lean ya way back
Yeah, I'ma lean ya way back

Gonna have a real good time
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl, put it on mine
We can show him what he can't have
If you wanna play that game
Yeah, baby I can be your payback

Da da da da da da da
Let me be your payback
Da da da da da da da
Gonna help ya get your sway back
Da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da
He's gonna hate that
I can be your p-p-p-p-payback
I can be your p-p-p-p-payback
I can be your p-p-p-p-payback
I can be your p-p-p-p-payback
Woo yeah, woo, ah yeah ---
