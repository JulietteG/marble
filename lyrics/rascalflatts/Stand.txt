You feel like a candle in a hurricane 
Just like a picture with a broken frame 
Alone and helpless 
Like you've lost your fight 
But you'll be alright, you'll be alright 

'Cause when push comes to shove 
You taste what you're made of 
You might bend, 'til you break 
'Cause it's all you can take 
On your knees you look up 
Decide you've had enough 
You get mad, you get strong 
Wipe your hands, shake it off 
Then you stand, 
Then you stand 

Life's like a novel 
With the end ripped out 
The edge of a canyon 
With only one way down 
Take what you're given before it's gone 
And start holding on, keep holding on 

'Cause when push comes to shove 
You taste what you're made of 
You might bend 'til you break 
'Cause it's all you can take 
On your knees you look up 
Decide you've had enough 
You get mad, you get strong 
Wipe your hands, shake it off 
Then you stand, 
Yeah, then you stand 

Every time you get up 
And get back in the race 
One more small piece of you 
Starts to fall into place 
Oh 

Yeah, then you stand, 
Yeah, yeah, baby 
Woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo 

Then you stand, yeah, yeah---
