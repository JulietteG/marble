They tried their best to drag him out 
of a court house down in Montgomery.
And now they wanna kick him out of school
and take him off our money.
They can take those word off of paper and stone
but he ain't gone, no.

[chorus] He ain't the leavin' kind
He'd never walk away
Even from those who don't believe 
and wanna leave him behind
he ain't the leavin' kind.

She stayed mad at him for a lot of years
for takin' her husband.
Started loosing' her faith and thinking' that 
her life meant nothing.
But when she looks at those kids she raised
all by her self she knows she had some help
yea she knows

[chorus]
no matter what you do
no matter where you go 
he's always right there with you
even from those who don't believe 
and wanna leave him behind
he ain't the leavin kind---Lyrics submitted by Savanna.
