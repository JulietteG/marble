I miss you so much
Your light, your smile, and your way
And everything about us
Though you're gone, you're still here
In my heart and my tears
Yeah, you sure left your mark
And we were just getting started

It wasn't long enough,
It wasn't long enough together
But it was long enough,
Yeah, it was long enough to last forever

Sometimes I get so mad
I scream, I swear at this
Cause this isn't how we planned it
I sit here in a cold room
Prayin, waitin on you
To run back through that door 
To the way it was before you left

It wasn't long enough,
It wasn't long enough together
But it was long enough,
Yeah, it was long enough to last forever

I feel cheated, defeated
Can't believe that you're gone
Oh, it was wrong
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough

No, it wasn't long enough
It wasn't long enough together
But it was long enough
Yeah, it was long enough to last,
To last, to last forever

It wasn't long enough,
It wasn't long enough,
It wasn't long enough.

No, it wasn't long enough

It wasn't long enough,
It wasn't long enough,
It wasn't long enough.
It wasn't long enough,
It wasn't long enough,
It wasn't long enough.---Lyrics submitted by Arielle.
