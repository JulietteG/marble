I hope that days come easy and the moments pass slow,
And each road leads you where you want to go.
And if you're faced with a choice, and you have to choose,
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you.
And if one door opens to another door closed,
I hope you keep on walkin' till you find the window,

If it's cold outside,
Show the world the warmth of your smile,
More than anything, more than anything...

My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it,
To your dreams stay big and your worries stay small,
You never need to carry more than you can hold.
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too,
Yeah, this is my wish.

I hope you never look back, but you never forget,
All the ones who love you in the place you left,
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret,
And you help somebody every chance you get.
Oh, you find God's grace in every mistake,
And you always give more than you take.

But more than anything, yeah, more than anything,

My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it,
To your dreams stay big and your worries stay small,
You never need to carry more than you can hold.
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,
I hope you know somebody loves you
And wants the same things too,
Yeah, this is my wish.
