I come from California
Where you say no one grows old
and y'all drive to fast.
But you say it so slow.
In that southern style, baby
That always drives me crazy.
And I start to laugh.

Cause, I have never been to Memphis
but if you're there
I will pack my bag, and go.
Cause I don't care, if it never rains here,
the suns always shining.
I have never met a girl like you
and I'm tired of trying.
I have never been to Memphis.

You're all crazy about Jesus (Amen)
back where you're from.
You got baptized in rivers
where the deep waters run.
That's alright by me,
yeah I love that you believe in
something you can't touch,
something you can't see.

Cause, I have never been to Memphis
but if you're there
I will pack my bag, and go.
Even though, never been afraid of flying
but I am afraid to fall.
I've been painting by numbers while you're
just splashing them on the wall.
And I see the colors running
it lets me know I'm headed home.

After all
(After all, after all)
After all
(After all, after all)
I've got to get myself there.
(I have never been)
And I've got to get myself there.
(I have never been)

Cause I have never been to Memphis
but if you're there.
I'm on my way
(oh, oh oh oh)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)---
