Its just another simple 
voice mail message
I'll pick you up and we'll do 
dinner by the fire
and we'll just watch it snow 
its from a year ago 
baby, i love you 
and cant wait to see you tonight
ive been thinking about you
all day long
she pushes nine to save
she still cant erase 'cause
CHORUS
it makes her feel close
makes her smile
its like hes with her almost
till the tears take over
shes still in hell 
but she tells herself
shes ready to let him go
cause that makes her feel close

its just a worn out
notre dame t-shirt
shes gotten mad
and tried to throw that thing away
at least a hundred times
but shes got it on tonight
he used to wear it on the weekend 
just running around 
probably forgot he even left it 
behind
she says it keeps her warm
oh, but its so much more
(repeat chorus)
to saying goodbye getting
on with her life
maybe give love another try
one more try
oh, one more try
(repeat chorus)
its just a worn out notre
damw t-shirt
shes gotten mad and tried
to throw that thing away 
at least a hundred times
but shes got it on tonight---Lyrics submitted by nicole.
