Girl, what's your favorite song
I'll be your DJ tonight

Mmm, the way you hold that glass with your fingertips
I wish I was the whiskey upon your lips
Never wanted somethin' so bad
You started dancin' like, man
Got me checkin' you out again
Singin' all the wrong words with your friends
When I finally caught you starin' back

I've been thinkin' of words to say if you walked up to me right now
I've been starin' at you so long that my drinks gettin' watered down
I walked up to you like

You don't have to say a word
I see the look in your eyes
Girl, what's your favorite song
I'll be your DJ tonight
And we'll keep rockin' 'til the last call
Feelin' alright, yeah, yeah
Now you're callin' me baby
While I keep on fallin', yeah
And I think it's more than the just the liquor talkin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Like a diamond
The way you're singin' Sweet Caroline
Bom, bom, bom
It's perfect timing
I've been waitin' for you my whole life

Girl you got me buzzin' so hard
I don't even look around, oh no
And we've been dancin' here so long
That I think you should know by now

You don't have to say a word
I see the look in your eyes
Girl, what's your favorite song
I'll be your DJ tonight
And we'll keep rockin' 'til the last call
Feelin' alright, yeah, yeah
Now you're callin' me baby
While I keep on fallin', yeah
And I think it's more than the just the liquor talkin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You don't have to say a word, baby
Oh slide a little closer, little lady

You don't have to say a word
I see the look in your eyes
Girl, what's your favorite song
I'll be your DJ tonight
And we'll keep rockin' 'til the last call
Feelin' alright, yeah, yeah
Now you're callin' me baby
While I keep on fallin', yeah
And I think it's more than the just the liquor talkin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You don't have to say a word
I see the look in your eyes
Girl, what's your favorite song
I'll be your DJ tonight ---Lyrics submitted by Tamra.
