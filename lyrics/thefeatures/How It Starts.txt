Give a little bit of your love to me.
Put it right there on my cheek.
Give a little bit your love to me.
That's all I really need.

You could save me,
Keep me from harm.
I'll be your baby.
Take me in your arms.

That's how it starts.
That's how it starts.
That's how it starts.

Give a little bit of your love to me.
Gimme something I can keep.
Give a little bit of your love to me.
We've got possibilities.

If you need me,
I will run
And completely
Thy will be done.

That's how it starts.
That's how it starts.
That's how it starts.

When I discovered the wonder of
The path was easier to see
There ain't no other
But the one I love.
Won't you come deliver me?

Give a little bit of your love to me.
Give a little bit of your love to me.
Give a little bit of your love to me.
Give a little bit of your love to me.---Lyrics submitted by Andres Vega.
