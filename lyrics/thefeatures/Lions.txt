Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh 

Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh 

You might find yourself
Angry at the things I do
Things I put you through
Hope your able to forgive me
Like I forgive you, I forgive you

Chorus:
OH girl what are you thinking?
I'm thinking that we (ooo oo ooo)
Should stick together
I reckon that we (ooo oo ooo)
Should follow our hearts
All right now, let's stick together
Let's follow our hearts
Not even lions can tear us apart

Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh 

Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh 


I'm looking for answers
some kinda relief
Some kinda salvation
to make it all complete

Chorus

Let's stick together
Let's follow our hearts
Not even lions can tear us apart

Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh 

Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh oh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh
Oh oh oh oh aoh aoh 

Ohh girl, what are you thinkin?---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
