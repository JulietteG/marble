Got a horseshoe in my pocket
And my hands are full of gold
My hearts racing like a rocket,
Wind it up and watch it go

Well be ruling in the sunlight
Like were pharaohs on the throne
Well be dancing in the moonlight,
Dancing all the way back home

Theyre coming home at last
Theyre coming home again
Theyre coming home at last
Theyre coming home again
Theyre coming home at last
Theyre coming home again
Theyre coming home again

Skies open, where we going
Its in the stars, its who we are
Dont you worry about the morning
Its in the stars, its who we are
Were blowing up, blowing up the door

Blowing up, blowing up
Were blowing up, blowing up the door
Skies open, where we going
Its in the stars, its who we are

Got a horseshoe in my pocket
And my hands are full of gold
My hearts racing like a rocket,
Wind it up and watch it go

Well be ruling in the sunlight
Like were pharaohs on the throne
Well be dancing in the moonlight,
Dancing all the way back home

Theyre coming home at last
Theyre coming home again
Theyre coming home at last
Theyre coming home again
Theyre coming home at last
Theyre coming home again
Theyre coming home again

Skies open, where we going
Its in the stars, its who we are
Dont you worry about the morning
Its in the stars, its who we are

Were blowing up, blowing up the door
Blowing up, blowing up
Were blowing up, blowing up the door

Skies open, where we going
Its in the stars, its who we are

Skies open, where we going
Its in the stars, its who we are
Dont you worry about the morning
Its in the stars, its who we are

Were blowing up, blowing up the door
Blowing up, blowing up
Were blowing up, blowing up the door

Skies open, where we going
Its in the stars, its who we are---
