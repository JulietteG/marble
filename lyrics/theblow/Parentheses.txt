some philosophies fuel a belief in the self,
         constructed to keep one's goods on one's own shelf. 
                             built well you're a strong letter I,
                                     with the feet on the ground and the head to the sky.
now and then you can bend,
        it's okay to lean over, lean over my way. 
              you fear that you can't do it all,
              and you're right.
even diligent day takes relief every day
         from its work making light from the night.

                  (chorus) x2
and when you're holding me
       we make a pair of parentheses. 
             there's plenty space to encase
                         whatever weird way my mind goes, 
i know Ill be safe in these arms.

if something in the deli aisle makes you cry
   you know Ill put my arm around you
   and Ill walk you outside, 
          through the sliding doors, 
why would I mind?

you're not a baby if you feel the world. 
           all of the babies can feel the world. that's why they cry.

                   (chorus)---
