Your face is clogging up my dream 
smiling so goddamn tenderly
but I know that your heart is artificially sweet
and still I can't pull you out of me
like a bad bone that a good son can't forget (?)
guess its been too long since you ravaged through my head
well this is unfair there's a girl who loves me
get out of my head and let me love free
hell I know that your no good for me
there ain't no grown man that should be living in a memory
gotta set myself free
slow down my thoughts and let my heart free
Your face is clogging up my dream
smiling so goddamn tenderly
but hell I know this ain't no good for me
there ain't no grown man that should be living in a memory
memories of making love stronger than drugs
memories of all the sweet things we said
help me forget her eclipse my heart with yours
help me remember the life worth loving for
hell I know that this ain't no good for me
there ain't no grown man that should be living in a memory
but hell I know this ain't no good for me 
there ain't no grown man that should be living in a memory, living in a memory
in love with a memory, memory set me free, in love with a memory---Lyrics submitted by emily bell.
