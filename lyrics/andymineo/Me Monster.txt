Going from the bottom to the top
Everybody wanna be somebody
Giving everything, they give it a shot
To get a little bit of face time
Going from the bottom to the top
Everybody wanna be somebody
But what if I told you, you, somebody knows you?

Yeah, they say racks, on racks, on racks, on racks, huh?
I bet they never told you about that tax on tax, huh?
Tyshane got tracks on tracks
So I put a rap to it, back to it
With a passion to use it for the movement
And its tatted on back, if you unashamed where you at?

His kingdoms are ready, but not yet
We ready, we on deck
Come and get us, Maranatha
They ask me how Im doin I say better than I deserve
Cus I got the medicine, I was in sick
Now Im walking upright, like swerve

Going from the bottom to the top
Everybody wanna be somebody
Giving everything, they give it a shot
To get a little bit of face time
Going from the bottom to the top
Everybody wanna be somebody
But what if I told you, you, somebody knows you?
