You know there's one single to root right? Hebrews 12:15 check it out
You know there's a few things in my life that cause me to be bitter and, I'm just asking God, I'm like

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away

Anybody know the feeling of rejection?
Feels like you was kicked in your midsection,
When you feel like you simply just lost your best friend,
Everybody play the game of love you [?],
You start thinking she's chillin with other men, and you gettin jealous, start beefing, and harboring harsh resentment,
I'm asking Jesus to keep me from being bitter, go skeeming on twitter, get mad and post it on my statuses,
Bitterness can make a heart numb,
But hope is like a star you don't see it shine bright until the dark come,
So don't just scoop the dust, remove the rug,
If I got unforgiveness in my heart, then there really ain't no room for love,
Plus it's stupid cause, I've been so forgiven,
That if I hold a grudge, I don't show He's risen,
But I know my sins removed since Jesus came,
With no reason to forgive me but He did so I do the same

Ugh

Sometimes things just happen in life that don't make any sense, but, bitterness is a choice

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away

Yea, I gotta tread softly,
Don't wanna be a hypocrite plus I got some bitterness I wanna get up off me,
Where should I start, well I feel like I'd be sorta frontin',
To say that when my father calls that I don't hit ignore button,
It's probably cause we never kicked it at a younger age,
I know when he's calling but I don't have got his number saved,
I keep dodging him but I'm just being honest,
All he wanna do is talk football and how I should play in college,
I get bitter, kinda cold like the winter,
It's so hard for me to forgive him then I remember that I'm a sinner,
And Jesus forgave me and washed away my sins,
When I didn't deserve it then I could forgive him,
His power in such amazing love like when Jesus forgave the ones that pinned him up on that cross as he was hanging from it,
Holy Spirit, teach me to be just like the Son,
Remove the roots of bitterness don't stop until your work is done

God I don't wanna be bitter, teach me to forgive, let me see my own sin

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away

Bitter, bitter, bitter

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away

Bitter, bitter, bitter

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away ---
