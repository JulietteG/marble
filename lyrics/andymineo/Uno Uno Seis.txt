[Chorus]
Uno Uno Seis
Una Uno Uno Seis
Una Uno Uno Seis
Please dont get up in my way
[4x]

My vatos in Cali
Dominicanos up in N.Y.
Cubanos in Miami
Colombianos we worldwide
I rep that Wash Heights like all day, its unashamed like cosmay
I try to walk that narrow path, but your boy live off of broadway
I took the A-train to 1-6-8, Dominicanos playin dominoes
And them platanos all on my plate, New York in my mind state
But you know we take it international, we finna to follow anywhere the master goes
So we hang with and bang with every language even though we speakin that Spanglish like
Dimelo loco, chacho let's go, vamonos we out here oh
Mi amigos y yo venimos from the West Side to the East Coast so
Aint nobody rappin like this what
Unashamed the name of my clique yup[?]
Todos los dias, hermanito, dale ya tu sabe ahh

[Chorus]
Uno Uno Seis
Una Uno Uno Seis
Una Uno Uno Seis
Please dont get up in my way
[4x]

This is for my vatos in Cali
Dominicanos up in N.Y.
Cubanos in Miami
Colombianos we worldwide
Im on my uno (uno) uno (uno) seis you know my crew bro
Unashamed since 02 bro, before the 1-1-6 tattoos bro
Now you dont really know if you got time like that
To hear the truth and fellas never mind like that
Or we unashamed of but then again spit it how we live it so we get it on a grind like that
From Tejas and thats Texas, A-T-Ls where I'm resting
Said I might catch a plane to rep for my King, Puerto Ricos on my checklist
Boricuas, Cubanos, perdonen mi espaol
Aqui con mis hermanos, to give Jesus to these VATOS
I pop up no Peter, all about the blood the body fresh eaters
Used to be the Walking Dead but that season ended, now partner I'm a believer, rra!

[Chorus]
Uno Uno Seis
Una Uno Uno Seis
Una Uno Uno Seis
Please dont get up in my way
[4x]

Uno uno seis boy you know we dont play boy
Spit a lot of truth they call it the good news put it all up in your face boy
Catch us on arroz con frijoles with some tostones
We ain't worried bout folks thinkin we phony,
Jesus know me deja
Know where Im going and know what I'm doing
And only Yeshua got a raggity due
You part of the movement that you gotta pursue
Holla 1-1-6 if you rep the truth!
Holla 1-1-6 if you rep the truth!
Set booms a blazing, the face can take a trip to force the wedges opposite we chose
Thank you because you gave us news thatll break them chains, that will make us new!
Mira mi caballo, I dont gotta pay nada, he took them hits like piatas, halleluyah the father
Encuerpo y mis palabras, le voy a dar a la masa
1-1-6 be my partners, in god we trust not them dollars hah

[Chorus]
Uno Uno Seis
Una Uno Uno Seis
Una Uno Uno Seis
Please dont get up in my way
