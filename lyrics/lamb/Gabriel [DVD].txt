I can fly
But I want his wings
I can shine even in the darkness
But I crave the light he brings
Revel in the songs that he sings
My angel Gabriel

I can love
But I need his heart
I am strong even on my own
But from him I never want to part
He`s been there since the very start
My angel Gabriel x2

Bless the day he came to me
Angel`s wings carried him to me
Heavenly

I can fly
But I want his wings
I can shine even in the darkness
But I crave the light that he brings
Revel in the songs that he sings
My angel Gabriel x3

My angel Gabriel x3
My angel x3
Gabriel x4---Lyrics submitted by Stian.
