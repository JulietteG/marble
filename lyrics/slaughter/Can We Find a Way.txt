Whatever happened to our innocence
I'm gonna find a quiet place inside
All I want to do is break down the wall between us
And put an end to this foolish pride

Don't ya hear by message of love
Don't ya know it comes from above
Can we find a way to shine an inner light
Can we find a way to make it work out right

We should meditate a higher conscious
Listen in peace, in peace and harmony
All I want to do, all I want to do
Is brighten your darkest days

So do you hear my message of love
Don't ya know it comes from above

Can we find a way to shine an inner light
Can we find a way to make it work out right
Can we find a way to let it shine, let it shine
Can we find a way to intensify your mind

I'll take your pain away and give you all of me
I'll let you in my world unconditionally
I see you in my dreams smiling in my mind
Whispering my name, let it shine, let it shine
