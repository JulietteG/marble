It's so good to see you now
It's been so long since we've been together
You kept in touch somehow
You always found a way to be there
[Chorus:]
I wish that I could stop the hands of time between us
All the days gone by
Do you remember when we were the best of friends
All the days gone by
You know that memories never fade
As you're watchin' all your days go by
Lookin' back on younger years
That's what our hopes and dreams are made of
All the laughter and the tears
It's the feeling of love that makes us
[Chorus:]
All of the feelings that we had before
But through the years, oh those were the times
Ooh yeah, alright
The memories we share
You can't erase them from your mind
Those were days gone by
You know that memories never fade
As you're watchin' all your days go by
They go by, they go by, they go by, they go by
You know that memories never fade
As you're watchin' all your days go by---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
