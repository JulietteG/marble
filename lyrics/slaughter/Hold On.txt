Now that the party's over
My head spins round and round
I'm gonna get my feet back on the ground
I know that you are out there somewhere
Thinkin' 'bout what we've done
'Cause I'm wonderin' where your heart is
This feelin' can't be wrong
[Chorus:]
Hold on, baby hold on
I can't go on baby without you
Hold on, baby hold on
After all that we've been through
I can't go on baby without you
Hold on, baby hold on
You said that we were special
Like no other kind
I can't believe what we both left behind
I wish that we could be together
I just can't let go
'Cause I love you more than ever
More than you'll even know
[Chorus:]
Tossing, turning, dreaming of you
Every day of my life
[Chorus:]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
