I've got this hopeless feelin' so deep down inside 
They telephones this mornin', said you weren't alive 
You said you'd never leave me, but now that's not true 
Oh darlin darlin darlin darlin darlin...if you only knew 
I drown in emotion can't you see 
You have taken every part of me 
I'll hold you close on this last goodbye 
But I know...I'll Break Down N' Cry 
I'll Break Down N' Cry...Break Down N' Cry 
I never ever wanted for it to end this way 
I wish there was somethin' that I could say 
You go your way, I guess I'll go mine 
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby 
I'll love you till the end of time 
I drown in emotion can't you see 
You have taken every part of me 
I'll hold you close on this last goodbye 
But I know...I'll Break Down N' Cry... 
Break Down N' Cry...Break Down N' Cry... 
Cry...Cry... 
I drown in emotion can't you see 
You have taken every part of me 
I'll hold you close on this last goodbye 
But I know...I'll Break Down N' Cry 
I'll Break Down N' Cry...Break Down N' Cry 
Oh I don't wanna Break Down N' Cry...---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
