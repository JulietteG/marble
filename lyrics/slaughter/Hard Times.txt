As seen through my eyes, it's tougher all over 
You can read it in the news of the world 
Been shot down in flames by a face with no name 
The image of truth is unheard of 
It's hard to take it 
So will you make it 
You start to wonder 

[Chorus:]
And now you're goin' through 
Hard Times 
You're goin' through Hard 
Times no one can deny 
You're goin' through 
Hard Times 
Look around you it's
Hard Times 

So now you learn from the concrete and pavement 
It's hard to see through city lies 
Ironic it seems all the sweet talk and dreams 
Have turned to the things you despise. 
It's hard to take it 
So will you make it 
You start to wonder 

[Repeat Chorus]

It's hard to take it 
So will you make it 
You start to wonder 

[Repeat Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
