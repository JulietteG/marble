Yeah!

Well, come on everybody
Are you feelin' good?
Cause I know about you, lady again

So pick your poison and attitude
Come on and let the party begin
Party time

Oh yeah

Yeah
So dangerous, livin' so dangerous
Dangerous, all night long
Dangerous, yeah so dangerous
Dangerous, come on!
Yeah 

When I'm livin' easy and ridin' free
Ain't nobody ever gonna slow me down
Rock n' roll, it's a one way street
That's where me and the boys can be found
Raise 'em up
Ooh, raise 'em up

Yeah
So dangerous, livin' so dangerous
Dangerous, all night long
Dangerous, yeah so dangerous
Dangerous, come on!
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
