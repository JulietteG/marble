Ain't never gonna settle down 
Cuz I've got something to say 
I'm not gonna get pushed around 
and nothin's gonna stand in my way 
Well I'm all pumped up and I m ready to go 
I'm gonna stand up and shout 
And if ya don't like what I'm saying to you 
Don't let the door hit ya on the way out! 
[Chorus:]
Get use to it 
Ya gotta live out of control 
Get use to it 
Cuz rock n' roll is in your soul! 
Now listen up 
Nothins ever gonna slow me down 
I always got my foot on the gas 
And if ya can't groove to these sounds 
Well pucker up and kiss my ass! 
I'm like a 44 magnum on a 
shooting range that's what I'm all about 
And if you don't like what I'm saying to you 
Don't let the door hit ya on the way out! 
[Repeat Chorus]
Cuz what you think of me is none 
of my damn business 
I'm just gonna drive along with 
the windows down and the wind 
in my hair and my middle finger 
in the air! 
Because rock n' roll is here to 
stay and if you don't like it, my 
finger's gonna be pointed your way! 
Get use to it 
Ya gotta live out of control 
Get use to it 
It's Rock n' roll. 
[Repeat Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
