I see a silhouette by the window
There's a nightgown on the floor
I feel desire in your eyes
I taste the honey of your soul
[CHORUS]
Do you feel dizzy without a drink of wine
Is this forever, or does this happen every time
In the heat of the moment
When two bodies are melting as one
Embers fallin' down from the fire above
And you'll be cryin' out for more
In the heat of the moment
I slip her hair through my fingertips
And I kiss her head to toe
Waves are crashin' in my heart
But you will never know
[CHORUS]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
