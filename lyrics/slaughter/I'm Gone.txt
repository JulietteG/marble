Take it to the limit it's so good to be alive
Send out an all points bulletin and join the rocket ride
Because I'm gone...I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I've got the pedal to the medal
And I hope to see you soon
I've got so much testosterone I'm blowin' up the room
Because I'm gone...I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[CHORUS]
Can't you see no pain no gain
Runnin' around inside my brain
Everybody come along
Because I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[CHORUS]---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
