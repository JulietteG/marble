Let the good times roll, oh yeah
You're gettin' out of your day job, feelin' so good
'Cause you're on your way to a rock n' roll show, dressed to kill
But don't just stand there with your hands on your hips
Sayin' my, my, my

Come on and dance for me baby
Won't ya show me a little action?
Why don't ya dance for me baby?
Won't ya show me a little action?

'Cause if there's one thing that I want
It's just another thing that you might need
Why don't ya dance for me baby?
Won't ya show me a little action?

So ya end up out in the parking lot after the show
And you're lookin' for your friends
You wonder which which way did they go, man
But don't just stand there with a smile on your face
Sayin' why, why, why?

Come on and dance for me baby
Won't ya show me a little action?
Why don't ya dance for me baby?
Won't ya show me a little action?

'Cause if there's one thing that I want
It's just another thing that you might need
Why don't ya dance for me baby?
Won't ya show me a little action?

So now you're backstage and ya want your picture in a magazine
And then the band comes out of the room
Sayin' what do ya mean
So if ya read right between the lines
Yes, this really happens all the time, yes indeed

Come on and dance for me baby
Won't ya show me a little action?
Why don't ya dance for me baby?
Won't ya show me a little action?

'Cause if there's one thing that I want
It's just another thing that you might need
Why don't ya dance for me baby?
Won't ya show me a little action?

Dance for me baby---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
