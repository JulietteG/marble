As I pack my bags and follow all my dreams
I really hate to see you cry
You know it hurts me too
This is how it's got to be
The time has come for me to fly

You know you keep me hangin' on
It's our love that makes me strong
You're the world to me for eternity

So I'm looking back on yesterday
And how we laughed until we cried
And we feel it as we're all growing older
It's so hard to say good-bye
Once again it's hard to say good-bye

As I stare into the hourglass of life
I think of how I left you then
When my life is over and all is said and done
You can hear me sing this song again

You know you keep me hangin' on
It's our love that makes me strong
You're the world to me for eternity

So I'm looking back on yesterday
And how we laughed until we cried
And we feel it as we're all growing older
It's so hard to say good-bye
Once again it's hard to say good-bye---Lyrics submitted by Benny.
