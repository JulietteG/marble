My hearts starts breaking
When I think of making up plans to let you go.
I keep thinking, maybe tomorrow
Im gonna let you know...

But when I think about leaving,
I think about losing
the only love I ever knew
Everytime I think of you.

My heart starts breaking,
my hands keep shaking
and you know, you know, you know,
it would take a strong, strong man,
to ever let you go.

My hearts been hurting
When I see you flirting
Everynight out on the floor,
I keep thinking, maybe tomorrow
Youll grow to love me more.
But whenever were together
I could leave you never
Even though you treat me cruel.
Everytime a look at you.

My heart starts breaking
my hands keep shaking
and you know, you know, you know
it would take a strong, strong man,
to ever let you go.

Ive tried to resist you,
When youre gone,
all I ever do is miss you,
anyone in love would know...
Anyone with half a heart could
never let you go...

Guitar

But when I think about leaving
I think about losing
The only girl I ever loved...
Cant you tell me why do you hurt me?.
I guess some people never see
specially a fool like me.

(My heart starts aching, my hands keep shaking,
and you know, you know, you know)
It would take a strong, strong man
to ever let you go
(To ever let you go)
To ever let you go.
(To ever let you go).
Ill never let you go... ---Lyrics submitted by jaime diaz.
