I live in my apartment above a costume shop 
At night I creep down, 
And try on everything they've got 
'Cause I don't know who I am 
I don't know who I am 
Gotta find out who I am 
I don't know who I am 

Sometimes I'm a space man 
Sometimes I'm Captain Hook 
Sometimes I'm a rodeo rider 
Or Chairman Mao with my little red book 
'Cause I don't know who I am 

I sit on my roof top. 
Looking for a shooting star 
Baby dreams come true some times, 
'Cause there you are 
But you don't know who I am 
You don't know who I am 
Gotta find out who I am 
You don't know who I am 

Sometimes I'm a space man 
Sometimes I'm Captain Hook 
Sometimes I'm a rodeo rider 
Or Chairman Mao with my little red book 
You could be my Wonder Woman 
I could be your Superman 

I don't know who I am 
Anymore...
Anymore..

Sometimes I'm Spider Man 
Trying to catch you in my web 
Sometimes I'm rolling for cover 
Under my bed 
I had the moment 
Well I don't know where it went 
Baby I'm just Clark Kent 

Sometimes I'm a space man 
Sometimes I'm Captain Hook 
Sometimes I'm a rodeo rider 
or Chairman Mao with my little red book 
You could be my Wonder woman 
I could be your Superman 

I could be your Superman 
I could be your Superman 
I could be your Superman---
