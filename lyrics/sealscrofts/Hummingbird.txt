Oh hummingbird, mankind was waiting for you to come flying along.
Heavenly songbird, we were so wrong. We've harmed you.
Oh hummingbird, lend us your wings. Let us soar in the atmosphere of Abha.
Lift us up to the heaven of holiness, oh source of our being, oh hummingbird.

Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away. Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away.
In you I've found a fragrance. I'll love you 'til I die.
I just love you, love you, love you. I don't even know the reason why.
Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away. Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away.
The sweetness of your nectar has drawn me like a fly.
I just love you, love you, love you. I don't even know the reason why. Now,
Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away. Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away.

Haven't you noticed the days somehow keep getting longer?
And the spirit voices whisper in us all.
Haven't you noticed the rays? The spirit sun in stronger
And a new day is dawning for us all.

Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away. Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away.
Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away. Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away.
The draught of understanding; wisdom, peace and love is ours.
Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away. Hummingbird don't fly away, fly away.---Lyrics submitted by mars.
