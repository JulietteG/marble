She caught the katy 
And left me a mule to ride 
She caught the katy 
And left me a mule to ride 

Well, my baby, caught the katy 
She left me a mule to ride 
The train pulled out 
And I swung on behind 
I'm crazy 'bout her 
That hard headed woman of mine 

Man, my baby long 
Great god, she mighty, she tall 
You know my baby long 
Great god, she mighty, my baby tall 

Yeah, my baby she long 
My baby she tall 
She sleepin' with her head in the kitchen 
And her big feet's out in the hall 
An' I'm still crazy 'bout her 
That hard headed woman of mine 

Well, I love my baby 
She's so fine 
I wish she'd come 
And see me some time 

If she don't believe I love her ? 
Look, what a hole I'm in 
If she don't believe I'm sinking 
Look what a shape I'm in 

She caught the katy 
And left me a mule to ride 
She caught the katy 
And left me a mule to ride 

Well, my baby caught the katy 
Left me a mule to ride 
The train pulled out 
And I swung on behind 

I'm crazy 'bout that 
The hard headed woman 
Hard headed woman of mine 
Huh-huh, huh-huh---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
