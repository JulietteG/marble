The devil went down to Georgia
he was looking for a soul to steal 
He was in a bind cuz he was way behind
He was willing to make a deal
He came across a young man
sawing on a fiddle playing it HOT

The devil jumped up on a hickory stump
and said "boy lemme tell you what"
"I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too"
"and if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you"
"Now you play pretty good fiddle boy but give the devil his due"
"I bet a fiddle of GOLD against your SOUL to think I'm better then you"

The boy said" MY names Johnny and it might be a sin"
"but I'll take your bet your gonna regret I'm the best theirs ever been"

Johnny rosin up you bow and play that fiddle hard
Cuz hells broke loose in Georgia 
and the devil deals the cards
and if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your SOUL

The devil opened up his case
and said I'll start this show
fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
and then he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

When the devil stopped playing Johnny said
"Well your pretty good ol son"
"but sit down in that chair right their and lemme show ya how its done"

fire on the mountain  run boys run
the devils in the house of the risin sun
chicken in the bread pan picken out dough
granny does your dog bite  no  child,no

The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
then he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said "Come on back devil if you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch I'm the best theres ever been"---Lyrics submitted by sara.
