007; Britain's finest secret agent, licensed to kill.
Mixing business with girls and thrills.
I've seen you walk the screen, it's you that I adore.
Since I was a boy I've wanted to be like Roger Moore.
A girl in every port, and gadgets up my sleeve.
The world is not enough for the both of us it seems.
So I wish I was James Bond, just for the day.
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away.
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day.
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away.
Hello Mr Bond, I've been expecting you.
Martini in your hand, and that eyebrow that you move.
Don't take this the wrong way, I know it might sound odd.
I'm the next double 0, I'm the right man for the job.
So I wish I was James Bond, just for the day.
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away.
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day.
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away.
I've a license, I've a license, I've a license to thrill.
I've a license, I've a license, I've a license to kill.
I've a license, I've a license, I've a license to thrill.
I've a license, I've a license, I've a license to kill.
I wanted to be you, I wanted to be you, I wanted to be someone else.
I wanted to be you, I wanted to be you, I wanted to be someone else.
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day.
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away.
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day.
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away.
And I wish I was James Bond, just for the day.
Kissing all the girls, blow the bad guys away.
Roger and Sean and Timmy and George and Daniel and Pierce and maybe one day me---Lyrics submitted by Willson.
