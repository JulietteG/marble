Why don't you come home,
 its not very far.
I wait up each night,
 for the sound of your car.
Well, well well, 
we both knew it wouldn't be easy.
Oh how we both knew it wouldn't be easy.
Oh yeah yeah,
 but oh I never thought it ever be, ever be this hard.
It's been three weeks,
 since I got a decent sleep.
I've a restless head and an empty bed,
 these dreams are killing me so,

[Chorus:]
I keep on walking til the sun comes up.
I keep on walking til the sun comes up.
I keep on walking til the sun comes up.
I keep on walking til the sun comes up.

I'm bored and alone, 
it's been far too long.
Why don't you come home, 
it's where you belong.

Well well well,
 we all could do with the money, yeah.
Well we all could do with the money.
But oh whats the use of the money,
 when we aint got no time

it's been 3 weeks
since i got a decent sleep.
i've a restless head and an empty bed,
these dreams are killing me so,

[Chorus a lot of times]---Lyrics submitted by Bella.
