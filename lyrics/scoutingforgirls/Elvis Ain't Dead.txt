when i was young i never knew,
what this thing called love could do to you.
but since you've been gone
and ive been on my own,
i've been feeling quite peculiar.

but i'll get by without your smile,
and i'll get through without you.

but i wish it was me you chose,
i wish it was me you chose,
i wish it was me you chose,
i wish it was me you chose,
cause Elvis ain't dead,
and you're coming back.
Elvis ain't dead,
and you're coming back.

OH!

since you've been gone i can do what i like
but it doesn't mean alot to me
i'm all shook up
and i'm lonesome to night
i think i need a love lobotomy

but i'll get by without your smile
and i'll get through without you.

but i wish it was me you chose
i wish it was me you chose
i wish it was me you chose
i wish it was me you chose
cause Elvis ain't dead
and you're coming back
and Elvis ain't dead
and you're coming back

Oh no, Oh no, Oh no, come home

You, Me maybe we were never meant to be
You, Me maybe we were never meant to be

Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
cause i heard him on the radio
Elvis isn't dead 
Elvis isn't dead
and you're coming back to me i know
Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
cause i heard him on the radio
Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead

me you chose
i wish it was me you chose 
i wish it was me you chose
i wish it was me you chose
cause Elvis ain't dead
and you're coming back
Elvis ain't dead
and you're coming back

and Elvis ain't dead
(Elvis ain't dead)
Elvis ain't dead
(Elvis ain't dead)

and Elvis ain't dead
(Elvis ain't dead)
Elvis ain't dead
(Elvis ain't dead)

(Elvis had left the building thankyou and goodnight!)---Lyrics submitted by julie.
