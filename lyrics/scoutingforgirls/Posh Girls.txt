She passed, shes class
Candy for the eye and a twinkle in her smile
She looks like butter wouldnt melt, oh oh oh
Hes bewitched, her daddys rich
You can see she comes from money but shes still a little honey
And it looks like butter wouldnt melt, oh no

He stuttered oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I never thought Id say this
But I think youre so aw-aw-aw-aw-awfully nice
Its alright, she said fine

He was a little bit scared, a little apprehensive
He was just a boy from a local comprehensive
But hed heard that
Posh girls have good manners but they go like the clappers because they never got to hang around with boys at school
Posh girls have good manners but they go like the clappers because they never got to hang around with boys at school

She seems pristine
But dont be deceived cause shes not that nave 
It looks like butter wouldnt melt
He had a fright, that night
She opened his eyes to a world of surprise
And the butter, oh the butter, it had gone, it had gone

She goes oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
With a twinkle in her eye, she said oh my 
To me oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh tonight, tonight

He was a little bit scared, a little apprehensive
He was just a boy from a local comprehensive
But hed heard that
Posh girls have good manners but they go like the clappers because they never got to hang around with boys at school
Posh girls have good manners but they go like the clappers because they never got to hang around with boys at school

Theres nothing like a little bit of class
Wrapped up in a perfect ass
Theres nothing like a little bit of class
The poor boy never stood a chance

Is it true what they say about posh girls? (Is it true, is it true what they say?)
Is it true what they say about posh girls? (Is it true, is it true what they say?)
Is it true what they say? (Is it true, is it true what they say?)
Is it true what they say about posh girls? 

Posh girls have good manners but they go like the clappers because they never got to hang around with boys at school
Posh girls have good manners but they go like the clappers because they never got to hang around with boys at school

Theres nothing like a little bit of class
Wrapped up in a perfect ass
Theres nothing like a little bit of class
The poor boy never stood a chance
Theres nothing like a little bit of class
They all said its never gonna last
Theres nothing like a little bit of class
Wrapped up in a perfect ass
