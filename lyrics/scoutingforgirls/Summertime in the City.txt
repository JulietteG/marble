Summertime in the city, all the girls dress hot
Make the boys go silly
There they go, walking round the streets downtown on a wonder

Effect is on the shades, love in the summer

Ha, ha, ha the temperatures rising
Never got a break, dont blame him for trying
Everybodys out, its good for the soul
The sun on your skin
And all the kids glow

Oh, oh, oh
Here comes the summer
Oh, oh, oh
Here comes the summer

Summertime in the city
And were getting in the mood
And were getting there quickly
Tips
Girls watch the boys
Boys watch the girls
And no one wants to be by themselves in the water
They show us some shades
Im going to the park
For you in the sun and the smell of the grass
New summer clothes, way off the load, and nobody here really wants to go home

Oh, oh, oh
Here comes the summer
Oh, oh, oh
Here comes the summer

Its summertime in the city, girls dress hot
Boys go silly
Im out and i wonder, checking all the sides, love in the summer

Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city
Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city
Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city

Im going out in the evening, loving this feeling
New friends, old friends, feeling
Its gonna be a night to remember
Ill never meet a girl like you in November
The girl next door shes a high street honey
She dress quite short and she thinks Im funny
L.A., New York, Sidney, Rome
When the skys in the sun,
Theres no place like home

Its summertime in the city, girls dress hot
Boys go silly
Im out and I wonder
Checking all the sides, loving the summer

Oh, oh, oh I hope that it doesnt rain
Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city
I hope that it doesnt rain
Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city
I hope that it doesnt rain
Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city

Its summertime in the city, girls dress hot
Boys go silly
Im out and I wonder
Checking all the sides, loving the summer

Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city
Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city
Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city
Hey there, miss sunshine
Its summer, its summer, its summer in the city
Hey there, miss sunshine---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
