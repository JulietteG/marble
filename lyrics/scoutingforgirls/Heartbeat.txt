am i alone in your heart?
have i a hope with your heart?
she's such a teaser
she's such a star
give me a reason or give me a chance

am i alone in your heart?
am i alone?
it tears me apart.

doing all i can do just to be close to you,
everytime that we meet i skip a heartbeat.
always up for laugh she's pain in the ass,
everytime that we meet i skip a heartbeat.

give me an evening or give me a night,
i'll show the time of your life.
i walk u home safe from the dark,
i'll give you my jacket
i'll give you my heart.

but she wont come dancing tonight,
she's having the time of her life.

doing all i can do just to be close to you,
everytime that we meet i skip a heartbeat.
always up for a laugh she's a pain in the ass,
everytime that we meet i skip a heartbeat.

i do love, she does heartbreak,
i did love till she broke my heart.
i do love, she does heartbreak,
i did love till she broke my heart.

i do love, she does heart break,
i did love till she broke my heart.
i do love, she does heartbreak,
i did love till she broke my heart.

doing all i can do just to be close to you,
everytime that we meet i skip a heartbeat.
always up for a laugh shes a pain in the ass,
everytime that we meet i skip a heartbeat.

i skip a heartbeat for you...

doing all i can do just to be close to you,
everytime that we meet i skip a heartbeat.
always up for a laugh shes a pain in the ass,
everytime that we meet i skip a heartbeat.

i skip a heartbeat for you.---Lyrics submitted by julie.
