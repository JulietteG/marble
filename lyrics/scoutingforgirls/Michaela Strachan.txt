I turned on the telly 
When i got home from school
You were there in your wellies
And a yellow cougoul

You opened my eyes
To the birds and the bees
I loved you so
My really one show
The BBC

Michaela Strachan
You broke my heart
Michaela Strachan 
You tore me apart
Michaela Strachan 
You broke my heart
When i was twelve

It aint gonna happen
For you and the Strachan
It aint gonna happen
For you and the Strachan

I used to want to be a vet
Just so i see you one day
You put the meaning in
Like a day

I found my self working
In a shop at sixteen
It never stopped hurting
To miss you on TV

I'll always remember 
All those times that we had
You helped me to sleep
I fancied you heaps
And so did my dad

Michaela Strachan
You broke my heart
Michaela Strachan
You tore me apart
Michaela Strachan
You broke my heart 
when i was twelve

It aint gonna happen
For you and the Strachan
It aint gonna happen
For you and the Strachan

I used to want to be a vet
Just so i'd see you one day
you put the meaning in
Yeah you put the meaning in!
Yeah you put the meaning in, like a day!!

You put the meaning in, like a day.---Lyrics submitted by Bethany.
