Mirror, mirror on the wall
How could I be such a fool?
Mirror, mirror I cant see myself no more

Breathe, breathe in
Welcome to a town called original sin
Breathe, breathe out
Easy getting in, it aint easy getting out
Cry, out loud
If youre in for a penny, youre in for a pound
Dont, dont pause
Youre just another sad case, another lost cause

Mirror, mirror on the wall
How could I be such a fool?
Mirror, mirror I cant see myself no more

A little mistake
Thats how you caught me
Riding around with little miss naughty
A little mistake
Am I seeing double?
I see in your eyes youre gonna be trouble, youre gonna be trouble, youre gonna be trouble

Breathe, breathe in
If only you could see all the trouble Im in
Breathe, breathe out
Another house of cards comes tumbling down

Mirror, mirror on the wall
How could I be such a fool?
Mirror, mirror I cant see myself no more

A little mistake
Thats how you caught me
Riding around with little miss naughty
A little mistake
Am I seeing double?
I see in your eyes youre gonna be trouble, youre gonna be trouble

Mirror, mirror on the wall (youre gonna be trouble)
How could I be such a fool? (youre gonna be trouble)
Mirror, mirror I cant see myself no more (youre gonna be trouble)

A little mistake
Thats how you caught me
Riding around with little miss naughty
A little mistake
Am I seeing double?
I see in your eyes youre gonna be trouble, youre gonna be trouble, youre gonna be trouble
