Take a chance, before its gone
Throw me a rope or string me along
Im nothing without you, this man is nothing without you
I know its been a difficult year
Its been all I can do just to keep you near
I want you to know youre the star of my show

I sing these songs about you
It wouldnt be the same without you
I know you try to hide, I know you try to act tough

But take a chance on us (take a chance on us)
Throw your arm round love (dont give me up)
Let it pull you up tonight, take a chance on us tonight
But take a chance on us, (take a chance on us)
But I wont give us up (dont give me up)
Take a chance on us tonight, take a chance on us tonight

I always thought that we could make it through
If you gave me the chance, I always knew
I dont care what they say, you were mine all the way
And thought it seems like its pouring again
You dont get flowers without no rain
Look what weve done, look how far we have come

Well I sing these songs about you
It wouldnt be the same without you
I know you try to hide, I know you try to act tough

But take a chance on us (take a chance on us)
Throw your arm round love (dont give me up)
Let it pull you up tonight, take a chance on us tonight
Take a chance on us, (take a chance on us)
I wont give us up (dont give me up)
Take a chance on us tonight, take a chance on us tonight

Take a chance on us 
Throw your arm round love 
Let it pull you up tonight
I know that times are tough (I know that times are tough)
I know we aint got much (I know we aint got much)
But I cant give us up tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

But take a chance on us (take a chance on us)
Throw your arm around love (dont give me up)
Let it pull you up tonight, take a chance on us tonight
But take a chance on us, (take a chance on us)
I know we aint got much
I wont give us up tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
