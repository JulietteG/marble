Staying in again on a Saturday night
Im gonna settle on the sofa and turn down the lights
Ive got 900 channels, but theres nothing to see
No wonder everybody thinks they should be on TV

We all wanna be famous
Be our face on the screen
Read our name in the papers
Everybody wants to be on TV
Na na na na na na na na na na
Everybody wants to be on TV

Forget Audrey Hepburn
Forget Bettie Davis
I want to be known just for being famous
I cant act, I cant dance, I cant sing, cant you see?
But Im young and Im pretty and thats all that you need

We all wanna be famous
Be our face on the screen
Read our name in the papers
Everybody wants to be on TV
Na na na na na na na na na na
Everybody wants to be like James Dean

I want to be the star tonight
And complain about fame in a story I sold to the news
I wanna be the star tonight
Wanna make the front pages I posed to the boys in the nude

We all wanna be famous
Be our face on the screen
Read our name in the papers
Everybody wants to be like James Dean

We all want, we want to be famous
We all want to be like James Dean
We all want, we want to be famous
We all want to be on TV
(x2)

We all want, we want to be famous
We all want to be like James Dean
