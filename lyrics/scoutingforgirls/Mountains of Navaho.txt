I don't know what went wrong, I woke up one day and you had gone.
Forever, there's no such thing as forever.
You left a mess, not a note.
You emptied my wallet, and you stole my smokes.
But I'm easy, forgiving you is easy.
I just wanna be with you,
I'll never be a guy like he-man.
I'll never be a girl like Shera.
I'm a lonely beast like battle cat
Coz that one day we will fly, over seas high in the sky.
Coz one day we will go, high in the mountains of navaho.
High in the mountains of love.
You took my car but you left your cat.
Who I never really liked and I've since sent back to your mother.
There's no-one quite like your mother.
I'll never stop till I track you down.
If I takes 10 years I'll have you found.
Coz I'm only trying not to be lonely.
I just wanna be with you.
I'll never be a guy like he-man.
I'll never be a girl like Shera.
I'm a fragile beast like battle cat
Coz that one day we will fly, over the seas over the sky.
Coz that one day we will go, high in the mountains of navaho.
High in the mountains of love.
Coz that one day we will fly, over the seas and over the sky.
Coz that one day we will go, over the hills of navaho.
Coz that one day we will fly, over the seas and over the sky.
High in the mountains of love---Lyrics submitted by Bella.
