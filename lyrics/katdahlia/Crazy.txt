Is it crazy that I want you to stay 
When I tell you to leave 
When I tell you go 
Is it crazy that I say your name 
More times a day 
Than I say my own 
Tell me baby is it crazy? 
Tell me baby is it crazy? 

Is it crazy when youre gone for a minute 
Im missing you, Yeah I feel alone 
Is it crazy that Im jealous of them bitches 
When they get your time 
And I know its wrong 
But tell me is it crazy? 
Yeah, I need to know if its crazy 
Damn 

Cuz I ain't been myself 
Lately somethings going on 
Nah boy I ain't even slept 
I been up all night long 
In my head 
Trying to figure out what I want what I do 
What I dont 

Is it crazy all them answers is You 
Tell me cuz its blowing my mind 
Tell me cuz I dont understand 
How someone just can walk into your life 
And everything before them you forget 

Is it crazy? 
Tell me whats going on 
I need to know 
Cuz I ain't tryna lose myself 
Or lose control 
Baby tell me the truth 
I need to know 
Is it crazy? 
Baby is it crazy? 

Is it crazy that I told my ex dont call no more cuz Im in love? 
Is it crazy that I keep your shirt right here just to smell your cologne? 
Damn that sounds crazy 
Tell me is it crazy 

Cus I ain't been myself 
Lately somethings going on 
Nah boy I ain't even slept 
I been up all night long 
In my head 
Trying to figure out what I want what I do 
What I dont 

Is it crazy all them answers is You 
Tell me cuz its blowing my mind 
Tell me cus I dont understand 
How someone just can walk into your life 
And everything before them you forget

How someone just can walk into your life 
And everything before them you forget
