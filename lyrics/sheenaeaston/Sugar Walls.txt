My sugar walls
My sugar walls

Where I came from there's a place called heaven
That's the place where all the good children go
The houses are of silver, the streets are gold
But there's more where you come from, my sugar walls

(My sugar walls) oooh (my sugar walls)

Blood races to your private spots, lets me know there's a fire
You can't fight passion when passion is hot
Temperatures rise inside my sugar walls

Chorus:

Lemme take you somewhere you've never been
I can show you things you've never seen
I can make you never wanna fall in love again
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls

Take advantage, it's alright

I feel so alive when I'm with you
Come and feel my presence, it's reigning tonight
Heaven on earth inside my sugar walls

(Chorus)

I can tell you want me, (my sugar walls) it's impossible to hide
Your body's on fire, admit it! Come inside (my sugar walls)
Ahhhhhhhhh (my sugar walls) oooooh
Come inside (my sugar walls) , my sugar walls (my sugar walls)
Come spend the night inside my sugar walls (my sugar walls)---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
