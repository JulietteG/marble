Something else weas in this place
Something I will never meet again
Something we will always think of
I saw the glance in your eyes
Before it disappeared
And I saw the didillusion in your eyes
Your terrible confusion
I killed a star in Krasnodar
I didint see the death between my lips
So sorry for the things I said -
and did not say.

I am - Im not afraid
I am - Im not afraid
I am - Im not afraid
I am - Im not afraid of you.

So I was blind for what I saw
So I was deaf for what i heard
I lost my star in Krasnodar
So I am cold for what I felt
So I am dead for Im alive
I lost my star in Krasnodar
In krasnodar.

Shine - shine - shine - my star
Shine - shine- wherever you are
Shine my star
Wherever you are.

You are not here in this place
For I know we will not meet again
Therefor I will always think of you
Why cant you just see:
I am no alien - dont you know?
I am as black as white
Always the one whos fighting for
Someone to hold
I killed your smile I killed you belief
I killed the star of Krasnodar
I didnt see the death between my lips
O sorry for the things i did -
And did not do.

So I was blind for what I saw
So I was deaf for what i heard
I lost my star in Krasnodar
So I am cold for what I felt
So I am dead for Im alive
I lost my star in Krasnodar
In krasnodar.

Shine - shine - shine - my star
Shine - shine - wherever you are
Shine - shine - shine - my star
Shine - shine - wherever you are.---Lyrics submitted by Leonardo.
