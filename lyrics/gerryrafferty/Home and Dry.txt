This silver bird takes me 'cross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
'Cross the ocean, way above the clouds
I'll come stealin'

Feelin' tired, but I feel good
'Cause I did everything I said I would
I think of you, and I know how you'll be feeling

I gotta see you,I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now, in every way
It's gotta be you, it's gotta be you
Yes, from now on I'll tell you everyday

Way up here above this timeless sea
I realize just what it is, you mean to me
You give me something when I thought that everything we had was dying
I needed reason just to make me carry on
Well, I know better now, I know where I belong
I can't imagine how I ever let myself just give up trying

I gotta see you,I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now, in every way
It's gotta be you, it's gotta be you
Yes, from now on I'll tell you everyday
Woo ooh ooh hoo, ooh ooh ohh yes I'm home and dry


Ain't nothin' up here gonna slow me down
You know I never ever take the long way 'round
I think of you, 'cause I know how you'll be feeling
This silver bird takes me 'cross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
'Cross the ocean way above the clouds, I'll come stealin'

I gotta see you, I gotta be with you (I'm on my way, tonight)
We'll make it better now, in every way
It's gotta be you, it's gotta be you 
Yes, from now on I'll tell you everyday
Woo ooh ooh hoo, ooh ooh ooh yes I'm home and dry
