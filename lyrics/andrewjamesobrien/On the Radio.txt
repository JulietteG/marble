If I sing for you 
Play these strings for you 
Would you let me in 
Would you let me through 

If I cut my hair for you
Change what I wear for you
Could my record play
Could it fill your ears for you

Cause you wont hear this song on the radio
It wont make you dance cause its too slow
But Ill give my heart at the next show, the next show
Still better, better, better than your radio

If I paid the toll for you
Sold my soul for you
Could I pay my rent
Could I see this winter

If I cried for you
Lay down and died for you
Would you let these words run round inside of you
It wont make you dance cause its too slow
But Ill give my heart at the next show, the next show
Still better, better, better than your radio

Im not going you see 
Cause Ive got friends like me 
And you wont hear their song on the radio
They wont make you dance cause theyre too slow 
But theyll give their hearts at the next show, the next show
Still better, better, better than your radio x6---Lyrics submitted by Lauren Yahner.
