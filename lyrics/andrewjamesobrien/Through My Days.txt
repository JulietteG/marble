Walls start to crumble
It'll happen someday
You wake up one morning
And ask me to stay

The sun breaks your windows
And shatters your eyes
You realise

Wallow through winter
Plead day into night
Lived in my shadow
Hid from the light

Two eyes pierce my armor
Sought their way through
Sin without speaking
We already knew
That you are the bird
And your song
Is running through my days
Through my days

Your fragile glass heart
Carries a weight
Of something gone missing
You've not yet replaced

But keep searching sweetheart
What I'm trying to say
Is all that I'm feeling
With words in the way
But you are the bird
And your song
Is running through my days
Through my days---Lyrics submitted by Sam Colaris.
