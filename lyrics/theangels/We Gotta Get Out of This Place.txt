In this dirty old part of the city
where the sun refused to shine
people tell me there is no use in trying
now my girl you so young and so pretty
and one thing I know is true
you'll be dead before your time is due
see my daddy in bed a dyin'
see his hair it's turning grey
he's been working and slaving his life away

He's been working so hard
every night and day
ooh I've been working too
yeah, yeah

We gotta get out of this place
if it's the last thing we ever do
we gotta get out of this place
girl there's a better life for me and you

Now my girl you so young and pretty
and one thing I know is true
you'll be dead before your time is due
see my daddy in bed a dyin'
watch his hair it's turning grey
he's been working and slaving his life away

He's been working so hard
every night and day
yeah, yeah, yeah

We gotta get out of this place
if it's the last thing we ever do
we gotta get out of this place
girl there's a better life for me and you---
