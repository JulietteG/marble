She comes in here every night 
That I ain't over it yet look in her eyes 
Its just her and that glass 
Whoever he was, he must have hurt her bad 
Some fools never learn yeah that her song 
She orders a double when it comes on 

She's got the neon blues 
She ain't in the mood 
For any more lies or pickup lines 
She ain't lookin' for love, 
She knows it ain't nothing but a drink or two 
And he'll be off her mind 
Tonight she's just trying to lose those neon blues 
Neon blues 

Go on and give it a shot, 
Man I think its gonna take more than you've got. 
She'll let you buy a round, 
That's as far you'll get then she'll shoot you down 

She's got the neon blues 
She ain't in the mood 
For any more lies or pickup lines. 
She ain't lookin' for love, 
She knows it ain't nothing but a drink or two 
And he'll be off her mind. 
Tonight shes just trying to lose those neon blues. 

Any kind of tequila, 
Now that what she likes, 
I'm trying to tell you, 
You're wasting your time. 

She's got the neon blues. 
She ain't in the mood 
For any more lies or pickup lines. 
She ain't lookin' for love, 
She knows it ain't nothing but a drink or two 
And he'll be off her mind. 
Oh tonight shes just trying to lose those... 
Oh tonight shes just trying to lose those... 
Neon Blues 
Neon Blues 
Neon Blues 
Neon Blues---
