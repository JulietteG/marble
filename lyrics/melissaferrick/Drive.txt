If you want this
If you want this
If you want this youre gonna have to ask nicely
Yeah if you want this youre gonna have to ask
Youre gonna have to ask me
What ever you want Ill give it to ya 
Ill give it to ya slowly 'til youre just beggin me to hold you
Yeah what ever you want
What ever you want but youre gonna have to ask me

Cuz your mouth waters stretched out on my bed
Your fingers are trembling and your heart is heavy and red
And your head is bent back your back is arched
My hand is under there holding you up

Ill hold you up and drive you all night
Ill hold you up and drive you baby til you feel the daylight
Ill hold you up and drive you all night
Ill hold you up and drive you til you feel the daylight thats right
Thats right 

In the kitchen in the shower in the back seat of my car Ill hold you up
In your office preferably during business hours 
Cuz you know how I like it when theres people around
And I know how you like it
I know how you like it
I know how you like it when I tease you for hours

Your mouth waters stretched out on my bed
Your fingers are trembling and your heart is heavy and red
Your head is bent back and your back is arched
My hand is under there holding you up

Ill hold you up and drive you all night
Ill hold you up and drive you baby til you feel the daylight
Ill hold you up and drive you all night
Ill hold you up and drive you til you feel the daylight oh and this has just begun
And this has just begun cuz we havent even gotten started yet
I havent even 
I havent even tied you up I havent even turned you over
This is where I wanna live
Right here right between your hips 
Where all the love you hold hide its where it is
Right here right between your hips this is where I wanna live
Its where all the love you give exists

Your mouth waters stretched out on my bed
Your fingers are trembling and your heart is heavy and red
Your head is bent back your back is arched
My hand is under there holding you up

Ill hold you up and drive you all night
Ill hold you up and drive you baby til you feel the daylight
Ill hold you up and drive you all night
Ill hold you up and drive you baby til you feel the daylight thats right
Yea thats right thats right thats right Ill hold you up
Thats right Ill love you all night yea thats right thats right---Lyrics submitted by Brenda.
