ooooooohohoh

You know I am your man
Come on, I'm not your friend
Now don't you be afraid
Come closer, I don't mind

I don't need a microphone to tell me what I'm really feeling for you
That deep down feeling you know, I let things out so i can put 'em back in
All it is I'm really trying to say is that I'll always be here for you
I am your man my friend, and Im just the right man for you

... let your head down
I'll poor you, a cup of tea
Well share our love for music
While I lick you clean (lick you clean)

I don't need a microphone to tell you what i'm really feeling for you
I am your man my friend, and Im just the right man

I don't need a microphone to tell you what I'm really feeling for you
That deep down feeling you know, I let things out so i can put 'em back in
All it is I'm really trying to say is that I'm always gonna be here for you
I am your man my friend, and Im just the right man for you

hey ... I'm the right man for you
hey, hey ... I'm the right man for you
hey ... I'm the right man for you
hey ... I'm the right man for you
hey, hey ... I'm the right man for you---Lyrics submitted by Sander Bruggeman.
