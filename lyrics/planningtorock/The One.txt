We dance to grow	
We grow to give
We stop to move
We move to live

Someone's meaning a lot to me

We turn, we take
We slip, we slide 
We hurt, we break
We pain, and we cry

but someone's meaning a lot to me

And I don't want to fight it
I want to love it
and dont wanna hate it
I want to love it

Someone's meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me

I know the void, the void knows me.
It keeps us weak, the void told me	
but you are meaning a lot to me.

And I don't want to fight it
I want to love it
and I dont wanna hate it
I want to love it

Someone's meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me

You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me
You are meaning a lot to me---Lyrics submitted by Mark R.
