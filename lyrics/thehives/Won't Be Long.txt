No bright lights, no big city went to my head
So I won't stick around in this town
No I'm getting out instead

'Cause I can't find a thing here to get it done 
to race my heart and ring my ears
So I won't stick around in this town 
And that's true ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 

'Cause I won't and I can't and I don't understand
You became what you hate or you hate what you become

Got me a ticket and I won't be long 'cause I can't go on and I gotta get goin'
Got me a ticket and I won't be long 'cause I can't go on and I gotta get goin' away

So I make my way through the quagmire
Of boomers glorifying their youth
And all the peacocks in this city
So if I may be excused

'Cause I won't and I can't and I don't understand
You became what you hate or you hate what you become

Got me a ticket and I won't be long 'cause I can't go on and I gotta get goin' [x3]
Got me a ticket and I won't be long 'cause I can't go on and I gotta get goin' away

Well I won't be around for the good times
Won't be around for the bad 
And I won't stick around in this town
No I'm getting out instead

I won't
And I can't
And I'll leave
'Cause I can
And I won't be back again!

Well I

Got me a ticket and I won't be long 'cause I can't go on and I gotta get goin' [x3]
Got me a ticket and I won't be long 'cause I can't go on and I gotta get goin' away

And I gotta get gone away
Cuz I gotta get gone away
Gotta get gone away---
