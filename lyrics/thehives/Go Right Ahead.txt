Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go, go, go,
Go right ahead
Down the streets in a uniform
Find a bull and you grab the horns
Go right ahead
Scream your head off, like the day you was born

Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go, go, go,
Go right ahead

Heres a secret keep it tight
Its California late at night
Go right ahead
Were gonna drink, fuck and fight all night
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go

Is it right, or wrong, you never know it
Soldiers come along
I wanna show it
Our god is a Zilla, our king is a Kong
The rooms about to crumble as I burst into song
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
You gotta go from A-Z from when you're born until you're dead

Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go, go, go
Go right ahead

Like a tiger breaking out of the zoo
Go right ahead
Do anything that you wanna do
The rumours you heard, they were all true
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go

Is it right, or wrong, you never know it
Soldiers come along
I wanna show it
Our God is a Zilla, our King is a Kong
The rooms about to crumble as I burst into song

Go right a
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead

Down the streets in a ufo
Find a bull and you grab the horns
Go right ahead
Scream your head off, like the day you were born

Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead
Go right ahead---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
