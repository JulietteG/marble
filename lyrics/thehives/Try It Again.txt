Here is to you honey
But I'm out of your league
Never gonna pass me
'Cause I'm out of your league, your league, your league

Lookie here baby
You're coming my way
But I move like a landslide
So get out of my way and stay away

Up from the floor on the count of ten
Oh you get up, you get down and you try it again

Up and down and around again
Oh you get up you get down and you try it again
Up and down and around again
Oh you get up you get down and you try it again
Oh you get up you get down and you try it again
All right! Oh Oh Oh

Time to learn a lesson
Like Pavlov's dog
If same-ing isn't working
Why don't you different instead, instead, instead

Like Samson and Delilah
Attila and the Huns
You're ready for a new round
Don't it look like it's gonna be fun, be fun

Up from the floor on the count of ten
Oh you get up you get down and you try it again

Up and down and around again
Oh you get up you get down and you try it again
Up and down and around again
Oh you get up you get down and you try it again
Oh you get up you get down and you try it again

They say the defenition of madness is doing the 
same thing and expecting a different result...

That's right!

Doo wacko! Up and down
Doo wacko! Down and up
Doo wacko! Round for round
Doo wacko! Hit the ground
Doo wacko! Up and down
Doo wacko! Ah you get up you get down and you try it again
Down and up 
Doo wacko! Ah you get up you get down and you try it again
Round for round
Doo wacko! Ah you get up you get down and you try it again
Hit the ground
Doo wacko! 
Ah you get up you get down and you try it again [x4]---
