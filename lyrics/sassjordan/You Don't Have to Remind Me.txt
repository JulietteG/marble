Wind blows thru this empty room 
Like blood from an open wound 
Shut my eyes - I don't wanna see 
Outside there's a big parade 
Some girl - She got it made 
Things change in the time it takes to breathe 
But I can't stand to see her hands on you 
Cause you were my religion too 

You don't have to remind me 
I don't need you to bring it home 
You don't have to remind me 
Cause every night - I sleep alone 

My friends all say I got nothin' to lose 
So what if I can pick and choose 
Those substitutes - They're just a waste of my time 
So here I sit in this lonely room 
Just me and a lover's moon 
Funny how love can be so unkind 
Sometimes I wish I could forget the past 
Cause I can't stand to see it last 

You don't have to remind me 
I don't need you to bring it home 
You don't have to remind me 
Cause every night - I sleep alone 

I know there's people who can walk upon the water 
So how come I'm sinking like a storm? 
You part the sea - Then you walk away from me 
I don't know how much longer I can breathe 

You don't have to remind me 
I don't need you to bring it home 
You don't have to remind me 
Cause every night - I sleep alone---Lyrics submitted by Liane.
