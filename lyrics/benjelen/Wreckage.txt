A whisper to my ear, I'll make the words out through the waves
Since you've not been here, I've changed my tune
And all I can hear is  your sound, and I'd say you're coming 'round

I can feel the sunlight barely breaking on the sea
I don't want to miss you, I don't want you missing me
It's about time we climb out of the wreakage
I can see a way now, you can come and rescue me
I don't want to waste this, I don't want it wasting me
It's about time we climb out of the wreakage,
Sky is ours to write, we can finally send the message

This won't disappear, 'cause we can't let go of what we love
Cannot interfere, I'm not afraid
I know that the darkness come on the closer we get to dawn

I can feel the sunlight barely breaking through the trees
I don't want to miss you, I don't want you missing me
It's about time we climb out of the wreakage
I can see a way now, you can come and rescue me
I don't want to waste this, I don't want it wasting me
It's about time we climb out of the wreakage
Sky is ours to write, we can finally send the message

Long before the damage is done
Long before we've got to listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

I can feel the sunlight barely breaking into me
I don't want to miss you, I don't want you missing me
It's about time we climb out of the wreakage
I can see a way now, you can come and rescue me
I don't want to waste this, I don't want it wasting me 
It's about time we climb out of the wreakage
Sky is ours to write, we can finally send the message

We can finally send the message
It's about time, It's about time
We can finally send the message---Lyrics submitted by angela.
