Let's Roll the windows down turn the radio up
Let the wind blow through our hair
Love is reckless, lets get reckless tonight

There ain't nothing out here but a big, tall Texas sky
There's a red sun painted across the pond tonight
Well your daddy's got plans for you
And mine thinks I'm at school
They say it's reckless to chase a dream
But this town's got nothing for you and me

Let's roll the windows down turn the radio up
Let the wind blow through our hair
There's a moon tonight and a road outside
Baby we're gettin' out of here
I could care less where it leads us
Love is reckless, let's get reckless tonight

Let's take my Thunderbird and leave tonight
I'll keep the pedal to the floor until we see morning light
They can't live our lives for us
If we let 'em we'll lose our love
And love dies hard in this Texas sun
I'd rather be reckless and on the run

Let's roll the windows down turn the radio up
Let the wind blow through our hair
There's a moon tonight and a road outside
Baby we're gettin' out of here
I could care less where it leads us
Love is reckless, let's get reckless tonight

When you're crazy in love you gotta take a chance
Burn the bridge and don't look back

Turn the radio up roll the windows down
Let the wind blow through our hair
There's a moon tonight and a road outside
Baby we're gettin' out of here

Roll the windows down, turn the radio up
Love is reckless, let's get reckless
Let's get reckless...---
