Clear creeks and cool mountain mornings
Honest work out in the fields
Cornbread in my momma's kitchen
Daddy saying grace before the meal

Family ties run deep in this land
And I'm never very far from what I am

I was born country and that's what I'll always be
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free
I got a hundred years of down home, running through my blood
I was born country and this country's what I love

Moonlight and you hear beside me
Crickets serenadin' in the yard
What more could two people ask for
Laying here in love beneath the stars

Now this is where I wanna raise my kids
Just the way my mom and daddy did

I was born country and that's what I'll always be
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free
I got a hundred years of down home, running through my blood
I was born country and this country's what I love

I was born country and that's what I'll always be
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free
I got a hundred years of down home, running through my blood
I was born country and this country's what I love

I was born country---
