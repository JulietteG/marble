If you're gonna play in Texas, You gotta have a fiddle in the band. That lead guitar is hot, But not for "Louisianan man". So rosin up that bow for "faded love" And let's all dance. If you're gonna play in Texas, You gotta have a fiddle in the band. I remember down in Houston We were puttin' on a show When a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled, "Cotton-Eyed Joe"! He said, "we love what you're doin'. Boys don't get us wrong, There's just somethin' missin' in your song. Chorus So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight. Them Texans raised the roof when Jeff opened up his case. You say why'all all want to two-step. you say ya want to doe-si-doe. Well, here's a fiddlin' song before we go. Chorus Repeat and fade---Lyrics submitted by Michael.
