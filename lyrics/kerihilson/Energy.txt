I wish I could rip out a page of ma memory
'Cuz I put to much energy in him and me 
Can't wait till i get through this phase 'cuz itz killin'me 
To bad we can't re-write our own history

Such a mystery when he's here with me
Itz hard to believe im still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
Thiz aint how itz supposed to be

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me 
This love is taking all of ma energy
Energy,ma energy taking all of ma energy
Energy,ma energy taking all of

Seems only like yesterday,not even gravity
Could keep your feet off the ground when your here with me
How could two be as one we've come so divided now
There's no use hiding from ma misery,no

Such a mystery when he's here with me 
Itz hard to believe im still lonely
Chances fading now,patience running out
Thiz aint how itz supposed to be

Im having noghtmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry 
I don't want us to be the end of me 
Thiz love is taking all of ma energy,energy,
Ma energy taking all of ma energy energy 
Ma energy taking all of

Now I can feel you changing me
And i can't afford to slip much further
From the person I was meant to be , whoa
Im not afraid to walk alone
Not giving up,im moving on before it gets to deep
Cause you takin all of ma energy

Im having nightmares from sleepin with the enemy
How do reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me 
Thiz love is takin all of ma energy

Im having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse  the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of ma energy, energy
Ma energy,taking all of ma energy,energy,ma energy
Taking all of ma energy

Your killing me,your taking all of me ,yeah oh
This love is taking all of ma energy---Lyrics submitted by Achelle.
