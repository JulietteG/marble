Every woman, yeah
Every woman
Gotta limit yeah
Sang with me girl

Ladies, have you ever had a man who push you when you low
You wanna stay out at night, and dont care how you feel
Instead of manin up, oh I said ooooooooooooo
I-I cant concentrate, you so petty you
You stay touchin my last nerve, my friends say whats wrong with you girl
I guess, what Im really tryna to say is

Every woman has a breaking point yall (breaking point)
Hey, I know you know, some women can be lied to
And cheated on, and beated on
Somebody know, heeeeeeyyyyy
Every woman has a breaking point yall (breaking point)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, tell me why we put up with that
You cant forget that, see I done did that
But this time, theres a limit to my love
(Theres a limit, theres a limittheres a limit, theres a limit)
Theres a limit to my love
(Theres a limit, theres a limittheres a limit, theres a limit)
Now listen here

Now baby, dont push me cuz Im close to the edge
Today your baby momma called, said she boxin up yo sh!t (yo sh!t)
When you barely pleasin me, how you gon take care of yo kids
Now I gotta contemplate, I hate to say it but I wanted your last name
My momma said whats wrong with you girl

Every woman has a breaking point yall (breaking point)
(And Im almost there I swear)
Hey, I know you know, some women can be lied to
And cheated on, and beated on
Somebody know, heeeeeeyyyyy
Every woman has a breaking point yall (breaking point)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, some women let you keep em in check
Constantly disrespect, then show no regret
(Around here honey) theres a limit to my love
(Theres a limit, theres a limittheres a limit, theres a limit)

Theres a limit to my love

Now ladies, we really should be mad at ourselves
Cuz see, some women just tolerate way too damn much
Now I know we gotta choose our battles
But damn it, every woman gotta breaking point
And see the next time hes testin yo love
You put your finger in his face and you tell him

Say my love has a limit (say my love has a limit)
Say my love has a limit (say my love has a limit)
Said if your love has a limit, girl (said if your love has a limit)
Say my love has a limit, yeah (say my love has a limit)

Say my love has a limit (my love has a limit)
Say my love has a limit (my love has a limit)
Said if your love has a limit, girl
Say my love has a limit now

Every woman has a breaking point yall (breaking point)
Hey, I know you know, some women can be lied to
And cheated on, and beated on
Somebody know, heeeeeeyyyyy
Every woman has a breaking point yall (breaking point)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, if you feel me put your hands up
If he aint man enough, girl if you had enough
Tell him, theres a limit to my love
(Theres a limit, theres a limittheres a limit, theres a limit)
Theres a limit to my love
(Theres a limit, theres a limittheres a limit, theres a limit)---Lyrics submitted by christella.
