[yea]
& i feel so alienated , alienated
[yea]

Verse:
[oohhhhhhhh ohh oh yea yea yeaaaaaa]
[where did you go]
since i've become a shooting star
i've been wondering where you are
seem like your forever in a deerway
momma told me, it would happen to me one day
feels like we've been apart for some light years
creater in my heart
filled with my tears
stars in line
i'll be yo girl again
[what i'm trynna say]
want you back in my world again


hook:
Your the reason i dont change my number
what you to know its still the same
and i bet you remember that summer
when we kicked it everyday
dont know how it happen
just happened
kinda like we
faded away
and i feel so alienated
(dont you feel so) alienated

Chorus:
i miss you and i want you back
i lost yo signal, where you at
and i dont know how we lost contact
where did you go
im searching for you,
cant get you outta my system
outta my system
outta my system
cant get you outta my system
outta my system
outta my system
cant get you outta my system
outta my system
outta my system
where did you go
im searching for youuu

Verse:
sittin, watching time passing by me
voices in my head asking why me
im here wish you would stop by my place
but the only time we talk is on myspace
by the way
have found my replacement
she should be the one on this spaceship
freakin out,
reaching for you when your not there
you got me in another galaxy
i'm out there

hook:
Your the reason i dont change my number
want you to know its still the same
oohhh boy, i know you remember that summer
when we kicked it everyday
dont know how it happen
just happened
kinda like we faded away
and i feel so alienated
[dont you feel so] alienated

Chorus:
i miss you and i want you back
i lost you signal where you at
and i dont know how we lost contact
where did you go
im searching for you,
cant get you outta my system
outta my system
outta my system
cant get you outta my sysytem
outta my system
outta my system
cant get you outta my system
outta my system
outta my system
