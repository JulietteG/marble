Sun down, Friday night,
Uptown city lights,
Here I go start it out,
I like,
Dressed up out the door
So damn ready for one night maybe more,
I like, I like,
With strobe light hot corse dirty minds
When you cross my way,
I like, I like,
Just you and I touch at first sight,
And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
I like, I like,
I'm losing control right now and I feel its right,
I like, I like,
Were caught in this moment I wont let you go,
And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
I like, I like, I like, I like,
Hey there pure star lets go way to far come a little closer
I like,
Heart flips up and down,
Dancing on sleezy ground,
Betcha want to get it on,
I like, I like,

You've got me down right electrified,
Don't stop the rides,
I like I like,
Just you and I,
Here and now what a night
I, I, I, and the world around us wont stop turning to night,
I like, I like,
I'm losing control right now and I feel its right,
I like, I like,
Were caught in this moment I wont let you go,
And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
I like, I like, I like, I like,
Dance all night don't stop the music,
I like I cant refuse it,
Dance all night don't stop the music,
I like I cant refuse it
And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
I like, I like,
I'm losing control right now and I feel its right,
I like, I like,
Were caught in this moment
I wont let you go
And the world around us wont stop turning to night,
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like ---
