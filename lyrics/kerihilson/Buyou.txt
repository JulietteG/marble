One for the paper, two for the money 
Girls get money? ... 
You see this what I like about? 
Buy you music, cause you better buy you a car, you better buy you a phone 
You better buy somewhere to stay or I'ma walk right by you 
I don't know what's going on, baby? What the hell is going on, baby? 
Used to take me to dinner, used to take me shopping 
Now you're asking me for my paper 
It's my money, ... my money, I bet you'll never ever get a dime for me 
No you can't use the phone, baby 
I think you need, get your own 

There's something going man holding down 
So how did I end up with you? You 
And that's how ... has a car, time ... hard, paying all these bills 
... my car, so I don't need no broke boy trying to hide ... 

One for the paper, two for the money 
Brand new bag, no shoes yet I want it 

All my girls flag girls getting money X 2 

One for the paper, two for the money 
Girls ... give all you want it 

One for the paper, two for the money 
All my girls flag girls getting money 

You wanna ride with that chick baby? 
But you ain't got a whip baby 
Yeah, it ain't gotta happen ... don't got shit you need to break with that chick baby 
Yeah, money, don't look my way if you ain''t got that money 
And I'm making ... baby 
Take the time it's your treat 

There's something going man holding down 
So how did I end up with you? You 
And that's how ... has a car, time ... hard, paying all these bills 
... my car, so I don't need no broke boy trying to hide 

One for the paper, two for the money 
Brand new bag, no shoes yet I want it 
One for the paper, two for the money 
All my girls flag girls getting money 
All my girls flag girls getting money 
One for the paper, two for the money 
Brand new bag, no shoes yet I want it 
One for the paper, two for the money 
All my girls flag girls getting money 

...broke ass niggers 
Him only check you for the ... 
No, no, no, I'm not a gold digger 
... 
You know the .. niggers 
no middle man, ...your own coke nigger 
...And I don't need a man with no accomplishments 
No wit, no job, no ...forget it 
If he was my sugar, I'd be diabetic 
But the old book got already readed 
It's money on my mind boy and you just have it 
... 
Money old like champagne in the cellar 
Boy you need to spit like a ... 
You ain't treating me like an atm teller 
So fuck your little cheese, I got my old cedar 
So when they make it raid I hope I got my umbrella.---Lyrics submitted by Daizy.
