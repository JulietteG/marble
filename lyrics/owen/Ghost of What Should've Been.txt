What else in this room, reminds me of you?
The window seal, where the crucified pit, of an avacado still sits in water.

What else in this room, reminds me of the relationship I've ruined?
The table I made, strong enough to hold your magazines, but not your tired legs.

One more week in this apartment, one more week of being haunted
by the ghost of what should have been, but won't be.

What else in this fucking empty room, reminds me of fucking you?---
