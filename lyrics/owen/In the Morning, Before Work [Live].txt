I eat with these crooked teeth, tomato soup and grilled cheese
but you already know that cause you used to dine with me,

I listen to my same old cd's, new order and more ....
but you already know that, cause you used to drive around with me

I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now,
but this song about you keeps coming out.

I sleep in these dirty sheets, a blanket between my boney knees.
But you already know that cause you used to crawl in bed with me
in the morning before work
Put you hands on my back, kiss the back of my neck.

I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now,
but this song about you keeps coming out,
I'd hoped to be singing to someone new by now
but this song's about you...---
