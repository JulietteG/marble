My dove
You came to the window as a spark
And left as a raven after dark
Was I the tourist in your heart?
Now love
I tried to be a native in your land
But you dismissed me careless hand

Chorus
For Ive held paradise
But lost sight of it now

And time
Dont be a stranger with a drop
Fill in the spaces
Set up shop
I need a fix
Fast forward clocks

Chorus
For Ive held paradise
But lost sight of it now
Yes Ive held paradise
But lost sight of it now

All I want is to hold you to me now
All I want is forever to allow

Chorus
For Ive held paradise
But lost sight of it now
Yes Ive held paradise
But lost sight of it now.---Lyrics submitted by Tonya.
