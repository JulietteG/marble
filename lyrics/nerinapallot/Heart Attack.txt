In a little while
People and place's will
Be so far behind
Out of my body

In a little while
I will play aces
And raise my glass
In a note of defiance

But untill then
I scream untill I'm hollow
I carve it in my skin
Save it for tomorrow

I'm gonna bang my drums
I'm gonna make it come, yeah
I'm gonna bring it on, now
It's a heart attack
A heart attack,
I'm bringing it,
Bring it back, 
I'm bringing it back
To me
To me

In a little while
It will be prefect
I'll have the perfect style
Soon you will see

Not a clowd in sight
No cumulus, nimbus
Just ninty-three percent
Degrees humidity

Until then,
I scream until I'm hallow
I carve it in my skin
Save it for tomorrow

I'm gonna bang my drum
I'm gonna make it come, yeah
I'm gonna bring it on, oh
It's a heart attack
A heart attack
I'm bringing it,
Bringing it back, 
I'm bringing it back

I'm gonna bring it on in,
Just a little while,
Make the good things come

I'm gonna bang my drum
I'm gonna make it come, yeah
I'm gonna bring it on oh,
It's a heart attack
A heart attack
I'm bringing it,
Bringing it back,
I'm bringing it back,
To me

Out of my body
I'm
Out of my body

Out of my body
I'm
Out of my body---Lyrics submitted by Shannan.
