In a race to get out of this place
I am checking my face in the back of a spoon
You're accusing - you say I'm not here
But I'm here, yes I'm here, I'm not on the moon
I'm leaving so soon

Don't presume to know shit about me
'Cause I don't know myself 
From one day to the next
And I don't pose perplexities purposly
'Cause it isn't a game - it isn't a test

And now hey, you
Could you give it a rest?
Just take me home, come on
And get me undressed
Put on the fire
And make it enough -
Oh, we're geeks
But we know this is love

Nine am to the beat of a drum
As we drive through the canyon
I'm feeling the hum of the engine
My head and my heart are aswim
Will your cat be ok? Your wife is she in?
Your wife is she in?

'Cause I don't presume to know shit about you
And you won't really tell me 'till I beg you to
But I know that perplexity's a wonderful thing
It's a sudden found joy, the strangeness it brings

And now hey, you
Can you give it a rest?
Just take me home, come on
And get me undressed
Put on the fire
And make it enough,
Oh, we're geeks 
But we know this is love
This is love, yeah, 
Geeks, but we know this is love

I like that we argue,
But not every day
You're sent in a room 
And the way that you say,
Color not colour
What colour today?
It's gray...gray..it's gray

Oh, hey you
Could you give it a rest?
Just take me home, come on
And get me undressed
Put on the fire
And make it enough
Oh, we're geeks
But we know this is love
This is love

Hey you,
Could you give it a rest?
Just take me home, come on
And get me undressed
Put on the fire
And make it enough
Oh we're geeks
But we know this is love
This is love, yeah
Geeks but we know this is love---Lyrics submitted by Shannan.
