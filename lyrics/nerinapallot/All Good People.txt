Hey was there something that you wanted to say?
I don't know what to do when you look that way,
Cigarettes and tequila at 6,
And the sung oing down on our life as it is,
In the blue light oh, your face, it looks...so...pale,
In the blue light, I can tell what you're going to say.

But all good people have a sense of themselves,
They never worry, they know what tomorrow will bring,
And all good people the world is ok,
Why should we worry, when we can do anything?

I heard that story, how you never went back,
What your mouth will not say, your eyes do for you...
A paper flower, and her pill in your drawer,
And her ghost at the bar drinks tequila too,
In the blue light, could we put this one to bed?
In the blue light, will you think of me instead?

'Cause all good people have a sense of themselves,
They never worry, they know what tomorrow will bring,
And all good people know the world is ok,
Why should we worry, when we can do anything?

In the blue light, could we put this one to bed?
In the blue light, will you think of me instead?

'Cause all good people have a sense of themselves,
They never worry, they know what tomorrow will bring,
And all good people know the world is ok,
Why should we worry, when we can do anything?
All good people, all good people know good people.---Lyrics submitted by viana.
