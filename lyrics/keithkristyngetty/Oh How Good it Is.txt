Oh how good it is
When the family of God
Dwells together in spirit
In Faith and unity
Where the bonds of peace,
Of acceptance and love
Are the fruit of His presence
Here among us

So with one voice we'll  sing to the Lord
And with one heart we'll live out His word
Till the whole earth sees
The Redeemer has come
For He dwells in the presence of His people

Oh how good it is
On this journey we share
To rejoice with the happy
And weep with those who mourn
For the weak find strength
The afflicted find grace
When we offer the blessing
Of belonging

So with one voice we'll  sing to the Lord
And with one heart we'll live out His word
Till the whole earth sees
The Redeemer has come
For He dwells in the presence of His people

Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da

Oh how good it is
To embrace His command
To prefer one another
Forgive as He forgives
When we live as one
We all share in the love
Of the Son with the Father
And the Spirit

So with one voice we'll  sing to the Lord
And with one heart we'll live out His word
Till the whole earth sees
The Redeemer has come
For He dwells in the presence of His people---Lyrics submitted by Mark Rodriguez.
