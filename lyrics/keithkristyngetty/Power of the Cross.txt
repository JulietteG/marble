Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to calvary
tried by sinful men, torn and beaten then
nailed to a cross of wood

This the pow'r of the cross
Christ became sin for us
took the blame, bore the wrath 
we stand forgiven at the cross

Oh, to see the pain written on your face
bearing the awesome weight of sin
every bitter thought, every evil deed
crowning your bloodstained brow

This the pow'r of the cross
Christ became sin for us
took the blame, bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross

Now the daylight flees
Now the ground beneath
quakes as it maker bows his head
curtain torn into
dead are raise to life
"finished" the victory cry

This the pow'r of the cross
Christ became sin for us
took the blame, bore the wrath
we stand forgiven at the cross

Oh, to see my name written in the wounds
for through your suffering I am free
death is crushed to death
life is mine to live
won through your selfless love

This the pow'r of the cross
son of God slain for us
what a love, what a cost
we stand forgiven at the cross---Lyrics submitted by susan mills.
