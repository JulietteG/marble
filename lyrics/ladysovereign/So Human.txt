Me, you, yeah yeah, everyone,
we've had what in days,
miss away cannot relate.
I'm a star, I'm an individual, 
an educated example of intelligence,
I'm considered to be cool.
Hot bodies, offended people,
the mood of sage bitten on innocent people
Anyways, things change, 
always at the hotel, always, 
I'll be gone again in 4 days.

I've been waiting hours for this, 
I've made myself so sick, 
I wish to stay, and sleep today, yeah. 
I'm so human, yeah yeah.
It's okay, yeah yeah,
For me to, feel this way, yeah yeah.
I'm still human, yeah yeah.
It's okay, yeah yeah, 
for me, to feel this way, yeah yeah.

Yeah, you, me, everyone.
I got a little temper,
but I'm a funny one. 
Yeah and when the beat went on, 
and it really ain't fucking hot enough,
you shoulda seen me runnin out the studio like forest gump.
Jo-jobs, sugar, and taxi get away,
trapped in the U.S. my accent is my giveaway. 
I need a bag of green, 
to make you go away.
And this is another day of my life and so I say...

I've been waiting hours for this,
I've made myself so sick.
I wish to stay,
and sleep today, yeah.
I'm so human, yeah yeah.
It's okay, yeah yeah, 
for me to, feel this way, yeah yeah.
I'm still human, yeah yeah.
It's okay, yeah yeah,
for me to, feel this way, yeah yeah.

(Ye-eh yeah yeah, ye-eh yeah yeah, ye-eh yeah yeah)  

Doesn't it feel much better,  (uh huh) 
when you've had a better day than yesterday? 
Doesn't it feel much better, (uh-huh)
when you've had a better day than yesterday? 
Doesn't it feel much better, (uh-huh)
when you've had a better day than yesterday? 
Doesn't it feel much better, (uh-huh)
when you've had a better day than yesterday? 

(yesterday, yesterday yesterday, yesterday)

I'm so human, yeah yeah.
It's okay, yeah yeah, 
for me to, feel this way, yeah yeah.
I'm still human, yeah yeah.
It's okay, yeah yeah, 
for me to, feel this way.---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
