S....O....V!!

I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it,ya
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it

BA-BA-BA BING BING BING BA-BA-BA BANG 
Do it freestyle mix the tango fannang
GO!!
So, move from the bar to the floor,
You don't do it do it do it do it raw
Do it in times of my metaphor, there's that dude that I met before
Oi, do it like be distorted
Telephone him up high, yes sorted
Tell little lies, what bear, little porkies
If it's all clear, all clear to ignore me

I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it

I never quite heard of a girl that could do it like this
You ain't never heard of a girl that could do it like this do it like this

I never quite heard of a girl that could do it like this
You ain't never heard of a girl that could do it like this do it like this

Think twice before I break dance, I might fall on my ass or break my arms.WHOOP!
Give my micro-stand a chance, I don't Cha Cha or Dance with The Stars

I was kickin' back in Ogulin
Tappin' my toes in tin while you were pogaling
You can never be crumping on a dime
Then Im on stage with my music

Pumpind, thumping, jumping, jumping
Jumping to the ring an do ya tin
By Lady Sovereign bring a tingaling tingaling
tingaling tingaling tingaling

I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it

I never quite heard of a girl that could do it like this
You ain't never heard of a girl that could do it like this do it like this

I never quite heard of a girl that could do it like this
You ain't never heard of a girl that could do it like this do it like this

You wanna dance, I bet you do,I bet you do,I bet you do
You wanna move, I bet you do,I bet you do,I bet you do
You wanna drink, I bet you do,I bet you do,I bet you do
You wanna drink, yeahh, just get me 2, just get me 2, just get me 2

I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it,ya
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it
I got you dancing got you doing it d-doing it---Lyrics submitted by Nicolle.
