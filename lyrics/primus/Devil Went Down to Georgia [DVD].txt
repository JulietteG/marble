The Devil went down to Georgia and he was lookin' for a soul to steal he was in a bind cause he was way behind so he was willin' to make a deal when he came across a young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot the devil jumped on a hickory stump said boy let me tell you what I bet you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player to and if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you you play a pretty good fiddle son but give the devil his due I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul I think I'm better than you the boy said my names Johnny and it my be a sin but I'll take you're bet you're gonna regret I'm the best there's ever been Johnny risen up your bow and play your fiddle hard cause hell is loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards and if you win you this shiny fiddle made of gold but if you loose the devil gets your soul the devil opens up his case and said I'll start this show fire flew from his finger tips as he risened up his bow he dragged the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss and a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this when the devil finished Johnny said well you play a pretty good fiddle son so sit down in that chair right there let me show you how it's done fire on the mountain run boys run the devil's in the house of the risen sun that chicken in the bread pan picken out dough granny does your dog bite no child no the devil bowed his head cause he knew that he been beat so he lay that golden fiddle at the ground at Johnny's feet Johnny said come back here if ever want to try again cause I told you once you son of a bitch I'm the best there's ever been he played fire on the mountain run boys run the devils in the house of the risen sun that chicken in the bread pan picken out dough granny does your dog bite no child no---Lyrics submitted by michael.
