It's in your head
They're telling you it's in your head
It's a figment of your imagination
It isn't there
They're telling you it isn't there
You're a victum of your infatuation
What do i think that it is i see
i keep asking myself
nothing like this has ever happened to me 
{chorus}
There's a perfect lover 
Running through my head
i can see her in my head
Perfect lover
Lover
They keep telling you
They keep telling you
It's just a fascination
Why do they lisren to what i am saying
And everyone tells you that she just isn't there
That it just could'nt be 
If they only knew how real she is to me 
{chorus}
Sometimes i can hear the cry
I hear it crying out
Your voice from deep inside
Inside
It's taking over me
Over me
I'm not looking through the eyes of a 
desperate stranger
What i envisionis so real
I don't want to change it
And sometimes i feel like she is standing right there
Like i can reach out and touch her
only i know how real she is to me
{chorus}---Lyrics submitted by Leila.
