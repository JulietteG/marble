why can't you see where we are going
why can't you see where we have been
you tell me the pain is still growingyou tell me who'll win 
I feel for you you know what I'm saying 
but I got to do what's right in my head

I've got to ride ride rocket ride
carry me quick to the one's who've cried
I'm a saint I'm a sinner but you decide
In desperate times sled sled rocket sled 
carry me quick to the one's who've bled
I'm a saint I'm a sinner and these are
Desperate Times.

I would give my soul to carry your burden
I would give my soul cause I know you still grieve
where will we go to hide from their blindness
where will we go if we don't both believe
bad blood rains down we've got to take cover
cold blood rains down who can find any peace---Lyrics submitted by pete.
