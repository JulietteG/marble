Made me grow
Then you cut me down
A north wind on a garden growin'
You made me think you were mine
Then you changed your mind
I'm lost as a feather
In a hurricane
There's no way to measure
If I'll ever ok, ok let me tell you
There's no good reason why
I can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
That's just a-how
It goes when your gone

You may not realize
All the lies at the time but
The truth will find you
That storm is gonna come
Gonna wash you away like Sodom and Gomorrah

There's no good reason why
We can't move on
I lay my heart on these tracks
When your train comes along

And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
That's just a-how
It goes when your gone

Go out in circles
Like an old golden bed
As cold as the pillow
By your empty nightstand
Then somethin' comes over me
I lose my head
I guess god did not make me
A one woman man

I'd have a lot to give
If I still gave a damn
That's just how
It goes when your gone

And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
But that's just how
It goes when your gone

And it was all alright
Now it's all all wrong
And that's just a-how
It goes when your gone
When your gone
When your long long gone---
