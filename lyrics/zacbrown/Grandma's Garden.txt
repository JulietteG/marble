Grandma had a garden in her backyard
She always had a way with things that grow
She'd be out there early in the springtime
Just as soon as she was sure it wouldn't snow
She said, I like to watch the seeds I've planted
Grow up into what they ought to be
I thought she was talking 'bout tomatoes
But she was talkin' 'bout her family

Grandma's garden, it grew up strong
'cause she weeded out whatever could go wrong
She would say, the straight & narrow is toughest row to hoe
Just remember what you reap is what you sow
Grandma's love is what made Grandma's garden grow

We all went to church last Sunday morning
The same one she attended sixty years
They asked if I could say some words about her
So I got up fightin' back tears
I said, I used to watch her clean the rocks out
And tie up every vine with love and care
That little piece of ground taught me some lessons
And without her then I wouldn't have a prayer

Grandma's garden, it grew up strong
'cause she weeded out whatever could go wrong
She would say, the straight & narrow is toughest row to hoe
Just remember what you reap is what you sow
Grandma's love is what made Grandma's garden grow

Some day when I have children of my own & I'm watchin' them play
Someday when they grow up, I want to hear them say...

Grandma's garden, it grew up strong
'cause she weeded out whatever could go wrong
She would say, the straight & narrow is toughest row to hoe
Just remember what you reap is what you sow
Grandma's love is what made Grandma's garden grow---
