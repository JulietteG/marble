I have lived in a junkyard, where the weeds eat up the rain
If you get anything there, even out of place
You know theres hell to pay
And he says, Youre as sick, as you are lovely, and in need of a hand
He tells me, you are never worthy
But I was just a child you see thats my reality 

He had a sick little girl, dirty and harmed
With a breast plate made of metal
Drives all day in a rusty Buick, feet dont reach the pedals 
Got a jar of flies, a fathers disguise, where his heart should be, her mouth is sown together
She screams with those eyes!
And he says, Shes as sick, as she is lovely and in need of my hand
He tells her, you are never worthy 
She was all alone you see That's her reality yeah

Shoulda been sleepin, shoulda been dreaming, but I wake up to broken glass
There'll be one more, empty desk, in my homeroom class
I got an old bone pocket knife, tight in my right hand
To save my poor mother, from the junk yard man!
And I say, hes as sick as he is lovely, and in need of a hand
And he will know hes not worthy
Cause he will die alone you see, thats his reality 

Im not sick, I am lovely, and hatred is the curse of man!
And I will not feel unworthy 
Cause Ive washed my hands you see, thats my reality---Lyrics submitted by Chris.
