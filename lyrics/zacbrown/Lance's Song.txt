Doin what you love has a high price to pay
Some put on a suit, but he ran the other way
His drums drown out the yuppies
And the ones who couldnt dream
Cause the freedom music gave him 
Was worth more than anything

They dont know what they got
Till its gone, like it or not
You live on love
You try to do whats right
Were all here a waitin
For our silver invitation
To the big band in the sky

Rolling down the windows
Trying hard to fight the sleep
Moneys never much
For a band in Tennessee
Another night of playing
To a crowd with no ears
Want to hear the songs they know
And fill their bellies full of beer

But they dont know what they got
Till its gone, like it or not
You live on love
You try to do whats right
Were all here a waitin
For our silver invitation
To the big band in the sky

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

And when he closed his eyes
Fell in into a dream that never dies
And when the thunder comes
You can hear his kick drum in the sky
Feel the rain far from our eyes

Cause we dont know what we got
Till its gone, like it or not
You live on love
You try to do whats right
For him theres no more waitin
Got his silver invitation
Just to do a little playin
For the big band in the sky

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh---Lyrics submitted by David.
