Shes got eyes that cut you, like a knife
And her lips that taste like sweet red wine.
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time.

Shes got a gentle way that puts me at ease
And when she walks in the room I can hardly breath
Got a devastating smile, knock a grown man to his knees.

Chorus
Shes got whatever it is.
It blows me away.
She's everything I wanna say to a woman 
but I couldn't find the words to say.
Shes got whatever it is.
Don't know what to do.
Because every time i try to tell her how I feel 
it comes out I LOVE YOU.
You got whatever it is.

You know I've never been the type 
that would ever wanna stay.
And bring em home at night. 
And their gone the next day.
But that all changed. 
When she walked into my life.

And people ask me why it is 
I tell em i don't know. 
There's just something bout the the woman
That makes my heart go haywire. 
And shes gonna be my wife.

Chorus
Shes got whatever it is.
It blows me away. 
She's everything I wanna say to a woman 
but I couldn't find the words to say.
Shes got whatever it is.
Don't know what to do.
Every time I try to tell her how I feel 
it comes out I LOVE YOU.
You got whatever it is.

When she loves me.
girl that's how I feel.
Because when she loves me
I'm on top of the world.
Because when she loves me.
I can live forever. 
Because when she loves me.
I am untouchable.

Shes got whatever it is.
It blows me away. 
Shes everything I wanna say to a woman 
but I couldn't find the words to say.
Shes got whatever it is.
Don't know what to do.
Because every time I try to tell her how i feel 
it comes out I LOVE YOU
I DO.
You got whatever it is.
ohhh you got whatever it is.---Lyrics submitted by Jacob.
