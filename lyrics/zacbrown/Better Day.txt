I  have lived in a junkyard where the weeds eat up the rain

You get anything there even out of place

You know theres hell to pay


(Chorus)
He says Im as  sick as I am lovely
And in need of a hand
He tells me Im never worthy
I was a child you see
Thats my reality



Sick little girl dirty and hard with a breast plate made of metal

She drives all day in a rusty buick and her feet dont reach the petal

She holds a jar of flies fathers disguise where his heart should be

Her mouth is sewn together

She screams with those eyes

(Chorus)
Shes as sick as she is lovely
And in need of a hand
Tells her shes never worthy
Shes all alone you see
Thats her reality


Should been sleepin shoulda been dreamin but I wake up to broken glass

Be one more empty desk in my homeroom class

Got an old bone pocket knife tight in my right hand

To save my poor mother from the junkyard man


(Chorus)
Hes as sick as he is lovely
And in need of a hand
He will know hes unworthy
He will die out on these streets
Thats his reality


Im not sick

I am lovely

Hatred is the curse of man

I will not feel unworthy

I have washed my hands you see

Thats my reality---Lyrics submitted by nikki.
