The smiles and the glances
How you measure your chances
Dont deny
Dont deny

Strong and pretentious
Blind to my senses
Dont deny
Dont deny
Dont deny me
Dont taint my heart

You deny my fears
You deny my tears
You deny a tender child
You deny my pride
You think Im defenceless
You take me for granted
You think Im defenceless
But I will rise above my weakness
You think Im defenceless
You dont deny the sun
The wind on your face
You dont deny the stars

The lies and the glances
The maddening offences
Dont deny
Dont deny
Retreats and advances
We all know the dances---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
