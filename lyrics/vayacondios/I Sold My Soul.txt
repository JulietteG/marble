I sold my soul to the devil
The first time you kissed me
I mistook hell for heaven
The first time I let you touch me
Now I'm just a litte toy in your hands
Like many before me
Feels like I'm walking on a rope of sand
Somebody save me
I even cancel all my secret rendez-vous
To sit alone by the phone
Waiting to hear from you
My friends don't call me no more
Say I'm no fun
Ignore me when I'm round
Talk about me when I'me gone
I don't know what's gonna happen
To my poor soul, Lord help me
Mama, your little girl is crying
Night and day, do something for me
If you can---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
