What a lonely feeling
When you're waking in the morning
Your mind in a haze
This lonely feeling
When you're reeling in the evening
I don't know, how long
This gonna keep on going on
I don't know, how long
This is gonna keep on going on
What a lonely feeling
When you've given up believing
Lost in a maze
This lonely feeling
When you're heart and soul is yearning
I don't know how long
This is gonna keep on going on
I don't know how long
This is gonna keep on going on
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going on (x2)
Baby, what are we gonna do
Me and you?
Baby, where will it lead us to
Me and you?
This lonely feeling
When you're reeling in the evening
I don't know how long
This is gonna keep on going on
I don't know how long
This is gonna keep on going on
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going
Got to keep on going on---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
