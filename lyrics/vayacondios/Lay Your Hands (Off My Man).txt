Lay your hands
Off my man
You don't even want him
You just want
What I have
Lay your hands
Off my man
You don't even want him
You just wanna
Take my place
A pretty girl floating in a room
Wrapped in her innocence and her cheap perfume
Fluttering around men like a moth around the light
Think she won't burn herself, well I just think she might
A little girl not a woman yet
Spiteful little eyes that say watch out I'm a threat
Lay your hands
Off my man
You don't even want him
You just want
What I have
Lay your hands
Off my man
Don't you, don't you
Don't you girl, don't you dare
You can call me sweetie and other charming names
Yet you give him the eye while I'm standing next to him
Don't like your ways besides I got my pride
Would you mind me girl stepping aside
Oh! no you don't understand, you're acting amazed
Don't take me for a fool girl, fade away---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
