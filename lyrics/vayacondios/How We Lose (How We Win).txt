When he left you
You thought that you would die
You saw the colours fade as he walked away
Your hope is willing
Your heart is crying out
Youre just wondering how you will survive

How we lose
How we win
How we choose
As the night begins
You and her
Or me and him
We dont know what life will bring
But I tell you the future is waiting
And someone will find you

You dont know what youre missing, Mister

Now hes left you
See your tears have dried
Now the colours shine brighter day by day
Your hope is willing
Your heart no longer cries
Skies are clearing the sun is on the rise---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
