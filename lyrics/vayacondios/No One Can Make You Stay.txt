The storm is getting closer
Till its over talking louder aint no use
Discussing from the morning till the evening
Leads you slowly to abuse

Some words are meant to hurt
And cut you deeper than will ever cut the truth
So dont say dont say 
I never cared for you
No dont say dont say
Im disrespecting you
Dont say that you are chained

Cos you can always go away
No one can make you stay
Just walk away
Dont wanna see you tamed
But I can say
Ive loved you all the way
Until this day

Gotta get it over
Cos I cant take it no more

Our love is getting colder
And your shoulder aint no longer my refuge
The cards are out of order
Every border has been crossed without excuse
These wars are fought for nothing
Cant you see that I am pleading for a truce
So dont say dont say 
I never cared for you
Oh dont say dont say 
Im disrespecting you
Dont say that you are chained
Cos you can always go away
No one can make you stay
Just walk away
Dont wanna see you tamed
But I can say
Ive loved you all the way
Until this day

Gotta get it over
Cos I cant take it no more---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
