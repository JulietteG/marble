Come on handsome
Put a quarter in that thing again
It don't matter
If the song is the same
Pull me closer
You and I have nothing to explain
'Cos tonight the wind is blowin'
And the sea is running high
All you troubles little darling
Let them drift with the tide
There's a full moon above us
Shining out so bright
Why worry about tomorrow?
You're young and you're travelling light
Come on sailor
Put in a quarter in that thing again
It son't matter
If it's alwaus the same
Hold me closer
You and I may never meet again
Maybe somewhere
Down old memory lane
'Cos tonight the wind is blowin'
And the sea is running high
All you troubles little darling
Let them drift with the tide
There's a full moon above us
Shining out so bright
Why worry about tomorrow?
You're young and you're travelling light---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
