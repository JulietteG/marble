He said baby, what's your name
Are you new in this town?
Since you walked in things don't look the same
How about sticking around?
The place was dark and the band played loud
His voice sounded kind of dry
He said: who's that guy with the funny smile?
She said:
He's just a friend of mine (x 3)
They talked a little, drank a lot
As the evening went by
The place got crowded and the air too hot
He said: Lets go out for a while
The night was clear and the wind was soft 
As they walked side by side
He said: who's that guy following us about?
She said:
He's just a friend of mine (x 3)
He was nice and gentle, still rough enough
To keep her satisfied
She said: hold it baby, it gets too much
I feel like I'm gonna die
He took her home in the early mornin'
She said: please do come inside
He said: who's that guy in the dressing gown?
She said:
He's just a friend of mine (x 3)
He said who's that guy in the dressing gown
She said baby don't you mind
He's just a friend, just a friend,
He's just a friend of mine
