Call him anything you can
A sinner or a saint
Call him a boozer
A winner or a loser
He's still a man
He may be proud
He may be fame
An emperor or a slave
He may be leader
A liar and a cheater
He's still a man
He may be pulling on the chains
Of power and of fame
He may have lost his dreams
He may have lost his faith
Fearful or brave
He'll meet his fate one day
Call him anything you can
A traitor or a friend
Call him a hero
A nothing or a zero
He's still a man
He may be pulling on the chains
Of power and of fame
He may have lost his dreams
He may have lost his faith
Fearful or brave
He'll meet his fate oneday
Call him anything you can
A traitor a friend
Call him a hero
A nothing or a zero
He's still a man
Call him a hero
A nothing or a zero
He's still a man
He's just a man
Who does the best he can
He's just a man
He's nothing but a man---Lyrics submitted by Jenny.
