A,B, A, B, C, D...

The moon up above, it shines down upon our skin
The whispering words, The scream of our raging sin
We all want the stuff, thats found in our wildest dreams 
It gets kind of rough, in the back of our limosuine
chours:
Thats what we are, we all want a love bizarre
Thats what we are, we all want a love bizarre

The strawberry mind, a body thats built for two
A kiss on the spine, we do things we never do
Come swallow the pride, the joy of the ivory tower
The bats on the rough, make love on a bed of flowers
chours:
Thats what we are, we all want a love bizarre
Thats what we are, we all want a love bizarre

The moon up above, shines down on upon our skin
The whispering words, The scream of our raging sin
We all want the stuff, thats found in our wildest dreams
It gets kind of rough, in the back of our limosuine---Lyrics submitted by tasha.
