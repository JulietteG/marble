If you would only let me,
I could show you how to love
Take our time, let all it go
If youd would only let me
I could show you how to cry
In your darkest hour
I would lead you through the fire

But you wont let me
You wont let me
I dont want to say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
And Id do anything
Yes, Id do anything
If youd only let me

With your hand in mine
I would show you how to laugh
Nothing heavy, nothing serious
Just forget about all that
Youve been stepping back
I want to be your friend
You tear down the walls that surround you
And build you back up again

But you wont let me
No, you wont let me
I dont want to say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
And Id do anything
Yes, Id do anything

So tonight, stay with me
I know I could change your mind

But you wont let me
You wont let me
No, I dont want to say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
But you wont let me
No, you wont let me

I dont want to say goodbye
I just want to give it one more try
But you wont let me
No you wont let me
Id do anything for you
Id do anything for you

But you wont let me
No, you wont let me
You wont let me---Lyrics submitted by luz bejar.
