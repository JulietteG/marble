Standing in a line
Wonder why it don't move
Tryna get a hand
Watching people break the rules
And maybe the man in charge
Doesn't like my face
But then this world's not always good

And nothing's real but love
Nothing's real but love
No money, no house, no car,
Can beat love

They watch us open-mouthed
As we joke around like fools
See who can be the worst
Watch what I can do
But then the door gets slammed,
Slammed right in my face
And I guess this world's not always good

And nothing's real but love
Nothing's real but love
No house, no car, no job
Can beat love

It won't fill you up
No money, no house, no car
Is like love

La la la la la la la la
Yeaaah

I put it all away
Holding it back for a rainy day
But what if that day don't come
I need love

No money, no house, no car
Is like love

It don't fill you up
It won't build you up
It won't fill you up
It's not love!

And nothing's real but love
No money, no house, no car
Is like love

Nothing's real but love

No money, no house, no car
Is like love---
