Die, mother fucker die
I want to see you cry
And then I'll watch you die

I want to hurt you, torture and desert you
Take a hot poker and stick it where the Sun don't shine..then watch you die

Cause I, I'm having a bad day
So get out of my way
Or you will pay and you'll pay with your Life

I, I'm having a bad day
So what else can I say
I just wanna kill and be killed just the Same

Cause my day sucks ass

Die, mother fucker die
I'll burn out both your eyes
And fill the sockets full of lye

I'll carve out your skull and turn into a 
Bowl that I'll eat cereal with while I Watch the Flinstones
And I, I'll do it with a smile

Cause I, I'm having a bad day
So get out of my way
Or you will pay and you'll pay with your Life
I, I'm having a bad day
So what else can I say
I just want to kill and be killed just the Same
Cause my day sucks ass

I don't want to work
I don't want to pay bills
And I don't want to grow old
And I don't want to be poor
I don't want to drive in traffic
I don't want to deal with dating
I don't want to stand in line
I don't want to pay any taxes

Die, mother fucker die
Why won't you just die?
And get out of my life

I want to move to some deserted desert island where I will live up coconuts and everything will be fine all of the time
Cause I, I'm having a bad day
So get out of my way
Of you will pay and you will pay with your life
I, I'm having a bad day
So what else can I say
I just want to kill and be killed just the same

Cause my day sucks ass---Lyrics submitted by olivia.
