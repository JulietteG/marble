Well I met the Queen of Iowa
She was dyin' on a couch in the suburbs
And with all of the things she was dyin' of
She was more alive than the others

She was pretty as a flower in a crystal vase
That lights up the room as it withers away
She opened her eyes when she heard the music play

CHORUS:
We sang a hymn to the rythym of the river that flows
Down from the mountain of the Holy Ghost
Into the souls of those who know His name
Like the Queen of Iowa
She was the Queen of Iowa

Well her majesty was all ablaze
She was burning hot but not consumed
Our shoes removed in that holy place
In the hallowed ground of the living room
Well I bowed down low and I kissed her hand
And we raised a toast to the promise land
I saw the tears of joy run down her face

(CHORUS)

I can see my illusions scatter
Everytime she drew a breathe
I can see the heart of the matter
The heart is a matter of life and death
I'll never be the same

Well we sing about oceans of love again
She stared past the ceiling and the sky above
Two court musicians it was me and Ben
We were singing for the Queen of Iowa

We sang a hymn to the rythym of the river that flows
Down from the the mountain of the Holy Ghost
Into the souls of those who know His name
There was a peace like a river in a valley of bones
That fills the valley up and carries 'em home
To come alive again in the river of grace

Like the Queen of Iowa
She was the Queen of Iowa
Long-live the Queen of Iowa
She was the Queen of Iowa---Lyrics submitted by Jason.
