Like a dream you can't explain
Love can chase the bidding of your heart
Like the sunshine in the rain
Love can make your whole world fall apart
But i want it now
I just wanna spend my life with you
Time will show me how
Suddenly everything has turned me inside out
Suddenly loves the thing that I can't live without

You're my dream, my love, my life,
I just wanna spend my lfe with you
You're the one who makes me smile
I just wanna spend my life with you
Gotta love somehow
I just wanna spend my life with you
You can show me how
Suddenly everything has turned me inside out
Suddenly loves the thing that I can't live without

You're my dream my love, my life,
I just wanna spend my life with you
You're the one who makes me smile
I just wanna spend my lfe with you.

What have you done to me
Is this how it's meant to be?
Can't control this feeling in my heart
I can see paradise
Glowing inside your eyes
And I know you feel it in your heart
But I want it now
I just wanna spend my life with you
Time will show me how
Suddenly everything has turned me inside out
Suddenly loves the thing that I can't live without

You're my dream, my love, my life,
I just wanna spend my life with you
You're the one who makes me smile
I just wanna spend my life with you

Oh... Love is a crazy thing
Something that you wanna see
And the worlds like deep inside your soul
When somebody comes along
Together you sing this song
You just let the music take control
And I want it now
I just wanna spend my life with you
Time will show me how
Suddenly everything has turned me inside out
Suddenly loves a thing that I can't live without

You're my dream, my love, my life,
I just wanna spend my life with you
You're the one who makes me smile
I just wanna spend my life with you...
You...---Lyrics submitted by jeevan.
