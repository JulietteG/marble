I never felt like this before 
Try to hold it back and I feel it even more 
Sweat drips down my spine and my knees are weak 
I can not move, I can not speak 

But then you came and I held it together again 
I managed to stumble through 
Fifty thousand voices singing in the rain 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to 
I'll swim the seven seas 
I'll be the one to hold your torch again 
I'll do anything you asked of me 

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to 
I'll swim the seven seas 
I'll be the one to hold your torch again 
I'll do anything you asked of me 

I never knew how proud I'd feel just standing in the rain. These three 
Words mean everything to me and I'd sing it again and again.
'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to 
I'll swim the seven seas 
I'll be the one to hold your torch again 
I'll do anything you asked of me 

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to 
I'll swim the seven seas 
I'll be the one to hold your torch again 
I'll do anything you asked of me 

Well the blue and the white of the flag shines bright and it's blowing 
There for me. With my hand on my heart, the honest truth there's nowhere 
I'd rather be. 

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to 
I'll swim the seven seas 
I'll be the one to hold your torch again 
I'll do anything you asked of me 

'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to 
I'll swim the seven seas 
I'll be the one to hold your torch again 
I'll do anything you asked of me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
