We believe in the one true God 
We believe in Father Spirit Son 
We believe that good has won 

And all of the people of God sang along 

Amen

We are free He died and lives again 
We will be a people free from sin 
We'll be free a kingdom with no end 

And all of the people of God sang along

Our father who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us
Lord lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom, power and the glory forever
