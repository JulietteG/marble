Sunset stains your blue eyes orange
screw the lock just pop the door hinge
we're getting in somehow
conflict hits you get all apathetic
used to didn't but now you let it
throw your dead bolt tight
but we're getting in somehow

Why point out the pointlessness?
to say it out loud would be self-prophetic
never vocally admit it
though we both know
we're never getting in no how
but we're getting in somehow

Petty crimes in 48 states
known you for so long
spit out the chit-chat
only talk utilitarian
I used to be so good
at putting your mind to ease
you were the best at getting petted
I won't let us call this
crime wave dead not yet.
we should have gotten in somehow
but we're getting in somehow.---Lyrics submitted by Rubisco.
