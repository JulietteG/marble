and i wanna wake up with your white balck sun
and i wanna wake up in your world of no pain
but i just suffer and hope to die some day
while you are numb all the way

then i hate it..i know i can feel
but when you love and know its not real.. no
then i hate it. i know i can feel
but when you love and know its not real no

and now i reside at this wicked fuckin world
on its way to hell
you live in a dead and  i hope to join you too
i know what to do and not to live well

and i hate it.. i know i can feel
but then you love and know its not real no
then i hate it i know i can feel
but when you love and know its not real no

shoot myself to love you
if i loved myself i would shoot you
ha ha ha ha yeahhh
shoot myself to love you
if l loved myself i would shoot you
ha ha ha ha yeahh
shoot myself to love you
if l loved myself i would shoot you

shoot myself to love you 
if i loved myself i would shoot you

if i loved myself i would shoot you
if i love myself i would  shoot you---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
