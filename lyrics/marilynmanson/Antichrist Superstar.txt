You built me up with your wishing hell
I didn't have to sell you
You threw your money in the pissing well
You do just what they tell you

Repent, that's what I'm talking about
I shed the skin to feed the fake
Repent, that's what I'm talking about
Who's mistake am I anyways
Cut the head off, grows back hard
I am the hydra, now you'll see your star

Prick your finger it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread his wings
The time has come for bitter things

Repent, that's what I'm talking about
I shed the skin to feed the fake
Repent, that's what I'm talking about
Who's mistake am I anyways
Cut the head off, grows back hard
I am the hydra, now you'll see your star

Time has come it is quite clear
Our antichrist is almost here---Lyrics submitted by Kari.
