i peek into the hole
i struggle for control
the children love the show
but they fail to see the anguish in my eyes

fail to see the anguish in my eyes

i scratch around the brim
i let my mind give in yeah yeah
the croud begins to grin
but they seem to scream 
when darkness fills my eyes

seem to scream when drakness fill my eyes
its no suprise

fail to see the tragic
turn it into magic

my big top tricks will always make you happy yeah
but we all know that the hat is wearing me

my bag is in the hat its filled with this and that
my visions getting fat  the rabbits just a monkey in disquise

skulls and pills and needles dance before our eyes
they will bite the hand if it is slower than
the quickness of their scrutinizing eyes

aaaaah yeah yeah

fail to see the tragic turn it into magic

my big top tricks will always make you happy
but we all knew the hat is wearing me

chicanery will always make you happy
but we all know the hat is wearing me---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
