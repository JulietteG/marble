what you want well  thats what you get
though your life is shit

you never accepted 
dont care you were there

i may be currupt i  believe i am there
you haunt your selves in your lazy sheilds

you wont let me in since your weak
you never gave me a chance to be me

what if i fuckin tackeld your faith
now i'll show you that you werent wrong
now i'll destroy you once and for all

not gonna break me staying tall
never falling i got control

why are they blaming the blame
when i get at you your gonna pay
sorry this is what you deserve

i am not sorry i am not sorry
this is what you deserve
im not sorry im not sorry
cant stop me though you taught me 
im not sorry im not sorry you cant stop me though you taught me---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
