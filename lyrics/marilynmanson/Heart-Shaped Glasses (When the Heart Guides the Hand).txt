She reminds me of the one in school
When i was cutting,She was dressed in white
And i couldn't take my eyes off her
But that's not what i took off that night
And she will never cover up what we did with her dress,no
She said"Kiss me; it'll heal but it won't forget.
And i don't mind you keeping me on pins and needles.
If i could stick to you,and you stick me,too.
Don't break,don't break my heart
And i won't brake your heart-shaped glasses
Little girl,little girl,you should close your eyes
That blue is getting my high
Don't break,don't break my heart
And i won't break your heart-shaped glasses
Little girl,little girl,you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high,making me low 
That blue is getting me high,making me low
She reminds of the one i knew
That cut up the negatives of my life
I couldn't take my hands off
She wouldn't let me be anywhere but inside 
I don't mind you keeping me on pins and needles
If i could stick you,and you could stick me,too.
Just don't break,don't break my heart
And i won't break your heart-shaped glasses
Little girl,little girl,You should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high
Don't break,don't break my heart
And i won't break your heart-shapped glasses
Little girl,little girl,you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high,making me low
And she'll never cover up the what we did with a dress,no
She said"Kiss me; it'll heal but it won't forget
And i don't mind you keeping me on pins and needles
If i could stick you,and you stick me,too.
Don't break,don't break my heart
And i won't break your heart-shapped glasses
Little girl,little girl,you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high
Don't break my heart,don't break my heart
And i won't break your heart-shapped glasses
Little girl,Little girl,you should close your eyes
That blue is getting me high,making me low---Lyrics submitted by Vicenta.
