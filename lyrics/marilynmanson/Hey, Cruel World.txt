Hey cruel world
Don't have what it takes
Don't need your faith
You got fucking fate
(x2)

Creator
Preserver
Destroyer
Ask which one i am
There's no drugged-out devil's
Or squared-halo angel's
Walking among us
I am among no one(x3)
No one

Hey cruel world
You don't have what it takes
Don't need your faith
You got fucking fate
Fate(x3)

The center of the universe
Cannot exist
When there are no
No edges
(x2)

Hey cruel world
Don't have what it takes
Don't need your faith
You got fucking fate
Fate(x3)

I am among no one(x3)
No one

Hey cruel world
Don't have what it takes
Don't need your faith
You got fucking fate
Fate(x9)---Lyrics submitted by Vincent Weaver.
