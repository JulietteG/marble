The ants are in the sugar, muscles atrophied
We're on the other side, the screen is us and we're tv
Spread me open, sticking to my pointy ribs
Are all your infants in abortion cribs
I was born into this, everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear

Pray until you're number, asleep from all your pain
Your apple has been rotting, tomorrow's turned up dead
I have it all and I have no choice but to
I'll make everyone pay and you will see
You can kill yourself now, because you're dead in my mind
The boy that you loved is the monster you fear

Peel off all those eyes, crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all your children, to camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters, play unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream, the cut that never heals
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream, just a dream

I am so tangled in my sins that I can not escape
I am so tangled in my sins that I can not escape

Pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed
Someone had to go this far
I was born into this, everything turns to shit
The boy that you loved is the man that you fear

Peel off all those eyes, crawl into the dark
You've poisoned all your children, to camouflage your scars
Pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
Pray your life was just a dream, the cut that never heals
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream, just a dream

The world in my hands, there's no one left to hear you scream
There's no one left for you---Lyrics submitted by Kari.
