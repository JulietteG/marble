The fruit is speechless 
before our sorceries 
the party has just begun 
Timelapse and dancing and rotting in place, 
and we have reached the high end of low 
The high end of low 
The high end of low

You can take me, 
The grave can take me 
The earth is waiting to eat us alive 
I love you damaged, 
I need human wreckage 
I have to look up 
just to see Hell

Fallen, fallen, fallen from grace 
now for you 
this is why you should run 
Fallen, fallen, fallen from grace 
now for you 
this is why you should run

The core of a woman 
is where her body 
chooses to revolve like a corpse 
centrifugal, melted under the skin, 
bacteria 
into the napalm heart I explode, 
I explode 
I explode

You can take me, 
The grave can take me 
The earth is waiting to eat us alive 
I love you damaged, 
I need human wreckage 
I have to look up 
just to see Hell

Fallen, fallen, fallen from grace 
now for you 
this is why you should run 
Fallen, fallen, fallen from grace 
now for you 
this is why you should run

The light shines in the darkness 
and the darkness will never understand it 
The light shines in the darkness 
and the darkness will never understand it 
The light shines in the darkness 
and the darkness will never understand it 
The light shines in the darkness 
and the darkness will never understand it

You can take me, 
The grave can take me 
The earth is waiting to eat us alive 
I love you damaged, 
I need human wreckage 
I have to look up 
just to see Hell

You can take me, 
The grave can take me 
The earth is waiting to eat us alive 
I love you damaged, 
I need human wreckage 
I have to look up 
just to see Hell---Lyrics submitted by april.
