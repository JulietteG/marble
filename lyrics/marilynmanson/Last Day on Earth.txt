yesterday was a million years ago
all the past lives i've played and asshole

now i found you its almost to late
and this earth feels obliviating

we are trimbling in our crutches
high and dead our skin is glass

im so empty here without you
i crack my xerox hands

i know its the last day on earth
we'll be togeather while the planet dies
i know its the last day on earth
we'll never say goodbye

and the dogs slide each other softly
love burns in casualties
we are damaged provider modules
spit the seeds at out childrens feet

and im so empty here without you 
i know they want me dead

i know its the last day on earth
we'll be togeather when the planet dies
i know its the last day on earth
we'll never say goodbye

i know its the last day on earth
we'll be togeather while the planet dies

i know its the last day one earth
we'll never say goodbye

i know its the last day on earth
we'll be togeather while the planet dies

i know its the last day on earth 

we'll never say goodbye
we'll never say goodbye
we'll never say goodbye---Lyrics submitted by jessica.
