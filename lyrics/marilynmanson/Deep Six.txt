You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus
Youd better watch yourself
You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus
Youd better watch yourself
Youd better watch yourself

Its like a stranger had a key, came inside of my mind
And moved all my things around
He didnt know snakes cant eat a brain
Cant try to break the psyche down

Its in my half-frozen wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our plan
Do you like our plan

Deep six, six, six feet deep
Deep six, six, six feet deep

Its like a stranger had a key, came inside of my mind
And moved all my things around
He didnt know snakes cant eat a brain
Cant try to break the psyche down

Its in my half-frozen wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our plan
Do you like our plan

Its in my half-frozen wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our plan
Do you like our plan

Deep six, six, six feet deep
Deep six, six, six feet deep

You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus
Youd better watch yourself
You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus
Youd better watch yourself
Youd better watch yourself

Love is evil
Con is confidence
Eros is sore
Sin is sincere

Sin is sincere
Sin is sincere
Sin is sincere

Deep six, six, six feet deep
Deep six, six, six feet deep

You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus
Youd better watch yourself
You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus
Youd better watch yourself---
