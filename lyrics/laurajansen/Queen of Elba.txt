I spent a long time hiding 
Believing that I was alone 
Under the surface I was stone 

When the walls that I built in the end 
Just knocked me down 
I let the earth pull at my bones 

Closing the distance 
I'm reaching out 
It starts with a whisper 
Can you hear me now? 
All the lies we spoke 
And dreams we broke 
Underneath it all 
Beats the same heart 
Beats the same, same heart 
Beats the same heart 

We spent such a long time trying 
Rolling the rock up the hill 
With just a trail of dust behind 
Oh that city we built is a song 
That calls us out 
And we will sing it as we climb 

Closing the distance 
I'm reaching out 
It starts with a whisper 
But becomes a shout 
All the lies we spoke 
And dreams we broke 
Underneath it all 
Beats the same heart 
Beats the same, same heart 
Beats the same heart 

Ooooh 

Beats the same heart 

Underneath it all 
Beats the same heart---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
