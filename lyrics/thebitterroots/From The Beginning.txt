Let me take you back to where it all began
Take off your clothes my dear
Show me the body you promised to me
For the first time I am as nervous as you are

Our bodies so entwined, floating out of time oh
How can this be real, all these things I feel are so

What is the price for your pleasure to night
Everlasting love without sickness fear or spite
Take me in your hand and guide me to
The place where you want to feel my love for you

Combining our two souls never growing old
So much for me to tell, feeling overwhelmed

Pressed against you skin, feeling deep within
Our bodies so entwined, floating out of time
Levitate above the ground, your breath and mine is the only sound
How can this be real, all these things I feel are so---Lyrics submitted by Jeff Stetson.
