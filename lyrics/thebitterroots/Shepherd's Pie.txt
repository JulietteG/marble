The Liars they're trying,
but their eyes are denying,
they don't think that we know their ways.
Well if I did now I wouldn't tell you,
'cause it's not sound advice anyway.

But hey don't you worry,
it will all trickle down.
From the crocodile tears
of these sick clowns.

300 for 30 well that's filthy dirty,
it's not a good deal for you or me.
Well I wouldn't know cause I'm not a rich man,
but that's not the point anyway.

You'll get what you get
and that's just what they'll give you,
you just must have faith can't you see.
If you don't like it,
well that's just too bad,
you can always play the lottery.---Lyrics submitted by Jeff Stetson.
