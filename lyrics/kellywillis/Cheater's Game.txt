I can fake it for awhile
Til I fall apart in style
After all rock bottoms not too far down

A little heartache, a little pain
A little stick opens the vein
A dash of salt for the wound that barely makes a sound 

Im not ashamed of bein afraid of losin you
What more can I lose?
But its aa cheaters game
Youre just breakin me down
When Im broken in two
Is that so easy to do?

I come runnin every time you call
I catch you when you fall
I remember every little line on your face

I get it, its plain to see
Every way that she aint me
But did you really have to take her down this way?

Im not ashamed of bein afraid of losin you
What more can I lose?
But its aa cheaters game
Youre just breakin me down
When Im broken in two
Is that so easy to do?

You had to let me down
Whyd you have to let me down?

Im not ashamed of bein afraid of losin you
What more can I lose?
But its aa cheaters game
Youre just breakin me down
When Im broken in two
Is that so easy to do?

I come runnin every time you call
I catch you when you fall
I remember every little line on your face---Lyrics submitted by Debbie Prince.
