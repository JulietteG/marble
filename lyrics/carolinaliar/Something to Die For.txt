Peel me off the hook,
That's something to die for
Heal me, help me see
What the hell did I lie for?
I'm fighting private wars again,
Just second thoughts
Of where and when
So peel me off the hook,
That's something to die for

Won't you see it in your heart,
You should know you always
Played your part real good,
Oh yeah
That's something to die for
That's something to die for

Well, you know me,
I never learn
I'm holding on to sacred words
So peel me off the hook,
That's something to die for

Won't you see it in your heart,
You should know you always
Played your part real good,

If it hurts, who'll be there?
Who'll be standing by the shore?
You will see how the waves wash away
All the dirt
That's something to die for
That's something to die for

Won't you see it in your heart,
Oh, Don't you know you 
Played the part real good

Won't you see it in your heart,
You should know you always
Played your part real good,

In the end I'll be there,
I'll be standing by your side,
We will see how the tide hides away
All the dirt
That's something to die for
That's something to die for---Lyrics submitted by Shirley.
