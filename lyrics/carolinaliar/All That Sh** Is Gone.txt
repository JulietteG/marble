I never got it right,
That's how this breaks down
I never see things through
I always carry the weight for you,
For you
And now I hesitate
With every step I take
I fear my back might break
If I don't leave today
Always trying to please everyone
That I met and I ended up
Losing it all

But, all that sh** is gone
La la la la
All that sh** is gone
La la la la

I guess I felt abused
Is that something you choose?
In a cheap disguise,
I did everything for you
Always trying to please everyone
That I met and I ended up 
Losing it all

But, all that sh** is gone
La la la la
All that sh** is gone
La la la la

All that sh** is gone
La la la la
All that sh** is gone
La la la la
La la la la

I never got it right
Always carried the weight for you---Lyrics submitted by Shirley.
