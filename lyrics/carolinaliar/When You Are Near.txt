When you are near me
Carolina liar
4:01

Frame ghost left perfume on pillow
room without a halo
loosing my sleep
almost on and off in echos
time is passing so slow
dragging me deep
i can make anything out of might have beens
will tomorrow bring all into light?

When you are near me
When you are here i see
All that i am made of
And all that i have
When you are near

Way late television headache
Bursting into day break losing my sleep
I don't fear anything in this place we're in 
Will tomorrow bring all into light?

When you are near me 
When you are here i see 
All that i am made of 
And all that i have
And all that i have

When you are near me
When you are here i see
All that i am maybe 
You're all that i have
You're all that i am

I can't see anything in the dark 
but then, your reflection brings all into light

When you are near me
When you are here i see
All that i am made of 
And all that i have

When you are near me 
When you are here i see
All that i am maybe
Youre all that i have
Youre all that i am---Lyrics submitted by kara.
