All that I've found through the ups and the downs
Is that I'd have it no other way
Life in the raw is both fragile and strong
Its both lovely and ugly the same
Who can attest that when they're at their best
Oh their worst is still crouching close behind
Its coming to peace with the darkness in me
That allows the true light inside to shine

So let it go for we are still far from home
Though your try and you try to escape
To live and to love will always be dangerous
But it's better than playing it safe

We are composed of a symphony of notes
Every life is as music to His ears
I'll play my melody be it haunting be it sweet
Unashamed of what anyone might hear

So when the load breaks your back and your will
You must still keep your heart in the game
To live and to love will always be dangerous
But it's better than playing it safe

So let it go when it don't feel like home
When inside is your only escape
To live and to love will always be dangerous
But would you want it any other way?---Lyrics submitted by DanaCanarick.
