Hail gladdening light, of Your pure glory poured
Who is the immortal Father, heavenly, blest
O Holiest of Holies, Jesus Christ our Lord

And now we've come to the sun's hour of rest
The lights of evening round us shine
We hymn the Father, Son, Spirit divine

Worthiest art thou at all times to be sung
O with undefiled tongue
Son of our God, giver of life, alone
Son of our God, giver of life, alone
Son of our God, giver of life, alone

Therefore in all the world
Thy glories, Lord, thine own---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
