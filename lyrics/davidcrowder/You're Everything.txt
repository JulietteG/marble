Verse 1
You're everything
I could want, that I could need
If I could see You want me, could I believe?
'Cause You're perfectly all I want and all I need
If I could just feel Your touch, could I be free?

Pre-chorus1
Why do You shine so? Can a blind man see?
Why do You call?
Why do You beckon me?
Can the deaf hear the voice of love?
Would You have me come?
Can the cripple run?
Are You the one?

Chorus x2
Raise me up from this grave
Touch my tongue and then I'll sing
Heal my limbs then joyfully I'll run to You

Verse2
You're everything
I could want and I could need
I can just feel your touch and I can't breathe

Pre-Chorus2
And how you shine so the blind can see
And how You call out, You beckoned me
The deaf hear the voice of love
You bid me come and the cripple run
Oh Youre The One

Chorus x2
Raise me up from this grave
Touch my tongue and then I'll sing
Heal my limbs then joyfully I'll run to You

'Cause Youre Everything
Youre Everything
Youre Everything
Youre Everything

Ending x6
And I'm alive and I'll sing
And I'm alive and I'm free---Lyrics submitted by Paul.
