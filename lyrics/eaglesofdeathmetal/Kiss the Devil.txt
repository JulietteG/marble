Who'll love the devil?...
Who'll song his song?...
Who will love the devil and his song?...
I'll love the devil!...
I'll sing his song!...
I will love the devil and his song!...
Who'll love the devil?...
Who'll kiss his tongue?...
Who will kiss the devil on his tongue?...
I'll love the devil!...
I'll kiss his tongue!...
I will kiss the devil on his tongue!...
Who'll love the devil?...
Who'll sing his song?...
I will love the devil and his song!...
Who'll love the devil?...
Who'll kiss his tongue?...
I will kiss the devil on his tongue!...
Who'll love the devil?...
Who'll sing his song?...
I WILL LOVE THE DEVIL AND SING HIS SONG!...---
