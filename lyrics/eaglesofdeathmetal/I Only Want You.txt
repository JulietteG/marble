When I feel like you get too close I put you right down
I never really leave I just slip away
And it's not my purpose to break your spirit
I'm not really interested in what's in your heart
I don't want you to fall in love now so please don't start

I only want you
I only want you
I only want you
I only want you

I know that it's terribly cruel but then I like it
Because you tried to love me I just can't stay
And I'm not gonna lie just to spare you feelings
'Cause watching you suffer feels much better to me
I'm about to lay destruction on you
I'm not the lover man that you want me to be
I said well...

I only want you
I only want you
I only want you
I only want you

Now you see once you get too close
I put you right down
I never really leave I just slip away
But it's not my purpose to break your spirit
I'm not really interested in what's in your heart
But now I have to lay destruction on you
I'm not the lover man that you want me to be
I said well...

I only want you
I only want you
I only want you
I only want you---
