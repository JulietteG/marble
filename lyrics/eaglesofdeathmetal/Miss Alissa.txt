You know I try so hard
But I think you don't see
Cos' I'm moving so fast
We call it rock n rollin'
My weapon seems useless
Cos' your on to me
You are impossible to read
You're always straight controllin'

Oh oh oh Miss Allisa!

Gonna do a voodoo dance until
You feel my power now!
You know I feel so smooth
I'm always struttin' when in motion
Make the little girls dance
Cos' I'm rock n rollin'
It really doesn't matter
If you're hard to please
Cos' when you give me your smile
I'm yours for straight controllin'---
