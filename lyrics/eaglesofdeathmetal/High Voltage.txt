it opens right on time
shes just a hollywood lie
yeah we're gettin freaky in the shadows of the night
she loves rock n roll yeah the girls high voltage
she'll have you suckin on your finger
thats nasty
from the prayer to wa-langa
yeah we're gettin sneaky in the shadows of the lime light
she's hot but she loves rock n roll
she's hot but she loves rock n roll
she's hot but she loves rock n roll
the girls high voltage
she's always on time
she's always on time
she's always on time
she's always on time
she's always on time
she's like a sweet transister 
you knows i missed her
we're gettin on high
you want it comin from the east side
i wanna be the showpiece of the nasty boy collection
she's hot but she loves rock n roll
she's hot but she's a sweet transister
she's hot but she loves rock n roll
she's hot but she's like a sweet transister
you know i kissed her
she's always right on time yeah whoa
she's just a hollywood lie yeah whoa
yeah we're gettin freaky in the shadows of the lime light
you know i kissed her the girl's high voltage
she's hot but she loves rock n roll
she's hot but she loves rock n roll
she's hot but she loves  it!---Lyrics submitted by Alexis.
