Don't breathe too deep
Don't think all day
Dive into work
Drive the other way
That drip of hurt
That pint of shame
Goes away
Just play the game

You're living in America
At the end of the millenium

You're living in America
Leave your conscience at the tone

And when you're living in America
At the end of the millenium
You're what you own

ROGER
The filmmaker cannot see

MARK
And the songwriter cannot hear

ROGER
Yet I see Mimi everywhere

MARK
Angel's voice is in my ear

ROGER
Just tighten those shoulders

MARK
Just clench your jaw til you frown

ROGER
Just don't let go

BOTH
Or you may drown

You're living in America
At the end of the millenium
You're living in America
Where it's like the twilight zone

And when you're living in America
At the end of the millenium
You're what you own

So I own not a notion
I escape an ape content
I don't own emotion- I rent

MARK
What was it about that night

ROGER
What was it about that night

BOTH
Connection- In an isolatiing age

MARK
For once the shadows gave way to light

ROGER
For once the shadows gave way to light

BOTH
For once I didn't disengage

[following two sung almost at the same time]

MARK
Angel- I hear you- I hear it
I see it- I see it my film!

Roger 
Mimi-I see you- I hear it- 
I hear it- 
I hear it my song

[following two sung almost at same time]

MARK (On the phone)
Alexi-Mark
Call me a hypocrite
I need to finish my
Own film
I quit!

Roger
One song glory
Mimi your eyes

BOTH
Dying in America
At the end of the millenium
We're dying in America
To come into our own

And when you're dying in America
At the end of the millenium
You're not alone

I'm not alone
I'm not alone---Lyrics submitted by mark.
