She's 5 foot 3, Lord ain't she sweet
She's got everything a man believes he needs
she won't stay, she don't work that way
and the man he is you'd think it be something he could take
CHORUS
But the bigger the heart 
The harder they fall
He can't help it, it ain't his fault
Another man has done been caught
But the bigger the heart
The harder they fall

he's always been rough 
i'm talkin' bar room tough
he always said he'd never fall in love
but now it's too late
 he's in such a bad state
he's on his knees beggin' her every day

repeat chorus twice

The bigger the heart the harder they fall---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
