She sat in her hospital bed
Drawing pictures of the sky
And through all of the pain she felt
She had never asked why

But when the doctor walked in
And said its time for your meds
With tears in her eyes
She looked at the doctor and said...

How big are angel wings
Are they small enough for me
Do they make them little
In the size I might need
They say where I'm goin
I won't feel no more pain
So I really need to know
How big are angel wings

I can't ask momma 
I know it'd make her sad
I don't like to see her cry
And it does the same thing to dad
And at night when I sleep 
I see heaven in my dreams
So please won't you answer 
This question for me...

How big are angel wings
Are they small enough for me
Do they make them little
In the size I might need
They say where I'm goin
I won't feel no more pain
So I really need to know 
How big are angel wings

They say where I'm goin
I won't feel no more pain 
So I really need to know now
How big are angel wings---Lyrics submitted by jennie.
