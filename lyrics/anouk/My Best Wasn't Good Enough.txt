Lets say Im feeling better
Lets say Im feeling fine
Lets say I gave you all I had
And now Im out of time
And my best wasnt good enough

And now this time to wonder
Now this time to heal
Time to let it all come down
But I dont know what I feel

But it aches and it hurts and it burns
Oh it kills me

Tick, tock, you dont stop
You dont fade
You just stay
But Ill do it all again

Now dont you call me baby
Just dont pretend you care
Save your sorry for yourself
When judas takes you there, yes

Once I really believed
There was nothing out there for the lost and lonely
But a voice in my head kept banging on my heart
Says youre not the only one

But it kills me

Tick, tock, you dont stop
You dont fade
You just stay
But Ill do it all again

Tick, tock, you dont stop
You dont fade
You just stay
But Ill do it all again---Lyrics submitted by Neta.
