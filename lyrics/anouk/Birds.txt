Isolated from the outside
Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control
It seems my thoughts wander off
Of the time when I tried to
Live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hope's turned into fear
With my one wing I can't fly
With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that's why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds

To a place without fear, with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
When memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain't lost

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That's why
Birds don't fly---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
