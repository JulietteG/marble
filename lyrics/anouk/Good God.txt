Surely I am willing but I won't 
Claiming that I'll do it but I don't 
Knowing I'll do anything you want 
Pretending I am someone that I'm not 

Good god 
My mind won't let me think right I know your troubled 
Well I'm determined to create this things up in my head that never happened 
In time am I gotta choose 
Freedom or loyalty 
Look at what you have done 
What am I gonna do 

So now that you have made a mess off me 
And show me stars that I have never seen 
I know it's wrong why does it feel so right 
You haven't got me yet but you might 

Your smiling back at me I wanna do it 
I wanna be with you let me get through it 
But am I gonna make it back alive 
Will you show me all the things that you can do 


Good god 
My mind won't let me think right I know your troubled 
Well I'm determined to create this things up in my head that never happened 
In time am I gotta choose 
Freedom or loyalty 
Look at what you have done 
What am I gonna do 

Good god 
My mind won't let me think right I know your troubled 
Well I'm determined to create this things up in my head that never happened 
In time am I gotta choose 
Freedom or loyalty 
Look at what you have done 
What am I gonna do
