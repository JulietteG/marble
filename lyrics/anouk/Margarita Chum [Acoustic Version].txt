Here, if its any consolation, take mine
No, no need for explanations, its alright
With me it would only be redundant, see
If you only try to keep it all inside
I lay me down with your decision
Blow your mind, dont hesitate
This devil takes your pain away
Take mine

But now that I have finally found you
Im gonna take it one step at a time
Lets try keep this good thing going
You tell a joke, I nearly die
We have to laugh until we cry
Take mine, please take mine

My margarita chum, thats what you are
Im laughing my ass off when you sing
Everybodys happy now
The luna-queens become the lunatics
While janis joplin tells her friend
Hes just a one-night stand

I hear you retching in my bathroom, but I dont mind
No, Ill clean it up tomorrow, just sit down
Again you choke me when you grumble
You and me were so much like rg
And now Ill show you how to tango
I think its time for us to say
That this has been a prefect day and retire, please retire

My margarita chum thats what you are
Im laughing my ass of when you sing
Everybodys happy now
A v.i.p is what you are to me
I love it when you take me on your lonely sunday stroll---Lyrics submitted by Lisa.
