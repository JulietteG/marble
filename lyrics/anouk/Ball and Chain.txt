I know the drill you got your ball and chain
Hold you down the circle round the story stays the same
It wont belong and then your hart is frozen
The time has come to break away

You got it all what makes you hesitate
Dont just wait for things to blow up in your pretty face
And if the wait try not to let it slip a way
You may find youre self again

I feel people just dont know you like I do
Why you making it so hard to see 
When theres something wrong
It goes on and on

I know the drill you got your ball and chain
I found out the second round that some things never changes
Opened my eyes and let the days come over me
Maybe it all go away

I feel people just dont know you like I do
Why you making it so hard to see 
When theres something wrong
On and on and on 

Youll see not everybody here to break your hart
So there is a price to pay to be someone youre not

Ohw ohw ohw ohw ohw

On and on and on 
I feel people just dont know you like I do
Why you making it so hard to see 
When theres something wrong

On and on and on 
Youll see not everybody here to break your hart
So there is a price to pay to be someone youre not
To be someone youre not---Lyrics submitted by larissa.
