Haven't we both heard enough babe
This is what we're gonna do
Let me put my arms around you once more
There's nothing left here to prove

Walk away just a little bit slower
Better hold on tight, will we ever learn to let it go
Break Through to the other side
I keep wondering
When were you ever gonna let me know
That you just wanted something else in life

What do you say when it's all over
What do you know when nothing's going right
The troubles in your mind
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do you go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

It was so hard when I watched you falling down
But it was time for you to walk alone
Just know if you really need a friend
And you're feeling like you can't go on

Just walk back just a little bit faster
Take my hand I will blow your fears away
Break through to the other side
For bitter or worse I know you better than anyone else
And I'll be by your side

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

When it all becomes reality
That this is where it ends for you and me
I'm about to lose my mind
Will love find a way on time
Please don't try and kiss these tears away
We know we've both have made mistakes
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all
What do you say nothing at all
What do you say nothing at all---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
