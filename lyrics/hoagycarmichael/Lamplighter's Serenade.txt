A moment after dark around the park,
An old-fashioned gent goes parading.
Dressed in funny clothes, and singing as he goes,
The Lamplighter's Serenade.

The old boy loves to talk with couples on the walk,
Just when it's half-after love-time.
And from his bag of tricks he reaches for his sticks,
And lights every star in the sky.

But if a lady or her beau should answer, "no", 
He sprinkles their hearts with his magic.
Then he steals away to sing another day,
The Lamplighter's Serenade.---Lyrics submitted by Glen.
