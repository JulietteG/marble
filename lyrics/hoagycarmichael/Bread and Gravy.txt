Bread and gravy, lots of bread and gravy
Beans and bacon, lots of beans and bacon
No more frettin' since I've been gettin'
Lots of bread and gravy all the time

Peace and quiet, lots of peace and quiet
Friends and money, lots of friends and money
No more ramblin', I'm through with scramblin'
Keep up with the Joneses all the time

Got no reason to be swell
And my clothes all fit me well
And I wear a nice ring
I'm as free as I can be
And my honey's lovin' me
So I just can't keep from singin'

Bread and gravy, lots of bread and gravy
Goodnight kisses, my love never misses
No more blues now, no bad news now
Just lots of bread and gravy all the time---Lyrics submitted by Claudia.
