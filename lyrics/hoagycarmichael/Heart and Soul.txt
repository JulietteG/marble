Heart and soul
I fell in love with you
Heart and soul
The way a fool would do... madly
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night

Heart and soul
I begged to be adored
Lost control
And tumbled overboard... gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist

Oh! But your lips were thrilling
Much too thrilling
Never before were mine so, strangely willing

But now I see, what one embrace can do
Look at me, it's got me loving you, madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul

[Instrumental]

Oh! But your lips were thrilling
Much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely willing

But now I see, what one embrace can do
Look at me, it's got me loving you, madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul---Lyrics submitted by Kelli Hughes.
