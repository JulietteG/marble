(feat. Unknowns)

I really wanna hear your voice
I really wanna see your face again
Lookin' at your picture now, ya shoulda been my lover (Oh)
Girl you gotta give me a chance,
See I ain't gone treat you like them other men
I'ma make sure that I'll never hurt you

Right now, I'm givin' up, all of the girls that I met in the club (ahh)
Right now, I'ma turn it up, I'ma be the one to make you fall in love...
Right now, I'ma give you what you want, I'ma do the things that the other dudes don't.
Tonight I'm gonna make believe its your birthday! Girl! Oooh...

We ain't gotta ask nobody, (nobody)
We don't even need permission, (permission)
Girl, quit playin' lets do what grown folks do (what grown folks do)
Got all kind of fly suggestions, (suggestions)
