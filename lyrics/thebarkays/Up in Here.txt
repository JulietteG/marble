Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yow, yow, yow, yow, oh)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow)

Everything we do is funky up in here
Everything we do is funky up in here

And we don't want no party poops now, up in here
Yow
We don't want no party poops, now, up in here
Yow

Just give it everything you got, just rock it, don't stop
(Peace out to you to make your body move)
Give it everything you got, just rock it, don't stop
(And you will find yourself right here)

Yeah, they're playin' this song for you to sing
We are funky and we own the beat
It's a hell of a [?] but the funk is free
Up In Here

Just raise your hands high, let us see you shine
Dance [?], shake your behind
We gonna have ourselves one a hell of a time
Up In Here

Go 'head and do your thing, don't be ashamed, up in here
Go 'head and do your thing, don't be ashamed, up in here

We like to see you sing and shout, join the crowd, up in here
Yow
We like to see you sing and shout, join the crowd, up in here
Yow

Just give it everything you got, just rock it, don't stop
(Peace out to you to make your body move)
Give it everything you got, just rock it, don't stop
(And you will find yourself right here)

Yeah, they're playin' this song for you to sing
We are funky and we own the beat
It's a hell of a [?] but the funk is free
Up In Here

Yeah, we just wanna leave you the scoop
We got no time for party poops
You got to be funky [?] to move
Up In Here

No don't hold back, let your feelings show
To move you got the feeling over what you know
We wanna see booty out on the floor

Just raise your hands high, let us see you shine
Dance [?], shake your behind
We gonna have ourselves one a hell of a time
Up In Here

[Bridge]

Up In Here
You got nothing to fear
We like to party down
Up In Here
You got nothing to fear
We spread it all around

Up In Here
You got nothing to fear
We like to party down
Up In Here
You got nothing to fear
We spread it all around

Just give it everything you got, just rock it, don't stop
(Peace out to you to make your body move)
Give it everything you got, just rock it, don't stop
(And you will find yourself right here)

Just give it everything you got, just rock it, don't stop
(Peace out to you to make your body move)
Give it everything you got, just rock it, don't stop
(And you will find yourself right here)---Lyrics submitted by Larry.
