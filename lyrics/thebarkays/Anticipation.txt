I can't hardly wait...

Tonight the need for love, is here between us
And the desire for each other, we cannot hide
Cause anxiously we wait, to feel the passion
That the hunger in our eyes, can't disguise

So girl let's not waste, another moment
Trying to decide, right or wrong
Just come and hold me close, to your body
And let's release the love we've been holding back so long

I'm trying so hard to be patient, but when you're near me I loose control
And there is no time for hesitation, and if you don't give your love to me, I'm going to explode from...

Anticipation,anticipating your every move
Anticipation,anticipating what we're going to do
Don't make me wait... yeah

So girl let's put an end, to all this waiting
And let the power of our desires, tonight unfold
No matter how hard, we try to fight it
When the needle rises baby, it's time to let go

I'm trying so hard to be patient, but when you're near me I loose control
And there is no time for hesitation, and if you don't give your love to me, I'm going to explode from...

Anticipation,anticipating your every move
Anticipation,anticipating what we're gonna do

ooooh....yeah

every breathe you take...---Lyrics submitted by Brenda Robinson.
