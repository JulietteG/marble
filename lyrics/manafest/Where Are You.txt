verse 1
I'm staring at your picture dad
pulling up the past
trying to learn about this father that i never had
so young, so wrong , and ye gone
it's only me, mom, Virginia & God
we're all alone , and our leader is not home
the crossroads took you or those demons below i;m feelin` the cold, you were not here not there
when i had my first fight i was so scared
when i had my first kiss i could not share
i was lost at the school they did not care
why'd you leave me, hangin' from the ceiling angels stopped singi' and mom's not sleepin'
i'm not bitter or mad , i'm just missin' a dad
sittin' here thinkin', prayin' wishin' you back
these fellings are wack , almost too much to bare
i know your soul's alive i just wanna know where


chorus

are you 
  why did you leave me
where are you
  were you thinkin' of me dad
are you
  do you love me
where are you
   then where are you if you do (x2)


verse 2
well i'm all grown up now moved out of p-town
married this girl , mom said you'd be so proud
i even slimmed down hanggin' with a new croud
if only you're around you'd see what i can do now
i travel the globe , singin' bringin' a new hope through hip-hop rockin' roll liftin' the soul
they say i look like you , your smile and eyes too
i got mom's hair thank God i was frightful
i know you cant come back from the past
but the fact that you left and the damge is bad
i don't know if mom fears or if she ever got healed
or if she blames you and God over the years
you were my dad and i was your son 
if only you knew what it was like growin' up
when i look up at the sky
i get this thought in my mindand wonder what it 
would be like if you were still alive(back to chorus )


verse 3
i'm still tryin' to figure out what went on in the house
what voice was so loud what made you kill yourself?
was it something i said,i did as a little kid
somethin' like a fib that you can't forgive
my life is so hard 
lost my only body guard
slowly God healed the scars
let's say you left a mark
i've had the same thoughts that you have ,talked to you talked to me
i had to see a shrink but know im'm back on my feet
i battle through words , using psalms and verbs
a new rebirth no longer am i insecure
i heard a voice say that i'll never leave ye
but i didn't see ya i've forgotten ye like amnesia
i believe i'll see you somewhere in heaven
where we can talk and i can ask you a question
but for now, i'm a move on , be strong
and make sure i'm here for my own son(back to chorus)---Lyrics submitted by dymond.
