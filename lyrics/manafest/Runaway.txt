Its funny I never thought that Id be homeless 
I used to walk by them, now Im living on the corners 
Stretching for a touch of a hand, a dollar bill or a chance 
Give me your sandwich bag, man Ill do anything 
With thoughts of desperation my hearts racing 
Im not star gazing I could die of starvation 
Hallucinated from the days wasted 
Lost track of time while my mind aging 
People looking at me like a lost patient 
Like Im already dead why they all hating 
Did I choose this life, or life choose me 
I ran away at sweet 16 mommy do you miss me, this is Krissy 

So I run, and I run, and I ran and I ran praying maybe some day we meet again 
Cause It hurts when you hurt, and I hurt and I feel, like Im healed can we all just make a mends 
I run and I run and I run, and I run 

Good bye to the world, good bye to my girl 
Say hello to my home the street corner 
Its absurd every word that was spoken 
It must come alive cause my life is still broken 
Wondering did I miss it, what mistake did I make? Can I fix it? 
These streets of gone ballistic 
This isnt what I thought it would be, wheres daddy 
Is he still mad at me, I wonder would he have me 
Back in the home, back in the zone, back where I cant eat 
Wheres theres heat and use a phone 
Cause it hurts and I know I never said good bye 
I ran away I thought like anything I could fly 

Mom and dad are you there, are you listening 
I want to come home, but scared of the mess Im in 
Please forgive me of the things I committed 
Against you against me, our family tree 
And I know we havent spoke in so long, I was so wrong 
To think I could live on, on my own accord 
Im a take the train home, but I need to know 
If youll welcome me back through your lifes door? 
Show me a sign with a red ribbon, hang one on the side of the train building 
And if I see it than Ill know that your still willing, 
And if not I wont ever call or visit 
Ill pretend that Im re-living the beginning, 
Like when we used talk in the kitchen, without all the fights & friction 
This is me wishing, one of your ex children 
Picturing praying that you got the same feelings, 
Im running---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
