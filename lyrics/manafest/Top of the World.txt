To be on the top of the world
To be on the top of the world

The stores are open people buying, people trying climbing
To get to the top of the world, 
In this modern day war and its simple Simon
Im paying my bills 
Shes taking some pills 
Hes drunk and behind the wheel
Actors acting, rappers rapping 
Trapped in a drug of a deal
Homeless are looking for meals 
The thief is still looking to steal
You chasing the money
Chasing you're praying for marriage, romancing your honey
Im searching but where does it end, 
Im leaning on calling on a friend
Im running, and running, for someone, 
To lend me a hand or to help me ascend

To be on top of the world
Gotcha, gotcha ye girl
Its whatcha you wanted whatcha you want
Its what youre living for

To be on top of the world
Gotcha, gotcha ye girl
Its whatcha you wanted whatcha you want
Its what youre living for

Hey, Hey, gotta believe in something
Hey, Hey, you gotta climb to the top of the world,
Hey, gotta believe in something
Show you the way, every day is a mission to be
On top of the world

Its 9oclock right on the dot 
And youll be here to 5
Armies are marching on the fields 
We pray they all survive
Peace on earth to all men, 
The stars they shine from heaven 
Its whatcha you want, its what you want, 
Its what were living for
A boy and girl they hold hands, 
I hope it lasts forever 
Its never enough to find one that you love
And not just seeking for self to pleasure
What is this mountain you climb? 
Is it for peace or for pride?
The prize, the goals, 
the thoughts inside our motives come alive

To be on top of the world
Gotcha, gotcha ye girl
Its whatcha you wanted whatcha you want
Its what youre living for

To be on top of the world
Gotcha, gotcha ye girl
Its whatcha you wanted whatcha you want
Its what youre living for

Hey, Hey, gotta believe in something
Hey, Hey, you gotta climb to the top of the world,
Hey, gotta believe in something
Show you the way, every day is a mission to be
On top of the world

Left, right, left, right, step into the lime light
Get into your car drive, everything is alright
Its alright, alright, everything is alright
Live like its your last night, (LIVE LIKE ITS YOUR LAST NIGHT)
I wanna live forever, 
While storing up some treasures
I wanna go to heaven 
And never be abandoned 
Im spending my time now renewing my mind 
To the truth I climb so high
I find and apply to my life the joy I will lift up my eyes

To be on top of the world
Gotcha, gotcha ye girl
Its whatcha you wanted whatcha you want
Its what youre living for

To be on top of the world
Gotcha, gotcha ye girl
Its whatcha you wanted whatcha you want
Its what youre living for

Hey, Hey, to be on top of the world
Hey, Hey, 
To be on top of the world

On top of the world---
