Hey, I never said I was an angel, no
I never said I wouldnt break down, yeah
Beside myself, living in a cold cell
Dont shut me out

Yeah, you look at me like Im a stranger
Yeah, you make me feel like I betrayed you
Dont leave me stranded,
As I reach out my hand

'Cause I wear my heart on my sleeve
If you cut me Ill bleed
I know I cannot erase
Every mistake that Ive made

I never said I was an angel, no
I never said I wouldnt break down
But life keeps on moving
By now you should know

Im only human
Hey, hey, hey
Im only human
Hey, hey, hey

Hey, got any grace for a failure?
'Cause Im feeling like I failed you
Yeah, I lashed out, digging up my past
O, I know let you down, yeah
O, Im still fighting for the future
Yeah, 'cause I never wanna lose you

Ill keep on climbing
If youre on my side

'Cause I wear my heart on my sleeve
If you cut me Ill bleed
I know I cannot erase
Every mistake that Ive made

I never said I was an angel, no
I never said I wouldnt break down
But life keeps on moving
By now you should know

Im only human
Hey, hey, hey
Im only human
Hey, hey, hey

I know Im breaking your heart
Every storm that tears us apart
I know Im to blame for all the damage
Ive done

But you know that Im ready to take the fall

I never said I was angel
I never said I wouldnt break down

'Cause I wear my heart on my sleeve
If you cut me Ill bleed
I know I cannot erase
Every mistake that Ive made

I never said I was an angel, no
I never said I wouldnt break down
But life keeps on moving
By now you should know

Im only human
Hey, hey, hey
Im only human
Hey, hey, hey

Im only human
Hey, hey, hey
Im only human ---Lyrics submitted by Madison Ditterline.
