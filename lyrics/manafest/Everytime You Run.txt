Last night got a little crazy
I dont remember, woke up spun with the pasties 
My friends say I was tweaked out, 
Passed out on a dirty coach, still in the house
It kind a scares me, I dont know
Am out of control, always waking up still in my clothes
I wrote a note that said goodbye to pain, good bye to shame
But couldnt find a way, I just cry for days
Im so depressed, soak in wet, I cant rest
These thoughts just beat me to death Im un-kept 
I thought of a song my mom used to sing in church
But its been so long I cant remember the words

Every time you run, every time you hide
Every time it hurts, every time you cry
Every time you run away, every time you hide your face
And it feels so far away, Im right here, with you

Every time you run

I keep sleeping in dont want to wake up
I keep hearing from the landlord pay up
Hide my face in my pillow till the sunsets
Hung over and I havent seen a pay check 
I took a job down town at the factory
I was hired and fired with no salary 
I keep running from responsibility 
Its seems impossible, the pressure is hitting me
I know I need to man up, or sit down
Stand up and get out of this crowd
I thought of a song my mom used to sing in church
But its been so long I cant remember the words

Every time you run, every time you hide
Every time it hurts, every time you cry
Every time you run away, every time you hide your face
And it feels so far away, Im right here, with you

Well I know Im not ready to die, But Ive
Sure thought about the meaning of life
Cause I cant seem to find a purpose for me
Its just the choices and I fail to proceed
I got a get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
I hear voices in my mind, ones a devil, ones Jesus
I can feel it can you help me find the pieces
Like an angel on my shoulder, you hold the
Joy of the lord raising up a soldier 
You gave me the song my mom used to sing in church
I promised not to quit and I remembered the words
I promised not to quit and I remembered the words

Every time you run, every time you hide
Every time it hurts, every time you cry
Every time you run away, every time you hide your face
And it feels so far away, Im right here, with you---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
