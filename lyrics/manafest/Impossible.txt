Crying and hiding this feeling 
Running and fighting for freedom 

This is the last time, Ill cry lullabies 
All night cant sleep I hear the floors creek 
I feel shadows in my room 
My friends find another bruise 
I might end up on the news 
I just dont know what to do 
God Im calling you 
Send an angel send two 
I wanna move but Im trapped in the outer room 
I know you hear me clearly Im weary 
Come and fill me with your power heal me 

It seems impossible for me to let this go 
Feel like an animal, Im ready to lose control 
Take everything you need, take every part of me 
Give me some room to breathe before I lose control

I got to get away 
Gotta break away 
(Save Me)
Got to find a way 
Got to break the chains 
(Take me) 
Before I lose control 
Before I lose control 
It seems impossible 
Its not impossible 

Im tired so tired of walking through this fire 
If you want to find me Ill be here in my room 
Im thinking you're drinking, 
To get out before you start swinging 
Wish I could show you all the pain inside me 

It seems impossible for me to let this go 
Feel like an animal, Im ready to lose control 
Take everything you need, take every part of me 
Give me some room to breathe before I lose control

I got to get away 
Gotta break away 
(Save Me)
Got to find a way 
Got to break the chains 
(Take me) 
Before I lose control 
Before I lose control 
It seems impossible 
Its not impossible 

It seems impossible 
Crying and hiding this feeling 
Running and fighting for freedom 
For me to lose control 
Crying and hiding this feeling 
Running and fighting for freedom 

It seems impossible for me to let this go
Feel like an animal.........

It seems impossible for me to let this go 
Feel like an animal, Im ready to lose control 
Take everything you need, take every part of me 
Give me some room to breathe before I lose control

It seems impossible for me to let this go
Feel like an animal
It seems impossible
It's not impossible
It seems impossible to lose control
It seems impossible
It's not impossible---Lyrics submitted by Isaiah.
