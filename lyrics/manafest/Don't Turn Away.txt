I never talk the talk unless I walk the walk
In the dark what you want come get it
I see you fake and flaunt, the way you pose and stomp
I got soul and I know where you're headed 
So if you want what I got come get it
And if not than go and just forget it
Cause in the light I can see you faking, over rated

Lets face it close the case gangsta's 
Bass to your face, with faith based answers
I got anthems, ain't talking hansom
Bloods on your hands you wash and just abandon
I wanna talk to ye, put god in ye
In a non threatened way, it's calling ye
Start walking yo, what's stalling ye
You've fallen "Get UP!"

So I'll be the first to introduct you
To the one that's trapped inside of you
Don't turn away, 
Away from yourself
Everytime you buy into 
All the lies of the life they're feeding you
Don't play their game, it's not the way, don't turn away from yourself

I never talk the talk unless I walk the walk
In the dark what you want come get it
I see you fake and flaunt the way you pose and stomp
I got soul and I know where you're headed
So if you want what I want come get it
And if not than just go and just forget it
Cause in the light I can see you faking, over rated

I'm not the type to write just to go fight ya'll
I'm holding mic's to light the fire up in us
Taking flight to heights it's so ridiculous
I see lies coming out your mouth & such
Ya'll selling it ya'll dont believe in it
Ya'll keep yelling it we start repeating it
Brainwashing us you fake and pose cool
I see right through you right through

So I'll be the first to introduct you
To the one thats trapped inside of you
Don't turn away,
Away from yourself
Everytime you buy into
All the lie of the life they're feeding you
Don't play their game, It's not the way, Don't turn away from youself

Don't turn away
You got to listen
Don't play the game
It's all in act and
It's not the way
Come on be real, 
Following ye hearts is the only way you'll get it

Don't turn away
You got to listen
Don't play the game
It's all in act and
It's not the way
Not the way
I think the man has got something to say

They try to take me yawning
I hear that alarming
Got to get ahead of the game they just keep calling in
I hear them following, yo they just bothering
Me from walking in my dreams all hollering
I make a choice and I live it, I give it
All to the cause even if we all fall
I seen whats really real
They lie, cheat, and steal
I speak life watch my city heal

So I'll be the first to introduce you
To the one that's trapped inside of you
Don't turn away
Away from yourself
Everytime you buy into
All the lies of the life their feeding you
Don't play their game, it's not the way, don't turn away from yourself

Don't turn away from yourself
Don't turn away
Don't play the game
It's not the way---Lyrics submitted by Chelsey.
