I drop in with my face to the wind
Spin 180 for the win
But I cant find my feet its like I lost the beat
Mid air and theres no plan Bs
Hit the streets, 

Look before I leap again,
Skeleton filled with Adrenalin
How can I know that I got what it takes?
When Ive come so far, through the rain 
Bear the pain

Makes no difference now 
Face myself or get taken out
One more time got to live this loud
Back to the wall no turning around)

Its too late Its my fate
I cant turn around 
Theres no fear, in the mirror
To hold me down
Im too far, from the start
Now Im in too deep 

Ive got to stick to the plan
Cause theres no Plan B

No turning back (No plan B)
Theres no other path, (No plan B)

And I know that this road is my destiny 
Ive got to stick to the plan
Cause theres no plan B

Get a shot, for the top on my soap box
Pop a zit go sing let my tunes talk
Cool kid, and Im in the mood
Give me combo number 2 
Whats up wich you?

Dude you look scared to me, better take a chair
Before you fail to see, A to Z like 3 times 3
Its the basics, homie embrace it
Come on!!

Take the shot dont waste the clock
March to the drum of the #1 spot
Born for this, victorious 
Storms break off so glorious

Its too late Its my fate
I cant turn around 
Theres no fear, in the mirror
To hold me down
Im too far, from the start
Now Im in too deep 

Ive got to stick to the plan
Cause theres no Plan B

No turning back (No plan B)
Theres no other path, (No plan B)

And I know that this road is my destiny 
Ive got to stick to the plan
Cause theres no plan B

All I know is I cant turn back, all I know is I cant turn back
Got to leave it in the past, got to leave it in the past.
All I know is I cant turn back, all I know is I cant turn back
Got to leave it in the past, got to leave it in the past.

Cause this is the only road Ive ever known, 
theres no way that I could start again, Again

Its too late Its my fate
I cant turn around 
Theres no fear, in the mirror
To hold me down
Im too far, from the start
Now Im in too deep 

Ive got to stick to the plan
Cause theres no Plan B

No turning back (No plan B)
Theres no other path, (No plan B)

And I know that this road is my destiny 
Ive got to stick to the plan
Cause theres no plan B---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
