I cant stop the chase. I cant stop the chase


Always feel like Im on the run
Feel guilty when Im having fun
Only work seems to turn me on
Burning out, and Ive just begun
Brain wont stop, chase the clock
Race to the top take it all
Girl I know, I need to come home
In my world surrounded alone
If I could you know I would
Knock on wood I know I should
Slow it down, one more round
See this crowd let me rock them out


Im in the middle of the race
Cant stop the chase
Theyre pulling away

I got to be on top
My dreams on lock
They wont let go of me

I cant stop the chase
Its too late cant turn it off, till I reach the top wont ever stop
Til you know my name
Got to keep the pace, cause your never gonna stop the chase

I cant stop the chase, I cant stop the chase


Still going Yup,
Havent talked to myself in awhile
Touring round, round, mashed out
Dont want let me down
Now(hah) spitted, with uh, kicked with ah
Freestyle, can anybody huh, freak me out
When Im on stage I get so wild
Cause I got great faith, stepping in late, I stayed straight
I got it made its just my destiny---- UH


Im in the middle of the race
Cant stop the chase
Theyre pulling away

I got to be on top
My dreams on lock
They wont let go of me

I cant stop the chase
Its too late cant turn it off, till I reach the top wont ever stop
Until you know my name
Got to keep the pace cause your never gonna stop the chase


I woke up in a sweat again
Choked up from the medicine
Cant sleep keep wrestling
Success is so dangerous
If I chill cant pay the bills
If Im ill cant spit the real
Some would kill for the life I live
Some will build sacrifice and win
Chased them all faced them all
Paced the hallway walls and brawled
Just no way I can turn it off; but
Some how always turn back to God

Im in the middle of the race
Cant stop the chase
Theyre pulling away

I got to be on top
My dreams on lock
They wont let go of me

I cant stop the chase
Its too late cant turn it off, till I reach the top wont ever stop
Til you know my name
Got to keep the pace, cause your never gonna stop the chase---Lyrics submitted by forrest.
