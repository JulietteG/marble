We got it, we got it, we got it going on, and yo we got it, we got it, now march to the drums, YO

We got it going on, 300 million strong
Stop the bombs, love riot in the streets, cuz
Smile for the camera, you're in America
No terrors tearing us, we wont surrender up
Benevolent and you know, evidence and we sow
Jump out the boat, go, go
Were singing were swinging were turning it up
So let me see all your hands, wah oh, wah oh
I give a shout for the ladies, men still standing
Grant me a wish, and Ill be dancing, prancing, love romancing
We got it going on in your America, my America, oh America

Hey(hey), Ho(ho),
Now were gonna rock 
untill the lights go out (out),
Theres fire in the kitchen again
Hey(hey), Ho(ho),
Now were gonna rock 
untill the wheels fall off,
Oh-oh-oh..we got it goin on

We got it, we got it, we got it going on, and yo we got it, we got it, now march to the drums, YO
Im not the only one, whos ever held a gun
Id rather shoot some love, Superman go save someone
They had me on the run, now Im on the hunt
I got have some fun, before my time is done
Lets start a riot, a riot, love in the streets
Im so wired on fire no reason to sleep
I cant deny it Im flying, higher then trees
So lets spark up the jam, woe, oh woe oh
I give a shout to the ladies, men still standing
Grant me a wish, Ill be dancing, prancing, love romancing
We got it going on in your America, my America, oh America

Hey(hey), Ho(ho),
Now were gonna rock
untill the lights go out (out),
Theres fire in the kitchen again
Hey(hey), Ho(ho),
Now were gonna rock
untill the wheels fall off,
Oh-oh-oh..we got it goin on

Hey(hey), Ho(ho),
Now were gonna rock
untill the lights go out (out),
Theres fire in the kitchen again
Hey(hey), Ho(ho),
Now were gonna rock
untill the wheels fall off,
Oh-oh-oh..we got it goin on---Lyrics submitted by Kelsey.
