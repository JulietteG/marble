Eh eh eh edge of my life
Eh eh eh edge of my life
Eh eh eh edge of my life
My life

Last dollar just got spent
First of the month comes
Got to pay rent

Where'd the money go
Slipping through my hands
I'm working with these hands

Little Johnny needs a lunch box
Little Susy needs clothes & it won't stop
Banks calling us up
And they don't care
It's more then i can bare

I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine

I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine

I!!!
I'm at the edge of my life
I got no time to think twice
When I'm standing with the weight
Of the world on my shoulders

I!!!
I'm gonna fight the good fight
Cause I, I know I'll get by
When I battle every day through the pain
Like a soldier

Eh eh eh edge of my life
Eh eh eh edge of my life
Eh eh eh edge of my life
My life

Mom crying on the sofa
Dad comes home but he's not sober
Where'd the family go
Up in smoke again
Feels just like sinking sand

Heard shouts in the backyard (hey)
Sirens ringing from a cop car
It's a rough day
For this family man
I'm praying with these hands

I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine

I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine

I!!!
I'm at the edge of my life
I got no time to think twice
When I'm standing with the weight
Of the world on my shoulders

I!!!
I'm gonna fight the good fight
Cause I, I know I'll get by
When I battle every day through the pain
Like a soldier

Eh eh eh edge of my life
Eh eh eh edge of my life
Eh eh eh edge of my life

Just don't look down
And you'll never fall

I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve
We're gonna make this one shine

I gotta, gotta believe
I can more then survive
Still one trick up my sleeve---
