it's a boring day i'v got nothing to do-except get a load of retards and drive 'em to to the zoo

[2x] oh oh oh takin retards to the zoo

load 'em on a bus just for laughs 
down a winding road stepping on the gas
down a winding road just daydreaming 
down a winding road with the retards screaning

[2x] oh oh oh takin retards to the zoo

one of 'ems blowing a big spit bubble 
slam on the breaks at the first shinn of trouble
head on colision bodies everywhere
head on colision retards bewhere 

[2x] oh oh oh takin retards to the zoo---Lyrics submitted by christopher.
