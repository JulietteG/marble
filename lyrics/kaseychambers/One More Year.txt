He was walking across the wire holding a loaded gun
Taking out every light bulb one by one
And she was building brand new walls to keep her safe and sound
Sometimes a place to live is just a place to hide

One more year, one more year
Let's hold our breath and give it just one more year

We were sparks and gasoline, all fire and command
The warmest comfort dies in the coldest hands
And she was two steps from the edge but holding on somehow
Even God himself couldn't blame her now

One more year, one more year
Let's hold our breath and give it just one more year

Now he's working on a plan, learning to make her smile
Maybe a change of pace or a change of style
When she's walking across the wire holding a loaded gun
Hoping that what we feel ain't what we've become

One more year, one more year
Let's hold our breath and give it just one more year

One more year, one more year
Let's hold our breath and give it just one more year---Lyrics submitted by cheyenne.
