She always turns up bright and early, And she always gets there, way to late,
She likes funny movies, even if there bad,
And she likes all the ones that make you sad,
She likes the singer from the Beatles, 
And she likes the one who plays he drums,
She like her house clean, take your shoes of at the door, 
And she throws all her things on the floor,
But if it all comes down, at the end of time,
Ill keep your secrets, if you keep mine,
And if we lost it all, we would not care,
Cause if friend ships money, we be millionaires.
She always crys at newborn babies,
And she thinks they all look like old men,
She thinks Im old fashioned, she always tells me so,
And she thinks that I wear my top to low.
But if it all comes down, at the end of time,
Ill keep your secrets, if you keep mine,
And if we lost it all, we would not care,
Cause if friend ships money, we be millionaires.---Lyrics submitted by Elly.
