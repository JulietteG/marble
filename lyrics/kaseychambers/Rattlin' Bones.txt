Smoked on rice, fuel don't burn.
Sun don't shine no more.
Later one night, sorrow come round,
Scratching at my door.
But i cut my hands and break my back, 
Dragging this bag of stones.
Till i bury me down, beneath the ground,
With dust and rattling bones.

I left my home, i left my love, 
Caught on a rusty nail.
Devil rose up, heavy with gold.
My souls not for sale.

Then a holy man in a house of god.
Offered me a book of prayers.
Then i left my home, i left my love. 
I left my faith back there.

Smoked on rice, fuel don't burn.
Sun don't shine no more.
Later one night, sorrow come round 
Scratching at my door.
But i cut my hand and break my back,
Dragging this bag of stones.
Till i bury me down beneath the ground,
With the dust and rattling bones

Shut my eyes and hang my head.
darkness makes no sound.
Climbing up a bottle neck,
Earth on the way back down.
And when a sadness falls on morning bird,
Wonder what the day will bring?
Then i shut my eyes and hang my head 
At least that bird can sing

Smoked on rice, fuel don't burn. 
Sun don't shine no more.
Later one night, sorrow came round,
Scratching at my door
But i cut my hands and break my back,
Dragging this bag of stones
Till i bury me down, beneath the ground,
With the dust and rattling bones.
Till i bury me down, beneath the ground,
With the dust and rattling bones.---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
