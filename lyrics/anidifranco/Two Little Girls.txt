You were fresh off the boat from Virginia 
I had a year in New York city under my belt
We met in dream we were both nineteen 
I remember how we were standing 
I remember how it felt
Two little girls growing out of their training bras
This little girl breaks furniture 
This little girl breaks laws
To girls together
Just a little less alone
This little girl cried wee wee wee all the way home
You were always half crazy 
Now look at you baby
You make about as much sense as a nursery rhyme
Love is a piano dropped from a fourth story window
You were in the wrong place
At the wrong time
And you know I don't like your girlfriend
You know I blame her 
Never seen one of your lovers do you so much harm
I loved you first 
And you know I would prefer
If she didn't empty her syringes 
Into you arm
Here comes little naked me padding up to the bathroom door
To find little naked you slumped on the bathroom floor
So I guess I'll just stand here with my back against the wall
While you distill your whole life down to 911 call
And now you bring me your bruises 
So I can ooh and aah at the display
Maybe I'm supposed to make one of my famous jokes
That makes everything ok
Or maybe I'm supposed to be the handsome prince
Who rides up and unties your hands
Maybe I'm supposed to be the furrowed-brow friend
Who thinks she understands
Here comes little naked me padding up to the bathroom door
To find little naked you slumped on the bathroom floor
So I guess I'll just stand here with my back against the wall
While you distill your whole life down to a 911 call---Lyrics submitted by kristina.
