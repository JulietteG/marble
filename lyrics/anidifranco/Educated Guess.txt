Looks like my crazy family 
Is down one crazy daughter 'cause
I'm shipwrecked in a desert that 
Once was underwater just 
Looking for a swift turn of phrase
Some colors to fly 
As I float by
In the parade

Plus I dream in skips and in sentences 
Of a stronger faster fiercer you
And to each noun, verb and predicate
I dedicate a vivid hue
But you and done to well
Getting past your permanent pastel
Have you now?
Yes the desert seems so promising 
And then it paled somehow

So school is in session
Get your chin off your desk
Now pick up your pencil 
And turn over your test
Use your education 
And take an educated guess
About me

I've got a slot at eye level
Like a speakeasy door
And I know you know the password
Cause I've seen you here before
And I've got something free
For you and I don't care if it is more
Than you deserve
I've got a lot of nerve a lot of nerve
Now watch me while I take this curve

So school is in session
Get your chin off your desk
Now pick up your pencil 
And turn over your test
Use your education 
And take an educated guess
About me
About me

Plus I have this whole new family 
And I'm in love with each of them
I'm on this list called lucky
Whenever I'm in reach of them
And I'm learning how to say 
That I'd be happy either way
With your love

So school is in session
Get your chin off your desk
Now pick up your pencil 
And turn over your test
Use your education 
And take an educated guess
About me
About me---Lyrics submitted by kristina.
