You really gave me hell, big talker
Polluted the well
You really spoke your mind, big talker
At least your mind at the time
Now I'm wearing your words, big talker
Like necklaces and rings
Just glad it wasn't me, big talker
That said all those things

Never before could I picture
Even one foot out the door
Careless words, careless words
Say no more
But now that that door has been opened
It can never be closed
Careless words, careless words
I can never unknow
I can never unknow

Tried to keep my heart pure, big talker
But it came out stained
Tried to stay in love, big talker
But instead I'm in pain
I learned as a child, big talker
Just shut the whole thing down
That polluted well, big talker
That whole polluted town

And never before could I picture
Even one foot out the door
Careless words, careless words
Say no more
But now that that door has been opened
It can never be closed
Careless words, careless words
I can never unknow
I can never unknow

No sleep for me, big talker
Just one long migraine
One that sparks and flares, big talker
When I say your name
Where went your love? big talker
Cuz that's where I go
I'm no longer here, big talker
I'm searching high and low

And never before could I picture
Even one foot out the door
Careless words, careless words
Say no more
But now that that door has been opened
It can never be closed
Careless words, careless words
I can never unknow
You can never unknow ---
