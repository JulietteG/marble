Backyard, little boy  
Big yella Tonka toy  
Turtle pool full of dirt  
Grab the hose give er a squirt ya got  
Mud, mud  

Snack time back door  
Foot prints white floor  
Poor momma, big fit  
But i was standin there happy as a pig in  

Mud all over my clothes  
Mud, comin out my nose  
Mud, oozin up through my toes  
Mud well I always end up in the  
Mud lord I can't get enough of that  
Mud my first love  
Mud, mud  

16 first truck  
Stripped down jacked up  
Spring rain pure bliss  
Last words, watch this, hit it  

Mud clean up to the door  
Mud stuck 4x4  
Mud can't move no more  
Mud well I always end up in the  
Mud lord I can't get enough of that  
Mud my first love  

Just when I thought life couldn't get no gooder  
Out of the woods come a real good looker  
Mooshine fine, sweeter than sugar  
Sittin in her jeep, lookin at me  
Girl of my dreams buried rim deep in  
Mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud mud  

A little m.u.d., spells you and me  
Gettin way down deep  
A little good clean fun, c'mon and get ya some  
Ya everyone say  
"mud" "what" "mud"  

Mud all over your clothes  
Mud on your pretty little nose  
Mud ah between your toes  
Mud ya I always end up in the  
Mud ya that's the good stuff  
Mud well my first love  

Mud, mud---
