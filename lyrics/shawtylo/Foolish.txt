[Chorus:]
I come thru in some real foolish
And they like boy you a fool
And he like boy you a fool
And she like boy you a fool
[x2]

[Verse 1:]
I come thru in some real coupish
Transparent see right thru it
And oh yea and this that new shit
And L.O and bitch I do this
Shawty L.O I'm ten toes down
I'm up the sideline tryin' to stay in bounds
I just sold a hundnun and it just touch down
Call them aliens time to re-up now
Yea yea love my d-boy style
All the dope boys got the girls goin' wild
Yea I'm like na na na
I'm laughin' at you niggas like ha ha ha
Let's go

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
They know I'm Lo
I'm C.E.O

You ready let's go
Yea yea come fly with me
I hear em whisperin' how fly he be
Seventy thousand dollars on the clean white tee
Look at Shawty Lo he so icey
Is he worth a mill, well bitch I might be
I hear them fantasizing but they want to be me
Yea yea I don said it befo'
I'm a real d-boy you can't be me folk
Yea I'm like na na na
I'm laughing at you niggas like ha ha ha
Let's go

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
I'm gettin money

Say he want what nawl he don't really want it
You don't want that drama
Listen boy I promise
I stay with them goons and you don't want no problems
The base still jumpin
Yea we doin numbers
Early in tha morning in the kitchen like my mama
Niggas on these corners
With them thangs on em
Twelve ride by boy it's hotta than daytona
Who wanna
Nigga come and test me
I be in tha bankhead you can neva miss me(niggas)
That rappin don't impress me
D.4.L records Shawty Lo you niggas history
