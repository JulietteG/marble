It's a comfort
When I think of ???
It's a warm glow
In the heart of me
We were starting
To come alive

Oh when the nights were warm
And the fields rolled on
When the days were long
When we were young

In the summer days
When the lawn grew tall
We had secrets
And we shared them all
We were starting
To come alive

Oh when the nights were warm
And the fields rolled on
When the days were long
When we were young

When the ??? played on
When we were found our song
When the days were long
When we were young---Lyrics submitted by Maggie Fox.
