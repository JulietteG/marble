Our Days Performed by Leslie Mills

Whats underneath the warmest water
Whats in your dreams thats like no other
Are you alone
Are you alright now

Let your secrets out
Let me just find out

Look into my eyes
Leave it all behind

Lets get in the deep
Look into my eyes
Lets get in the deep
Leave the rest behind
Lets get in the deep
And see what we can find---Lyrics submitted by Jami.
