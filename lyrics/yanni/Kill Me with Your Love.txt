Kill Me With Your Love Performed by Chloe

Tell me who you are today
Did you leave the best with the words you wont say
Different man, different heart
Now we stand worlds and worlds apart

Underneath the ruins that lie
A broken rhythm keeps running through my mind
The color red is all I see
Blinded by the remains of you and me

I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all
I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all

My obsession lies in this room
Vacant memories haunt me through and through
Descending from this high
Silence fills the void where the fire died

I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all
I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all

I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all
I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all---Lyrics submitted by Jami.
