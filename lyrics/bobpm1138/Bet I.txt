[Chorus]
Put me on anything still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please dont gas me up
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I,(bust)
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust

[B.o.B]
Bust, bust, bu-bu-bust
Yeah, on bud, bet I bust
Thats just what I does, yes
Put me anywhere on the map with a backpack strapped
Still I bet I bust
Bet I flow
Bet I rip this beat
Bet I feel that soul
Bet I go
Bet I bench these n-ggas like Ray, sit down bro!
Bet I know, everything about this game
Bet I know my role
Plus they know when I come to the court this is my sport
B dot o, B
So, bet I go
Bet Im on a brand new plane
Bet Im in a whole different zone
I aint really from this place
So i'm up all night long 
Really Im in outterspace
Really I aint got no home
Really Im a saint
Bet Im blown,
Bet Im thrown, up to the sky
Over the ocean
So I fly wherever Im goin
When Im by, bet Im focused
If its five, you can bet I roll it
Matter of fact, you can bet I bust



[T.I]
Drive a brown parkin center
The king from the emma
The room with the boom in the booth, I deliver
The hottest, you prolly too small to acknowledge you
Impossible to copy like what everybody try to do
We cool as some dudes on them waves out in Malibu
Im ballin hard baseline, fall through the alley-oop
BAM!
Comin through this thang like James in the air off the bare of my hand
N-gga jus cant. pretend you forgot my name if you wanna
Ima come hard like a boner
Dont I
Make a n-gga wanna rebound, turnt up, all the way, hey we out
2 or 3 tramp
Put em in the ? bentley
N-gga say he do it like us, he should mean 96, 97
? have more blocks than ?
For those who cant hold water need a new kidney
Put it down under Australia, Sidney (bye)
And Im still representing,
For the n-ggas under prison
You are tuned in, listenin
And Im back to doing big things
A sucka lookin for me, start in yo bitch(s) dreams
Thats why Im 20 feet tall standing on the big screen
Get dough, get green, my flow sickening,
Its the King n-gga!

[Chorus - B.o.B]
Put me on anything still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please dont gas me up
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I,(bust)
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust


[Playboy Tre]
Yeah, back with a cup of that liquor, n-gga
yall dont really know Tre,
Really know me,
Really know the streets, no!
Yall n-ggas really aint G,
Really aint hard,
Never really served no heart,
Yall be playin that roll
Talkin that pimp sh-t,
Never really pimp sh-t, nah
Yall be singin them hoes
But I dont, and I wont
Ill get a bitch anytime I want
Im that guy, spit that fire
Shake the ground everytime I stomp
Bit? in the trunk, cup in the air
You can talk sh-t but I really dont care
Man Im in the cadillac goin direct
Gonna clack that back? cuz a n-gga aint scared
Im that red clay, East of the A?
Ya n-ggas get locked up everyday
Cops aint sh-t so I drop that sh-t
(?) make it through the day
Grindin for my pay
Its that n-gga Tre
Bustin like a pistol best believe it when I say
That I bust!

[Chorus - B.o.B]
Put me on anything still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please dont gas me up
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I,(bust)
I bet I bust
I bet I bust (I, I)
Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust
