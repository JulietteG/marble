I'll be in the sky
I'll be there
Ooh all right
(x2)

I'll be in the sky

yea yea yea
yea yea yea
yea
I'll be in the sky
(x2)



Remember when i leave,
That the one in the mirror aint me,
Its just someone that i call B.O.B,
Its kinda me but its not,
Its just a mask that i got,
So that i can rap and get off my block,
Reminiscin my past when i was a todler,
Sittin in grass and playin with blocks,
Failing my classes now im on lockdown,
Now writin and readin alot,
Money and weed is in my shoe box now,
While im tryina get me a glock,
Cause i thought i was at the end of my line,
Then i find out it was all in my mind,
Thats why im here to end all the fear,
We all gon die and leave from here like



I was a man with no name,
now im attributing mo fame,
But all of this aint gonna matter when i a die and say good bye so long,
Sianara ill have to catch you tomorra baby cause baby,

I,ll be in the sky
I,ll be there
Ooh all right
(x2)

I'll be in the sky

yea yea yea
yea yea yea
yea
I'll be in the sky
(x2)



Everyone here gonna die one day,
So while im here ima find my way,
Thats my forte,
thats why im here,
shit to open up your ears,
and speak this real.

Beatin down the block with a shoot ya,
the gold teeth dont really match with the suit,
Nowerdays folk would rather rap than go to school,
Cause they feel that if they black then they gotta have a tool,
But yall dont really seen that there,
After all everybody wanna kick back,
They wanna sit back,
They wanna sip Goose,
They wanna get down,
They wanna get loose,
They wanna get blown,
They wanna see the truth,
They wanna get old just like you,
But since they aint nobody gon be responsable,
Ima gonna have to be the one to show,
