Chorus- Bruno Mars
Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasin' but my time would be wastin'
They got nothin' on you baby....Nothin on you baby
They might say hi, and i might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'cuz they got nothin' on you baby (nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin' on you baby)
(nuh-nuh-nothin' on you baby)
nothin' on you baby (nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin' on you baby)
(nuh-nuh-nothin' on you baby) yeah...

Verse 1- b.o.b
I know you feel where I'm comin' from (from)
Regardless of the things of my past that I've done (done)
Most of really was just for the heck of the fun (fun)
On a carousel so around I spun (spun)
With no direction so I'm tryin' to get some (some)
Tryin' to chase skirts in the summa sun (sun)
And so I lost more than I had ever won (wha?)
And honestly I ended up with none (huh?).


Pre Chorus- Bruno Mars
There's so much nonsense on my concience
And I'm thinkin "Maybe I should get it out",
And I don't wanna sound redundant but I was wonderin'
Is there somethin' that you wanna know (somethin' that you wanna know)
Never mind that you should let it go (we should let it go)
We don'T wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts just let 'em go, (go) go, (go), go.

Chorus- Bruno Mars
Beautiful girls, all over the world

(nuh-nuh-nothin' on you baby)
Nothin on you baby (nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin' on you baby)

They might say hi, and i might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'cuz they got nothin' on you baby (nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin' on you baby)
(nuh-nuh-nothin' on you baby)
nothin' on you baby, yeah.

Verse 2- b.o.b
Hands down there will never be another one (nope!)
I've been around and I've never seen another one (one)
Because your style is somethin' they've got nothin' on (on)
And you out when you got nothin' on (haha)
Baby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic,
Your my Superwoman call me Mr.Fantastic, Stop....
Now think about it

Pre Chorus 2- Bruno Mars
I've been to London, to Paris, even way up there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, New Orleans but you always steal the show (show)
Like a Nintendo 64, if you never knew well now you know, (know), know, (know), know
