Verse 1:
Well I'm trapped on a roller coaster, and they won't let me go, so it's totally bogus!
And every single day it gets colder, colder.
And my mood get low like the lowest sofa. (?)
Can somebody tell me where to go? Somewhere far away where it can't go wrong!
There's way too many snakes on this globe. Now everybody sing it, everybody sing it!

Chorus:
We Created A Monster, Created A Monster!
But nobody wants 'em, but nobody wants 'em,
Created A Monster, Created A Monster!
But nobody wants to kill it...

So long!
Well since there's no where to go, (No where to go!)
I guess I'll be on the road, (Good-bye!)
Wherever my soul will go! (C'mon!)
Good-bye! (C'mon!) So long!
(Well where you goin'?) Outer Spa-ya-ya-ya-ya-yace.
(Ha, Ha!) Outer Spa-ya-ya-ya-ya-yace.
(Good-bye!) Outer Spa-ya-ya-ya-ya-yace. (So Long)
Good-bye! So long!

Verse 2:
To get where I am, I can give you directions, I
In the future I can get with the Jetsons, I
Maybe be leave you so give me suggestions, (???)
Fuck elections! The whole planet's infected!
Uhh, call a docter I can use an arection,
Uhh, call the Revrend, I can make a confession,
(................) Atomic Nuclear Weapon! (WTF...?)
Everybody Sing it, Now Everybody Sing it!

Chorus:
We Created A Monster, Created A Monster!
But nobody wants 'em, but nobody wants 'em,
Created A Monster, Created A Monster!
But nobody wants to kill it...

So long!
Well since there's no where to go, (No where to go!)
I guess I'll be on the road, (Wazzup!)
Wherever my soul will go! 
Good-bye! (Good-bye.) So long!
(Well where you goin'?) Outer Spa-ya-ya-ya-ya-yace.
(Ha, Ha!) Outer Spa-ya-ya-ya-ya-yace.
(Good-bye!) Outer Spa-ya-ya-ya-ya-yace. (So Long)
Good-bye! So long!
