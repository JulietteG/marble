Well I got up today
and I put on my shades
and I said I was fine (Im fine)
but everyone knew that I was lying
if you look at my face
and the way that I behave
you will still see a disguise
even if you was blind (damn)

[Chorus]
But now I'm saying bye, goodbye
American Dreaming
American dreaming
its not that hard to find
cause most of the time
Im American sleeping
I barely can see it
but now I'm saying bye, goodbye

As I rhyme and I rap
the average listener is blind to the fact
that my mind has been tapped
I carry the World as it lies on my back
my spine coulda cracked so
please pay me no mind as I laugh
this is all a stage every line is an act
killing the American dream with a trap
like a axe, Ima put it in a sack
Ima put it in the back of the black cadilliac
cause Im travelling
some say that Im throw like a javelin
Im really tryna expose to the galaxy
then break off the mould to normalities
people called the election a tradegy
looking at the screen like this cant be happening
I ain't saying that Im some kind of activist
but someting be attacking us

[Chorus]

Okay, bring it back
I was filling my time just posing
like a mannequine you pass by
tryna make it one day to the big league
where the girls ain't hard to find
all the time I was just searching
a plastic promised land
and I got myself entangled in a corporated plan (sign here)
but a dream is nothing
and its everything at the same time
so you never know when you might wake up
and find you was just living a lies
goodbye, just like Trey said
goodbye America, Goodbye
cause anything but the truth is a waste of time

[Chorus]---
