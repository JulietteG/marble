Well it was just a dream just a moment ago
I was up so high looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars on a saturday night
They say what goes up must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

Cause I'm glide enough that i oh so very high
That if the clouds were to drop me
Then id fall out the sky
I don't really know why I'm here
I guess I'm just here for the ride
I swear it feels like I'm dreaming
It's vividly defined yeah
So call me whatever you want
Telling them whatever you like
But lets get one thing straight
You know my name
So i run this town when I'm on this mic
Yeah so here i go B.o.B Bobby Ray i don't know b dot o
But i know that i flow rack them up knock them down dominoes
Then i go where my story goes
I know i done been down here before
Coming through my east Decatur home
Cause i was in the cold trying to keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house
Now I'm in your stores
Now I'm everywhere that your ipod goes
everything i seen was a dream just a moment ago

Well it was just a dream just a moment ago
I was up so high looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars on a Saturday night
They say what goes up must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

Yeah by far much lower than where that payment is
Cause there ain't no parachute that they make for this
Cause i put my pain my heart my soul my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how i feel then you can related to this
I just blazeded this maybe roll one up and take a hit
Toast to the good life and take a sip
Vaca everyday and take a trip
It's easy to see i was late for this
But to the whom to the grave i spit
Just to show y'all niggas what greatness is
yeah I'm talking very loosely like making movies
To picture my life boy you need a higher resolution
I use to cut class in the day and run away at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class and i don't even write

Well it was just a dream just a moment ago
I was up so high looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars on a Saturday night
They say what goes up must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall---Lyrics submitted by Harrison.
