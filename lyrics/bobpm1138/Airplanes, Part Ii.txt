[Chorus - Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

[Bridge]
Dreaming.
(oh oh oh oh)
Of falling (mmm mmm mmm mmm)
Dreaming (ooh oh oh oh)

[B.o.B - Verse 1]
(ya) Lets pretend like its 98
Like Im eating lunch off of styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-town)
Hoping for a record deal to ignore my pain (ya)
Now lets pretend like Im on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (woo)
Okay
And everybody know my name (Bob) and everywhere I go people wanna hear me sing (oh)
Oh yeah and I just dropped my new album on the first week I did Five-Hundred Thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall and then a world tour just to top it all off
And lets pretend like they called me the greatest selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no-one ever hated
Lets try to use imagination

[Chorus]

[B.o.B - Verse 2]
Okay lets pretend like this never happened (never)
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper (rapper)
Like I didnt write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now lets pretend like it was all good (good) 
Like I didnt live staring in a notebook (notebook)
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (should)
But I ain't have neighbors that's why they call it hood (hood yeah)
Now lets pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever call me B.o.B aka Bobby Ray
Im talking back before the mix tapes (yeah)
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before the ever once compared me to Andre 
Before I ever got on Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face, so lets just pretend, and make wishes out of airplanes

[Chorus]

[Bridge II]
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone (gone gone) and just memories
(oh oh)
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone (gone gone)

[Eminem]
Alright lets pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Lets pretend things would have been no different
Pretend he procrastinated had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin, they could blow away with the wind
Marshall youre never gonna make, it makes no sense to play the game there aint no way that youll win
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasnt time to move and schools were changing again
He wasnt socially awkward and estranged as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as sh-t
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as sh-t
F-ck a talent show in a gymnasium bitch you wont amount to sh-t quit daydreaming kid
You need to get your cranium checked you thinking like an alien it just aint realistic
Now pretend they aint just make him angry with this sh-t and there was no one he could even Aim when hes pissed it
And his alarm went off to wake him off but he didnt make it to the rap Olympics left to his Plane and he missed it
Hes gon have a hard time explaining to Hailey and Laney these food stamps and this WIC sh-t
Cuz he never risked sh-t he hopes and he wished it but it didnt fall in his lap so he aint even Here
He pretends that

[Hayley Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now

Uh hmm oh oh oh ooo
Uhu mm aalalalaa---Lyrics submitted by bob.
