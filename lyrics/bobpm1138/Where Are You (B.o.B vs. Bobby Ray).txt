[B.o.B]
Whatever happened to Bobby Ray, he used to be here for us
Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust
We never hear from you, youre constantly changing
And your relatives always miss you at family occasions
And your mother misses you too
Since all the fortune youve been too busy recording
Now she feels unimportant and your daddys been going through it
Since he lost his mother
The least you could do is call him and show him, you support him
I never thought you would sell out
Youre becoming so cocky
I asked you for a picture after your show
You walked right by me, Im like
Aint this the dude that said that it aint about the price tag
Now on your records all that you do is brag
Come on Bob, I thought you was better than that dog
What happened to Cloud 9 and Generation Lost
You were my idol, just when I thought I give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody)

I heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody)
(melody, melody, melody)

[Bobby Ray]
Whatever happened to B.o.B. he once was my favourite
I swear to God that I had all of his mixtapes on my player
He was hood, but sooo different at the same time
It was like a breath of fresh air, everytime he rhymed
And everybody was on him and the world fell in love
The girls, the money, the lifestyle
All the above
I guess hes stopped giving a fuck
For all of his little people
With your shades on, we cant even see you
Is that what happens, when somebody makes it off of rapping
They taste the fame and change likes it just automatic
Wheres the integrity? you on that other shit
You dont even sound the same, I liked your other shit
But well stand beside you, cause somewhere deep inside you
Theres more than what meets the eye
I swear on the Bible you were my idol
Just when I thought I give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody)

I heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody)
(melody, melody, melody)

I watched my whole life change in a couple of years
Who woulda ever thought I woulda caught the world by the ears
I swear, this shit is so much bigger than I had figured
But if it wasnt meant to be this wouldnt be my career
Its like, people only see it, the way it appears
But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears
Blood sweat and tears, we cry but always swear theres tears
In the middle of this rap game on the battle field
All of these shock jock interviews, tryna phone me
You never know whos gonna play you and make you look phoney
I live and die for my team, these niggas are more than my homies
We put it all on the line, we gave up all our belongings for this rap shit
Cause at the end of the day, it aint just rap shit
I call it making a way for our survival
Just when I thought I gave up on everything
I dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody)

I dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody)
(melody, melody, melody)
I dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody)---
