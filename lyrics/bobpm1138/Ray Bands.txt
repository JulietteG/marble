She wanna pop bottles and chill with older folk
Hang with all the models and all the centerfolds
Showing off her body now watch her strike a pose
Tryna get beside me so she can get a hold of the ol'
Bobby Ray Bands
She want them Ray Bands
She want them Ray Bands (Bobby Ray Bands)
She want them Ray Bands (Bobby Ray Bands)
She want them Ray Bands (Bobby Ray Bands)

She wants them Ray Bands cause them bands are gorgeous
She looking for a sponsor and I ain't talking corporate
She after that endorsement
Ever since she saw me on the Forbes list
She be getting zero's from heroes
They're Zorros with horses
Like Mustangs and Porsches imported from Japan
She from Atlanta but she on that Cali strand
That's that overseas money, call 'em Taliban
She WMD, aw yeh spring to winter
So pencil her in for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner
Ain't no incidentals
She want them bands like a freelance parade (All day)
Compliments of Bobby Ray

She wanna pop bottles and chill with older folk
Hang with all the models and all the centerfolds
Showing off her body now watch her strike a pose
Tryna get beside me so she can get a hold of the ol'
Bobby Ray Bands
She want them Ray Bands
She want them Ray Bands (Bobby Ray Bands)
She want them Ray Bands (Bobby Ray Bands)
She want them Ray Bands (Bobby Ray Bands)

Look, she want them Ray Bands, them Ray Bands, that coin
Gourmet top-house sirloin, courtesy of ya boy
She she she she think I owe her, Des Moines
Quit being annoying, do something useful and roll a joint
You see business over bullsh-ts my company policy
And my team's going green and I ain't talking 'bout pottery
You tryin' to hit the party, she tryin' to hit the lottery
And if they watchin' girl, grandfather clockin' it
I don't pop bottles, I got pop dollars
And after Strange Clouds, I'mma drop my rock album
Violent bravado, call me Bobby Bravo
Every play is crucial, yeah that's my motto

Said wassup, yeah we do this all the time
Where the real freaks who wanna have a good night?
If ya feel that, let it go it's alright
The music got you movin' and you're losin' your mind
So let me know if it's alright
I just wanna know, shawty, have a good time
So why don't you let go, let go
You're losing control
The music got you movin' and you're losing your mind

She wanna pop bottles and chill with older folk
Hang with all the models and all the centerfolds
Showing off her body now watch her strike a pose
Tryna get beside me so she can get a hold of the ol'
Bobby Ray Bands
She want them Ray Bands
She want them Ray Bands (Bobby Ray Bands)
She want them Ray Bands (Bobby Ray Bands)
She want them Ray Bands (Bobby Ray Bands)---Lyrics submitted by Erica Lacy.
