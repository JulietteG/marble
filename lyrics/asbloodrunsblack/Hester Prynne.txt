Your vision of a new life was impure
gave into temptation and threw away what you believed
your immaculate state of mind was only temporary
your faults your faults got the best of you

your commitment, your pledge to another human being
was destoryed through curiosity
your goal in life is far out of reach
you'll find yourself out of luck

branded into your chest - domestic livestock
society kept track of your defiance
branded into your chest - domestic livestock

terror embedded into your thick mind
bearing your emblem with pride
plagued by its purpose in genesis
subsequently flaunting its meaning

your vision of a new life was impure
gave into temptation and threw away what you believed

infestation

walk away

your immaculate state of mind was only temporary
your flaws your faults got the best of you

your guard was let down
your past turned against you---Lyrics submitted by alex.
