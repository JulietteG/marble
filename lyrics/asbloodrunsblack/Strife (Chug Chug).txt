The risk of failure's what makes life worth living
A chance is given more
Doors can shut to make new beginnings
Another chance to explore
Explore
Strive for more

Would you carry out what you walked through?
Would you carry out and make a fucking move?
A plane life you live, walking on what you made
Took shit for granted, and threw it all away
Then along came 1 then 1 and 3
Then 1 more a set to see
A set to see
You tried to push us away, you pushed it away
You it all away, you pushed us away

The risk of failure's what makes live worth living
A chance is given more
Doors can shut to make new beginnings
And I'm not depressed from it
It's just your fucking testament
We tried over and over again, to pull you through
Now we're at the very end but where are you?

Another band, a fallen dream another outcast
Another 1 to a band, fallen dream, a fucking outcast
Now that you're gone we carry out this torch
The one you threw away with no remorse
No fuel to light the fire, but we're still going strong

[chant:] Going strong, going strong---Lyrics submitted by christian.
