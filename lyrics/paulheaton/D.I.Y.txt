(feat. Jacqui Abbott)

Some girls lose their boys after years
Some lose them right at the start
Standing in line, its a question of time
Whos gonna be the next broken heart
My heart belonged to a love so strong
I would love him til the day that I die
But I didnt lose my love to the Lord above
I lost him to a D I Y

D  she was so determined to take him right out of my hands
I  if youre idle enough they can steal from the very first dance
Y  she was young and pretty and young and pretty is better than I
But we gave them all our kisses
Now they found another Mrs cause we lost him to a D I Y

Some women feel if you put her on a seal it will keep your fella out of reach
But it aint no soul you can grab them from below
Thats a lesson every woman can teach
But my man was just the sort you could trust
You could look a fella right in the eye
If it wasnt for deceiving 
But suddenly he was leaving cause we lost him to a D I Y

D  she was so determined to take him right out of my hands
I  if youre idle enough they can steal from the very first dance
Y  she was young and pretty and young and pretty is better than I
But we gave them all our kisses
Now they found another Mrs cause we lost him to a D I Y

L  A  D  I  E  S
Come on girls, if shes wearing a dress
T  H  I  E and F
She got high heels and she couldnt care less
W  O  M  E  N
Come on girls, itll happen again
H  I  S  T  O  R  Y
Come on folks, just an ordinary guy

D  she was so determined to take him right out of my hands
I  if youre idle enough they can steal from the very first dance
Y Y Y  she was young and pretty and young and pretty is better than I
But we gave them all our kisses
Now he found another Mrs cause I lost him to a D I Y---Lyrics submitted by Alison Carpente.
