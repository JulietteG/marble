And what I do is what I feel
    And what I feel is where I have to go
    And where I go is where you are
    My love, my fear, my beating heart
    My simple answer that Ill never know

    And what I say is what I know
    And what I know is what my senses say
    And what my senses say is this
    That where Im scared to go is bliss
    And when I dare to take on, makes my day

    And what I do is what I feel
    And what I feel is where I have to go
    And where I go is where you are
    My love, my fear, my beating heart
    My simple answer that Ill never know

    And what I say is what I know
    And what I know is what my senses say
    And what my senses say is this
    That where Im scared to go is bliss
    And when I dare to take on, makes my day---Lyrics submitted by Alessandro.
