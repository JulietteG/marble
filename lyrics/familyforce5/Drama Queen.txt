(chick-a-POW! don't shoot me down! - - oh no- how low can you go?)

you're so dra-ma-tic
you're so dra-ma-tic (matic)

driving fast to get to work-
Queen is there just being a jerk.
a-runnin' her mouth a million miles an ho-ur
she's talkin' trash; it's goin' so-ur.
that stuff that makes ya hurt;
cuts ya down, make ya hit the dirt. *sing;
she's got that diva thing, that D-I-V-A diva thing *sing!

why can't you say you're so-ry-
for treatin' me so nau-ghty?
just want an a-pol-o-gy!
is that against your per-son-al the-ology?
wat'd i do to de-serve this?
how'd i get on your bad list?
just want to make it right-
please Queen, please;
lets not fight.

*let's not fight; let's not fight
i don't wanna fight tonight.
you had your chance to right your wrong-
cant we all just get along????*

       ~chorus~
you- go & talk behind my back;
don'cha know that's wack!
it's a per-son-al attack!
oooooohhhh SNAP!
some friend you are to me
you're Miss Per-son-al-ity!
are you blind to see-
you're such a drama QUEEEN!

you're so dra-mat-ic (matic)

fresh off the chopping block-
she cut me deep,
and it hurts a-lot.
she hit me with her best shot-
and never gave a se-cond thought.
that's too much drama for me mama.

why do you like to stir it?
when i am near, you throw- fits!
you cry "oh ME ME ME!" 
ain't you got no de-cen-cy?
you dish-it-out, i take- it
i wish you'd just stop fakin'.
in your mind, your grass is green
but i know YOU'SE a drama queen!

   YOU'RE (you're such a) SUCH (you're such a) A DRAMA QUEEN (you're such a) you're such a drama queen!!!!

      ~chorus~

you're so dra-ma-tic!

she'll drama queen, if ya know what i mean
she'll get under the skin & make ya scream-
OW drama queen; i need a vaccine
cuz you so mean!
you got a di-sease i don't need
& it pays no heed to get it-
so ya better quit it!
cuz a friend in need is a friend indeed and you ain't that:
you'se a drama queen!

emphatic, dramatic-
you're like a phsyco-sy-matic
you're always so prob-lem-atic;
your drama is cin-e-matic.
there's no com-pa-ri-son
to the da-mage you've done.
but you've only be-gun
with your hit- and ruuuuuun!

         ~chorus~

you're so dra-ma-tic (...)
you're so dra-ma-tic (matic)---Lyrics submitted by Bailey.
