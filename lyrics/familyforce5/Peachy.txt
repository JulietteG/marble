I think about you all the time
But even though I don't talk to you
That doesn't even mean that we are through
I, see you as paradigm
Of a life that seems so amused
By all the things that I refuse
I think you're walkin' on broken glass
And I hope you're not going down fast
That all seemed so real to me
'Cause I was living in my own fantasy
You're running after a grand mistake
You're headed for the real heartache
And then you tell me that you think I'm wrong

[Chorus]
Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
'Cause now I feel so fine, and I feel so Peachy
Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
'Cause now I feel so fine, and I feel so Peachy

Friend, can't you see I'm trying to help you out
But your mind is stuck on things 
That leave you adrift with broken wings
You, wanna talk about God Philosophy
I don't think there's anything wrong
I've got time, in fact lifelong
I think you're walkin' on broken glass
And I hope you're not going down fast
And then you tell me that you think I'm wrong

[Chorus]

Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
'Cause now I feel so fine, and I feel so Peachy
Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
'Cause now I feel so fine, and I feel so Peachy
Don't bring me down
Cause I don't have time for that anymore

[Chorus x2]---Lyrics submitted by hannah.
