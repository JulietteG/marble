I will show you crazy, I'm a maniac
No more final warning, I'm not holding back
I ain't going nowhere, let the roof cave in
'Bout to blow up something, here goes nothing
Watch me hit the cray button

Cray [x3]

Let's get cray
Turn it all the way up
Got a double dose of bass
You'll love this so much
Get out of your head
Get out of your skull
If you ain't gettin' cray
Then you ain't got a pulse
A lunatic, a time bomb just got dropped
I get cray all day, it's my full time job
Wild like a wolfpack, howlin' at the moon
Attack, attack, you've been bitten by the boom

I ain't going nowhere, let the roof cave in
'Bout to blow up something, here goes nothing
Watch me hit the cray button

Cray [x3]

Put your fives in the sky if you're feelin' alive
Throw ten up in the air 'cause you don't care
Cray Bans on, rock your cranium
3-2-1, detonation

I wonder what happens when I hit the cray button?
I guarantee the whole place starts jumpin'

I wonder what happens if I hit the cray button? (button)
I guarantee the whole place starts jumpin'

I wonder what happens if I hit the cray button? (button)
I guarantee the whole place starts jumpin'

I wonder what happens if I hit the cray button? (button)
Imma do it!
Watch me hit the cray button
I hit the cray button
I hit the cray button

I pledge allegiance to the U.S. Cray (cray) , U.S. Cray, U.S. Cray
I pledge allegiance to the U.S. Cray (cray) , U.S. Cray, U.S. Cray ---
