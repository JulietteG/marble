I'd take a bullet for you
Bleed all my blood out for you
Be taken hostage, under the knife's edge
Pay all the ransom for you

Do the hard time for you
On the front lines for you
Bring on the pain, the ball and chain
Be executed for you

I'll cover for you, take a hit
I'm your alibi
I got your back
I'm living every day just to die

Every day I die for you
Throw me in the fire, I'd walk right through
I made a promise, it's an I-O-U
I'd D-I-E for Y-O-U

I'd D-I-E for Y-O-U
I'd D-I-E for Y-O-U
I'd die for you, die, D-I-E for you
I'd D-I-E, I'd die for you

Give me your paranoia
I'll walk the plank for you
Sous la guillotine, jusqu' a la fin
Willing to suffer for you

Interrogate me for you
Accept my fate for you
Put me in a noose, turn the dogs loose
Take all the hatred for you---Lyrics submitted by megan.
