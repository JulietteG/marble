time dont wait for no one, leavin' ya broken ecspecially when you under the gun
makes things complicated, leaving ya jaded toward everything thats under the sun.

tick tock tick tock goes the clock 
tick tock tick tock till i drop.
time don't phase me not a bit.
cause i give it to you, all of it.
death can't shake me from ya hand.
me minus you equals not a chance.
its good to know that when i go, you'll never ever let me,

never ever let me, never ever let me, never ever let me, never ever let me, go.

i want some face to face, just give that full embrace.
what did i hear you say? that you will never ever let me go. 
i'll never know when its my time to go. one thing i know fo'sho that you will never ever let me go.

The mind is a ticking time bomb, itching to go off impatiently it awaits the comb
it might be over in one little moment, before you know, it's all gone.

tick tock tick tock through the clock, tick tock tic tock through the bomb
it's good to know that when i go, you'll never ever let me,
never ever let me never ever let me, never ever let me, me go!

i want some face to face, just give that full embrace.
what did i hear you say? that you will never ever let me go!
i'll never know when it's my time to go, one thing i know fo'sho
that you will never ever let me go

one thing i'll never know. the time and place that i'll go.
death couldn't shake me from your hands!

you never let me go! i know you'll never ever never ever let me go!
you never let me go i know you'll never ever never ever let me goooo!

i want some face to face! just give that full embrace!
what did i hear you say!? that you will never ever let me go!
i'll never know! when it's my time to go!
one thing i know fo'sho! that you will never ever let me go!  (repeat till end of song.)---Lyrics submitted by shatea.
