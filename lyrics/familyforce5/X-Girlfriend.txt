Ok, I'm sitting in my living room
Listening to my favorite tune
Just to make me feel, make me feel
Alright, gonna put it all aside now
Ur not here by my side now
I can't believe this love thing's got me spinning round and round
Yes, I keep pursuing like a stalker
Just wanna talk to her
Think I'm gonna breakdown
What am I gonna do about this situation at hand
My paranoia is starting to kick in
A busy signal is all I ever hear
We used to talk a lot but now she's seemed to disappear

[Chorus]
I think I've found out
What's going on
About my girlfriend not calling me up on the phone
And if it's gonna be like this everyday I cannot c-cope
So where do I go from here
I found out that she's calling up my best friend
Who said he'd never ever ever go and do this again
I think I'm g'on take this knife outta my back and give it back to him
She just became my Ex-girlfriend

Ok, she kept it on the down-low
So tell me what's the deally-yo
I can't believe she did what she did to me
Alright, now bring me back my things gurl
Ur no longer in my world
I don't think that u need to be talking to me
All about how you said you love me
U miss me terribly
Well, I don't buy that at all
What am I gonna do about this situation at hand
My paranoia is starting to kick in
A busy signal is all I ever hear
We used to talk a lot but now she's seemed to disappear

[Chorus]
I think I've found out
What's going on
About my girlfriend not calling me up on the phone
And if it's gonna be like this everyday I cannot c-cope
So where do I go from here
I found out that she's calling up my best friend
Who said he'd never ever ever go and do this again
I think I'm g'on take this knife outta my back and give it back to him
She just became my Ex-girlfriend

She doesn't know where we stand
I hope she takes it just like I am
She doesn't know it at all

[Chorus x2]

What happened to us? Can you tell me?
What happened to us? Can you tell me where I went wrong?
What happened to us? What happened to us, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Katy.
