[Verse 1:]
Airborne, sound the air horn
It's a contagion, invasion, rampaging with no vaccination
Six feet down, coming out of the ground
Looks like it's getting around
It's a virus, apocalyptic,
You won't survive this
You can't predict it, hey!

[Verse 2:]
Chaotic, psychotic
Death defying, lifeless logic
It's scary, supernatural
Knock me down, I'm so come-back-able
Not dead, undead, a new creation
Zombie regeneration
Fresh flesh, but I don't need a headshot
Still hot, still rock

[Pre-Chorus:]
Worldwide, infected
I'm back, resurrected
Whole life I remember it fondly
Watch me walk like a zombie

[Chorus:]
Zombie zombie zombie,
Zombie zombie zombie,
Re-re-reanimated,
Back-back-back-back from the dead

[Post-Chorus:]
Walk, watch me walk, watch me walk,
Watch me walk like a zombie
Walk, watch me walk, watch me walk,
Watch me walk like a zombie

[Verse 3:]
I'm a zombie, who I want to be
Not a wannabe but a zombie
I know, insanity, unattainable, unchainable
Zombie-ance is uncontainable
Run for your-ru-ru-run for your life, what
Bon-Appetite, I got a new appetite
Transformed, be-be-be-be-reborn, uh
Love bites and it's in rare form ---Lyrics submitted by Shayla and Emiy.
