You energize me
Ive never felt this before
Oh, and its blinding
Brighter than the sun at its core

This heart that is beating
Without worth repeating
A fire to be something more

I glow in the dark
You are made of light
Glow all day
Glow all night
Like the stars up in the sky
We keep on shining you and I

I glow in the dark
You are made of light
Glow all day
Glow all night
We shine
You & I

I glow in the dark

You energize me
With a passion that could send me to war
Electrifying
From the heavens to the ocean floor

I glow in the dark
You are made of light
Glow all day
Glow all night
Like the stars up in the sky
We keep on shining you and I

I glow in the dark
You are made of light
Glow all day
Glow all night
We shine
You & I

I glow in the dark

Try to change me
Try, try to change me
Youve never change me
(Youll never change me)
I glow in the dark, dark, dark, dark
I glow in the dark, d-dark, dark

I glow in the dark
You are made of light
Glow all day
Glow all night
Like the stars up in the sky
We keep on shining you and I

I glow in the dark
You are made of light
Glow all day
Glow all night
We shine
You & I---
