In my house 
We dress to impress
Flip down your collar, man
You look like a mess

In my house
I see you let yourself in
Got no class, you talk trash 
You're under my skin

B Verse 1:
Don't try to mess with my girlfriend
I'm here to call you out

You try to hit on my girl
That's what I call a party foul

Chorus 1: 
You just committed your last party foul
You won't admit it, yeah, you bring the party down

Just bought a ticket, yeah, to get yourself thrown out
'Cause you submitted your last party foul

Verse 2:
It's loud in my house
So don't you dare turn it down
If you're bustin' up my system
Then you're bustin' up my crowd 

At my house
You got to know how to move
And if you can't dance
Get yourself out of my room

B Verse 2: 
Youre talkin' trash to my girlfriend 
Hey man that's not allowed

You've been infecting my household
That's your final party foul---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
