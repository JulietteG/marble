I got these memories,
they're all of you and me
I've been recording them ever
since I was seventeen
Push playback then rewind
I see us meeting for the very first time

A mental note of you, you sang my melody
First bar in a lifelong symphony
The prelude to a kiss
My heart's pounding when I reminisce

Press repeat
'Cause I want to see

The first time that I saw your face
The first time that you spoke my name
The first time that I heard you say
There's a first time with me everyday

The first time that I felt your touch
The first time I couldn't get enough

Another memory, when you first looked at me
I hit pause and then love hit me back
Under attack stopped me in my tracks
There you go again, your eyes
gave me a flashback

Remember that time, we stayed up all night
I swear we danced until we saw daylight
Step by step and frame by frame
Slow motion, let me see you again

Press repeat
'Cause I have to see

The first time that I saw your face
The first time that you spoke my name
The first time that I heard you say
There's a first time with me everyday

The first time that I felt your touch
The first time I couldn't get enough
The first time that I heard you say
There's a first time with me everyday

No matter what I do
I won't fast forward anything with you
I know you feel it too
The first time I saw love I was with you

The first time that I saw your face
The first time that you spoke my name
The first time when we talked all night
Was the first time love made sense in life

The first time that I felt your touch
The first time I couldn't get enough
The first time that I heard you say
There's a first time with me everyday---Lyrics submitted by megan.
