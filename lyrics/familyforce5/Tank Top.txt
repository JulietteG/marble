Scenie babies
Throwback 'cedes
Bleach-blonde hair and your neon shadies
Skinny jeans
Know what I mean
Roll the red carpet out the limousine

I see sad people
I see mad people
Stone-cold face
Looking like they bad people
I see hot people
I see not people
Everybody movin' like they ain't got a job people

[Chorus:]
Hey, yo, tank top
Make that tail drop
Hey, yo, tank top
Make that tail drop
Hey, yo, tank top
Make that tail drop
Make, make that tail drop
Make, make that tail drop

What's the matter
Copy-catter
If the club's too cold go on and put your swagger on
Go on go on go go on and put your swagger on
Go on go go put your swagger on

I see rad people
Leather clad people
I'm still mad at my deadbeat dad people
I see hot people
I see not people
Everybody movin' liket hey ain't got a job people

[Chorus]

I see hot people
Put your s, s, s swagger on
Go on go on go on, I see hot people
Go on go on put your, put your swagger on

To the lovers, the haters, please congratulate us
You got to get educated 'bout the 808'ers
I sent the boom-shaka-laka shaka-laka to your house
Don't let it smack ya in yo swagga-lackin' mouth

I fly non-stop, first class
You in coach, you in da back
You go slow, I go fast
You shut down while I go blast
Neeerrr, right past ya
Ya lookin' like anotha disasta
Just face it, you wasted
Kickin' up dust, you taste it

[Chorus x3]---Lyrics submitted by Kennedy Kresal.
