My Batteries died sometime ago 
Gotta heart shaped box where they must go
Corrosion's building everyday 
My flesh is leading me astray that's why I started to decay and I will slowly rot away but I can't feel that anyway 

This heart it wants to beat
These Lungs they want to breathe 
These eyes they wants to see
Gotta Mouth that wants to sing 

Desperation 
Needing U
Every last breath 
I scream for you
Shatter me into a million pieces...Make me new

Crush me, tear me, break me, mold me 
Make me what U want me to be
I am ur's for U to use
Oh, Take and Replace me with U

Needing more than just a jump start to get me through
My disconnection is now the issue.....

I miss my 1st love bad and its driving me mad
Just Like a mixed up crazy person out of his head
Its been a long long time I've been on the decline
I do an a-bout face so I can be replaced. 180!!! 

This heart it wants to beat
These Lungs they want to breathe 
These eyes they wants to see
Gotta Mouth that wants to sing

Desperation 
Needing U
Every last breath 
I scream for you
Shatter me into a million pieces...Make me new

Crush me, tear me, break me, mold me 
Make me what U want me to be---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
