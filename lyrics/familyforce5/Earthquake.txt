GET DOWN!!!!

I saw shawty dancin' on the floor
I'm kind of nervous to approach her though
she's so stylish like a supermodel
Should I meet her (Yes I think you oughta)

The needle dropped
My track was hot
we began to rock
Our eyes were locked

I LUV UR SONG
Yeah gurl sing along
She said DJ's MAKE MY HEARTACHE
I said Baby watch the place shake like an Earthquake

(Chorus)
Drop that 8o8
The wall's begin to shake
It's to much for the club to take
It's shakin' like an Earthquake
Devastation from the sounds I'm makin'
And there's no escaping from the bass
It's shakin' like an Earthquake

10.0 on the richter scale
It's shakin' like an Earthquake
Move ur tail
Bout that time my people all were quakin'
another 10.0 was in the makin'

Like a natural disaster
Run for the pasture
Cause the bass will flow
Take you out like El Nino

It's rumbling, crumbling, all the way down
It's tumbling, fumbling, You love that sound
CAN YOU TURN UP THE BASS?
Sorry gurl I can't hear in this place
I HAVE A REQUEST THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE!
Well, what you wanna hear gurl? Shake like an Earthquake?

(Chorus)

Drop that 8o8
The wall's begin to shake
It's to much for the club to take
It's shakin' like an Earthquake
Devastation from the sounds I'm makin'
And there's no escaping from the Bass
It's shakin' like an Earthquake

10.0 on the richter scale
It's shakin' like an Earthquake
Move ur tail

Ready?! OK!!!!

Boom boom, you broke it down, you broke it down, now build it up, 
build it up, build it up

Boom boom, you broke it down, you broke it down, now shake it up, 
shake it up, shake it up

Boom boom, you broke it down, you broke it down, now break it up, 
break it up, break it up, WOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!

(Chorus)

SHAKE IT ON DOWN x 3

MOVE URSELF WHEN YOU HEAR THAT SOUND---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
