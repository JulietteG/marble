Verse 1:
I saw you strut
Into the room
My heart started pumpin'
When you broke out them moves

Your heels dug in 
Straight through the floor
You're a machine, baby
Seek and destroy

Pre Chorus 1:
She must be crazy
She's got that feeling
Look out now she's a psycho killer

Chorus 1:
The dance floor is shredded to pieces
The way you rip it up has got my heart rate increasin'
The dance floor is obliterated
The way you tear it up has got my soul liberated

Chorus 2:
Rip it up 
Rip it up
Don't stop until it's torn up
Tear it up
Tear it up
It's just the fate of the dance floor

Verse 2:
She cuts a rug
Just like a razor
Then burns it down 
Like an incinerator 

She's a slayer
And it don't phase her
She's from the future 
She's a terminator

Pre Chorus 2:
Just like a chainsaw
Her teeth cut in
Watch out now here she goes again---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
