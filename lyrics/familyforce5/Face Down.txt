(Musical Intro)

I shut my eyes in search of sleep
Toss and turned and hoped for dreams
Awaken by your voice that was so clear,
And felt so near to me
I want your love, I need your touch
I've been missing you so much
I reachout for your hand, and now it feels like I am falling,
Down, Down, Down
Till I kiss the Ground, Ground, Ground

Fall Down (Fall Down), With my Face Down (Face Down)
I'm giving up me, myself and I
Its a bitter sweet taste, as I swallow my pride
Now I'm Face Down (Face Down), and I Stay Down (Stay Down)
If you see me standing up again
Just knock me back down so I can live Face Down
(FACE DOWN)

I'm on my face again
Its where I should have been
It brings me back to where I found you
Where I first fell for you
NEVER DEPENDING on myself
YOU AND ME and no one else
At least I touch your hand and now it feels like I'm falling into
Love, Love, Love
Can't get enough, of, love

Fall Down (Fall Down), With my Face Down (Face Down)
I'm giving up me, myself and I
Its a bitter sweet taste, as I swallow my pride
Now I'm Face Down (Face Down), and I Stay Down (Stay Down)
If you see me standing up again
Just knock me back down so I can live Face Down
(FACE DOWN)

Love Love Love
Can't get enough, of, love

Fall Down (Fall Down), With my Face Down (Face Down)
I'm giving up me, myself and I
Its a bitter sweet taste, as I swallow my pride
Now I'm Face Down (Face Down), and I Stay Down (Stay Down)
If you see me standing up again
Just knock me back down so I can live Face Down, 
I've got to live face down, I've got to live face down, I've got to live face down
(FACE DOWN)

I've got to live Face Down---Lyrics submitted by JSpencerK.
