Hands up in the sky
Don't care why
You feel like you can fly

We are phenomenon
We are phenomenon
We are phenomenon

I'll show you love
You show me love
Phenomenon

I'll show you love
You show me love
Phenomenon

Hands up in the sky
Don't care why
You feel like you can fly

We are phenomenon
We are phenomenon, phenomenon
We are phenomenon

I'll show you love
You show me love
Phenomenon

I'll show you love
You show me love
Phenomenon

Phenomenon
We are phenomenon

I'll show you love
You show me love
Phenomenon

I'll show you love
You show me love
Phenomenon

We are phenomenon
Phenomenon, phenomenon
We are phenomenon---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
