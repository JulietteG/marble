Verse 1:

Transmission radio, radio...respond if you're alive 
Give me a sign of life
I need to say to you, say to you...I've found a way to fight
One hope for all mankind 

We're gonna take control
Dancing is your weapon 
Let your moves unfold
Kill 'em with your steppin'

We can win this war
It's time to come together
Now we're stronger than we were before

Chorus 1: 

They're trying to take our lives (tryin to take our lives)
We will survive (we will survive)
We're running out of time, the world ends tonight
Unless we dance or die
Dan-dan-dance or die
Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh
Dan-dan-dance or die
Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh
Dan-dan-dance or die

Verse 2:

Transmission radio, radio...take back the night 
Dance for your right
I'm on my way to you, way to you...we can reunite 
And watch the sky ignite

They couldn't take the sound
They fall harder when they're bigger
Yeah they all crashed down 
Our party pulled the trigger

We won this war
Because we came together
Made 'em wish that they were never born

Chorus 2: 

They try to take your lives (tryin to take our lives)
But you will survive (you will survive)
Look into my eyes, don't say "Good-bye"
You gotta dance or die
Dance or die
Dan-dan-dance or die
Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh
Dan-dan-dance or die
Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh-oh Whoa-oh
Dan-dan-dance or die

Bridge:

One-two-three-four
I declare a dance war
Dance or die

Yeah it's five-six-seven-eight
Now we're gonna celebrate
Dance or die

Yeah it's one-two-three-four
I declare a dance war
Dance or die

Yeah it's five-six-seven-eight
Now we're gonna celebrate
Dance or die---Lyrics submitted by Meredith.
