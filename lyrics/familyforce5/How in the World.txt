Verse 1:
Stepping out on my own
The world was too big to face alone
The mission was clear
To find something sincere, a love unknown 

Pre Chorus 1:
I searched through all the universe
My heart crash-landed on the earth
I gave up on my love pursuit 
Until I discovered you

Chorus:
How in the world did I find someone like you
Why in the world after all that we've been through
If you weren't here with me right now, then I don't know what I'd do
In all of the world I found my heart in you

Verse 2:
Getting ready for take-off 
We're gonna break-off, get out of here
We'll be walking on air
We're gonna tear through the atmosphere

Pre Chorus 2:
Faster than the speed of sound
Gravity can't hold us down
When we touch we elevate
Let's just float away

Bridge:
This is the end of the life we once knew
How in the world did I live without you
This is the birth of a love so true
How in the world did I live without you---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
