It all goes back to the first kiss
It was the one I thought I'd never miss
Maybe we were one of the lucky ones
Maybe I'm just not quite strong enough

This was supposed to be the easy part
But breaking down is what I found hard
Now I'm wearing this smile that I don't believe in
Inside, I feel like screaming

She gave me every reason to believe
I'd found the one
But my doubts, somehow
They sold me out

I'm bruised and scarred
Save me from this broken heart
All my love will slowly fade and fall apart
Someone please sing this lovesick melody
Call my name if you're afraid
I'm just a kiss away

I'm finding out in the hardest way
The consequence of every mistake I've ever made
Baby, what's it like to be alone?
(Baby, what's it like to be alone?)
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know

She gave me every reason to believe
I'd found the one
[ Mayday Parade Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ] 
But my doubts, somehow
They sold me out

I'm bruised and scarred
Save me from this broken heart
All my love will slowly fade and fall apart
Someone please sing this lovesick melody
Call my name if you're afraid
I'm just a kiss away

So, baby, be honest
Is this what you wanted?
We lost where we started
And found out much more than we wanna know
(More than we wanna know)
About how we're letting go, oh
(About how we're letting go)

So, baby, be honest
Is this what you wanted?
We lost where we started
And found out much more than we wanna know

I'm bruised and scarred
Save me from this broken heart
All my love will slowly fade and fall apart
Someone please sing this lovesick melody
Call my name if you're afraid
I'm just a kiss away---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
