We used to be something surreal 
Others looked to us for what we built
We were ending until the point
The point in which we fell
We fell by the wayside, and slowly watched ourselves die
A lonely death in which, no one cared and no one came
When the walls cave in we only have ourselves to blame

And even if it's dark at least we'll be together
Slowly sinking in the earth to lay forever
You better grab a hold and hold on for your life
Because you don't get lucky twice
Now even if it's perfect, I can't get carried away
And motivate my tongue in twisted ways
It felt like a good night, for dancing in the moonlight
In empty streets, well, everybody's got a reason why
If we could only just get it right

Maybe it will all work out like in the movies
But I know Romeo must die before the ending
With a final poison kiss delivered gently
Because you don't get lucky twice, and that's the truth

Sing to me sweet, just like my memory
If New York City still moves me
Then I found something real
I'll be okay, I could go on for days
But I just don't have the courage that it takes to be real

And even if it's dark at least we'll be together
Slowly sinking in the earth to lay forever
You better grab a hold and hold on for your life
Because you don't get lucky twice
No, you don't get lucky twice!---Lyrics submitted by Scarlet Rose.
