Tonight there's one thing left
And I haven't said it yet
I'm falling and the writing's on the wall
Today was misery
And I just can't believe this happened
And I was writing it all down
She held onto my heart
But now my only star is falling
And it's burning to the ground
Now I'm crying out
"Secret love, my escape,
Take me far, far away, 
Secret love, are you there? 
Will you answer my prayer?"
Please take me anywhere but here
Anywhere but here
Your all I've got right now
No one else figures out this feeling
And how lonely it can get
These words can cut right through
cause all along i knew
you're sorry, but you haven't said it yet
but i wont forget
"Secret love, my escape
Take me far, far away
Secret love are you there?
Will you answer my prayer?"
Please take me anywhere but here
When we're together thoughts of her disappear
If i fell to pieces you'd heal this pain i feel
"Secret love, my escape
Take me far, far away
Secret love, are you there?
Will you answer my prayer?
Secret love, my escape
Take me far, far away
Secret love, are you there?
Will you answer my prayer?"
Please take me anywhere but here
Anywhere but here...---Lyrics submitted by ben.
