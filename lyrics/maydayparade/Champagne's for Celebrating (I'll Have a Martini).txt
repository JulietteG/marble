She left her books, her car, her clothes, and a note
But all she wrote was tonight I'm leaving on a train
She said shes headed west to make it right for one more night and
Well I don't blame her if she is

But he thinks it's just one more sunset
And after all its her fault if she hasn't caught on yet

So why'd you have to go
Is there something I could say
To make you turn around
'Cause its nights like these I wish I'd said don't go
Is there anybody there
Can anybody help 
To get me out of here
'Cause your walking down a road that I cant go

She said shes headed west to make it right
for one more night and 
Well I don't blame her if she is

But he thinks it's just one more sunset
And after all it's her fault if she hasn't caught on yet

So why'd you have to go
Is there something I could say
To make you turn around
'Cause its nights like these I wish I'd said don't go
Is there anybody there
Can anybody help 
To get me out of here
'Cause your walking down a road that I cant go

So much is on I just cant handle this 
I lost myself inside a drunken kiss and I
All I ever wanted was to walk you home
Save the sad song for the sing along

And oh my god I just can't handle this
I lost myself inside a drunken kiss and I
All i ever wanted was to walk you home 
Save the sad song for the sing along

And she said she'll be my turn again (turn again)
As the record on the stereo plays
Her favorite song for two whole days
And the track stretched out for miles and miles
And what she'd give for one more smile
And how she hoped he missed her
'Cause god she missed how he would kiss her

So why'd you have to go
Is there something I could say
To make you turn around
'Cause its nights like these I wish I'd said don't go
Is there anybody there
Can anybody help 
To get me out of here
'Cause your walking down a road that I can't go

So why'd you have to go
Is there something I could say
To make you turn around
'Cause its nights like these I wish I'd said don't go
Is there anybody there
Can anybody help 
To get me out of here
'Cause your walking down a road that I can't go

Yeah your walking down a road that I can't go
Yeah your walking down a road that I can't.---Lyrics submitted by Katey.
