Right love, the wrong intention.
Some things will never change.
I'll keep my soul if you can promise the same.
Someday I'll fly away.
Count down from ten for a brand new day.
This year is over and I'm feeling like a Rolling Stone.

One mistake at a time
Until you learn to keep it all
Condensed and buried deep inside
It hurts a little at first, but it gets better in time.
My heart is holding my mind.
Oh, and now it's gone.

There's gotta be a better way to show what I'm feeling
All for a name I won't ever say.
I miss the glamour of your camera flash.
You're gonna need it when the lights go down.

Let go and make-believe we're singing in the streets.
You're only happy when you're making a scene.
Well that's just fine with me.
I'm never one to disagree.
This year is over and I'm feeling just as dandy again.

That's okay, but you're timed
Cause you're never gonna see another morning without me.
You're just a little, oh, you're just a little too shy.
I think I will be alright.
Now, here I go.

There's gotta be a better way to show what I'm feeling
All for a name I won't ever say.
I miss the glamour of your camera flash.
You're gonna need it when the lights go down.

There's gotta be a better way to show what I'm feeling
All for a name I won't ever say.
I miss the glamour of your camera flash.
I only need it when I'm coming down

I start to think I'm crazy every day after New Year's.
She said, "I need those Florida stars."
I miss the glamour of your camera flash.
You're gonna need it when the lights go down.---Lyrics submitted by dvmoo.
