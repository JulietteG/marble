Tear in two, she lies awake,
The moon lights up, the moon like day,
Another night she spends alone, 
Without his touch her skin so cold.

The blood that's running through her veins,
With every beat theres no escape,
Lost in everything she trust,
Still cant seem to get enough.

Even though the world she loves,
It wont ever be the way it was,
And his heart of stone left hers breaking.


(CHORUS)
Every night she cries, 
And dies a little more
Each time
Say you love me.
(You love me)

Nothing left to die, 
Say you love me,
And the silence will set her free.


Memories they take her back,
Every moment fades to black,
Every kiss and every taste,
She wishes time would ease the pain.

Even though the world she loves, 
It won't ever be the way it was,
And her heart is weak,
Her hands are shaking.


(CHORUS)
Every night she cries,
And dies a little more
Each time
Say you love me. 
(You love me)

Nothing left to die,
Say you love me, 
And the silence will set her free.

And every night she cries.


I dont know if i'll ever make this right,
Cause I am just so broken 
by the bitterness of loneliness,
And im so scared of this.
2 Xs

Even though the world she loves,
It won't ever be the way it was,
And his heart of stone left hers breaking.


(CHORUS)
Every night she cries,
And dies a little more inside,
Say you love me.
(You love me)

Nothing left to die, 
Say you love me, 
And the silence will set her free.

Every night she cries.

The silence will set her free.---Lyrics submitted by shawna.
