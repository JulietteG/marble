We're stuck in remission
Our planes going down
So what will I think of
Before I hit the ground
I'll stop my complaining
If you'll save me now
I'm scared that I've lost it all
(And I'm over waiting)
How long does it take to fall
(For something that won't come)

Cause I thought you were the one
And I'd never let you go, whoa

And now we turn our music way up
Just so it drowns your voice out
And I'll read my thoughts out loud
Now I'm burning every letter
Each word was so hard to write
This is the last goodbye I'll speak of forever

We're stuck in remission
Our plane can't be found
I feel like I'm drowning
But I'm lost in the clouds
I'll call on the angels
To help me get down
But I hope they just let you fall
I know you were the one

Now we turn our music way up
Just so it drowns your voice out
And I'll read my thoughts out loud
And now I'm burning every letter
Each word was so hard to write
This is the last goodbye I'll speak of forever

This fire sparked a long, long time ago 
I'll watch this work of art
Now till the ashes glow
I knew these phone calls 
That brought me closer
Would end in dial tones 
So this is closure
(I hope you burn)

Now I turn my music way up
Just so it drowns your voice out
And I'll read my thoughts out loud
Now I'm burning every letter
Each word was so hard to write
This is the last goodbye I'll speak of forever---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
