I look back to the one and only summer time
And my girl was the envy of every friends of mine
She slept safely in my arms
We were so young and invincible

Closed lips, she was never one to kiss and tell
Those trips in the summer never went so well
Young love is such dumb love
Call it what you want it was still enough

And still out of my reach
And still all of the things
That I want in my life
How could I ask you to leave me?

And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?

Our breath smelled of cigarettes and alcohol
We'd walk down the beach counting every star
Our hearts beat inside our chest
Leaving us gasping for every breath

Her smile with the wind blowing through her hair
Was so contagious in the air
So satisfying and I'm still smiling

And still out of my reach
And still all of the things
That I want in my life
How could I ask you to leave me?

And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?

We're falling down, can we pick up the pieces?
We're at an all time low, how do we get it back?
We're falling down, can we pick up the pieces?

We're falling down, can we pick up the pieces now?

And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us....

We were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?

We were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?---Lyrics submitted by amanda.
