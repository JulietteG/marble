She said, boy, you better say you're sorry
Don't think forgiveness will come easy
Cause its all that I have to give
And boy, I get the strangest pleasure
Just sitting on these city roof-tops
And see the lights that go on for miles

And Im dreaming all the time
My heart is racing, yeah
Im dreaming all the time
Wont you be mine?

Amber Lynn, Ive got three days to keep away
Ive been waiting on that white horse, oh for all these days
Amber Lynn, youve got me all wrong
Sweet love of mine, bring me closer to that Florida line
Amber Lynn wont you be mine
And take me away, tonight

I am stuck between the lines
It just wont come out right
Till I find mine, Till I find mine
Amber Lynn, I wont forget
The simple things you know, you know me best
But I cant seem to find a way in you

Now Im dreaming all the time
My heart is racing, yeah
Im dreaming all the time
Wont you be mine?

Amber Lynn, Ive got three days to keep away
Ive been waiting on that white horse, oh for all these days
Amber Lynn, youve got me all wrong
Sweet love of mine, bring me closer to that Florida line
Amber Lynn wont you be mine
And take me away

Amber Lynn, youve got me wishing for the stars tonight
And Ive been messed up, but oh, you got here just in time
You saved my life, and I dont ever think Ill find the words to say
Amber Lynn, Ive got three days to keep away

Amber Lynn, Ive got three days to keep away
Ive been waiting on that white horse, oh for all those days
Amber Lynn, youve got me all wrong
Sweet love of mine, bring me closer to that Florida line
Amber Lynn wont you be mine
And take me away, tonight
Take me away, tonight
Take me away, tonight
Take me away, tonight
Take me away, tonight---Lyrics submitted by Amber Nicole.
