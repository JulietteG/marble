I swear that you don't have to go
I thought we could wait for the fireworks
I thought we could wait for the snow
To wash over Georgia and kill the hurt

I thought I could live in your arms
And spend every moment I had with you
Stay up all night with the stars
Confess all the faith that I had in you

Too late I'm sure, and lonely
(Another night, another dream wasted on you)
Just be here now, against me
You know the words so sing along for me baby

(chorus)
For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

I thought with a month of apart
Together would find us an opening
And moonlight would provide the spark
And that I would stumble across the key
Or break down the door to your heart
Forever could see us not you and me
And you'd help me out of the dark
And I'd give my heart as an offering
(an offering)

Too late I'm sure, and lonely
Another night, another dream wasted on you
Just be here now, against me
You know the words so sing along for me baby

(chorus)
For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

And I will always remember you as you are right now to me
And I will always remember you now
Remember you now

So sleep alone tonight 
with no one here just by your side
Sleep alone tonight

(How does he feel, how does he kiss)
And sleep alone tonight
(How does he taste while he's on your lips)
with no one here just by your side
(How does he feel, how does he kiss)
Sleep alone tonight
(x3)

I can't forget you
(How does he feel, how does he kiss)
(And sleep alone tonight)
I know you want me to want you I want to
(How does he taste while he's on your lips)
(with no one here just by your side)
But I can't forget you
(How does he feel, how does he kiss)
(Sleep alone tonight)
So when this is over don't blow your composure baby
(x2)

I can't forget you
I know you want me to want you I want to---Lyrics submitted by Haley.
