I'm not your perfect picture
I'm not your favorite song
I'm not your hand to hold
Not the answer to your problems
So don't talk to me like I'm some hero laced in gold
And I can't love you 
No I can't love you enough
The thoughts been eating away what's love

And I can't love you 
No I can't love you enough

So promise me you'll try 
You're cut away from something that I can change
We're about to break
And even if you lie
The world will just forgive you
But don't forget that our love is dead

We're meant to be the strong ones
Yet the things we think about are the things we can't control
But I can't help but struggle
(But I can't help but struggle)
When the person that I am is the person I don't know

I've broken in the brightest city
And I fall apart to all the pretty songs
The thoughts been eating away once again
It's hard to talk when there's no meaning 
I'm half awake and far from dreaming
And every time you call my name
I swear to you I'll come 

So promise me you'll try 
You're cut away from something that I can change
We're about to break
And even if you lie
The world will just forgive you
But don't forget that our love is dead

I could be your heart
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me
We know what we are 

So promise me you'll try
To grab a hold of something to keep you safe
And I promise that I'll sing you to sleep
(I promise that I'll sing you to sleep)

Believe me
When they've been mistaken for a tragedy 
It's obvious your faking
But you're not convincing me you're singing along

So promise me you'll try 
You're cut away from something that I can change
We're about to break
And even if you lie
The world will just forgive you
But don't forget that our love is dead

I could be your heart
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me
We know what we are 

So promise me you'll try
To grab a hold of something to keep you safe
And I promise that I'll sing you to sleep

And even if you lie
The world will just forgive you again---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
