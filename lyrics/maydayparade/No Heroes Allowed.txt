Now it's hard to see with all these flashing cameras in my face
But I love the way they play through and shatters on the stage
Wonder where you are and what you think about this place
I can't help but miss the days and I'll write on every page

My hero she's the last real dreamer I know
And I can tell you all about her
I don't think I can fall asleep 'til I roll over
Can we just start over again
And I can tell you all about..
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til then

And now I just had this dream that we were on my bed again
Makin' love the way we did
Tell me how could I forget
This can't be healthy now the way I dream about your lips
But this just wasn't any kiss
I hope you're still not over this
Not at least 'til I get over you

My hero she's the last real dreamer I know
And I can tell you all about her
I don't think I can fall asleep 'til I roll over
Can we just start over again
And I can tell you all about..
I don't think I'll fall asleep 'til then

And now I've been left alone while you are lost in outer space 
Spreading love another way and we'll meet again someday
I've taken all I can and I keep thinkin' just the same
I guess I'll die another day, but I'm sure I'll be on my way
Maybe I'll collapse and float away
...Please go home

My hero she's the last real dreamer I know
And I can tell you all about her
I don't think I can fall asleep 'til I roll over
Can we just start over again
And I can tell you all about..---Lyrics submitted by Taylor James.
