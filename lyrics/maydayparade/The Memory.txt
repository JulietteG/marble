She is everywhere I go,
Everyone I see.
Winter's gone and I still can't sleep.
The Summer's on the way.
At least that's what they say,
But these clouds won't leave.

Walk away.
I'm barely breathing
As I'm lying on the floor.
Take my heart,
As you're leaving.
I don't need it anymore.

This is the memory.
This is the curse of having
Too much time to think about it.
It's killing me,
This is the last time.
This is my forgiveness.
This is endless.

Now, Spring has brought the rain,
But I still see your face.
And I can not escape the past,
Creeping up inside,
Reminding me that I
Can never bring you back.

This is the memory.
This is the curse of having
Too much time to think about it.
It's killing me,
This is the last time.
This is my forgiveness.
This is endless.
(This is endless.)
This is endless.
(This is endless.)

Someone
Help me 'Cause the memory
Convinced itself to tear me apart
And It's gonna succeed before long.

This is the memory.
This is the curse of having
Too much time to think about it.
It's killing me,
This is the last time.
This is my forgiveness.
This is endless.
(This is endless.)

Someone
Help me 'Cause the memory
Convinced itself to tear me apart
And It's gonna succeed before long.

She is everywhere I go,
Everyone I see.
But these clouds won't leave.---Lyrics submitted by James Michie.
