by the time i was your age i'd give anything
to fall in love truely was all i could think
thats when i met your mother the girl of my dreams
the most beautiful women that i'd ever seen

she said" boy can i tell you a wonderful thing?
i cant help but notice you staring at me
i know i shouldnt say this but i really believe
that i can tell by your eyes that you're in love with me."

now son, im only telling you this because
life can do terrible things

now most of the time we'd have to much to drink
we'd laugh at the stars and we'd share everything
too young to notice and too dumb to care
love was a story that couldn't compare

i said " girl can i tell you a wonderful thing?
i made you a present with paper and strings
open with care, now im asking you please
you know that i love you will you marry me?"

now son, im only telling you this because
life can do terrible things

you'll learn one day and i'll hope and i'll pray
that God shows you differently

she said "boy can i tell you a terrible thing?
it seems that im sick and ive only got weeks
please dont be sad now i really believe
you were the greatest thing that ever happened to me"

slow, so slow i fell to the ground on my knees
so dont fall in love theres just to much to lose
if youre given the choice then i beg you to choose
to walk away,walk away dont let her get you
i cant bare to see the same thing happen to you

now son, im only telling you this because
life can do terrible things---Lyrics submitted by Nena Morales.
