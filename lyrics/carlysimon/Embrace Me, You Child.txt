At night in bed I heard God whisper lullabyes
While Daddy next door whistled whiskey tunes
and sometimes when I wanted they would harmonize
There was nothing those two couldn't do

Embrace me you child
your a child of mine
and I'm leaving everything I am to you
go chase the wild and nightitme streets sang Daddy
and God sang pray, the devil doesn't get to you

I thought together they must sing the moon away
I thought that they must know each other well
for the magic that they made when they played 
wasn't lost between their heaven and their hell

Embrace me you child, 
you're a child of mine
and I'm leaving everything I am to you
go chase the wild and nightime streets sang Daddy 
and God sang pray, the devil doesn't get to you

then one night Daddy died and went to heaven
and God came down to earth and slipped away
I pretended not to know I'd been abandoned
but none sang the night into the day
and later nightime songs came back again
but the singers don't compare to those I knew
and I never figured out where God and Daddy went
there was nothing those two couldn't do

Embrace me you child
you're a child of mine
and I'm leaving everything I am to you
go chase the wild and nightime streets sang Daddy
and God sang pray, the devil doesn't get to you---Lyrics submitted by Dawn.
