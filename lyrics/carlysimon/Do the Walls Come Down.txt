DO the walls come down, when you think of me, 
do your eyes grow dim?
Do the walls come down, when you think of me,
do you let me in?
There's a penny in my pocket, from so many years ago
When he asked me would I be his queen,
well I guess so.
Do the walls come down when you think of me,
do your eyes grow dim.
Do the walls come down when you think of me,
do you let me in?
Do the walls come down.---Lyrics submitted by Lina.
