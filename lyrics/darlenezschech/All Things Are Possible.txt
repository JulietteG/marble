Almighty God my redeemer
My hiding place 
My safe refuge
No other name like Jesus 
No power can stand against you

My feet are planted on this rock
And I will not be shaken
My hope it comes from you alone 
My lord and my salvation

REFRAIN :

You praise is always o my lips
Your word is living in my heart
and i will praise you with new song
My soul will bless you Lord

You fill my life with greater joy 
Yes i delight myself in you
And i will praise you with new song
My soul will bless you Lord.

When I'm weak you make me strong
When I'm poor I know I'm rich 
For in the power of your love

All things are possible 
All things are possible---Lyrics submitted by Taiwo.
