All that is within me Lord will bless Your holy name,
I live my life to wor-ship You alone.
You brought me out of darkness,and in-to Your glorious light
Forever I will sing of Your great love.
Forever I will sing of Your great love.

VERSE 2:
I love to see You glorified, to see You lifted high,
I yearn to see all na-tions bow their-knee.
It's You alone Lord Jesus who can cause the coldest heart
To find Your love and everlasting peace.
To find Your love and everlasting-peace.

CHORUS:
Ho-ly, Ho-ly, Ho-ly is the-Lord.
Ho-ly, Ho-ly, Ho-ly is the-Lord.

VERSE 3:
And Your trumpet will sound,
And all of heaven will know
That the time has finally come
For the bride to take her place.
And we'll hear the angels-sing---Lyrics submitted by alden.
