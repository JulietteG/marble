My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath
All that I am
Never cease to worship You

Shout to the Lord
All the earth
Let us sing

Praise to the King
Mountains bow down
And the seas will roar
At the sound
Of Your name

I sing for joy
At the work
Of Your hands
Forever I'll love You
Forever I'll stand
Nothing compares
To the promise
I have in You

My Jesus, my Savior
Lord there is none like You
All of my days
I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love
