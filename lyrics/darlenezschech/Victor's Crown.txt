Verse 1:
You are always fighting for us
Heavens angels all around
My delight is found in knowing
That You wear the Victors crown
Youre my help and my defender
Youre my Saviour and my friend
By Your grace I live and breathe
To worship You

Verse 2:
At the mention of Your greatness
In Your Name I will bow down
In Your presence fear is silent
For You wear the Victors crown
Let Your glory fill this temple
Let Your power overflow
By Your grace I live and breathe
To worship You

Chorus:
Hallelujah
You have overcome
You have overcome
Hallelujah
Jesus You have overcome the world

Verse 3:
You are ever interceding
As the lost become the found
You can never be defeated
For You wear the Victors crown
You are Jesus the Messiah
Youre the Hope of all the world
By Your grace I live and breathe
To worship You

Bridge:
Every high thing must come down
Every stronghold shall be broken
You wear the Victors crown
You overcome
You overcome

Verse 4:
At the cross the work was finished
You were buried in the ground
But the grave could not contain You
For You wear the Victors crown---Lyrics submitted by Rochester Mugumbate.
