Verse 
I can't believe the way 
Your love has got a hold on me 
Each morning I wake to find You near 
Your lift me above my fears 
And set my feet on solid ground 
All of my days belong to You 

And I breathe in Your 
Breathe of life that fills my heart 
You are my all consuming fire 

Refrain 

And I stand here before You 
In wide-opended wonder 
Amazed at the Glory of You 
The power of heaven 
Revealing Your purpose in me 
As I'm reaching for You
