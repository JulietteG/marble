Till I see you face to face
This remains my hiding place
Where I listen as you gently speak to me

In this safety I will dwell. 
Every season I will tell
of the beauty and the glory of your presence

Lord I know you're here
Lord I know you're here 

As I seek you, you will find me
As I seek you, you will find me
As you draw me to yourself
As you draw me to yourself

For this peace I have abounds
in this joy, it fills my soul
There is nothing that compares to you my God

And I know you're here
Yes I know you're here

As I seek you you will find me
As I seek you you will find me
As you draw me to yourself
As you draw me to yourself

You're my friend here
Holy Spirit
Speak to me dear
Holy Spirit

Tenderness that makes me hold every breath
And to need you more


My searching heart was seeking for a place to find a home
You knocked upon the door, I ask you in

You Love me in to life and more this fullness now I know
That I am yours forever and you are mine

You are mine
You are mine
You are mine

Lord I know that you are here. In your presence I will dwell.
Love will hold me till I see you Face to Face---Lyrics submitted by Lynette Hill.
