I.
Your eyes is on the sparrow
And your hands it comforts me
From the end of the earth to the depth of my heart
Let your mercy and strength be seen

II
You call me to your purpose
As angels understand
To your glory may you draw all man
As you love and grace demand

Chorus:
And I will run to you
To your words of truth
Not by might, not by power, but by the spirit of God..
Yes I will run the race
Till I see you face
Oh let me live in the glory of your grace

(Back to second stanza)
(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Rhea.
