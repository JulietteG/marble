I am walking a new walk
Never be the same again
Dancing a new dance
In your holy spirit reign
Your breath as I is overwhelming
And set My spirit free

Living a new life 
Underneath the morning star
Dawning the new ways
In the shadow of your love
Your love is immeasurable
To deep to comprehend

Whoa!

Chorus:

My Jesus dream maker
My Jesus my giver
I'm living under the Kiss Of Heaven
And I'll never ever be the same again

Singing a new song
In the presence of my king
Giving Him my heart
That is all that I can bring
You lit a fire inside of me
That I thought will never burn again

[Chorus]

I'm living in the embrace of heaven
And I'll never ever be the same again

I thank you My Father
for all you've done alone
and you're going to do
My back behind me
 You before me
I'll press on for more

I'm living in the embrace of heaven
And I'll never ever be the same again

[Chorus 2x]

I'll never ever be the same again

My Jesus I surrender
My Jesus yours forever
I'm living in the embrace of heaven
And I'll never ever be the same again
[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Joy.
