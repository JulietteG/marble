[Ja Rule:]
Murda Inc
Haha it must be the ass
That got me like damn
If they get any fatter
Man the rule gonna hafta get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile
In the freakiest manners
J to the L.O.
Hello, no I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald
I'm the rule in the shot call
Off the wall
Like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now

[Jennifer:]
Ain't it funny
It's been awhile since you came around
Now ya wanna see what's goin' down
Tryin' to tell me how ya want my time
Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind
See it never had to be this way
You should have never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kinda lame
Knowin how the situation change

Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny

I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' cos my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learn.

Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say

Baby, I got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend

[Ja Rule & J.Lo:]
But maybe we can be friends
La da da da da da

[Jennifer]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryin' to make me sit and reminise
Tryin' to blind me with your blingin' bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool

Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny

Baby, is that you're girlfriend
I got my boyfriend

[Ja Rule & J.Lo:]
But maybe we can be friends
La da da da da da
