Hair of gold and eyes like stormy seas
You say you love me, want to marry me
And as Im looking for a wedding ring
You say I dont have to spend anything

Stay with me
Well be closer than the stars
Sunday Ill be gone
Stay with me
Well be closer than the stars
Sunday Ill be gone

Dad gave up on you so long ago
Your mother is someone you do not know
You havent money and you still get by
Everything I say makes you cry

Stay with me
Well be closer than the stars
Sunday Ill be gone
Stay with me
You can wear all the colors that you want
Sunday Ill be gone

What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you?
You ask for nothing that you want
Everything

Wanna take another photograph
Say it makes you think of me
If it only took a photograph
I think youd still be here with me

Stay with me
Well be closer than the stars
Sunday Ill be gone
Stay with me
You can wear all the colors that you want
Sunday Ill be gone
Sunday Ill be gone---Lyrics submitted by Holly.
