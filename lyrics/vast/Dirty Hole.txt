I saw the grave stones
I saw nine year old boys
somehow I knew
they hated me
you can live as long as
you want to live
lately all I want is to be
in your hole
sleep without a dream
as cold as it seems
it's my destiny
how many men have been
in your sacred hole
[how many dead men god]
as I spread her thighs
my life flashes
before my eyes
soothing, disturbing
I'm intoxicated with fear
how many men have died?
in your dirty hole
how many men lay dead
from this killing hole---Lyrics submitted by Dariusz.
