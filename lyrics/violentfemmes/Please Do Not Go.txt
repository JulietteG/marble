Tell you man I'm stuck on this lovely girl
Cause to me she mean all the world
But then she like another guy
I fall down dead, she never see the tears I cry

I said please please please do not go
Please please please do not go
Please please please do not go

How long can the days go on (oh oh oh)
When my love is so strong? (oh oh oh)
And I know I cannot tell a lie 
Oh oh oh, I wanna see him go bye, (goodbye)
Bye (goodbye)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye

Now I wonder
I wonder what she would say
Oh if I told her
If I told her that I felt this way
You know it might make her turn, might make her turn
Might make her turn either way
So all I can do is patiently pray, pray
I pray pray pray

I said please please please do not go
Please please please do not go
Please please please do not go

How long can the days go on (oh oh oh)
When my love is so strong? (oh oh oh)
And I know I cannot tell a lie, (lie lie lie lie)
Oh oh oh, I wanna see him go bye (goodbye)
Bye (goodbye)
Bye bye bye bye bye bye

Oh I tell you man I'm stuck, Im stuck
Im stuck on this lovely girl
And you know I could travel
I could travel over the whole world
And you know what shoe does? She turn around,
She turn around and she like another guy
Oh what can I do? I fall down dead.
She never see the tears I cry

Please please please do not go (repeat 1)
Please please please do not go (oh oh) (repeat 1)
Please please please, you hurt me so, (oh oh) (repeat 1)
Please please please, I got something to show you (repeat 1)---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
