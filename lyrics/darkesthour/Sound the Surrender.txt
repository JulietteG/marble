This moment marks the severing of senses
comatose distinctions the
Gathering of flies on a irrational mind
filled with broken conviction

I've seen how lies take form in your eyes
your suspicious ways
Followed a hollow gaze
you fucking left me to rot
but one day you'll
See first hand how I've paid for your biggest mistake

sound the surrender 
embraced in vain
what will you gain from this
what will you lose

secrets hidden behind your back
your silence it serenades deceit
Secrets hidden behind your back
your forever ideal fantasy 

sound the surrender 
embraced in vain
what will you gain from this
what will you lose

This moment marks the severing of senses
comatose distinctions the
Gathering of flies on a irrational mind
filled with broken conviction

sound the surrender
you have gained all you could from this
sound the surrender
But you've lost only one---Lyrics submitted by Pat.
