I'm in denial of existence drifting over to the other side
Of an endless horizon crossed out and driven by desire
Feeding the fire untill

Oh death pull me closer to your, cold embrace
With such grace you keep driving the same stake
Straight through the heart

And i can't stop from always thinking
This is not our time, and not our place
A notorious devotion to the blood of the earth rushing back into your head...
Now we all pay our respects to the oncming fall
Bow before the dead memory of the reoccurred

Of death pull me closer to your, cold embrace
With suck grace you keep driving the same stake
Straight through the heart of us all

And we are the fall, so don't reach out your hands
in this false promised land
over and over and over again with the promise of and end coming closer
Fate is disguise
Its the ultimate lie of life
Yeah fate is disguise
its the ultimate lie---Lyrics submitted by James.
