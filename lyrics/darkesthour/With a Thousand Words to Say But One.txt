And to reflect is to regret
Throwing it all away
And apathy my one way street
It took so much from me
Separated by this divide I created through my fears
And in your tears you tried to show
Blind eyes and tell deaf ears
If we can make it through the landslide standing
We'll lift each other up to see the bliss on the horizon
Been looking in from the outside lately
I've seen who I used to be and it's not me
And we can keep healing
And we can keep holding on

I just want to take you where our time won't waste anymore
Through the mountains on the water we'll stay engulfed in one another
And when I can wake up to see the sunrise in you eyes 
then we'll finally be free and I'll know I've made it home
So lets go out west and bask in the overcast
And walking through the rain we'll see the beauty in life again, life again
And to reflect is to regret
Throwing it all away
And apathy my one way street
It took so much from me
Separated by this divide I created through my fears
And in your tears you tried to show
Blind eyes and tell deaf ears
And we can keep healing
And we can keep holding on---Lyrics submitted by Bryson.
