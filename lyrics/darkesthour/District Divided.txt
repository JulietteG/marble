We are the expatriated our fate cards have played us neighbors displaced us
we've seen that these demographics are targets shot down by the market
I've felt the wrath of the greedy now complete with more hated Monsters
I've seen the needs of a city completely ignored surrounded by vultures
we are the sons and the daughters expecting betrayal neglecting out passions
we know your plans don't include us that's why we've made our own 

I've felt the wrath of the greedy now complete with more hated Monsters
I've seen the needs of a city completely ignored surrounded by vultures 
destroyers of culture

Insatiable their appetite the Gluttons who consumed their way to the top

We are the expatriated our fate cards have played us neighbors displaced us
we've seen that these demographics are targets shot down by the market
I've felt the wrath of the greedy now complete with more hated Monsters
I've seen the needs of a city completely ignored surrounded by vultures 
destroyers of culture---Lyrics submitted by Pat.
