Back as a boy I longed to be
The fellow women loved to see
And have them all consider me
A "Ladiesman"

I dreamed of Jeannie with delight
And Mary moanin' in the night
As I became with all my might
A "Ladiesman"

Developed into a fuller flower
This throbbing thrust of manly power
Consumed my every waking hour
A "Ladiesman"

I felt the urge, that awful itch
It mounted to a fever pitch
I had me girls no matter which
A "Ladiesman"

Ah, but the hottest fever cools
Those who don't face that fact are fools
For like all men time overrules
A "Ladiesman"

What once was warm began to chill
As father time enforced his will
Until I wondered "am I still
"A Ladiesman?" 

At first I tried to hide my loss
Pretending I was still the boss
With girls who'd never come across
A "Ladiesman"

But they moved with too swift a step
I needed patience more than pep
To keep alive my fading rep
A "Ladiesman"

Don't get me wrong now, I not dead
My shoulders hold a damn good head
So joy has not completely fled
A "Ladiesman"

But it can never be the same
The vigor's vanished from my game
For reminiscing, can you blame
A "Ladiesman"?

I look back at the life I've led
What would my powers have got, instead
Had I not shot so much in bed
A "Ladiesman"?

What tricky trade might I have tried
Had I not laid pre-occupied
But then whose ever satisfied
A "Ladiesman"?

The women I laid, frequently
Each in her heart held secretly
That she was really making me
A "Ladiesman"

A woman feels, a man may guess,
That she conceals beneath her dress
A trap in which she can possess
A "Ladiesman"

She throws the bait, she shows the lure
There's no escaping, that's for sure
You're never really free when you're
A "Ladiesman"

Each fellow follows his own star
But take no appetite too far
That's sound advice, in case you are
A "Ladiesman"

But you call all this sour grapes
Devote yourself to willing rapes
And never mind what all escapes
A "Ladiesman"

Oh, you must feel betrayed by age
I'm reading from a later page
You can't hear me at your stage
A "Ladiesman"

Therefore, my boy, enjoy your prime
Until your fateful date with time
When no longer can you claim, "Hey I'm
A Ladiesman"

Hey, there's a beauty, you agree?
Has quite a body, hasn't she?
Well, sock it to her once for me!
A "Ladiesman"---Lyrics submitted by Ron Montgomery.
