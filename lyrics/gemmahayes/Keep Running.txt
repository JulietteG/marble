Three years in miles of sea 
 somehow i carry you with me
 Your in every face I see
 But the city brings sweet relief
 Until you find me

[Chorus]
 I might as well be lost in Hollywood or London town
 Than be lost in you....You..
 I might as well be lost in Noslow or Tokyo soul
 Than be lost in your world....

 Something you said created a storm that triggered a landslide
 And took you form me...
 Fall starts and endless dreams 
 You say your doing okay but your face gives it all away
 Until you find me

[Chorus]

 Where did you go?(2x)
 I turned around and everything changed(7x)

 [Chorus]

 Keep running just keep running into my arms...
 Oh Oh oh...(6x)---Lyrics submitted by Jessica Jones.
