I had this crazy idea
Somehow wed coast to the end
Change lives in every direction tonight
Guess well just begin again

Oh girl, its been a while
Since we met, out there in the cold
Seems so long ago
Its not hard to imagine
The lives we used to have
When the lights were on low.
So now what?

I had this crazy idea
Somehow wed coast to the end
Change lives in every direction tonight
Guess well just begin again
I think you know youre my best friend.

Its sort of an unspoken rule
That things would not turn out the way you planned
You know that I could handle all of that
If I could still take your hand.
Would you still think I am strong
If I admit that I was wrong?
So now what?

I had this crazy idea
Somehow wed coast to the end
Change lives in every direction tonight
Guess well just begin again
I hope you know youre my best friend.

I had this crazy idea
Somehow wed coast to the end
Change lives in every direction tonight

Guess well just begin again
Guess well just begin again
Guess well just begin again
Guess well just begin again
Guess well just begin again
Guess well just begin again
Guess well just begin again---
