There are only two places I could go
One is dark, and it feels so hollow
And it lets me in only to swallow
To much water until i drown, baby

And the other place is calm and sweet
I can almost feel wings beneath my feet
And i don't care if it feels to deep
I like it, I like it

And I know you wanna
Take a chance
And I know you wanna
Understand me and
Let me in

But you, runaway from what you know
And you, runaway from what you don't
I don't wanna wait for you
To change your mind
Don't take the time
Show me your love tonight

There are only two places that I see
One is strong, and the other one feels so weak
And this plan feels so strange to me
But, it's all I see, baby

And i know you wanna
Let it go
And i know you wanna
Flow this love
But you can't

So you, runaway from what you know
And you, runaway from what you don't
I don't wanna wait for you
To change your mind
Don't take the time
Show me your love tonight, oh yeah, tonight.

All the angels know what i know
You're an angel that sings to me
It's the greatest secret of all
I am free from thinking

But you, runaway from what you know
And you, runaway from what you don't
I don't wanna wait for you
To change your mind
Don't take the time
Let's make love
Don't runaway from what you know
Don't runaway, just let it go
I don't wanna wait for you
To tell me what's right
Don't fight it
Let's make love tonight
Oh yeah, tonight, oh yeah, oh yeah, baby, oh yeah,
Let's make love tonight---Lyrics submitted by BiiiTcH*.
