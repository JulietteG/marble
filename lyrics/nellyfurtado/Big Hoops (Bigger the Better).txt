Tonight is the jam
I'll be there till dawn
I'm going down, I've got my big hoops on
Pant leg so wide, I've got my backpack on
I'm gonna hear my favorite song

Hey hey hey, what's the scenario
The boy keeps passin' my by
I said no diggity, no doubt
I thought I told you I was fly
Yeah he and all of his friends they
They got that hair like high five

I dont wanna talk about sex
Wanna express myself tonight

I can go fast, I can go slow
I can go places nobody else goes
I can move fast, I can move slow
I can go places nobody else goes

Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day

I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never seen something like that

That boy gonna feel my poison
I know it can stay in the rain
Like you wanna be down with your baby
Back and forth, back and forth
Back, back, back and forth
You got my rum rum shaking them another back
When you should not real
And I never have to fake it fake it
You know I oughta move quick
And I gotta move slow
Cause there ain't no wind in the road

I can go fast, I can go slow
I can go places nobody else goes
I can move fast, I can move slow
I can go places nobody else goes

Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day Everybody say hey, they goin' at it all night and day

I betcha never seen something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never heard something like that like that like that like that
I betcha never seen something like that

I betcha never seen something like that
I betcha never heard something like that

Oh I thought this song was over
No, it ain't over yet

I can go fast, I can go fast
I can go fast

The bigger the better
The bigger the better
The bigger the better
The better the bigger

I can go fast

The bigger the better
The bigger the better
The bigger the better
