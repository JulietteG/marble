Its a Breeze               

Drop your worries, pick up on this fine
Stream of love were riding on
Dont believe those silly rumors life is a chore
Im tellin ya, just
5, 4, 3, 2  count it down with me
Well blast off and next youll see
Whats behind us shrink and disappear out of view

(CHORUS)
Come on, lets
Breeze, breeze down this highway
Speed up this ride now
No trials too strong
To drag us down well
Breeze, breeze down this highway
Weve got more inside us
This life isnt done
We got it, its a breeze

(verse 2)
Windows down, were flying by
And this fresh air smells like paradise
And weve got our destination right, were all clear
So now just
Sing with me, now dont be shy
We got great tunes on, and turned up high
 and our hearts stocked full with all supplies we could need
come on, lets
(Repeat chorus)

(bridge)
Right now, in this moment
I feel something growing
Strong good vibes are flowing out all around
This, here, now and after
Lets keep up the laughter
Lets relive this chapter time and again..

 (repeat chorus)
