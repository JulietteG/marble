Let It Fall

A hopeless shade of blue
Just like the rain outside
Im overdue
For Gods sweet reply

Drowning in this brew
Of all these aching, aching feelings of mine
Im pulled out to
The streaming divine  

(Chorus)
Sprinkling down with the rain
My souls reclaimed
Im healed in awe
Let it fall
Let it fall

(Verse 2)
Oozing out my pain
Cool water surging through my soul
Easing the strain
Thats taken a toll

I breathe in a change
Those demons never, never coming back   
I feel ordained
As rain runs down my neck

(repeat chorus)

(bridge)
From here forward I feel powerful
Come whatever will
I own each day, I'll make my way
Now Ill be fulfilled

(repeat chorus)
