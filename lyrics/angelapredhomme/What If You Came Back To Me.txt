What If You Came Back to Me

 (verse 1)
You strolled right in on page 23 of my book about love and 
things I wish could be and fresh flowers bloomed in 
sequence as we walked by
I fell so hard and it went so fast, I guess whirlwind 
things sometimes dont last
and I found myself, wishing we would have tried
And Im wondering here tonight

(chorus)
What if you came back to me
Just wipe the past and
join me in my fairy tale
What if we could instantly
Forget the reasons were apart.

(verse 2) 
A big loud boom through my sugar-sweet world
when we came crashin down, it was all I heard
I stood strong but I, was curled up and crying inside
You rule my mind with your ripped up jeans and you own my 
soul with that smile that beams
now this time around, Im bettin it just might fly
And Im wondering here tonight

(repeat chorus)

(bridge)
I remember dancing close
and how you melted me
I relive each tender touch
Now this just shouldnt be and I miss you
Oh, I miss you.. I love you still
Ahhhhhhhhhhh    

(chorus)
What if you came back to me
Just wipe the past and
join me in my fairy tale
What if we could instantly
Forget the reasons were apart.

(chorus 2)
Just come on back to me
Well leave the past and
start a little fairy tale
I know that well instantly
Forget the reasons we were apart.
