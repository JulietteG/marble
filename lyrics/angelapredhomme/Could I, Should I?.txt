Could I, Should I?

Would you hold your umbrella in the rain for me?
Would you show me good old-fashioned chivalry?
I might get swept up just like an ingnue
But could I, should I with you?

If I kept you waiting there till half past eight
Would you smile and tell me still that I look great?
A guy like that could make me come unglued
But could I, should I, with you?

(Bridge)
Night falls, youre on my mind, as expected
My thoughts spin counterclockwise back to the time
You first caught my eye

Are you strong enough to always do whats right
Make me feel secure and let the small things slide
A guy like that might be a wise pursuit
But could I, should I, with you?

(Repeat Bridge)

Would you hold your umbrella in the rain for me?
Would you show me good old-fashioned chivalry?
I might get swept up just like an ingnue
But could I, should I with you?
