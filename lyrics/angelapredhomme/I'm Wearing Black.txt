Heat wave swelters on
Night cats start their prowl
Im doing up my hair
Cant wait to get there
Cause Im ready now
To feel your full-on power next to me

(Chorus)
Im wearing black and Im ready to see
If you can crack my little coy mystery
Cause where I want you to be tonight 
Is cozy and close to me 

Shoulder straps so thin
Hair falls on my skin
Little make-up on
Its only you I want
Cause Im ready now
To let your full-on power conquer me

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge)
Jazz beat driving
Coinciding with my heart racing for you
Time is flying
Swirling by, 
My world is down to just us two

(Instrumental verse)
(repeat chorus 2x)
