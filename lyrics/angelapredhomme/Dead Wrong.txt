Dead Wrong    

(Verse 1)
You shoot your words out recklessly 
taking sloppy aim at me
And now I got you blacklisted
Ill stay just beyond your reach
Your ways, they just aint right and
If you think Ill let it slide

(Chorus)
Youre dead wrong
Youre dead wrong 
If you think that just rolls off
Youre dead wrong
Youre dead wrong
Now, youre gonna see my claws
Youre dead wrong

(Verse 2)
Ive always been a spiritual girl
a Jesus wanna-be
Forgiveness sounds endearing 
But youd just walk all over me
You might think Im sweet as pie but
If you think Ill let it slide

(repeat chorus)

(Bridge)
Truth is I feel for you
Love is clear through the roof
Teeming with sunshine most days
Please take care, no more blood
All thats here, dont mess up
Youll see Im worth your hardest try

(Instr. section)

(Verse 3)
I let you know straight up how I feel
My best diplomacy
But then you snap back nasty and mean
My side you just dont see
Youre full of all that pride and
When you wont apologize

(Chorus)
Youre dead wrong
Youre dead wrong 
That stuff dont just roll off
Youre dead wrong
Youre dead wrong
If you think Im gonna take that for long
Youre dead wrong
