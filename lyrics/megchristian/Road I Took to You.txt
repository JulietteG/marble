Bread and Water 
Like some poor man's daughter
No never fathered me

Wine and Money called me honey
and made me feel I was real

Like a glass raised too many times
I broke in two.

I was walking around in little pieces
and I never even knew that the way back home to me
was the road I took to you.

Winter saw me down and dragging my feet
through the snow
Drinking feeling like I was living on the street 
with no place to go.

And cracked in the cod
I felt the cold come through.

I was walking around in little pieces
and I never even knew that the way back home to me
was the road I took to you.

Now and Now I have ended up with a cup so full.
That overflowing all the time  knowing it is nothing i can hold in my hand.

And it feels so good to me
Being here with you

I was walking around in little pieces
and I never even knew that the way back home to me
was the road I took to you.

 that the way back home to me
was the road I took to you.---Lyrics submitted by RGrace Rodrigue.
