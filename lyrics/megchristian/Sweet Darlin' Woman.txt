Sweet darlin' woman
Now that the past is left behind
Won't you try to see my state of mind.
Loving you.
I still can remember you.

Sweet Darlin' woman
Do you still run away?
Even though you 
I spend loving you
What else can I do

Sweet Darlin' woman
Please don't take my heart so carelessly
Just say the words and I'll be
By your side

Oh Sweet Darlin' woman
We are here to stay
Satisfied

You know I need your touch
to let you feel how much
I am your

Sweet Darlin' woman
Do you still run away.
Even though 
I spend loving you
Sweet Darling Woman
Even though you may 

I will be here
Sweet Darling Woman
You may disappear
I will be here.---Lyrics submitted by RGrace Rodrigue.
