A Wooden Soldier, 
And a Doll of Clay~
     Were brought together
     In the Art Display.
Then someone took them~~
Stood them apart.

And the Wooden Soldier
Lost the battle for her heart.

    There came the day to retreat
     To the border of heartbreak.

Down came the stars~~
He lost his war~~
His world began to shake.

     And though they both were
     A work of art~~
     The Wooden Soldier lost the battle
     for her heart.

Music~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Wooden Soldier
And the Doll of Clay~~
     Are like two people
     I know today.

You are my Dolly~~
And we're apart.
     And all because I lost the battle
     For your heart.

And though I had to retreat
To the border of heartbreak~~
     It's no disgrace to have to pace
     The hurt a love can make.

It's not too late now for a new start~~
This Wooden Soldiers' gonna battle
For your heart!---Lyrics submitted by Kathy.
