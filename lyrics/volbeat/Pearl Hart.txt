Lady Pearl in jail
Lady Pearl in jail
you'll rise
Lady Pearl in jail
Lady Pearl in jail
you'll fight

A letter from her mother now dying in her bed
get on home quickly with the medicine
no money in her pocket no wheels to go ahead
she grabbed her colt 44 and

Went along the mountain side
mama love I'm on my way don't you cry
I'll make it just in time
mama love I'm on my way don't you cry
please hold on

The young lady Pearl was dressed
in a man's jeans and a shirt
a stage coach was stopped
and robbed were three passengers
gave each of them a dollar
enough for them to eat
then she disappeared down south and

Went along the mountain side
mama love I'm on my way don't you cry
I'll make it just in time
mama love I'm on my way don't you cry

Lady Pearl in jail lady Pearl in jail
you'll rise
Lady Pearl in jail lady Pearl in jail
you'll fight ---Lyrics submitted by Bo Davis.
