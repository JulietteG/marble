Fire Song (Danny and Lucy Revisited)
Well, I can dance to the morning light
With my feet on fire
Drive the devil motherfucker
With my babe holding on for miles
Well hey, do you really think
The truth is up there
Oh baby, let me tell you something
I don't care

Our masterplan has been waiting
And have been ready for far too long
Unleash the multiple devil songs
That grows inside your tongue
I've been wasting some time
Just to be part of shit
Now's the time, unleash the chain
'cause hell awaits my name

To play in hell, we'll seek no other game
You too are there, well hell-o we meet again

Well baby let's take a break
And walk up to the hills
The church of god are waiting us
But they do not know
That we bring all the fire songs
To burn their tongues
Oh baby baby see the house of god blow up

Our masterplan has been waiting
And have been ready for far too long
Unleash the multiple devil songs
That grows inside your tongue
I've been wasting some time
Just to be part of shit
Now's the time, unleash the chain
'cause hell awaits my name

To play in hell, we'll seek no other game
You too are there, well hell-o we meet again
Remember when we took it all
And danced the night away
Well hell-o we meet again
