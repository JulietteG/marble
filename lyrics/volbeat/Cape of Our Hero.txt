Out of the perfection nothing will and can be made
the old skin has to shed before the new one sees the day
opportunities to find the deeper powers in ourselves
come when life is breathing and seems more than what it is

Go blindly completely!

You tell me how I can fly away
and believe that all the angels are coming
you bring me down then I will fly again
and believe that all the angels are coming!

The kingdom of the fathers and the heroes where are you
Im talking to you every night more than I should do
what awaits and when will be the day
when I can wear the cape

Im lying on the ground as always staring to the air

Go blindly completely!

You tell me how I can fly away
and believe that all the angels are coming
you bring me down then I will fly again
and believe that all the angels are coming! Zah, ah, ah!

(Breakdown)

The stars are long gone but we can still see their glow
long after theyve skidded off into oblivion!


You tell me how... I can fly away...
and believe that all of the angels are coming
you bring me down, then I will fly again
and believe that all of the angels coming!

You tell me how, I can fly away
and believe that all of the angels are coming
you bring me down, then I will fly again
and believe that all of the angels are coming!

You tell me how, I can fly away 
And believe the beginnings are coming 
You bring me down, then I will fly again 
And believe the beginnings are coming---Lyrics submitted by Anders Petersen.
