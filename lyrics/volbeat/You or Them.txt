A place in the fire angels of hell
The boss is waiting my knock
His body is lying, a second to come
And he knew, I'm the one

God's angel's eyes are now watching my back
Saying that god can forgive me
I rather walk the dirt and feel the heat
Forever banded, and pulverizing your door step

I welcome you angels and devils on earth, to have a look a my soul
Well what you seeking is under control
Memphis calling me home
God's angel's eyes are now watching my back
Saying god can forgive me
I rather walk the dirt and feel the heat
Forever banded, and pulverizing your door step

Dear angels, dear Satan you're losing this game again
Presley has taken me home
Dear angels, dear Satan you're losing this game again
Presley has taken me home

Seeking the truth for yourself and behold all the pride and honor
Justice, whatever they call it a poem
Do it all on your own
God's angel's eyes are now watching my back
Saying god can forgive me
I rather walk the dirt and feel the heat
Forever banded, and pulverizing your door step

Dear angels, dear Satan you're losing this game again
Presley has taken me home
Dear angels, dear Satan you're losing this game again
Presley has taken me home---Lyrics submitted by Sandra.
