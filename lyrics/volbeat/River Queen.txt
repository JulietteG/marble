Saw an angel been nailed to the cross
Down the dim river side
A woman cry be with me into the end of the light

Born a river queen to grace for land and hope
Laying on silver stones
To give to the poor
But gods men came to land and took it all

Starlight mystic now paint the sky
Starlight mystic now lift her spirit high
(in) memories of a queen who was giving her love
Down the rivers end

What a vision and why the hell am I getting this
Her beauty is changing my mind
I promise you woman to tell them the story of thine

Truth or fairytale a raggle taggle crowe screaming:
Humanity was losing all senses in life when religion came in---Lyrics submitted by Michel Lathrop.
