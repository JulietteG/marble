Feel the fire where she walks
Lola Montez so beautiful
shady and a tempered dame
blinding your eyes with her spider dance

Her performance utterly erotic subversive to all ideas
and for public morality
and cool as she was she didnt care
see the miner throw his gold
lifting her skirt howling loud like a wolf
hell raising and full of sin
when Lola was dancing and showing her skin

Wherever she walks
she will be captivating all the men
dont look in her eyes
you might fall and find the love of your life heavenly
but shell catch you in her web
the love of your life

Well notorious I have been
but never for fame thats what she said
dear Henry taste my whip
never to see any words you print

Oh Lola Im sure that the love would have been
the key to all your pain
no words will later come
did the spider bite your tongue
we will surely not forget the Lola spider dance---Lyrics submitted by Bo Davis.
