Saturday I love you like gold
Not like the Monday, you pass like a ghost
The fire killed you like a motherless child
I saw you last Sunday at Barbara Hotel... 
Oh oh oh oh oh- oh babe I'm so sorry, I know where to go... 

Could scream like a pig, Could bark like a dog
Just to get attention as I'm chasing you down the hall
Oh Maybelenne you've been so lonely
Got a fire burning as I'm smoking you out again... 
Still all the leaves will keep on falling
Until I see you dancing on the table 45 again
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/volbeat/maybellene_i_hofteholder.html ]
(I) see you dancing for the young ones oh oh oh
Maybellene I Hofteholder
Could you be the only one
Well I beg you to come home
Dance forever my only one

Could scream like a pig, Could bark like a dog
Just to get attention as I'm chasing you down the hall
Oh Maybellene you've been so lonely
Got a fire burning as I'm smoking you out again... 

(I) see you dancing for the young ones oh oh oh
Maybellene I Hofteholder
(I) see you dancing for the young ones oh oh oh
Maybellene I Hofteholder
Could you be the only one
Well I beg you to come home
Dance forever my only one

I flicked the switch at Monday night
Oh Maybellene I'm so sorry that I didn't see it coming.
And now the sky, I filled with prayers.
Oh baby I'm sorry I was blind---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
