Time keeps painting my darling
Ripped all the flowers in the garden
Oh baby come home, you angels bring her home

Imens str solen over hjen
Han mindes den sommer hvor hun strlede
Forsvandt I haven grn, og trernes sang hun fandt

Time keeps painting my darling
And the garden keeps on singing the old song
Oh baby still I am waiting in the light
Hoping the angels would carry you home

Den sang tog mrket I sin pote
Den bar hans kvinde I dens kolde favn
Og lagde hende for hans dr I silkekjole

Hoping the angels would carry her home
Leaving it all with my only friend
Her beauty was lifeless on the stair
Oh baby I'll carry you away into the garden's tale
But everything (had) died and turned to stones
I laid her down under the old oak
Seeing it all blossom forever more
Time keeps on painting my darling
And the garden keeps on singing the old song
Oh baby now I know you're in the light
Painting it all with your colorful songs

Imens str solen over hjen
Hans skygge kastes ud I haven grn
Forsvandt for evigt og uden en note
Hoping the angels will carry her home

Time keeps painting my darling
Ripped all the flowers in the garden
Oh baby you're home, you angels where are you.---Lyrics submitted by Dessan.
