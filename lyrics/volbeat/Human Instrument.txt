See the titie klitie hootie boogie woogie girl
Distraction no sex, her looks kills more then guns
Deceiving, believing the web she spins on you
Addicted, pathetic, predicted

For a while or for a day we chase the dark away
Feel the morning (whispers) though a sunny day
I promise to take you back into the vault below
I'll rise you from the underworld

See the titie klitie hootie boogie woogie wicked girl
The sign of a pretty prickly ladies walking around with wicked souls
Chasing their eyes when they bleed again, oh baby girl oh baby gail
Chasing the life and let it roll

Black December leave the earth and let us feel the morning fire
The taping fingers on my shoulder make my demons scream and lie
Chasing their eyes when they bleed again, oh baby girl oh baby gail
Feeling their eyes and let them roll
Chasing a life and live it

Feeling the moment when they cry
My body is sentenced to see where they go
Still they are crying, and deny 
That mother earth has send them to shores far beyond

Are we all the wonder of a life that we can call our own
Oh baby baby still the guiding and the taping leaves us cold

Chasing their eyes when they bleed again, oh baby girl oh baby gail
Feeling their eyes and let them roll
Chasing a life and live it

Feeling the moment when they cry
My body is sentenced to see where they go
Still they are crying, and deny
That mother earth has send them to shores far beyond---Lyrics submitted by Beate.
