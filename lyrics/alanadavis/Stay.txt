Ive been on the search for love to come
How will it find me?
I looked at the reasons I begun
They dont remind me
I give myself over every time
Im looking forward
But it always ends up that Im the one
Going nowhere

So, Ill wait undercover 
for another day
And dream of a lover 
whose love for me will stay

I look at the other hearts I know
Theyre always broken
They chalk it up to experience,
Calling it progress
Well Ive grown indifferent to the game
Its all a program

When winning and losing feel the same
Why am I hoping?

Love has a cover
Theres a price you pay
Ill wait another whole life for love
That can stay

I know youre out there
Will you wait for me?
I know youre out there
Will stay with me?

Ill wait undercover 
for another day
And dream of a lover 
whose love for me will stay

When I lock the door and settle in
My conscious warns me
It always seems like loneliness
Just becomes me

Well I promise you eternity
You can always trust me
Until you call for me to stay
Where I dont wanna be
So, Ill wait undercover 
for another day
And dream of this lover 
who knows my pain

I will wait for another
Whole life, for the day
Ill wait for a love
I will wait for a love
To stay

Wait for me---Lyrics submitted by Wendy Bordas.
