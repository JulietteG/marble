Somebody bring me a flower, Im a robot 
Somebody bring me a flower, Im a robot 
Im all metal and plastic, wires and elastic
Somebody bring me a flower, Im a robot 

VERSE 1: 
Now Jesus Christ he told the robots to play some music 
The Robots played their music with a stick, stick, stick 
Robots sang about how Jesus gone so long 
All the other robots loved that song. 

CHORUS 

BRIDGE: 
Im a robot, I'm not a power ranger 
Im a robot, feel like a coat hanger 
Im a robot, I'm not a country singer 
Im a robot...  two, three, four

CHORUS 

Album Buttermilk & Rifles - Artist Kev Russell's Junker---Lyrics submitted by Peg Baldwin.
