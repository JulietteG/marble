I met the joker and I stole the moon
I raise the sunshine and I have been the fool
And I have been laughed at and I have been lied to
And I have been left alone and nowhere since

I don't cry, I don't cry no more. Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more. Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more. Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more

I took the picture and I faced the truth
I lived a lifetime, a lifetime with you
Now I watch you fall asleep smiling while I lie awake
But there's only so much the woman can take

Ooo I don't cry, I don't cry no more. Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more. Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more. Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more
Ooooooo, Ooooooo

And I am a hero I'm not made of steel
And I'm not the smartest man
But I know the deal and I'll bleed for your lips if you'll bleed for mine
And I can't escape it cause I do love you

Ooh I don't cry, I don't cry no more. Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more. Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more. Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more
Oooooo Ooooooo

Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this. So I don't cry no more---Lyrics submitted by Jacob.
