I want to use my hands on your body
I want to explore your rivers and your valleys. 
From the top of your mountains to the depths of your sea, 
I want to fuel the fire inside of me. 

I'm your lover man, digging as deep as I can. 
I'm your lover man and I travel, I travel. 
I'm your lover man, going as far as I can. 
I'm your lover man and I travel, I travel. 

I want to look in your eyes past the mask you hide behind. 
I want to know all of you; what makes you smile, what makes you blue. 
You know I want to please you, take you so high. 
Forget that you can't fly. We're just spaceships in the night. 

Ripping your clothes off of the past 
Making a new path and a brand new day 
Baby come with me I'll take you away 

I'm your lover man, digging as deep as I can. 
I'm your lover man and I travel, I travel. 
I'm your lover man, going as far as I can. 
I'm your lover man and I travel, I travel. 

Je t'aime mi amor, Je t'aime mi amor 
Je t'aime mi amor, Je t'aime mi amor 
from the garden in Versailles, to the desert in Dubai, 
from the top of the Great Wall, we can touch the sky. 

I'm your lover man, digging as deep as I can. 
I'm your lover man and I travel, I travel. 
I'm your lover man, going as far as I can. 
I'm your lover man and I travel, I travel.

I'm your lover man, digging as deep as I can. 
I'm your lover man and I travel, I travel. 
I'm your lover man, going as far as I can. 
I'm your lover man and I travel, I travel. *2---Lyrics submitted by Jacob.
