[Intro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey yeah

[Verse 1]
Stressed out uptight, over worked wound up
Unleash what you got let's explore your naughty side
Follow me where we go, we don't need no bread crumbs
Cant you see baby you're the only one
You are my love, you are my love
Let me be your medicine
Cuz I got one thing on my mind I'll be your valentine
Spread your wings and baby fly away

[Chorus]
It's your body you can yell if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you lay right here girl don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy
It's your body we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you lay right here I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ooooo

[Verse 2]
Baby less all for you to do is let your body be
I'll lick you down and make you feel like you 'bout it 'bout it
Ha ha ha ha ha ha, the doctor's here for you
Take you like Twilight I'll bite your neck
You don't have to stay in the rain I'll get you wet, yeah
Push you up against the wall ,turn you out and turn you on
Eh eh whoa

[Chorus]
It's your body you can yell if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you lay right here girl don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy
It's your body we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you lay right here I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa oooo
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa oooo

[Bridge]
Whoa-oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Girl it's your body we can do whatever you like
Girl it's your body we can do whatever you like
It's your body we can ride and rock and roll
Ride and rock and roll,ride and rock
O-o-o-OH oh oh oh

[Chorus]
It's your body you can yell if you want to
Loud if you want to, scream if you want to
Just let me love you lay right here girl don't be scared of me
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy
It's your body we'll go hard if you want to
As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you lay right here I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy
Girl it's girl it's girl it's your body
We can do, can do, (sex therapy) can do
Girl it's girl it's girl it's your body
We can do whatever (sex therapy) you like
Just let me love you lay right here girl don't be scared of me
