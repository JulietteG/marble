Baby Beverly Hills Hotel 4am
Its my birthday
I wanna stay young
I wanna have fun
I dont wanna be the only one no way
Movie stars models and blondes and cocaine
New York LA its all the same
The angels look the other way
Cause they can understand my pain

Cocaine back up in a big way
Cocaine comin out the closets
Cocaine Im standin in an alley
With my hands behind me
The club just aint the same without the cocaine

Ooh downtown upstairs get down
Midnight high art underground
Hip hop blue jeans its all around
I wanna stay young ooh
Everybodys watchin but no one talks about it
Right now theres only one name u cant call it
She said sex just aint the same without it Its cocaine
Cocaine back up in a big way
Cocaine comin out the closets
Cocaine Im standin in an alley
With my hands behind me
The club just aint the same without the cocaine
