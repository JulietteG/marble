She's so hard on my love. She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love. She's so hard on my love

Her name was Jessica I met her in the bathroom
It was on it was off it was good it was bad, yea
I took her to the movie had a little popcorn
And I guess when I looked at her skirt, just cause

She's so hard on my love. She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love. She's so hard on my love
All you got do to is lay with me, baby stay with me, baby.
All you got to do is lay me with me, baby stay with me, baby

Six months later ain't nothing new going on here
I ain't kissed on no lips since the last time you heard from me

You're so hard on my love. You're so hard on my love
youre so hard on my love. You're so hard on my love
All you got do to is lay with me, baby stay with me, baby.
All you got to do is lay me with me, baby stay with me, baby

Oh! I don't wanna lose you but I don't wanna get lost
It'd be easy to see eye to eye
if you'd come down off of your high horse

All you got do to is lay with me, baby stay with me, baby.
All you got to do is lay me with me, baby stay with me, baby
Oh! She's so hard on my love. She's so hard on my love.
She's so hard on my love. She's so hard on my love---Lyrics submitted by Jacob.
