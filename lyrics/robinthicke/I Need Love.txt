Settle down love, For a minute
I wanna take U by the hand and Hold U
I've waited so many nights
To see U
And I wanna take out all my problems 
On U

[Chorus]
I can do better than make love to U
Better than make U say my name
Please, Please, Please
Oh don't U make me have to beg
I need Love Love Love Love Love
I need Love Love Love Love Love

Angel wont you slow it down
Seems like you're always packing and unpacking again
And I know that the hardest thing
Is to please U
You would bring most men to their knees

[Chorus]

Please, Please, Please (x2)

I need Love Love Love
I need Love---Lyrics submitted by Shenieka.
