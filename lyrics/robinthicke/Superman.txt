I'm a superman thanks to Lois Lane
Kissed away my problems when I went insane
Fished me from the bottom when I lost my name
Gave me something I could live for
(Something I could live for)

And everybody wonders what's the change
They don't recognize me 'cause I got so much to say
And I never thought that anyone could love someone
So much that they give up on everything

I will be there to take care of you
I will be there when you cry, babe
I will be there when you need someone
To tell you that you're beautiful, baby

I will be there when you need someone to run with
I will be there when you need someone to dance with
I'm your lover when the skies turn gray
Everyday til it's beautiful, baby

Oh, 'til it's beautiful
'Til it's beau, ooh, ooh, baby
'Til it's beautiful, baby

I'm a butterfly when I'm in your hands
You can turn the pavement into white sand
You can make a moment a memory in a glance
And I can't believe anyone else and everybody's talking

But you always keep shouting
You never stop cursing, yeah, babe
And I never thought that anyone could love someone
So much that they give up on everything

I will be there to take care of you
I will be there when you cry, babe
I will be there when you need someone
To tell you that you're beautiful, baby

I will be there when you need someone to run with
I will be there when you need someone to dance with
I'm your lover when the skies turn gray
Everyday 'til it's beautiful, baby

I'm your superman, baby, yeah
Your superman, baby, ooh

'Til it's beautiful
'Til it's beautiful
'Til it's beautiful, baby
Your superman, babe

'Til it's beautiful
'Til it's beau, ooh, ooh, baby
'Til it's beautiful, baby

There's a million people underneath the sun
That can find a million more and never find the one
There's a girl who did this and a socialite
Was on magazines and was the shy type, baby

But I'm a superman thanks to Lois Lane
Kissed away the problems when I went insane
Fished me from the bottom when I lost my name
And I never thought anyone could ever mean so much, so much

I will be there to take care of you
I will be there when you cry, babe
I will be there when you need someone
To tell you that you're beautiful, baby

I will be there when you need someone to run with
I will be there when you need someone to dance with
I'm your lover when the skies turn gray
Everyday 'til it's beautiful, baby

'Til it's beautiful
'Til it's beautiful
'Til it's beautiful, baby
Your superman babe

'Til it's beautiful
'Til it's beautiful
'Til it's beautiful, baby ---Lyrics submitted by Berit Moen.
