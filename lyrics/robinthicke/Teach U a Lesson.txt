U feel so good,
U smell so good, 
U feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
I can't let U go, I can't let U go, 
I can't let U go

[Chorus]
U were late to school
Im gonna have 2, see you after class
U've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have 2, Teach U a lesson
U've been a bad girl
Someones gonna have 2, Straighten U right out
U've been a bad girl
Somenones gonna have 2 Teach U

Teach U, Teach U, Teach U (x2)

Someones gonna have 2 Teach U
Teach U, Teach U, Teach U

U can call me professor
But baby, U broke the rules
U wont get the grades U want
Unless U stay after school
U can work it off (work it off, work it off)
Baby I can give extra credit (extra credit)
But there's something else

Girl can I frisk U
Search your body 4
You look so guilty 2 me
If I make U nervous
Its cause you're hiding, WMDs
And Im gonna sentence U
Baby U can do ur Time on me
I can't let U go, I can't let U go

[Chorus]

Just 4 the moment, 4 tonite
Can I, Make you mine
Is it me
Is it us
Can I love more (more, more, ooh)


Oooo-oh, Aaaaa-ah
