oooohhh 
oh babe 
oohh 

Why do people smile when no ones smiling? 
Its coz their thinking of someone theyre loving 
Keep on believing we are meant to me and 
Nothings stopping you and me from going to heaven 
Sweetest love 

I got the sweetest love there aint nothing sweeter 
I got the sweetest love aint nothing beat it 
There aint nothing sweeter 

Now we're clever is about to inch just one ladder 
It gets better every second were together 
Oooh baby it feels so right 
A new beginning starts tonight 
The reason for when its on 
Is because of you and me and 
Sweetest love 

Finally I cant believe 
Coz you and me, youre my sweetest love 

I got the sweetest love there aint nothing sweeter 
I got the sweetest love aint nothing beat it 
There aint nothing sweeter 

Come on now, I got the sweetest love there aint nothing sweeter 
I got the sweetest love cant nothing beat it 
There aint nothing sweeter oh yeah 

Now I got that feeling in my gut 
Now I need your fire in my life 
Now I wanna give you love so much 
And I keep on feeling my sweet, my sweet 
Sweetest love 

I cant believe that you and me, we gotta be 
Youre my sweetest love 

I got the sweetest love there aint nothing sweeter 
I got the sweetest love cant nothing beat it 
There aint nothing sweeter 

Come on now, I got the sweeter love there aint nothing sweeter 
I got the sweetest love cant nothing beat it 
There aint nothing sweeter ooohh 

I got the sweetest love there aint nothing sweeter 
I got the sweetest love cant nothing beat it 
There aint nothing sweeter ooohh 

I got the sweetest love aint nothing be sweeter 
I got the sweetest love cant nothing beat it 
There aint nothing sweeter 

Sweetest love 
I cant believe, you and me, we gotta be 
Oh my sweetest love---Lyrics submitted by Shelley.
