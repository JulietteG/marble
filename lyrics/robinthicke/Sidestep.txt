Ohhhh Baby. Come on baby, come on now
Sidestep. Hey, Don't you sidestep my love Huh

They say it ain't about your car and your house
Or the money you make and how it all goes down
I think that it's about keeping ones you love near
That's why I'm on the high thinking you should be here
Maybe I should hurry up get by your side
Follow you around just be on your time. Or maybe I should just leave you behind
Maybe I'm keeping you from a chance at a better life

Oh then I call you and I come out and tell you straight up
Baby I, I need your love

And you go sidestep, Pull me around
Put out your hand, Put me on down
And I wanna know why, why you don't need my love
Then you go sidestep, Swing me around
Put out your hand, Put me on down
And I wanna know why, why you ain't in any hurry for my love

Oh Hmmm. You ain't in no hurry
Baby that makes me worry on the telephone telling me tired of being alone
But we staying up all night talking about I ain't doing right
Baby come on oh and when I open up and straight up tell you
Baby a man needs love too

then you go sidestep spin me around
Put out your hand Put me on down
And I wonder why you ain't in no hurry for my love.
Come on now. Oh hey baby
Sidestep hey; come on baby come on now
Hey Sidestep Hey
dont you sidestep my love. Come on baby uh

I drop everything and cancel my plans, uh
And I come to you hat in my hand
Hoping we can find a new way to understand babe
And maybe we can be a better woman and man
Come on now

Oh I need you cause you're my best friend
But I can't believe it, here we go again

When you go sidestep. Pull me around
Put out your hand Put me on down
And I, Wanna know why, why you don't need my love
Then you go sidestep. Swing me around
Put out your hand. Put me on down
And I wanna know why, why you don't need my love
Ooohh. Sidestep. Swing it around, 
Put out your hand. Put me on down
And I wonder why you ain't in no hurry for my love

Come on baby yeah all right. Oh sidestep huh
   Come on baby. Come on now. Sidestep hey
Swing it around. Pull it on down
Come on. Don't you sidestep my love

Come on baby sidestep. Hey Sidestep my love
Pull me around, Open your heart baby
Don't you sidestep me. Sidestep my love
Come on now come on baby
