Oooh, awww babe, awww
You're my baby, my baby, you're my sweet, sweet child,
You're my only love

You're like a baby jumping up and down
Ooh like a baby I can't put you down
And when you cry I'll pacify you
Here in my arms you're safe and warm

You're my baby, Ooh baby (ooh baby)

You're my sweet, sweet child
You're my only love (you're my only love)

You're part of me and I'm part of you
You're living proof of my dream come true
Here in my walls I will protect you.
I'll tell you straight up re-educate you in love
You can trust me. You can be all you want in front of me
You can pout. You can smile. You don't have to be perfect cause you're perfect the way that you are

You're my baby, Ooh baby (ooh baby)
You're my sweet, sweet child
You're my only love (you're my only love)
You're my baby, Ooh baby (ooh baby)
You're my sweet, sweet child
