The stars are aligning
The future is bright
When I thought Id never make it through girl
You got me right
Every time I see you walking by
I just want to chase you round the club
Just like it was the first time
I still get so excited baby
I just need a taste

Whenever Im feeling low
Whenever I cant let go
Whenever I want to party
You put your lovin' on me
Whenever Im feelin' crazy
Whenever the world is hating
Whenever Im hurting baby
You put your lovin' on me

Thats all I wanna do
Put your lovin' on
Thats all I need from you
Put your lovin' on me
Thats all I wanna do
Put your lovin' on
Put your lovin' on
Put your lovin' on me

Dangerous body
Dangerous face
Dangerous cause everybody wants some
I cant give her no space

Take it off
Put it on me
Do what you want
Be what you want to be
Its on you
Set it free
Do what you want
Tell me what you want to see ---
