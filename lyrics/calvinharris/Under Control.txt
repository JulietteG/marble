I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold, you know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting to the fire to enlight
Feeling like we could do right
We're the one that makes the night
This fear is a lonely road
We're under control

We're under control

I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold, you know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting to the fire to enlight
Feeling like we could do right
We're the one that makes the night
This fear is a lonely road
We're under control

Waiting to the fire to enlight
Feeling like we could do right
We're the one that makes the night
This fear is a lonely road
We're under control---
