Everybody's hurting, Everybody's knows it.
Are you tryin to stop it?, Everyone's watchin.
What are you goin to do?
Are you tryin to stop it?, Everyone's watchin.
Everyone is conversin, Everyone's listenin.

Oh yeah, They were a part, 
He was a part, She was a part of it.
Oh, fallin apart.
Is anyone watchin? Is anyone listenin?
Are we listenin?

And all I have is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill.
Over you, Over me, Over this.

Oh they never knew, They never knew,
What you're goin through.
Cause you got everybody thinkin there's nothing wrong with you.
And you felt apart, Cause they were a part of it.
Oh, Falling apart.
Is anyone watchin? Is anyone listenin?
Are you listening?

And all I have is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill.
Over you, Over me, Over this.

Dark and stormy days, Somewhere it's glowin.
And even though I know I'm here.
I know I'm goin, Oh you never stop, You just collide.
Collapse onto you're side.
So rise and make it right.
Yeaaa-eeah!!

Oh, Oh.
And all I have is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill.
Over you, Over me, Over this.

Oh.
And all I have is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill.
Over you, Over me, Over this.

And all I have is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill.
Over you, Over me, Over this.---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
