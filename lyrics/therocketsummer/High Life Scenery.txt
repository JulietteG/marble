You got everybody talkin.
You got everybody goin.
You got everybody actin crazy.
I'm not gonna say you don't.

You got everybody listenin.
You got everybody puttin on a show.
You got everybody actin crazy.
I'm not gonna say you don't, You got it all wrong.

You're so scene listenin.
You can feel that you won't sing anythin.
You know you need to take it, To take this seriously.
Cause seriously this high life scenery, It makes me crazy.

Hey, What do you say? I need some help, help me out.
Boys, I'm not feelin so good.
Girls, I got the feel that you're feelin somethin.
That you say is more than you.

Everybody in here's got it goin on.
I can't compete with that.
I'll take off all my clothes to hte thrift store.
And take it all, Take it all back.

You're so scene listenin.
You can feel that you won't sing anythin.
You know you need to take it, To take this seriously.
Cause seriously this high life scenery, It's makes me...

Hey, Look what do you say?
Take a look, take a look.
You lookin at me.
Singin, Thinkin, I'm about to scream.

You're so scene listenin.
You can feel that you won't sing anythin.
You know you need to take it, To take this seriously.
Cause seriously this high life scenery, It makes me crazy.

You're so scene listenin.
You can feel that you won't sing anythin.
You know you need to take it, To take this seriously.
Cause seriously this high life scenery, It makes me crazy.---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
