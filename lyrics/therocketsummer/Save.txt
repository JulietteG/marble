I'm not feelin touch, 
I'm not makin that much,
And I guess I am blessed,
But sometimes it's just hard to see it as such.

I'm stuck alone in the traffic lines,
While couples in love in the H-O-V fly by,
I don't get, I'm not askin for much,
But everybody want's to just have...somethin.

So I'll be pickin me up, Breakin me down
I was lost, Was I found?
I wanna feel everything, 
When everyting feels wrong with me.
Take a look, Embrace myself.
Everybody want's to make it count.

Save me, Cause I can never float.
Sinkin...
Amaze me, And I would be there holdin on for life.

Sittin again, Sittin inside this drab apartment.
The walls are blank, It's like they're talkin to me.
I put a picture on the wall.
I took a chance, I took a fall.
She took off fast and gracefully.
Yes, I was blind and now I see.

So I'll be pickin me up, Breakin me down
I was lost, Was I found?
I wanna feel everything, 
When everyting feels wrong with me.
Take a look, Embrace myself.
Everybody want's to make it count.

Save me, Cause I can never float.
Sinkin...
Amaze me, And I would be there holdin on for life.

And I could tell, From the picture I could feel.
I was sinkin, Pull me out, Bring me back to life.
The colors that my eyes had never seen.
Well I can see it now!!!

Save me, Cause I can never float.
Sinkin...
Amaze me, And I would be there holdin on for life.

Save me, Cause I can never float.
Sinkin...
Amaze me, And I would be there holdin on for life.

So save..me.
Saaa-ave.
Save me.
Save me.---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
