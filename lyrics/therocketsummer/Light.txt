All I needed was a light
In the darkest place
I've ever been in all my life
As I try to find my way
And the changing seasons of my life
And my eyes don't see
The things I love have run their course
Are they done
Are they just beginning

And I'm old enough to know
That time doesn't move slow enough
And young enough to know
That I can't ever be too old enough to trust you
Higher and higher
I wanna go there with you
Some say your fire, your fire
Is through
And I don't wanna think that way

So you lost your job and lost the girl
And you crushed your soul
Around you standing out of reach
Before you know
So you wet your finger
Hold it up
But there's no wind there
Telling you where you where you should go
So you try, try to trust 
While you bear it

And I'm old enough to know
That time doesn't move slow enough
And young enough to know
That I can't ever be too old enough to trust you
Higher and higher
I wanna go there with you
Some say your fire, your fire
Is through
But I don't...

I am Yours, do what You wish
I am Yours, I am Yours
And I know this
Whatever happens next
Is in Your hands, in Your plans
Nothing less
Every day there is a choice
And through the joy
Through the pain
I will rejoice
I am Yours, do what You wish
I am Yours, I am Yours
And I know this

Save me
'Cause I need it
And I can't help but feel desperate
My desires, they seem 
Were coming to their endings
But I will trust it's not the end
But a great beginning	---Lyrics submitted by Kat.
