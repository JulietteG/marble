Somethings, I should have known to see comin.
And why is this such a burden and why can't I make it leave?
And it's funny, If I don't forget it'll kill me.
So how can I skip the time I need, To stop the rememberin?
Cause I wanna and I needa.

Waiting, Waiting
I'm tryin to get out, To get out
But I'm locked right in
So take this, Take this away from me
So I can live, So I can live

We all get there, Years go by we forget to care.
Cause years went by and there's more despair.
The cards are dealt and recieved.
And it built up, Wears me down, But it's monotonous.
My personalities colorless, Becomin bland and asleep.
And I hate it, That I'm stuck here (wasting time)

Waiting, Waiting
I'm tryin to get out, To get out
But I'm locked right in
So take this, Take this away from me
So I can live, So I can live
(OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!)

(Oh woah Oh woah Oh Oh)
(Oh woah Oh woah Oh Oh)
(Oh woah Oh woah Oh Oh)

Waiting, Waiting
I'm tryin to get out, To get out
But I'm locked right in
So take this, Take this away from me
So I can live, So I can live, So I can live
Cause I need to live, Cause I need to live---Lyrics submitted by Chrisitne.
