Hearts need a beat, like awake needs asleep
Like a pen needs a page, to learn right you need a mistake

Oh, yeah!

Hearts need a mind, like a clock needs a time
Like white needs black, if you leave I hope you need to come back

Oh, i swear, i know, i believe it
Oh, i can't stop hearing all the singing
Oh, my soul has never had this feeling
and it feels like gold

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true

Strike! all the bells, hit 'em hard , make 'em all yell
Celebrate, inflatuate, lock us up yeah incarcerate oh!

Oh, i swear, i know, i believe it
Oh, i can't stop hearing all the singing
Oh, my soul has never had this feeling
it feels like so, so

So much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah,oh, oh, c'mon, yeah..

ahhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhhhh aha ah ahhhh aha ah aha ah ah aha ah ah ahhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhh ahhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true(x3)

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs oh, oh, oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
