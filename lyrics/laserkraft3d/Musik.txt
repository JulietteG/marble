When the engine stops
I'm weightless
My mind is weightless
My body's weightless
When the engine stops

When the pressure drops
I'm weightless
My mind is weightless
My body's weightless
I don't feel anything

Go!
Ejection into open
Stars and galaxies are passing by
Velocity of light
[x2]

When the engine stops
I'm weightless
My mind is weightless
My body's weightless
When the engine stops

When the pressure drops
I'm weightless
My mind is weightless
My body's weightless
I don't feel anything at all

Go!
Ejection into open
Stars and galaxies are passing by
Velocity of light
[x2]

When the pressure drops
I'm weightless
My mind is weightless
My body's weightless
I don't feel anything

I'm weightless [repeated]
Velocity of light!

Go!
Ejection into open
Stars and galaxies are passing by
Velocity of light
[x2]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
