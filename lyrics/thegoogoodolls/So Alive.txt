Feeling like a hero, but I can't fly
No, you never crash if you don't try
Took it to de edge, now I know why
Never gonna live if you're too scared to die

Gonna disconnect from the hard wire
Time to raise a flag for the cease fire
Staring down the hole inside me
Looking in the mirror, making peace with the enemy

I'm so alive
I'm so alive
I'm so alive

You can make it on a wish if you want to
You can make it on a wish if you want to

I'm so alive
I'm so alive
I'm so alive

You can make it on a wish if you want to
You can make it on a wish if you want to

Open up my heart like a shotgun
Blinded by the light of a new sun

Get up
Get up
Get out
And get done
For the first time I feel like someone

Breaking down the walls in my own mind
Keeping my faith for the bad times

Get up
Get up
Stand like a champion
Take it to the world, gonna sing it like an anthem

I'm so alive
I'm so alive
I'm so alive

You can make it on a wish if you want to
You can make it on a wish if you want to

I'm so alive
I'm so alive
I'm so alive

You can make it on a wish if you want to
You can make it on a wish if you want to

I am no man of steel
I have no heart of stone
Don't tell me how it feels
I'll find it on my own

Never gonna live if you're too scared to die

I'm so alive
I'm so alive
I'm so alive

You can make it on a wish if you want to
You can make it on a wish if you want to

I'm so alive
I'm so alive
I'm so alive

You can make it on a wish if you want to
You can make it on a wish if you want to

I'm so alive
I'm so alive
I'm so alive---
