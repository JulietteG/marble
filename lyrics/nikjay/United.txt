We we don't don't don't lie
We we go go sky high
Deep deep into the night

I always thought that my life
Was like a movie scene
In this fantasy world
Is where I see my dreams

I have always felt that I like the Northern lives
Belongs to the sky
No regrets
No more bullshit
And no rewind

Today we feel inspired
Let me set your heart on fire
Tonight we start a riot
It only takes some people to party
But everybody is invited
Tonight we start a riot

Why don't you lift my body
Lift my body
Move my body
Love my body
Lift my body
Take me off the ground

Let's get united

Lift your body
Lift your body
Move your body
love somebody
lift your body
take you higher now

let's get united

it's going down again
good gracious
it's all good
we've doing his for ages
the door is open
my grips 's so spacious
I'm gonna lift your body up
Like is weightless
Look, go call all your friends
It's in the air tonight
Like Phil Collins sings
Such a really god wipes
I put you through stuff
If you're feeling alright
And I know you like it
Make you walk the plank
Like a pirate
Just go all out
You can't fight it
We so fly
No wings
No pilot

Today we feel inspired
Let me set your heart on fire
Tonight we start a riot
It only takes some people to party
But everybody is invited
Tonight we start a riot

Why don't you lift my body
Lift my body
Move my body
Love my body
Lift my body
Take me off the ground

Let's get united

Lift your body
Lift your body
Move your body
love somebody
lift your body
take you higher now

let's get united

Thousand hands up in the air
Love is envying my fear
Hear, we ain't going nowhere

Thousand people love in here
Feel so freaking good, I swear
we ain't going nowhere

nananna

Why don't you lift my body
Lift my body
Move my body
Love my body
Lift my body
Take me off the ground

Let's get united

Lift your body
Lift your body
Move your body
love somebody
lift your body
take you higher now

let's get united

We we don't don't don't lie
We we go go sky high
Deep deep into the night

Ohhhh

We we don't don't don't lie
We we go go sky high
Deep deep into the night

Let's get united
