Bury me with my guitar,
Bury me with my records,
Where I am going, I'm gonna need something to do,
Bury me with my guitar.

Bury me with my best t-shirt,
Bury me with my Chucks,
Where I am going, I'm gonna need something to wear,
Bury me with my black t-shirt.

Nothing ever changes, I'll be happier than heaven in hell,
Waitin for my friends and family.
Ya alright I said it, I think you're a bunch of crazies,
Lovin taking you all down with me.

Bury me with my blue spirits,
Bury me in Echo Park,
Where I am going, I'm gonna need somewhere to hang,
Bury me with my blue spirits.

Course I hope we live forever,
Get happy and can grow together, never ever have to say goodbye.
Just in case I made this list, and if you lose it I'll be pissed,
But at least I know you'll give it your best try.

We're gonna give it our best try,
We're gonna help put everything back inside,
Where I am going, I'm gonna need somebody there,
Bury me with my Mama.

Bury me next to my Mama,
Bury me next to my Pops... Pop,
Where I am going, I'm gonna need someone who cares,
Bury me with my guitar.---Lyrics submitted by Butterfer.
