A boy from Florida, took a trip to the Caribbean, oh oh
Umbrella in his Daiquiri.
Sipping, listening to Bob Marley.

He came to get away, he came to get over it. oh oh
Sunglasses and his radio,
Chilling in a hammock, swaying to-and-fro.
Whoa whoa, Soul Rebel in stereo.

You bring the ocean, I'll bring the emotion.
Together we'll make a love potion.
You bring the ocean, I'll bring the motion.
Dancing all night in slow motion.

He came to get away, he came to get over her, oh oh
Laptop and his cell phone,
Throw it in the ocean to be all alone.
Whoa whoa, Soul Rebel in stereo.

You bring the ocean, I'll bring emotion.
Together we'll make a love potion.
You bring the ocean, I'll bring the motion.
Dancing all night in slow motion.

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't you worry, boy
Take your time, don't hurry.
Don't you worry, boy.
Take your time, don't hurry,

You bring the ocean, I'll bring the emotion.
Together we'll make a love potion.
You bring the ocean, I'll bring the motion.
Dancing all night in slow motion.

You bring the ocean, I'll bring the emotion.
Together we'll make a love potion.
You bring the ocean, I'll bring the motion.
Dancing all night in slow motion.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh---Lyrics submitted by karen s hughes.
