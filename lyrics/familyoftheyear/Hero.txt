Let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight like everyone else

Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else

While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her and I out on the weekends

And we can whisper things
Secrets from my America dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight like everyone else

Ooooohh
Ooooohh

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
Just wanna fight with everyone else

Your masquerade
I don't want to be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else.---Lyrics submitted by Ethan Dibeh.
