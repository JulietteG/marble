Once I stood at the foot
Of a great high mountain
That I wanted so much to climb
And on top of this mountain was a beautiful fountain
That flowed with the waters of Life.

I fell down on my knees
At the foot of this mountain
I cried, "Oh Lord, what must I do"
I want to climb this mountain
I want to drink from this fountain
That flows so clear to my view.

Then I heard a sweet voice
From the top of this mountain
Saying, Child put your hand in mine
I started climbing slowly, watch your step at the edges
And take one step at a time.
I started climbing upward takin one step at a time
The higher I got the harder I climbed

I'm still climbing upward
And my journey almost ended
I'm nearin' the top and you ought to see the view
Oh, the water flows freely
There's enough to make you free
So friend if you're thirsty
Climb this mountain with me---Lyrics submitted by Darlene Chaffin.
