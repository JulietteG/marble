Summer
it turns me upside down, uh
Summer, Summer, Summer
it's like a merry go round
I see you under the midnight
always sat like a rose
High shoes with the cleats clickin
but then you let me go oh
but then you let me go
I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you tonight
I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you 
I got a hold on you
