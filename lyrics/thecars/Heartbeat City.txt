Heartbeat City here we come
on happy days we count on thumbs
and nothing really gets us down
as long as Jackie's back in town

I'm glad you made it, I can't complain

(Chorus)
oh Jackie, what took you so long
on just a holiday
oh Jackie, what took you so long
I thought you knew the way

the noise electric never stops
and all you need is what you got
and there's a place for everyone
under Heartbeat City's golden sun

(Chorus)

oh yea, yea, yea,

you know, 
I'm glad you made it, I can't complain
I missed you, so badly when you, jumped that train
 (Chorus)

ohh Heartbeat City lights at night
it's getting closer, out of sight
Heartbeat Citys on the loose
better catch   the blue   caboose
uh huh   Heartbeat City   It's my life---Lyrics submitted by Fun.
