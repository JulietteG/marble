I'm tired of trying to deliver
So done pretending I'm devine
It leaves me, longing to uncover
Expose the bullet holes so you can shine

Shine like diamonds shot with light
Burn like stars across the night
On fire
We could be brilliant
Like an Oslo summer sun
Blazing when the day is done
On fire
We could be brilliant

Down here everything is broken
And we smile like everything is fine
Let go the blows that break us open
It's only when we're shattered]
we can shine

Love is fire
And fire burns
But baby, what returns

We could be brilliant
One in a million
We could be brilliant---Lyrics submitted by Sarah.
