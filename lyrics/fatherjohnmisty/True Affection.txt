When can we talk
With the face
Instead of using all these strange devices?
Seems like
You and I
Need to have a crazy conversation
Wouldn't be that hard
Get along so well
Sentence by sentence
It's a trial run
Let me show you how
Figure I can give you true affection

True affection
True affection
True affection
True affection

When can we talk
With the face
Instead of using all these strange devices?
Seems like
You and I
Need to have a crazy conversation

When can we talk
With the face?
Figure I can give you true affection
Seems like
You and I
Need to have a crazy conversation

When can we talk
With the face?
Figure I can give you true affection---
