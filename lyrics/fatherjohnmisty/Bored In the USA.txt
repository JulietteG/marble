How many people rise and say 
"My brain's so awfully glad to be here 
For yet another mindless day"? 

I've got all morning to obsessively accrue 
A small nation of meaningful objects 
And they've got to represent me too 

By this afternoon, I'll live in debt 
By tomorrow, be replaced by children 

How many people rise and think 
"Oh good, the stranger's body's still here 
Our arrangement hasn't changed?" 

Now I've got a lifetime to consider all the ways 
I've grown more disappointing to you 
As my beauty warps and fades 
I suspect you feel the same 
When I was young, I dreamt of a passionate obligation to a roommate 

Is this the part where I get all I ever wanted? 
Who said that? 
Can I get my money back? 

Just a little bored in the USA 
Oh, just a little bored in the USA 
Save me, white Jesus 
Bored in the USA 
Oh, they gave me a useless education 
And a subprime loan 
On a craftsman home 
Keep my prescriptions filled 
And now I can't get off 
But I can kind of deal 
Oh, with being bored in the USA 
Oh, just a little bored in the USA 
Save me, President Jesus 
I'm bored in the USA 
How did it happen? 
Bored in the USA---
