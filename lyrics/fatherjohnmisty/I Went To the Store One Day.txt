We met in a parking lot 
Buying coffee and cigarettes 
Firewood and bad wine long since gone 
I'm still drunk and hot, by the way 
Breathing hard 

Now, in just one year's time 
I've become jealous, rail-thin, prone to paranoia when I'm stoned 
Cause isn't true love "someone oughta put me in a home?" 
Say, do you wanna get married and put an end to our endless regressive tendency scorn? 
Provincial concepts like your dowry and your daddy's farm 
For love to find us of all people 
I never thought it be so simple 

Let's buy a plantation house and let the yard grow wild until we don't need the signs that say, "Keep out" 
I've got some money left and it's cheaper in the South 
I need someone I can trust to protect me from our seven daughters when my body says, "Enough!" 
Don't let me die in a hospital, I'll save the big one for the last time we make love 
Insert here a sentiment [?] in years 
All cause I went to the store one day 
"Seen you around, what's your name?"---
