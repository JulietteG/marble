Emma eats bread and butter
Like a queen would have ostrich and cobra wine
Well have satanic Christmas Eve
And play piano in the chateau lobby

Ive never done this
Baby be gentle
Its my first time
Ive got you inside

People are boring
But youre something else completely
Lets take our chances

I wanna take you in the kitchen
Lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in
So bourgeoisie to keep waiting
Dating for twenty years just feels pretty civilian
Ive never thought that
Ever thought that once in my whole life
You are my first time

People are boring
But youre something else I cant explain
You take my last name

First time you let me stay the night
Despite your own rules
You took off early to go cheat your way through film school
You left a note in your perfect script
Stay as long as you want
I havent left your bed since

I havent hated all the same things
As somebody else since I remember
Whats going on for
What are you doing with your whole life
How about forever
How about forever---
