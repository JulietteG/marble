I hope you dont mind that I know your life, 
Because I read it everyday.
And all of your faults make me feel so good, 
Because the media stole my brain.
And its so nice to have someone,
Tell me what to think.
But what is for, 
Do we want more, Do we want more.

And on and on it goes till all of us are sucked in.
So shut it off, and see were missin out on living.
And I am so done listenin to you, 
Time for you to go, time for you to go. Woah.
I refuse to give one more day to you. 
Time for you to go time for you to go. Woah.
No more wastin my life, On this worlds addictions. 
Time for me to take, get up on your plate.
I am lettin go. Time for you to go.

Isnt it nice to know that the media will sway our votes.
Seriously weve got to see that they choose what we know.
Our morals get thrown away for the next big thing,
weve got to see
But what is it for. Do we want more. Do we want more.

And on and on it goes till all of us are sucked in.
So shut it off, and see were missin out on living.
And I am so done listenin to you, 
Time for you to go, time for you to go. Woah.
I refuse to give one more day to you. 
Time for you to go time for you to go. Woah.
No more wastin my life, On this worlds addictions. 
Time for me to take, get up on your plate.
I am lettin go. Time for you to go.

Were missing out on his voice.
Weve traded God for actions.
Weve got a thing for us this Wheres our passion!

And I am so done listenin to you, 
Time for you to go, time for you to go. Woah.
I refuse to give one more day to you. 
Time for you to go time for you to go. Woah.
No more wastin my life, On this worlds addictions. 
Time for me to take, get up on your plate.
I am lettin go. Time for you to go.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
