Wake up get out there's no time to waste now
Never shut up it's out turn to speak out 
These streets are dead just waiting to come alive
So break down the doors of our comfortable room
Tear down the walls we never could see through
Aren't we sick yet of missing out on life

Do we want more
Tell me do we want more

Cause we've heard the cry and we've come alive
We'll fight for love and we'll live to die
Because a life that holds no meaning is like a day without the light
So we've come alive tonight

All have been called but so few have listened
Life is to short you won't want to miss this
Make up our mind before life passes by
Now is the time to wake and see
This world won't revolve around you and me
So let's be the change we've all been waiting for


Do we want more
Tell me do we want more

Cause we've heard the cry and we've come alive
We'll fight for love and we'll live to die
Because a life that holds no meaning is like a day without the light
So we've come alive tonight


We are the passion
We are the movement
We are the fire 
We'll never lose it


Cause we've heard the cry and we've come alive
We'll fight for love and we'll live to die
Because a life that holds no meaning is like a day without the light
So we've come alive tonight---Lyrics submitted by Brooke.
