I am the comfortable secure 
The definition of this western world
And I have perfected deceit
Even I believe Im above saving
And Ill never let you see

I am the broken
I am the bruised
I am the poor ones
I have been used

It takes me falling to the ground
To admit to fully meeting you
Then when Im breathing my last breath 
Come and save me, I will cry to you
Cause pride has not let me say

I am the broken
I am the bruised
I am the poor ones
I have been used

Why does it take so much to bring me to my knees?
Why does it take so much pain for me to see?
If strength is only found when I am on my knees
Why is it so hard to show that I am weak?
Yeah, yeah

I am the broken
I am the bruised
I am the poor ones
I have been used---Lyrics submitted by Mae.
