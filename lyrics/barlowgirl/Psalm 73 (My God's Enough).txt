I've had enough of living life for only me 
And reaching just for the things that keep destroying me 
So sick of envying the lives of so many I see 
Somehow believing that they have what I need 

[Chorus:]
My God's enough for me 
This world has nothing I need 
In this whole life I've seen 
My God's enough, enough for me

I can't explain why I suffer though I live for You 
Those who deny You, oh, they have it better than I do 
Cover my eyes now so that my heart can finally see 
That in the end only You mean anything 

My God's 
enough for me 
This world has nothing I need 
In this whole life I've seen 
My God's enough, enough for me

Who have I in heaven but You 
Nothing I desire but You 
My heart may fail but not You 
You are mine forever (3x)

My God's enough for me 
This world has nothing I need 
In this whole life I've seen 
My God's enough

My God's  enough for me 
This world has nothing I need 
In this whole life I've seen 
My God's enough, enough for me.---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
