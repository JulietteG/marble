O come, O come Emmanuel
And ransome captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the son of God appear

Rejoice, Rejoice
Emmanuel
Shall come to thee o Israel

O come, thou rod of Jesse
Free thine own from Satan's tyranny
From depths of hell thy people save 
And give them victory o'er the grave

Rejoice, Rejoice
Emmanuel
Shall come to thee o Israel

Rejoice, Rejoice
Emmanuel
Shall come to thee o Israel

Rejoice, Rejoice
Emmanuel
Shall come to thee o Israel

Rejoice, Rejoice
Emmanuel
Shall come to thee o Israel...---Lyrics submitted by Alicia.
