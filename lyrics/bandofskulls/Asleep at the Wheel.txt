I went upstate
Asleep at the wheel, yeah
Double the win
The old leather feel, yeah
And I'm safe and sound
In equal distant dibs
My feet and that detail

'Cause where we are going
Is anyone's guess

Took the bait
So damn you, yeah
Born again
To die and too
Sun shines behind me
Behind the glass
The only, yeah
I don't have time to wonder
Don't have time to wait

'Cause where we are going
Is anyone's guess

Anyone's guess

'Cause where we are going
Is anyone's guess

Anyone's guess---
