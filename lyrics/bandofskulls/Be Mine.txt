I've done you wrong
And my life won't go on
I'll be yours
I'll be yours
If you'll be mine

Cruel to be kind
In symmetrical time
I'll be yours
I'll be yours
If you'll be mind

Hit with me your love baby
Be mine
Time ain't enough baby
To find
Hit me with your love
Be mine
All our future's in the past

Why do you threaten
To love me and leave me
Then take me back
Only to find
I'll be yours
I'll be yours
If you'll be mine

Hit me with your love
Be mine
Oh, time ain't enough, baby
To find
All our future's in the past

Hit me with your love
Be mine
Oh, time ain't enough,
To find
All our future's in the past ---
