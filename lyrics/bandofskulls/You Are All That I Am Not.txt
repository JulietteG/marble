How am I to be, all you are to me?
It could never be enough

Don't cry for tonight
Love will see you through alright
Time waits for you to stop
Yeah you are all that I am not

Lonely rivers flow
Where we'll never know
Set your beating heart free

With all your bridges burned
Tell me what you've learned
From here to God above
It's just love

Don't cry for tonight
Love will see you through alright
Time waits for you to stop
Yeah you are all that I am not

Don't cry for tonight
Love will see you through alright
Time waits for you to stop
Yeah you are all that I am not

Don't cry for tonight
Love will see you through alright
Time waits for you to stop
Yeah you are all that I am not ---
