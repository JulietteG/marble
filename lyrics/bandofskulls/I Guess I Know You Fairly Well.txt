If I tell you part of my story
Would you try to stay along?
Life's too short to worry and quarrel
Whether you're right, or whether you're wrong!
I have struggled, I have been tired
I sometimes wonder if I'm even alone
Don't you worry, I will still love you
Whether you're right, or whether you're wrong!

I guess I know you fairly well,
So keep it working!
I guess I know you fairly well,
So keep it working!
I guess I know you fairly well,
Stop been hurting!
I guess I know you fairly well,
So keep it working out!

If I've been arrow by arrow
Time by time you lose for me again,
But from the blue into the shallows
Whether you're right, or whether you're wrong
Whether you're right, or whether you're wrong!

I guess I know you fairly well,
So keep it working!
I guess I know you fairly well,
So keep it working!
I guess I know you fairly well,
Stop been hurting!
I guess I know you fairly well,
So keep it working out!

So keep it working!
Stop been hurting!
So keep it working!
Oh God, we're hurting! ---
