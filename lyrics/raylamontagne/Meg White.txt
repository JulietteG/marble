Meg White, you're alright
Fact: I think you're pretty swell
Can't you tell

Meg White, such a pretty thing
I saw your face on the cover
Of a magazine

Someday, I'd like, to take a walk with you,
Maybe ride our bikes down by the seaside

Meg White, I saw you on the big screen
Old Jack was keen,
But you stole the scene

Meg White, baby you're the bomb
Old Jack he's great, don't get me wrong
But this is your song

Someday, I'd like, to take a walk with you,
Talk about almost anything you'd like to talk about
And watch the sun goin' down, goin' down

Playing those drums is hard to do,
It's true
And nobody plays them quite like you do

Meg White, you're alright
Fact: I think you're pretty swell
Can't you tell

Meg White, such a pretty thing
I saw your face on the cover
Of a magazine

Someday, I'd like, to take a walk with you,
Maybe ride our bikes down by the seaside,
Watch the sun goin' down, goin'down, down
Goin'down, goin'down, down.---Lyrics submitted by gregg.
