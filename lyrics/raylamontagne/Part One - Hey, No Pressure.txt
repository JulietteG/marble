I hate to see you breaking down (hey, no pressure)
I hate to watch you fall apart (hey, no pressure)
I want to help you through it all (hey, no pressure, hey, no pressure)
I want to lift you when you fall (hey, no pressure, hey, no pressure)

Anything you want your life to mean it can mean
Anything you want your life to mean it can mean

This life is full of give and take (hey, no pressure)
Be careful of each step you take (hey, no pressure)
It doesn't matter lose or win (hey, no pressure, hey, no pressure)
It's all an illusion in the end (hey, no pressure, hey, no pressure)

Anything you want to be you can be
Anything you want to be you can be
Anything you want your life to mean it can mean
Anything you want your life to mean it can mean

I hate to see you crumbling (hey, no pressure)
You need to know we are your friends (hey, no pressure)
This life is full of give and take (hey, no pressure, hey, no pressure)
Be careful of the choice you make (hey, no pressure, hey, no pressure)

Anything you want your life to mean it can mean
Anything you want your life to mean
Anything you want to be you can be
Anything you want to be you can be

Hey, no pressure---
