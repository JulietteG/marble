She lifts her skirt up to her knees
Walks through the garden rows with her barefeet, laughing
I never learned to count my blessings
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters.

I walk on down the hill
through grass grown tall and brown
and still it's hard somehow to let go of my pain
On past the busted back 
of this old and rusted Cadillac
that sinks into this field collecting rain

Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged.

Of these cutthroat, busted sunsets
These cold and damp, white mornings I've grown weary
If through these cracked and dusty dimestore lips
I spoke these words out loud
No one would hear me.

Lay your blouse across the chair
Let fall the flowers from your hair
and kiss me with that country mouth, so plain.
Outside the rain is tapping on the leaves
to me, it sounds like they're applauding us
The quiet love we've made

Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged.

Well I looked my demons in the eyes
Laid bare my chest said do your best and destroy me
See I've been to hell and back so many times
I must admit you kind of bore me

There's a lot of things that can kill a man
There's a lot of ways to die
Yes and some already dead that walk beside you
There's a lot of things I don't understand
Why so many people lie
Well it's the hurt I hide that fuels the fires inside me

Will I always feel this way
So empty, so estranged---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
