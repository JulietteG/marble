We sat in the grass 'neath the evening Sun
Breathing in the air as the children run

When I am with you
When I am with you
I'm right where I belong
And I am
Right where I belong

Weaving in circles the starlight surrounds us
Leaves me
Me questioning all with no answers

When I am with you
When I am with you
I'm right where I belong
And I am
Right where I belong

Never gonna hear this song on the radio
Never gonna hear this song on the radio
Never gonna hear this song
Never gonna hear this song
Never gonna hear this song

But wouldn't it make a lovely photograph?---
