A Billboard, Back Road, Meadow
Sunset through the trees. I can' t remember the faces I've seen
Low and mean

High Rise, White light, Shadows
Years in the air
I don' t recall all the "why" or the "where" or "who was there"

Show me the Feathers you've found
The glass in the ground
A comforting sound when the lights are down

Hillside flush with the Sunrise
Spring in the air
I can't remember a morning so fair, Not a care

Show me the Feathers you've found
The glass in the ground
A comforting sound when the lights are down

The Birdsong, tugging on my slumber
Opens my eyes
Slowly I am woken to find
Your hand in mine

Show me the Feathers you' ve found
The glass in the ground
A comforting sound when the lights are down

A Billboard, a Back Road, a Meadow
Sunset through the trees
I can't recall all the faces I' ve seen
So low and mean

The Birdsong, tugging on my slumber
Opens my eyes
Slowly I am woken to find
Your hand in mine

Show me the Feathers you've found
The glass in the ground
A comforting sound when the lights are down---
