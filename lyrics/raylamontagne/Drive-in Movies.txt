Spend all my childhood years
Wishing that I'd look like a movie star
Cigarette behind my ear
Leaning up against a muscle car

Wanna know the things that I should've known
Got smokes that I stole from a 7-O
Everybody's at the drive-in I wanna go

Wanna be the guy "doesn't like to fight"
Who can kick your ass if you touch his girl
Wanna be the guy "breaks all the rules"
But the cops let him off 'cause they think he's cool

Wanna know the things that I should've known
Got smokes that I stole from a 7-O
Everybody's at the drive-in I wanna go

CHORUS:
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies
Aaahhh

Grew up fast in a Nebraska town
Nothing goin' on in Pleasenton
All them boys is never around
Just me and the guys skipping school

Wanna know the things that I should've known
Got smokes that I stole from a 7-O
Everybody's at the drive-in I wanna go

CHORUS:
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies
Aaahhh

I wanna be Brando in the Wild One
I wanna be something to someone
'cause nothing ever changes in this town
Same old crew hanging around
To bring me some shit to go down

Hey love aaahhh

CHORUS:
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies
Aaahhh

Now I'm grown, kids of my own
Never thought I could be a dad
Me and my girl going strong
Still the best friend that I ever had

Now I know the things that I didn't know
Got smokes but I bought 'em now at the gas & oil
Drive in's just an empty lot no one knows

I miss those
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies

CHORUS:
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies
Drive-in movies
Aaahhh

Spend all my childhood years
Wishing that I'd look like a movie star---
