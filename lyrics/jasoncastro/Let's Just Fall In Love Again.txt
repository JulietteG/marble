Let's pretend baby
That you've just met me
And I've never seen you before

I'll tell all my friends
That I think your starrin
And you say the same to yours
And oh, well dance around it all night
And then I'll follow you outside
I try to open up my mouth 
and nothing comes out right
and I wanna fall in love with you again
I don't have to try 
its so easy who needs to pretend?
But because it's so funny
Let's just think about it honey
Let's just fall in love again

I'll call you in three days
Not too soon not too late
And I'll ask your room mate if your home

You'll call me on Thursday
And we'll hang out all day
And fall asleep on the floor


And oh, I'll hold your hand when we drive
And we'll loose track of all the time
And we'll tell everyone that we ain't never felt so alive
And I wanna fall in love with you again

I don't have to try
It's so easy who needs to pretend 
But because it's so funny
Let's just think about it honey
Let's just fall in love again

We'll fall discutingly fast
And we'll stop hanging out with friends
And they'll be so affended
Oh ooh oh

And I wanna fall in love with you again
I don't have to try
It's so easy who needs to pretend?
But because 
it's so funny
Let's just think about it honey
Let's just fall in love again
Let's just fall in love again
So let's just fall in love again---Lyrics submitted by jocelyn.
