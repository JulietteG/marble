You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my cloths up when i'm gone
you can tell your friends just what a fool i've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
you can tell my feet to hit the floor
or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
they won't be reachin out for you no more

but dont tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
i just dont think he'd understand
and if you tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
he might blow up and kill this man

you can tell my ma i moved to arkansas
you can tell your dog to bite my leg
or tell your brother cliff whose fist can tell my lip
that he never really liked me anyway
or tell your aunt louise tell anything you please
myself already knows im not okay
or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind

but dont tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
i just dont think he'd understand
and if you tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
he might blow up and kill this man might be walking out on him today ---Lyrics submitted by Emily.
