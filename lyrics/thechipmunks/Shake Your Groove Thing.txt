Shake Your Groove Thing(yeah).
C'mon.

Chorus:
Shake your groove thing,shake your groove thing.Yeah,yeah.
Show 'em how you do it now.
Shake your groove thing,shake your groove thing.Yeah,yeah.
Show 'em how you do it now.

Verse 1:
Let's show the world we can dance(dance).
Bad enough to strut our stuff.
The music gives us a chance(chance).
We do more out on the floor.
Groovin' loose or heart to heart.
We put in motion every single part.
Funky sounds wall to wall.
We're bumpin' bodies.Havin' us a ball,y'all.

(Repeat "Chorus")

Rap-(2x):
Do it now,shake it down.Shake your body all around.Do it now,upside down.Come on y'all,let's show them how.

Verse 2:
We got the rhythm tonight(night).
All the rest know,we're the best.
So,shadows flashing in the light(yeah).
Twistin',turnin',we keep burnin'.
[ Alvin And The Chipmunks Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ] 
Shake it high,shake it low.
We take our bodies,where they wanna go.
Feel that beat,never stop.
Oh,hold me tight,spin me like a top.

(Repeat "Chorus")

(Repeat "Rap")

Bridge:
There's nothing more(nothing more)
that I'd like to do(like to do)
than take the floor(take the floor)
and dance with you.
Keep dancin',let's keep dancin'.

Alvin:Let's keep dancin'.

Shake your groove thing.
Alvin,Simon,Theodore.
Shake your groove thing.

Shake your groove thing.

Theodore:Shake it now.
