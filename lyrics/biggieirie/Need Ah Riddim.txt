When ah wining
I not me who wining
It the rhythm total in control
When ah drifting
I not me who drifting
You could blame it all on the alcohol
There this kinda feeling
You cannot buy it from a store
Got to come from inside ah yuh
Just dig deep in down and 
you will find new meaning

So when you see me wining
And keeping with the timing
Doh watch me say 
Doh blame me 

Its not me
Its the riddem in the waist
That have me wining so 
Is the vibes in the place
That have be jamming so 
Is the riddem in the waist
That have me wining so 
Is the vibes in the place

And thats why everyone needs
To break away nnees
To jam out the needs
To play ah mass
In the carnival needs
Ah break away needs
To jam out they need
To play ah mass
In the carnival needs
Ah break away needs
To play ah mass

When ah grooving 
Its not me who grooving 
Its the rhythm totally in control
And if ah falling down down down
Its not me who falling
Its because I drink too much alcohol

well this kind of feeling
It dont happen everyday
Is a special time of year
Like when the sun shining and the
truck rolling steady
?
Thats when masqueraders ready 
To hold onto sombody 
Doh watch me say 
yuh better doh blame me 

Its not me
Its the riddem in the waist
That have me wining so 
Is the vibes in the place
That have me jamming so 
Is the riddem in the waist
That have me wining so 
Is the vibes in the place

And thats why everyone needs
To break away nnees
To jam out the needs
To play ah mass
In the carnival needs
Ah break away needs
To jam out they need
To play ah mass
In the carnival needs
Ah break away needs
To play ah mass

well this kind of feeling
It dont happen everyday
Is a special time of year
Like when the sun shining and the
truck rolling steady
?
Thats when masqueraders ready 
To hold onto sombody 
Doh watch me say 
yuh better doh blame me 

Its not me
Its the riddem in the waist
That have me wining so 
Is the vibes in the place
That have me jamming so 
Is the riddem in the waist
That have me wining so 
Is the vibes in the place

And thats why everyone needs
To break away nnees
To jam out the needs
To play ah mass
In the carnival needs
Ah break away needs
To jam out they need
To play ah mass
In the carnival needs
Ah break away needs
To play ah mass
