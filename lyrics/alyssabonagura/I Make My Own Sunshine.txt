Everything is wonderful
Everything is great
Free as a bird singing outside my window pane
Got a fresh new start
It's a brand new day
I got lots of love to give away

It don't matter if if's rainin'
Nothing can phase me
I make my own sunshine
If you think you can break me
Baby your crazy
I make my own sunshine (3x)

Hey! Let's make a rainbow
Look for the Pot'O Gold
I'll show you how to keep it nice and easy
Even if a cloud starts forming on my lovely day
There's nothing, NO nothing
That could stand in my way

It dont matter if if's rainin'
Nothing can phase me
I make my own sunshine
If you think you can break me
Baby your crazy
I make my own sunshine (3x)---
