Singing to the same old song
Driving down yesterdays road
Only this radio knows I'm down
Walking through an empty house
Straighten up our picture frame
Wandering if we're in the right place
We got nothing left to say
Quietly slipping away

We keep spinning around
Two feet on the ground
Theres no turning down when you're this broken down
Just a matter of time
So why don't we say goodbye

Love has everything we need
But it won't live if it can't breathe
Tell me why we didn't see the storm clouds roll in
Without a warning

We keep spinning around
Two feet on the ground
Theres no turning down when you're this broken down
Just a matter of time
So why don't we say goodbye

We can't say goodbye
I can't hold on any longer i should let you go
We can't say goodbye
I can't hold on any longer baby we both know
We can't say goodbye
I can't hold on I can't hold on
It's over but we both can't face it
We both know that we cant make it now

We keep spinning around
Two feet on the ground
Theres no turning down when you're this broken down
Just a matter of time
So why don't we say goodbye

We keep spinning around
Two feet on the ground
Theres no turning down when you're this broken down
Just a matter of time
So why can't we say goodbye

Goodbye---Lyrics submitted by Olivia Leisk.
