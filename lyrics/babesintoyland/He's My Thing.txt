He's my thing, stay away from my thing
Why don't you get your own wow wowow
Well he's my thing

He's my thing, I kept for myself
And not for you
He's my thing I kept for myself
And nobody else

He's my thing, stay away from my thing
Why don't you get your own wow wowow
Well he's my thing

Walks around in her boyfriend's clothes
Nobody knows
She knows, she goes, well she goes

He's my thing, stay away from my thing
Why don't you get your own wow wowow
Well he's my thing

He's my thing, I keep on a hook
keep on a hook
She knows, she goes, well she goes

He's my thing, stay away from my thing
Why don't you get your own wow wowow
Well he's my thing---Lyrics submitted by es.
