I remember way back when
Way back when
You...
Times weren't this hard
No they weren't this hard
And everyone had what we call
A sane mind
Roses are red,
Well blood is too
And I found that out
When I needed you
So you remember me that one time you promised me, yeah?
No wait it was more than once now wasn't it, huh?
Just wait how many little precious promises
those little precious promises that you have broken to me, yeah


Where's your morals, lost your mind
Head must be where the sun don't shine
Where's your morals, lost your mind

Hangin on a rope staring at you
Hangin on a rope staring at you
Hangin on a rope staring at you

Ah, ah
I want you as you want me right now
I want you as you want me right now
I want you as you want me right now
That luxury life ain't for you anyhow

I want you as you want me
Black and white, can't you see
Iwant you, as you want me, in black & white, oh can't ya' see.
Those black clouds that linger over you and me, is gonna kill me can't you see.

Your love has infected me, like that big, bad disease, your love has affected me.
Ah, ah
I want you as you want me right now
I want you as you want me right now
I want you as you want me right now
That luxury life ain't for you anyhow

I want you as you want me
Black and white, can't you see
Those black clouds that linger over you and me, is gonna kill me can't you see.

Those promises you broke to me
Those promises you broke to me
How many times you gonna nail me,
To the cross, with all those promises 
Those precious little promises
that you have broken to me---Lyrics submitted by es.
