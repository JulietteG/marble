I'm not gonna try and tell you that I'm giving you all the best
I've been subject to the same destruction of desire
Felt the same effects 

I'm a hetero-sexists tragedy
And portential rapists all are we
Yeah

But don't tell me this is natural, this is nuturing
There's a difference between sexism and sexuality
I had deifferent desires prior to my role remodeling,
And at 6 years of age you don't challenge their claims 
you become the same
or withdraw from the game - hang you head in shame
I think that's what I did
Try to sever connections
Between me 
And them

I fought against their further attempts to convince and kid that birthrights can bestow
The power to yeild the subordination of women
And do you know 
what patrocentricity means?
I found out just a couple of days ago
It male values uber ales 
And what do you know

Sex has been distorted and vilified
I'm scared of my attration to body types
If everything desired is objectified
The maybe eroticism, needs to be redefined
and
And I refuse to be a man---Lyrics submitted by M.
