Mark your point of failing
Begins where you concede
Hesitate. Procrastinate. Sedating.
Configured to impede
Your path
You need a good kick in the ass
Now take a step back and have a long look
Hold it to the light and read it like a book
Analyse the opast and present and see what is to come
Now wrap you lips around the barrel of a gun

Mark my point of failing 
Began when I gave in
Comfort. Convenience. Placating.
Construed to suck me in.
To their trap
I need a good kick in the ass 

As time passed I realised we don't need rules to survive
Common sense means to subsist
From here on in
I will resist

I've finally realised
Found my way at last
It's finally evident
We all need a kick in the ass

The basis of change: 
Educate!
Derived from discussion
Not hate, not myth, not muscle, not etiquette
Intellect, not re-elect
Status symbols yeild to respect between sex, species, environment---Lyrics submitted by M.
