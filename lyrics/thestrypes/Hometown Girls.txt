I wanna tell you but I can't spit it out
T-t-t-tripping on my tongue and my mouth is stiff
Feels like I'm hanging off the edge of a cliff
And my eyes can't pick a pocket where they're happy to stick
I'm running from the point 
Babe, I'm missing a trick with you
My line is up but girl I'm missing my cue.

Chorus: 
But can't you give me a fix, so I'm craving confidence?
Well, I reek of sweat and teenage innocence
Well, I want you so, but I know you'll never know
Cause I'm too shy, I'm too shy for the hometown girl!

I wanna tell you but I'm sick with the fright
S-s-s-slipping up I'm caught in the light of lust
I get the feeling that you ain't too fussed.
My head feels heavy as the regret sinks in
I shouldn't be afraid to take it on the chin 
But I duck, I miss the jab but I'm hit with the hook

Chorus: (x3)
But can't you give me a fix, so I'm craving confidence?
Well, I reek of sweat and teenage innocence
Well, I want you so, but I know you'll never know
Cause I'm too shy, I'm too shy for the hometown girl!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
