Blue collar Jane lives in 54
Always has a teacup when she knocks upon my door
She just wants some milk and sugar but all I want is her
Blue collar Jane, my girl, you're causing quite a stir

All we could be, b-l-u-e
C-o-l-l-a-r J-a-n-e, oh baby please,
If you could see, then you'd agree
That I love blue collar Jane and she loves me

Blue collar Jane, always in your town
Never wears her hair up cause she's always dressing down
You got a 4 wheel drive? You know that's how she gets around
Blue collar Jane, my girl, you knock me to the ground

All we could be, b-l-u-e
C-o-l-l-a-r J-a-n-e, oh baby please,
If you could see, then you'd agree
That I love blue collar Jane and she loves me

Watch out!

Blue collar Jane, always in your town
Never wears her hair up cause she's always dressing down
You got a 4 wheel drive? You know that's how she gets around
Blue collar Jane, my girl, you knock me to the ground

All we could be, b-l-u-e
C-o-l-l-a-r J-a-n-e, oh baby please,
If you could see, then you'd agree
That I love blue collar Jane and she loves me
That I love blue collar Jane and she loves me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
