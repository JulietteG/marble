Ya ever feel like you're standing in glue 
Going nowhere, yeah man, me too 
Busting your butt just trying to get ahead 
Wind up tasting a little dust instead 
Buddy, I swear that pretty thing of mine 
Don't ask for much but I'd be lyin' 
If I said, I didn't want to give her everything that shines 

Cold beer conversations 
Just a couple old boys, a little time well wasted 
Trying to figure out life 
Trying to figure out girls 
Trying to find our place in this crazy old world 
A little truth, a little frustration 
Cold beer conversation 

Man, don't you miss those Friday night lights? 
Wouldn't you like to bust through that paper one more time? 
Brother, my folks are gettin' up there in years 
Momma still thinks the devil's in here 
Now tell me buddy, don't you ever wish 
We could work a little less, catch a few more fish? 
Yeah, maybe one day when we both strike it rich 

Cold beer conversations 
Just a couple old boys, a little time well wasted 
Trying to figure out life 
Trying to figure out girls 
Trying to find our place in this crazy old world 
A little truth, a little frustration 
Cold beer conversation 

We could sit here all night trying to make it make sense 
A little buzz is probably all we're gonna get 
But that's alright 

Cold beer conversations 
Just a couple old boys, a little time well wasted 
Trying to figure out life 
Trying to figure out girls 
Trying to find our place in this crazy old world 
A little truth, a little frustration 
It's just us man, go on and say it 
Cold beer conversation---
