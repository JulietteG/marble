I am not gonna lay around and whine and mourn for somebody that done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I am gonna sit around and sing some old sad song
I believe it's half full not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moon shine
When I'm gone put it in stone "He left nothing behind"
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do but I like to do just what I like
I take the chance, dance the dance, it might be wrong but then again it might be right
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything---
