The stars at night - are big and bright
Deep in the heart of Texas
The prairie sky - is wide and high
Deep in the heart of Texas

The sage in bloom - is like perfume
Deep in the heart of Texas
Reminds me of - the one I love
Deep in the heart of Texas
The cowboys cry - ki-yip-pie-yi
Deep in the heart of Texas
The rabbits rush - around the brush

Deep in the heart of Texas
The coyotes wail - along the trail
Deep in the heart of Texas
The doggies bawl - and bawl and bawl
Deep in the heart of Texas---Lyrics submitted by rita wedemeyer.
