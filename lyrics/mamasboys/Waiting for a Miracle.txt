Just a handful of heroes
Wearing rags against the cold
Last fight for freedom
Fuse the fire in our souls
Standing shoulder to shoulder
Feeling proud and growing strong
Hard-eyed and reckless
In the calm before the storm

* Liberty for your and me
Together we could light the fuse
Reaching our for victory
You know there's nothing left to lose

** Dont stop waiting for a miracle
Running inside, that's the way to survive
D0nt stop waiting for a miracle
Keep the flame alive
Dont stop waiting for a miracle
Live it on the dream
There's a new tomorrow now

Within bold and barefoot
In the world 0f broken glass
Brave man for we read
The the fears an the past
You see the sore tunes of fortune
Play ham caught to take in size
God help the gamblers
Say your prayers and roll the dice

Shine alrght day and night
Be sure that everybody sees
Find a way to break away
Before they bring it to your knees

** repeat
* repeat
** repeat---Lyrics submitted by tac.
