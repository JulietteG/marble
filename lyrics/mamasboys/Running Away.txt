I can see it in your empty eyes
Feel the pain no compromise
In your heart
Time passes by
Dont want this anger burning in me
Whats done is done just let it be
Turn aside and time passes by

* But it's too late. its too late
For making changes
|ts too late, were drifting apart
Yes, Im running away from the pain of the past
No I dont care whos right or wrong
Im running away, this time it will last
And I couldnt love you much better

The tears that fall in sorrows rain
The price we pay to lift the chains in our lives
And time passes by
