Nigga get a life, ten deep crewneck 
Blunt to the face nigga, never ask who's next
Homie, I ain't two Tecs, that's BIG homie, ay
Where the fuck was his gangster ass out in LA
A Bay Bay, this is a not a dis
But your bitch look like Hurricane Chris
And nigga it's fact,
that what you rap fiction
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Your bitches do my braids, say dog I be hittin'
Never knew my dick be where you be kissin'
When I shoot missions, gotta keep a clip in
Or roll deep like roaches in my kitchen
Dog, I ain't trippin', but they never gone
They don't even run when I cut the lights on
Homes what's the biz? Nigga watch yo' kids
Ya bitch say my dick bigger than John Holmes'
Limes in Corona, 2 for 18, 
Might pop Adderall, I don't fuck with no lean
Didn't at a mall, nigga fuck 'em all
Walk in thrift stores now watch daddy ball
Vintage ass fleeces, skinny, no creases
Me and these is like ETs and Reeses Pieces
Layin' on beaches, ho's toe's pedicured
Bitch gave me head 'cause she liked my metaphors
Bout gettin' head, isn't that ironic like Alanis Morrissette?

Check
Tight like corsets 'round the waists of S&M; bitches
Bitch ass fat like Delicious is 
Hoes say I'm inconsiderate 
'Cause I make 'em treat my dick like licorice
They can get a pack of Twizzlers on me
Light skinned bitch, that I call darkie
Always in beef like Eek The Cat & Sharkie
So I ate the cat, now she heart me
Roll another spliff, pop another pill
Live every day like a nigga goin' away
Window didn't lock, fuck 'em with the pot
Gotta nigga two hots and a top cot
So niggas like to plot, I move on instinct
Nigga I could walk down a year on the precinct
And these bars'll still be hotter than your new shit
Why you tryna keep it warm like somebody else piss
In that drop on the way to the P.O.
You talk shit, turn his bitch to El Nino
Red jalepeno, flow Neo-Geo
Rock like Lil' John "Bia Bia" live in Rio
Nigga, you a peepshow, fuckin' quarter freak ho
Hit you with the psycho, now you el finito---Lyrics submitted by Johnny Sauce.
