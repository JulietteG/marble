If you had an empty suitcase 
I'd help you to pack it tight.
And if you were afraid of darkness,
Well I would stay 'til it was light.
And if you were a supermodel,
Well I would help you lift your bags.
I'd push those paparazzis over, 
So you could get inside your cab.

If you found your toothpaste empty
I would squeeze out just a little more.
And if you had the sweetest big dream
I'd high five you 'til our hands were sore.
And if you were scared and worried,
Well I would keep you safe and sound.
And if you were addicted to fabric,
Well you could fill a whole room in our house.

If we climbed the highest treetop, 
And you said you couldn't climb back down,
Well I would build the finest tree house
For our new life above the ground.
And when you smile at me so sweetly,
Well I love what happens in your eyes.
And they open up to me, my darling,
And it's all I need and it's so right.

Oh, I have got a thousand reasons
For you to come away with me.
The more I look the better you seem,
And I hope that in your heart you see.

Oh, 'cause I believe that you are all I want.
Oh, 'cause I believe that you and I belong.---Lyrics submitted by Kellyn.
