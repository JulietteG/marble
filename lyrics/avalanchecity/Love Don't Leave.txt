Her cheeks were red and cold
and i held her hand in mine
she squeezed it tight and i felt the warmth
escape my bones inside

we saw a storm from far away
and we laughed as it wandered by
then it turned around to hunt us down
so we ran away to hide and she said

love don't leave me now
love don't leave me now

her heart was beating fast
and i hoped that we could stay
in our hiding place where it was warm
and cold could not invade

we laughed aloud and talked of things
that happened yesterday
but the storm could hear our voices clear
so it came on its way and she said

love don't leave me now
love don't leave me now

well lives in love wont last
if they wont face the day
will you answer this she said
and i hoped it was just a game

but i saw her skin change before me
and cold became her face
so i took my hand from hers
and began to walk away

love don't leave me now
love don't leave me now

love don't leave me now
love don't leave me now---Lyrics submitted by Opi Dreamer.
