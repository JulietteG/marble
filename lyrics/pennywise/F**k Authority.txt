Someday you gotta find another way, you better right your mind 
and live by what you say
Today is just another day unless you set your sights and try to find a way
I say fuck authority
Silent majority
Raised by the system
Now it's time to rise against them
We're sick of your treason
Sick of your lies
Fuck no, we won't listen
We're gonna open your eyes
Frustration, domination, feel the rage of a new generation, 
we're livin', we're dyin' and we're never gonna stop, stop tryin'
Stop tryin'
Stop tryin', stop tryin'

You know the time is right to take control, 
we gotta take offense against the status quo
No way, not gonna stand for it today, fight for your rights, 
it's time we had our say

I say fuck authority
Silent majority
Raised by the system
Now it's time to rise against them
We're sick of your treason
Sick of your lies
Fuck no, we won't listen
We're gonna open your eyes
Frustration, domination, feel the rage of a new generation, 
We're livin', we're dyin', we're sick and tired of the endless liein' Destroy, 
Enjoy, your fucking world is our new toy, dominate, eliminate, 
Your gonna feel the wrath, wrath of hate?

Fuck authority
Silent majority
Raised by the system
Now it's time to rise against them
We're sick of your treason
Sick of your lies
Fuck no, we won't listen
We're gonna open your eyes
Frustration, domination, feel the rage of a new generation, 
we're livin', we're dyin' and we're never gonna stop, stop tryin'
Stop tryin'
Stop tryin', stop tryin'---Lyrics submitted by yesenia.
