Told to follow- 
Hard to swallow 
Don't you know that they're wasting your time 
But they need you 
and beseech you 
To support their bastion of crime 

The darkness is falling 
Can we wake up in time? 
We can't lose the battle 
Lose it today keep the good times away 
Give me something to live for 
we're finding a way 
out of the shadows 
You've got to show me that we can live for today 

Never listen, 
don't ask questions 
Don't expect them 
To tell you the truth 
They'll deceive you and besiege you 
With the lies they disguise just for you 

The darkness is falling 
Can we wake up in time? 
We can't lose the battle 
Lose it today keep the good times away 
Give me something to live for 
we're finding a way 
out of the shadows 
You've got to show me that we can live for today 

Fall and sorrow 
For tomorrow 
Days of pain that are waiting for you 
Time is bleeding 
Keeps repeating 
My lifetime to find out the truth 

The darkness is falling 
Can we wake up in time? 
We can't lose the battle 
Lose it today keep the good times away 
Give me something to live for 
we're finding a way 
out of the shadows 
You've got to show me that we can live for today---Lyrics submitted by Nancy.
