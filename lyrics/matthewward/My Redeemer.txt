Here I go again
I'm thinking of the time when I will stand
and look into the eyes
of my Redeemer

Words won't come my way
And deep inside my silent accolades
I'll find my voice to sing of my Redeemer

And I know upon this earth I'll never find
The words that can express my heart of mine

When with His words of life
He spoke and pulled my dark soul from the night
How can I repay my Redeemer

With His wounded hands 
He held my broken heart to understand
I never can repay
My Redeemer

And I know upon this earth I'll never find
The words that can express my heart oh mine

Here I go again
I'm thinking of the time when I will stand
and look into the eyes
of my Redeemer
of my Redeemer
my Redeemer---Lyrics submitted by Don Viray.
