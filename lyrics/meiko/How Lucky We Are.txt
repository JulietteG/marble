One day, we'll get out of this shitty apartment
One day is all it takes for things to turn around
 Now all I know is I got you and you got me, babe

And when that morning comes
 I'll make coffee and you'll read the paper
 We'll talk about our plans
 And I'll keep saying how lucky we are

One day we'll get in the car and drive anywhere we wanna go
 And then we'll stay in a five star mini-bar luxury hotel room
 Cause all I know is I got you and you got me, babe

And when that morning comes
 I'll make coffee and you'll read the paper
 We'll talk about our plans
 And I'll keep saying how lucky we are

How lucky we are, oh oh oh
 How lucky we are, oh oh oh
 How lucky we are, oh oh oh
 How lucky we are, oh oh

One day we'll turn on the TV
 And we won't see nothing 'bout war.
 And when that morning comes
 I'll make coffee and you'll read the paper
 We'll talk about our plans
 And I'll keep saying how lucky we are

How lucky, how lucky we are, oh
 How lucky, how lucky, how lucky we are, oh
 How lucky, how lucky, how lucky we are, oh
 How lucky, how lucky, how lucky we are.---Lyrics submitted by Gabi Ramsey.
