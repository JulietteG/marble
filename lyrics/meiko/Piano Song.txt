Every little thing I do I do for, you.
With every little thing I think a thought of, you.
I try so hard not to notice.
I try so hard not to care.
I try so hard to know that your not, here.
But im counting down the hours , and
Im counting down the days.
I try so hard not to show this side of me...

Jealous of the way they walk the way they... talk.
Cause i dont know they know just what
They got.
Jealous of the way they look, the 
Way they are.
But I just want to be the way
We were.

I try so hard not to notice.
I try so hard not to care.
I try so hard to know that your not, here.
But im counting down the hours,
Im counting down the days.
I try so hard not to show this side of me.

And i try so hard not to notice,
And i try so hard not to care..
I try so hard not to know that your not here....
But im counting down the hours,
And im counting up the days.
I try so hard not to show this side of me.

This side of me...
This side of me...
This side of me...
This side of me...
This side of me...
This side of me...
This side of me...
This side of me...
This side of me...---Lyrics submitted by Brittani.
