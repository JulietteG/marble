Give me a reason to fall in love
Take my hand and let's dance
Give me a reason to make me smile
Cause I think I forgot how

I wanna fall asleep with you tonight
I wanna know that I am safe when you hold me tight
I wanna feel like I wanna feel forever

Girls need attention, and boys need us
So let's make everybody glad
That they have each other in each others arms
Oh let's make everybody glad

I want you.

I wanna dream away with you tonight
We can go anywhere you would like
I wanna feel how I wanna feel forever

I want you.---Lyrics submitted by Tami.
