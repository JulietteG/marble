I wanna go to Hawaii
Build my castle out of sand
And I won't need anybody
Telling me that I can't

And you can't say that you're seeing me
If you don't know who I am
You can't say that you need me
And neither one of us can be found
If neither one of us can be found

I wanna soak up the water
I dream about you every night
And in my mind will be an order
Take it away in just one flight

And you can't say that you're seeing me
If you don't know who I am
You can't say that you need me
And neither one of us can be found
If neither one of us can be found
If neither one of us can be found---Lyrics submitted by nikita.
