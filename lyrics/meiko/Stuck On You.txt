I must confess
When I wear this dress
I feel like dancing
The whole night with you
do do do do do
do do do do do
I feel so happy
I'm stuck on you

Cuz you are the one
I could see myself fallin in love with
Not just for tonight
But for the rest of my life
You are the one i could nvver be done with
I want you tonight and for the rest of my life too
do do do do do
do do do do do

You are so dreamy
Feel like im in the movies
I feel so happy I'm stuck on you

Cuz you are the one
I could see myself fallin in love with
Not just for tonight
But for the rest of my life
You are the one i could nvver be done with
I want you tonight and for the rest of my life too
do do do do do
do do do do do

I'm stuck on you.
you
I'm stuck on you
you

Cuz you are the one
I could see myself fallin in love with
Not just for tonight
But for the rest of my life


Cuz you are the one
I could see myself fallin in love with
Not just for tonight
But for the rest of my life
You are the one i could nvver be done with
I want you tonight and for the rest of my life too

do do do do do
