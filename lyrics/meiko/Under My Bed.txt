Now my eyes are wide open
Now that everything's been stolen
And I'm here to get it back from you

See, I ain't wasting no more time
I gotta take back what's mine
And what else am I supposed to do?

Here I am, with my heart on the floor
And my love out the door
You should be knocking
There it goes
I got nothing to show for
Except pictures I pose for
But I keep them in a box under my bed

I told you time and again
That you'd never win
I told you time and again
But you keep doing those same old things
When I thought that you would change
I told you time and again

Here I am, with my heart on the floor
And my love out the door
You should be knocking
There it goes
I got nothing to show for
Except pictures I pose for
But I keep them in a box under my bed

Here I am with my heart on the floor
And my love out the door
There it goes I got nothing to show for
Except pictures I pose for

Here I am, with my heart on the floor
And my love out the door
You should be knocking
There it goes
I got nothing to show for
Except pictures I pose for
But I keep them in a box under my bed---Lyrics submitted by LovleyLady23.
