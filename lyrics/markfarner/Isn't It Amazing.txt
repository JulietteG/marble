Rain...Rain, Won't ya please go away...
Save all your grey skies for another day,
I've had my share of all your trials and tears
I've found someone new who'll make them all dis-appear
Suddenly they've all dis-appeared

Isn't it amazing what a prayer can do...
When it all seems hopeless it'll pull ya through,
And isn't it amazing how a broken heart grows strong
When every now-and-then that special someone comes along

Sun-Shine, your an old friend of mine
Haven't seen you 'round here for a long, long time
It feels so good to have your face shinin' down
Giving me strength to help me carry on...
Helping me to carry on...

Hey-Hey...Isn't it amazing what a prayer can do
When it all seems hopeless it'll pull ya through,
And isn't it amazing how a broken heart grows strong
When every now-and-then that special Someone comes along

I admit that there were times when the whole world seemed to turn away...
The clouds rolled in, and the rain came down...
For the first time in my lifetime I prayed.
I got down on my knees......Ooawww 

Isn't it amazing what a prayer can do
When it all seems hopeless it'll pull ya through,
And isn't it amazing how a broken heart grows strong
When every now-and-then that special Someone comes along...

Every now and then....
Someone....
Comes along...along...along

Isn't it amazing how a broken heart grows strong...when every now and then that special Someone comes along...
...what a prayer can do...Ooooo....It'll pull ya through
And isn't it amazing how a broken heart grows strong when every now and then that special Someone......comes along...

Amen!---Lyrics submitted by Sue Anderson.
