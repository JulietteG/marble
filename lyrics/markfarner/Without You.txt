Draw me and I will run to you
Cause my heart to sing the praises that I do
To a holy God and Savior to my loving King
Endless,  is the love you show to me
Not holding back I must give willingly
All I am and all Ill ever be

(chorus)
So please help me
To hold on to you and not let go
For my life is nothing without you
Help me to see that you were all I needed
I cant live without you

Trials they come to strengthen me
Youre coming soon so live faithfully
And a crown of life will be given to me

(chorus)
Please help me
To hold on to you and not let go
For my life is nothing without you Lord
Help me to see that you were all I needed
I cant live without you

(bridge)
And the overcomers will be dressed in white
And their names will never be erased 
from the book of life

(chorus)
please help me
To hold on to you and not let go
For my life is nothing without you Lord
Help me to see that you were all I needed
I cant live 
Please help me
To hold on to you and not let go
For my life is nothing without you
Help me to see that you were all I needed
I cant live 
Yes I know, I cant live without you.---Lyrics submitted by Steve Worsham.
