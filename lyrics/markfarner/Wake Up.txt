You know Jesus came for the remission of sins
And in His name is where it begins
If you ain't a sinner 
Then you ain't alive
And every other thing that you've heard
Ain't nothing but jive

(Chorus)
You better wake up - I hear Jesus knockin' now
Wake up at the door
Wake up - there's no time left for mockin' him
Don't you know it's you He's there for

You got to get on down
Get down on your knees
And ask for forgiveness
Just say "Jesus please"
"please forgive, cause I know what I was
Now I plead the blood of your mercy
'Cause I know what it does

(Chorus)You better wake-up - I hear someone knockin' now.
Wake up-at the door
Wake up-there's no time left for mockin' Him
Don't you know it's you He's there for---Lyrics submitted by Dirk.
