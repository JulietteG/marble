Someone depends on me
And all at once I see
Just what it means to be a man

I Love Therefore I AM
(I am I am)

Someone believes in me
Looks to me trustingly
Anything I want to be I can

I Love Therefore I AM (I am I am)

Oh, before I met you
What was I??
...Just a lonely guy!
Beating at the start,
Now I know by heart
I became my self by caring for someone else

I'm growing more and more
Than I ever knew before
What a woman could do for a man

I LOVE Therefore I AM

Oh, before I met you
What was I??
Just a lonely guy
Beating at the start,
Now I know by heart
I became my self by caring for someone else

I'm growing more and more
Than I ever knew before
What I woman could do for a man

I LOVE, Honey, THEREFORE I AM (I am I am)
Listen to me baby
I LOVE, BABY THEREFORE I AM
Let me tell you one more time....---Lyrics submitted by Anita.
