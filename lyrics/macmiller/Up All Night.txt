Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Fill it up, fill it up!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

(Verse 1)
Let me get another cup please, I ain't driving home so you can have my keys
Gotta bunch of tricks all hidden in my sleeves,
So imma get drunk, won't be leaving 'till 3
Yeah I got a reputation, up getting wasted,
Everything is sight homie, we ain't trying to save shit,
Leave the spot dizzy, so nah I can't see bitch
Sexy bartenders always get a really mean tip
Life's so good: please enjoy it!
End of every night when your head's in the toilet
Yeah we party hard, give a fuck about employment
Kill the whole bottle we'll be spinning like a coin flip
Yeah, We ain't going home no time soon
I'm on shot #4 times 2
Stand by the keg, let the host find you
Getting nice, I'll be UP ALL NIGHT!

(Chorus)
Staying Up All Night!

I ain't got shit to do tomorrow (tomorrow)
We up all night
(4x's)
We gone, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!
'til we can't no more
We gone, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!
'til we can't no more

(Verse 2)
Head starts spinning and my legs get wobbly
Every morning wake up, liquor in my coffee
Yeah im trying to party, find an open house crib
Screw the law, we just some motha f***ing kids
Never listen to nobody who was trying to tell me "No"

Cause I got no problem being way out of control
Got these ladies going crazy at every single show
But you aint drunk enough until you taking of your clothes,
Not me, you can do you, do some crazy shit that's popping up on YouTube
Filling to rock out, I aint talking YouTube
Passing out, waking up without shoes
Live life on the edge, sharper than a razor
Like my liquor straight I don't ever need a chaser
Have a good time, aint a reason we should fight
Party with me we staying UP ALL NIGHT!

(chorus)
Staying Up All Night!

I ain't got shit to do tomorrow (tomorrow)
We up all night
(4x's)
We gone, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!
'til we can't no more
We gone, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!
'til we can't no more

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Fill it up, fill it up!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Fill it up, fill it up!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Fill it up, fill it up!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Fill it up, fill it up!
(2x's)
(chorus repeats)
Staying Up All Night!

I ain't got shit to do tomorrow (tomorrow)
We up all night
(4x's)

We gone, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!
'til we can't no more
We gone, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!
'til we can't no more
(4x's)
