I think I see where youre goin with this one E

[Verse 1:]
Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that
Still kick raps in cars and packs, so wheres my kids at?
These motherfuckers hatin sounded funnier than Sinbad
Im ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the assholes that she warned you about
We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that its wild
6:30 in the mornin and there still aint signs of slowin down
Twin sisters gettin wasted so they both are down
Its goin down, I thought I told you man
If you tryna to party let me see you raise your hand

[Hook:]
Theres a party on 5th ave (a party on 5th ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
Imma hump it and come runnin, cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you gotta
Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
Were just about there you choose
Were at the party on 5th ave tonight
And thats what Im tryna do

[Verse 2:]
Hey, whats the difference between me and you?
When no one believe in you, Im flyer than beetle juice
Don't count on the sheep to snooze,
I'm fucked up off weed and booze
I party and sleep til noon, what every day people do
Give me a week or two
See when you read the news my bitches don't sleep till noon
My rhyme time is why, my album is fly
Your favorite record, you gonna put it aside
This that old school shit soundin good in the ride
And fuck ten Im only countin to nine
Said this that old school shit, soundin good in the ride
Said lets head out to the party Ill drive

[Hook]

Whats goin on? Theres a party
Hope the neighbors dont mind us gettin loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gonna do that now

My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
My light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This aint a time to just sit back
Cause, theres a party on 5th ave
