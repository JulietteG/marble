She's been afraid to go out. She's afraid of the knock on her door.
There's always a shade of a doubt. She can never be sure.
Who comes to call? Maybe the friend of a friend of a friend, anyone at all.
Anything but nothing again.

It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too.
It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too.

Seems like even her old girlfriends might be talking her down.
She's got her name on the grapevine running up and down the telephone line.
Talking about someone said, someone said something about,
something else someone might have said about her.
She always figured that they were her friends but maybe they can live without her.

It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too.
It used to be her town, it used to be her town, too.

Well, people got used to seeing them both together.
But now he's gone and life goes on, nothing lasts forever, oh no.
She gets the house and the garden, he gets the boys in the band.
Some of them his friends, some of them her friends, some of them understand.
Lord knows that this is just a small town city, yes, and everyone can see you fall.
It's got nothing to do with pity, I just wanted to give you a call.

It used to be your town, it used to be my town, too.
You never know till it all falls down, somebody loves you, somebody loves you.
Darling, somebody still loves you.
I can still remember her when it used to be her town, too.
It used to be your town, it used to be my town, too... ---Lyrics submitted by jose lagrama.
