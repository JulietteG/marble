You sigh and say goodbye
And turn while I scratch out my eyes
What have I done this time
Nevermind last year
Never wanted to be
All of the things Im sure are me
Finally, I can see
You're to good for this
And I know im to late
Cause there's already nothing left to say
There's really nothing left to say
There's nothing left to say

Oh, if you only new
How often I thought of you
And how you would feel
You would smile for sure
So you can't be mad
When you don't get your sweater back
Cause it's the only part of you
That i can hold
And i know im too late
Cause there's already nothing left to say
There's really nothing left to say
There's nothing left to say

And i know im too late (oooh)
Cause there's nothing left to say
And at the end of  today, it's far too late
But I really never ever wanted it to come to this
Cause the final chapter, i never realized
That it truly was the end

Oooh, All I was trying to do
Was to have and not to hurt you
Couldn't bear to lose
My bestfriend again
And as you walk away
Please believe me when I say
That it ment everything
To me too
And I know im too late
Cause there's already nothing left to say
There's really nothing left to say
There's nothing left to say

There's nothing left to say---Lyrics submitted by angie.
