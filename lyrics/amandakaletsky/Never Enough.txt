Trying to find some soul of distraction to rest my head
I hope I can find some sort of illusion making me in the say
Why it seems always me?
how it gets to this point of no return.... no return
Its never enough... its never okay
to never been right, for you to treat me this way.
And I cant go on, living this way.
And I will not make the same mistakes.
So good ni8
Well I am gonna this time to find a solution
Im gotta keep this far away
I hope I can find some sore of recollusion for more and going to see
how it seems to always you
how it gets to this point of no return.... no return
Its never enough... its never okay
to never been right, for you to treat me this way.
And I cant go on, living this way.
And I will not make the same mistakes.
And try this for once try to see through my eyes
And try this for once try to let the past in
Its never enough..., its never had been right 
And I cant go on, living this way.
And I will not make the same mistakes.
So good ni8
Its never enough... its never okay
to never been right, for you to treat me this way.
And I cant go on, living this way.
And I will not make the same mistakes
So good ni8---Lyrics submitted by Juan Llerena Lpez.
