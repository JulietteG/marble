There's a hole in my heart
My soul is bleeding
I need to free my mind
And see what I'm feelin'
Cause lord knows
Lord knows
That I'm

Tired, tired of the way he treats me
Tired, tired of the guilty feelings
Tired, tired of the broken dreams
I'm tired, tired of the public scenes

I'm tired, tired of the baby mamas
Tired, tired of the ghetto drama
Tired, tired of the back and forth
I'm tired, tired of  in and out the courts

I'm tired, tired of all the games and lies
I'm tired, tired of phony alibis
I'm tired, tired of praying that it works
I'm tired, even tired of goin' to church

I'm tired, tired of payin' these bills
I'm tired, said I'm tired of keepin' it real
I'm tired, tired of cryin'
Tired, and I'm tired of smilin'

I'm tired, tired of all the haters
I'm tired, I'm tired of all players
I'm tired, I'm tired of the games, I'm so tired
Tired, 'cause it's about to drive me insane

Tired, and oh, I'm so tired of takin' it
Tired, said yeah, I'm so tired of fakin' it
Tired, 'cause you don't do it for me no more
Tired, you just don't do it no more

Tired, I'm tired of bein' wrong then doin' right
Tired, said I'm tired of keepin' peace in times of fighting
Tired, tired of letting go then holding on
Tired, tired of feelin' weak and bein' strong

Tired, so let me hear if you tired
Tired, gotta make some noise if you're tired
Tired, oh, throw 'em up if you're tired
Tired, wave your hands if you're tired, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Angela.
