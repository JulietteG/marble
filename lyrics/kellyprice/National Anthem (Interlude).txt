heres the day i've been waitin on
nfl on sunday morn
but u know we need to talk right now 
not rite now the tv is on
move out of da way da national anthem is coming on
if its the national anthem u want 
(baby let it wait)
here it here it 
(women if u dont go in there an get me my bib and leave me alone)
and i thought i made it clear
(please dont start dis again)
 told u to get her out of there
(but i told u she was just a friend)
came through ur house last nite 
and her bags were still there 
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
