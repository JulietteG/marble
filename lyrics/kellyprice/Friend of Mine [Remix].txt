[Kelly P.] see I was the one who picked her up when so called friends let her down

[Ron I.] uh-huh

[Kelly P.] and I was the one who took her in when that fool put her out, 
a true friend in deed

but she betrayed me
I caught her with him comin in from outta town

[chorus]
wh-y-y
wh-y-y
wh-y-y

[Kelly P.] Now I put my trust in him
I can't believe he slept with her behind my back
I went out on a limb
I even covered up to keep his thing in tact
What he had in me was sumthin real thats so hard to come about
But he betrayed me,
there was a photo and some laundry that I found 

tell me...

[chorus]
wh-y-y
wh-y-y
wh-y-y

[Kelly P.] I put all my trust in you baby,

[Ron I.] ohh wh-y-y

[Kelly P.] (She was) she was my best friend (through what eva, what eva)
roll with me through thick and thin (my homie, my homie)
sistahs to the very end, and I-I-I (can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it)

[Ron I.] So just call him up, 

[Kelly P.] No, I don't wanna, I don't wanna

[R. Kelly] Yeah but whats that..

[Ron I.] ...Wait a minute now you know all about heartache and pain,
this is my god daughter and I'm just tryin to protect her heart (don't waste your time)
you may have been a moon to her, but to me she's a star (why why why)
Kelly take this phone...

[Kelly P.] She was my best friend 
you were my husband
oh but I don't want you no no no mo, said I don't want you no no no no mo
