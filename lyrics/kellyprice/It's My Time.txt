Its my time to rise
Its my time to shine
Its my time to live
Its my time to fly
Its my time
Its my time

I can see it
I can feel it
Time has come now to refill it
Ive been waiting for a long time
I gotta do it
I wont let nothing hold me down
Gotta do it
Cause I might not get another chance
I believe it
That I want it, I can have it
I believe it
Got me falling,
[..] I can do it
I think Ill tell myself again
That I can do it
And I am not gonna stop till I win

Its my time to rise
Its my time to shine
Its my time to live (Its my time to live)
Its my time to fly
Its my time (time)
Its my time

she is a diva, yeah
she is a diva full of drama
Dont believe
Everything that people saying
They got you twisting
So much fiction, so much bad
They got you twisted
And nobody aint got time for that
See my moment has now arrived
And I wont let it pass behind
Its my time, yeah

Its my time to rise (oh, yeah)
Its my time to shine (ohh)
Its my time to live (my time to live)
Its my time to fly
Its my time
Its my time

I decided that I was born to be
Deep in love and happy
And my best days are still in front of me
Everything alright
Now, its time for me

Its my time to rise
Its my time to shine
Its my time to live (its my time to live)
Its my time to fly
Its my time
Its my time

Its my time to sing (its my time)
Its my time to see
Its my time to be
Its my time to show
Its my time (my time)
Its my time (Its my time to)

Its my time to rise (Its my time to rise )
Its my time to shine (Its my time to shine)
Its my time to live (its my time to live)
Its my time to fly
Its my time
