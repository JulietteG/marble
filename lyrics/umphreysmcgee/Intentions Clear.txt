you got my number, you can make the call.
'till then I won't bother you at all.
i'll let you walk all over me again,
but a smile is something I cannot pretend
and everytime I felt like this was wrong,
you made me feel like I should tag along.
and once or twice it would be nice to see,
even if I don't believe you, even if I don't believe
the lies, there will always be a time for you and me.
someone, something, someone, something, that leads.

[instrumental break]

i'll be hooked up, intentions clear
behind i've lost, behind the mirror, 
there'll be no wrong, there'll be no right
but this could be, a lonely night
which winter sets, the footprints fall
but i can't feel, nothing at all

I know it's wrong to make assumptions, 
but without them then I'm left with nothing
Im always focused on the fractions
i slowly understand what happens
i know you've got a lot of questions
but the answers aren't always the best things
and once or twice it would be nice to see
even if its bad for me to, even if I dont believe a lot
there will always be a time for you and me.
someone, something, someone, that means..

i'll be hooked up, intentions clear
behind i've lost, behind the mirror, 
there'll be no wrong, there'll be no right
but this could be, a lonely night
which winter sets, the footprints fall
but i can't feel, nothing at all---Lyrics submitted by Tim.
