Boys? on the window
Mail by the door
What would anybody leave so quickly for
Oh Ophelia,
where have you gone

Your neighborhood
It just ain't the same
Nobody knows just
What became of Ophelia
Tell me what went wrong

Was it something that somebody said
Honey, know we broke the rule
Was somebody up against the law
Honey, know I'd die for you

Ashes of laughter
The coast is clear
Why do the best things always disappear
Like Ophelia
Please knock at my door

Was it something that somebody said
What do you  know, we broke the rule
Was somebody up against the law
Honey, know I'd die for you

Wetting the whistles
Scared and running
And I'm still waiting for the second coming
of Ophelia
Come back home

Was it something that somebody said
Honey, know we broke the rules
Was somebody up against the law
What do you know, I'd die for you

They got your number
Scared and running
I'm still waiting for the second coming of Ophelia
Come back home---Lyrics submitted by Carmen.
