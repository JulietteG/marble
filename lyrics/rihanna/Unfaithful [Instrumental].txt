Story of my life
Searchin for the right
But it keeps avoiding me

Sorrow in my soul
Cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue

But the clouds are rolling in
Because i'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows i'm unfaithful 
And it kills him inside
To know that i'm happy
With some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
 everytime I walk out the door 
I see him die a litle more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be.....  murderer

I feel it in the air 
As i'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
He's here reluctantly
As if i'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls 
A lie I didn't have to tell
because we both know
where i'm about to go
and we know it very well

Cause I know that he knows i'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
To know that i'm happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Cause every time I walk out the door 
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be....... a murderer

Our love..... His trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this.......anymore


I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reasons why
cause every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be......... a murderer

 ohhhhhh... murderer
no,no,no yeah---Lyrics submitted by Malavika.
