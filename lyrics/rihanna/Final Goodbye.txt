I never should have waited so long to say
What i've always known since the very first day 
Thought that you would stya forever with me 
But the time have come too leave

Before we turn off da lights & close our eyes
I'll tell u a secret, i've held all my life 
Its you that i live for & for you I die 
So i'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye

Hold, draw me close, close to my lips 
Listen intently, as i tell you this 
Outside the world wages its wars 
I'll rest in peace as long as you know 

Before we turn out the lights & close our eyes 
I'll tell you a secret, I've held all my life 
It's you that i live for & for you i die 
So i'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye

Promise you our love will carry on 
Until you turn eternal, we belong

Before we turn out the lights & close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret, I've held all my life
It's you that i live for & for you i die 
So i'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye, goodbye---Lyrics submitted by RIGOBERTO.
