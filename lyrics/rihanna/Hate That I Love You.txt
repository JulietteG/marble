As much I love ya
as much I need ya
and I cant stand ya

Most everything you do
make me wana smile
can and I like ya for awile
but you want let me 
you upset me girl 
and then you kiss my lips 
all of a sudden I forget 
that I was upset 
cant remember what you did 
but I hate it 
you know exactly what to do 
so that I cant stay mad at you 
for too long thats wrong 
but I hate it 
you know exactly how to touch 
so that I dont wana  fall to fight no more 
so I despise that I adore you

And I hate how much I love you boy 
I cant stand how much I need ya 
and I hate how much I love you boy 
but I just cant let you go 
and I hate that I love you so

And you completely know 
the power that you have 
the only one that makes me laugh 
and its not fair 
how you take advantage of 
the fact that I 
love you beyond a reason why 
and it just aint right

And I hate how much I love you girl 
I cant stand how much I need you 
and I hate how much I love you girl 
but I just cant let you go 
but I hate that I love you so 

one of these days 
maybe your magic wont effect me 
and your kiss wont make me weak 
but no one in this world 
knows me the way you know me 
so youll probably always have a spell on me

As much I love ya 
as much I need ya 
as much I love ya 
as much I need ya---Lyrics submitted by MELISSA.
