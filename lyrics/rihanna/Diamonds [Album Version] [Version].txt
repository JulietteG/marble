Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
Were like diamonds in the sky

Youre a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, Im alive
Were like diamonds in the sky

I knew that wed become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I left the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight you and I
Were beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
Were beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
Were beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond.---Lyrics submitted by giorgi.
