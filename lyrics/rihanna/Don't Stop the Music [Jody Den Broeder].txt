Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music 
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music

It's gettin late
I'm makin my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body movin shake the stress away
I wasn't lookin for nobody when you looked my way
Possible canidate yeah

Who knew that you'd be up in here lookin like you do
You're makin satayin over here impossible
Baby Imma say your aura is incredible if you don't 
have to go don't

[Bridge]
Do you know what you, started i just came here to party
But now we're rockin on the dance floor actin naughty
Your hands around my waist, just let the music play
We're hand in hand,chest to chest,and now we're face to face

[Chorus]
I wanna take you away,let's escape into the music DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it,Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin to it
Please don't stop the,please don't stop, please don't stop the music
(repeat)

Baby are you ready cause it's gettin cold
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode
What goes on between us know one has to know
this is a private show, Oh

[Bridge]
[Chorus]repeat
