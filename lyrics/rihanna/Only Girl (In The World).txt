La la la la
La la la la
La la la la


I want you to love me, like Im a hot guy
Keep thinkin of me, doin what you like
So boy forget about the world cuz its gon be me and you tonight
I wanna make your bed for ya, then imma make you swallow your pride


Want you to make me feel like Im the only girl in the world
Like Im the only one that youll ever love
Like Im the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like Im the only one thats in command
Cuz Im the only one who understands how to make you feel like a man
Want you to make me feel like Im the only girl in the world
Like Im the only one that youll ever love
Like Im the only one who knows your heart
Only one


Want you to take me like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow, make me feel right
Baby Ill tell you all my secrets that Im keepin, you can come inside
And when you enter, you aint leavin, be my prisoner for the night


Want you to make me feel like Im the only girl in the world
Like Im the only one that youll ever love
Like Im the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like Im the only one thats in command
Cuz Im the only one who understands, like Im the only one who knows your heart, only one


Take me for a ride
Oh baby, take me high
Let me make you first
Oh make it last all night
Take me for a ride
Oh baby, take me high
Let me make you first
Make it last all night


Want you to make me feel like Im the only girl in the world
Like Im the only one that youll ever love
Like Im the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like Im the only one thats in command
Cuz Im the only one who understands how to make you feel like a man
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
