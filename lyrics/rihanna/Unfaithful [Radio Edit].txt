Story of my life
Searching for the right 
But it keeps avoiding me 
Sorrow in my soul 
'Cause it seems that wrong 
Really loves  my company
He's more than a man 
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rollin' in
Because I'm gone again

And to him I just can't be true
And I know that I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know i am happy with some other guy
I can see him dyin'
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna take away his life 
I dont wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air 
As i doin' my hair
Preparing for another day
A kiss upon my check 
He's here reluctantly
As if i'm gonna be out late
I say i won't be long
Just hangin' with the girls
A lie i didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where i'm about to go 
and we know very well

'Cause I know that he know I'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dyin'
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
i don't wanna be a murderer

Our Love,His Trust
I might as well taken a gun
And put it to his head 
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this 
Anymore Ooooh
Anymore, I don't wanna do this
Anymore I don't wanna to be the reason why
And everytime I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer Ooooh
A murderer
No No No 
Yeah Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Renee.
