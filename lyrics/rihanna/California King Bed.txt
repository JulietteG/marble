Chest to chest. 
Nose to Nose.
Palm to palm. 

We were always just that close. 
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose. 

So how come when i reach out my finger. 
It feels like more then distance between us.

In this california king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. 
I been california wishing on these stars for your heart, for me. My california king.

Eye to eye, cheek to cheek, side by side. 
You were sleeping next to me. 
Arm in arm, dusk to dawn. 
With the curtains drawn.
And a little last night on these sheets.

So how come when i reach out my fingers. 
It feels like more then distance between us..........
In this california king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. 
I been california wishing on these stars for your heart, for me. My california king.

Just when i felt like giving up on us. 
You turned around and give me one last touch.
That made everything feel better.
And even then my eyes got wetter.
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But i don't wanna seems so weak.
Maybe I've been california dreaming.

In this california king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. 
I've been california wishing on these stars for your heart, for me. My california king.

My california king. 

In this california king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. 
I been california wishing on these stars for your heart, for me. My california king.---Lyrics submitted by angelina.
