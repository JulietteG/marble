Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out

Strip clubs and dollar bills
I still got my money
Patron shots, can I get a refill
I still got my money
Strippers going up and down that pole
And I still got my money
Four o clock and we aint going home
Cause I still got my money
Money make the world go around
I still got my money
Bandz make your girl go down
And I still got my money
Lot mo' where dat came from
I still got my money
The minute you wise, you know you want some
I still got my money

Ohhhh

All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhhh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out

Valet cost a hundred bills
I still got my money
Gold all up in my grill
I still got my money
Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got my money
Call J up and close a deal
I still got my money
My fragance on and they love my smell
I still got my money
So who cares about what I spend
I still got my money
My pocket's deep, and they never end
I still got my money
I'm going dumb with all my friends
I still got my money

Ohhh all I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhhh money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out---Lyrics submitted by Janee Mcgary.
