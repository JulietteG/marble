Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I never know
(Oh, oh)
Shadows chase me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold
(Oh, oh)
And you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth
My soul

Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust
(Oh, oh)
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays
(Oh, oh)
Don't you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth
My soul

Where you gonna go, where you gonna go
Where you gonna run to
When you get to the edge of the night?
It's time you face the sky, ooh

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you---
