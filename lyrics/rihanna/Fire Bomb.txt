Yeah 
Whoa 
Gunfire left a hole 
in the tank 
losing gasoline

Fire is on my trail 
And hes after me 
Hope it dont get here 
Before I get where Im going 
I gotta get where Im going 
Take off my mask to breath 

You couldve been a apart of a 
Masterpiece 
Fluid in the breaks 
Was the last to leak
Thats the thing 

Where I'm going 
I dont need my breaks 
Cant wait to see your face 
When your front windows break 
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road 
Oh, oh, oh 
Cause this thing is ready to blow 
Oh, oh, oh 

I just wanna set you on fire 
So I dont have to burn alone 
Then you 
Then youll know where 
I'm coming from 
Fire bomb 
Fire bomb 

Seats go 
But baby no 
Doesnt have to be 
Like the way that I'm at 
A tragedy 
Watching it burning 
Its beautiful and its blue 
And its pitiful
And its blue as the other half of me
Its the other half of me

I didnt do it 
You lit the match from me 
Now were flying 
From the blast, baby 
Thats the thing 

Where we're going 
We dont need no breaks 
Cant wait to see your face 
When your front windows break 
And I come crashing through 

The lovers need to clear the road 
Oh, oh, oh 
Cause this thing is ready to blow 
Oh, oh, oh 

I just wanna set you on fire 
So I dont have to burn alone 
Then you 
Then youll know where 
Im coming from 
Fire bomb 
Fire bomb

Baby we were killing them 
They couldnt handle the millionth degree 
We were criminals 
As we were burning 
The world called the police 
Fire department, ambulance 
You can call me crazy cause I believe 
The only move for me and you 
Is to blow our flames 
And 

The lovers need to clear the road 
Oh, oh, oh 
Cause this thing is ready to blow 
Oh, oh, oh 

I just wanna set you on fire 
So I dont have to burn alone 
Then you 
Then youll know where 
Im coming from 
Fire bomb 
Oh, oh, oh 
Fire bomb---Lyrics submitted by Nichol.
