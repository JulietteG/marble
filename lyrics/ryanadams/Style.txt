Midnight, you come and pick me up with no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view
It's been a while since I even heard from you
I should just tell you you should leave
I know exactly where it leads
Watch us go around, 'round each time

You've got that Daydream Nation look in your eye
I got that pent up love thing that you like
And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes, I can't keep my eyes on the road
She takes me home, lights are off, she's taking off her coat
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with someone new, someone new, someone new"
She says "What you heard is true
I can't stop thinking about you"
And I've been there far too many times

You've got that Daydream Nation look in your eye
I got that pent up love thing that you like
And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long brown hair thing that I like
You've got that good girl faith and ass so tight
And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style---
