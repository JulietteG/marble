Sunlight falls on your hands as you type,
Just something in my head.
Standing in this empty space,
Your desk is gone,
The wall's still dark from where it went.

This position is not open now for applicants.
The application forms got shredded.
There was faulty wordin' in the documents.
I can still hear you laughin',
Coming up the rickety stairs,
Laughin' as the springtime filled your lungs with air.
Pink smoke rung out like the patches of your hair
Like violets
Like birds inside a bell

A grey ghost prowls in the back of my mind
While the sun is out,
Though it's still up and the light is shining.
Its seasons push and pull enough to get us through
For my mind is open now
But it won't let the door open to an empty room

This position is not open now for applicants.
The application forms got shredded.
There was faulty wordin' in the documents.
I can still hear you laughin',
Coming up the rickety stairs,
Laughin' as the springtime filled your lungs with air.
Pink smoke rung out like the patches of your hair
Like violets
Like birds inside a bell

If somehow I'd have known
I would have rather gone down with the ship
Than be without you
If only for the chance
To hold you hand,
To be your friend

I'm never gonna last
I - I would have rather gone down
Than this

The war is over
The war is over
War is over
And I'm waiting in the sinking ship

If only I had known
If only I had known---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
