I was waitin' around for somebody to die.
Nobody did, but a part of me died,
I suppose from all that waiting
These things, they pass in time
But the moments get real and it's hard sometimes.
I think of someone that I'd like to be
And I hold that in my mind.
But there's always tonight
Tonight

And you, you make me feel like I'm here when I'm not
And it, it makes me feel like I'm not here
You, you make me feel like I'm not here
But I am, I am
More than you think I am

Take a picture of your life; now freeze it.
Hold it there a second and just look at the screen.
What parts of you were illusions and daydreams?
These things, they pass in time,
But the moments get real and it's hard sometimes.
Moving in time to the music rolling in your mind
And when you stay home tonight
Become your home.

And you, you make feel like I'm here when I'm not here
And it, it makes me feel like I'm not here
You, you make me feel like I'm not here
And I am, I am
More than you think I am
I am, I am
More than you think I am

You make me feel like a natural ghost
You make me feel like a natural ghost
You make me feel like a natural ghost
You make me feel like a natural ghost---Lyrics submitted by Lyrics.com.
