We belong here, we belong here
Aint nobody that can tell us were wrong
Help me say, say this to you
Ill stand by your side, to see you through

I promise you that Ill keep you safe from harm
Ill love you all the rest of my days
When the night is silent and we seem so far away
Oh I love you but I dont know what to say

I was lost, I was lost
Tried to find the balance, got caught up in the cost
Let it go, when I met you
All the clouds parted, all that light came shining through

I promise you I will keep you safe from harm
And love you all the rest of my days
When the night is silent and we seem so far away
Oh I love you and I dont know what to say

I promise you that I will keep you safe from harm
And love you all the rest of my days
When the night is silent and we seem so far away
Oh I love you and I dont know what to say
Oh I love you and I dont know what to say ---Lyrics submitted by Glen Lopez.
