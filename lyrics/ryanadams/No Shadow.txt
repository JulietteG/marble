The veil is lifted
And the sun is on the rise
This machine ain't workin'
You got to kick it on sight
Kick it on sight

If you think youre stronger than this
Youre wrong
I am with you, you are safe
And you will always belong

So many faces in our pockets so slow down
Repeat this, until tomorrow
Wear a new disguise when you come around
When you come around

If you think youre stronger than this
Youre wrong
I am with you, you are safe
And you will always belong

Life is a birdsong
Life is a birdsong
Life is a birdsong
What am I to you?
What am I to you?
No shadow, no shadow
What am I to you?
What am I to you?
No shadow, no shadow

The veil is lifted
And the sun is on the rise
This machine ain't workin'
You got to kick it on sight---
