I am just staring
At the moon
Like it was yesterday
See my face reflecting
In the lights
In the window
In the window pane
Trees outside and hills
With a belly full
Of sleeping pills
With a little less pain

I'm just sitting
In the sun
Watching boats go by
Chains locked
Fast to the pier
In the bottom
Of the boat
There's a picture
Of a family
Older
Than their years

I saw time come
And I saw time go
Like the light
On the blackening
Oceanside

Oh
It doesn't feel
Like yesterday
Like yesterday---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
