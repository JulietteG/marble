What makes them walk away, after all these years?
These years are burning in the hard way by the lessons from the tears
I know it's not a game
But it feels like losing when someone you love throws you away
i'd fix it
i'd fix it
i'd fix it
i'd fix it if I could
And i'd always win
i'd always win
So you can always win the in end

How easy was it for you making those plans you made?
Before I became someone for you you know to try to dislocate
But, I know it's not a game
But if feels like losing when someone you love gets up and walks away
i'd fix it
i'd fix it
i'd fix it
i'd fix it if I could
And i'd always win
i'd always win
And you?d always lose

Look what I did to you
Look what you did to me
Fixed it
i'd fix it, id fix it if I could
And i'd always win
i'd always win
i'd always win in the end---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
