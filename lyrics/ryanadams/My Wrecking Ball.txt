Driving through the streets tonight
It's hot, I got the windows down
I wish I could call you, I wish you were still around

Nothing much left in the tank
Somehow this thing still drives
Get forgot what it needed but somehow still survives
And all the walls we build, they must come down

Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight

Lying in my bed tonight, feeling like I'm somebody else
My thoughts inside my head get lost inside the haunted house
Everyone I used to know left their dreams by the door
I accidentally kick them, that's how I can tell you're still not sure
And all the walls we build, they rise and they fall

But hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and maybe knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight

Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight

Driving through the streets tonight
It's hot, I got the windows down
I wish I could call you, I wish you were still around---
