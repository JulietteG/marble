Now the flame is out
but the light burns on
No one ever said he was bigger than his song.
So few ever knew
the heart inside the man
but he gave himself away as only poets can.
He took the stories of his people
Gave them back in rhyme
But for the pleasures of the heart
there was never enough time
He said one day hed quit
then he would come home.
But there was always one more stage
always one more road.


The candles burning at both ends
Burning in the middle
Theres no time to stop between the guitar and the fiddle
A  crazy tune, a crazy time
You know the words were true
Smiles lift their eyes
But all he ever saw was you.

(Instrumental pause)

The road finally claimed him
like a sailor lost at sea
Setting sail on the horizon
would not let him be.
Following a star drew him like a flame
though he loved you so well
he was not the same.
Candles burning at both ends
Burning in the middle
Theres no time to stop between the guitar and the fiddle

A crazy tune, a crazy time
You know the words were true
Smiles lift their eyes
But all he ever saw was you.---Lyrics submitted by Valerie Grimes.
