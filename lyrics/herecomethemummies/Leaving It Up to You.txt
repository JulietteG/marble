do do doo
do do doo
do do doo
do do doot do do doo

You've got secrets
You're not saying a word
I can't describe
Just how much that hurts

I thought our love
Was honest and true
You're guilty baby
And your silence is proof

ahh ahh ahh ahh

How can I read your mind

ahh ahh ahh ahh

Have we been livin' a lie
ahh ahh ahh ahh

It's not up to me this time
I'm leavin' it up to you baby
I'm leavin' it up to you girl
I'm leavin' it up to you baby
Don't you tear apart my world

I'm leavin' it up to you baby
I'm leavin' it up to you girl

And I just can't believe
That you're deceiving me

do do doo
do do doo
do do doo
do do doot do do doo

You come home
looking like you've been caught in the rain
Smelling like cologne
When it ain't rained for days

(high karate)

Time after time
I say this can't get much worse
You got cheating in your eyes girl
And your drawers in your purse

ahh ahh ahh ahh

How can I read your mind

ahh ahh ahh ahh

Have we been living a lie

ahh ahh ahh ahh

It's not up to me this time
I'm leavin' it up to you baby
I'm leavin' it up to you girl
I'm leavin' it up to you baby
Don't you tear apart my world

'm leavin' it up to you baby
I'm leavin' it up to you girl

And I just can't believe
That you're deceiving me

Oh no

Yeah 'cuz I'm leavin' it up to you baby
I'm leavin' it up to you girl
I'm leavin' it up to you baby
Don't you, don't you tear apart my world

'm leavin' it up to you baby
I'm leavin' it up to you girl

And I just can't believe
That you're deceiving me

Oh no

Oh no

You've got something on the side, 
something on the side, 
something on the side---Lyrics submitted by Keeley.
