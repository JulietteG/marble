Tip toe down to the basement
Sneak around
Tip toe down where she's waiting

Tip toe down to the basement
Sneak around
Tip toe down where she's waiting

She's too young to be my lover
She's too old to be discovered

Don't want to wake her daddy up

I should stay away
I should know much better
I should stay at home
I should've known the danger

Tip toe down to the basement
Sneak around
Tip toe down where she's waiting

Tip toe down to the basement
Sneak around
Tip toe down where she's waiting

I should stay away
I should've known the danger
I should stay at home
I should know much better

Tip toe down to the basement
Sneak around
Tip toe down where she's waiting

Tip toe down to the basement
Sneak around
Tip toe down where she's waiting

She's too young to be my lover
She's too old to be discovered

Don't want to wake her daddy up---Lyrics submitted by Keeley.
