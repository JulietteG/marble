You know those jealous eyes
Do the walk of shame
They're the ones that criticize
Do the walk of shame

It ain't so bad
To do what you've done
We all pay a price to have a little fun

Do the walk
Do the walk 
Do the walk
Do the walk of shame

We all got this primal need
Do the walk of shame
Put on some dignity
Do the walk of shame

You take the credit baby
I'll take the blame
I know you've been here before
'Cuz you know how to do that thing

Do the walk
Do the walk 
Do the walk
Do the walk of shame

Go ahead and hit your stride for all your friends to see
It happens every friday night since that first night in your dormitory
Why you acting so embarrassed
When you know damn well what the well worn path is

You know those jealous eyes
Do the walk of shame
They're the ones that criticize
Do the walk of shame

It ain't so bad
To do what you've done
We all pay a price to have a little fun

Do the walk
Do the walk 
Do the walk
Do the walk of shame

Go ahead and hit your stride for all your friends to see
It happens every friday night since that first night in your dormitory
Why you acting so embarrassed
When you know damn well what the well worn path is

We all got this primal need
Do the walk of shame
Put on some dignity
Do the walk of shame

You take the credit baby
I'll take the blame
I know you've been here before
'Cuz you know how to do that thing

Do the walk
Do the walk 
Do the walk
Do the walk of shame

Do the walk
Do the walk 
Do the walk
Do the walk of shame

Do the walk
Do the walk 
Do the walk
Do the walk of shame---Lyrics submitted by Keeley.
