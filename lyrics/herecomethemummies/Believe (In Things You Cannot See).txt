Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhhhh x3

Chorus:
Do you believe in things you cannot see
Do you take your superstition seriously
Can you deny the magic with you and me
Do you believe in things you cannot see

Let your inhibitions fly away
in the wind
Can't you feel the heat around your soul
it's not a sin

Chorus

I can turn your sorrow, hurt, and pain
into love
If you lose your faith your heart will change
into dust

Chorus

Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhhh

Don't cross a black cat in the alley after midnight

Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhhh (do you believe)x5

Throw the salt over your shoulder underneath the ladder

Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhhh (do you believe)x5

Step on a crack 
break your mummy's back

Chorus x3

Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhhh

Don't cross a black cat in the alley after midnight

Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhhh (do you believe)x5

Throw the salt over your shoulder 

Do you believe in things you cannot see
Do you take your superstition seriously
Can you deny the magic with you and me
Do you believe in things---Lyrics submitted by Keeley.
