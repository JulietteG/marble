Ahh whatcha say
Ahh whatcha say
Ahh whatcha say

My Queen sits high on her throne
I built with my two hands
When the King goes out at night alone
She calls her back door man

(and I got a key)

I'm gonna build a temple
But i'm better in a bunk
Late at night she calls me 
to electrify the funk

I said a Queen 
she grooves me
all night long
My funky little baby

I said a Queen 
she grooves me
all night long
My funky little baby

Ahh whatcha say

She's got her King for the money
and me for the show
I'm her number one servant
and i'm always good to go, go

That fat cat's always lazy
He don't keep her satisfied
I'm slim, trim, and tremblin'
and shady on the side

I said my queen
she grooves me
all night long
my funky little baby

i said come here boy
Come hither 
Come hither

She said come here boy
Come hither 
Come hither

I said come here boy

That fat cat's always lazy
He don't keep her satisfied
I'm slim, trim, and tremblin'
and shady on the side

I said a Queen 
she grooves me
all night long
My funky little baby

I said a Queen 
she grooves me
all night long
My funky little baby

I said a Queen 
she grooves me
all night long
My funky little baby

I said a Queen 
she grooves me
all night long
My funky little baby
