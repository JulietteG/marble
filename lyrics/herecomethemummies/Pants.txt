Monday, Tuesday, Hump-day is halfway

Stick it in the pig
Pop it in the bank
Saturday's comin' quicker than you think

48 to rendezvous 
I'm gonna blow a wad on you

Oh oh oh

I'm comin' in my pants, 
my shirt, in my best suit baby
Gonna pick your flower
Gonna be there in an hour

I'm comin' in my pants,
shines shoes, and my necktie honey
I'm so excited
I hope that I don't come to soon

I can't move on
Attention is long gone

Suits all pressed
My wallet's in shape
Only thing left 
Is a little man-scape

24 to rendezvous
I'm gonna blow a wad on you

I'm comin' in my pants, 
my shirt, in my best suit baby
Gonna pick your flower
Gonna be there in an hour

I'm comin' in my pants,
shines shoes, and my necktie honey
I'm so excited
I hope that I don't come to soon

24 to rendezvous
I'm gonna blow a wad on you

24 to rendezvous
I'm gonna blow a wad on you

'm comin' in my pants, 
my shirt, in my best suit baby
Gonna pick your flower
Gonna be there in an hour

I'm comin' in my pants,
shines shoes, and my necktie honey
I'm so excited

'm comin' in my pants, 
my shirt, in my best suit baby
Gonna pick your flower
Gonna be there in an hour

I'm comin' in my pants,
shines shoes, and my necktie honey
I'm so excited

I can't wait
I can't wait

I'm so excited

I can't wait 
I can't wait

I hope that I don't come to soon---Lyrics submitted by Keeley.
