When I learned that I had a brother 
I made up a dance for you 
We'd be crime fighters together 
And do things that brothers do 

When you told me about his mother 
And all that she'd been through 
What could I do 

You got it wrong but I love you 
You're kinda rough but I love you 
We get along and I love you 
You know you know you know I love you 

When I learned I had a sister 
I pretended to hate her 
I'd seen it on TV 
I knew exactly what to do 

When I found it out 
That she had her very own daughter 
What could I do 

You're kinda sad but I love you 
You're kinda rough but I love you 
We get along and I love you 
You know you know you know I love you 

We've got a bloodline passing through our sight lines 
We've got a bloodline man I gotta find mine 

I love you, I love you, I tell you that I love you 
I need you, I love you, I really really love you 

I love you, I love you, I tell you that I love you 
I need you, I love you, I really really love you 

I love you, I love you, I tell you that I love you 
I need you, I love you, I really really love you 

I love you, I love you, I tell you that I love you 
I need you, I love you, I really really love you 

You're kinda sad but I love you 
You're kinda rough but I love you 
Maybe you're broke but I love you 
I know it's stupid but I love you 

You got a bad sense of humour. 
A little rough around the edges 
You're kinda soft in the middle 
You love those boring instrumentals 

I never see you but I love you 
We get along and I love you 
You are my blood so I love you 
You know you know you know I love you 

You know you know you know I love you 
You know you know you know I love you 
You know you know you know I love you 
You know you know you know I love you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
