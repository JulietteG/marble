All my life, I've been loved
and never been lost, never been haunted
by more than this, never enough.
I've never wanted more than this.

I look at the moon, I look at the stars,
sun on my back, sun on my back.
Never too far, never too soon,
I'm summer and June.

This season, this year, same as the last year,
first snow in November, first snap in the night.
All my heart is joy in the light,
grateful to remember Christmas in December.---Lyrics submitted by Jordan Price.
