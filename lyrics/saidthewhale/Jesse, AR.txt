Jesse came from Arkansas 
Had a house and sold it off 
Been a husband for too long 
Never been a lover, though 

So he headed up to Edmonton 
He changed his name and found some friends 
Got a couple shekels from a brother who supported him 

Didn't take a couple months 
Till Jesse finally met someone 
A simple girl from Edmonton 
Thought that they could be something 

So he brought her back to Little Rock 
And showed her off to everyone 
Found a house and found a job 
Got a ring to get it done 

Restless eyes they never sleep for too long they're always a couple steps ahead 

Jesse disappeared again 
Didn't go to Edmonton 
Didn't talk to any friends 
Like many others who are 
Trying to be someone else 
Instead of who they really are 

Jesse came from Arkansas 
Had a house and sold it off 
Been a husband for too long 
Never been a lucky one---Lyrics submitted by mitch stewart.
