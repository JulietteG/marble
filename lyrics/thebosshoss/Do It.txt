You gotta do it - what you're talking about
i said do it - without any doubt
you gotta do it - if you think it's alright
i said do it - no fuss no fight
do it - and if they tell you not, still do it
you only got one shot
you gotta kick butt, give all you got
turn on, tune in, it's all your show
alright fight!
you don't need a master plan,
just do it, baby oh yes you can
do it man - hot damn!

set your love on fire
and let the flames burn higher - so set fire
to your heart, to your soul, to your mind
let it shine
to your dream, your everything
it's your flame of fame
so set your love on fire

you gotta do it - take the money and run
quit your job and have fun
live, love, kiss and tell
party on, till the break of dawn
and when they tell you stop - stick do it
whether they dig it or not
put your big foot down, you're wearing the crown,
you gotta go go baby go burn it down!
do it ma'am, hot damn

set your love on fire
and let the flames burn higher - so set fire
to your heart, to your soul, to your mind
let it shine
to your dream, your everything
it's your flame of fame
so set your love on fire

no can do - if it sucks, you can do if it rocks
no can do - if you're not in the flow no go
do it - things that you adore
do it - you would die for
do it - ma'am
do it - damn!

set your love on fire
and let the flames burn higher - higher
set your love on fire
and let the flames burn higher - so set fire
to your heart, to your soul, to your mind
let it shine
to your dream, your everything
it's your flame of fame
so set your love on fire---
