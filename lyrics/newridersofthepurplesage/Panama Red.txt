Panama Red,... Panama Red      
He'll steal your woman then he'll rob your head
Panama Red,....Panama Red
On his white horse, Mescolito, he comes breezin' through town,
Bet your woman is up in bed with ol' Panama Red

The judges don't know when Red's in town,
He keeps well hidden under ground,
Everbody's acting lazy, falling out, or hanging 'round
My woman say's "Hey Pedro, you're acting crazy like a clown",
Nobody feels like working, Panama Red is back in town

Panama Red,... Panama Red      
He'll steal your woman then he'll rob your head
Panama Red,....Panama Red
On his white horse, Mescolito, he comes breezin' through town,
Bet your woman is up in bed with ol' Panama Red

Everbody's looking out for him because they know Red satisfies,
Little girls like to listen to him sing and tell sweet lies,
But when things get too confusing,
Honey, we're better off in bed,
I'll be searching all the joints in town for .... Panama Red

Panama Red,... Panama Red      
He'll steal your woman then he'll rob your head
Panama Red,....Panama Red
On his white horse, Mescolito, he comes breezin' through town,
Bet your woman is up in bed with ol' Panama Red

Panama Red,... Panama Red      
He'll steal your woman then he'll rob your head
Panama Red,....Panama Red
On his white horse, Mescolito, he comes breezin' through town,
Bet your woman is up in bed with ol' Panama Red

Panama Red,... Panama Red
