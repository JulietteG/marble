Was alone then along came Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
Was amazed when she stole my thunder
Filled my world with the ways of wonder

Come away come away with me
Far away where the eyes can't see
Come away to another time
Pardon if you lose your mind

Who are you now?
Who makes the rules?
Follow your heart and get back....
Won't you get back....
Oh get back

Was alone then along came Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
Was amazed when she stole my thunder
Filled my world with the ways of wonder

Come away come away with me
Far away where the eyes can't see
Come away to another time
Pardon if you lose your mind
Pardon if you lose your mind
Pardon if you lose your mind-if you lose your mind---Lyrics submitted by Celine.
