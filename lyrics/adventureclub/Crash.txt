I try my best just to get away
but you pulled me closer
you're something wild i can never tame
and you're taking over
all my thoughts and the words are same
never seem to matter
you're the drug running through my veins
and the crash right after

never thought i would be okay
when the pain took over
a disease moving through my brain
makes my vision slower
try and run but i can't escape
as my whole world shatters
you're the drug running through my veins
and the crash right after---Lyrics submitted by Shortfatnhappy.
