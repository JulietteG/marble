It was raised in the sunshine city
In the middle of sex, drugs, girls that's pretty
Guess I made a left down the right down route
If I made a right they couldn't have pulled me out
As I take a look down the projects blocks
See they filled with pain and I'ma block that out
Cause I got a job to protect and serve
And I'm gon do it, homie, that's my word

But I'm your badge but I'm your gun
And all my niggas told me that I was on one
I guess it was something in my heart that told me
Cause when I was young I used to hate the police
But this is my calling that's my take
I never would've thought end up as Jake
But I'm do my best just to keep my brain
Cause in this city homies it's hard to stay sane

As I walk the line
The city is mine
Just don't cross the line
The city is mine
As I walk the line
The city is mine
Just don't cross the line

Welcome to Miami where the killers dwell
And I specialize in putting them in a jail cell
I give a holler	to my sisters on welfare
Please don't hate me for the badge I ware
Please don't hate me cause your man ain't there
I tried to warn him, he ain't care
It's a dirty job and somebody gotta do it 
Got to make sure your kids safe at school

But I'm your badge but I'm your gun
I got a bad attitude so you better run
I'm about to clean the streets
And I sweep'em if I have to
You got guns, we got guns too
And I bet we got mo' guns than you 
A message from Miami's finest don't sleep
If we catch yo ass on the creep
We gon' take the dope, the money and leave a case you can't beat
C'mon!

As I walk the line
The city is mine
Just don't cross the line
The city is mine
As I walk the line
The city is mine
Just don't cross the line

The city is mine
(Don't you try, the city is mine)

As I walk the line
The city is mine
Just don't cross the line
The city is mine---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
