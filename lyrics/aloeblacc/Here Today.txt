I'm a long lost wondering soul trying to find where I belong (woah)
And I'm looking for a place where it feels alright to be wrong (yeah)
Just a loud-mouth, hard-headed, fool-hearted, stubborn-nose, song-of-a-gun (woah)
Chip off the ole' block with a chip on my shoulder that weighs a ton

All I know for sure is that nothing is forever
And all that matters is how we get along together
Life is harder every day that I get older
I hope I figure out why I'm here before it's over

Cuz we're here today (hey!), and gone tomorrow
We're here today (hey!), and gone tomorrow
Lead the way (hey!), never follow
Here today (hey!), and gone tomorrow

I've been stuck at home alone on nights when no one calls (woah)
And I've had nights where I could take my pick or have 'em all (yeah)
And I've had those days where I search my pockets for a nickel and a dime (woah)
And I've had those days where trying to make money was a waste of my time

I've had shiny brand new leather penny loafers
And I've had torn-up, soiled teddys handed-over
All I know for sure is that nothing is forever
And all that matters is how we get along together

Cuz we're here today (hey!), and gone tomorrow
We're here today (hey!), and gone tomorrow
Through the joy (hey!), and the sorrow
We're here today (hey!), and gone tomorrow

We aint promised tomorrow, so I'm gonna live for today
Been from five star hotels to cockroach motels
And Rodeo Drive retail to thrift store resale
I've had chauffeured town cars to an old broken-down car
It aint what happens to you, it's what you do about it

Cuz we're here today (hey!), and gone tomorrow
Here today (hey!), and gone tomorrow
Lead the way (hey!), never follow
Here today (hey!), and gone tomorrow

Here today (hey!) [x4]---
