[Verse 1:]
Grab your shotgun
Cock it back
Shoot the sun until the sky is black
Now I don't know if the sun got rhythm
But he gone dance when that music hit'm
Bang, bang, bang darkness falls
In the nighttime I'm camouflage

[Pre-Chorus:]
Now I-I-I-I, don't know who you are
But girl I wanna know if you can move like this
And I-I-I-I, don't know if you gonna tell me
But I wanna know what your name is
And you-you-you-you
Gonna make me fall in love with you
If you keep on shaking your hips

[Chorus:]
Now can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
Can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
Can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
Can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
I know you think that you can move
But can you groove the way I groove

[Verse 2:]
Grab your slingshot
Find a stone
Shoot the moon until the night is gone
I sure hope that moon got rhythm
Cuz he gone rock and when my stone hit'm
Boom, boom, boom let me shine
He should know that the day is mine

[Chorus:]
Now can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
Can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
Can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
Can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
I know you think that you can move
But can you groove the way I groove

[Break:]
Do you wanna dance
Cuz I wanna dance with you
Do you wanna dance
Come along and dance with me

[Bridge:]
Can you do this
(Can you do this baby)
Can you do this
(Can yo move like I do)
Can you do this
(Can you shake it shake it mama)
Can you do this
(Can you break it on down)

[Chorus:]
Now can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
Can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
Can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
Can you do this
(Yeah, I can do that)
I know you think that you can move
But can you groove the way I groove ---
