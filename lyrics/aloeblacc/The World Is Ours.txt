From the sky to the sea to the air that we breathe
From the depths of the earth to the stars

(Light up the earth, light up the earth)

Live like you're born to fly
Live like you'll never die
Dare what you dare to dream
And everything in between

I had an epiphany one night,
looking at the endless star filled sky
The world is ours!
The world is ours!
The world is ours!
(We are we are we are we are)
The world is ours!

Sing out your bed and cry under the stage and sky
Oceans and land divide, united we feel inside

The world is ours!
The world is ours!
The world is ours!
The world is ours!
The world is ours!
The world is ours!

(We are we are we are we are)

The world is ours!
(Light up the world, light up the world)---
