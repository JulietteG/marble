The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep yo calm, carry on
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb

Sun may never rise again
The question ain't if but when
Sea will mourn and the sky will fall
The sun may never rise again
The silent war has begun
The staring down loaded gun
No refuge found no solid ground
Assuming race can't be one
Don't wait to say goodbye, you're running out of time
Whatever you believe it's easy to see

The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep yo calm, carry on
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
And it's about to explode
The whole world, the whole world
The whole world, the whole world

My future is dying
Laying in a ditch in the dark
I need you here but all I hear
Is the beating of a broken heart
Don't wait to say goodbye, you're running out of time
Whatever you believe it's easy to see

The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
So keep yo calm, carry on
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
And it's about to explode
The whole world, the whole world
The whole world, the whole world
And it's about to explode
The whole world, the whole world
The whole world, the whole world
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
And it don't care what side you're on
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb
The whole world, the whole world
The whole world, the whole world
So keep yo calm, carry on
The whole world sitting on a ticking bomb---
