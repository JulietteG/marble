This is the moment of a lifetime
Made it through the dark; now it's time to let your light shine
When the story could end, the glory and it's yours to choose
When the stakes are high and you know you've got so much to lose

Then it all becomes very clear
You were born to be here

Let the games begin
Let the best one win
Let the fire light
Burn through the night
Let the whole world see
True victory
Let the games begin
Let the best one win

The will to win is all in your mind
So don't hold back, put it all on the line
Though it's hard to go on, be strong and keep pushing through
All your friends and your family back home, they have faith in you

Then it's all so very clear
There's a reason you're here

Let the games begin
Let the best one win
Let the fire light
Burn through the night
Let the whole world see
True victory, yeah
Let the games begin
Let the best one win---
