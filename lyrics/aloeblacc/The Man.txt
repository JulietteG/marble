I believe every lie that I ever told 
Paid for every heart that I ever stole 
I paid my cause and I didnt fold 
Well it aint that hard when you got soul (this is my world) 
Somewhere I heard that life is a test 
I been though the worst but still I give my best 
God made my mold different from the rest 
Then he broke that mold so I know Im blessed (this is my world) 

Stand up now and face the sun 
Wont hide my tail or turn and run 
Its time to do what must be done 
Be a king when kingdom comes

Ill be the teacher you could be the lesson 
Ill be the preacher you be the confession 
Ill be the quick relief to all your stressing (this is my world) 
Its a thin line between love and hate 
Is you really real or is you really fake 
Im a solider standing on my feet 
No surrender and I wont retreat (this is my world)

Wont hide my tail or turn and run 
Its time to do what must be done 
Be a king when kingdom comes
