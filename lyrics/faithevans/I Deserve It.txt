Make it hot for the summer, make it hot
Make it hot for the summer, make it hot
We gon' make it, make it hot
We gon' make it, make it hot
Lets go!

Everybody is looking for their one and only love
And Id be fool to settle for someone that isnt good enough
If youre gonna love me, love me right
Cause Ive played a fool too many times
If youre gonna love me, love me good
Or Ill find another man who will baby

Cause a girl like me is worth it
Only want the best cause I deserve it
Just hold me down, you ain't gotta be perfect
Cause a girl like me is worth it
Cause a girl like me is worth it
Only want the best cause I deserve it
Just hold me down, you ain't gotta be perfect
Cause a girl like me is worth it

Can anybody tell me where to start
Im looking for a man I can hand my heart, to effortlessly
Someone who will put a lot of effort in me
Read my description
Got my attention
Things I should mention
You gotta be strong and about your business boy, come on

Cause a girl like me is worth it
Only want the best cause I deserve it
Just hold me down, you ain't gotta be perfect
Cause a girl like me is worth it
Cause a girl like me is worth it
Only want the best cause I deserve it
Just hold me down, you ain't gotta be perfect
Cause a girl like me is worth it

Hey boy, you gotta do me proper if you wanna lock her
Go and get your act right, you don't need no Oscar
Baby, I ain't flawless, but I know I'm priceless
The way you get your on you turn me on like a light switch
Make 'em say oh, see, I'm attracted to the top notch, and you
A girl like me like 'em tall, dark and you
Keep it a hundred, then we straight
S to the H to the A to the R to the A to the Y to the A
Hey!

My man is smooth like butter and his voice got base
What a mighty good man, I keep his ass on a leash
We in the sizzack, he the mizzac, got me sweatin out my trizzack
He not perfect but he worth it and he got that big ol' dizzack, dizzack
My sex so good I make him come back
He know many men, he don't sleep or take a nizzap
We rizzap then we just sit back and relax
I always hold it down for my nigga, bring the beat back!

Cause a girl like me is worth it
Only want the best cause I deserve it
Just hold me down, you ain't gotta be perfect
Cause a girl like me is worth it
Cause a girl like me is worth it
Only want the best cause I deserve it
Just hold me down, you ain't gotta be perfect
Cause a girl like me is worth it

I need a good man
Tell me, will you be that?

Boy, I aint perfect
But I know that Im worth, yeah
Boy, I aint perfect
But I know that Im worth
Just be good to me
And baby Ill be good to you
You aint gotta be perfect
But baby just know that Im worth, yeah

Make it hot for the summer, make it hot
Make it hot for the summer, make it hot
I make it hot, I make it hot, I make it hot ---
