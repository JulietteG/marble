Friday night ain't get hit fast enough
They are like forever
Now there is here up trynna leave it all
Somebody told me this was the jumpoff
Ain't nothing better
So make room, invyall and fill up the cup for me

I missed the step oh we known
Get out my way (Get out my way)
Don't even try calling my phone
No not today (Not tonight)
Don't wanna argue and fuss and fight
No that's okay (No that's okay)
I'm trynna hit the flow and this my blues awake
Heey hey

Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
while i'm off in this party
Just wanna do my (do my thang) [x2]

Lil' mamma stepped on my good shoes
I ain't even trippin' (that's not right)
We're Divas don't stress on material things
(Sees the little face)
And no this called my good mood
(Am I watch you seeping)
Playas if you buying this whatever
I'm chillin' (Dance!)

I missed the step oh we known
Get out my way (Get out my way)
Don't even try calling my phone
No not today (Not tonight)
Don't wanna argue and fuss and fight
No that's okay (that's okay)
I'm trynna hit the flow and this my blues awake
Heey hey

Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
while i'm off in this party
Wanna do my (do my thang) [x2]

I ain't come here for no drama
All i want is do forget about my day
We can party all night long if you wanna
I don't care as long as i can do my thang

So don't missed the step oh we known
Get out my way (Get out my way)
Don't even try calling my phone
No not today (Not tonight)
Don't wanna argue and fuss and fight
No that's okay (that's okay)
I'm trynna hit the flow and this my blues awake
Heey hey

Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
while i'm off in this party
Wanna do my (do my thang) [x2]---Lyrics submitted by Valdir Verissimo.
