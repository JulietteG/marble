Everyday slips away.
Life becomes a soft hum
No reason your mind grows numb.
Stop making love.
Going through the motions.
Tell me how come no one gets what they really want?
And love only when it's convenient?
We act like we know more than we know.
We treat love like it's something you're owed.
That you're, owed! Owe owe owe owe! Owe owe owe, owe owe owe!

Yesterday, thought I heard you say,
Who do you think you're kidding?
We are all pissing into the wind.
Wearing sheeps skin.
Hiding in the same things that I danced in.
But no one gets what they really want.
And love only when it's convenient.
We act like we know more than we know.
We treat love like it's something you're owed.

But maybe I've found you .
Maybe I've found something I love.
Maybe I've found you.
Maybe I've found something I love.
